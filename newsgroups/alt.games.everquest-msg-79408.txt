Or not ... From elsewhere in the thread :

"As of May 13, 2001, the following information was confirmed directly
to Niami, by Yakatizma (tradeskills developer at Verant) <SNIP>

INT & WIS: whichever of the two is higher will affect skill increases
when practicing ALL tradeskills. The higher either your INT or WIS is,
the greater the chance you have for a skill gain while tradeskilling.

STR: higher strength will give you an added bonus to your chance at
gaining skill increases while smithing. 


Almost right.

Jim
