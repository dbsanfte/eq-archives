}This guy is being abused he has the right to play his game too.

I certainly wouldn't argue that he's letting himself be taken advantage 
of.  Abused seems a strong word, though.

This just seems so contrary to my experience of druids in a guild, though.

Let me set the scene:  I'm dual-boxing, Zin and my Ranger, Ryck, who are 
in different guilds.  Zinny is sitting on the toxx spires, on his way to 
stonebrunt.

This is /gu in the second guild, the one Zinny isn't even in.  Although he 
was, once upon a time.  I would find this sort of thing to be a fairly 
typical occurrance.

<Ryck> ...so I guess I'll just head Zinny down here to buff me up. :)
<druid1> Where is he?  I'll come port you.
<druid2> you're in nexus, right?  BRT
<Warrior1> My druid bot is in Bazaar, zone over there, I'll log him.
<Ryck> Err... he's sitting on the toxx spire, isn't that a bit silly?
<druid1> np, I'm bound there, omw
<druid2> take the invite, gnomie!
<Warrior1> o ok. :)
<Ryck> you guys are that hard up for c2?

*Zin c2's druid2 and takes the invite.  c2 won't stick.

<druid1> No, I have KEI
<druid2> KEI hehe
<Ryck> dayamn, either I'm really loved, or you guys are bored. :)
<druid1> yup bored. :)
<druid2> lol, inc toxx
<warrior1> Aww, who doesn't love Zin?

Gotta love having a guild that's 40% druids. :) More often than not, 
druid2 would then come along to PL Ryck with me. :)
