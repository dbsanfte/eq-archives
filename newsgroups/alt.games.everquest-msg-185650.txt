There's some nice piercing weapons out there for pallies. I didn't see your
original post so don't know what level you are. Things like the MoQ, Centi
spear and any of the war lances use piercing.
Plus, what's more of an icon than a pally in plate sitting atop his trusty
steed and a lance in his hand? ;-)
Just wish we could be holding a shield and a lance at the same time. Now
that would be truly fitting.
