Wow, men, ok... please... take a deep breath.  I apologize for asking a
question with such an *obvious* answer.
(I knew there would be a few people who would point out how the answer was so
*obvious*).  And I probably could have taken the time to go through the
hundreds of "link item" references I got on my google and dejanews searches.  
But I really didn't want to spend *hours* going through them and I knew some
nice person here would probably help me out  - and of course yall came through
for me.  I thank those people very, very much - I can link now!  And if I ever
have the answers to your *obvious* questions I'll be sure and let you know :)
