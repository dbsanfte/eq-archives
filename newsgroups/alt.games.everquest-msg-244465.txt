Selling items and plat aside as it exists at the moment, briefly.  The real
concern for me is this,

1. stuff takes time to get
2. some people don't have that time
3. maker of game sells some in-game stuff for real cash
4. people without much time buy them
5. maker of game realises that if stuff is _really_ hard to get, more
people will spend real cash to get it
6. maker of game decided that there is no benefit in making things easy to
get, and that 15 hours camps are the best profit generating camps ........
