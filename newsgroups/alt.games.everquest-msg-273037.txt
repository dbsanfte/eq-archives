Not exactly. I try to say exactly what I mean. I try to not imply
things. While I am not a lawyer, I do try to keep track of things.
But you tell me how I misunderstand what is legal, I'm a
Cherokee-Scot-American. The Cherokee didn't break any laws when they
were ordered to move west. They won in Court, but that didn't stop
the forced move.

Well, the Japanese-Americans were legally incarcerated. They were
not charged with comitting any crimes. They were placed in
internment camps because some racists convinced FDR that the
Japanese-Americans were a danger to America. Executive Order put
them in the internment camps. I don't know the constitutional
ramafications of that Order, but I certainly think it was morally
wrong.

Hmm. The ones who arrested minorities didn't always file charges.
And I hate to disappoint the others here, but there were laws,
legally passed and unchallenged for many years, that people could be
shot and killed or they could be jailed because there were laws that
boiled down to 'it needed doing'. Defendants even stated that on
being put on trial, 'the victim needed killing', they were found not
guilty. Its sad that several people deny such laws ever existed.
Hopefully those laws are gone.

Morally wrong, but it wasn't illegal, it was the law of the land.

I'm sure some of the younger posters here think all that needed to
be done was some one to speak up. Why that was wrong, just speak up.
Wouldn't have worked as that was a good way to get dead. After the
U.S. feds became involved in civil rights, it became slightly less
of a death sentence to speak up.

Oh, things have improved. But I've lived long enough to see the
pendulum swing back and forth a few times between safe to speak up
and get beat up or killed if someone speaks up.

The veneer of civil rights is much thinner than some folks are
willing to believe.
