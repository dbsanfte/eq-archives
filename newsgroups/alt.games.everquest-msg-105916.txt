What guild are you in and on what server?  I know that my guild is short 
of druids, and not just for port whores.  Whiners get left out because 
they're whiners.  There are decent clerics I won't group with because 
they're whiners, but it doesn't mean that clerics suck.  It means the 
person playing the cleric sucks.  I'm a fucking bard, a swiss-army knife, 
a druid without root, and I still love druids in my group.  Hell, the 
other night we killed all the corrupted stuff in WL for a long-time friend 
with druids, rangers, and bards.  Including the corrupted Unicorn (though 
we had a 60 warrior come tank that one, the fucker is a level 60 with a 
pet).
