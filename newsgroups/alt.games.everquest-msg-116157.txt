Can be for either reason, or any reason that two guild leaders might think
of for declaring war on each other.

A guild I was in almost started a secondary guild made up exclusively of our
own alts... partly for the purpose of guildwaring with ourselves just for
fun.  The plan never panned out, even though we did get the second guild
approved.....we just never did it.

Real guild wars are very very rare.  Most folk who would really want to
guildwar are already playing on the PvP servers, so they don't need to.
