Not quite.  Here's how it went.

At first, the firepots existed, but required a key, which was not available.
These are the firepots that are the mystery.

When the Kunark expansion was added, there was a room in Timorous Deep that
contained several firepots, which did not require keys.  After about a week,
Timorous Deep was changed so that you could not bind in that zone.

A little while ago, Timorous Deep was changed back to allowing binding.
This was actually a mistake, Verant says, but they had been planning to do
it, so they will leave it that way.

Yesterday, the patch changed the destinations of some of the TD firepots.  I
believe that they were fixed in one of the emergency patches.

So, basically nothing has changed (other than the brief retargeting) with
the firepots.  The pre-kunark firepots still are useless, because of no
keys.  The TD firepots still work.  All that's changed is that you can bind
in TD, making them much more convenient.
