Minimum level of 60 to attend, you cant try one yet. Even on normal they are
hard. Figure 4-5 mobs on zonein that hit for 900s and must be killed to get
a place to setup. If you cannot kill 5 mobs with 30k hps and that hit for
900s with a random selection of your raid force dont try a raid. On the
bright side some of them may not see invis so if you get really lucky you
may have 15 seconds or so to setup.

The drops you get are of elemental quality. You will have to actually suceed
the raid to see many drops though. Raids give twice as much time for all
aspects of the adventure as normal. (3 hrs to do one, an hour to get set up
outside). They hold a maximum of 36 people none lower than 60.
