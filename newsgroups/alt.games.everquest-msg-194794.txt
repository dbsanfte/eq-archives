Well I have a 60 druid.  And I have a 60 mage.  And I have a wiz.

The reason I'm leveling a wiz is because I want big nukes.  

It totally totally sucks if druid is outnuking a wiz.

As a 60 mage I was over and over frustrated with being expected to
nuke in raids and I had poopy amunition.  My druid actually did
better.  She was a great nuker, but no one knew that.  Poor druid was
always stuck in oddball groups in raids.

So now, finally, I have a wiz up.  About to be raid level.  And I'm
hearing go back to druid????

Sheesh cant win for losing.

Well I love my wiz and someday she will indeed have manaburn.  Then
all others watch out.  For now, she is hanging in there.  Ouch wiz is
hard.
