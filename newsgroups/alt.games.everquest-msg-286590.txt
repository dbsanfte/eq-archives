Maybe this should go into the FAQ; we've seen a lot of this sort
of question recently.

If you have a single toon that crashes your client whenever you try
to log in, then chances are you've got some corrupted files.  It
might be the files for that character (charname_servername.ini and
UI_charname_servername.ini), or it could be the files for the zone
that character is in (usually the 3 map files, but I suppose it could
even be the audio track).

Rename the two character files (or just drag them out of the EverQuest
folder to your desktop) and see if that lets you log in on that toon.
If so, try to narrow down which part of which file causes the crash.
(Usually once you find the broken part of the file it's obvious, at
least if you're used to looking inside those files.)  If it still
crashes, try moving the three map files for that zone, do a full file
check to get fresh maps created, and try again.

One or the other of those has just about always fixed this sort of
problem for me.
