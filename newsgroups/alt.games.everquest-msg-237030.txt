Actually. I *want* their to be a reason, so its rational as it follows
from this that I must be open to the possibility.

But that just backs it up a step... Is it rational to *want* a reason?

And maybe if you push on the definition of rational hard enough you
can squeeze a no out of that, but I firmly believe its perfectly
rational.

The alternative...is that there is no reason to exist.

Our planet will die, our sun will die, and our universe will die of
entropy if nothing else. If it is all to be for nothing then there is
little value of doing anything but maximing your enjoyment while
you're here.

 In its simplest form if one firmly beleives there is no reason to
exist...its strikes me that hedonism and narcissism should be the
highest pursuits. What is the value of 'a greater good' of 'scientific
advancement' of 'community participation' of 'sacrifice' of 'charity'
or anything else like it except where its subservient to hedonistic
narcissism.
