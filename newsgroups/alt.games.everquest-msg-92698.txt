Yes you can make hotkeys for your inventory and weapon slots just like you
do for anything else.  Then you can pick something up from the hotkey slot
and swap with the other hotkey slot.  I do that all the time in between
fights when I want to heal with lute.  I have not yet tried to twist spells
and instruments simultaneously, but I have heard it is doable.
