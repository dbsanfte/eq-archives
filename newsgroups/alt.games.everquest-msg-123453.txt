OK, good. Someone brought this up for me!  I've just created a DE
Necro, and got him to level 10.  Now, according to Allakhazams, all
the Necro newbie armor quests are attainable between 5-10.  Most of
the ingredients, sure, says I.  BUT....how the holy old HELL do you go
about getting those halfling hides?  All the halfling spawn points
feature the little beggars packed so close together that attempting to
pull one brings the whole crowd down on your arse.  I'm about to bring
my ranger in to knock some heads, and to hell with faction issues, but
I'd prefer to have my necro do it on his own.  Any input is MORE than
welcome.
