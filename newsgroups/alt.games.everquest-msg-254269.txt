Well, I'm currently working on a 29 level druid. Outside areas with
animals that you can charm and/or fear are going to be good for you.
I *think* I stayed in North and East Karana until sometime in my
early twenties and then spent the last five levels or so in Stonebrunt.
(I went to Stonebrunt as soon as I had the port, which was a week or
so before the PoK book to Gunthak came active.) I'm on a hiatus from
my druid since I got her to a point that I really needed her and will
go back to her someday. But, at 29, the gorillas and pandas and adders
and some of the kobolds are still dkblue to me and give 2-5% XP per
kill. I haven't even been farther into the mountains than the kobold
camp by the river and there are plenty of mobs to hunt.

At some point, probably in the mid-30's, I will switch to the cave
basilisks in Jaggedpine and, when I can (probably early or mid-40's)
I will head out into Jaggedpine itself and work on the griffons and
anacondas. (Jaggedpine is, IMO, a druid/ranger heaven. When in wolf
form, the griffons won't aggro on you even when they fly right through
you while you're killing another griff.) I soloed my ranger from
mid-40's to early 50s in JPF.
