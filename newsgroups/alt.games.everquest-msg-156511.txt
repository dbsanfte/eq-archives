> target.
> - /raidinvite - invites the current target to the raid
> - /raidaccept - accepts an invitation to a raid
> - /raiddecline - declines an invitation to a raid.
> - /raidremove - removed the current raid target from the raid
> - /setloottype <#> - sets the raid loot type - Takes one number argument:
1,
> 2, 3.
> - /addraidlooter - adds a raid member as an early looter to all future
