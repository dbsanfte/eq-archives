Yea, that's one of the leading theories.  And probably a good fraction of 
learning is in the interconnections.  Neurons do retain some degree of 
chemical state, too, that could account for some of it.  And muscles also 
have some degree of memory.  So it really depends on exactly what it is 
that was learned.  And the problem's really too complicated for a nice 
simple answer.
