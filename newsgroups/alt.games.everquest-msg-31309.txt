    Point is, if he and all the "blue trash" actually followed your advice,
then it wouldn't work - you'd all be fighting over the formerly-quiet spots.

    Goes to your advice. Doesn't help him being told "XP in out-of-the-way
places" if he plays one of the many classes that needs to group, as by
definition nobody is AT an "out-of-the-way" place.

    I doubt motivated PvP will ever be a codable thing.

    I can see that. But that's not his complaint. He's not "engaging" in
PvP, it comes to him and gacks him seemingly "at random". You contend it
isn't random, his actions make him a victim. But a lot of the things you say
make someone a victim - no DoT slots, improper PvP spell load - just can't
be seen by the attacker until they attack. So what he contends is true - the
majority of these attacks are totally random, and THAT is what gets him
upset. That, and the losing, of course. ;-)

    Didn't say your goals are "bad" or wrong, but again: if they don't mesh
with his, your advice will be poor at best.

    Do you find that the PvP rogues bother using poisons when they set up an
attack, or do they just trust in double backstabs to drop you?

    And the big problem is, it only takes one person to make what he's doing
VERY hazardous. ;-)

    I saw that, but I thought you folks reformed as "Deebee" or some
likewise-goofy name. Did that fall flat?

    That doesn't just happen on a PvP server. ;-)

    How are your points standaings on your druid?
