One PDA app I was going to work on (but like you, never got around to) was
to keep track of prices.  Everytime I was a price on something, I'd enter
it into the PDA (under the appropriate item), then the app would give me
an average, low and high price (using some scheme for deprecating old
number) for when I wanted to actually buy or sell that item and wasn't
sure if it was a good deal.

The ability to trade this data with other people on your server (or
potentially in your guild) would make it even more valuable.

Cheers,

John
