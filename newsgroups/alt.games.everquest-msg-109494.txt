Hi:

I've been playing on the Legends server from day one and I have to say that
really it's *never* worth the money that I'm currently paying. A lot of
interesting things have happened and to be rather blunt I'm not happy about
many aspects of Legends. Let me try and explain ..

Before Legends went live I was under the impression that the new server was
going have a lot of dynamic content, plus many events and in-game maps.
Well, the in-game maps are not there, maybe I was misled on that one, but
the dynamic content simply is not there. The so called *events* are nothing
short of farcical, with 99% of them being stupid Gnome versus Dwarf wars in
Ak'Anon or Steamfont. Of course you all have to de-guild for this wonderful
PvP *event* which meant that guild leaders cannot take part otherwise the
guild they head will disband once they de-guild. I have yet to see one good
event on Legends, who the heck wants PvP crap *all* the time? IMHO if the
*events* are thought up by the GM's then they are seriously lacking in
imagination.

Within the opening hours of Legends there was one guild that really were so
strong it was pitiful. Township Rebellion boasts a myriad of members, all
standing at level 60 (nothing wrong with that) but to me this shows total
overkill. From day one is was clear to me as well as many others that
Township Rebellion pretty much owned the server, but more on that in a
moment.

The nice thing about Legends is that the forty to fifty level hunting zones
are pretty sparse, enabling there to be lots of mobs to kill and fast
experience. On the third day of Legends running I was sitting in the Eastern
Wastelands which wasn't really that busy, when into the zone comes a GM and
a few level 60 characters. I will not mention the guild that they belonged
to, other than to say that they are rather well known now. The GM then
announced to the zone that she was going to force-spawn a mob for the
players that had arrived with her, and that if anyone should die as a result
of the spawning they would receive GM rezzes. I was totally enraged, and
sent the GM a tell asking why she felt the need to force spawn this mob, and
was flabbergasted when the only reply she could give me was, and I quote 'It
needs to be spawned for them' - What utter nonsense, why couldn't they wait
like everyone else has to, and I strongly protested. Yes it was fine that
should anyone die as a result the GM would rez them, but why the heck should
those people, going about their business have to wait around for a rez? Some
might want to log, why should they be inconvenienced?

I asked the GM if she would force spawn the AC in OOT on request, and was
promptly told 'No' - so I asked her what the difference was in spawning one
mob for one and not for another. After all, if you're going to force spawn
stuff do it for everyone.

The GM ended up be being rather abrupt to me and so I dropped the subject,
but still I was as mad as hell.

The Web-based stuff might look cool, but in reality it's nothing more than
eye-candy. The Site is usually *well* behind in updating any new gear I
might acquire, and is very frequently down. I've had to write to Sony no
less than three times to get my profile working, why should I have to do
this, I'm *paying* well for this service. Basically, whilst it's nice to
have a Web-based representation of the zones I've been to, what's the point?
I *know* what zones I've been to. I *know* where I'm bound and can see where
my guild mates are by doing a simple /who all guild name.

We were also promised that GM's would keep a very, very close eye on guilds
that become too strong or overly influence the way that the server is
running, and yet Township Rebellion have shown total disregard for other
players in stopping certain loot from dropping and have caused a lot of bad
feeling on the server, hence so many people leaving. And before you accuse
me of being anti-Township Rebellion, I'm not, I'm just trying to answer the
question that was asked concerning what Legends is like. It's one rule for
one, and one for another.

You may ask why I haven't moved back to my old server yet, and my answer
would be, why should I? I wanted to have the pleasure of being involved in
something unique, and as yet all I've gotten is a very bitter taste about
the whole Legends thing. The idea was great, the functionality didn't work.
But I'm staying in the hope of there being some *huge* improvements. When I
went to Legends I told myself I'd try it for six months, and that's what I
intend to do.

The whole economy is screwed up so badly that it's a joke, with people
paying as much as 1000pp for *one* Black Pearl. Just about every low level
character is an alt twink, and that makes it so very hard for a *true*
newbie (or lowbie) to play, no one wants to by the stuff they make, they can
't earn enough to get very far, other than to grind it out killing a huge
amount of gutter trash just to move on up. I hunted Spiderling Silks for
many, many days just to get enough to buy some half decent gear at my low
level, but not many people want the silks as they're virtually all twinked
with gear that's befitting a level 40 or 50 player.

Something needs to be done about the Ore quest in Ocean of Tears too,
because I know people that are making 100,000pp per *day* from the MQ
exploit. This is badly, badly wrong, as all that's happening is that high
level players converge upon the Ocean of Tears and farm the Ore. The /ooc
arguing there is almost representative of newbie's fighting over 100pp. The
GM's are meant to be there to help and smooth the game out, yet only
yesterday a friend of mine, hunting Ore in the Ocean of Tears was *given*
Ore by a GM. She sent me a tell to let me know, so I had it from the horses
mouth. This type of GM behavior is despicable in my opinion. Even though my
friend was the beneficiary of the Ore *given* to her, she was already making
100,000pp per day, greed, greed, greed.

I was witness to some rather foul language on the auction chat channel by
one individual in particular, and I know for a fact that this guy was
reported, as many said so in open chat. What happened? Nothing .. the GM
arrived into the auction chat channel and was basically giving the
impression that she couldn't care less, as the guy who'd been so very vulgar
seemed to be her friend. Ah well, to sum it up Legends is, at the moment
nothing more than a nightmare.

Those are my heartfelt observations of the Legends server, everyone had
their own opinions, those are mine.

As always, safe hunting to you all,

Stevie.
