LOL!! No one ever does, but there always is. I once ran clear past the
zone from BB to QH one time, and was just sitting there turning around
wondering why the hell I wasn't in QH. I walked around for a bit, just
checking stuff out, and decided it was time to get back to the zone. I
ended up zoning into QH from the QH side of the zone line. =)
