Easy to fix - just don't write any code last week :)



You know what I hate? I'm working on a little pet project right now,
using some spiffy components from TurboPower. I wrote what I thought
was correct code, but it doesn't work. So I pulled up the demo program
and took a look at that code, which does work. Naturally, as near as I
can tell, my code is identical, expect for the fact that it isn't
functional. Go figure.
