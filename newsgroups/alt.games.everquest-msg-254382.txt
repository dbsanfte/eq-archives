It's probably because he was trying to outtaunt a DPS melee class that
was several levels higher than him and odds are, trying to do it
against mobs of a high enough level where his taunt button was
useless. There's no chance of that warrior, no matter how good the
player, holding agro consistently in that situation unless he's
twinked to such an extent that he's outdamaging the berzerker who was
6(?) levels higher than him. 

That warrior might have been clueless but I don't think you blame him
for not being able to hold agro. Clueless would be a more apt
description of any group that expected him to hold agro in that
situation.
