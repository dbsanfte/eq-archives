Dye is applied to an armor slot, not to a piece of armor.  The only armor 
that can be dyed and then sold in that new color is fine steel plate 
armor.  The fine steel armor dyes are different, and require a smith to 
apply them, unlike the prismatic dyes that anyone can use on armor slots 
rather than armor pieces.

If I dye my leggings slot blue, and then get new leggings, they will be 
blue (or some facsimile thereof depending on their original color), even 
if you had dyed your leggings slot red, then sold them to me.
