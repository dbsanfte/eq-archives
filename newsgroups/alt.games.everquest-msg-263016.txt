Actually, not any moron can do that evidently, as witnessed by my last 
grouping experience with a Paladin MA.  He could not hold agro worth crap 
with me slowing and casting one single DoT.  Of course, he was using 
undead nukes instead of agro spells.  Did the same camp with an SK MA 
later, and I could do damned near anything I wanted to the mobs without 
ever once having it target me.
