Exactly my feelings. Foxeye is very very close to hitting her personal
glass ceiling in gear. Any upgrades from here on would literally require
100k+ items.  So it's far more fun to blow all my money at the casino.

That being said, I stopped after 5k last night (partly because I had
tickets to see RotK, woohoo!) and I may hold onto my 25k for a while, in
case the plat sink works fast enough that prices start to come down
already.  

My experience thus far was oddly successful. IN addition the usually
stacks of stat food  and gnomish fireworks (I never consider it to be a
waste if I get fireworks...), I won one of the sleeper's tomb resist
stones. And a nice one at that...the white one with 35 svm.  To be quite
honest, there are times enough when I've lamented my poor magic resistence
(like when mobs are trying to fear me), that paying 5k for a 35 svm range
slot item is actually a fair price to me. 

So I walked away rather pleased. And yes, that was from the "normal"
tickets, not a golden ticket.
