I would agree, with the following caveat: Splitpaw seems to be where a
lot of people are (finally) learning to group after 30+ levels of
soloing, if my experience there is any indication. 

If you get into a bad group in Paw (eg, player 1: "OOM" player 2:
"OOM" player 3: "Need a heal!" player 4: "Buffs going" player 5:
"Pulling Rosch to group"), start looking for the exit and another
group, it's just a matter of time until the wipeout.
