Even chain casting nukes when they refresh (with SCF3 and focii no
less) at maximum haste with 1800+ ATK and fairly decent weapons any
random Rogue with Freebringer and whatever else he bought in the
bazaar can out DPS me in melee by a good 10-25%.  He can do it all
night long without breaking sweat and can even afford to miss a few BS
opportunities along the way.

I still don't have Ambidex (bleh, 9 points) and haven't anywhere near
maxed my melee crits AA but even with all those spent I doubt I'll
ever get near 200 DPS in melee consistently.  Your average level 65
Rogue probably does though.
