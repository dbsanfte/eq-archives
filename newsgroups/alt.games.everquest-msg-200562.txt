If KEI was added to the game last week and they "bug" fixed it so the group
and mgb worked liked the single target cast I would say sure bug fix.

KEI wasn't added recently....it is a nerf.

If you don't want KEI affecting your gameplay don't get it and don't group
with those that get it.
Let whoever wants it get it. /shrug
