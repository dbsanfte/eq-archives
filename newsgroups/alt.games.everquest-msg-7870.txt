You are right.
When I had my character there in January, I was hunting the bloodgills
under the water starting at lvl 45.
I was able to make it through 45 in about 8 hours, then only 5 hours
each for lvls 46 - 51.
The XP was great. There were threads all over the message boards about
how great this was for the highger levels.
Then the Great Verant decided that we were having too much fun there
and decided to hit it with the Nerf Stick.
Bastards.
Why couldn't they just leave it alone?
What was the big deal?
It is still great XP, just not as good as it was.
Bastards.
