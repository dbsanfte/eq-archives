Still seems an unnecessary complication. You are hoping the creatures
hit the tank first or he taunts them in time. I still don't see how
it any better then the tank taunting them in the first place. The tank
shouldn't be running far to taunt mobs anyway and not out of range of
the healers spells, in case he agros more then he bargained and can't
get back the group in time.

And in my experience the scout often ends up dead or nearly dead before
he reaches the group.
