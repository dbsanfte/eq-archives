Hey, you shoulda heard the guy in our group bragging about how he loved 
'helping out the n00bs' - referring to *us*, most of whom were 1 level 
below him.  Then he seemed shocked when the healers didn't want to help 
him too much because he kept typing gibberish during fights adding plenty 
of spam even *with* everything but my own hits and spells turned off - 
and then claiming he'd been shouting for heals the whole time.  *rolls 
eyes*

So anyway, no real group learning experiences before 20 then?  I've been 
worrying about how I work in a group - am I good/bad/average, etc.  The 
toughest problem (and I always get a sarcastic oh poor BABY for this one) 
is deciding which spells to scribe.  Do I be a buffing-tank or a nuking-
caster-oops-oom-tanking-now?
