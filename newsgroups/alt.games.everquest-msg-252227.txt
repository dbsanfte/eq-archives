That is an issue that has never been ruled on in a court of law in the US 
to this date to the best of my knowledge.  Under the current laws of at

The platinum has a tangible real world value, as evidenced by the brisk 
market that exists to exchange it.  The only question that really needs 
to be answered is who does it actually belong to.  SoE says it is theirs, 
US law has little to say about it as of yet.
