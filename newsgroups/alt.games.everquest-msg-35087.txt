It will temporarily disable a trap. If I recall the developer note about it
correctly,
the duration is something like 20 seconds of safety. I don't have this skill yet
but I'm
suspecting that Befallen, that bastion of rogue-skill training, would be a good
place to train it. The room with the second key-warder has a pit-trap
right in front of the door. If you've been keeping your sense traps skill
trained
up (I have a hot-key I use when I run long distance that hits sense traps,
forage, sneak and sense heading) then you should be able to sense the trap
and practice disarming it.

My understanding is that the some of the higher level dungeons have or will
have some traps in them that will make this skill worthwhile.
