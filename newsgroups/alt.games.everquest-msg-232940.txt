If you've swapped cables with a known good one, and swapped ports on 
your router with a known good one and the lights are still dead at both 
ends your ethernet port on your network card is dead. Its possible 
you've got a broken wire in the jack itself, which would not affect 
windows ability to determine that it is working correctly.

Until you've got link lights there is no reason to bother with network 
preferences, pinging, etc. The *only* setting I've ever heard of that 
can bugger up the actual link is the link speed and duplex options. 
10mbps at half duplex through 100mbps at full duplex, but these have all 
been reliably autosensed for many years now, and its highly unlikely 
there is an issue with that, particularly since the connection was 
working previously... and even if you set it wrong... assuming you've 
got a dsl router that acts like a switch there is no 'wrong' setting 
that simply wouldn't work.

The good news is a decent popular nic like the dlink dfe-530tx is very 
inexepensive. Maybe 10 bucks.

Borrow the cable and router port from the Mac first... you won't bugger 
up the Macs connection. Its a Mac ;) it'll figure it out. After that its 
time for a new nic.

Good luck.
