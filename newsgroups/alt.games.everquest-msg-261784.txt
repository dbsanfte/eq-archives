Since the patch, all the mobs in WOS are completely slowable. NO mitigation. 
Even the named.
I dont really see the need for this change. Mobs were easy enough before, 
esp considering the nice loot they dropped.
I would have nerfed their run speed in preference. Its tiresome when you 
need a bard to pull (to some camps) esp since bards are a very rare class.
