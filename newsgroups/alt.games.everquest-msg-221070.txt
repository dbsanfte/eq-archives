Could be.  Nerf Paladins and that will change overnight.

There was a time when knights had, in effect, _no_ role.  This was due
to a long list of misconceptions and errors by the original dev team.
[This is entirely understandable, BTW.  I am noting the fact, not
criticizing their efforts.]  From this Paladin's perspective (and that
of many others, AFAICT), the current furor among the Warriors smells
an awful lot like a campaign to return to the bad old days.  That
political aspect to the debate is bound to color it, perhaps even end
up defining it.  That said, I firmly believe that when circumstances
demand the _best_ tank (i.e. challenging raid bosses) there should be
only one place to turn:  the Warrior.  Just as surely as the _best_
healer is the Cleric.  When your character's abilities are so tightly
focused on one aspect of play you need to be the best or your class is
pointless.

Leapfrog agro is a nice tactic.  I've used it in LDoN where I was
puller and Warrior was MT.  One of the best groups I've had worked
that way (but it is _hard_ to get people to go along with the idea
of having two tanks in the group).

KEI'd casters in an LDoN group with a 52+ BL (no horsies there) have
20/tick standing mana regen.  But that's only part of it.  The Paladin
pulling for that group also has 20/tick mana regen.  Unless he's an
idiot he's going to have agro locked very nearly 100% of the time.  He
can Pacify freely, never bringing more mobs than his group can handle.
He can cast spot/group heals reasonably often, and save his one good
stun for when an add goes after a caster, and generally just be much
more effective than a Warrior could in the same setting.  DPS classes
actually gain in effectiveness alongside the Paladin-as-tank vs. the
Warrior tank.  The difference in effectiveness between the Warrior and
all casting classes is too large, Warriors need the ability to magnify
DPS classes in an XP setting.  Warriors should be preferred for some
settings, equal for others, and good enough in the rest.  In the eyes
of many other players, right or wrong, they aren't even close to that
right now.
