Make sure you're not in "Work offline" mode in Internet Explorer.

I was on earlier this morning with no problems.  I shut down to go do some
stuff and now I'm trying
to log on and can't even get the patcher to come up.  I just get a box that
says "Patching
Everquest" in the title and "Connecting...." in the little box.  After a
while it says it failed.

I also can't get to www.everquest.com either.  Is it just me or what?  I use
RoadRunner in the
Milwaukee, WI area...

Thanks.
