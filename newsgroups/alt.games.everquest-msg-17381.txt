Full Bird refers to a Colonel (O-6 paygrade in the US Army, Marines, and Air
Force) also called a "Full Colonel."  Although I did hear a squid refer to a
Naval Captain as a "full bird" once (same pay grade, but in the US Navy,
also the same emblem on a fatigue or duty uniform [not sure of the precise
navy terms for their uniforms]).

The terms "Silver Leaf," "Leaf Colonel," "Light Colonel," "Light Bird,"
"Half Bird," "El See," and "Major---er, Colonel" are all slang terms for
Lieutenant Colonel (O-5 pay grade in US Army, Marines, and Air Force).  At
one time or another I've heard all of these, though some are certainly more
common than others.  Probably "Light Colonel" and "Maj---er, Colonel" are
the two most common spoken expressions when refering to an LTC, but the
others have seen use.

Funny true story from when I was in basic training:
DI: "What does a silver oak leaf on the shoulder mean, recruit?"
Recruit: "Light Colonel."
DI <now screaming>: "LIGHT Colonel?!  What?!  As opposed to a HEAVY
Colonel?!  Are you saying your commander is over weight?  You don't think he
can out run you, lardbutt?  Maybe you need to go show us how fast YOU can
run!  MOVE IT..." etc.

I was real glad that the DI couldn't see my face at that moment.

(Oh, and for the uninnitiated, the term "squid" which I used above is an
"affectionate" term for a member of the Navy.)
