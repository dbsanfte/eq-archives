I think that the reason is the imminent release of DAoC... They don't
want to give the competition a chance to claim "we took away X number of
EQ players in our first week", players that would probably trickle back
over time if DAoC turns out to suck as hard as AO. 

I like having the numbers there, but I understand VI's position. EQ will
do better or worse than DAoC on its own merits, but there is no reason
for VI to hand Mythic's Marketing department any freebies.
