a halfing warrior following rallos zek can wear fierce heraldic, you may
also be able to wear the SK version (name slips my mind atm)  my ogre
warrior has one piece of the stuff meant for sk's who follow rallos, cuz it
also lets warriors wear, but im not sure off hand if halfings can wear that
too.


on the other hand, if you choose brell. you can wear underfoot stuff.
