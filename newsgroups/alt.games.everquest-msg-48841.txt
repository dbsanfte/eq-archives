 If I ever get DAoC going here I may well stop playing EQ. I don't 
hate it, but frankly, after getting one character to 60, a few others
fairly high in level and trying all the others classes a bit I've
pretty much seen and done all there is to do in EQ. I'm just tired 
of it. I'm tire of VI constantly fixing or adding new things and
screwing up other things that worked just fine. I've just got to 
the point where I don't feel a compelling desire to log on. I want
something new and I won't be playing EQ if I start getting into 
DAoC.
 
 I've been holding on til SoL went live hoping there might be 
something there to keep me interested but without any 50+ zones
being added, the pets and the new character models (which IMHO
are just plain awful so far) it's just not going to be enough
to keep me playing I'm afraid. 
 
 I'll hang on a bit longer, but frankly I can see the end coming
for me and EQ. It's been a hell of a lot of fun, but not any
more.   8^/
