That's the matter for debate, but a good point.  No, I really can't think of
many items that give you CHA and INT.  The cool looking blue & green robe
from CC (I think it's called the blackened crystallized robe?) has
both...and my Thurgadin crown does, but that's high level.  I honestly
haven't paid much attention to other CHA gear to see if it has other useful
stats.

At around level 16 enchanters get their first CHA buff.  Around level 34(?)
they get their first INT buff (well, it's a WIS buff, but you get some INT
too).

A couple opalline earrings (unrest bartender), drakescale leggings (sola
bartender), crude stein (oggok indoor guards...try to avoid hurting
faction...let someone else kill these guys).  Right there that's ...errr...
30 CHA I think.  And, as someone else posted, but I suspect is right, CHA
doesn't have THAT much affect on mezzing anyway.
