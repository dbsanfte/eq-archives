The ones "ignoring" your added comment might be LoY-less players just simply
doing it the old fashioned way with "/who all lfg cleric" so they never see
the comment.
I found myself using this method when trying to find members after noticing
the LFG tool crashed my computer if I used the LFM part of the tool, it
seems to have stabilised after the last batch of patches that ran during my
computerless vacation. I haven't had one crash the last week using the LFG
tool.
