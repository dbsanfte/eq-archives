Spent some time there last night and going back again tonight.  Good
sport but you aptly describe it hehe.  Not sure what its called but we
were at the buildings out and to the left as you come in from
Dawnshroud.  With our usual non enchanter party we had multiple adds
rooted most of the night waiting their turn and several runs to the zone
along with a few rezes when the warrior tried a few too many vamps at
one time from another spot.  

If you are unfamiliar with fighting unmezzed add flurries I would
imagine it was horrible.... we had a blast cause we are crazy enough to
enjoy that sort of stuff.  I especially enjoyed the point late in the
evening when my cleric was able to pinpoint the exact moment when he
would be swarmed by the adds and warned the group to get ready for it. 
We almost got it under control again but down to half a bubble of hp and
using my last barrier to ward off the 4 or 5 on  me led to a unanimous
group call of "RUN!" hehe.  Can't speak to the loot, we found nothing
special, but again, if you like dangerous fighting there is no shortage
of that.
