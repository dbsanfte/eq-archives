This is from "Forgotten Halls" - well, I think that's the name.  My ranger
played there one night with my chanter friend.  It didn't work very well.
We pulled the bat room and the rat room, both were all dark blue to us at 58. 
There was no agro whatsoever, you could single pull.  They were all indifferent
so I don't think there was a bad faction hit even after killing some.  We tried
fear kiting but only *some* of them were fearable.  When we would zone out -
set up a hot key for that - and zone back in, the mob would still be right
there, but was still indifferent so you could go get a different one if you
wanted.  Again, the 1st one would not agro even if you were standing on top of
it killing another.  
I'm guessing if you stepped into the thing that looks like a transporter you
would go somewhere else, but I was too chicken to do it....
I, for one, was terribly unimpressed.  There are certainly better places for a
ranger / chanter combo to get experience.....
