Biz, I hope you're right. I hate to think of having to wait til August for
the release. The little town I live in probably has no more than 10,000
people and they've held it for 5 weeks now. Almost a record. I saw it twice
today. Once with my sister-in-law and my brother (and she kept whispering to
him, telling him the plotline the whole time... arrrrgh) and then tonight,
by myself. I don't know what it is about it -- even apart from my ...
fascination ...with Legolas... but the movie itself makes me feel good. It
makes me laugh, cry, chew my fingernails... (even after 8-9 times seeing
it!) I suppose, for me, that that's at least one mark of a good flick. I'll
just be glad when I can watch it whenever I feel like popping in the DVD :)
