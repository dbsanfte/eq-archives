I come from E.Marr and was playing my little 11 Necromancer when I noticed
something strange.  In the middle of nowhere, a podium. A stone podium with
an open stone book. Not only one, but not far from the first was a second.
Interesting... could this be the start of a new zone? Or perhaps it's the
portation to Plane of Power? Anyone have an idea?  It grabbed my attention
for just a short bit and was curios if anyone knew about them...

Thanks,
Oogamok
