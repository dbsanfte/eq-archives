Personally, I think it was a stealth nerf (actually, probably an
inadvertant nerf, but it's much more fun to accuse SOE of being
mean than to acknowledge that they're wrestling with hundreds of
thousands of lines of poorly understood legacy code).  I used it
successfully for a while with my Paladin.  Was playing a caster
for a time, several patches later I was back on Kaev and got the
same result you did.  It appears that mezzed mobs no longer show
their current target.

An opinion grounded in current reality.

Does Kick stun more frequently from behind the way Bash does?  Bash
rarely stuns form the front against mobs close to or above my level,
but from behind it is much better.  If I'm using a shield I always
try to break stun with a Bash from behind (note the word "try", I'm
a Paladin so even with level capped skills and +ATK buffs I am still
the WhiffMaster[tm], not much more embarrasing than to miss a mezzed
mob half-a-dozen times with your spiffy WMBS).

Actually, one stun on a mezzed mob is usually good enough unless:
there is a healer who just used a really big heal _sitting_ nearby,
or someone (Shaman/Enchanter) decided to debuff the snot out of the
mob while it was mezzed.

Hint to debuffers:  if you're gonna drop 2 or 3 high agro debuffs
on a mezzed mob, finish up with a Root cast the moment you see your
MT giving the mob the evil eye, trashing the mob's MR won't help an
interrupted root to land.  Or, if your MT is a Paladin, at least
mention what you're doing in guildchat so he can Root the mob himself.

Hint to all you impatient WARs out there:  If the Paladin's stun
lands you will see the mob's stun animation (most are very obvious).
If you wait at least that long before jumping the gun it's a lot
less likely you'll have a half-dead Enchanter screaming at you to
wait for the Paladin to break mez.  It's worth noting that either
they've stealth nerfed resisted stun agro or I was wrong about it
before.  There definitely seems to be less agro from resisted stuns
than there is when a stun sticks, which is why I suggest keying off
the stun animation if you're trying to hurry the Paladin along but
still want your Enchanter to live through the mission.
