Except for that you logged into it from your computer at home, or your
computer at work or wherever... with the same IP as your normal
account, or at a location that can be correlated to you. The
connection between you and the "anonymous" account is already in their
database.

Now, from what I hear, you have to REALLY screw up for them to ban
related accounts, but just to let you know, if they wanted to they
already know.

(By the way I work at an ISP and we track people down like this from
time to time when we get a court order. If we have the IP in our
network and an exact time, we can always tell you where the connection
came from. And I bet you SOE is storing the IPs that people log in
from.)
