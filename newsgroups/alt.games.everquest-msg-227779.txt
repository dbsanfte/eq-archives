I am currently a lvl 56 bard.  I been working on a couple of aa's through my
technique called octa-kiting :)    the venti flys in PoD.  Since I don't
think I can charm any other mobs in the other planes, what lvl can i
continue to charm to get xp to make it worth it.  Should I still be charming
here till I get the next charm song at lvl 64 or are the lvls of the flies
will be too low by then?  Also i hear of bards taken down Halls of Honor and
AE up to 40 mobs at once?  Is that true and what AE song are they using?
Thanks for any help
