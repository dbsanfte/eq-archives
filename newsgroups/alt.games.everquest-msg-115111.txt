It will.  My 57 Paladin has a hotkey just like that, and it
works fine.

He also has one like:

   /doability <LOH ability #>
   /gsay LAYING HANDS on %T

This does a Lay Hands on my current target (usually a groupmate),
and then informs the group that it has been done (so that the
Cleric can abort an incoming CHeal, and/or everyone can cancel
their heart attacks).
