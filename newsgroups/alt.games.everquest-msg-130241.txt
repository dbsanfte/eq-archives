We usually combine this with a farm of the scripted event here.  2-3 groups
of 50-somethings can have mostly nonstop fun here, and all the corroded plate
(most of the drops here are plate as opposed to arena) keeps all the plate-
wearers happy.

The mobs that drop the blood are easy compared to the mobs at the end of the
scripted event.  2 groups of low-50s should be sufficient to just take out
the Iceshards, however without running the script they'd get awful bored
between respawns if you had to wait for a second round.

Can't mez giants, so having charm available is useful to deal with adds.
Watch for gating mobs too.  You'll probably get double-pulls so have a ST
ready to tank the add until you can get it charmed or otherwise CCed.
