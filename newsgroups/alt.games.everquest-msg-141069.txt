Heh...I'm with the poster who mentioned earlier that he/she thought
reports of how this game got in the summer were greatly exaggerated.
I did as well, as I did not start the game until last August, and
spent a couple months really just getting my feet wet.  However, I do
now note an INORDINATE number of morons.  I usually manage to ignore
'em.  One odd thing I HAVE noticed...I took a stroll through OT the
other day. Amazingly quiet.  Very little /shout of any kind.  I spent
about half an hour there.  Where have the 30-40 idiot-types got to?
