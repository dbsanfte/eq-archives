I'm going for the black outfit look for my L39 High Elf female mage. I have
a Blackened Crystaline Robe and want the rest of my accessories to match,
including the scrunchie holding my ponytail. I understand that the color of
leggings affects the color of the scrunchie.

So, what should I get for Legs, Feet and Hands that doesn't cost a fortune,
doesn't require a 30 hour camp, but does have a visable black graphic?

Thanks in advance for any suggestions.
