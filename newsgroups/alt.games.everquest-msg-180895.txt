Is it just me, or has anyone else noticed that it is a *major* bear to come 
up with a name for a new character that will not be rejected? It might help  
somewhat if the actual policy for reusing names was fully understood. Can 
you delete a character and reuse the name as often as you want, pending 
normal server synchronization and such? Who knows? I have done so 
successfully for the first re-roll, but never a second. Also, I don't think 
I was ever successful when re-rolling as a different race. How about across 
servers? Is there any relation between named on different servers? It seems 
that I can never, no matter how unusual a name might be, use it again on a 
different server - having tried it a couple of times anyway.

I have spoken with guides who don't now naming policies any better than I 
do. By that, I mean that I have been told that I can reuse a name given the 
proper synch time, only to *never* be able to use it again.

I'm rambling. I know. I was just being curious out loud for a moment.
