Most of the quest looks like I can do it easily at level 51+.

I did the Lord Bergurgle camp last night with no problem. 51 was actually
the perfect level. The PHs were nice easy light blues. After about an hour
and a half Bergurgle popped as a dark blue who was only mildly challenging.
When I'm questing, I'll take the easy road any day. It took me a while to
figure out how to camp it though.

After that I killed Shmendrik and the Spirit. Now I've got a group of
youngsters that I'm PLing as we camp the Throne Room.

All of the other spawns look like no problem. In fact SolA is the only TLC
problem as far as I can tell.
