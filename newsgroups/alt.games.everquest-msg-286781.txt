You attribute me with far too much intelligence.

No, you gave up the position of being right when you started saying the 
same thing over and over despite the fact that this forum isn't the 
place to get those issues fixed.

Indeed and it doesn't matter how anyone else feels.

Strictly, not true.  I suspect that if enough people brought pressure in 
the correct location, it would get fixed or looked into.  I believe that 
your fruitless and futile venting in the wrong location will achieve 
nothing, in that we both agree.

And in the real world, those of us who work for large corporations 
understand how they got to this position, and have decided that 
actually, it doesn't really make any difference to me day-to-day, since 
I know when they're patching, and I know what status the patch is at.
