Look back at my numbers, she averaged 10 seconds, with slightly
over half the procs coming after 2 to 4 seconds and enough of
rest being much longer to drag the average down to 10 seconds.
Amazingly enough, that 10 second average is what you got.  :)

I am curious, looking at the proc damage (noticed values ranging
88 to 111), how the Sun Revenants con to your character?  Against
these mobs, at least, the proc looks to be worth ca. 10 DPS to you.
It'd be worth even more against lower level or less resistant mobs,
dunno the max damage for the proc so hard to guess how much more.

If there was an otherwise decent weapon that offerred that sort of
proc performance to a Warrior the competition for the spawn would
make the old Ragefire FCFS races look like teletubby conventions.
To give you an idea what a difference 10DPS would make, Davian
(Warlord) posted ca. 40 DPS with epic, a little more with his post-
epic weapon.  Give a Warlord a 10%-15% boost in damage (looks like
no boost in proc rate for haste, Cleric I grouped with was hasted
and got same rate is you) in the form of a proc which (presumably)
has some agro value and he's gonna be a happier tanker.
