Well Gore isnt up that often anyway, and even when she is, the zone is
large enough that you can often just run blindly through the snowy area
and not agro her because you just won't run in to her.  I have hunted
in Dreadlands with my main, all of my alts, as well as run through for
whatever reason.  I have tried soloing her a few times.  I have been in
several raids and groups to kill her.  She is always in the same place:
in the snow, over near or past the giant fort before you even get her
on ranger track.  I have never been worried about getting agro while on
a lower level character.

You would have to purposefully pull her to KC or one of the other
zones.  If you can't out-run her you won't live long enough to run her
all the way to a zone.  And if you are trying to outrun her, you will
get far enough away that she will stop chasing you, long before you get
near a zoneline.  The only reason to see her down in the regular
hunting grounds is because some jackass tried to solo her but didn't
want to risk death, so he pulled her to a zone before attacking.  The
pull would literally take 5 minutes.
