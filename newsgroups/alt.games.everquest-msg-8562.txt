yes,

see my other post but camping is a sensible compromise.
I didnt relly think of it tbh.
In future I wont offer to share but if the other guy asks then i will be
either compelled to agree (as its the decebt thing to do) or let him have it
on his own if the spawn aint worth sharing.

in the hermit case with me, it wasnt worth sharing 33% of a blue bubble aint
good enough.

thanks for responding
