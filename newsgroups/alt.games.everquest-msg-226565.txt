Paladins are great pullers, actually, thanks to Pacify.  I've probably had
more Paladin and Cleric pullers in LDON than any other class.  In LDON, I'd
usually rather have a Paladin pulling than a Monk--more controlled pulls,
more efficient (no waiting 30 seconds three times over for the monk to lose
agro), less risk to the puller.  Just my .02.
