The game is not designed to work that way, you are supposed to play only 
online connected to the SOE servers.

There doesn't seem to be any casual way to do it, either.

I -have- heard though, that there are people doing exactly this, perhaps 
in korea, and even that on some of those servers, things like level caps 
have been moved so you have level 70 characters running around.

However, I don't know anyone doing this, not even in the traditional "my 
dog does this by using X, but of course since its illegal I personally 
would never" sense.  All I can do is repeat some vague rumors I've heard 
over the years.

Splendid
