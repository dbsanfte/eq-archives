If you want to solo, you should know your AE's as well.

Look in the spell description.

If it says "...causing x damage to several creatures in the vicinity of your
target", it will hit you if you're close.  These are called targetted ae's,
and will be your staple of quad kiting.  They will hit a max of 4 mobs in
close range of each other. Names are the Pillar of ______ and Column of
____ lines.

If it says "...dealing x damage to all nearby creatures", it will not hurt
you.  These are called PBAE spells.. they will damage ALL mobs that are
close to you.  If you have 75 mobs piled on top of you, you will hit them
all.  These spells are only useful when farming really low green mobs, or if
you are in an AE group.

If you ever get in an ae group, holy crap it's fun.  You need 2 enchanters,
3 wizards, then maybe a healer.  Someone pulls a massive train back onto the
group, and the enchanters start chain stunning with their PBAE stun line.
Wizards then start chain casting their best PBAE nuke until all mobs are
dead - bingo you get xp for 25 mobs at the same time.  Tough to find people
with the balls and skills to do this nowadays though.

Have fun and be safe,
