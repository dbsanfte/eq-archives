(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>In the patch message they say that harder mobs will give more exp
>(yippie!)  But also that lower level ones will give less (BOO!!! BIG
>BOO!!!).  Does anyone have the breakdown on what that means?  Do all
>blue mobs now give 50% of the exp they used to or something like that?
> Will they add additional blue colors to indicate the experience
>penalty of the mob?  Ugh.  I hope they re-evaluate this.

In all honesty I have yet to notice any real difference in medium and
low dark blue experience. If its less, its not less by much.
