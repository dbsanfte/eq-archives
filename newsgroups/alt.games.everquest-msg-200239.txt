I had some issues that were similar in the past.  I had read that you
did delete your ini file, but was wondering are you using any custom
UI? if so, delete any ini files (better yet just copy em to a seperate
directory incase you want something back), and ensure you are not
loading up a custom UI. Also delete any texture cache files ( I think
they are *.txc or some such). and of course when patching have it do a
complete file check.  
I know your a veteran of EQ, so these suggestions may have already
been done, but just trying to help out.
