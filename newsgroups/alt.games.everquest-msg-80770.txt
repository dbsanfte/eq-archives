    Given when I first noticed it, I imagine the following happened:
originally, there was no Temple of Sol Ro. It was an optional zone, like The
Warrens. So to put a zone line there, they may have added a teleport
pad-area there on the floor. You can test this, in a way - jump across the
fuscia part, and when you hit where the "zone" is it's like you hit an
invisible wall. You don't zone until you fall down onto the fuscia area. To
cover what they did, they likely patched over the area with a texture that
was similar to, but not the same as, the original texture for the tunnel.

    Enter SoL and the new, improved textures for old-world zones.

    If they, by accident, deleted the texture they used to cover the
teleport pad, you'd be able to see it again. And it was after SoL came out
that people first started seeing that thing.
