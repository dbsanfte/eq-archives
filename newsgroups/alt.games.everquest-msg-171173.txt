lol... that's nothing.  Grouped with a bard once and watched him kite about
30 shrooms in Dawnshroud, just for the entertainment of the group... it was
pretty funny watching a mass of 30 shrooms bouncing around after him,
looking all pissed off and dangerous, with him just trotting around in a
circle and them dropping off dead one by one :)  After the first one he went
out and got about 50 of them, then had us run around behind him picking off
the ones that started to run.  That was fun.  Not really all that great as
far as exp and loot, but fun :)
