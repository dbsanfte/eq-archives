You won't be a shaman anyway, AA or not.  Ding 51 you get a title.

Progress through your 50's, and then finally at 60 you'll be an Oracle
(third title).    Ding 65 and you'll get a new title yet again.

AA titles don't show up on a "who", they just appear above your name (which
can be turned off)..
