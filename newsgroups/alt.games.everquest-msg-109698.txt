If you try to create immediately again after deleting you won't generally
get the name since it still locked by your previous char.
So you will have to chance it the no-one else thinks of it and snatch it
until you come back to recreate. Not sure when names are flushed,
if it is after a certain number of hours or if a server down is needed.
