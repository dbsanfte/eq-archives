Note that you will *also* have to go through Skyshrine.  I don't
believe it is possible to be non-KOS in Kael *and* Skyshrine at the
same time, so no matter what you do, you are going to have to travel
at least once through a KOS city.

OK, that's not quite true.  You could do this:

1. Kill Coldain to get Kael faction up.
2. Go through Kael and bind near the WL zone.
3. Kill in Kael to fix Coldain faction and get Skyshrine up.
4. Go through Skyshrine.

I can't think of any reason to do that, though, except maybe just to
say you did it. :-)

The normal procedure is to go through Kael invis, then go pick up a
tooth in the WL dragon circle, so that in the future you can get ports
to WL and bypass Kael.
