I remember a few years ago, my parents bought a Packard Bell system while I
was away at university.  When I came home for the summer, the
soundcard/modem thing was the first to go.  I later plonked the thing into
an old 486-33, and sold the system to a cow-orker of mine.   The next thing
to be upgraded was the RAM.  It was a P100, and only came with 8 megs.

Let's say that I now have little respect for Packard Bell computers these
days.  Dell, on the other hand...  <drooling over the new Dell server that
just went in at his father's office>
