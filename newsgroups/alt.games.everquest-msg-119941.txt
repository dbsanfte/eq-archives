All good zones.  I'd throw in my fave zone Stonebrunt too.  Lots of room
there, just gotta watch out for wandering adds.

On Luclin you can go to Dawnshroud and fear kite the zelniaks.  Just don't
stay near the Netherbian Lair zone unless you like being run over by trains.
The little humanoid creatures in that zone (can't remember thier names) have
a faction hit on them, but that's only a problem if you are counting on
walking past them kiting a zelniak and not getting jumped by them.  I'd camp
out near the entrance to Sanctus.  Don't go after the wolves unless you have
a group/tank with you, they have a ton of HP.  Watch out for the bugs,
they'll blind you.

Have fun
