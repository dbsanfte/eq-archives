Went out and killed Sev yesterday, I arrived a bit late and there
was another guild growing presence in the zone, so we rushed
things a bit.  I hadn't been told who the MA/SA were (I'm sure
most people did know) yet so I didn't have him locked on my tab
setup.  Thru the entire fight, I had serious troubles getting him
targetted; whenever I tried to get Sev up to assist I instead
picked up Sev's pet, and assisting him got me... me.  Dang pet
was trying to chew my arm off!  At any rate, we made it thru
fairly easily, so it wasn't really all that big a deal that I
only landed one heal on the MA the whole fight, but it sure could
have sucked.

Then I went in on a raid in PoN.  Three groups, raid window up, I
already have color codes set up so I can at a glance see all the
sponges (red) clerics (green) and mezzers (yellow)  I can click
on any name to check hp totals or to supply requested buffs, and
I have a very good idea  what the whole raid structure is just
from reading the group layouts, with everyone having their class
and level displayed.

I was grouped with MA, SA, and Puller, which seems silly, but
then again I could see their HP totals constantly, and also had a
shaman in group to help heal.  Other than the shaman my entire
group was melee, and the same was true of the other cleric (she
had the main enchanter and 4 melee), while the support staff were
grouped with a druid.  Sadly the second chanter kept having to
ask me for heals, and the druid kept dying, but thats not a fault
of the raid structure, druid seemed to be under the impression he
was there for nuking only.

I'll keep having to do raids without the raid window, but every
taste I get of it makes other raiding experience seem more
irritating.
