Along with a number of people in our guild, I'm also fervently hoping
that this "switch" will be in place and available to *ALL* players, not
just ones who's names would suddenly be in violation. I play a nasty,

IMO, from a roleplaying perspective, be about the same level as suddenly
haveing me wear a dress and ballet slippers.
