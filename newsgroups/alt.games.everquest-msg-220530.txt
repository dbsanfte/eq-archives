I agree that the tolands bracer really should be bagged, there's
plenty of nice bracers out there for under 1500p. I do kinda like the
vambraces though, Even though the damge isn't much, I use them to pull
while soloing; click vambraces, get in a cast of that 39 lvl DD
(flaming arrow?) before the mob gets to me and I've done over 250pts
of damage before ever getting hit. Seems like a lot to give up for
what I think is 25 extra HP from from the grey flesh sleeves.

I'd forgotten about the helm of the tracker, don't recall how good it
is compared to something like darkmail but I can always get a few
people together to hit Kael, just for old time's sake. Too many Kael
Arena trips as a low 50s shaman where the Protectors of Zek used to
own my ass, I'll go out of my way now for payback. Who cares that the
loot and exp there is meaningless <g>.

Anyone been back to CT since the last revamp? Unless they raised the
spawn rate on the named it's probably not worth dragging people down
there. I probably spent over 30 hours (2 different camps) downstairs
in CT trying to get friends the FT3 booties and bard clicky boots,
never saw either one drop.

Lizard tempers are sitting in the bank <g>.

High on my list of things to camp, soloable so probably not worth
spending money on.

Puppet strings drop in PoM? We took a full group there last week
(after the revamp) and the place didn't really impress me.

I'm almost convinced to try for swiftwind now, I haven't been back to
the Hole since the last revamp but we spent a lot of time there
pre-60. Lots of people I know enjoy the place so getting a group up
for there isn't a problem.

Thanks for a lot of useful advice.
