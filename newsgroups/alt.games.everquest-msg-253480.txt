I agree, obviously is going a bit far.  But in general, if they take it 
down with 5 minutes notice, it isn't the hamster dying.  Dead hamsters 
tend to result in an immediate 'you have been disconnected'.  So if they 
were warned, it might be -nearly- obvious it was some kind of an exploit 
issue.  Especially since the one server going down is FV, which is a 
special rules server, so there might be an exploit involving one of those 
special rules... like, them implementing TLC backward this week, so the 
magic/lore items -automatically- drop if you -are- the right level for 
it... :)
