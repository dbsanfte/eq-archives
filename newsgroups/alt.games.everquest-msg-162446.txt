If you can swear with hand on heart that ALL you will ever do is solo...
then go fo Iksar. Regen + Darkpact = free mana

Twink gear?
Black sapphire earrings and Jade rings + bracers... HP + mana on all of
them... and for a Necro, that's like double mana! :o)

After you've got some nice focus gear (Affliction Efficiency, Extended
Afliction, Reanimation Efficiency) go for mana, HP and STA before you go for
Int... not the traditional route for casters, but it'll give your Necro much
more flexibility to have high HP you can either use to tank for a while, or
to convert to mana when needed :o)
