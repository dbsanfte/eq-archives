 I believe somebody here said you need to have your various harvest
scores about 42ish to harvest there (there being what they call a tier
2 zone). Yes it is real annoying since I hit 9 artisan before I left
n00b isle, harvesting like crazy there only to discover I still had 15
more points to go before I could finish the quest in qeynos so I could
start leveling again and resources are scare and over hunted. However
I did read that respawn time on resources were shorten. 

Seems like an abnormal leap between tier 1 and 2 unless it was meant
to be a planned time sink on Sony's part.
