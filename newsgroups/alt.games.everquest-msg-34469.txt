Hey all,

Something happened over the weekend that really irked me and illustrates my
EQ pet peeve:

I was helping a Paladin friend track Snow Griffins in EW for the Shawl
quest. We would go kill one, then rest on the bridge till another popped. I
kept checking radar and noticed an odd named MOB I'd never seen before. I
told him I was going to check it out and took off running. As I'm running I
see an /ooc 'Can someone heal me at bridge? I'm DoTed'. I'm pretty far from
bridge at this point (and really wanted to see who this MOB was) so I keep
running.

Finally I see a named Orc being kited by a bard. I figure OK, he's taken
I'll look it up later. I better go help this guy at the bridge. I turn
around and head back, get to bridge and see someone being trained by a Snow
Griffin and a Dire Wolf - I run up and cast snare on the MOBs but the PC has
zoned. I kill them anyway and sit down.

Next thing I see is an /ooc 'To the Druids that sat and watched me get my
ass kicked so they could get 'NAMED MOB' /rude' " . Apparently the Bard that
was kiting the Named was the same one shouting for a heal at the bridge.

It was a big misunderstanding - I didn't pay attention to the name of the PC
/OOCing, and when you're tracking something, stuff scrolls up pretty fast. I
would have healed the Bard if I'd known he was the one who needed healing
(BTW when I saw him kiting he was running AWAY from the bridge).

My main issue was that he /OOCed the zone without even talking to me first -
and no, I didn't kill the Named.

The second issue is, who says it's my job to heal you anyway? I died four
times on Sunday without asking for heals from nearby PC's. They didn't get
me into trouble. I got myself into trouble.

So to the brave and valiant 'Champions of Marr' bozo who can't take care of
themselves:

/em hands %T a copy of Super Mario World << This is more your speed.
