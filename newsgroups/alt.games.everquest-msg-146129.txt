That's what the consensus in America is.  It's fucking ridiculous, the Jews
are nothing special, no better then any other race, yet for some reason they
deserve some kind of special protection?  I don't think so, and it's idiotic
to think that they deserve anymore then any other person.  I'm willing to
bet that everyone of these people that are coming down on this guy are the
same people that laugh at racist jokes when they're with their friends; as
long as they are black, Mexican, Italian, Irish or Hindu racist jokes, cause
we wouldn't want to offend the perfect Jews, would we?
