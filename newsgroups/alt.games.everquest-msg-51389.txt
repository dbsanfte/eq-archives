At L52, don't bother :)

Pyzjn is a major pain to camp, rare spawn with multiple PHs (maybe) and
several spawn points (definately) and the GBS is a rare drop to boot. If you
check out the posts on http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/ you'll see plenty
of theories on spawn times/ways to get her to spawn/etc, but basically
you're looking at a 30+ hour camp. Go camp IGs instead and just buy a GBS if
you really want one, they go for 6-8Kpp on MT. Even better, get some friends
together and go camp the Dread Widow in DL for the Drachnid Thyxl, or do the
Phenocryst's Focus quest that starts in Thurgadin.

Hadden (the fishbone ear-ring guy) is about a 5 1/2 hour spawn time and he
always pops in the same place. He doesn't always drop the ear-ring though,
and he is usually heavily camped (although not always visibly - people bind
there and gate in when he is going to spawn soon). Unless you have a lot of
free time on your hands and can stand the boredom of just sitting there
waiting for him (in which case people may or may not respect your camp),
either just buy the ear-ring or bind there and try to get him when the
servers come up after patch.
