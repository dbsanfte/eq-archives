Do whatever you feel most comfortable with.

Never let anyone tell you what to do.

Standards, traditions, rules (even manners, politeness and courtesy) are all
subjective. If you aren't causing someone physical injury or severe mental
trauma, you're within your rights.

I don't like seeing 'u' instead of 'you' and 'ne1' instead of 'anyone', but
I don't try and change the way individuals do things. To be honest I fear
conformity and compromise.

Personally, I like top-posting (I even like Microsoft Outlook as a simple
mail/news client), but I'll read any post that has relevant information.
