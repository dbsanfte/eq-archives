I guess my next question would be..  then wtf is the point of the test
server?

One of the first things I learnt when i first started working as a
programmer was never make assumptions.. and expect the unexpected. (My old
boss had some weird maths analogy to prove the point, but Im damned if I
remember it now)

Im quite sure even a 5 minute "log in and run about" would have highlited
these MASSIVE glaring problems.  There really is no excuse for bugs like
what they introduced ever making a live server. Ever.
