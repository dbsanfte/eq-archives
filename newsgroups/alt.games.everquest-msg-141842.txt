I am buying one. From a players perspective its usefulness is null. Its only
good for showing your friends about EQ. And also for the lore.

Stop whining peeps, its not a spoiler. If you want a spoiler goto
eqatlas.com. This is for people more interested with the lore etc and its
trying its best to keep the atlas as ingame/in character as possible.

Loc is not a officially supported component of the gameplay. Thats why quest
npc's never tell you mob x is at loc y. Loc was a tool in beta that was
never removed due to player outcry.
