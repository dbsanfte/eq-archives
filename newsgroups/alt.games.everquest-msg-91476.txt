It only happens when you a) look at your inventory in 640x480 mode,
and b) have the sky turned on.

Go to higher resolution (which lets you use the nifty "transparent
inventory" overlay), or turn off the sky, or both.

Even when you do get it and the menus/text windows go black (actually,
slate gray on one of my systems with an ATI), you can fix it by
going back into inventory and then out again (press "i", then "i"),
which will give you a 50-50 chance of having the problem clear
itself (the other half the time it'll be gray again -- it all
depends on when in the flicker cycle you happen to drop back out
of the inventory).

Finally, Verant is working specifically on this problem, and has
a possible fix up on the Test server.  They have asked people with
ATI cards to try it and see if it cures their flicker problem.
The early word is, "for some ATI cards yes, for some no."  Verant
then announced that they'll keep digging until they figure out how
to eliminate it entirely.

So it may be premature for you to buy a new video card yet.
