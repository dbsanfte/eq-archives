Hi All;

I've just recently started paying attention to the tribute/favor system of
GoD.  Every now an then I'd throw some junk in and get a few points. Then,
for the first time, I turned on FT5 giving me a noticeable return on mana
during a small raid. As I understand it, if the item you turn in is usable
by your class you will get more points for it.

Last night I had about an hour or so to kill, so I thought I would go "junk
hunting". I could not remember the areas that would drop "cleric" stuff.
Doing an Alla search only brings up about a million hits.  Grinding up
through the levels, I would loot, sell and pay little attention to what and
who, items I found were for.

So, I thought I would ask you all for a few suggestions of where a 65 Cleric
with average gear could solo farm cleric type items to turn in for tribute.
Not things I would have to camp, just general areas to blast through when I
have spare time.

Thanks all in advance for your time and suggestions.

Doctorzoid
65 Cleric
