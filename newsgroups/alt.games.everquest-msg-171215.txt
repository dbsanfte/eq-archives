Hmm... on second thought, I think I should take back something I said
here... freedom of speech would indicate that prayer in public places should
be acceptable.  However, loud and obtrusive demonstrations (such as a public
sermon) I don't think are appropriate, except in places where such things
are expected, like public forums and "soapboxes".  Disturbance of the peace
(except in demonstrations where a political or public awareness goal is
being sought -- not, however, a conversion or proselytization goal) applies
to religion as well as to anything else.  This is my personal opinion.  I'm
aware that this is debatable, so I'm not going to argue that anyone who
disagrees with me is wrong, just that I don't agree.  However, under no
circumstances is religious demonstration or prayer acceptable in situations
where the onlookers have no choice but to be there.  Like school, for
example.
