And you're a dumb-ass. While Ben may have come off a bit abrasive in this 
monologue (Ben? Abrasive? Naaaw. :P), it was surely more in the interest 
of making a point rather than a personal attack on you or anyone else. 
Frankly, whereas it does occasionally border on a general attack on 
anyone who might at some point find themselves acting in certain manners 
he was criticizing, it is nonetheless very good and useful information. I 
wish all players could read it at some point.

I don't see why you take it so personally, unless you see yourself too 
often having been on the stupid side of his diatribe and just can't 
accept it.

I honestly cannot fathom why anyone would put so much effort into 
criticizing someone who is speaking the truth. You've lost any debate in 
this instance before it's even begun.
