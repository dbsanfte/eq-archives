Bah, don't warrant post?  Its not as though AGE is wasting a lot of 
bandwidth these days, as far as I can tell, ANY excuse for a post would 
be to the good!

Firiona  Vie.... is the funny "one character per account, no "no drop" 
etc. server right?  No, thats my 65 Mage.  Course thats within group 
levels of 56, if there are places where I can get exp and you don't both 
vanish with one errant blow.

I don't even really know which servers I have characters on, because as 
I understand it, they did a bunch of mergers.  That actually happened 
before I restarted and requit... I just started a clean character from 
scratch and didn't look into the old ones!

Lance
Splendid One, gnomish 65 mage, Firiona Vie (or whatever that merged with)
