] That reminds me of a very interesting "sculpture" of which I once had a

I saw, about 2 months ago, the main bank in pok, on Zebuzoruk
server, a large bear corpse at each front corner. Up on the roof.
Someone mentioned in /ooc that it appeared that the main bank had
done some remodeling adding bear statues to the facade.
