Chris,

You're about to reach a very tough level, well *I* found it tough, level 
36. It kept me there for a few months (I quit about a month in) - 
couldn't find a group... Finally got LDoN and got my ass through it.

If you find trouble at that point- its worth it to push through it. 
You'll get the right stuff!

Good luck!

Matt
