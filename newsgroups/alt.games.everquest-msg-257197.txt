Since, I spent most of the day grouping (mostly LDoNs) and near the
end of the evening couldn't find enough people to do one of the more
out of the way dungeons (like Old Seb, Veksar, etc...) that I don't
get much chance to play in, I decided to do some sightseeing and
thrill seeking.

A while back I had decided that I would cliff dive off of the aqueduct
in Trak's Teeth, but couldn't find a way up. So since I had nothing
better to do I decided to find a way up there. I finally managed to do
so, and did do some cliff diving off the Aqueduct. Much fun.

(Speaking of thrill seeking, jumping off the top floor of the Cleric
guild in Freeport into the pond on the bottom is a lot of fun too.)

Then moved on to Luclin, to go sightseeing in some zones I haven't
been to yet. (There are still a few left, believe it or not.) I wander
around Sanctus Seru, and decide to find a way on top of the arena.
Which I manage to do. (Also deciding that starting tomorrow, I'm
gonna' start hunting guards there. Looks like a great place to do it.)

(I hear that some people can actually make it to the top of the FV
statue in FV. No idea how though.)

What are your favorite hard to reach places that the Devs didn't want
you getting to?

What are highest things you can jump off of an survive? (Usually
because there is water at the bottom.)

Anyone ever manage to survive a jump to the bottom of the Hole?
