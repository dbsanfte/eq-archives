People don't always respect your rights.  When you put yourself in a
situation where you are associating with such people, and then they indeed
to violate your rights, you bear part of the blame.

For example, if you wished, you have the *right* to go to South Central Los
Angeles alone, on a dark night, dressed in KKK clothing, and distribute
White Supremacy literature.  That doesn't give anyone the right to beat the
living crap out of you.  However, anyone with an IQ above 10 would know that 
to actually try to do this will result in said beating (or much worse), and
so if they stupidly do go down to South Central and try it, I'm not going to
think of them as an innocent victim.
