  After the first time I did a /shout in the zone to see if it happened
to anyone else.  Got two replies "yes".  It is rare, which is why it's
so hard to find, and so easy to believe it isn't real.  It must be
somehow configuration-related if many people have never had it.
It's not video-related, because I have played with 3 different
cards and it's happened on all of them.  I can go weeks with nothing
happening, then BOOM.  It nearly always happens on dialup, and
in stormy weather.  I think it is a communications bug.  I posted
a message on the Technical Help forum and they want DXDIAG info,
of course.  I have no video or sound problems.  The chances that
it is a directX issue is minimal (I am a game programmer, BTW).

  I have been just shrugging it off as something that happens,
and others have done this too I think, but now I'm energized to
try and get it fixed.

  Done both of those, of course.  No effect.  After the first time
I assumed it was solved, but alas, no.

  I don't play at work :).  I do however travel on the road a
bit and when at home I play on cable, on the road (Yes, I take my
PC with me for EQ alone!) I'm forced to dial-up.

  That's Katha Firespinner, I know about her, she stopped my brief
begging career (what fool told me it was the way to make money?) by
insulting and then killing me at level 8.  Don't beg from her is
my advice :)  I do still buy from her though :)
