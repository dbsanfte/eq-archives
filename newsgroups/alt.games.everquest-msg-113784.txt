I honestly think that Verant should impliment a new class: Fallen Paladin.
KoS to every Paladin guild, loss of all casting ability (because you have
shamed your deity), and unable to wear any paladin specific items.  Any time
a CS rep sees a paladin begging, they would immediately have their class
changed to this.
