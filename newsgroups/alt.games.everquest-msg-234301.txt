Voodoo 4 4500.  Looking around on voodoofiles.com I found some DX8.1
drivers for Win 98SE, but the only 9,0 ones i saw (I think, my German
sucks) were for WinXP.

Anyhoo, I wasn't going to upgrade the videocard until I upgrade the
rest of my (crappy) computer, and that's still a couple months down
the road...sigh.
