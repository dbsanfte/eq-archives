Yes, I have a history of that in this newsgroup don't I.

Oh wait, actually I have a history of knowing enough about what I post to
usually shut you up.

This time I give the hint.  Those with *any* intelligence (no, I'm not
including you in that list DT) will be able to run with that and figure out
exactly what I figured out.  But I'm not gonna make it easy, because Sony
*has* to have a way to drop Bazaar traders.  It has little or nothing to do
with bandwidth, and all to do with keeping customers paying a monthly fee. 
Since they *have* to have a way to drop Bazaar traders, they *will*
implement another method when this one gets known by enough people that the
problem they are preventing is no longer being prevented.
