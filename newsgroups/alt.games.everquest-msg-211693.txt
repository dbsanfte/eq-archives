The old spell still costs a level 65 Spell Rune to get, too.

Hooray! A bunch of us just killed a big nasty and got a rune! Lets go turn
it into the Enchanter GM so we can get group haste and save her mana!

WTF? Illusion: Froglock?

No other class has a 1 in 3 chance of getting a SUPREMELY worthless spell.
It has absolutely ZERO benefit to the caster or those around them.

Apparently the Sony devs feel very strong about Froglocks and think we all do
as well. Which is why the enchanter I play often with will not be getting
the Guktan spell, even if we ever do finish her epic (3 pieces left!)
