Yes, several types--descriptive, proscriptive, etymological, etc.

Most of the "collegiate" varieties attempt to be descriptive, I think, or at 
least were back when I was more familiar with what was available.

Any dictionary is pretty much subjective, though.  My god, look what's 
happened here with one word--can you imagine the arguments that must take 
place amongst those charged with actually *creating* an entire dictionary, 
if *one* entry creates as much turmoil as this?
