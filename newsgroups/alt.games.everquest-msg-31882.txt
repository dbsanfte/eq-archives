OK< I suck.  Don't tell anyone.

I can't seem to get this right.

sit
camp
get hit, stand up, breaking camp.

DA
sit
camp
18 seconds of peace and quiet, then
get hit, stand up, breaking camp.

/q
come back dead

By some miracle, successfully camp out.
Come back, get jumped by mobs, die.

Since I've only successfully camped out
of a real trouble spot twice, I can't say
I have a large sample size to work with,
but both times I was supposedly in a safe
spot, and one of the two I had a FD
spotter, who I communicated with via
an alt.  The latter time, apparantly in
the time it took to log out as my alt and
back on as Bergh, some roamer showed
up.... so much for "safe."

I see most other clerics having similar problems,
but there are a couple I know who -regularly-
managed to camp out, camp back in, res
the raid and put us back in business in short order.
What are they doing that I'm not?

Only thing I can think of is, camp out the second
the overpull is observed.  Trouble with this is,
I can't really tell what the pull is all that well,
since I have all my "attacker hits" and so forth
messages turned off in a crowded raid situation.
I've tried relying on camping when the word is given,
but thats' always too late.  Also, I've been in plenty
of overpulls that were handleable... with me there.
Since I've blown a full bar of mana in CHeals and
Remedies during those fights (FM to OOM in one
easy lesson) I"m reasonably sure that if I -had-
camped out, I'd have been faced with resing everyone
when I got back.

SO help me out here.  What am I doing wrong, and
how can I remedy it?

Bergh
