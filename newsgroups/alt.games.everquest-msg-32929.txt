Oh my ghod, they made the SK epic drop off a mob? How horribly
broken is *that*? And how many SKs have lost their epic to a
ninjalooter?

I realize that every epic piece requires mob drops at some point,
but having the actual weapon itself drop sounds like a recipe for
disaster... If I were a shadow knight, I'd make damn sure the group
I was in had a high chance of getting the kill.
