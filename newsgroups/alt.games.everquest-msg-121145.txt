EQW technically isn't "allowed", with that huge Verant terms and
conditions...

But I would estimate that at least 50% of the entire EQ population uses EQW.

EQW doesn't make it easier to use macro/hack programs... shit like that
works already in full screen, so whats it solved? (id assume so anyway,
never as much as d/l'd one to know if it requires EQW or not)

EQW just makes it easier to be contactable (ICQ, AIM).. ability to surf the
web/check emails while playing.. or if your PC can handle it, allows you to
run 2 characters from the same computer...  is that really such a bad thing?

W2k allows you to restore the game if you alt+tab out anyway
