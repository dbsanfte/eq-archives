I have to agree because I don't see how you arrive at thinking that some of
the classes are overpowered.  Shamans for instance are very good soloers,
but at the high end they are a bit lacking on raids for a couple of reasons.
At high levels most people have maxed out stats and don't need shammy buffs.
Shamans healing ability is limited, slow generates high aggro, DoT's and
Nukes have high resist rate.  (very basic run-down)

As for Rogues being over powered I REALLY don't know how you got that one.
They are very tough to level and was my entry into the "hardest class to
play" thread.  They are highly dependent on other classes, can't solo worth
shit, have low HP and are easily eaten by light blues.

A lot of folks might say that Druids are overpowered as they are one of the
few classes that can solo multiple MOBs at a time, are easy to play and can
buff and make money gating even at low levels.

So what exactly is the criteria?

Damage output?
Ability to solo?
Usefullness outside of fighting?
Usefullness in raids?
Ability to make money through innate skills/spells?
Ability to make money through farming?
What about the availability of good gear and quests?  Do some classes get
more than others?
Oh and although not a biggie how about the ability to Trade Skill?
Non-WIS/INT classes are really at a disadvantage there.
Desirability in groups?  (out with the rogue in with the cleric)
