Nah. Still open for abuse, though not of the same kind. There are
several places where there could be multiple spawns that a party simply
could not kill to get past them to some other goal. Allowing them to
"perch" kill them one at a time would still likely be viewed as a
'sploit, even if they got no free xp or loot off the deal.
