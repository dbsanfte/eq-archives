Basically, I wanted to avoid whiners. :-)

"The Harmony nerf was great, because dr00ds have it too easy."

No thanks. We get enough of those in the nerf threads.

For the "good" improvements side, I thought it would
be nice to focus on the positive things for a change.
Regarding nerfs as positive would likely wind up in
repeats of the debates we've seen far too frequently.

For the "bad" improvements side (which was an
afterthought) I wanted to get some views on things that
were either designed to be good, but worked out as bad,
or *were* good, but were bad for other groups/classes.
