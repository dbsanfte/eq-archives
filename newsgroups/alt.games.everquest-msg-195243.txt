    The Aqua Goblins were also the source of endless petitions about camp
sharing and KS'ing. That's what will kill them. If the guards and nobles in
HHK suffer the same fate, it will be because of petitions from people trying
to do the hand-in quest that the Captain is being ganked on them.

    And the Aqua Goblins were stupidly, stupidly popular. Every vendor in
PoK had the drops from that camp on them at one point. Given that it was
only two camps, that was a sure sign that something was out of whack.
