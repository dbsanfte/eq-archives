You can single pull them at 60, not sure about 59.
Single pulled they should be ok if your good at channeling spells while 
being hit, and have decent gear. Pet is too weak to be useful.
Gonna be a ong painful grind tho.

Also the spiders you want are the crystalline model, and they spawn more 
upstairs.
"Ledge" is the ideal place to hunt for threads. (almost up the top)
