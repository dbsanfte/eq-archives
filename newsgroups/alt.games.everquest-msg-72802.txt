Beat me to it, Dan.  I've been having the problem and, like many here, was
convinced it was on my side.  Then, I heard about this problem.  The next
night, I had done a /who just a couple of seconds ago when I had a
micro-freeze.  Did another /who and someone had just entered.  This has also
been consistent with some low-traffic zones I've been in lately where I do a
/who now and then, and as soon as another hiccough occurs.
