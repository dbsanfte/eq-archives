}My children are also forced to go to said school, and adopt a secular

Is Secularity a religion now?

}Why does your children's right not to see offensive religious practices
}trump my children's right to observe their faith?  What of the muslim
}children who must pray at regular times?  Are they required to hold their
}prayers until the end of the school day?

Probably depends on the school policy, but it shouldn't.  In my mind, the 
proper procedure would be for them to be excused from class for this 
purpose, if necessary.

}Or, to take another look, why is it that my child can be indoctrinated into
}radical environmentalism, feminism, reverse-racism, anti-Americansim, while
}they can't practice their faith?

I must have missed the units on bra-burning, tree-spiking, and 
honkey-bashing.  I'm still trying to work out where you get the 
anti-American bit.  Surely, if it's being taught by American teachers, it 
must be something that at least some Americans stand for?

}Why is it that it's OK for a christian student to see to guys holding 
}hands,

Because there's nothing wrong with two guys holding hands.  If it bugs 
you, go stare at somebody else, ok?

}but it's not alright for a non-christian child to hear a prayer?  

It is alright for a non-Christian child to hear a prayer.  Provided they 
have license to go hear something else if it bugs them.

}All of these things happen in a place where my child is forced to attend.

Might I suggest private education, if it's that important to you?
