Nah, this year is fairly average.  You get a bunch of interesting
games in one week, nothing the next, just like usual.  Dungeon Siege
wasn't that good, but I must admit that I did play it for a while
before I went on to something else; I was hoping it would get better.
Haven't played NWN yet, but Warcraft 3 is good, though I'm not hooked
on it like I was with Starcraft (which I _did_ buy a copy of).  Heroes
of Might and Magic 4 was great.  C&C Renegade kicked ass.  Morrowind
would probably be good if I had a computer capable of running it.
Same with that US Army game that just came out.  And there are surely
a few other notable games from this year that I've forgotten.

And before anyone asks, yes, I'm perfectly aware that this is a
satire.

a good day on AGFF without JT bashing!
