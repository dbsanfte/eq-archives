Actually I am glad to have this discussion.  I have been pondering a second
game, but I am *definitely* addicted to the people, places, scenery, music,
ambiance etc. in EQ.  I loved carrying mail from Qeynos!  I really *don't* want
to get in a *shootem up* type game.
Since the COHers have always noted the OT in their subject line I have no
problem with it.
