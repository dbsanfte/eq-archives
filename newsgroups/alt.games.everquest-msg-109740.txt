Nor does the opposite assertion automatically obtain the property of
being truth.

No indeed. What qualifies as "evil" in my book is unaffected by
someone else's opinion. But that's the whole point - "good" and "evil"
are entirely subjective. They're different for every person, every
culture, every population. Sometimes radically different.

No, it is an act of open-mindedness. An act of recognizing that My Way
isn't the Only Way. And, in a big departure from my usual personality,
it is an act of not being arrogant. 

Unlike many people, I don't suffer from the flawed notion that what I
believe constitutes Universal Truth.

There are many definitions for the terms. They are all subject to a
specific point of view. The various definitions serve as a basis for
judgement all the time. For example, America has judged the pilots to
be terrorists. The Taliban judged them to be heroes. The differing
judgements resulted from differing definitions.

And in the context of the cultures doing the judging, and their points
of view, both judgements are correct.

If that's the case it should be easy enough to empirically prove the
fallacy in my position. I look forward to your attempt.

I'm asserting that "evil" is subjective. To date in this thread no one
has demonstrated otherwise.

Happily, I'm not seeking to impress you.
Cleverness is certainly more a virtue than foolishness. 
The difficulty in constructing an argument for the "one true
definition of evil" stems simply from there being no such thing.
