Probably even cheaper, as I wouldn't have to replace much. Assuming my
ASUS MB could be pushed to the appropriate clock speeds (is it just
me, or do MB manufacturers always seem to ignore the obvious fact that
the current fastest processor isn't the only speed they will need to
support), all I'd need would be a new CPU, the Video card (currently
GeF2), and another half-gig of ram.
