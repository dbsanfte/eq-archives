I would like to add here that people who have spent 200 hours on 
tradeskilling should also be able to make comparable gear. Then 
tradeskills would really mean something. Since at the moment it is 
easier to race to 65 and farm "plat" to buy better gear in the bazaar 
than can be made.

The only problem I can see with the tradeskill solution, is that it 
won't be based on skilling-up, but based on obtaining rare drops from 
rare mobs. These as usual will be "farmed" by high level people, thereby 
nullifying the skill based element.

Another alternative would be for NPCs to pay substantially more for 
items made by GM tradeskillers, to allow them to buy better stuff. 
However, this may excerbate the problems of mud-flation.
