I wanted to try RvR, I really did.  I was looking forward to it.

But dying at level 16 and losing a couple hours experience just to die again
to lose another couple hours just got to be too much.  Level 17 was looking
bleak and ALL I had to look forward to was RvR after I got another 5-15
levels?  Five to 15 levels similar to the pure hell 16 is?  With nothing to
show for it?

Sorry, no thanks...cool concept but I couldn't take the depression any more.
