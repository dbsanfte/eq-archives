Subject: Necromancer-usable shields and armor

Are there any Necromancer-usable shields that give Int and\or hit point bonuses
that aren't No Drop? My Necro (level 16) carries a Staff of Writhing and a
Harvester, but I want to get a shield to carry when I'm not engaging in melee
(which is often; when soloing I only fight up close if i'm hunting wolves,
pumas and bears for pelts, or skeletons for bone chips).

Also, are there any Necro-wearable helmets that I could reasonably trade a
Flayed Skin Cap (and a few pp...no more than 30) in for? I have a full set of
Flayed Skin (I think....unless there are gloves or shoulderpads), but I don't
like the look of the headpiece.

I wish they had completely changed the design of Flayed Skin, or at least the
coloring, when they redid the textures for SoL. (I wear a Blackened Crystalline
Robe instead of the tunic, if I know I won't be dealing with spellcasters in
combat)
