Those low level characters you see running around are probably alt's.
That means that said person has more then 1 character in the guild.
His main will be high enough to fullfill the minimum requirement of that guild, and his alts can be any level.

And yes, what all the other's said... Research a guild first... Joining a guild that openly advertises means that ANYONE can get into that guild. And you don't wanna be in a guild with just ANYONE, unless you like to hear/say the word "penis" in all
it's variations all day long.
