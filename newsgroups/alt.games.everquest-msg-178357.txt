Breed
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
Care if I'm old

I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
mind
Don't have a mind

Get way
Get way
Get way
Get way
Get way
Way from your home

I'm afraid
I'm afraid
I'm afraid
I'm afraid
Fraid, of a ghost

Even if you have
Even if you need
I don't mean to stare
We don't have to breed
We can plant a house
We can build a tree
I don't even care
We could have all three
