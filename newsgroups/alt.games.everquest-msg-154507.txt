I know, see, I put that comment right there!

Honestly, I know its off topic, but this is a prime example
of why top posting (and bottom posting for that matter)
is a piss poor way to do newsgroup posting.  I can't
tell if you read this part and agree, or think I honestly
missed it!

So what does your modification do if the warrior DOES
have a 1000 AC at level one?  I think I can see how
it should work, with diminishing returns falling off to both
sides of the "target" rather than off a set figure like 1000.
This would make a 1000 AC warrior tank better than
a 100 AC warrior, but not immeasurably so.

0 AC = full damage taken
Half "target AC" = 3/4ths damage taken
"target AC" = hafl damage taken
one and a half times "target AC" = quarter damage taken
double "target AC" = eighth damage taken
two and a half times "target AC" = sixteenth damage taken

and so forth.

Looking at this curve, I think I'm giving waaaay too much
importance to AC.  Returns aren't dropping off nearly quickly
enough when you tie things in to level like this.  A mob that
hits for 16 points at level ten (target AC 150) meets a level
one warrior in 375 AC gear, does only 1 point per blow.
Thats toooo good.

Lets see, how about

0 = full damage taken
half "target" = 3/4ths damage taken
"target" = half damage taken
double "target" = quarter damage taken
Quadruple "target" = eight damage taken
Octuple "target" = sixteenth damage taken
Hexideciple "target" = 1/32nd damge taken

Now your 1000 AC guy facing a level 10 mob
still takes less than a point out of each 16, but
at least the 375 AC guy is taking three or four
points when he gets hit.

What about a level 60 mob?  Say one that
hits for 400 points.  Your proposed target
is 900 AC.  Warrior with 1800 AC takes
100 point blows, ranger with 1200 AC takes
150 point blows, monk with 900 AC takes
200 point blows, wizard with 450 AC takes
300 point blows, and -some naked guy-
with zero AC takes the full 400 point blows.

Well, I have to say that I think 15 is too low,
target AC on a 60 mob should be at least 1000,
perhaps even higher... probably target AC
on a 50 mob should be 1000.  This would
mean target AC would be 20 per instead of
15 per.
