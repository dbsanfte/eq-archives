I agree that some of the quests are a royal pain and maybe even not
worth the trouble/time. However, is the armor you receive (and some of
it pretty good for a new player) not worth the trouble? I mean,
delivering mail from one town to the next gives an appropriate reward
- xp and some money - because it is effortless. Can you imagine if the
better newbie armor quests were that easy? *Everyone* would be running
around wearing the stuff. Some accomplishment that would be.

I think you just got *really* unlucky. I agree with the other posters
in that you should move on to other aspects of EQ that you do enjoy,
at least for a while. By the time you get back to it, you may have
some of the harder-to-get items simply from other endeavors.
