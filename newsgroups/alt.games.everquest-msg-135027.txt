That's the two steps back part.

Which is what you get for trying to think without learning how.

hehehe  Any *your* nation doesn't care a whit for what it can get?

Keep telling yourself that.

Until the government decides to take it away from you.  Then there's
jack all you can say about it.

I'm surprised you noticed.

And easily so.

Then you don't know anything of your own history.  Just a few short
years ago, there was this noble dude who live in that palace who refused
to leave his pistol practice to take shelter while London was being
bombed.  Help me out here, the palace started with a "B" and he was some
sort of royalty.  Starts with a "K"?  Lots of people remember that
*first hand*, it was reported in the newspapers.  On top of that, there
are still plenty of shotgun hunters there, there are numerous citizens
who took their pistols to club armories in France, and you've got an
Olympic Pistol Team who can't even practice on their home soil now.

Stop making up crap.

That you're making crap up to try to support your indefensible point.

Just shows you *still* aren't doing your homework.  Works just fine.

You have no idea.

Doofus.  That is such a *rarity* that it merrits comment.  Swimming
pools kill more children every year the guns despite the fact that
there's at least an order of magnatude *fewer* pools then guns in the
U.S.  It's all nice and emotional, but it's a lie.

Murdered?  0.  Nada.  Zip.  None.  Casualties happen in a war.  Unless
you're willing to say that all deaths occuring in a war are murder, then
in that case, Britain has a lot more to own up to in her history then
the U.S.

It's a statement of fact.  You don't know squat about the U.S. outside
of what you see in the Movies.  For that matter, it looks like your
knowledge of your own history is a bit weak too.  <whining voice> The
British don't have or use guns (nevermind about all those shotguns, the
handgunners that commute to France, or that royal guy we all claimed to
love so much just a few years ago in WWII).  </whining voice>
