The only bad aspect for the monk is no real taunt when you got three mobs on
you as your casting ensnare roots.
Tho i can handle  the mobs usually id love that  taunt  to get em off me.
An enchanter is nice assumeing the mezes stick or wizard but then  your
tactics is  kite and root and nuke not so effective in a dungeon.

The sks harmtouch is  very  handy when things start getting bad... And they
dont seem to be mana sponges like rangers at times can be. Rangers dish
damage out great  but taking it sucks so much mana to heal em...

A bard tho outside  who you sow or give shared wolf form is a excelent
companion for a druid... Having both the aspects of a healer  enchanter and
tank all in one...
and the  dots  they  can do stack well with druids...
