I can remember why all 8 of my ignore-ees are on my list.  The two in question?

1 - was afk more than he was at the keyboard, and wasn't even polite enough to
warn us before he went afk.  He did it again the second time.

2 - monk who went LD and never came back.  Did it the second time too.

In LDON groups QUALITY is really more important than QUANTITY.

I think this will be how I handle it in the future...
