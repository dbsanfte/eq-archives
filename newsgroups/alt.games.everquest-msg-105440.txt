Even if he is of the same sort as you - a career soloer - there are
better places to be than Everfrost at L28.

Yes, this is true. What you are disregarding is the pulls are far
faster in a dungeon and there is no downtime (if everything is okay).

At L28 highkeep's WR+RR will beat any exp, anywhere, for a soloer. If
you are one of those lucky people who play at off hours the sarnak
fort can come close (assuming a non gimp group). Biz, its not even
close. I thought the same way you did, tried to solo as a druid in the
high 20s, and found myself falling behind fast (this was when Firiona
Vie just came out, not my main druid).

A full group will kill *more* than six in a dungeon before you can
kill one and med to ready again. And they will get a dungeon exp and
group bonus on top of it. I will never make the mistake of trying to
soloing one at a time at that level again.

As for loot, as another person mentioned, some zones are very good for
loot even in a group, like netherbian.

False

True. :/

You can do better now that you can quad. But if you are root dotting
and claiming you can keep up... your friends aren't doing well in
their group in that case.

This guy doesn't have the option to quad yet. One at a time he's not
going to come close to a good group.

60. First druid to get there on my (then, not current) server, despite
an entire month taken off of EQ in the meantime. Did it by knowing
when to group and when to solo.

I don't say it to boast, you simply asked.
