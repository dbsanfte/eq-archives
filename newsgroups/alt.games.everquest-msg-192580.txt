The problem has nothing to do with KEI. The problem arises because MOBs are
grossly overpowered compared to PC warrior classes. Tanks wont solo well
when mobs of same level hit for 100dmg more, hit faster, have superior AC
and have a ton of HP extra. Casters dont enter melee so MOB melee skills are
neglected.
