"In infected cats, the virus is shed in saliva, urine, tears and milk. Cat-
to-cat transmission is by contact with any of these fluids by fighting, 
grooming, or contact with contaminated water, food or litter pans. Bite 
wounds are probably the most common form of transmission but prolonged 
close contact between cats enhances the likelihood of transmission."

That's from http://www.animalforum.com/cfeleukfiv.htm

Bite wounds are a vector, as are shared food dishes and water dishes, as 
are shared litter pans. All of these things can happen easily in the wild 
in an urban environment. One cat can go for the same fish someone threw 
away, likewise they can both piss in the same kids sandbox.

1-2% of outside domestic cats have it. I suppose thats a risk you are 
willing to take, but I am not. That's considerably higher than lightning 
odds.
 
That number jumps to up to 15% for the feral housecats you help perpetuate.

FIV infection rates for outside male cats are around 1.5-3%. Different 
disease, but one I assume you are not vaccinating against either.

From http://www.vetinfo.com/crabies.html

" If an animal dies of rabies, the rabies virus may survive for up to 
two days in the body, though.  This is a good reason to keep pets away from 
dead raccoons, opossums, ground hogs, etc. "

Likewise, a recently dead rabid animal (read as: your cats fresh kill) is 
still rabid when your cat begins to eat it.

1% - 2% is NOT miniscule.

If you doubt this, try holding your breath for 1% of a year.

Funny, it took me the same to find more complete documentation on something 
I spoke to my vet about a few weeks ago.
