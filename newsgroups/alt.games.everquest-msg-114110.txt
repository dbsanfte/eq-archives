Good Advice.  That is exactly what I do for my Barbarian Shaman.  Greater
Lightstones drop from Willow Wisps.  You will need a magic weapon to kill
them, or you will need to kill them with spells.  Sometimes you can find
regular lightstones (not greater) for sale from merchants.  These will do
until you can get a GLS.  Serpent Sight is helpful (especially for those
corpse runs) but it does not provide as good a light as a light stone.  If
you decide to make the trip to Oasis take enough money to get 14th and 19th
level spells, there are only a few of them. You will be 19 before you know
it and will have to make the run back for one spell.  This is where you will
get ALL sight type spells for your shaman.  Also, at higher levels (when you
have more money to spend) be on the lookout for a weapon or shield that
doubles as a lightsource.
