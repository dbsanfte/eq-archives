Equally as impressive is the raid mob in PF.  I can't remember it's
name (starts with an Ag I think?).  If you enter PF and turn right at
Vox's pedestal, run straight back until you smack into the wall, and it
is in the room in the middle of that round room.

I don't remember exactly what he dropped.  I do remember that it wasn't
even worth linking to the guild.  There might've been a rare or two in
the chest (wood).

Ouch.  We had some problems setting up the camp - the tank was a 50SK
(from a different guild), a couple of us were 50, and the rest were
sub-50.  It was a pick up group and the healers weren't use to the way
the tank worked, which was non-stop, try to not get bored to death
while waiting for Webclaw.  After a couple near wipes and several runs
back we got into a rhythm.  It did take several hours over a couple
days (five or six hours total).

I hate camping with every fiber of my being.  I am going back through
the heritages on the goodie side I didn't get on my way up (just
finished DWB and started Ghoulbane and GBS yesterday).  GBS scares me
in camping the books of Life and Death.  One of my friends has been on
that step since Friday (with a lot of breaks) and hasn't seen them pop
yet.

I like the scripted and triggered spawns much better.  I think SBD is
just about the best way to do a quest as possible.  No camping
anything, all the mobs spawned when you needed them, it was perfect.

The eyepatch is very nice, unfortunately it is useless for me.  It is
more about having another heritage under my belt and another rare piece
for my room.
