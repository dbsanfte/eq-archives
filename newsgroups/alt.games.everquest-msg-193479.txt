That is why the EASIEST thing to do is run two accounts.  That is if you
have two decent machines to run EQ on.  I started this last week.  I got
tired of having to find someone all the time.

I think EQ should allow you to transfer items and money between your
different chars on the same account but that will probably never be allowed.

Yes, paying 12.95 more per month to run two accounts is a pain but worth it.
How much of your time is wasted trying to find someone you trust to do a
trade with?  Having two accounts makes twinking much easier.  I would not
recommend two accounts until you are tired of a higher level character and
you want to start a new one.  Think about it.  You could take that 50ish
level character into Crushbone and collect tons and tons of belts and pads
without any degree of threat.  Then turn them over to your new character to
turn into the dwarf that accepts them.  After 7 hours of belt and pad
collecting I had a Halfling Druid twink from level 1 to level 11, almost 12.
Unless you had a real friend that would be willing to help in trading
backpacks of belts and pads every two hours you would be out of luck.

Money is the next thing.  For a low level character, 5 pp per spell is a
months salary.  Not so for your hgiher level sponsor.  Do some farming and
get about 300PP and then drop it into the arms of your new character.  He or
she will be set on spells all the way through their 20s.  NP at all.
