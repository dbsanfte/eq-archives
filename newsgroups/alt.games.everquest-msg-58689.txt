I tried DaoC and I'm coming back to EQ.  There is so much wrong with EQ that I
just couldn't take it so I gave DaoC a shot.  First couple of days are new and
exciting as usual, but it quickly wears out and you realize there isn't much to
the game at all.  It is, as people before have stated, all geared up for the
big RvR, unfortunately RvR sucks, at least in my opinion.  They recently had to
nerf archers because they were overpowered and you could zone into the frontier
area where RvR is allowed and be dead in one shot from the groups of archers
that were camping the entrance.  If you were fortunate enough to get yourself
into the epic type battle that I had envisioned for the game, the lag is so bad
it can take you ten seconds just to get your character to turn so that blows
that.  All in all I think DaoC tried to do some things to improve upon what EQ
has done and some have succeeded.  When you get to the bottom of it though,
there isn't much content leading up to RvR and RvR has been a major
dissapointment.
