I'm not a happy bunny. I spent 4k on Crystal Chitin gaunts, and instead 
of shiny plate, they look like non-descript pale grey metal on the new 
human model. Fortunately, I think I have a buyer lined up, for 5k. :)

I'd really like a Sarnak Battle Shield, since it would set off the robe 
beautifully, but alas, as a soloing druid, I also need to think of 
maximizing my mana pool. =/

But on the other hand, as soon as I can afford it, I want to get a full 
set of Gnomeskin, unless it's really as broken as you say. It's no longer 
pure, solid black, then?
