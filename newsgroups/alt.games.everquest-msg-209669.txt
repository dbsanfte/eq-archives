Best 50+ tank in 90% of situations is an ogre (sk or war). A royal
pain to level but worth it I think. Generaly Tanking belongs to War,
SK, Pally while damage output belongs to rogue, monk, ranger. Given
average equipment this should hold up with race issues being strictly
your own choice. I like humans for the ease of swapping items between
alts.
