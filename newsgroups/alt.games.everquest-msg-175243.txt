He, i got this too .. and promptly thought, I am 15th lvl?!?!?!??! WHY is he
telling me I wont get any groups in another FORTY FREAKING levels from where
I am???

I promptly told the group, I was playing my character for the here and now,
not for the here and later of what THAT person wanted.  I left the group.
Within 20 minutes I was in another group, and asked the group about this ...
their answer? You pay for the account Daynah, play it like you want to ...
and who the hell cares about 40 levels from now.

Learn me about the here and now ... not the then and there.

Am I a good shaman? Someone define what is it that defines whether a person
is a good shaman? I fill whatever roll is needed when I join a group.  I can
tank(only in the defense part), I can heal, I can nuke, I can, of course
debuff!, and I always keep all casters with dex + agi buffs, all tanks with
ac, hp, str, dex, agi buffs and hasted if no chanter is there.  I can, and
have on many occasions been 'crowd control' it isn't pretty, but is easily
mastered.(rooting the adds, DoT'ing to draw the agro, and then running in
cirlces til the group was done with whatever mob was there) ... Hell, I was
even a gopher a couple times ... group need fishing supplies while waiting
for a spawn, and no druid/wizzie in the group or area willing, so I invis'd
and ran 5 zones to get some supplies.

Personally, I find that any toon has a higher level one, is WAY to
pre-occupied with telling everyone else in the group how they have to be
acting when they are over 50th lvl and in the planes ... it REALLY ruins a
good group.

I take the help of those that offer it politely, and are really giving me
the impression of trying to help me have a better time playing. Thoise that
'bark' orders and dictate what will happen in another 40 level? /g Sorry
folks, I guess I am not up to someone ELSE's standards with MY OWN
character. I shall leave the group so as not to be slowing down your
progressions, thank you for grouping and send me a tell if any of you need
buffs while I am still in the zone."  then I /ignore <Mr
IKnowEveryoneElsesClassAndWillTellYouHowToPlayItEveryChanceIGet>  ... then
move on and put it behind me.

Maybe this is a bit of an extreme thing to do, but why should my time be
spent playing MY character the way someone else wants me to? It shouldn't,
and there is NO argument that dictates otherwise ... of course the uber
guild members will be replying and telling me I will never be 'high end
guild material" ... well ya know what? /Y-A-W-N! I am not here playing jsut
to end up in a highend guild, rght now I am here to have fun, meet people
and enjoy a fantastic game!  *IF* somewhere in the future, I happen to have
the choice of joining a higherend unber guild, then I will *at that time*
play my toon how it is expected to be played ... when required, other than
that, I will continure to play having fun my way.

*whew* ... I guess maybe I got carried away, /rant off
