I was wondering on release what thoughts may cross my mind in the first 
hour? and what will I think after playing a while?

for example

AC1 - graphics ok but what the hell do I do here - I rated the character 
tweaking complexity of it eventually.

AC2  - wow this looks fantastic, but WHAT no shop - became boring though but 
a very polished game

Horizons - poorish grahics a bit boring  - but character could be multi 
classed great craft and shops
