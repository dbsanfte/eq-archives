Hail,


    I am a Paladin who wants a FD more than anything, but also wants other
good weapons as well.  Such as Velium War Lances.  Problem is, what does a
Paladin use to build up his piercing before he can get one?  What Paladin
wants to go around using a fang or something?  Well, I heard about this
weapon called Faerie Cavalier Lance.  Dam 6, Del 22, +2 Dex, +2 Agi, +6 Cha,
3 charges of Alliance, Magic and Lore - AND it is Paladin compatible (also
WAR, BAR, ROG, RAN, SHD, SHM - all races).  OK, I have this much info on the
quest - you gotta be able to speak Faerie (I do, so no trouble there).
Apparently you also have to bring one of the Butcherblock Ogres heads to
Princess Joleena in LFay too.  But I haven't been able to get Princess
Joleena to speak to me apart from 'You can stay among my people but don't
nibble our homes'.  I heard that you are supposed to say something like 'I
will protect your homes' but I have tried just about every variation of
that.  I con apprehensive to her, do I need to raise my faction?  If so,
how? (My faction does not change with wolf form to normal faeries, don't
know about the princess though).  Any help would be much appreciated.
