You already received the answer you were asking for, so I'll just add to it.

If you decide to have her character moved from your account to hers, make
sure that both accounts have the exact same billing information.

Also, back when they used to do it for free, they required the original CD
keys, so make sure you have both of them handy if you decide to spend the
$50 to get her character moved to her account.
