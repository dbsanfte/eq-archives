Wanna know why you don't get responses in public channels as often?
People, surprisingly enough, aren't there to wipe your ass every time
you take a shit. No kidding! They expect you to be able to handle
yourself! Shocking, huh? I mean, it's such a travesty that half the
zone doesn't drop everything and come running every time you snap your
fingers. My god, what is this world coming to?

The tells are harder to ignore for most people than the public
channels. Lotta people feel pressured to help you out when you send
them a direct tell. Or they do it just to get you to leave them the
fuck alone...
