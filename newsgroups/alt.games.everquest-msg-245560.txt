Due to another post which brought up 2boxing and the best combo being Ench /
Druid, I began to wonder what was the best combo.

I currently 2box a Shaman / Monk, and do pretty well.  I have considered
rolling a Pally to go with the Shaman to increase the tanking ability.

I never even considered an Ench / Druid, nor a Necro / Rog.

What classes do you think would be good for 2boxing.
