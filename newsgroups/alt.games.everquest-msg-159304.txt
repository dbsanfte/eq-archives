Easy to see why this guild is know as one of the uber guilds on AB
There members are complete morons with no life and dont give a shit 
about any other player( or probably each other).
Some moron called Sinola from Mortalis trained about 20 mobs to a newbie 
zone entrance on purpose last night and killed some newbie standing 
there who was and easy kill.
I was fine though as im 40 levels higher than those mobs but i just 
think its shitty that someone would do that intentionally
Kind of sums it up that she is level 65 after pops only been out a short 
time. Shes obviously one of the saddos who plays it 10+ hours a day
