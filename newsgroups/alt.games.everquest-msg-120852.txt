I kinda tested it, although with only one item.  I have a SMR, which has
Spell Haste 2, and a Bracelet of Woven Grass with Spell Haste 1.  I was
casting Gather Shadows (a lvl 8 self-invis spell) with my 38th level necro,
and the Bracelet would fire off.  To test whether the SMR would work with
that particular spell, I took off the Bracelet, put it in a bag, and cast
the spell again. The SMR fired off...  No matter which item I had equipped,
the casting time was cut from 5.0 to 4.3 (it says this in the spell
description when you right-click-and-hold on the spell icon).

Hypothesis based on limited testing:  Spell Haste 2, and I suspect other 2's
and 3's,  *will* effect lower lvl spells.
