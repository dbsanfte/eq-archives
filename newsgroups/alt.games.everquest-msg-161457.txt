The counties in question, at the time, ran all of the ballots through.  The
recount complied with Florida law, IIRC.  Since the Constitution gives the
state legislatures the power to determine the method of election, and the
legislature wrote that law, the Constitution determined that Bush won.  But
who cares about that old document, anyways?

The demonstrations weren't exactly violent.

The count went on while people demonstrated.  Gore's team hammed it up.
Nothing was interfered with.  Had the political parties been reversed, you
would have been bitching about the violation of free speech.

Indeed, by independant parties.  The results were ran in the Washington
Post, a rather left-leaning publication.  All methods, save one, pointed to
a Bush victory.  Oddly enough, the Democrats were arguing against that one
method.
