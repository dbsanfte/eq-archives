Its the Sound Blaster card.... GET RID OF IT!!
I had a 128pci SB  (hehe, might have been the 64pci.. don't remember
now) card when I first started playing EQ 3 years ago and worked fine
up till one certain patch about a year or so into game.
It NEVER worked right after that.. tons of problems even being dumped
to desktop.. even after VI said they fixed issues with SB cards.

I got a Fortissimo sound and all those problems went away.
Sound works great for me now.
