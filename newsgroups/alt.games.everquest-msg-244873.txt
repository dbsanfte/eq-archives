I believe you need to work on your English comprehension skills.  You asked
the question, " I own a rental car just as much as I own a Blade of Carnage
I may have on one of my characters. I can't rent the rental care out to
another person. I'd be arrested. Why would anyone reasonably believe that
they can do essentially the same thing with that Blade of Carnage?" and I
responded with "Because of all the other people out there that have already
done so and have NOT been arrested." It didn't say in there that I think it
should be legal, but I think you knew this and that is why you snipped your
own earlier post from your reply.
