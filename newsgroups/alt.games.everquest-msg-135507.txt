The Bazaar has been one of the top 5 laggiest zones in the game since
the release of SoL. Now they implement a feature that is guaranteed to
draw the highest number of players to any single zone in the history
of EQ? They have had more than 6 months to optimize and/or re-do the
Bazaar.

Maybe VI will get a clue now, and redesign the zone. It's not like it
has to be fancy or huge (eq move/remove the Arena ).
