IMHO
Depends on what you want to do? Solo or group?

Solo:
Good
Druid - you can take this up to lvl 60 without ever grouping + TP's
Mage - you can solo this as well but you end up taking a lot of low blues in
certain levels, lots of pets

Evil
Necro - can you say fear kiting, good mana regen, and pets

Group
Wizard - just need to learn how to play your char (don't start a fight with
all your nukes!)
Shaman - awesome in large or small groups + SOW + you can melee when all
other magic users can't
Enchanter - hard to learn, harder to master!  Invaluable in a group.  There
is no pet control
Cleric - med, heal, med, heal, stun, SCREAM for help, heal, med,
med........everyone wants you.

All of these magic users get Bind Affinity which helps a lot!
