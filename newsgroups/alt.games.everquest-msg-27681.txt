Ack you picked a High-Elf eh?
No idea how much money you have at your disposal.
Your best bet is to make friends with a high skill level smith
and get them to make you some Ornate Chain. It is 1 AC higher
and less weight than banded in every slot. Check the druid vendor
in Lavastorm, and the miner vendors in the basement of highpass
for the high qua

Clerics are a plate wearing class so you have a lot of choices
as far as armor goes. Unfortunately much of the plate stuff is
heavy.
