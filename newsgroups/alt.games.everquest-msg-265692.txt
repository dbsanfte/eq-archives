I'm afraid that in the years I lived in the US, the issue of getting 
married never came up, so I'm a bit ignorant on the matter. Is there no 
such thing as a "civil marriage" in the US? What happens, for example, 
if a couple is married by a ship captain who happens to be an atheist? 
In Europe, or at least the bits of it I know of, you don't need to come 
within a mile of a religious authority to get married.
