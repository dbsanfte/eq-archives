Yep. Darth Maul... I had no reason to especially dislike the guy. 
Hell... I don't even think he was 'the villain' just an overhyped 
Palpatine's generic_henchman_01. He had no character, no depth, ... no 
lines, and very little point except as poster eye candy. Hell they even 
killed him... so they couldn't gradually flesh him into a true villain.

And Count Dooku... wtf was that. He had no depth either... hell the 
movie doesn't even make sense unless you deduce (and with foreknowledge 
of movies 4-6 its trivial) that Dooku was a diversion to allow Palpatine 
to assume control of the senate and assemble an army without dissent. 
And in that case Dooku is basically generic_henchman_02... with about as 
much depth as Darth Maul (none), and only a few more lines.

Apparently however, the Jedi get taken in by this red herring,... and 
'all' of them show up (all of them being a significantly smaller number 
than one would have expected) and get largely wiped out by an 
incompetent droid army that was previously defeated by a tribe of 
Gungans & Astroboy (Anakin), pretty much ruining the mystique and power 
of the Jedi forever to the fanbase at large. (Not to mention the force 
rewrite from a 'mystical force that surrounds all living beings' to some 
  blood parasites that apparently can be measured like a rad-count...)

And what is it with remote controlled droid armies anyways?

=)
