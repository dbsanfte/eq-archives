If you feel this way, why the hell did you ever buy EQ? EQ is setup so
that you have to deal with people the entire time you are playing...
if you dont want anyone to mess with you while you are doing your
playing, then you better quickly uninstall the game and load some
single player game before you realize how the EQ world works and end
up sitting in a corner all day crying.

>Nobody should interfere with you playing your game, period. Case closed.
