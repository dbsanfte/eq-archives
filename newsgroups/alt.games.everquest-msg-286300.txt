Heh, I've recently been getting back to soloing a bit with my 58 druid,
and you're certainly right that druids want to do the job with mostly
mana, not getting hit at all.  Though of course I do still get tagged
a bit as I try to group a quad together, and I keep my DS spells up to
take best advantage of those hits.

Prior to this, I've mostly been two-boxing with my cleric, which isn't
the most efficient combo but works okay as long as neither of them can
be killed too quickly.  Usually the cleric's able to take more of a
beating, so if things are dicey I just heal the druid until the mobs
notice, and then the druid heals the cleric (or evacs).  If I'm outside
the druid can sit on her pony and get full medding rate (though not OOC),
and her DS, plus cleric Mark of Retribution (reverse DS), plus her pet
and cleric summoned hammer -- it adds noticeably to the DOTs.

Where this ties into the current thread is that the rule of "even bars"
applies not just to hp-vs-mana bars, but across a group.  Others brought
up having a cleric's mana and fighter's HP end up even, but frankly it's
often easier to throw one more heal on the fighter and then let the
cleric med through the first part of the next fight, staying OOC for a
few extra ticks.  But with the cleric/druid pair, I find it's handy to
have the two mana bars stay roughly even, so they can med back together.
Sometimes it's hard to manage it while keeping aggro on the druid, but
it does work better when I can pull it off.
