Since you don't have any spells yet (level 9), just act like a warrior
would.  A ranger is basically a melee anyhow.  And at level 7, a ranger is
still solely a melee.

A good place to pull in Blackburrow is the central area on the first floor
down from the top.  If you follow the path down, you'll come to a flat
area--straight ahead is a narrow, bridge-like path that leads to an Elite
Gnoll guard.  Watch out for him.  To the right is an entrance to an open
area and the lake.  There is an abundance of mobs area.

Pull mobs to the flat area discussed above.
