Corpserot, do you know how pathetic and gay you sound?  I don't agree
with purchasing items on ebay, but can't just sit by while you make us
all dumber...

Do you read what you are writing?  Those of us that actually earn a
living don't have the time it takes to "earn" these high level items.
I've been playing the game for a year and a half, and my main is only
51.  So if you've got this "uber sword", then it's because you were
sitting at home, in your parent's basement, playing EQ while the rest
of us were out earning your welfare check.  You earned nothing...

We sure as hell are now....  Thank you for blessing us all with your
