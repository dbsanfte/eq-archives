At the risk of nit-picking, any SeeInvis mob can see through Hide, and at
lower levels many mobs have a tiny chance to see through it.
There is NO mob that is unaffected by the properties of Sneak itself.  You
can Sneak behind the Gods themselves if you can get up there.

To troubleshoot your situation, what *level* was your halfling rogue?
Rogues do not get their success/fail messages on Hide until 3rd level so
it's possible that you only *thought* you were hiding.
