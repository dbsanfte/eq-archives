As a 35 agnostic monk, I have to say that I couldn't be happier with
my choice.  I've been able to go most anywhere without being attacked
(save the Dark Elf town, they hate me for killing their guards for
some reason).  Plus, if/when you decide to get to Kunark, you can take
the boat from the Oasis to the Overthere without being attacked by the
various evil races there.  You can see to the Ogres and Trolls, which
helps when you're fighting in Guk or Rathe.  I did have some problems
getting the quests from the Ashen Order, but after killing 100 or so
orcs, they decided I was good enough company and let me do their
quests.
