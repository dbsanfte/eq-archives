  I can't explain it, as I've never witnessed that... maybe you were
experiencing the same issue as the original poster, with a bard song.  Maybe
you were hit by a spell or AoE.  I can only speak about what I've
experienced, and according to my experiences, the feigning during "mid
swing" thing is bogus, I haven't ONCE witnessed it happen to any of my
characters.  It just doesn't make any sense, anyway.  There isn't any
connection between the graphical representation of attacks, and the attacks
themselves.  As far as the system goes, all attacks are INSTANT.  There is a
timed delay between attacks, but once the timer ticks down to zero, the
attacks happen instantly.
