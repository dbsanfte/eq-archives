They should understand, you cant prevent technical problems that are beyond
your control (obviously :) ).

If they have a website I would suggest posting on the forums there,
explaining what has happened and that you will be back ASAP :)

If they do not understand then maybe they are not as good / nice a guild as
you first though, and may be doing you a favour in the long run :)
