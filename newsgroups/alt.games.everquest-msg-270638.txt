I call many people who don't share my goals friends, and few who do 
share my goals are even acquaintences.

What you're thinking of are clones.

If I was only friends with people who liked making swords and running 
their own businesses, I wouldn't have many friends.

Annie is suggesting that a game mechanic like that of COH, which allows 
high levels to group with low levels or vice versa, allows people of 
different goals and habits to nonetheless play together, which most 
MMOG's force her to either act like her friends, in order to keep up, or 
to abandon them like some kind of fairweather friend.

I could level two characters to 60 in the time it takes Annie to level 
one to 50, it would be a sad thing if I couldn't be her friend just 
because of that.
