    You mean have the warders offtank, right? The BLs themselves seem pretty
squishy. Yeah, combined with the BL's ability to heal they'd make
interesting offtanks. It would have to be a very open environment, though -
otherwise the mobs will ignore the warder and pound on the nearest PC. That
room before the Itraer Vius's room, when clearing to him, or maybe the
Burrower Parasite. I'll have to suggest it next time we go to one of those.
:-) Too bad mages don't heal as well - the epic pet beats the fully buffed
level 60 warder hands down.
