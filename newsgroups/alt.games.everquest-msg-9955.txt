What zones, what sort of loot, etc.  Granted, my experiences are
limited, but in my experiences, Runnyeye, and Highhold,  on prime loot,
everyone rolls, unless the group is there to get a specific member
an/the item.

In runnyeye, we had 3 loot order/roll lists,  Crown, Prime loot
chest/girdle/boots/BIM, other loot(misc BI).
