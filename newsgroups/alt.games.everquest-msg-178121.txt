In The Flesh ?
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

So ya
Thought ya
Might like to go to the show
To feel the warm thrill of confusion
That space cadet glow
Tell me is something eluding you sunshine ?
Is this not what you expected to see ?
If you want to find out what's behind these cold eyes ?
You'll just have to claw your way through the
Disguise

The Thin Ice.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Mamma loves her baby
And daddy loves you too
And the sea may look warm to you, baby
And the sky may look blue
But oooh babe
Oooh baby blue

If you should go skating
On the thin ice of modern life
Dragging behind you the silent reproach
Of a million tear stained eyes
Don't be surprised, when a crack in the ice
Appears under your feet
You slip out of your depth and out of your mind
With your fear, flowing out behind you
As you claw the thin ice

Another Brick In The Wall (Part 1).
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Daddy's flown across the ocean
Leaving just a memory
A snap shot in the family album
Daddy what else did you leave for me
Daddy what d'ya leave behind for me
All in all it was just a brick in the wall
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall

The Happiest Days Of Our Lives.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

When we grew up and went to school
There were certain teachers who would
Hurt the children anyway they could
By pouring their derisions
Upon anything we did
And exposing every weakness
However carefully hidden by the kids
But in the town it was well known
When they got home at night, their fat and
Psychopatic wives would thrash them
Within inches of their lives

Another Brick In The Wall (Part 2).
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave the kids alone
Hey, teacher, leave the kids alone !
All in all it's just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

Mother.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Mother do you think they'll drop the bomb
Mother do you think they'll like the song
Mother do you think they'll try to break my balls
Oooh ma, mother should I build a wall

Mother should I run for president
Mother should I trust the government
Mother will they put me in the firing line
Oooh ma, is it just a wasted time
Mother am I really dying

Hush now baby, baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna make all of your nightmares come true
Mama's gonna put all of her fears into you
Mama's gonna keep you right here under her wing
She won't let you fly but she might let you sing
Mama's gonna keep baby cosy and warm
Oooh babe Oooh babe Oooh babe
Of course mama's gonna help build the wall

Mother do you think she's good enough for me
Mother do you think she's dangerous tell me
Mother will she make your little boy a toy
Ooh ma, mother will she break my heart

Hush now baby, baby don't you cry
Mama's gonna check out all of your girlfriends for you
Mama won't let anyone dirty get through
Mama's gonna wait up 'till you get in
Mama will always find out where you've been
Mama's gonna keep baby healthy and clean
Oooh babe Oooh babe Oooh babe
You'll always be a baby to me

Mother, did it need to be so high ?

Goodbye Blue Sky.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Ooooooooooooooooooh
Did you see the frightened ones
Did you hear the falling bombs
Did you ever wonder
Why we had to run for shelter
When the promise of a brave new world
Unfouled beneath a clear blue sky
Ooooooooooooooooooh
Did you see the frightened ones
Did you hear the falling bombs
The flames are all long gone
But the pain lingers on

Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye

Empty Spaces.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

What shall we use to fill the empty
Spaces where we used to talk
How should I fill the final places ?
How should I complete the wall ?

Young Lust.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

I am just a new boy
A stranger in this town
Where are all the good times
Who's gonna show this stranger around ?
Ooh I need a dirty woman
Ooh I need a dirty girl
Will some woman in this desert town
Make me feel like a real man
Take this rock'n'roll refugee
Ooh Babe set me free
Ooh I need a dirty woman
Ooh I need a dirty girl

One Of My Turns.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Day after day, love turns grey
Like the skin of a dying man
And night after night we pretend it's all right
But I have grown older and
You have grown colder and
Nothing is very much fun any more.
And I can feel one of my turns coming on.
I feel cold as a razor blade
Tight as a tourniquet
Dry as a funeral drum

Run to the bedroom, in the suitcase on the left
You'll find my favourite axe
Don't look so frightened
This is just a passing phase
Just one of my bad days
Would you like to watch T.V. ?
Or get between the sheets
Or contemplate the silent freeway ?
Would you like something to eat ?
Would you like to learn to fly ? Would you ?
Would you like to see me try ?
Oh I don't know

Would you like to call the cops ?
Do you think it's time I stopped ?
Why are you running away ?

Don't Leave Me Now.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Oooh Babe
Don't leave me now
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you Babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends

Ooh Babe
Don't leave me now
How could you go ?
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night

Ooh Babe
Don't leave me now
How can you treat me this way
Running away
Ooh Babe
Why are you running away ?
Oooh Babe !

Another Brick In The Wall (Part 3).
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

I don't need no arms around me
And I don't need no drugs to calm me
I have seen the writing on the wall
Don't think I need anything at all
No, don't think I'll need anything at all
All in all it was all just bricks in the wall
All in all you were all just bricks in the wall

Goodbye Cruel World.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Goodbye cruel world
I'm leaving you today
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye all you people
There's nothing you can say
To make me change my mind
Goodbye

Hey You !
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Hey you ! out there in the cold
Getting lonely, getting old, can you feel me ?
Hey you ! standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles, can you feel me ?
Hey you ! don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight.

Hey you ! out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone, would you touch me ?
Hey you ! with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out, would you touch me ?
Hey you ! would you help me to carry the stone ?
Open your heart, I'm coming home

But it was only fantasy
The Wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain.

Hey you ! out there on the road
Always doing what you're told, can you help me ?
Hey you ! out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall, can you help me ?
Hey you ! don't tell me there's no hope at all
Together we stand, divided we fall

Is There Anybody Out There ?

Is there anybody out there ?

Nobody Home.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

I've got a little black book with my poems in
Got a bag with toothbrush and a comb in
When I'm a good dog they sometimes throw me a bone in
I got elastic bands keeping my shoes on
Got those swollen hand blues
I've got 13 channels of shit on the T.V. to choose from
I've got electric light
And I've got second sight
I've got amazing powers of observation
And that is how I know
When I try to get through
On the telephone to you
There'll be nobody home

I've got the obligatory Hendrix Perm
And the inevitable pinhole burns
All down the front of my favourite satin shirt
I've got nicotine stains on my fingers
I've got a silver spoon on a chain
Got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains
I've got wild staring eyes
And I've got a strong urge to fly
But I've got nowhere to fly to
Ooh Babe when I pick up the phone
There's still nobody home

I've got a pair of Gohills boots
And I've got fading roots...

Vera.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Does anybody here remember Vera Lynn
Remember how she said that
We would meet again
Some sunny day
Vera ! Vera !
What have become of you
Does anybody else in here
Feel the way I do ?

Comfortably Numb.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Hello,
Is there anybody in there ?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home
Come on now,
I hear you're feeling down
I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax,
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts ?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

O.K.,
Just a little pin prick
There'll be no more aaaaaaah !
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up ?
I do, believe it's working, good
That 'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go.

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child
I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

The Show Must Go On.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Ooh Ma ooh Pa
Must the show go on
Ooh Pa take me home
Ooh Ma let me go

There must be some mistake
I didn't mean to let them
Take away my soul
Am I too old is it too late

Ooh Ma Ooh Pa
Where has the feeling gone ?
Ooh Ma Ooh Pa
Will I remember the songs ?
The show must go on.

Run Like Hell.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

You better make your face up in
Your favourite disguise
With your button down lips
And your roller blind eyes
With your empty smile
And your hungry heart
Feel the bile rising from your guilty past
With your nerves in tatters
As the cockle shell shatters
And the hammers butter
Down your door
You better run

You better run all day
And run all night
And keep your dirty feelings
Deep inside. And if you
Take your girlfriend
Out tonight,
You better park the car
Well out of sight
'cos if they catch you in the back seat
Trying to pick her locks
They're gonna send you back to mother
In a card board box
You better run.

Waiting For The Worms.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Ooh You cannot reach me now
Ooh No matter how you try
Goodbye cruel world it's over
Walk on by

Sitting in a bunker here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come
In perfect isolation here behind my wall
Waiting for the worms to come

Waiting to cut out the deadwood
to clean up the city
to follow the worms
to put on a blackshirt
to weed out the weaklings
to smash in their windows
and kick in their doors.
for the final solution
to strengthen the strain
to follow the worms
to turn on the showers
and fire the ovens
for the queens and the coons
and the reds and the Jews
to follow the worms

Would you like to see Britania
Rule again, my friend ?
All you have to do is follow the worms
Would you like to send our coloured cousins
Home again, my friend ?
All you need to do is follow the worms.

Stop.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Stop
I wanna go home
Take off this uniform
And leave the show
And I'm waiting in this cell
Because I have to know
Have I been guilty all this time.

The Trial.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Good morning Worm Your Honour
The crown will plainly show
The prisoner who now stands before you
Was caught red handed showing feelings
Showing feelings of an almost human nature
This will not do

Call the schoolmaster
I always said he'd come to no good
In the end Your Honour
If they'd let me have my way I could
Have flayed him into shape
But my hands were tied
The bleeding hearts and artists
Let him get away with murder
Let me hammer him today

Crazy, toys in the attic I am crazy
Should I go fishing
They must have taken my marbles away

You little shit, you're in it now
I hope they throw away the key
You should have talked to me more often
Than you did, but no you had to
Go your own away. Have you broken any
Homes up lately ?
"Just five minutes, Worm Your Honour
Him and me alone"

Babe
Come to mother baby let me hold you
In my arms
M'lud I never wanted him to
Get in any trouble
Why'd he ever have to leave me
Worm Your Honour let me take him home

Crazy, over the rainbow I am crazy
Bars in the window
There must have been a door there in the wall
When I came in
Crazy over the rainbow he is crazy

The evidence before the court is
Incontravertable, there's no need for
The jury to retire
In all my years of judging
I have never heard before
Of someone more deserving
The full penalty of law
The way you made them suffer
Your exquisite wife and mother
Fills me with the urge to defecate
But my friend you have revealed your
Deepest fear
I sentance you to be exposed before
Your peers

Tear down The Wall !

Outside The Wall.
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

All alone, or in twos
The ones who really love you
Walk up and down outside the wall
Some hand in hand
Some gathered together in bands
The bleeding hearts and the artists
Make their stand
And when they've given you their all
Some stagger and fall after all it's not easy
Banging your heart against some mad buggers'
Wall
