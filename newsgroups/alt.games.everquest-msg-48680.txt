Agree on the begging. The EASIEST way to get all high level people that
would normally consider helping you, is to shout out every 30 sec if anyone
can give you some plat and items.

Whenever i have something i dont need/want to sell, and my guild cant use, i
head to Kelethin (the wood elf city, my home), and find some newbies that
can use it. Usually make some quest up that they can do to get the item.
More fun fo both parts to actually work for some items than just getting
them handed to you.

Asking nicely about things also work. Im a druid and can cast the Spirit of
Wolf (sow) spell. It make you run faster, so you wont be killed when youre
fleeing from someting. And I (and most other druids) notice the difference
between "can i have a sow please" and "hey d00d, sow me". Being polite is
the key to getting help and buffs.

Also roleplaying works. Most people dont roleplay (as in, trolls speak
normal english, people completely ignore the char they play, and just play).
For me personally its a fresh breath of air when i meet a newbie that
roleplay. Met a great halfling rogue that roleplayed 100%, and she did get
all the stuff i had for newbies, and went out to get her some extra stuff
too.
