As long as more and more people buy these gas-guzzling monsters the demand for
gas will be higher and when there is high demand there is HIGH PRICES!  What
amazes me is that even with gas prices predicted to go as high as $3/gal by July
4th SUV sales are higher than ever and continue to rise.  I guess if you can
afford a $35,000 truck you can afford the $50 it  takes to fill it up.
Unfortunately my Saturn which used to cost $9 to fill up now costs $16

I applaud the mayor of Chicago's attempt to get everyone to boycott personal
transportation and use metro/loop and other public modes of transportation.  Gas
is already well over $2.00 a gallon there so it shouldn't take too much
convincing - especially when 80% of your gas is used up SITTING in traffic jams.
