Hey, iksar start out with 100 swimming, so it's no big deal.
I used to use the canal to get between east/west Cabilis; it
was as fast as running and helped skillup swimming.  (At 200
swimming, I seem to be about as fast as sow, or maybe just
jboots.)  I still tend to swim between the monk guild and the
bank, rather than run around on the walkways.  It was really
a drag recently when the "jump out of the water" code was
broken and I had to use the ladders to get out.

Anyway, as an iksar who's spent quite a lot of time (and still
needs to spend more) becoming non-KOS in all the OTHER starting
cities, I'm always happy to see someone else suff... ah, that
is, happy to see other people exploring the faction game. :-)
Congratulations on an impressive accomplishment!
