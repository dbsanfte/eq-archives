Vendors can have a larger inventory than they can display, so it is
possible that a vendor has one or more item X's, but is not showing
any.

By appropriate buying and selling, you can get the vendor to replace
items on display with items from the storeroom.

You start out by selling an X to the vendor, so that you can be sure
the vendor has an X.
