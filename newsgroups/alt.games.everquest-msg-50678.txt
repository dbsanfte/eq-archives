I play with my wife..

You just have to know your limitations as a couple. She was running around,
flirting and the like. Which doesn't bother me a whole lot, assuming she
keeps it 'in game'. Personal E-mail, phone numbers, etc.. Are going too
far..

She would get mad if I flirted around, but it can't work that way.. I told
her something's gotta give.. Either we both flirt around, or we both don't..

If you don't have decent communication as a couple, or are very jealous, I
would suggest either not playing the game, or keep anything like flirting
between just the 2 of you.

Fourtunately, we do have good communication. If you wanna see things go sour
real fast, start getting personal e-mail addresses.. I would use only one
specific e-mail for in game stuff only, give the spose all the info about
it, and you should be fine. All depends on your level of trust.. If you are
on shakey ground as it is, be careful in MMRPG's..
