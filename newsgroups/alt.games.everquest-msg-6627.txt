and seen the light and it isn't in the Lake of Ill Omen.  My little pearl
for darkies in their late teens early 20's is the OT.  I can't understand
why everyone thinks the LOIO is the place to be if you are a dark race and
want to fight in Kunark at this level.

Right near the outpost is a stretch of land going east all the way to the
sarnak fort that is full of sabretooths, rhinos, cockatrice, sarnaks,
succulants just ripe for the pickins.

1) Bound in outpost, so a CR is a mere 10-30 sec run.  CR to LOIO is a
terror filled event.
2) bank in outpost
3) merchants in outpost
4) guards at outpost who will help with overpulls, or trains
5) Rhinos drop horns at times that sell for 2.5pp.  I usually can get 4 or
so before I return to sell
6) no add ons... I repeat... nothing will aggro you there except maybe
sarnaks and I never had that happen.  I've had tigers and cockatrice
literally run me over while I was fighting one of their brethren and they
kept on walking.
7) Zone is half as full as LOIO and most of those are ledgers lvl 30 and
above on the other side of the zone.
8) That area is always empty... rarely do I see another player fighting
there.
9) Can usually find a few people in zone who will group (although not as
easy as LOIO), but I'm at the level where I'm soloing here now anyway.
10) can sit and med wherever w/out looking over your shoulder.  One time I
was at 1 bub health and saw a rhino.  Ran near him, bandaged and sat.  He
took off,  I followed a bit, sat some more.  Did this almost all the way
across the plains, before I had enough health to take him down.  Can't say
that for the lake.


BTW: If you play on Drinal, then this area is a bad place to hunt... Bad,
bad, bad I tell you.  You should go to the LOIO, much better hunting grounds
;-)
