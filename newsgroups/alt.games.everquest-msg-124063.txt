 *no drop* FS rapier is still an unknown quest or broke.

As for why they didn't attack him, they are not on the Fv faction
table. Leech/lamprye type MoB, Pirates, giants will not agro the FV
faction table. Rarely, they will wander into the city and mostly they
are trained into the city by people who think the guards will kill
them and instead just get lowbies shopping for spells or banking
killed.
