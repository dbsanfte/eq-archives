Its the biggest, most popular game in the world,
just about every country has a football team. 

With good reason.

It arouses passions as no other sport can. Unlike
other games  that masquerade as football, it
requires skill rather than brute force. Size and
weight is no restriction to any player.

I understand that... I know lots of people that
like minority sports.

It is.

Games like gridiron, basketball, and baseball are
focused around the coaches, rather than the
players.

You do realise that the USA are current FIFA world
