Hmm maybe thats what it was?  On the other mobs tho, I could pretty much get
agro the second my monk pressed attack (of course they'd be fleeing/dead
within 5 seconds, wheras the weird agro one probably took 5+ mins of beating
on)

The ranger wasn't trying to keep agro in that fight, the main point of using
my monk was her cleric (and my shaman) don't want faction hits.. so it wass
better me tanking it with >7khp than a 1-2kHP ranger.

It wasn't really a problem, I just ae memblur'd a few times before it died,
but it was weird as hell (mob in flee mode+memblur = usually warps
away/home)

Cuz hes a lazy pos?  I dunno.. he was botting, so maybe he was just trying
to do too much.
He was definately neglecting his Paladin tho, agro was shitty and I took
agro easily/often.

I think thats a problem when people bot-solo a lot..  they start forgeting
the difference between solo and groups (you know like that druid who solod
for 55 levels, and then when he groups, with NO heals or DS memmed, and is
fucking apalling?)

Its a problem for some people thats for sure.. I like to think it doesn't
cover me too bad though.  When my performance is dropping because of botting
(or the group isnt operating at "optimal", I'll happily make whatever
changes are needed to keep the group at full-pace (im an exp freak).

Some people would never take a real person over their bots.. but not me.

Like I enjoy running 4 damn chars at once? lmao yeah right.. find a cleric
and chanter, and I'll log the bots off instantly (I do keep my shaman 99% of
the time tho).

4-6 chars just isnt efficient in my PoP exp zones (but 6 chars sure owns for
leveling twinks!)
