Don't attack Yvolcarn (or the named drake, can't remember what it is 
called).  Don't try and pull any wyvern next to Yvolcarn.

Chat with the other people hunting there, it is much easier when 
everyone is friendly and shares the spawns.  I made a couple of friends 
during my time there as well as joining a guild because of it.

Oh and don't forget the five spawns in the tower. SoE means you can pull 
them with no problem and they are often left alone.

That was my experience anyway.
