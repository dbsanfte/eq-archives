Thank you!  I was uncertain and wanted to make sure before I sold yet more
spell components for an incredibly small amount of money.

You don't need a list because you just covered it.

The fire beetle eye is not consumed though, my druid has had the same one
since level 4 ;) It is even used on the 52 dot. So just always have a
fire beetle eye in a pack, I keep it my always have pack which includes
my 121 charisma kit for buying stuff and various resist items.

The only consumed ones are batwings and fish scales, both can be bought
in unlimited quantities from the erudite reagent lady vendor in the last
middle inn in East commons before you zone into WC (short runt from WC
druid rings and you can see it before you zone into EC) I don't know what
the official player name is for that inn.. I never spent enough time in
EC as a youngin.
