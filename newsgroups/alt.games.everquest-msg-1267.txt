Sometimes rooting may be helpful, but often it is dangerous.  It causes
mobs that were running to attack whoever's closest, which can get people
killed.  

The other day someone helpfully rooted something I was trying to pull. 
I couldn't pull the mob, I had to sit and wait until root wore off. 
Then once we finally got the mob pulled back to our group, our plan was
to taunt kite it to prevent damage to our tank.  Unfortunately the
person helpfully rooted it again and the tank started taking damage.  We
had to heal the tank and do some extra damage to the mob to get it
unrooted.  A couple of us almost died.  The "helper" was a person in my
guild who just didn't understand what we were trying to do.  We talked
afterward and had a good laugh about it though.  

I've been guilty of messing things up with root too.  I was pulling
something back to our group and I accidentally rooted it near our
medding caster.  Ouch!  Good thing he wasn't afk.
