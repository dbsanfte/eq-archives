Stromm is the most populous server.  In a few months, when most of
these players are crammed into the relatively small number of zones
with non-raid content for L46+ (small compared to the huge number of
lowbie zones they're scattered across now), it's gonna be a lot less
pleasant environment than today.  Or so I expect.  Find out when for
sure when we get there I guess.
