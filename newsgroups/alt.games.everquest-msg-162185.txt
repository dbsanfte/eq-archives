Yup, the bottom has definitely fallen out of the BD market.  One week I can
get 1.3K, the next 750pp, the next I can't give 'em away.

Last time I looked in the bazaar on CT one guy had a stack for 450 ... and
has had the same stack for nearly a week.

Funny thing is that there are still folks who blindly pop a 2K price tag on
'em and get pissed when they don't have folks falling over themselves to
pick 'em up.

Amazing.  Simply amazing.
