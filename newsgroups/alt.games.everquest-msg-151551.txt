It hard to diagnose for certain at a distance, but I strongly
suspect that you are delusional.  While I know of a number of
happy husband/wife combos in EQ, all of them were married for
years prior to starting play.  OTOH, some of the very best
deals I have gotten buying gear from other players have come
with the story:  "I bought this for my GF, but now she's not
my GF anymore..."

Oh well, good luck with your, er, strategy.  :)
