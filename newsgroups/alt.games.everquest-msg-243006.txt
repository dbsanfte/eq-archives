Greetings all,

We are still experiencing issues with our login server which is
affecting your ability to connect to the game servers.  Our operations
team is working on the issue and hopes to have a resolution for you
soon.  We do apologize for duration of this problem and thank you for
the patience you have shown while we work on this. 

Thanks all.
