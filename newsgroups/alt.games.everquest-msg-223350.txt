I've found rescue to be the easiest after slaughter, but I know that
most players tend to avoid rescue.  I think I've done 3 or 4 rescues
and only failed on one of them.  Having a map helps, but if you can
figure out which direction the "cries for help" are coming from it's
easier than assassination, because you don't face a "boss mob".  It's
basically a slaughter in a particular direction.
