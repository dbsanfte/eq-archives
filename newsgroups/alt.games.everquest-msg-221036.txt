    The knight gets his place in an XP group because of fast, reliable aggro
more than anything else. If someone else that's better at tanking has that,
the knight just lost his edge in getting a group. That's not my analysis,
that's the analysis of the "scared shitless" group of knights that post to
FoH's boards. As for developers, it would trivialize a ton of content in the
game if a warrior could walk in and get aggro quickly. There's even mobs
that cannot be AE taunted specifically so they can't be switched onto a tank
at will.
