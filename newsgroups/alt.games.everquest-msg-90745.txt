	That is not correct.  You can move eight characters total, each one coming
from a different server.

	I was signed up for Legends myself.  I'm not going through with it because
my car just broke down, and I'm looking at either expensive repairs or buying
another one.  In neither case does it really make sense for me to be paying
$30 more a month for EQ in the near future.  I was moving two characters from
E'ci, and one from Lanys.  There was no need to move the character from Lanys
to E'ci first.  The web form asks you which server you want to move from, and
then which character on that server.

|This is all in the FAQ at the legends site.

	Pity you didn't read it correctly.
