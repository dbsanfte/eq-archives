No, but I do need to carry batwings, fire beetle eyes, fish scales, various
gems, reagents for pets, buffs etc, and some cost a HELL of a lot more than
a stack of bandages.

It's called Protection of the Glades/ Protection of the Nine, Aego,
Temperance.  Where's MY +1500 mana spell?

Does that regen health?  no.

Virtue.  +1500 hit points.

Aego. 4 reagents (peridots) to cast, +1300 hitpoints, +69 AC.

shall I go on?

And I must have missed it where non-chanter casters can KEI themselves.

Blessing of REplenishment.  +25HP/tick, (only lasts 20 mins though but there
none the less).

Thsi was a quick scan of the spells at castersrealm.
