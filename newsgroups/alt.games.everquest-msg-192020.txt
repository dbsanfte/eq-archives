Notice your statement and then notice the sentence FROM the patch message
relating to fixes in the grammar and spelling of certain items in game.  I
think the answer to your question is just people not taking the time to edit
text before they release it.  I caught it the very first time when simply
skimming through the various fixes, so you'd think if someone was paid to
sit and check for mistakes and was paying greater attention, things like
this and the original problems would have been caught.  But that's just my
opinion.  Just wanted to point out the total irony in making a grammatical
mistake in a sentence about certain grammatical mistakes that were being
fixed.  :P
