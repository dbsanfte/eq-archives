Seems like the assassinate are the most fun because they require some
thought once you finally get to mob.  Also, there's this whole sort of
"Mission Impossible" feeling to it.... "Jim, Mr. Big will be boarding
a plane in 90 minutes to leave the country.  Your mission, should you
chose to accept it, is to stop him and recover the nukes."  

I think I also like the assassinations because probably the craziest,
most up and down LDoN I ever had was an assassinate mission.  We were
killing our way in, doing really well, strong group, no problems, lots
of time, when suddenly the bard announces that he and the warrior are
going to "go scout".  So the rest of the group ended up stuck in a
room with a ton of mobs.  Of course, the warrior and bard end up
aggroing something and dying.  Plus they didn't know where the rest of
the group was... the bard had told us "stay here" without really
looking to see where we were.

BUT, we then proceeded to lull our way to the boss, I mezzed the
boss's attendants, we kill the boss with almost zero time left on the
clock.  It was a real rush because after the earlier screwup I had
completely assumed that we would fail, that we didn't have a chance in
hell of making it.

Just wish that I could get groups to accept them, seems like most of
the time the group leader just asssumes that no one will even consider
doing an assassination.
