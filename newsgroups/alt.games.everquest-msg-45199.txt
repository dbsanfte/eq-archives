Round trip ticket, eh?  Thats a thought, but what happens when I
port out, and then spire back up?  OK, reset my return to the new
one.  Now what if I get a port up, when I return this time, do
I still spire to the most recent one, or was it a LIFO list, and I'm
working my way backwards?  What if I've -never- spired up, which
spire do I go "back" to, or does it not work that direction, in which
case what happens if I'm a Cat?  Are there no port locations at
all on Luclin?  If I can bind there I can still circumvent the spires
by gating or (melee) getting a  TL.

Remember the firepots debacle, where they decided to make
an entire zone unbindable just to prevent people from being able
to casually gate to firepots and then port to wherever?

I see the same basic problem happening with Luclin, not insouluable,
but it seems they like to solve problems by hitting them with a huge
Nerf stick; TD would be -far- more utilized than it is now if (as
originally
intended) it was a self bindable zone like most in the world.  Even
more utilized if there was a bindable spot in it somewhere for melee.
