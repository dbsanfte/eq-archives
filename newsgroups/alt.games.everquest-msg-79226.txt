Gladly. I'm on Innoruuk, and I have no problem with age. As I said in my
previous post, I did apologoze to him. That show up as an age related
problem too? I went to far as to write to Verant and let them KNOW what I
did and what the circumstances are. You don't know me, and you never shall,
probably much to the good of us both. I already admitted that I was in the
*wrong*.
