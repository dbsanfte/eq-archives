Unless this has been nerfed in the past month or so, you
are incorrect.

While the mob has a specific number of hp, you don't get
the kill based on whether you did 51%+ of those HP,
you get it based on whether you did 51%+ of the total
damage done.

Whats the difference?

Well, for one thing, mobs regenerate damage... it almost
always takes more than 100% of a mobs damage to kill
a mob, unless you can do it quite rapidly.

Further, many mobs heal themselves or are healed by other
mobs.  Again, you'll end up doing more than 100% of their
total HP to kill them... in some cases 200% or 300% if
you don't get their casting interrupted.

In making sure that these two cases are covered, Verant
introduced the "total damage done" mechanism.  What
this means is that the final blow done counts for its full value,
be it 10 points, 1 point... or 2000 points, and be there
1 point remaining to kill the mob or twenty or 1999.

Melee characters are rarely able to KS by this method,
although I suppose a rogue might have a good shot at
it.  On the other hand, a wizard seems almost purposefully
constructed to do this sort of thing.

I have, by the way, actively PL'd and been PL'd.  When
you are doing this sort of thing on purpose, you'll not
use an outrageous overkill nuke to kill the mob; you'll
also not just wait till 51%... you'll more likely go to
60% or so, and then let off a nuke that may or may not
fully kill the target... point is to make sure to do less than
half, while speeding up the kill rate.

This also isn't all that efficient.

Try this instead:  Fight the target down about 95 %,
atone, let the PL do the remaining damage to a mob
which is running... snared if possible.  Much faster
that way.  Note that now you are setting up the PL
to KS you... but noone is going to complain.

If you can't Atone, zone.
