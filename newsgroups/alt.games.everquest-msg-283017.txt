BL pet has nothing but melee and a proc ... it doesn't stop to cast, it 
isn't 'balanced' (damage-wise) to compensate for stunning, and it has more 
HP

so...yeah, BL pet beats mage pets...moot point if you're bothered by leaving 
BL out of melee, so it doesn't matter (i'd feel the same way)

did you mean at high levels? or in general? there is a lot to consider with 
resists - it's possible you had some bad luck

use fire nukes in velk's and cold nukes in sol a/b ... etc ... i would never 
list resists among the reasons to choose / not choose a class, but you're 
not alone

i'm also pretty sure mob resists got changed sometime in the last 3 years, 
but i could be mistaken ...

tash is only a magic debuff ... the mage himself will have a cold/fire 
debuff, and all the mage's good nukes are cold/fire, so the tash isn't the 
holy grail it would be if you were playing another class

as far as defense goes, the enchanter really is king - but the necro, as you 
were mentioning you may be preferring, can do a few miracles himself ...

pets can tank up to the 'lower-high' levels and then again at the top end 
while slumming, in my experience...the focus items are increasingly 
important starting in the late 50's...if you're just trying to get to 50, 
you'll do fine - your problems will arise in the level(s) right before 
getting a new pet

truth be told, most player tanks have the same problems in those same 
levels...maybe i am only thinking of PoP+ though...glad this is a public 
forum =)





have fun with your new necro!!
