First of all, holy crap man, the [Backspace] key is at the top-right of
your keyboard.  I'm no grammar nazi but posting crap like this is just
lazy.

Second, you can read about the spells at allakhazam.com

Third, as for buying the spells, you have to buy them with crystals you
earn by completing DON missions.  Think of the DON crystals like LDON
points, except that they are tradeable.  You can buy the crystals in
the bazaar if you wish, so technically you can buy anything from those
merchants with platinum, via crystals provided by other players.  The
only caveat is that you have to have proper faction with the merchant.
There is a good merchant and an evil merchant.  (Good accepts radiant
crystals as money and evil accepts ebon crystals as money).  You have
to choose one side and work on that faction.  Different races and
religions yield different starting factions.

The good news is that you can get faction up and earn crystals
relatively fast.  You earn anywhere from around 20 to around 40
crystals per mission and the missions generally take about an hour,
less if you regularly group with good players.  (Some missions can be
completely VERY quickly).  Also, if you cannot get a group, there are
tasks you can complete to improve faction on your own.  You may or may
not be able to solo any of those at your level, however.  You may still
need to bring a friend or two.  Talk to the mercenaries just outside
SolB in the new Lavastorm to learn about the tasks.
