I have updated my drivers and my character no longer appears black.
What is dopropertinting suppose to do, anyway? Perhaps I am not very
observant, but now that I am no longer black, I see no difference 
when using it than when not using it.

I am wondering if I see my character as others do.  I have a Gnome-mage
that looks to me as he did the day he was created... wearing something
like overalls :)  Although I have picked up a few items and am 
wearing them in my inventory, they do not show up, yet I see other 
Gnome-mages running around in yellow robes and such. The only thing that
changes about my character is the weapon he is holding.
