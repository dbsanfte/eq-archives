Discussion on the Sony boards about the collision issues received plenty 
of Dev updates so those of us who read the boards new what was going to 
be in the patch.

Patch message is out now though so I guess you guys have seen it too,

- Fixed an issue with some casters having more hitpoints than intended 
after the last patch.

- Fixed an issue that was causing problems with some NPC pathing.
- Players should now be receiving the same kind of push from NPC attacks 
as the did prior to our last patch.
- Players using custom UIs should no longer crash when clicking on an 
item link.
- Two handed weapons should no longer show up as unusable if you have a 
shield equipped.
