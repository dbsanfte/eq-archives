A while back I started a Vah Shir warrior.  Completely untwinked, and
although I didn't do much with the newbie armor quests, I did find
them somewhat fun.  At least it gives you something to look for while
you kill rats or greyhoppers or whatever it is that I was killing.  I
was having a pretty good time and got up to level 6 on my own, then my
wife insisted on taking me to Paludal and doing the drood powerlevel
thing.
