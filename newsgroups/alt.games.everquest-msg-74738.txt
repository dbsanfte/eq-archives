well, this would only happen if someone with the lore key put it in that
bank after the owner asked for it.  If someone else put it in, you'd figure
the one in the bank would suddenly dissappear or a warning message could be
done, I guess.  Cannot open Bank because duplicate keys or something.  Like
they do in trading messages now.  Or just not allow the lore keys to be put
in the bank.

This is another thing that is noteworthy though.
