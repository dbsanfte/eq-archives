The Horsemen Arrive
Find this song on Sheet music, CD

Written by E. Bloom, D. Roeser and J. Shirley
Performed by Blue Oyster Cult

Forgive me if my laughter sounds cracked
Forgive me if I smile badly
It's only that I've run off the track
Derailed by the irony

Forgive me if my laughter sounds cracked
Forgive me if I smile badly
It's only that I've run off the track
Derailed by the irony

Can you hear the hooves, can you hear the riders coming
On presidential roofs listen to the sinister drumming
Can you hear the hooves, can you hear the riders coming
On presidential roofs hear the sinister drumming

They warn of Armageddon, they warn us of apocalypse
The future's as a fool's invention
Of choking skies and computer chips

(There's a nightmare) civilization
(There's a monster) industry

Four horsemen have already arrived
I see them above us, already here
Four horsemen with hooves like knives
I say again, already here

(There's a nightmare) civilization
(There's a monster) industry
(There's a devil) human corruption
(There's a vampire) human greed

Can you hear the hooves, can you hear the riders coming
On presidential roofs listen to the sinister drumming
Can you hear the hooves, can you hear the riders coming
On presidential roofs hear the sinister drumming

(There's a nightmare) civilization
(There's a monster) industry
(There's a devil) human corruption
(There's a vampire) human greed
(There's a nightmare) civilization
(There's a monster) industry
(There's a devil) human corruption
(There's a vampire) human greed
