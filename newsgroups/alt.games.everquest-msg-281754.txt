Now that, I like.

The assumption is that z co-ordinates are on the same scale as x and y
co-ordinates, but I can't think of a good reason why they wouldn't be,
although it's still a small risk.

On the assumption that a human is 6 feet tall, this gives you /loc co-ord
points per in-game feet.  You can then compare that to the /loc co-ord
points per in-game unit of range (i.e. 100 range on cheal or whatever), and
work out an in-game feet per unit of range value.
