i just checked a maglo profile, and it occured to me that i never played a
character with more than 1000 AC

so WTF is with making AC a fraction out of 1000 ? doesn't 1498/1000 AC look
stoopid ? it doesn't make sense


i haven't been around long enough to even guess at why this is

(and while i'm doing this post . . .)

so, WTF is with making ATK a fraction of 1000? its not like its relative to
some other ATK, like how one 1HS weapon relates to others as a fraction of
your total ATK (wouldn't that be nice?)

and holy HELL why can't mana have a numerical value ? everything else is
exact

exp doesn't have exact numerical values *displayed* -- but that's fine with
me, actually (does that make me, as the author of this post, turkey?)
