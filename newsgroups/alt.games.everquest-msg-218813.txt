Jeebus, no!

Don't make an SK or Pally your MT - warriors all the way.  The defensive
discipline all by itself makes them >>> SK's and Pally's as an MT.

Now, having said that... you could probably get away with a SK or Pally MT
all the way through Luclin.  Vex Thal might be challenging but still doable
with the right equipment / AA's.

But once you hit PoP, SK's and Pally's just won't cut it.  You *need* a
warrior, one with good equipment and lotsa AA's.  SK's and Pally's will just
drain your clerics' mana before pushing up daisies.
