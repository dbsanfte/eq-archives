Pot. Kettle. Black. You are a hypocritical idiot.

>What I am saying is that EQ is overreacting, and that's a sign of fear.

As a player of the DAoC beta, I can say that ANY reaction is overreacting.

Fear? Oh please. You are yet another in a very, VERY long line of morons
who have come along and claimed that The Next Big Thing is going to spell
the end of The Big Thing Now. Morons like you were doing this in the UO
newsgroups when EQ came out, morons like you were doing this in the EQ
newsgroups when AC came out, when AO came out, and now when DAoC is
coming out. Please just go away.

Have you actually READ the letter? Nowhere do they even remotely hint at
anything even vaguely close to this.
