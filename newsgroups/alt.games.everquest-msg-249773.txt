What do you mean getting some of the cash back? You aren't 
entitled to any cash back. You paid to play a game, and that's it.

Because precisely the reason people are opposed to that is that 
it doesn't level the playing field at all, it just links it to 
your RL position. So, I'm letting the group down because I'm not 
spending RL money on my Improved Healing IV item? That's not the 
game I want to play, thank you very much.
