I am so sick and tired of this unfairness from Verant. My halfling
dr00d is completely useless in a group cause everyone wants a cleric
instead.  I petitioned at least 15 times now for a GM to give druids a
resurrection spell, and they STILL haven't implemented it.  And get
this: The other day, I got bored soloing in NToV so I asked a guide if
he could help me get my epic.  She flat out refused (even though I
asked REPEATEDLY)!  What the hell am I paying an extra 3 bucks for if
the guides won't even provide help when I need it?!  Guess I have to
transfer to Legends to get minimal service now.

Anyway, I finally got enough money from porting and sowing to start a
warrior twink in full Kael armor and dual-wielding lore centi
longswords. Ordered a fungi tunic from ebay to PL him faster, and now
what do I hear?  Those bastards at Verant are adding a level
restriction, making it completely useless! Once again prooves that
Verant is trying to get rid of old players and make it easy for the
spoiled n00bs.  I bet Sarah Brady works for Verant, which is why they
refuse to put gunpowder in the game.
