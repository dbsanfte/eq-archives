Glad to hear you're having a great time!  To answer your questions...

short term upgrades - look for a velium weapon in the bazaar.  They should
go for 5 - 10 pp.
1 handed slashing is the epic weapon type, so if you plan on doing the epic
someday, get a scimitar, although for my Druid, I just bought a scepter
(1HB) and replaced a 1HS weapon.  I don't melee anymore so it's not THAT big
of an issue to me.

for armor....hmmm....Lockjaw Hide Vests are fairly cheap, as are Brown
Chitin Protectors.  Both should last you a while.


With LoY, you get extra bank space, the map, new areas...so yeah, it's worth
it.  I got it and don't care for playing a frog.  If you have broadband,
just download it from Sony.  There's no key or anything to worry about.
just download and activate from login screen. It'll automatically enable it.
