Blessed Armor of the Risen, 58 cleric self-only buff

Raid-level Luclin mobs drop it, IIRC, and it sells for
somewhere around 10kpp on blue servers.

It can be done by trial and error.  It's not that difficult
to tell what a spell does by looking at the gem associated
with it and casting it on green mobs or yourself or a friend.
The only "difficult" to check cleric spells are Mark of
Retribution and Mark of Karn since you'd most likely have
the necessary text spam filtered by then or have to be
watching the health *numbers* change.  And it's rather hard
to tell how much damage a DoT is doing, of course, if you
don't know how many XPs a mob has (although it is easy to tell
that a spell is a DoT...)

And castersrealm or http://lucy.fnord.net (LUCY is better, IMO)
both provide the information as well.  LUCY also gives you
information on stacking issues that can come in handy as well.
