Thanks for your input everyone!  I've passed on the opinions, but it looks
like he's going to try and stick with it, as they seemed to have backed off
a little.  I hope to find a guild later on that will help me get flagged,
but that's a ways off.  Until then I have friends that can help out if I
need assistance, or other players.  I really need to work on my grouping,
mostly solo so far.
