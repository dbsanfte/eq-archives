Yeah I was gonna hazard an answer but the truth is I haven't ever tried 
anything more than a couple of quick transactions when my 2nd machine was 
down. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it seemed to work in the short 
time I had to do it. I can't stand playing anything but fullscreen when I'm 
actually playing so I haven't tried anything like combat, but it looks like 
it would work.

Big patch tonight or possibly tomorrow. New spells coming in as part of 
Smed's individualization theme, and apparently something big happening with 
spells and combat arts. Moorgard warned everyone that ALL existing spells 
would revert to Apprentice I. This means that all those poor shmucks who 
laid out their life savings to buy an Adept III are going to see it 
evaporate and turn back into an App I heh. Also going in is searching by 
artisan category, new artisan dependencies and -- finally -- Alchemy 
recipes.

What all this means for me is that starting tomorrow my character's life is 
going to get very interesting. He is currently the only Alchemist on the 
server and therefore the only player who can make the new inks that Sages 
will require in order to make the 20+ spells (tho I suspect there will be a 
lot of grinding tonight and others will emerge); everyone is going to want 
to try the new Alchemy poisons and potions; and EVERYONE on the server is 
going to need all new spell upgrades for their App I's so my spell making 
business for the 1-19 market is going to go through the roof. And with the 
new search now they can find me. :O
