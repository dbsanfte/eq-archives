One minor detail not mentioned by you or Tim Smith is that most motherboards
still have one jumper to set.  I forget what it was, but I had to set it on
my Athlon 1200 and my P3-700.

Nice thing is...if you buy the motherboard & CPU from a small local dealer
it's easy enough to ask them to help you with that jumper before you leave
the place.  If not, all you have to do is read the installation manual...the
one jumper had to do with CPU speed and it wasn't at all confusing.
