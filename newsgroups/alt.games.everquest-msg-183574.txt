How is it bullshit?  How do you know even 1% of what I do about being a monk
from 1 to 65, from Nro to PoH to vexthal?

How do you know even 1% of what James does about being a cleric from 1 to
65, from wherever to Vindi to RZtW?

Oh I know... because you read something on thesafehouse or Lucy!

I don't really care about the attitude.. I think you're a prick, you're more
than welcome to think the same of me, and probably already do.

How can you claim a level 20 who reads <insert EQ spoiler site> knows even
half of what a competent and hardcore level 65 cleric does is beyond me,
really is it.
