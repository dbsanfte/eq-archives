As a leadoff on this i would like to ask those who might know better.
As my Atheist Enchanter who is of the High Elven ancestry, grew up in the
Greater Faydark and killing
immense masses of Crushbone Orcs in his youth. Will he have faction problems
that will need corrections
later on in life for getting Tash coin and eventually the epic quest, or
will DE illusion and faction adjusting spells
be able to cover their hatred for me for killing their beloved allies the
Crushbone Orcs.

Also casting faction adjusting spells on one npc, does that only cover him
or does it automatically affect all in
the zone, or even several zones, for the duration of the spell?
