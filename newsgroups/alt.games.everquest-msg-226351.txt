Kill stuff, loot stuff, sell the loot for cash.

Applied with care this method will rapidly outpace any trade skill you 
can think of.

Exceptions: Make "subcombines", which other trade skillers can use to 
cut down on the massive tedium required to get to the final stage of the 
high level stuff.

For example, farm spiderling silks and animal pelts, cut the pelts down 
to LQ, and make Leather Padding.  People working on Blacksmithing need 
tons and tons of leather padding.

Oddly, they won't be able to sell the product they make from it for 
anything resembling a profit; no player wants it and the merchants won't 
pay more than the cost of matierials even if they farm the leather 
padding themselves; buying the padding from you is a complete loss.  But 
its such a time savings that its well worth it.

Selling to merchants is not supposed to be profitable; every time 
someone discovers a great method for manufacturing pp in this way, SOE 
comes in a while later and kills it, either dramatically increasing the 
costs or decreasing what the merchants will pay.  I'm sure there are 
still things like this out there, but people have learned not to mention 
them because once word gets out, it becomes so huge that SOE notices and 
comes down with the nerf bat again.
