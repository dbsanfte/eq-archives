The beastlord tutorial starts out with you being captured and being taken 
as a slave to work in a mine. You overpower a guard, grab a key, and help 
out the guy in the cell next to you. He gets you to the rebellion and then 
it starts. The first task is to talk to the leader of the rebellion, who 
then sends you to a bunch of people that walk you through the basic UI. You 
learn how to use Find, Maps, Swimming, Tradeskilling, Banking, Merchants, 
Weapons and Armor. One thing that would be nice is more info on the classes 
themselves. For example. I read on one of the sites (Caster's Realm or 
Alakhazam) that as a Beastlord I should just stick to my fists and work on 
Hand to Hand combat. But beyond that, it is pretty nice.
