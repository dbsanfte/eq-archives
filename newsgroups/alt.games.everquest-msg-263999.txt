know I will get questions from people wondering how to get to 
some old world zone to do part of some quest or another...I 
shouldn't have to answer *how* to get to Rathe Mountains from PoK 
when a froglok asks...

I love the new tutorial, but *damn* now people are going right 
from the tutorial to paludal and pretty much skipping the whole 
bewbie quest/home zone armor quests that teach you the immediate 
home zone and the hunting zones right next to the home zone.

I have a baby bard on test, 7th level and in the middle of the 
newbie armor quest. You know HOW many times I get baffled people 
asking why I dont testbuff!!!???!!! [all i need is 7 more bricks 
of crude iron ore, the 3 chieftain necklaces, 2 giant scarab 
brains, and the enlarged fire beetle leg=)] I even have 11 plat 
towards my next few songs=)
