It relates in that I strongly suspect that Briann's concerns are more
rooted in his personal anger at being taken than in actual outrage
over the act of lying. I think he's more interested in punishment
(read "revenge") than in protecting the reputation or members of his
guild.

I don't mean or intend to disparage Briann with this, by the way,
though I know it sounds like it - the reaction I'm attributing to him
is entirely human, and goddess knows I've felt it myself often enough.

Not at all. I'm saying that she isn't a saint. Neither, I'm sure, is
Briann. I'm certain you're not <g>, and I damn well know I'm not.

Who hasn't done the occasional rotten thing, even something entirely
out of character? Does that mean you judge a person entirely upon that
one incident, and ignore everything else about them? Or does it mean
you just keep an extra close watch on them awhile to see what they're
really made of?

Not at all. I think what my guild does is a good thing. But I
sincerely hope that no one in the guild is dumb enough to believe that
such a small sample of how a person acts is a decent indicator of if
they'll be a good member. And likewise, a single bad act is no proof
of a bad personality. Evidence, yes. Proof, no.

>know a damn thing about them?

Ah, now you're starting to talk about a more valid sample of what a
person is like. It's not based on one incident, but instead on
extended experience with them. And that's what I'm advising Briann
(and his guild) to do - give the person a chance, and maybe, just
maybe, she'll surprise them.
