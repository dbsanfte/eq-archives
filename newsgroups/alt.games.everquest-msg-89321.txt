    It has yet to be demonstrated that resources from non-Legends servers
have been siphoned off onto the Legends project. I agree that it stinks for
all of us on the $10 servers (and I like that phrase, "$10 server" so much
that I'm sticking with it), but I don't think you can draw the conclusion
yet.

    Why would it take a full programming team? By this point I imagine they
have zone-creation tools that can set up a zone using pre-existing textures
and models. By hiring a few people to be part-time GMs and part-time zone
builders I imagine they could accomplish making a new zone pretty quickly,
as long as it didn't have anything new or unique about it. You've seen the
pathing in the new zones - did it look like someone spent a lot of time on
it? I'm sure they need SOMEONE to program for Legends if only to set up the
zone-wide GM events they have planned, so they had to have budgetted in
people like that.

    The real issue is the fact that people are paying to be l33ter than
those of you on $10 servers that feel that your "hard work" should be
rewarded with the best EQ has to offer. Anything Legends does that gives
them something cool that you want, but can't have, will be attacked as
"diverting from production servers". Again, I think it stinks too - but I'm
not going to bother getting worked up about it. If it offended me that much,
I'd quit EQ.

    This is supposed to be some sort of shipwreck/desert island, right? They
could lift pretty much anything they needed to make it out of Timorous Deep.
Hell, they could put the island IN Timorous Deep and I'm sure nobody would
notice for a while.
