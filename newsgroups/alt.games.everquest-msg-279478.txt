On EMarr at the moment there are 11 buyers vs 400 sellers, which is
pretty typical.  I agree that I wouldn't have a buyer except that I
already had a second account, so I figured I might as well.  It's
worked out pretty well; if I'm patient I find I can often buy items
for well below the sellers' going rate.  Presumably this is because
eventually someone comes around who has the item and isn't interested
in setting up a bazaar mule to unload it.

It's possible that SOE really thinks that forcing buyers/sellers to
be separate encourages people to buy second accounts.  Given the low
number of buyers, they'd have to be wearing blinders to think that,
but hey, this is SOE we're talking about. :-)  On the other hand, it's
also possible that they might just not be sure how to implement it.
When you right-click on a combined buyer/seller, which window do you
get?  They'd have to design a whole new window that somehow combines
the customer views of buyers and sellers (maybe one window with tabs?).
The buyer feature is still relatively new; maybe they do intend to
combine them at some point but wanted to offer the functionality via
separate characters in the meantime.
