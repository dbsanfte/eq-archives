Money is not the key to happiness but lack of money is the quickest road to
being miserable I know of. Do you actually *enjoy* going to work in that
resturaunt Biz? If we take money out of the equation would you still turn up
everyday just because it is so fun?

Why haven't you quit then? Why not just go out and fulfill your ambition and
just open up that resturaunt of your own? Money?

Money is not the key to happiness, but I reckon if you traced back problems
to their source, then lack of it would account for 90%* of unhappiness
getting around.

*Personal opinion based on a figure I just plucked out of my ass without
half a moments thought.
