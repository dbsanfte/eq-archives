I've found that almost ALL of velious is BYOG.  Even as a cleric, I couldn't
find pickup groups easily (in velious.)  I was never at a loss for people
badgering me for a rez of course :)  But that's the downside to a cleric.

Yea, you are right about the "cleric can get away being low level and find a
group" business.  I think I was something like 32nd level and camping at the
orc fort in EW.  The centurians were mostly blue to me, but everything else
was deep red.  We still took it though.

In my opionion, this is a problem.  All too often, I see groups which are
WAY overpowered camp a zone for safe exp.  I've even grouped with some guild
members who were 55+ lvl and hunting drakes in skyfire mountains.  Hell, I
was 45th at the time, and I could SOLO almost everything in there, (and I'm
a cleric!)  Sad when you see such high level people hunt such low-level
mobs.

I played on Lanys, and I guess it's just a difference of servers.  Usually
there is either the LM, or the RM camped.  Not both.  There aren't enough
mobs to support two groups.  One group can easily handle all the mobs near
the entrance and swimming in the moat.

And I've been in groups where we've easily taken both the LCY and the RCY.

That leaves a tower group, and a basement group.

Anything more than 5 groups, and you've got people fighting for spawns.  All
the kill-steal accusations start flying, and it generaly gets ugly from that
point on.  (And then there are the people who intentionaly train the
entrance to get rid of all the extra people in the zone.)  KC on Lanys can
get absurd sometime.

I've tried so many times to take our group from KC over to Velks or Kael or
something like that.  But people just aren't willing to move to a new zone.
Oh well.  That's the "high level" life for ya.
