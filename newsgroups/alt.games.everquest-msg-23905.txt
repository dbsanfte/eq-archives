You will not evade me, "Lefty" <lefty@nospam.please>:

>"Sword of Shannara" by Terry Brooks

Not recommended for anyone who liked Lord of the Rings. Reading it was
almost painful, with all the ripoffs. Other books in the series are
more palatable than the first one, though.

Personally, my favorite sword and sorcery books are the "Sword and
Sorceress" series - I buy them whenever I can get my hands on them,
which is unfortunately not as often as I'd like :) The stories make
very nice reading material for trips and have gotten me through many
boring bus and plane rides.

Oh, and Terry Pratchett, if you like your fantasy literature with
humor :)
