That was my analagy, and you've gotten it bang on. The thing that still 
troubles me with the fraud argument, is that that I'm not convinced any 
court would agree that fraud has taken place if you refuse to pay after 
he hands you the boardwalk card.

1) No cash has actually exchanged hands.

2) Only an ephemeral 'in game' item has exchanged hands.

So where has the fraud occurred? In the 'real' world or in the 'game' 
world? Seeing as no real assets changed hands only game assets, I think 
the 'fraud' may have occurred in the game world... a place where it 
isn't illegal, only against the rules of the game. At which point the 
only recourse is to appeal to the game administrators, Sony, who are 
responsible for dealing with cheats, scammers, and other crap that 
occurs in the game.

After all if I sell you the North Karanas bridge for 50kpp can you sue 
me for fraud in the real world?? I think not.

However, Sony, may choose to do nothing, may choose to restore the plat, 
or may choose to ban both accounts, since *both* accounts are violating 
the eula, *and* have become a visible problem. So appealing to Sony 
isn't terribly useful.
