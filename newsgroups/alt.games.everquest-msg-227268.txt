No, I'm talking about experience groups.   Just seeing a real upgrade drop
is near impossible, as all of the good items tend to be rare drops on named
mobs that themselves are rare spawns.  (if it's not, it's generally
available in the bazaar for a song, so you already have it.)    If a mob
spawns once every half hour, and only spawns as a named 20% of the time...
and only 20% of those times will the named drop your upgrade... it takes a
very long time before you see your upgrade drop, assuming you're even
fighting in the correct camp.     Then you want to add in another
requirement.  That you must outroll every member of your group.  A 1 in 6
chance.

So if one out of every five spawns is the named, at a half hour apiece... on
average you will see the named once every 2 and a half hours.   One in five
named sightings and you will get the correct drop, so you're looking at 12.5
hours per upgrade dropping, on average.    In your group, you would then
have to win a 1 in 6 chance against your group members, so you would loot an
upgrade once every 75 hours, on average.


Once every 75 hours is not enough to "keep it interesting" for me.   So...
no, your statement is incorrect.

Heh.  My warrior has at least 4 different sets of weapons on him, depending
on what he needs to do at any particular moment.

Heh... maybe on FV, but on the normal servers in 99 percent of the cases,
you can't.   When you're talking about raid targets, just about everything
is no-drop.
