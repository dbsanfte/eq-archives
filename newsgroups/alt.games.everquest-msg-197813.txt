So, is your world black, or white?  Or perhaps you can grasp that there are
"games" like tic-tac-toe, and then there are the *vast* majority of games
with competition and conflict.  I wouldn't call most of them "war games" but
EQ comes closer to earning that moniker, particularly when one gets into the
quasi-militaristic "high end" part of the game.

Everyone is self-serving.  Those with intellectual and moral honesty admit
to it.  Then there are people like you.

You're a fucking idiot if you think that an anonymous toon in my guild is
*less* "human" than an anonymous neighbor two blocks away.  But to put it in
perspective, I'd not loan a guild member money, and I'd not loan a neighbor
money, but I'd call an ambulance if I saw either of them lying on the side
of the road.

You didn't.  I did.  Please try and keep up.

I was using an easily discernible type of person in my local community and
the comparison to an easily discernible and similar type of person in EQ.

By the way, you should be out giving all your money to anyone who has less. 
Sounds goofy doesn't it?  Yeah, that's how I look at your idiotic socialist
ramblings too.

Says the moron who has come to a conclusion that required leaps of logic
that would baffle a 4-dimensional rabbit.

I'll rise to the occasion.  So far, you don't warrant better.

By the way, considering the truly bizarre conclusions and arguments you
tender, I was being more than half-serious about you being off your meds. 
Seriously, it appears you need to stay on a strict regimen.
