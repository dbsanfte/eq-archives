I think somebody once posted that Swamp of No Hope is a good place to
hunt in your 20's?  What parts of the zone, what kind of mobs and what
are the general level of the mobs?  (I probably won't want to go to
Frogtown since it's easy to get ganged up on, not to mention the named
50+ druid epic mob that likes to show up there).

I just turned level 24, still finding blue mobs for experience by the
mudpit in the Overthere but probably will have to move on by level 25,
and hoping to find an alternative to Lake of Ill Manners.  Is Warsliks
Woods another alternative?  

Thanks in advance,
