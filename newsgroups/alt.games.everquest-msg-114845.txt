It seems a bit much for you to expect the OP to have such an in-depth
knowledge of internet architecture. This may be the first internet
based game the guy has ever played. The EQ box does not say anything
about understanding traceroute and propagatation delay in order to
play.

It's true that the guy's post reflected a fundamental lack of
knowledge about how the internet works, but is that sufficient reason
for you to rip him a new orifice? I don't think so. I certainly don't
expect to be ridiculed by a subject expert just because I don't know
everything about their area of knowledge.

The guy certainly has the right to say that his experience playing EQ
was poor.
