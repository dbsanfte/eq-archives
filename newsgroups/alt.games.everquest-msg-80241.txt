I have a question about these weapons also.  Someone gave me a velious spear
(I think thats the name) and it does ice damage at 25th level.  But for
regular use it only does 6 damage.  Is it worth hanging on to.  I've got a
long way to go to 25th level.  Once I get there will this weapon be worth
it?
