Yes I believe that all this exploit calling is stupid. If verant didnt like
the way thier mobs got killed then maybe they should change the way path,
aggro, and attack. Its only common sense if you dont want to be hit by a LOS
spell you get out of LOS thats not an exploit thats a strategy.

I know verant bitches about exploiting but I think that is BS.  I've seen
people killing guards in Highkeep because if they just sit in one area the
guards will step no farther to attack them. I guess that would called
exploiting, but I also believe it is a good strategy, little risk high
reward.

If verant wanted to stop stuff like that happening maybe they should improve
the whole pathing situation especially in dungeons and towns.
