No they exist because so many Americans can't stand Brits, French and
Germans they want them off of their servers....and the Brits, French and
Germans all now have a server each because can't stand each other either.
Although it could be a connectivity thing, I am not convinced.

Me? I play on Bristlebane, one of the most populated (and unstable) of the
US servers. This way, when I run into a moron, I can exercise my inherited
xenophobia and pass it off as being some "dumb ass, Yank" It's far easier to
deal with, that way, than when I know the dickhead I am just about to add to
/ignore is actually from the UK.

There are a lot of complaints from players on the Euro servers that the
patches interfere with their play times due to the time difference and "we"
should get them at 3am as well. This would mean we would get the patches
upto 8 hrs earlier than the US...Although I can sympathise with this train
of thought I do suspect that if this were to happen then we'd just hear
whines on how SOE test EQ Patches on Euro servers before making live on the
US ones.
