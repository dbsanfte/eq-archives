On a somewhat related topic :). Using hotkeys has helped cut down my
interrupts from moving as well. I drive with the mouse, so my right hand is
occupied - with the mouse :). The interval of time it takes to move my left
hand from the movement keys to the ALT-# keys is only a fraction of a
second, but is enough to prevent interrupts from occuring most of the time.
