Of course, they didn't have something that the WoW people do have:
Statistics and data from a whole host of other MMOG's out there, as
well as heavy input from players who are experienced in playing
MMOG's. Most likely also direct experience as players of MMOG's too.
Because others have done it first, they know what to expect. The fact
that they haven't made a MMOG before means little, really. The only
"paper tigers" are the arguments that their lack of experience in
making MMOG's means that it will automaticly or even very likely be a
failure.

EQ had none of that. Sure, it was a hugely rough start, but others
coming along later have their mistakes and the mistakes of all the
other MMOG's to learn from.
