Breeze (enc level 16) 35 mana
Clarity (enc level 29) 75 mana
Revive (cle level 29) 300 mana
Resuscitate (cle level 39) 500 mana
Resurrection (cle level 49) 700 mana
Clarity 2 (enc level 56) 115 mana
Reviviscence (cle level 56) 600 mana (yeah, cheaper than level 49)

Druid/Wizard group ports cost 300 mana (wizard TL 225 mana but may cost 2p
in reagent depending on destination).

Comparing casting breeze to anything tougher than sow is a bad comparison.
Since an enchanter (from level 16 on) always has a mana regen spell cast on
them, it makes it almost painless to cast either spell on as many folks as
you want.  You can probably Breeze 15-20 people (more?) on a full bar of
mana.  I don't think that a level 29 cleric can revive more than 4 or 5.
