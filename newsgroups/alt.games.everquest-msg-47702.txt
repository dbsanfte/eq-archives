Well, that would be an immensely incorrect assumption. Lots and lots of
things can see through a rogue sneak/hide. Most creatures that can see
through invis/ivu, for starters. If sneak/hide made rogues completely
invisible to everything, that would be GROSSLY overpowered. Sneak/Hide is
better than invis/ivu in many ways, but it does not confer complete
immunity to attack.

That's the thing...in the Hole in particular, you will often find things
that scowl through sneak/hide, but do not attack. I believe the only
creature in the Hole that will attack a brell worshipping halfling rogue
who is sneaking and hiding is Master Yael...the others will leave him alone
based on faction or sneaking.
