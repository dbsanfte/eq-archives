Doh, I'm an idiot. I read the story of the map of Piri Reis enough years 
ago to forget the specifics (and I didn't even read the link I myself 
supplied :).

You are right, it postdates Columbus by quite a few years, and the 
mistery of it is whether it actually shows Antarctica, although some 
skeptics point out it's a lot more likely to be Tierra del Fuego, drawn 
in the wrong place.
