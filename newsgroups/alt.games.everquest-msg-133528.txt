Agree. Wizards get it at my level, and I don't have it yet. And I likely
wont' get it. That's one ugly ass mob to have to take down for a chance
at it and people still want a fortune for it. I refuse to pay that kind
of money for not carrying bat wings, and I'm not dragging the guild out
on that sort of excursion for such a minor convenience, or just to be
able to say "I've got all the spells".  If it falls into my lap for free
or relatively cheaply down the line, sure, I'll take it. But I'm not
sinking any serious effort into it.

I'm busy trying to finish Seb and HS keys at the moment. Screw
Levitation.
