    Lord Seru was not done - the quest for the Arx key wasn't in game.
Cursed cycle was not done - the Cursed was flagged with two death touches to
make him unbeatable. Emperor in Ssra was not done - the door leading to the
entire area was unpickable until well after release, when the patch message
about the Emperor came out. Because Emperor was unfinished, and Emperor is a
required step in getting to Vex Thal, one could only assume that Vex Thal
was unfinished. Indeed, the lucid shards for the key to VT didn't start
dropping until well into the expansion as well.

    Playtesting was abyssmal. Easy mobs had godly loot that had to be nerfed
off of them, like that monk weapon and those sleeves that originally dropped
off THO. Encounters had massive bugs, like the multiple spawnings of Shei in
Akheva. Some areas, like Umbral Plains, weren't fully itemized yet. Other
mobs had junk drops for the difficulty - witness the mass buffing of Luclin
loots after release. Pathing in Sanctus Seru is so bad that Fear had to be
disabled to prevent risk-free fear kiting. The grimling war in Hollowshade
is still broken. Inner Acrylia was very poorly itemized, and has a massive
"Under Construction" sign hanging on it now. There was also the usual glut
of broken tradeskill recipes and quests. Oh, and The Bazaar didn't work. I'd
be stunned if there was a single zone in Luclin that has been working as
intended since release.

    The entire expansion was a great idea, but never really completed. Now
imagine what PoP will be like, with its artificial "ship before Xmas"
deadline.
