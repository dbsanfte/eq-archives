Well, the servers are down, i hear... let me tell you what happened in
Velious yesterday.

My barbarian Shaman - Sarcoma Rhabdos, Tunare - had been in City of Mist
since 35. Dinged 6 times there, and was quite tired of the extreme exp and
decent loot ,o) It was sooo boring to look at the same ol' mobs and the same
/shouts TRAIN TO ZONE !! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE. And to hear about the randoms on
GJB, Firerune Brand, WBH, Lost staff of the scorned etc. I lost rolls for
GJB, Lost staff OTS, 5 Hammers (!) but won rol on 2 Obsidian Ring of
Quintessence INT2, AC3, MANA10-rings (Unsellable !) But won roll on Firerune
Brand. My lvl 6 warrior are now wielding that in Gfaydark hehe. Well - i was
tired, and wanted to see some new scenery. Got a rez after my death, dinged
41 - and ported to Iceclad.

After rez i forgot to clean my corpse, so theres a Flawless Aquamarine and a
Split paw eye (? the one with the rightclickable : glimpse on it) placed on
the corpse laying at the zone... sigh. Ah well. I ported out and ran to Fort
in Eastern Wastes. Binded myself, and started a orc group. Orc fang earring
dropped - and warrior took it. THEN the group had to zone, because someone
killed chief, and the avengers spreaded death... I didnt die, but was
sitting in Crystal Caverns...

... I know that the cloak of the ry'gorr oracles drop there, so i /auctioned
for it... anyone selling ? And a monk told me that he maybe would be willing
to sell... He asked for offer, i asked for price - and he just wanted
10charge sow, and 10charge serpent sight... That was quite fair, actually
LOL. I couldnt wait to complete trade... I gave him potions and 50plat - and
he gave me the shiny white cloak, i had been /auctioned for, in weeks... Joy
and happiness. That was a very nice trade. And now he can go find himself a
new oracle that drop that... Earlier he couldnt loot the cloak, because of
lore... ouch. So he wanted to sell it, to be able to get some more hheeh.
Well i was happy.

Next step is that he tells me that there is a herbalists bag on the
herbalists corpse. i run down, and loot it. woot - my first Weight reduction
bag. 25%. Nice. And /kneel for the Monk.

Then i decide to solo a blue Herbalist (or whoever it was, cant remember) i
kill it with my extreme dots and piercing-skills and what does he drop ?
Correct - Crystal Covered Shroud LOL. I was so happy. it was my first
solo-kill (not counting Cougars) in Velious, and my first kill in CC - EVER.
/cheer.

Ah well - so to recap : Cloak of the rygorr oracles bought for around 200pp
in alchemy-cost. Afterwards, free 25% WR-bag. And then herba drops CCS ! And
the exp is decent to.

Right now the shaman is camped down at city. Love the music they plays in
that town, and now i just need some faction so i can buy-sell. How do i get
positive faction with the city in CC ? Someone please reply.

Well, that was a little story from Sarcoma's life... I love this game....
when its UP !
