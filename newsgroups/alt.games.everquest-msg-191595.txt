Why is paying real money for a game so bad? Don't you pay real money
for many other forms of entertainment?  If you buy lift tickets or
concert tickets etc, you don't have anything to show for your money
but you still dont' consider it a waste of money. If you enjoy playing
eq and spending real money to get fake money makes you happy I don't
see anything wrong with that. Thats as long as its your recreation
money and you arent spending your mortgage money on eq :)
