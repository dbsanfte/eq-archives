    Does anyone know any formulas for what the level damage bonus has become
since they changed it for high delay weapons? I remembered hearing they were
increasing it for weapons with a delay of 40+, and I just assumed any 40+
weapon would have the same bonus. At level 28, I use a Langsaxe of the
Wolves (19 44), and for the first swing I use a Weighted Axe (45 150).
Anyway, my magic number with the LoW has always been 38, but at level 28 it
became 42. As well, critical hits started getting reported as "You get a
critical hit!(90). You hit for 94 damage", or however it is actually
phrased.

    When I use the axe, however, things look very different. Firstly, the
magic number is 99, or 9 over the weapon rating. When I critical with it,
the damage bonus is 39 points. Here are a few sample axe criticals, (64)
103, (78) 117, (59) 98, and a mind blowing (110) 149.

    For some reason, the LoW has the same damage bonus whether it is a
regular or critical hit. The Axe however has a huge difference of 30 points.
I think the cause might be a level maximum. Most people know about the caps
of 10 damage from levels 1-10, and 14 from 11-20, perhaps there is a cap of
30 from 21-30. Because it is so high, if could easily be missed. The
weighted axe is Warrior only, large race only, and a pretty lousy dam/delay
ratio, and there aren't many other 30+ dam weapons, and very few of them in
the hands of players under level 30, so it could explain the discrepancy. A
cap of 30 makes the magic number 60, plus the 39 for the critical giving the
observed total of 99.

    Where there doesn't seem to be any link is between the bonus of four on
a 44 delay weapon and 39 on a delay 150 weapon. If the axe has a level
damage bonus this great at level 28, I can only imagine it is HUGE at very
high levels. Has anyone wielded one of these since the damage bonuses were
changed? Does anyone know a new formula for calculating level damage bonus?
I have looked through several web pages, but I can't find a definitive
answer, perhaps someone can help me out.

    Suden, 29 warrior.
