The guilt response is pretty much standard for that. Given history of
trolls on internet forums, I don't buy yours.

What makes you think I don't have a "fucking job" and don't earn what
I have? I didn't, however, have everything handed to me growing up. I
had to get a job as soon as I was old enough to help support my
family. I missed my chance at college and I can't afford to go and
still pay my cost of living. What I earn goes mostly toward the
necessary costs of supporting myself, my fiance, and her daughter.

Don't fucking assume that because someone can't afford to upgrade
their computer every year that they don't have a job. And don't assume
that if someone doesn't have a job that it's because they're lazy.
Because both of those only show that you're living under a rock.
