Jennai, I played pre-Kunark. I am quite familiar with 'the frustration'.
The 'good/safe/dependable' issues you mention were the result of 
SOE/Verant's poor implementation... nothing inherent in the 'boats' was 
such. In fact.. the boats were *supposed* to be good/safe/dependable.

There were also supposed to be a pain to underscore the porting power of 
druids & wizards... and give the world more breadth. North America and 
Europe *are* far apart... you don't land in New York from London and 
say... oops I forgot my favorite shirt... be right back.

Then they met their objective. They didn't think the population should 
be bopping around from end to end on a daily basis. Of course... at high 
levels with wizards/druids doing port duty... people were... and then 
the boats sort of became obsolete and ineffective... and SOE has *never* 
had them working properly, which hasn't helped their popularity either.

 From one perspective the mistake was giving druids and wizards such 
free ports. Personally I'd have made porting pricy... something you only 
did when you had to, and could afford to.

EQs success has largely been the result of its difficulty to progress. 
The boats were not a bad thing... except in there actual implementation.

I don't miss them either... but I honestly didn't take them that 
often... *because* they were a pain. Which meant they were working as 
intended ;)
