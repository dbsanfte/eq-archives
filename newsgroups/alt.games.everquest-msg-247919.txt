I was considering moving either my necro (at 53) or my rogue (at 63) to a
separate account so I can group the two.  Anyone had any experience with EQ
Windows?

Should I do this and decide I like how it works, does anyone have experience
with duel-boxing?  Which classes work well toghether?  I'm a fan of the
necro/rogue mix.  Warrior/cleric or warrior/shammy seem to work well.  Rumor
has it shammy/enchanter also works well.
