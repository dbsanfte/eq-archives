Two things I forgot to mention, which are a right pain in the arse.
I'm not sure if this is down to the N52 or the USB2 card I'm using,
but when I boot XP Pro with the N52 connected, it disables the
keyboard.  I then have to hit the power switch, unplug the N52 and
boot again.  Similarly, when the N52 is connected the caps lock light
stops working.  Caps lock itself works fine (just as well, as I have
it mapped to toggle targets), you just can't tell what state it's in.
