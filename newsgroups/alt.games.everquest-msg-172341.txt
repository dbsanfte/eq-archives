I've just been revealed that getting a bachelors degree or higher is the
mark of the beast. I think the recent emphasis on tatooing, store "rewards"
cards, the Sabbath being perverted are a decoy mark of the beast, or a
supplemental mark of the beast which will occur later, which is to say that
people who have tattoos could still be saved. Other potential marks of the
beast are having breast implants for women, as I believe that if you have
breast implants then you don't care about children or life. Autism is
probably caused by putting bags of toxic chemicals in your breasts and then
having the audacity to breast feed your children or bottle feeding them I
suppose is what would happen. The sad truth is that there is a naturally
provided method for breast enlargement called having children and breast
feeding them. The number 666 is some kind of name-number thing which I don't
know about, but changing the name from Rivera to Ribera is what made him the
antichrist.

The false prophet is all the traditional institutions that have normally
shaped people, education system, churches, which were perverted by the
antichrist who was inspired by Satan, including the internet and television
and movies.

I don't see why the internet, television and movies couldn't be used for
truly useful and entertaining purposes instead of to oppress and control
people.
