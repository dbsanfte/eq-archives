I 2-box a monk and cleric, or magician and cleric.  Either are incredibly
powerful and useful for raiding, but for exp grinding the lack of slow is a
real issue.  It wouldn't have been an issue at lower levels, but with all
three characters at level 65, I'm forced to either grind in zones that
people say "*need* slow" (and make my cleric wish he had perma-KEI and FT99)
or in zones that give crap experience.  Honestly, I haven't decided which
way actually works better yet.  :)

I also 2-box a lower level ranger and shaman, or ranger and wizard.  The
ranger/wizard combo is surprisingly good, and seems it has the potential to
remain good all the way to 65, but it requires a playstyle that is hell to
try and 2-box.
