Thanks for clearing that up. That was very informative. It also reminded 
me of another thing I didn't like about SWG - the major lack of variety 
where weapons and armor were concerned. There were only a few different 
viable options for any weapon type (pistols, carbines, rifles). I thought 
that was just a case of being light on content soon after launch, but it 
doesn't appear to be changing. You get a T21 less than halfway to master 
rifleman, and that's pretty much it. All you have to look forward to is 
the modifier increases.

Well, IMO, it should completely dwarf pistols at max range. That's what 
rifles are all about. By the same token, big penalties should be incurred 
at too close range.

Honestly, I always though creature handlers were *way* over-powered 
before. Some of those pets were just incredible in what they could dish 
out. Add to that the handler being a skilled pistoleer/carbineer, and it 
was so far out of balance that for power, you'd be crazy to even consider 
any other profession.

Wasn't the Krayt dragon supposedly the toughest mob in the game at one 
time? A CH friend of mine solo'ed them. Of course, that could have just 
as much to do with weak content as it did class imbalance...but I doubt 
it. :P
