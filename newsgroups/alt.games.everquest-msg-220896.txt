Level 10 and under, you reappear at your bind point with all your gear.

Level 11 and over, you reappear at your bind point in your underwear, while
all your gear is on your corpse, which is currently being stomped on by
whatever killed you.  Now you have to get back to where you died so you can
re-equip your gear.  You've got 1 week to do this.  If you wait more than
that, then your corpse will disintegrate and your on-corpse gear will be
lost forever.

Your bind point is the spot you reappear when you die, or when certain
spells are cast on you to send you there.  It starts out being in the newbie
fighting area of your home city.  Certain caster classes can later change
your bind point for you to other locations in other cities.  (If you're one
of these caster classes, you can later change your own bind point to most
anywhere you want.)
