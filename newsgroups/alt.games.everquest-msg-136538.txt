I was there on Torv!

As stated in the original post, this event was advertised with a server-wide
message, so there was no missing it.

It was pretty obvious the invasion was going to come from Blackburrow, so
I sat my 54 Wizard there.  And, lo, lots of gnolls (Soothsayer Gnolls, for
one) spawned, ran towards the path, then north to Surefall.

"Aha!", thinks I, "These are con blue to my wizzie!  I can quad blues!"

I snag one with a snare, and nuke it.  Kaa-blam!

Its HP bar did not visibly move.

Oops.

So I ran back to Surefall to get some help, and...

You will not evade me.... !
You have been summoned!

Urk.  bash.  Nuke.  Ick.  RUN!  RUN!  RUN!

I managed to zone out of there, and decided they could not be soloed. ;)

Tris.
