I presume you ran the patcher from the desktop shortcut? You probably
need to update the shortcut to point at the proper directory.

AFAIK, the patcher and game execute programs are supposed to be in the
EQ directory and do not use anything like an INI file to direct it to
use a different directory. That being said, if the directory was in
Documents and Settings it should have worked if it worked before. I am
mystified as to why your D and S directory version lost those other
files and became unrunnable.
