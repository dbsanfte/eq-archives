He ISN'T 100% MR, but he's a dragon, so you have to be in melee range
to get spells to stick. And you need Vox-raid resists, or else the
AoE and the dragonroar WILL end the encounter.

Me and some friends tried taking him down with
50 cleric
51 paladin
52 enchanter
41 druid
41 bard
and another enchanter, can't remember his level.

If we had replaced an enchanter with a warrior or something, we would
have succeded too. At least, if the druid hadn't decided to follow the
pulling paladin and picked up the mother of all trains... Druid died
before the dragon was engaged, sigh... We had like 3 drakes and a
horsie on us in addition to the BR, still we managed to take him below
half, even if the enchanters didn't go into melee range to nuke...

Rune, oh well, I'm a snack for the BR again, sigh...
