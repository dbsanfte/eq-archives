I don't believe there is any reason for the guild to worry about faction 
alignments of their members when the guild is primarilly hitting PoP 
mobs.  Once the guild gets to the elemental and higher level, they are 
not worrying about Velious quest items or Luclin quest items.  Most 
anything they could possibly need can be purchased in PoK, or the bazaar.

If you will be joining them, don't expect to be doing Velious quests, far 
better stuff drops or is made from drops in elemental plus zones.
