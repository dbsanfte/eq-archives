On my cable connection it took about 10-15 minutes.
A dialup user should expect a few hours, but nothing
unreasonable.

I spent 30+ hours downloading the WoW beta - that was
unreasonable. Worse part is...I only played it for about
10 hours before deciding I didn't like it. I am finding
EQ2 much more enjoyable - and I plan on subscribing.
