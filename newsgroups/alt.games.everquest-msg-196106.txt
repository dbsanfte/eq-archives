While this is true, its also true that ShowEQ users are the ones that discovered many of the
(Lies?  Errors?) in what we were told about how the game actually works, and its user response to
those facts discovered by those users that lead to many of the positive changes in the game.

Whether they knew it didn't work the way they said, or whether they had some hidden motive for
misstating the way it worked, we'll never know.  But without the data in hand, it was hard to argue
for change.

Does it make sense to endorse cheating for the sake of discovering lies or ignorance?  Perhaps
not.  Was ShowEQ designed to permit cheating, or is that an abuse some put it to?  Again,
questionable area.

Certainly -some- EQ functions permitted -some- users to cheat the system.  Thats a pity.  Would
sure be nice if a safer version of the program (or a similar utility) was in place though to help
us answer questions about the experience system and the combat system and so forth.
