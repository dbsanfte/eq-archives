Have to go along with this.For my part I felt UO and EQ were believable. 
DAoC I felt was a little small. But then maybe I didn't give it a 
chance. I'm currently back with EQ and possibly enjoying it the most of 
any of my previous (2) excursions.

If anyone has played SWG in here would they say the world was believable 
in the same way? I didn't feel the beta was but it has most likely 
improved.
