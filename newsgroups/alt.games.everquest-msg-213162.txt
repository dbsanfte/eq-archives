   Another story about a mom letting a kid bake to death in a car, this
time because of "her addiction to Everquest".  The story had a decidedly
"evils of on-line gaming" tone to it.  There was a huge thread about
this on the SOE's forum not to long ago.  I guess I could find the link
if anyone really cares.  Basically, though, most everyone took the "the
mom was an idiot" stance, with one or two who maintained that everyone
one else was sick for defending EQ rather than being crushed by the
death of a child.

    Not sure why the media is so hot to paint the game with the color of
evil, but there it is.
