From what I've seen, most 'family guilds' can't raid high-Luclin. VT?
Emp? Ya right. Not even close.. how about lower in somewhat 'open'
areas.. Cursed? HP? Even Velious.. AoW? A lot of them have trouble
there too. Don't even mention ST or VP.. they might be able to do HoT
but NToV often tends to be beyond them. Taking the trash mobs from
each expansion doesn't mean progression. A 'family guild' usually ends
up centering around some content they can do. Say BoTtowers.. they do
it to get people gear and as the people get gear they leave for the
raiding guild. Back to getting new people who don't have the BoT tower
gear... keep raiding them. This cycle can go on ad infinatum and i've
seen it span years. Everybody comments how they came up in that guild,
and it certainly has its place.. but the people do not progress until
they leave or a new expansion comes out they can bottomfeed for gear
better than they currently have.

The main thing missing is that the people with the ability to lead
raids go to raiding guilds or start open raids.. as does the tactics,
strategy, and ability to pull people together to accomplish a task in
the way it is supposed to be done.

And I would completely agree. You know if you can group or not in a
raiding guild.

The GIGO i was referring to was his attitude towards raiding... that
nobody could tell him what to do and how to do it and what not. That's
the garbage in.. and he only gets garbage out as a result. Per the
group member leaving.. yeah he's a retard for taking a group when
raids are coming up.

Duh.. you misinterpreted my comment and thought it applied to the
group member who left.. i was referring to the responders attitude
towards his personal guild participation.

Once again.. two seperate things for which you got the arguments
crossed.

Well.. per that.. there are few things in RL that don't have a
master/slave relationship to them. Landlord/renter...
supervisor/worker... 

Husband/wife :>. Oboy that one was too funny not to share.
