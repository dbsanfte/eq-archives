I strongly disagree. That information is already on the box. And if I 
know enough to know the task system exists that is probably what I 
already know.

This is what =I= would want to know about the task system:

Is it -really- solable or just bards and necros? What about rogues?

What are the rewards? XP? Items? Plat? Adventure Points?

How good is the XP?

What are the 'tasks' like? Example?

How long does a task take to complete? Is there a timer?

Can I log out during a task and resume it when I log back in? Does the 
timer keep rolling (if there is a timer)?

Can a group do tasks?

Is it worth buying OoW to get the task system?


Those are the questions that are *frequently asked* about the task 
system. I **HATE** reading a FAQ that's just a rehash of whats on the 
box.

This is a community faq. It should reflect the consensus of the 
community. The reason people read a usenet faq is to see if the question 
they are about to post has already been answered.

The FAQ should anticipate questions that will be asked, and provide the 
answer they would get if they did ask. Minus the flames, ridicule, and 
incorrect responses of course ;)

At any rate, opinion and editorial are fine in a community FAQ, as long 
as they don't deviate too far from what the community thinks.

If you want trim the FAQ down a bit:
Lose the system requirements section, and refer to EQLives page on the 
subject, they keep it up to date so you don't have to. :)
