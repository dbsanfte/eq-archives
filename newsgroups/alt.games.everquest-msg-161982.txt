So what does this have to do with nerfing?  Druids can still gate, they just
can't make as much  money at it as before.  A nerf is taking away or
reducing an ability.  Druids have not been nerfed, they have just been made
more likable.

Just the fact that a monk can FD makes him/her a better soloer than a
warrior.  Monks can split MOBs much better, a very important part of soloing
and if things go bad FD saves the day.  Warriors don't have that option.
