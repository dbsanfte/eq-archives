Get yourself an:
Iksar ceremonial Breastplate,4k 
SilverChitin handwraps,2.5k
Bracelt of the spiritcharmer,0.5k
Leggings of the spiritcharmer,0.5k

You got nice weapons,good enough up to 45(or even higher)switch
out one of the swords for a jade mace,later there is a very nice
1hblunt(Copper hammer hammer of striking) cheap available.
Up to level 17 you can not dual wield,so use this time to train
at least 2h slash,very cheap 2h slash is silver swift blade,maybe
200p =),24 dly 16 dmg.

Rest of equipment doesnt matter much,I would save my money 
for real gear you want after 45.
Especially forget about archery,its not worth it even at level
54,where is my ranger now.
Buy a cheap bow for pulling,more than 150 range would be nice.
Oh and dont forget to buy your most important piece of equipment...
your sewing kit.  = )
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now lets start making real money  =)

Levels  1 to  4:
Hunt spiderlings and only spiderlings,(crypt in FoB or Feerott)
Keep the spiderling silks.

Levels  5 to 20:
Kill everything with 8 legs in FoB,sell the SPIDER silk(On my server
silk sells for 10p) and again keep the spiderling silk.

Levels 20 to 30:
Now it gets REALLY boring and monotonous,so be warned =)
Hunt  Greyhoppers in Marus Seru and nothing else.Best place is
at Sanctus Seru,for a while you dont need tracking ,hoppers 
are running parade in front of SS.  =)
Sell Greyhopper hides for 5p in Bazaar.Keep the LQ hides.
Time for some farming  SHADELING silk:
Head yourself  to Shadeweavers Thicket and farm Xakra Silkworms
and lesser shades for their silk until you have twice as much silks
as lq hides.
Learn a little tailoring,enough for making leatherpaddings,look
for details how to do this cheap and fast at Eqtraders.com.
Its up to you when you start learning tailoring to make leather
paddings,but at level 30 its time for some (minor) updates IMHO.
Now you should have made around 10k at level 30,but it will
become better.  =)
Levels 30 to 41:
Stonebrunt Mountains !!!  *tempted to type more eclamation marks*
Hunt all the leopards and tigers there for their pelts,take your
spiderling silks from levels 1 to 20 and again make leatherpaddings,
HQ cat pelts you can sell for 15p in Bazaar,I wouldnt bother to cut 
them down twice,its not worth the effort.
Probably you will find yourself at level 41 with tons of cat pelts
and no spiderling silk left,go Feerott and farm for spiderling silk
or sell cat pelts in Bazaar.
By killing all the cat like mobs in SBM you will make the named
giants spawn,if you have a higher level alt,he can kill them and
with some luck get a 10 int leg piece,good leg pieces seem to be rare
so they go for 4k on my server.
Other thing to keep an eye on in SBM are the heretics,miniquest which
leads  to a minor haste item,price around 1.5k.
Look for details at Allakhazam.
42 and higher:
(Me,I spent 40 to 47 in DL  to proof I am NOT that antisocial)   =)
Up to level 41 it was only the prelude,money will ROLL from now.
Did I mention monotonous and boring before ?   =)
As a Ranger or Druid there is only one zone now - Jagged Pine Forest.
Griffawn-Griffon- Anaconda meat sells for 90p at my server - enough
said.

Final result for my level 54 ranger is,he is decked out in gear worth
around 120k and has 20k in bank.
