The expansions I listed are all the ones I had installed before my
break. I also turned all of the new models off except for elementals
and horses. As far as I can tell, nothing in my computer is
overheating.

Meanwhile I've already e-mailed technical support. I have been meaning
to try the live Customer Support chat on the EQ website, but I haven't
been home during the hours of operation.

I've been meaning to upgrade my computer for awhile now. I suppose
that now I could start with the graphics card. Any suggestions for
something that gives the most bang for your buck?
