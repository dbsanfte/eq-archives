Agreed. Paladin would be my 2nd choice (with ranger a close 3rd) for a
partner for my shaman.

Only problem with stuns is that they often get resisted when it
counts. You dark before a mob runs to have time to react in case of
resist, miss one stun and the mob might well be around a corner by the
time you get a 2nd chance. Paladins do have root, which often helps.

Those two usually aren't close. Given room to maneuver and not many
casters, a high lvl SK with an insta-click circlet of shadows can pull
things that will put even a monk to shame. Mainly because the SK can
always pick which mob he wants to get on a pull while the monk usually
has to take whichever one wanders off last.

You left out the best thing about a Paladin partner, 90% rez! It's
pretty much always faster just to take the pally rez and get back to
business than try to find a cleric.
