One of the scams that i have heard of is that folk ask you to put your stuff
in the trade window so they can see the stats ('cos you cannot by
right-clicking the player, you only see names of stuff) and then they step
back so that you drop the stuff on the floor, which they quickley pick up
and steal. So if you think they are dubious and they keep moving as you try
to trade, it's a scam.
