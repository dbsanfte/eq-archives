Your ATK "stat" is purely a display value.  It is not used in any "to
hit" or damage calculations.  Folks who have tested the effect of STR
on combat found zero change in the chance of scoring a hit with
increased STR, and a relatively small change in the damage done by
actual hits when compared to the change in STR.  Now if you can
increase your STR by a lot (for example the 134 from L51? Shaman)
you do get a noticeable increase in damage output, if you are able
to hit the mob to begin with.

Exactly.  A STR debuff will reduce a mob's damage output per hit, but
not much.  A reduction in the chance of a mob scoring a hit at all is
much better.  Remember, ATK is not a "stat", it is a number derived
from your stats and skills for display purposes, and the formula used
gives way too much credit to STR.

Your low level disease dot gets agro way out of line with its combat
effects.  When goofing around in DL I found that I had to Stun early
and often if I wanted to compete with an SK for agro, and until the
lo level Luclin stuns were added for Paladins the SK would usually
win the contest (Stuns have a long recast time).  Darkness (and
Druid/Ranger Snare) does not seem to garner as much agro.

The group effect is there, but to ATK, not AC.  Reading James' post
I finally realized why I've been both debuffed (when a mob cast on me)
and buffed (when a group member cast on a mob) by the L39 version of
this spell.  Hadn't thought very hard about it, but now it all makes
sense.
