And we saw how well that worked out....   My dwarf warrior still can't run up
stairs easily.

But they won't.   Even after two graphics engine updates, EQ1 still looks 5
years old.

And the graphics aren't the only thing which cause a new version to be
desireable.  Going to EQ2 allowed them to make all kinds of design changes
which were just not possible in EQ1, despite the fact that they were ruining
the game.  Almost all of EQ1's sacred cows were dragged behind the barn and
slaughtered.  (Gleefully I would imagine.)

Complete heal makes clerics the only "real" healers?  Gone.  All three priest
classes really are equal now.

/discipline defensive gives warriors a permanent tanking advantage over every
other class?  Gone.   Warriors and Crusaders now have different (and
presumably more equal) abilities.

75% slow spells mean you can't balance content so it's doable both with and
without slow?  Gone.   I haven't seen percentages posted yet, but 25% for the
earlier ones is the rumor... and I'd be shocked if any slow got above 40 or 50
percent at max level.

Massive mudflation which had everyone in max stat gear by the time they hit
the "Endgame" from 2 expansions ago?   Gone.   All items wiped and reset, and
the new replacements hopefully done in a more sane fashion.  (Can you honestly
imagine trying to get EQ1 players to agree to an equipment wipe?)

Charm spells overpowered to the point where a lone enchanter with a pet can
outdamage an entire group of DPS classes?   Gone.    (actually looking at my
spell list, I see Coersers get charm at 37.  I'm willing to bet its nerfed to
hell and back compared to EQ1 charm though.)

Players able to meditate during combat makes it near impossible to design a
"long" encounter where you risk running out of mana instead of all the
encounters being "hard" encounters, where someone has to die for the players
to lose.  Gone.  Sitting during combat doesn't matter.  You gain back hp /
mana at a very high rate out of combat, and an extremely low rate during
combat.
