Way back when EQ first started nobody really knew what any spells or tactics
did, and a lot of the fun was figuring this stuff out - do you have any idea
how long harmony went unknown, or people thought enchanters sucked and had
no conceivable role in a group?

Now EQ's mature perhaps putting in descriptions so new players arent quite so
disadvantaged would be wise, but at the time a lot of the joy of the game was
in this voyage of discovery. I hope the new batch preserve that trend.
