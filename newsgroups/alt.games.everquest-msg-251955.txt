I've noticed this a few times, but only in Shadeweavers. Could be travelling
across the zone, and whole chucks of the scenery go missing, even the ground
I'm standing on. Any mobs or buildings on that area are hidden too. It seems
random; sometimes it's close, sometimes far. Standing still and turning on
the spot can reveal/hide areas.

I'm using Windows 98se with a Radeon 7500. I have to disable DirectX before
I power off, and re-enable it when I turn the pc back on again. It's the
only way I can get EQ to register the fact that I have a 3D card, as the ATI
drivers aren't recognised as being DX9 compliant.

It's all a dark plot by the men in the black vans and silent helicopters to
get me to upgrade to XP...
