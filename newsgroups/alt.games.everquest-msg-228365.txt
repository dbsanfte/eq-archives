I assume next you'll educate me about how CH will fill up my hitpoints...

Your point is that you will arbitrarily limit yourself and not take
advantage of situational things.  Great point.

I'm gonna help you out with a little "Reading 101".

"we always have been and always will be the best at "splitting", it's more
a matter of time spent"

is the equivalent of what you quoted:

"Sure, if you absolutely must have that mob single pulled for some weird
reason, and you can't move people away so you have a large area to work
with, and you don't care about the loss of dps while the monk is spending
his time waiting for resets - a monk is great."

"For any xp group encounter, a good bard using his abilities can easily
equal or better the monk due to being faster" (thus making it a matter of
time spent).

Now that it's been spelled out using your own quotes, you done explaining
feign pulling to the guy that will personally guarantee he can outpull
*you*?  :P
