This would be your problem.

Peridot cost around 11pp each (slightly less actually, but lets
round up)

DOTs to cast Aego on an entire group assuming you don't have BOA
cost 66pp.

ONE GEM in most PoP areas will sell for that much.  Assuming no
deaths, its taken care of by giving the cleric the first drop, if
you must deal with it via some share of the gems.

Another plan is simply to hand the cleric a peridot of your own
each time he buffs you (this would take care of deaths nicely) or
to use ML, sell all loot, hand the cleric whatever he says his
gem expenditure is, and then split the remainder.

With BOA or HOV, the cost drops still further, to 44pp per group,
by the way.

If you've been taken in by the "all gems go to cleric" scam all
the way to 65, you really must be travelling in some bad company,
thats a LOT of dishonest clerics and foolish group leaders under
the bridge.
