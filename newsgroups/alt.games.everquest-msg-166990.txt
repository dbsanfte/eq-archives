    The way to compute your "flowing thought and equivalent" mana regen is
as follows: take all mana regen effects you have. Subtract all mana regen
from buffs, and from Mental Clarity. That's the number that cannot go over
15. So, for example, the 8 points of mana regen on the Aten neckpiece counts
towards the cap, but the five point self-buff off the shoulders from Emperor
does not count.

    The old effect on the eighth shawl was not a buff, so it counted towards
the FT cap. I imagine it was changed to an explicit FT amount so people
would know that it counted. I guess by the time you get an Aten neck you're
expected to know such things. ;-)
