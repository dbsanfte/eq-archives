	As if I believe *anything* online, in Everquest or any
other venue, as "real" :-)

	Here's my take on it:  when I deal with on line people I 
take them at face value ***as on line people***.  This has the
double advantage of making the necessary suspension of disbelief
that much easier to achieve, and protecting me from the "You're not
really a 21 year old Playboy model who loves fat old men???"  syndrome.

	So rather than confusing the two I draw an utter and 
absolute distinction, treating them as the two very seperate worlds that
they are.
