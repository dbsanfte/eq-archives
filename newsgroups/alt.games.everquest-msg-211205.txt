In the same thread we've had the viewpoints that:

  a) If you 'hide' the truth you're deceiving people and they are naturally
     going to be angry at being lied to. Be proud of who you are, tough
     out any insults and harassment that spoil your hobby, and deal with it.

  b) If you bring up the truth you're revealing sordid secrets that should
     remain private and you're asking for trouble really, why do you feel
     the need to constantly advertise your difference and force it on me
     during my playtime?

Nobody is happy whichever of these mutually exclusive approaches you take.

This is why some people look for forums, guilds, clubs, friends, associates,
or whatever you want to call it where they know beforehand it simply wont
be an issue. Engaging in a political statement every time you try and enjoy
a hobby gets old fast. Knowing you're not going to have to either bite your
tongue over something you believe in or get involved in a shitstorm defending
it beforehand can be quite a relief.

So nyah. ;)
