Actually thats not the part I have any complaint about (lets you know who is
admiring your equipment...and prepairs you for answering questions,
conversation, or d00d sp3ak/beggers).

This is helpful, though I'd much rather have ability to NOT inspect within a
certain range of a merchant (because there are times I do inspect someone,
and would rather not have to keep changing it).  Though this would be nice
in crowded groups when looting.

Like the people who tell you about how life is nothing but problems and
let-downs...but have to put their lessons on life speech on hold every 5-10
minutes because their whisky glass is empty and needs a refill, then wonder
why you don't expect allot of problems but can understand why they have so
many (this actually happened, one of the about 3 times I actually tried
Yahoo games as a way to play cards with another human rather than
computer...and really the main reason I quit as well).
