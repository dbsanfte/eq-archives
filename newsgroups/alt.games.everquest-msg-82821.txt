Oh, sorry, I should have clarified.  A named spawn is basically a monster
with a proper unique name that sets him apart from the regular monsters.
Sebilis is a dungeon crawling with Frogloks (Frog People).  They have names
like a froglok krup knight or a froglok jin knight that are both static
spawns and moble spawns (they wander around the dungeon).  Every once in
awhile, at certain pre determined spawn points, a named monster will spawn.
Named monsters are usually tougher than the average monster, and they
usually have some kind of nice loot.  So, most people will set up camp at
the named spawns, killing various static spawned monsters and moble monsters
while they wait for the named to spawn.  The named doesn't always spawn.
Sometimes they have Place Holders.  You kill the place holder and wait the
spawn cylce, I think 30 minutes in Sebilis, and hope the named spawns then.
This is not to say only good loot drops off the named monsters, the average
monsters can drop nice items too, it's just rarer.  Anyway, I hope this is
clear =)
