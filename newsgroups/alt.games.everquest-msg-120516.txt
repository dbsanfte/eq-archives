The pet changes are awesome. My 8 necro was quite displeased to rise
from medding high on the hillside in EC and not see his pet anywhere.
Upon heading toward the tunnel to NRO, hoping to find the pet along
the way, he happened to notice the *entire* Orc 1 camp bearing down on
him from afar. Luckily, he made it to the Inn 2 guard and was able to
weather the storm until the guard killed most and scared the rest off.
