Are you saying, it actually depends on the circumstances, then?

Man, aren't you turning out to be quite the moral relativist, after all. :)

Not so many years ago, women wearing trousers was considered highly 
offensive too. The fact that it isn't offensive (at least to normal people) 
now it's due to women *not* waiting for attitudes to change, but instead 
taking the responsibility for change in their own hands, no matter who would 
take offense at the time.

As far as I'm concerned, what is right is more important than what does not 
offend. Of course, not everybody agrees, and that's the reason Salman 
Rushdie has to travel with a paper bag over his head.
