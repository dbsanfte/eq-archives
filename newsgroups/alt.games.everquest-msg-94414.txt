Well, if we want to get paranoid, consider this.  Verant doesn't seem to
be concerned much about ShowEQ.  They used to at least occasionally
change the encryption and break ShowEQ for up to a week or two.  The
only serious anti-ShowEQ change Verant has made in a long time was a few
months ago, when they changed the way faction is reported.  Before, the
way faction worked was the server sent to the client your numerical
faction value, and the client translated that to the appropriate faction
level.  This let you, say, con a Coldain guard, see your faction was at
-500, kill a giant, con the guard again, and see that it was now at
-495, so you would know that you would need 99 more giants to get to
indifferent with the guard.

Now consider some of the other things ShowEQ can do.  It turns out that
the client filters certain characters off of mob names.  The actual mob
names sometimes have things like '#' on the front of their name.  In
many zones, the placeholders are marked that way.  In ToFS, for example,
someone with ShowEQ can tell exactly which of 20 seemingly identical
mobs is the placeholder for the mob that drops the key to the next
level, because it will have its name marked.

If you wanted to be paranoid, you might ask that of all the things
ShowEQ allows...why is getting exact faction levels the only one they
have bothered to prevent over the last several months?  I don't see how
knowing exact faction levels hurts anything...in fact, if it is
generally known, I think it makes the game more enjoyable.  Generally,
people feel better if they can set definite goals and see progress.
Imagine what it would be like, for example, if you had no experience
indicator...you just killed and killed, and occasionaly were surprised
with a "ding".  Hell levels would be a lot more hellish!

To a paranoid person, clearly breaking ShowEQ's faction reporting is in
preparation for some faction change they want to keep secret.
