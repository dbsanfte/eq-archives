--- snipped a lot ---

I left EQ1 for EQ2 - had fun for awhile but found it both too easy and too 
lonely. The decision in EQ2 so segragate evil and good hurts the game I 
think. And the hand holding just ticked me off - let me make my own 
mistakes. The death penalty is a joke.

Ive recently gone back to EQ1 ( Quellious Server ) and found the game alive 
and well, at least on my server. I wont try another game till Vanguard goes 
beta ( if I get in ) or live. Till then I agree completely with Loral - EQ1 
is alive and, while maybe smaller, well.
