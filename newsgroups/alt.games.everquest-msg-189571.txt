Whew, that brings back some memories from summer '99. My first char was
a barbarian warrior. Some of my favorite EQ memories are being a newbie
in EF, mammoth/orc hunting on the frozen river. Interestingly enough,
that first hill across from Bandl was always called 2 Trees from the
beginning on my server. 

We were such newbies back then, we didn't have a clue. And our groups
were generally comprised of 2 warriors and 4 shaman (most of whom, as
you saw, thought they were tank-mages; heck, I guess level 15 and below
they kinda were). We used to run to the old Splitpaw from EF. Wow, were
those corpse runs fun...

It always makes me a little sad nowadays when I stop by EF and it's
deserted (like most of the other old world zones). That's great that you
found not one, but 4 real newbies. Good job teaching them the ropes on
grouping.

By the way, your druid root spells are called "grasping roots" or
something close ;)
