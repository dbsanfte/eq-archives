no, Im sorry, I tend to write like I think (hence all the ...... )  in
that window, its not the FD that gets ignored... its that the memwipe
didnt occure from the FD...   when you get up from the FD the mob
remembers you....

Now, Im not sure about when / where the check is done or if its done
more than once.  From all the threads I have read, it it pretty much
agreed on that mobs that can remember you, only have an approx 5%
chance to remember you after they get to spawn spot, whereas before
returning to spawn the percent chance is MUCH greater... lets say 60%
+ (just a number out of my head).

not true my friend... I did say approximatley 30 so safe in my
vagueness....  And I beg to differ on the fact I was the first to
refer to that aspect:

in my eyes this was a reference to what I was talking about... though
I assumed there was a mix up on the terms used... as in "see through"
I took to mean remember you..  because as you have stated there are
not any mobs that "see through" an FD (well cept the one you
mentioned).   Now quite obviously that is not what they said, but eh,
I have a tendancy to read into what people say..

not everyone is as transparent and clear as you are (I am refering to
your deft skills in writing and communication).  

good to have ya keeping me on me toes
