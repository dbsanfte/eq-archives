Question being, if you can reply to Claiming Caves, why can't you reply to Camp
Check?  Further, since you are replying to it, whats the problem?  Thats why its
being mentioned, to give you another chance to respond.  How about a hot key
"/ooc caves camped" if typing it out in midcombat is too hard.

I fully understand the difficulties inherant in the player made camp check plan,
but not the rancor that some people attach to the process.  Its a nicety only,
allowing reasonable sharing of a zone with a lot of running around for no
reason, and allowing people to hold "camps" that are easy enough that they are
actually doing several of them at a time, without having people come in and
swipe one or the other portions willy nilly, leading to full mana full health
down time.

Everyone benefits, but they do so only because everyone is being civilized about
it.   So where's the rage come in?
