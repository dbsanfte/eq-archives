EQ has actually helped me with my Arachnophobia...
I'd suggest exploring this Swimming fear more on EQ... - Safe places are all
over.. fountains, pools, lakes sometimes... etc., - Or go to Halas for a
bit.. Good XP critters, decent money, and every time you go to the bank you
have to swim across a small lake that has nothing in it. - Or wait for the
little raft. - everyone swims. ;)
