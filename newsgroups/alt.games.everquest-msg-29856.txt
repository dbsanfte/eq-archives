Its not a bug , the problem is that people refer to it as clearing hate
list, atone , just like enchanter spells that do that are a Memory wipe,
having a side effect of removeing u from the hate list....

But the mob basically forgets every thing that just happend.... like who was
on the hate list, or who did what dmg
