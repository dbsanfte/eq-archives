Not only you, I have had the problem since the patch prior to LDoN. It
just became more severe afterwards. I haven't been playing very long, so
absolutely nothing has changed on my system since installing EQ. A few
days ago, I almost canceled my account as I went LD on every single zone
attempt. I spent more time rebooting my system than playing.

My only consolation is that at my current character levels, I can gain
several levels without zoning.
