Nah, what I'm saying is he's a really easy kill for 6-12 high levellers,
especially if they have a couple of manaburning wizards with them. He's
usually killed pretty quickly after spawning for his loot, then he's
gone for 7 (?) days.

If your server has an open serverwide chat channel like auction or taxi,
ask on there, else port to CS or IC, run there invis, and try to track
him and ask people in the zone if they've seen a big dragon hanging
around the portal.
