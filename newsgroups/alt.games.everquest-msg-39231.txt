If you watch a lot of subtitled stuff, you pretty much stop noticing
you're even reading, especially if the subtitling is well done. I
suspect that American subtitling is of pretty low quality, since your
movies and TV broadcasts haven't depended on them the way many other
countries have, and since dubbing has been preferred (I actually once
heard that it's preferred because it'd be too demanding on people to
make them read the dialogue instead)
And white lettering on grey background: Everquest, with transparent
polygons turned off. The letters are easy to read without beeing too
intrusive (black would be bad) and the grey behind them means they can
be read even in a documentary about a snowstorm or against a spangled
background.
