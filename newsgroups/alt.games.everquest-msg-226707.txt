I've played various female characters through the 4.5 or so years I've
been playing EQ. I run into idiots occasionally, but it's pretty rare.
I suppose I've just been lucky, though.

He especially wouldn't be playing with that name still if his name
appeared in a petition about harassment. The GMs likely added another
warning for the name and nerfed it along with the warning for
harassment... (Drug references are one of the "big 2" naming rules
that can get you warned, suspended, or, in extreme cases (such as
people naming themselves "Osamabinladen" and such after 9/11) banned.
Generally, these guidelines cover names that would be considered
blatantly offensive by most people).
