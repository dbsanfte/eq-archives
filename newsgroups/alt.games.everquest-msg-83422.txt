Here's the rub... There are no naming rules, only guidelines subject to 
final judgement by the GMs. Therefore, when someone petitions a name, 
they don't change it, they bring it to the attention of the GMs so they 
can check whether they comply with the guidelines. I presume a name can 
be copyrighted or trademarked and yet be obscure enough to be considered 
in compliance with the guidelines.
