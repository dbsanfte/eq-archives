One thing they didn't mention that you can look forward to (I know, because
what you are seeing now on Prexus happened a couple years or so ago on The
Nameless).  Since the restore from backup will bring back deleted
characters, you might end up with name conflicts.

E.g., suppose someone made "Soandso" a year ago and deleted him.  You came
along later and made "Soandso".  When they restore, if they restore the
deleted "Soandso" first, that one gets the name, and yours will be changed
to "Soandsox".  If they handle it like they did on The Nameless, you can
petition for a name change if you don't like the new name, *but* they will
not be able to change it back to "Soandso" as long as that older "Soandso"
is still around.

Oh, I'm also curious as to whether guilds will be screwed up.  When The
Nameless was restored, guilds were intact, but their names were not.
Everyone's guild tag was empty.  Guild chat went to the right people, so
guild numbers were correct...the backup simply didn't include the names of
the guilds.  They had no procedure for fixing that, so they disbanded all
guilds, requiring them to reform.  I seem to recall that led to the expected
problems of jokers trying to grab the names of major guilds, and stuff like
that.
