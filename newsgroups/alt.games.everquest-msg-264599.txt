Rumble, that post was not from me. It's from my stalker, Reg LeCrisp, who 
has recently started posting inane messages and duplicating my sig and 
headers. I would like to think that most people will recognize the 
difference between a post that I write and one that he manufacturers, but 
you're not the only one so far who's been fooled. Be on the lookout. ;-)
