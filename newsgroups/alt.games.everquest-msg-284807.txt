Its evaluated per swing, there is no cap, you can see several procs 
fairly close together (I think there may be a minimum delay between 
procs but I'm not sure about that one), or none at all for a while.

BUT

What you have instead is apparantly a chance of proc per swing that is 
based on your current swing speed.

Say you have a weapon with a delay of 40, and a proc that tends to go 
off once every 4 swings on average(25% chance of proc per swing).  Get a 
haste item and buff combo that gets you swinging every 2 seconds, the 
chance of a proc per swing will drop to 12.5%.  Get slowed to where 
you're swinging once every 8 seconds, and your chance of proccing each 
swing will actually raise to 50%.

I've heard of a strategy where an AOE proccing weapon weilder is 
deliberately slowed (and takes off his Haste gear) in order to raise his 
proc rate to 100%.  I'm not sure how that benefits him, though, 
actually, since proccing once a minute at 100% chance on his single 
swing isn't, in the long run, any better than proccing usually once a 
minute, sometimes twice, while swinging 20 times.

I can envision a strategy, though which relies on slow and removed haste 
item to force an early proc of a Slow proccing weapon, then remove the 
Slow with a cure disease and put the haste item back on to get DPS 
online.  Clumsy, but lacking a real slower in the group, it might be 
worthwhile save for one problem... the plan relies on having a slow 
caster to slow the proccing guy!

Perhaps there's some other proccing weapon which would be worth working 
with to get a 100% chance of proc at the beginning of a fight.  Tash, 
maybe?  Journeyman's walking stick or something like that.  Shaman 
slower could use this strategy to get a mob tashed with no enchanter in 
the group.

The Workers Slegemallet, the infamous OT hammer can be a pain, if you 
could raise its chance of proc to 100% on the first blow, you could use 
it to gate out by hitting a mob you don't even want to fight, or at 
least avoid those long annoying duels; one hit and you're gone.

I'll try to think of others.  But the thing is, unless the proc rate is 
pretty high, and the weapon delay already pretty low, getting the rate 
up to 100% will probably take more slow than anyone has in their spell 
book, almost certainly more slow than the relatively modest one provided 
by Torpor.
