I suggest you go read the WoW Beta forums in reference to the issue.

I would categorize anything that directly effects your character
build from the moment you start playing as a core feature. "Racial
traits" are something that differentiate the races beyond just the
animation and graphics. That seems like some information you'd like
available when you generate your character.

As far as just adding "flavor" - that could be true. However, the
undead racial traits (which have been implemented) are significant
enough to be classified as being more then just "flavor" (which is
a good thing, imho).

Also, I agree that all indications are that the game is in good shape
right now. I'm not disputing that.

The original post in the thread was about Blizzard's seeming change in
philosophy. In their past releases, they have always taken the approach
that they would not release it until its highly polished. In this instance,
it seems clear that they have an internal date at which it will go gold, and
they are frantically trying to get in the rest of the content that they had
originally planned.

Btw, I am not trying to sound like I'm anti-Blizzard. I intend to get WoW
as soon as it's out.
