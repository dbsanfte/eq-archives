Trying to remember where I was around those levels..

Velks!
Boats in Dulak (yeah, I know you don't want hotspots)
Giant Fort in FM (depending on how log in 50)
DSP zone in area of Maidens Eye
Zone in or zone out of Chardok

Someone may suggest Seb, but as a beastlord never did have much luck
solo'ing there.  Snare was sorely missed and always had issues with
runners getting me adds.

Somewhere in my 50s I started playing around in The Deep at zone in,
but might have been mid to later 50s.
