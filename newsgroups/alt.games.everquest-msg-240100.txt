From the shadows, the mysterious Reddoak
<Reddoak.13csym@erollisimarr-dot-com-forum.com> (if that IS his real
name) conspiratorially whispered:

They aren't all tough like that though. The ones in SolB and LG are
rough (and apparently Estrella in Kedge is the rowdiest of all), but
many of them are actually quite soloable even for much lower levels.
Their drops, however, reflect their considerable ease.

The best items seem to be the FFBSS mentioned by Reddoak, the fabled
Ishva robe from Paw, the Kobold Priest's breastplate, and the weapons
from Ghoul Executioner, Froglok King, and Warlord Skarlon. They all
come in somewhere a smidgeon under Ssra level loot.
