Is this a Druid-only thing or all DoTs?

Is the following true, as a Necro ( assuming a DoT on the Mob):

1) Mob is chasing me, 1/3 less damage
2) Mob is meleeing my pet, no reduction
3) Mob is feared, no reduction
4) Mob is meleeing me, no reduction

I had never heard about this reduction.  I guess it is there to nerf Druid
kiting, some, eh?
