    The problem is you have several guilds that are all willing to "put in
the time". And they're going to fight tooth and nail to get that spawn,
using every semi-legal trick in the book to screw everyone else out of the
spawn. Combine that with how easy it is to get to the point where you can
fight for the spawn, and you have one of the most unpleasant experiences in
all of EQ.

    Look at the Morel Thule list. When your turn is up, you're expected to
be there, waiting. If you don't kill the mob fast enough, you lose your
place and the next person is up. Nothing lazy about that. At least it
prevents the absolute stupidity of having a half dozen clerics staring at an
empty space, fingers twitching above the "GET HERE NOW" hotkey.

    Not on my server. You have a one in X chance, where X is the number of
clerics that were also watching it for the pop when the GM decided to do the
roll. You even get to roll against other clerics in your guild that need
their epics, unless your guild decides it only wants one "guild" chance.
Loot awards? GMs do that on this spawn, not officers or DKPs!

    My server doesn't have a list. We have first in force, combined with
mandatory rolls by a GM if there's a conflict (and there always is). At this
point I'd prefer a list just so I could plan my online time accordingly,
even if I was placed near the bottom of that list.
