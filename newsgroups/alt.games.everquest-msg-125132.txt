Sorry to be dull, but I agree.  Dark Elves are simply the coolest, most 
gorgeous race in the game - if I say so myself.  :o)

Not only that, but as you say, they're dwellers in the dark, and I reckon 
they're by far the most handy if you're non-social like me and prefer to 
stay out of the way and let the world roll by...
