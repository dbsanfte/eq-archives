No, only a select few too dense to know the difference between
Teir'dal and Drow. Drow are a specific "brand name" of dark elf that
only exists in TSR's (Now WotC's) little (Frankly, asanine and
idiotic) system.

Everquest is a computerized ROLE PLAYING GAME. You may as well lump
all RPGs as being "NOthing more than AD&D". Beleive it or not, AD&D
did not invent role-playing or fantasy creatures. 

I'm sorry, the above statement from you is so pinheaded it's rather
pathetic. "Nothing more than computerized AD&D"? Gee, well, I guess
the glaring differences in the world's back story, the combat and
magic systems, and so forth don't mean jack shit. Open your eyes.

I bet you think AD&D invented Halflings, too, don't you?
