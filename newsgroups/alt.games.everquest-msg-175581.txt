My point is based on more than just "opinion". It is a fact that most
players will buy the game to play a Jedi. It is a fact that SOE has
announced that becoming a Jedi will be extremely hard and the class
will be rare.

What is "unknown" is whether or not SWG will have enough content
(other options) to keep people happy and playing after they realize
that most players will never achieve the goal they wanted when they
purchased the game.

I never said the game would "suck". I merely pointed out the flaws in
the premise. It would be no different if SOE put out a "James Bond"
game, and then told players that only a few lucky ones could become
"00" agents (or super villains) while the rest would have to play
police, soldiers, merchants/gadget makers ("Q"), or henchmen.

>I'll come back and post on this board saying, "Khosh was right, the game was lame!" 

I don't want to be right. I just refuse to put on blinders and ignore
the issues that are most likely to come up.

>If I really like it, and it turns out to be badass, then I'll come back and tell you how wrong you were

You won't have to, because I will be playing SWG just like you if they
pull it off. I don't want SWG to fail, and I look forward to trying it
out. Nothing would please me more than to find out that my fears and
predictions are completly wrong.
