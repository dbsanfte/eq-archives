I have no idea how they know, I just know that in the information they give
about transferring characters they say that you must be the original owner
of both accounts.  Maybe they keep records of all the name and billing
information associated with every key-code.  I also called tech support
(yes, I actually spoke to a human-I think) who told me that the previous
ownership would be the problem.  He told me to go ahead and submit the
request, but it would probably be turned down.
