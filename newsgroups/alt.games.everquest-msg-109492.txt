Don't think so. It uses the same engine as the current game. "The
luclin graphics" are only how you display player characters, which
really has no effect on the rest of the game (just as it does not in
luclin) As per usual, you'll have the option to turn off luclin models
just as many people do now for guild raids.

They stated its the same ol' Luclin engine. Some fan faire stuff
was  saying they are excited about all the stuff they can do with it
for planes of power.

As someone playing luclin with all models enabled fine, on  a p2 400,
tnt 16 meg agp, was 384 meg ram now 576, I don't see all the problems
people are having. I just set texture quality to low and clipping way
down and am fine. By power I'll probably have a new MB proc and
graphics card ;) I'm holding out for the geforce 4 4200, which is
coming in at 199 or something.
