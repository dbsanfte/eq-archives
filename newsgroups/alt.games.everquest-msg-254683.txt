There was a fun fake news story on the PCGamer site:

God's Classic Game Doing Just Fine

Players of God's (developer of The Universe, Reality, Existence, Time)
Massively Multiplayer game Real Life just can't stop playing. Ever
since the highly anticipated game�s launch several billion years ago,
sales have shown that despite problems with the interface, lack of
direction, the monotony of the quests, and the highly addictive
gameplay, new subscribers join every second. Analysts announced that a
surge in recent players help Real Life top even EverQuest to become
largest MMORPG. God could not be reached for comment at press time. �
