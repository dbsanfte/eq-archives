Use the first mez you have, then tashan, then charm. This will make it last
longer

At your lvl the charms are shortlived as it is your will to command a weaker
foe etc.. charming becomes more effective in later lvls. Once you have it
charmed and fighting, make sure you keep the other critter mrooted so if
charm breaks you only have one on you.
