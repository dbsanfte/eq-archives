Short answer: No.

SOE/VI completely resist any attempt at localising there product which is
amazing cosidering the southern hemisphere market, ie: Korea. and European
market.

Every single patch that occurs normally wipes you out for 6 hours and at
least one or two days of fixes afterwards which all occur smack bang in the
middle of Asian play time. Centralised servers in the states mean even if
you have cable in Asia you are screwed connection wise, dial up forget it
completely.

It is better to look for another product that localises, not only do you
miss the downtimes but the....  *ahem* ....background noise.... tends to be
a lot more palatable as well.

DAOC is getting localised for Korea so at least the time zone is going to be
closer to us, and it will be an ideal way to learn a relatively simple
language. UO has a server right here in Sydney. Playing with 12ms ping from
cable is a dream.
