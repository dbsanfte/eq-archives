Given the info above? Mage - easy decision to me.

The nukes and TL's of a Wiz are handy for sure, but with a mage you get
decent nukes and a backup tank.

I would, however, try and convince the "or 2" part of the shaman side to
diversify. Adding a druid instead would give you the same secondary healer
while adding another set of usually stackable buffs, evac, additional dots,
and even some mild nukes. Other classes would off other things, but this
would seem closest to addressing the would be shammy's desires while still
offering the group something new.
