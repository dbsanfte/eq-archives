But that was when there were not to many weapons better then the SSoY. Now,
there are better weapons that are easier to obtain then the SSoY. Platinum
my drop at the same rate. The SSoY may drop at the same rate. But now better
weapons drop faster and more likely then the SSoY. Hence the worth of an
SSoY is 500pp on that persons server. Heck, you would be lucky to get
150-200pp on my server for an SSoY and that is after sitting in EbayCommons
for about 12 hours trying to exclusively sell it.

PS> Btw, I am also one of those old-timers that does remember when the SSoY
sold for 12-15k pp. That was why I camped for mine and did not buy it. But I
would not give you more then 100pp for it today regardless.
