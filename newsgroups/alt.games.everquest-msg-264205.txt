"Christmas sales" are highly overrated in estimating the release of a
game. Blizzard has had several record-breaking releases that were
released at various points in the year several months before or after
Christmas. If the game is good, it doesn't matter when they release
it.

Look at CoH: One of the fastest growing MMOGs (though the numbers have
probably rounded off), and it was released...in May.
