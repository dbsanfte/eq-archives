I just set my Cache file to a manual 1024 min to 1024 max file size...
This way it's not constantly trying to resize the file. - This has improved
performance some.  Also, setting some line "InternalCache" or
ForceInternalCache or something like that in the system.ini file is rumored
to help as well. Can someone post that line?
