I've heard from a reliable source of VSR spawning as quickly as 5 minutes 
after VS was killed.  Bind near KC, when you login and get ready to camp, 
go check to see if he's up.  Also when groups break up, or generally when 
you don't have anything else to do.  Often someone in KC will know when he 
was last killed and let you know when he should be up again.
