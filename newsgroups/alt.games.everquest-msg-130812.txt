That's hardly a fair way to treat the entire guild because *some* people 
are abusing his class.  And the guild leaders might not take direct 
threats too nicely.  It sounds suspiciously diva-ish, even though he 
does have a valid point.  I'd rather someone came to me and said "I'm 
having a problem with this, and I'd like your permission to refuse 
people after such and such a point."  If they have a problem with *that* 
I'd be perfectly happy to pull out the /guildremove option.

Also, disappearing without bothering to tell anyone most likely wouldn't 
leave you with a lot of friends left in the guild.  Sure, you're paying 
for your time, but it's a decent thing to do to let people who enjoy 
gaming with you *know* what's going on, rather than putting the whole 
guild through shit just to make a point.

Note that I've never played a druid (well okay, I've got a level 6 druid 
*g*), but still - IF I were the friend to a druid, and they did either 
of those, I'd be a little annoyed at their lack of trust that a guild 
would be willing to deal with the problem.  And come to think of it, one 
of our guild members (not a druid) *did* disband because he was having a 
problem with someone.  He wouldn't tell me who, but I pointed out to him 
that the guild leader was away for a week and would have absolutely no 
idea this was going on, and it'd be much better if he'd discuss it with 
her before deciding to leave.  I guess he took my advice, because he was 
back very soon after our guild leader returned, and I've not heard any 
more complaints.  Thing is, the GL was having the same problem with 
people requesting her to go away from what she was doing to help them in 
some way, so she would sympathize with that.  Maybe this person's GL 
will realize the problem too.
