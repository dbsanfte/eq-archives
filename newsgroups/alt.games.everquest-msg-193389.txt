It looked more to me like he was trying to establish the basis for
common understanding that underlies any well-reasoned discussion.
Of course, he apparently couldn't resist doing so in a way that
was likely to jerk your chain, but then he's not the first person
in this NG to fail to resist that temptation.  Seriously DT, try
taking a deliberately charitable attitude and responding in that
vein the next half-dozen times you read a reply that makes you
want to snap right back at it.  You might be surprised.  That way
it becomes a deliberate choice instead of a knee-jerk when you
(figuratively) get in someone's face.  People might take more of
your posts seriously instead of just thinking "there he goes again".
