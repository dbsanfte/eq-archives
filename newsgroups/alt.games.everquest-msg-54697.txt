You CAN get dragon haste without a raid.  All 30 to 35% dragon haste
items I'm aware of are droppable:  CoF, RBB, the CoF clone from CS
Fish, Cowl, etc... with just one exception:  Cloak of Piety from
Trakanon.

With the general trend towards retarded mudiflation, it won't be long
before you can buy a CoF level haste from someone for about 20 to 25k.

Barring that, you can shoot for RBG and/or Seb cloak in Sebilis.  It's
a VERY rare random load off some of the non-named frogs.  Just spend a
lot of time beating on things in Seb with a group and you'll not only
get a shot at getting a decent haste item but also get some loot which
can then later be used to buy a better haste item.
