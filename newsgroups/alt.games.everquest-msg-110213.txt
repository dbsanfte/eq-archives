Sorry, wheres this relevant?

How about you bind in the Nexus, with easy access to all Luclin zones,
whilst you can still port to ANY zone with a druid ring.

They already can.

What level are you?  This isn't meant as an eletist "well your low level wtf
do you know" comment, but in your other post you mentioned quadding in IC,
which makes me guess your in your 30's-40's.. so how the hell do you know
the healing capabilities of druids in the end game?

No you just want to be even more over powered, and think bitching and
bitching will help that

Warriors don't get mend.  And you do realise how small of a difference Regen
makes right?  Sure it helps a bit, but were talking 20-40 hitpoints a tick,
so you do the math how long that will take to regen 4k of hitppoints...

Well if your going to say you meant monk, when you said warrior and mend...
I'd love to know which slowing and snaring weapons you see monks using.
Tunares snare procing weapons aren't exactly within easy reach to 99% of the
game...
