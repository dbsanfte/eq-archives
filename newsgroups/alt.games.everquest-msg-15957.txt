All the advice already given is good for general advice, but for some
serious leveling from about 12 to 16/17, go to the alluring sirens in The
Ocean of Tears, you should be able to take the double spawn solo.  The
sirens are ALWAYS ( in my over 700 kills ) level 12, but they dont hit very
hard, however, do take a pack of bandages, they are a lot more efficient
than your healing spells when you can use them, and the sirens spawn on a 6
or so minute timer ( always the same time on all the sirens )

Directions: get on the boat in Freeport, wait past the first stop, then the
island with cyclops on it, then about 5-10 minutes of open water, and you'll
see some tall mountains sticking out of the water, jump off the boat and
swim to them ( when you are between them), When finished killing if you need
to go bank/buy/sell, just wait for the boat and swim in front of it ( make
sure to get in position before it gets between the islands) look straight up
and into the boat, it should scoop you up and carry you onward to
Butcherblock.

Note: this may not be possible without a magic weapon, I've always had one
so I'm not sure.
