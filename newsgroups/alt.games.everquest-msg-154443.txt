Lets say AC can range from 1 to 2000 max.
We'll keep all the current AC numbers, just use them
differently.

We don't ever want mobs to do zero damage to
anyone.

At the same time, we want ALL upgrades to AC
for any class whatsoever to have some effect.

1000 AC will be our target AC the system is
designed around.

There will be diminishing returns as you move
away from this target.

1000 AC will mean all damage you take is cut
in half.

1500 AC will mean damage you take is cut
to a quarter.

2000 AC will mean damage is cut to an eighth

Lets see, working the other direction.

500 AC will mean you take 3/4ths the damage,

0 AC will mean you take full damage.

All damage incoming is always rounded up.

Whats the equation I'm looking for to do this?

Does it make any sense, anyway?

I don't like it so far.  The idea is right but the effect
isn't, low end AC isn't viable for warriors, who are only
going to see marginal mitigation.  Now I see where
something having to do with the level of the mob
is going to have to be included.

Still, the basic kernal of the idea is there, AC always
makes some difference, but as your AC goes up
it makes less and less difference, so you never
get to where mobs are doing no damage at all.

Play with this idea some and lets see if we can build
a real proposal.
