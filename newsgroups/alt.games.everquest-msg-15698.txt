Yes you must be doing something very wrong, it was seemingly agreed that as
monk below 50th you should be able to tank as well as any warrior. Perhaps
all those that declared that as fact can put you right there.

Seriously, turn off attack and step back (don't run around like a headless
chicken)  the tank (assuming he is attacking the mob) should get it off you
then start attacking again. A Rogue and a Monk make a great partnership no
taunt skill required with the damage they dish out.

Hint, save as many skill points as you can for 17th level, don't waste any,
you want at least 20 imo for Feign Death, it's at this point monks come into
their own (I didn't do this, the monk was my first character and I made a
royal screw up of it, ended up deleting him at 20th) FD will save your life
more times than you'll be able to count by the time your 25th.
