Further, a static value for SOW is obviously wrong, as you can easily see for
yourself; get a level 9 shaman to cast SOW on you and take a jog around POK,
then get a much higher level SOW caster (shaman, druid, ranger, beastlord all
get the spell by 30) and run another lap, you'll see you've finished it
noticably faster.

Another question, with Walk on do you have a constant speed, or is your speed
still influenced by any speed enhancers you have on?  I believe the latter to
be correct, but never really measured to see.
