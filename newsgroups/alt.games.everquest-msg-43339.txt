Using only my own experience - DAoC is marginally better. The skill
specialization tree character system DAoC uses works very well for
casters - two casters of the same class can be completely different.

However, there is less overall variety in the spells than EQ. Atm fun
spells (as opposed to raw combat spells) are few and far between.

It's a tossup.

One thing - casters are a lot more fragile in DAoC than they are in EQ
- especially noticable in PvP. If a caster comes under attack from
someone their level they will NOT stand up to it for long, including
the possibility of being one-shotted if you're in a group against a
higher level monster. Almost nothing in EQ can one shot even the
casters, besides a few ubermobs, so this takes some getting used to.
Aggro control is king.

Dunno what else to say.. all casters can solo, some casters are pet
users, theres casters similar to all the EQ casters but in general
they are not as powerful comparatively as EQ casters are.
