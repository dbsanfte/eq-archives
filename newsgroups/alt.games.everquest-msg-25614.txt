They aren't, actually. It's a few people with poor manners who beg. Now, I see
nothing wrong with requesting a SOW, or buffs, from another player, but it's
very rude to do it in /say, and moreso to /shout or /ooc it. /tell should be
the only channel that such requests go in. I always, when asking for...a rez,
let's say (I have Jboots and I'm past the level I'd need buffs from someone who
wasn't in my party) I always ask something like this:

/tell Cleric Greetings, I was wondering if you could help me with something. I
died in <zone>, and I'd really appreciate a resurrection. If you have the time,
it would be very appreciated. I understand if you don't. I can donate some
plat, if you want.

That works 90%, the 10% usually being clerics who genuinely can't do it,
because they're getting ready for a raid or whatnot. I'm usually not taken up
on the offer for a donation (I give the cleric 20 to 50 platinum if I am,
depending on how far the cleric has to travel, etc. Also I did the same thing
for SOWers--not 20 platinum of course, but 5 or 10), but if I am I always do.
It's the principle, I think, of offering to donate. Also very important is
leaving the cleric with a good impression, IE thanking him or her heartily for
the service they provided you.

 ('Please SoW, please heal,
>please give me some money, please buff me ... and so on) ... It takes
>all of their/your fun!
You'll get used to it. On the bright side, there's much less of this once you
get into zones intended for above level 30 or so.

That's exactly why people beg. In Quake, begging will get you shot between the
eyes, d00d

 If you miss

If you don't like people begging, /ignore them or if they're begging from you,
go anonymous.
