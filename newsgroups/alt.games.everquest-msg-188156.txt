Gamma setting?

I dunno.. my colours are funky,  sometimes when I log another character (on
or off - EQW), one of the screens goes wayyy dark

I've seen a bug on the gamma bar too, its in the middle, but when i click it
(in the same spot along the slider), the slider doesn't move, but the
brightness jumps right back up

I recall something about a diff engine for gamma/colour, depending if its
windows or full screen...?
