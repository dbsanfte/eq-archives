Bah!  Not once (well, not once that i remember) have i grouped with,
been hunting in the same game as a person even using a fungi the
entire time i have played eq.  Usually fungi people are off soloing
somewhere else.  Sure there are probably some cases where it has
affected other's games, but the impact is insignificant compared to
the myriad of other annoyances out there. I just don't believe people
when they say it ruins their game, as my experience is that people who
play with fungis have no noticeable impact on me.  I, instead, suspect
envy as the motive for you complaint, and who wants to hear another "I
don't have x, it is too powerful, it needs to be nerf (so i can afford
one| because i can't use one)" arguement.
