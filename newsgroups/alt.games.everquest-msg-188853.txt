You will want to have SOL for the bazaar. This will provide you with a
source of income (selling silks, bone chips etc), as well as equipping your
character. POP wont give you any extra zones to hunt in (at your level), but
it gives you acess to POK portals, so you can travel large distances
quickly. Some of the spells sold in POK were nodrop, but I think they
changed that, so you should be able to get all your spells with a friends
help.
Id say get sol for sure, and pop if you can afford it. Theres lots of other
ways to get around, albeit a little slower.
