Might work well in Veksar, there's lots of undead around but it
wouldn't work in Sebilis for the Fungi camp. Even if you could charm
the emperor (he's a pretty rare spawn deep in the ass end of the
dungeon behind a locked door) your odds of actually getting him down
to the Fungi king without something going wrong are pretty negligible.
And if you do make it, then you have to deal with multiple lvl 56
mobs, all summon and some are clerics that gate and complete heal. A
high lvl necro could solo the fungi but I don't think they'd have a
chance pre-60.
