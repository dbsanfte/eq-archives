Comment: If you do filter don't forget you did it. I filtered all 3 when we
first had the option to do so just for the purpose of testing to see how
much it lessens the amount of data in your log file.  I went for probably 6
months or so without realizing I had filtered them until I suddenly noticed
East Commons was not having /auction like it used to.  Sadly I may have
missed some really good deals.
