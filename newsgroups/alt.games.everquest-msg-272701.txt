totally agree with you, I like so much of EQ2 but I am getting more 
irritated that so many of my quest cannot be done unless i go through all 
that grouping hassle. By the time many of the quest can be done solo nearly 
or all mobs will be grey.

I am doing AQ2 now how high a lvl would one have to do to be able to manage 
that solo? Anders (AQ1) being a tough end of quest mob was fine because 
there are always people around to help but quest after quest?

I have to say two things though: daily shutdowns are very annoying 
especially GMT and similar timezoners but how can people say the game is 
beta and unready? I have never played a MMORPG so full of content and most 
of it works fine.
