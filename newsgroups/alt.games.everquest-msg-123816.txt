ROFL!

I'm almost positive this story was either written by a guildie of mine
or the exact same thing happened to him.  I remember rolling on the
floor when I first heard about it.

Question though:  The guildie I'm thinking of has *always* called his
pet Dogdog.  In fact, we often (in /gu) will invite Dogdog over to
groups and assure him he can bring that Shaman he hangs around with as
well - if he must.  :-)   Is the "Dogdog" name usage real common to
Shaman?  If not, then I'm sure it was written by the guildie.  If so,
then I'll just wander away quietly.

Beurlom?  I know you lurk here from time to time...

More curious than anything, really.
