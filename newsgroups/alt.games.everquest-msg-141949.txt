Woot.  I've got some logs with that problem.  Until now I've just
editted them and removed the offending message.  Your update
will save me the trouble of tracking them down in the future.

Where in the hell do those come from, anyway?
Is someone actually going "/em saved", or does the game
generate spurious "saved" announcements for other players?
