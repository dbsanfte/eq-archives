Your chicken little analogy is losing water Ben. Sorry but I don't agree
with you on that point. Lokari's point about appealing to the lowest common
denominator is quite valid. In our society we tend to dumb things down to
the lowest common denominator, rather than make them learn the process as a
whole. In a broader sense as a society we remove the "Strive for Success"
ideology we should be taught, and replace it with -"well if it's too hard we
need to make it easier." Though many of the changes being implemented are
quite appealing to me I can still regard her points as quite valid. I don't
know your play history (how long you have been a member of the game) or any
other aspect of your ability which could validate your ideas/position - and
I am not knocking your ability as a player at all - you are probably more
experienced than I am. However I do know that my personal game experience
has been 2 years plus in the game and I have experienced most aspects of the
game from high to low levels. Perhaps people could place more credibility in
your statements if you backed it with some proof that you as a gamer have
the information to make your position valid. Lokari in my opinion has
consistently presented herself as a person with a firm logical grasp of the
game and its mechanics.To close- I feel that anything that lowers the
learning curve and the difficulty in this game is detrimental in that a) It
denies many of the feelings of accomplishment achieved by reaching these
goals the old fashioned way - by earning them,  and b) It once again denies
people the learning that is necessary to keep you and your compatriots alive
and healthy in the environs of Norrath. It's like the difference in "old
money" and "new money" - if you've made it yourself you can do it again, but
if its given to you, you place less value on the end result and often
squander the benefits you have been graciously given. I like the changes
personally for my own selfish reasons, but are they good for the game as a
whole - only time will tell.

Respectfully,

John Galt
