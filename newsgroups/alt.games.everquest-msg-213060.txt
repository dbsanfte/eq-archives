Why don't you, being that you were the first one to make claims about
their test systems. Oh, wait, standard tactic people like when arguing
against me. Divert attention from their own bullshit by telling me I
need to cite when I argue against it. Nevermind that they can't cite
either....

You're the one calling foul, burden of proof lies with the accuser.
I'm waiting....

I'll be right there to poke their soap-bubble whines about inadequate
testing, yes. There comes a point where someone's system is so far
from the "standard" that compatibility issues become their own fault
and not the responsibility of the programmers trying to meet with the
majority audience.
