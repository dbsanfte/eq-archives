Yup. I've played three female characters. Mhari was a human magician (recycled
because I didn't really like mages.) Tvara was an Erudite enchanter (recycled
because at 3rd level she fell of the boat in Erud's Crossing and got munched by a
shark. Decided to try a warrior after that.) And Rosewhite Blossom, Halfling druid
and my main character.

As to why, the answer is simple. I enjoy roleplaying. When I play a male character,
he almost always becomes me, no matter what kind of personality I want him to have.
With a female character, I have to spend more time thinking about what she will say
or how she will react. I am more "on the stage", as it were, which (for me) makes
them much easier to keep up.
