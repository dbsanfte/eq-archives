If a cleric isn't getting at least 50p PLUS 1/6 of the GROSS loot (not net)
PER HOUR then he's not getting his fair share.

How often does that happen?  And in multigroup raids the cleric must STILL
get 50p an hour, even if their group kills NOTHING.  And in multigroup raids
where one group doesn't HAVE a cleric, that's 100p PER HOUR.

How often does that happen?  I'm thinking that most likely the cleric is
being sodomized.
