Thanks for the info. I was basing that on a Hard LDoN we tried last
weekend where monk lull was basically worthless, ended up winning in
overtime when we switched to having the SK pull. Being that we don't
have raid lvl gear, it's hard for my normal group to consistantly deal
with multiple pulls of mobs that hit for 1000.
