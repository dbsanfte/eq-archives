I read through the previous Run3 thread and didn't exactly come away with a 
firm opinion on the subject, so I thought I'd hit it one more time.

As a bard, I feel that having Run3 would prove useful indoors and in 
situations where I don't want to use a twist slot for Selo's. Also, the 
fact that I would always be able to depend on it since it never runs out is 
a big factor. Yes, I could purchase the indoor Selo's from a LDoN merchant, 
but that's still slower than Run3 with all but the most uber drums 
equipped, nevermind the fact that I wouldn't want to spare a song slot just 
for that or have to stop to mem it everytime we move any distance.

I hit 51 the other night, and that that first AA, even applying 100% xp to 
AA, is coming really slowly. I understand that level 52 wouldn't 
necessarily come any faster, but it seems that I'm gonna be stuck at 51 for 
a long time to get Run3.

My questions are thus:
1. I don't solo a lot, but when I do, would Run3 support swarm/chant kiting 
more than adequately?
2. Are there many mobs in the game that can outrun Run3?
3. What have the experiences of other bards been like?
4. Run3 is the only AA I intend to get before switching right back to 100% 
normal xp most likely until I reach 65 (heck, maybe even 70 it appears), so 
I'd just like to know that it would really be useful get it. Are there any 
other AA's that are considered to be "must haves"?

Tia.
