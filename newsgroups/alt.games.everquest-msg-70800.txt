I get the same message every time I try to enter a server. When I got the
details from the error message, I got the following:

EQGAME caused an invalid page fault in
module EQGFX_DX8.DLL at 017f:10063828.

I'm running a 350mhz AMD K6-2 with the SIS530 chipset and 344meg of RAM. I
was able to log in the first night (although I dropped out several times,
which stopped when I turned off my firewall) but the graphics were screwed
up. The next evening (after the next patch), I started getting the same
error message. I wrote to Verant and got back the standard auto-reply,
followed by an honest-to-God real message to the effect that the new patch
OUGHT to fix it (it didn't). Wrote them again, got another standard
auto-reply and then nothing more.

Definitely maddening!
