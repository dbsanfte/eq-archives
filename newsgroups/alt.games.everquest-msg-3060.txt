99.5% of the time I agree with you.  Significant changes like the pack
weights, though, could be announced as a server message for a day ahead of
patch day.  *Then* if you get screwed by someone, it's because you were a
little careless and ignored the server message when you popped into Norrath.
If you'd have known about it a day or so ahead of time, could you have saved
the money and time on the Trumpy's?  I've never made one ... don't know how
labor and time intensive it is.
