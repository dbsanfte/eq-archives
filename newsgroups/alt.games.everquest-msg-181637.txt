Greetings all.  I recently purchased the EQ Trilogy and created a new 
account.  While I'm playing, there's no sound.  Music loads up and plays 
without a problem.  I've tried adjusting the sound in-game.  I've also 
checked all my drivers and they are the latest.  I've tried a couple of 
different servers and none of the characters have sound.  Has anyone else 
run into this?  I'm using the onboard sound on my nforce2 motherboard under 
WinXP-SP1.
