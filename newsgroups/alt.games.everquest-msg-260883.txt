I was eagerly awaiting the release of OoW so my 65 Enchanter could get
the Improved Dire Charm AA and go soloing in some neat places like Inner
Acrylia, Sol C, Droga, and Grieg's End.

But there was no IDC to be found.  What happened?  It was in the beta,
right?  Did testing show it was too powerful or something?

I realize SOE never said exactly which AAs would be in OoW, so I'm not
accusing them of anything.  I just felt like ranting.
