only bit of advice i can give is to start a charectr of anygivin race/class and
try it out if that charecter is not to your liking then try another then a
nother or you can pick up the stratagy guide or whatever, that you can find
anywhere the game is sold for like 20 bucks and read until it hurts then you
can make a decision on what type of charecter to play but its all about
instinct and how you wnat to play 





I see dumb people....
They are everywhere....
And they don't even know it....
Worst off most of them work with me!
