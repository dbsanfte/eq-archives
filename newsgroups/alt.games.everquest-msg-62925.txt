Tried mozilla and couldn't stand it.

I reboot my 98 and ME machines everyday just because.   My 2000 server is
rebooted about once a week.  It cleans out some log files I run on my
database and application server software.  I think my mail server might also
have a memory leak but it's no big deal.  10 minutes downtime once a week is
deal withable.

Mine either unless the get rid of the snoopware registration.

I have to spend too much time keeping up with databases and middleware  to
worry about my desktop OS.  The only time I worry about os issues is if I'm
upgrading my dev boxes and that's strictly for compatibility.  People who
know a lot more about OSs than me upgrade production servers at client
sites.  And on those machines it's usually Unix anyway.
