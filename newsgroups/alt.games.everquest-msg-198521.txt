You know, I really wonder if people like this have any clue as to how
businesses work...

Scene: The boardroom of Sony.

CEO:Gentlemen, we're losing money. What should we do?

Guy in Suit #1: We should restructure our electronics division to
better leverage our synergies.

Guy in Suit #2:We need to be more proactive. We need to move the
cheese outside the box.

Guy in Suit #3:We have to manage operating expenses to create
positive-growth tendencies.

Guy in Suit #4:Let's nerf mages!

Here's a clue -- the people making the money decisions at Sony are
probably only barely aware they even HAVE a game called 'Everquest',
and they certainly don't know how it works or have anything to do with
design/balance decisions. No one at Sony Corporate is sending out
memos reading "Nerf mages". Trust me on this.
