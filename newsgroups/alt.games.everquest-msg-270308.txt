EQ2 would probably be a good one to pass some time to allow some of the 
others to maybe make it to beta.

It has a very good quest system, with boatloads of quests.

It is soloable, but it does slow down considerably in the high teens.

Tactical options for soloing are pretty limited, more available for 
groups, if you can get a good group going.

Many like the tradeskill system, my biggest gripe is the extreme 
dependency on other tradeskillers to get the basic components for mid 
level and higher combines.

Personally, I still prefer EQ1, warts and all to EQ2, but am playing both 
as I have friends playing both.
