If you are willing to step outside your porting box,
consider cleric/ranger.

Once you hit level 9 you'll have snare and fear, and
rangers are quite considerable damage producers
when they don't have to worry about tanking.   While
fear kiting the cleric will be able to melee too, or
even nuke credibly.

Both of you will have root available to park adds,
and when you level up into the thirties, the cleric
will get atone, which allows you to root park stuff
and then forget about it.

The cleric can also make the ranger more credible
in the tanking role with HP and AC buffs, and won't
start whining about how inefficient healing a ranger is
till the mid 40's, by which point you should be looking
at more of a full group to do anything serious, and
just pick up a warrior as part of the team.

With a cleric you'll have no trouble getting groups
when you want them up thru 60, even when you
tell them its a package deal, you and a ranger.  Rangers
aren't, unfortunately, all that looked for at higher levels,
but its not because they are crap by any means, just
not as optimal as some of the other classes.

PS I'm sure a high elf cleric and wood elf ranger
will share a common language and alignment choice.
On the other hand, a half elf ranger and dwarf cleric
will have more languages to teach each other, since
you have voice phone contact and don't -need-
language to communicate, the question being this
alignment issue.  Haven't seen anything posted on
that subject yet, no idea how it works.

I do think it would be interesting for you to group
with people where only one of you speaks their
language, so you can translate for each other.  Not
sure it would be prudent, but interesting.
