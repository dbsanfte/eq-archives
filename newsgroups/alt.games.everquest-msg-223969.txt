I could see where this one was going just from my answers.

You are a Necromancer

You are dark and mysterious 
Even those that know you sometimes question how well they really know 
you. 
You are misunderstood. 
Most people think you are odd, and few can see past that eerie presence 
of yours. 
Deep inside, you are sensitive, smart, and have a gentle heart. 
Got Angst?
