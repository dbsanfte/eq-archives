And I wouldn't give a second thought to replying either but I am, so
sue me. It is just a game, but people are making money on it, or
PL'ing players, and others are just upsetting those of us that want to
play I am not an expert on Eq, and hope I never am, it is just a
pastime. This whole thing with the dungeons is a joke above. I've been
to SolA, SolB, ToFS, Kaesora, and many more dungeons on Kunark that
would make most peoples head spin (yes I am in a guild).

Learn to read bud, I did not say I was assisting the 2nd tank. I said
I was assisting the "puller" -- if I did assist the 2nd tank it was
because HE/SHE was on the wrong darn target to start with (which is
why the enchanter got upset). I announce what I am attacking, my point
was that the enchanter was not directing traffic at all, something I
think that kinda needs to be done a little if people (NEWB's) are
attacking and not /assist. I think most of these people I was partied
with this day were all PL'ed, and had no clue what was going on, but
the chanter needed someone to blame it on. I have the pet hot keyed
for /pet pull back and I know to wait to see which the puller is
attacking first, I usually even ask if time permits, but most good
enchanters can decipher that and most good assisters can as well.

Not at all, and I dont know what gave you that impression. I just was
ranting that I did not like this nOOb enchanter that had never seen
before. I have been in DL since level 40 and this was the first time
ever having a problem. Hundreds of people I group with can vouch for
me.

I totally agree! I love enchanters but not IDIOT ones that dont know
what they are doing, or like to always blame the player with the pet.
Not a tude at all about chanters, but about stupid ones, that falsely
accuse me of something. Like I've said I've been in hundreds of groups
in DL, and other places, and think I have a good enough reputation
that groups welcome me, including enchanters.

I believe in following the enchanter, and I do follow the /assist then
/g I am on %t, then I sick pet on it too. If I ever pick the wrong
target (hey it happens - no one is perfect) I am usually hit hard and
know right away /pet pull back, and then I reassist the tank as the
chanter mezzes the creature. I'm not perfect but like to think that as
long as the puller has the correct target I am on it too.

In the instance I described above the puller was on one, and the
second tank was on another as I stood there and asked "which one am I
supposed to attack". My pet and I were totally standing there while
both tanks were wacking away so I assisted one of them and got blamed
for Aggro by the Enchanter. I think if I ever played an enchanter I
would pull my hair out, I totally repect what they do, but they have
to make sure the whole group understands /assist and this does not
happen.
