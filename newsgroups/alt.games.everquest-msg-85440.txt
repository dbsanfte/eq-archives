According to the castersrealm calculator, each point of wisdom above 200 is
worth 5.8 mana, regardless of level.  Each point up to 200 is worth 1 mana
per 5 levels, as you stated.  Specifically though, for up to 200, your mana
is:

level*2+(level/5)*(Wis or Int)

After 200 wis, it is:

(Wis-200)*5.8

So, that means that regardless of level, if your wisdom is 200, then you
should choose between a wisdom vs mana item based on 1 wisdom compared to
5.8 mana (rounding to the nearest whole number).

So, if you have to choose between say 3 Wisdom, and 20 mana, take the mana.
(3*5.8=17.4 which is 17 mana)  (If you care about tradeskill advancement,
then keep the wisdom handy too.)  If it's 4 Wisdom vs 20 mana, take the
Wisdom.  (4*5.8=23.2 which is 23 mana.)
