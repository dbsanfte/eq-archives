You miss the point I'm trying to make. Verant has already stated that
they will adjust mob speeds to compensate. 

Lower prices of horses = more horses in Norrath
More horses = more mobs speeded up to compensate/balance

There are some mobs currently that have either latent SoW, or the
ability to cast it. Lots of horses means lots more mobs coded to run at,
or above, SoW speed. 

In a nutshell:

1: Kiting will be made impossible without a horse
2: Escaping from a mob will become much more difficult
3: CR will become much more difficult without a horse, especially if
'magic whistles' aren't soulbound (which they probably won't be)
4: Shaman and druids (and high rangers) have a core class spell
superseded  by a purchasable infinite charge item (jboot speed is less
than SoW, fast horses are faster than SoW)
