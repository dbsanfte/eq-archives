   I have to admit, the landmines are the only thing that about this that I
really enjoyed.  I had fun the one time I saw my disembodied penguin head hit
four of the suckers.   But yes, the amount of blood is way over the top.  And
why would the stupid penguin even jump at all when it saw those jagged razors it
would have to clear?  In the original version, at least it seemed to be having
fun flying through the air (Wheeeeeee!).
