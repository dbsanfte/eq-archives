Not to mention that with the XP changes, it's better to two-box than it is
to solo ... even if the second box is just running an XP sponge.

My normal group is a shammy/pally/ranger (I run the ranger).  By adding my
necro from account #2, our XP increases enough to make it noticible ... even
all I do with the necro is throw one dot and send in Jabober.
