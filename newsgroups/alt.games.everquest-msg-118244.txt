First, I must apologize to all for my contribution to the ever-growing
tide of misinformation out there. According to Monkly-Business.com it
*does* depend on the status of your other special ability buttons for
success. I mistakenly based my opinion on gut instinct after a night
of beer and pizza - bad idea. :(

It is *not*, however, tied to the kick skill at all - only the ID
skill itself.
