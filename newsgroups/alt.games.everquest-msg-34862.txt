Just my op, but you may want to consider something really different. Things
like a necro/magician team because of the dual pets, bandages, fear, damage
shields, burn, life tap, ... should be viable for at least 30 levels.

Same op, I would do a shaman in there if for no other reason then the SoW's.
Since you have two accounts, plausible you could login with the druid on one
account and SoW the character on the other account, then do the same with a
shammy on the other account. Two different accounts that can cross SoW each
other seem like a good idea.
