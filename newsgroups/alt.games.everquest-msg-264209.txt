If it were not a mmorpg that required a monthly fee, I'd agree with you
100%. However, my feeling is that the subscription fee might change
the dynamics a bit.

And I'm only referring to kids (which make up a big part of Blizzard's
demographics). If they ask for EQ2 or WoW for Xmas - they are
also going to ask their parents to pay for the subscription for some
amount of time (6 months? A year?).  Those kids are not going to
switch over to the other game a month later.

You have to remember - $200 (the cost of the game + a year's
subscription)  is *a lot* of money for an 11 year old.=)
