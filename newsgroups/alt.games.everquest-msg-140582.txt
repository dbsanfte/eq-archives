Umm - you just described a process called globalisation which is just
capitalisation with a passport. It is rather ironic that an American, which
are generally regarded  the biggest proponents and benefactors of both would
be so critical of a negative side effects they themselves experience.

You can't have your cake and eat it.

BTW, those Indians in question are proffessional CSR people who take their
jobs extremely seriously. They all have University Degrees and generally
speak very good english (albiet accented) as it is considered a high profile
job in India They aren't some shitkicker starting on the lowest rung and
praying for the day he can get away from direct contact with the customers.

Of course, being CSR only, they will only ever be as good as the support
documentation they have, but you get that in most large companies anyway
regardless of where in the world they are. Once your CSR are no longer Techs
<anywhere>, you will always get dumb "change your underwear to fix your
email" scenarios.

Somewhat related, next time you throw on your shirt, jeans, underwear and
shoes etc, remember are also generally  made in overseas countries, only
under normally appalling sweatshop conditions. The benefactors are the large
US companies that distribute and retail the products.

And before you say "Hey - this shit says <made in the USA> asshole", take a
look on your atlas for a little US territory called Saipan where most the
<made in USA> apparell is made, albiet in 3rd world sweatshop conditions.

There are positive and negative sides to globalisation, but I think
Americans more than anyone else have the least right to complain about the
negative side effects.
