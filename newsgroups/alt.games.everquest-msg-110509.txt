Nothing whatsoever.  Just sharing my perspective. :)

Many will commit evil in the pursuit of perfection or harmony, but neither 
of those is, in itself, evil.  Although absolute perfect harmony would 
probably bore me to tears pretty quickly, so that would be evil. :)

I do think she was probably gleeful, but there's nothing wrong with that, 
really, is there? :) And I thought demolishing his examples was probably, 
in this case, at that stage of the argument, the best way to attempt to 
show that his point cannot be established through the use of examples.  
The existence of so many counter-examples also makes a decent case for his 
point not being valid...

}What I

True enough.  Now, that last part is too long. May I suggest the terms 
Neo-good and Neo-evil to refer to the absolute neo-platonic ideal of good 
and evil, that all goods and evils are a reflection of?

}Damn, still in serious mode...
}Please cite for me the evidence that supports your disagreement.

The 'widely diverse' bit there.  I maintain that there is no single idea 
that would appear in everyone's idea of good, or everyone's idea of evil. 
If that much is true, and we accept that everyone's viewpoint is valid, 
then if there -is- an absolute universal concept of good or evil, it must 
consist of the null set.  And is hence, well, not very interesting or 
useful, really.

}Well, if it is indeed "a point worth discussing", and I agree that it
}is, then I don't see how you could avoid getting "some people pretty

Well, if someone gets "pretty worked up", they could have an aneurysm, 
or just be made a little unhappy or frustrated.  In a broader sense, that 
could be 'harm'.

I certainly am not advocating censorship. :)
