WoW is so far ahead of every other MMO out there (Well, excpet for Lineage 
and Lineage II I think) that it really does you no good to try to compare 
the numbers. None of the games currently out have a chance at catching WoW, 
and WoW is unlikely to ever dro to EQ numbers unless they really screw it 
up somehow.

If you want to compare numbers, you have to look at games that are close to 
EQ in size.
