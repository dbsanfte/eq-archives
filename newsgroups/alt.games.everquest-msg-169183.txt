Like really like the terming of this "mean to be". As a Bard, there is very
little in the way of pure melee mobs that I can't kill assuming open terrain
and perfect execution on my part. Depending on how high they are, resists
will be a problem, but I usually have at least 1-2 chants and as many as 4
that I can land some reasonable percentage of the time.

So, this begs the question: Why do I not just hunt reds - the xp much be
very nice. Well, in terms of efficiency, it is not good xp at all. As I
said, I have to execute to perfection, pray that there are no adds, etc.,
etc., etc.. In addition, even if all those things happen, the number of HP
and the regen rates normally mean that it can take a very, very long time to
kill the mob. I might get an increadible 2-3% xp at 51, but if it took me a
half hour or more to do it, then I'm not sure I came out ahead - especially
when the risk is taken into account.
