	Logged on tonight, got the new patch files, game hung - black
screen - after login.  Had to hit the reset to get out.  On reboot, got
windows protection error.  A pass through step-by-step showed the problem
to be in the vgart.vxd series of drivers.  Out to safe mode, reload via
4-in-1 and nvidia 54.61 drivers.  Back to normal modulo messed up icons
from safe mode.

	Now, the driver issue *could* have been the result of the hard reset.
But the black screen on game startup is a symptom of video driver problems,
and it seems like an awful coincidence.  I'm curious to know if other people
are experiencing video or agp driver related problems after todays patch.

	FWIW the system is a homebuilt Athlon 2000, kt-266 chipset, ti4600
video.
