Verant would like the people that run my apartment building.  They snuck in
a rent increase by doing this: one year, they offered a deal that if you
renewed your lease for one year, there would be no rent increase.  Your
monthly payment would go up, just like it did for people who did not have a
lease, but they'd give you a discount on the first month equal to the
difference for the rest of the year, so your yearly total was the same as
the previous year.

Then, next year, they offered one year lease renewals with no change in the
monthly rate.  Note that this really is a rent increase, because there was
no discount this time...but since the monthly payment was the same as people
had been paying for the previous 11 months, most people didn't catch the
rent increase.

There's no Harmony upgrade.  Rather, there was a major Harmony nerf, and
now there's a spell that is still a nerfed Harmony, but not as big a nerf.
