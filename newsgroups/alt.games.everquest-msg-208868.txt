    I didn't know you played on Test, DT. 

    This wouldn't serve the same purpose on FV, but if it does make it
liveside then it could solve another problem.  The shared plat slot
could become a "guild's money" slot.  Very nice, since it is harder to
have dedicated guild mules.  I look forward to this addition.
