I don't know a lot of this, but what I do know...

You can force feed yourself food, but you do not get the full benefit from
it.  Meaning, if normal eating of iron rations will keep you fed for a half
hour real time, each (pure example, since I have no clue on how long
different food/drinks last) then force feeding 2 will keep you fed for 45
minutes.
