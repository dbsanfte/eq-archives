Hi All


As someone who has taken nearly 2 years to get 3100pp in the bank. While 
most of my stuff is quested. I was interested to find this on the SOE 
site. Here it is in full:

Cheaters and the recent up swell of concern (12-8-03)

Over the last few days there has been a growing community concern about 
possible cheating, exploiting and platinum duplication.  Rumors and 
speculation have begun to run rampant, and I've received a lot of 
concerned email on the topic.

First of all, I want to thank you for your concern.  The fact that you 
worry about this stuff as much as we do makes me feel good about the 
community that I work for.  I want to especially thank those that have 
sent in detailed information about what they thought might be dupe or 
exploit situations.  That information has been very helpful.

With your help, we have been able to discover and eliminate some unusual 
ways of cheating. Obviously I can't go into detail about exactly how 
this cheating was done.  I can tell you that several of our programmers 
and designers took lengthy breaks from working on their current tasks to 
define, investigate and smash those exploits.  Most of these methods for 
cheating have been removed.  The few that remain will be fixed shortly. 
We will be watching, and anyone using them will be banned.

At the same time, our Customer Service folks have been diligently 
tracking down the cheaters.  We have banned accounts and deleted 
characters in the hundreds.  It's never a good thing to be forced to 
remove so many accounts, and we're not happy that such cheating was 
possible.  We are pleased, however, to let you know that we are 
confident that we have located the majority of those that exploited the 
game and have removed their characters or accounts.

Obviously we won't be able to prevent all of the possible ways to cheat. 
The folks that insist on trying to cheat have proven to be persistent 
and clever (and here is where I wonder why they don't apply that energy 
and skill to something beneficial...).  We need your help to locate 
these issues.  The multitude of eyes and ears of our players is always 
the best source of information for us.  If you ever suspect that you 
have discovered something that seems like an exploit, please send that 
information to us through the Developer's Corner AND through /bug. 
Please don't assume we have heard the information already.  We'd rather 
have ten reports about something like this than none.

I'd also like to address a rumor about the nature of some of the 
cheating that people have been talking about.  There has been 
speculation in the community that in order to pull off some of the 
rumored exploits someone had to be working on the "inside".

We take such possibilities very seriously.  And we have investigated 
this very thoroughly.  We keep track of all special EverQuest commands 
issued.  We have looked into the possibility that someone working here 
had a hand in helping others cheat, and we have discovered no evidence 
that indicates that to be the case.  Also, the nature of the cheat did 
not require such inside help.  I can't describe the cheat method in any 
detail, but there was an experience cheat that allowed extremely fast 
leveling. This required some rather sophisticated cheating, but was 
being done without inside help. Obviously we have removed that exploit 
and banned any accounts that used it.

Thank you for playing EverQuest.  And thank you for you help making the 
game fun.

Have a great holiday season.


Alan
