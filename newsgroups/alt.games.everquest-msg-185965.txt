I can confirm on my new twink that falling off the Highpass ramp in EK 
(and I don't mean all the way up either... you can clearly see the 
bottom) resulted in a 20K splat since that change.

Of course, for a stupid level 18ish, it's not like 10K or even 2K 
wouldn't have done me in, but the new default "You fucked up and fell a 
long ways, dipshit" is now 20K from the spots I've gone turf diving.
