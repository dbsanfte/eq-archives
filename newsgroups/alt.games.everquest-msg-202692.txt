We will also see who the real pullers are too, as there are a S-Load of
melee players out there accustomed to have a large mana pool of heals
available to them. It's going to be a shock to them as well, trust me. My
KEI addicted cleric has had many instances where hes gone oom because
pullers pulled what seemed like the whole zone, and then gone out and pulled
it again while the rest of the group was finishing off the first pull. Ok,
maybe a little exaggerated, but I think many of you know what I'm saying!
