	It is not necessarily part, in the logical sense, but it is the way the
art is taught in Norrath.

	It would be logically possible for a school of agnostic Necromancers to
exist in Norrath, but at this time no such school exists, and being that this
is a CRPG, the system isn't flexible enough for you to start one.

	FWIW, my own Necroleezard RPs lip service to Cazic-Thule at best.  His
/inspect bio says "Look, I hatched, some guy in a robe said 'the mana is
strong in this one', and they stuck me in a job where all I do is talk to dead
people."
