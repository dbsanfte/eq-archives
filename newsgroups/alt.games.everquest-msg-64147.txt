  I'm having the same problem.  I have tried downloading and extracting the
zip file on everquestlive.com, also.  It could just be that Verant's servers
are heavily congested thanks to the backlog of people trying to download the
patch all at the same time... Verant hasn't posted a status message
regarding the problem as of yet so I don't think anybody is precisely sure
what is going on.

  I'd periodically check everquestlive.com to see if they come up with
anything.
