Its half again your level, or 5 levels, whichever is greater.

1 with 6
2 with 7
3 with 8

and so forth, so that 9 you were with was limited to a 14,  you were
barely out of his range.

At 15, you can group with up to a 22, while if you are the highest
level in the group someone as low as 10 can group with you and
still get exp.

Level 40 is the big turnkey, at that point you can group all the way
up to 60, while grouping all the way down to 27, from this point
up there will always be fewer levels you can group with and all
get exp, each time you level up.
