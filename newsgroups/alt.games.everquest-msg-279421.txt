If you dont mind a potentially long camp, you can kill these
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=5422
...for this:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=4795
...however the easiest and most rewarding path for you would be to
start doing DoN's or GoD groups.  Both can provide vast improvements in
your gear if you will put the time in, and you don't have to join a
guild or be "uber" to kill those mobs.

A typical DoN will give you around 30 crystals.  Around 10 missions and
you can buy just about any of the nicest equipment upgrades (more
expensive stuff is mostly augments).  Mobs in WoS, RCOD, and even
Noble's Causeway drop a few upgrades you can use.  And with time, you
will get the faction and drops you need for the tier one armor, also
very nice stuff compared to what you have.  (around 100 HP or so on
each piece of gear, focus effects, etc..)

A monk expert would know best but I think your best option for DPS
would be to find a good 2hb, not 1hb or martial?

This drops in WoS:

...and would be a massive DPS upgrade.

Even better stuff is for sale at DoN merchants.  This is one of the
better 2hb for sale there, though it is level restricted:
