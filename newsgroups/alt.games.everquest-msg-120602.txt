No, wizards aren't useless at all.  Those who have no freaking clue about
aggro control, however, ARE...unless they don't mind dying 'cause there's no
way in hell I'd allow any cleric to heal one during a battle where they
overnuked for the 3rd time in 15 minutes.  Same thing for necros who overDOT
or druids who over nuke/dot or monks who won't FD, rangers who won't jolt or
rogues who won't evade (those are off the top of my head, I'm sure I can
come up with examples of "uselessness" for all classes).
