Charm is a huge taunt.  Charm also performs a mem-blur.  When charm breaks 
the bard is generally the only one on the hate-list.  Unless other 
characters immediately attack the mob, it will bee-line straight for the 
bard.  One of the reasons I still keep charm memmed in exp-grind 
situations is the ability to get the mob off the cleric now, and keep them 
off.  If I mez, and mez breaks, the mob still has a hate list, and it's 
possible that the cleric is still way up on the list.  If I charm, when 
charm breaks the mob only knows that he hates me.  
If you know how to charm, and have hotkeys which tell your group what your 
doing, charm is a great tool for exp-grind groups.  The 18-second 
duration is actually about the perfect amount of time for a melee-heavy 
group to kill the target mob, and you don't have to worry about AE procs 
or spells or poorly-trained pets waking the mezzed mob.
