I recently watched the first three movies for the first time in 10 years. 
Good movies.  Not all as good as the most recent installments, but they
still hold up well.

Opinions...  aren't they wonderful?  I liked the first three movies in
*spite* of what I considered to be truly horrible casting and/or acting (re:
Hammill).  There's a reason Harrison Ford is still a famous actor and he's
just the guy that played Luke.  =)

I thought they did a fantastic job on the recent movies, particularly in
casting and/or acting (McGregor makes a great Obi, especially when you
compare his mannerisms to the original movie).  I admit I'm not a huge fan
of Jar Jar, but the people screaming that he ruined Star Wars need to go
watch the first trilogy again.  I wasn't a huge fan of some of the (to me)
too outlandish alien puppets from the first three either.
