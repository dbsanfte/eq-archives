Just commenting directly on these, because it keeps coming up.
You mention they've said that paladins would have a spell to summon
the steed, then wonder why they'd have a spell if they've bought a
horse and have a whistle.   Easy:  they won't have to buy the horse.

Horses are an innate characteristic of the knight classes (paladins
and SKs), and they will be the only classes that don't have to buy
one.   For that distinction, they'll have to spend the mana getting one
each day, or every time they zone out of a city or dungeon where a
horse can't go.  They'll get the various types of horses as they level,
IMO, with the ability in their 50s to channel XP into the ability to get
a horse faster than anyone else's.

IMO, if you look at it from a "day one" viewpoint, pallys and SKs should
have always had horses.   Other people, if they wish, could buy one (like
t-boots)
