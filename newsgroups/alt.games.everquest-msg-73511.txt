Took five posts to get from "*shrug* ripped off when you can sell it for the
same price you bought it (or more)?" to this.  So is "ripped off" (not my
words) less bad if someone has enough money that it doesn't hurt?

I've seen fungi offered for 15k "cash only" in the past week (as well as RBG
for 20k "cash only" and CoF for 35k "cash only").  Some deals to be had if
you've got free cash from those people trying to get the top horse.  :)
