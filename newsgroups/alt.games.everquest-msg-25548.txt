I'm not saying you are wrong, but;

I have offended just about everyone here at one time or another, and my
e-mail address is easily accessible. I have never been sent any e-mails that
have been abusive or contained viruses from anyone in this group. As far as
I know, they keep it all in the newsgroup, or for some particular 'offences'
they might contact your ISP.

I really don't think you can guarantee it was someone from here.
