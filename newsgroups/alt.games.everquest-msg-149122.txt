2700 HP for 1000 mana.  Good casting time (5 seconds, no recast delay), so
good for when you need a lot of damage fast, and you don't have manaburn,
perhaps.  However, speculation is that it will drop off Solusek Ro himself,
so probably won't be very obtainable.

The upgrade to Manaskin looks nice.  Basically the same, except larger
damage absorber.

Overall, though, for Wizards, it looks more like "Planes of Slight Upgrade"
rather than "Planes of Power". :-)

Probably the most interesting spell I saw on the list was that Cleric AE
res.  That should really help cut down recovery time on raids.
