Range is usually pretty underused. Shammies have a few spears they can put
in the range slot as well as prim / sec so you might want to look into
those. No eggs in the game that can be thrown though (might be fun :)

Weapon skill increases are based on dexterity. Get that up and you're
golden. Also note that if you have a faster weapon you get more chances to
get skill increases.

So? Root it again, nuke it to death, redot it, you got spells >use them<.

Haven't looked into shaman sites lately, but you can find lots of general
shaman info and don't forget that most for ogres, trolls and barbiesz is
aplicable to you as well (being large race and all).

There are some decent quests, but not that many. I've noticed that it's
generally best to get a few levels first, then do the quest for fun's sake.

The problem VI sees with tradeskills is that they don't want everyone to be
able to get easy cash. If you want to simply do tradeskills you can try
tailoring or baking, both skills can/must use piles of stuff that comes from
mobs.
Especially tailoring is good at low levels, making yourself a suit of raw
silk or patchwork armor for the first time is simply great.
