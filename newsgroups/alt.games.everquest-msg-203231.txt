It gets even better at level 58 with the gimp CH.  Canni down to 10 to 
20%, heal, rinse repeat.  At level 61 it was taking me between 2 and 3 
cycles to get to 95% mana and health.  As I recall, gives an effective 
mana regen of 46ish mana per tick, almost four times KEI.  Mind you, I 
love having KEI on top of that.
