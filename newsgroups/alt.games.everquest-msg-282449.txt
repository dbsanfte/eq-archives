Ah my apologies.

I can imagine someone holding 3 screenshot printouts in front of
random_shoppper_#3 and saying 'which of these 3 would you play?' and them
not pointing at the 'ugly' EQ.

Anyway the new UI was released in conjunction with the freebie 1-10 server
and client, to try and get new people into the game.

I don't think they tried to make it look like Game X I think they just used
the same design principals the makers of current games used.  Right or
wrong I'm not commenting.
