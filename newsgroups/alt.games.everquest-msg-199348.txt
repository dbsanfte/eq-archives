I don't know, how did you?  Perhaps you didn't read the original post.  If
you did then you must be related to Graeme.  I made it pretty clear my
Shammy was in his high 40's before I got my first KEI.  So I guess I made it
a little past 14 too, with a Shammy, Necro, Claric and Mage before KEI even
existed!  Thats not to say I enjoyed all the useless time spend sitting
med'n mana.  Oh yea sure KEI is just plain sick on lower levels....  get a
clue!  I'll opt for KEI and the mana to cast a few more nukes or buffs OR to
cast gate and you can do a corpse run across several zones.  Whats sick is
either your arogent attitude or your ignorance.  You prefer not to have KEI
then fine.. knock yourself out.  If I perfer to have it I'll have it plain
and simple!

Ah your just plain full of shit.  At the bottom of this post it seems to
indicate you have an Enchanter or some other equally near HP-less caster and
Shaman at PoP levels.  Sorry but 30's, 25's and 23's can't play in the
Plains so your saying you and a Shaman did PoN together.  What, an Enchanter
and a Shaman!!!!  LOL  Like I believe that.  Maybe a couple mobs until your
charm broke and your were slaughtered before the Shaman could heal you and
BTW freddie, Shammys don't get Chloroblast until 56 so a 51 Shammy dosn't
have a fast patch heal!  I'd bet that halfling warrior is your main.

10 seconds and if you were ever in PoP I'd think that would be something
you'd know!  And its called a patch heal not "fast lower hp heal" (what
other kinds of heal are there but for HP heals??? gezzz...) another thing
I'd think you'd know if you had ever played in the Plains.

Who said "helpless"?  I didn't see that word in any previous post.  Now who
wouldn't want to be able to as you so elequenty put it "take on more mobs"?
And no, not necessarlly faster but certainly more mobs in less time!
