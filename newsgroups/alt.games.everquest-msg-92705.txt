Um yeah-I think I just thought they were gone.  I don't really pay attention
to how much rations I have until I start getting messages.  I thought I had
14 when I left the city and only had 3 when it happended, but maybe more
time had passed than I thought, or maybe it was just 4 not 14 or maybe they
slipped through the space time continuim and will show up on the next
episode of Star Trek.

I suppose the most logical answer is that I made a mistake and the message
was part of this erroneous message bug.

It is entertaining tho.  Just imagine if I did eat more and exploded.  Cool
graphics I bet.  Wonder if you could loot your body if it's in pieces???
