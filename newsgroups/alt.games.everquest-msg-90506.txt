I did the Millers in Qeynos Hills.  30 didn't even seem like a hell level.
However, back then no matter how many times you killed them your Qeynos
guard faction could only get as low as dubious, but I believe that was
changed, so if you want to save your faction with Qeynos you might not want
to kill them, though Qeynos is a pretty worthless city for druids and
killing them does not hurt your faction with any druid groups.
