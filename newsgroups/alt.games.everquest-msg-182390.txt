Assuming that doing any changes didn't take people away from things that 
need to get done - like fixing bugs - I'd like a limited form of C in more 
zones than it exists in now ( Hollowshade for example ) OR a form of B.

I'd also prefer more randomized loot tables so items don't drop only from 
specific mobs unless there is a story-line justifying it.

What I would really like is for more mobs to roam instead of just sitting 
at a camp.  Roamers really help make dungeons fun.
