Frustrated with camping Woopal, I took a shortcut; I bought a
Essence of Halfling in the bazaar.  Went to WC and found Slyfoot
hanging in the area near Kith (seen him on and off for ages on
other characters, so I knew where to look).  Downed my potion,
which changed faction, went and talked to him and got his letter.

Ran that back to Neriak Commons and gave the note to Draxiz, then
went off to the waterfall... where I had some trouble.  The walk
thru I read said he was behind the waterfall near the POD, but I
couldnt' swim thru the walls, clicking on them did nothing...
took me a while to figure out I needed to swim up and over the
top of the falls.

Very near the falls, I spotted the halfling spy.  Slowed him with
Walking Sleep, managed to stick a DOT to him too, then tanked him
down.  It was a fairly close fight, I was at about 20% when he
ran.  Had to chase him thru some skinny passageways, I was afraid
I was going to get stuck and miss killing him, or he'd die from
Tainted Breath and I'd be unable to loot!  Turns out to have been
groundless, but it was a difficult winding chase.  Snare would
have been nice!

Looted his head, went to Third Gate, only to find its impossible
for a troll to get up to Ithvol!  The stairway to the upper
section of the cleric guild has a spot I couldn't fit past,
ducked or unducked or using sit/jump or any other plan I could
come up with.  Finally I went back to Bazaar and bought a 10
charge Ant Potion.  This worked fine.  Gave Ithvol the head and
my Initiate Symbol and got Disciple Symbol.

Then I proceded to try getting the next quest out of him, but he
had a series of mocking things to say about how low level I was.
I'd heard I had to get to 16, seems thats the case.

The proc off the Disciple Symbol is pretty lame, Siphon
Strength.  I used it extensively getting from 14 to 16, as no
mana cost pulling device.  If I thought 10 str lower on the mob
made any difference, or that 10 more str on me made any
difference, I'd be more excited.  No mana cost, no spell slot
taken up pulling device is always nice though.

I might get this again, the key question, I suppose, will be
whether it or Weaken have a longer range.  Both have a cast time
of 6 seconds, so there's little difference between them as
pulling items, and a good deal more nuisance and expense to get
this one instead of just keeping the first one to pull.

Or if the Regent Symbol has a decent enough range, leave it
equipped all the time and pull with it instead.
