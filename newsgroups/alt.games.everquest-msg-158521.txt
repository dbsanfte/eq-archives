I may be wrong here, since I haven't tried it myself, but unless this is
something very different than a traditional damage shield, it does no such
thing.  Damage shields (such as the druid shield of thorns line, the mage fire
shield line, the bard psalm of warmth line) don't do a thing to the damage a mob
does to you, instead they do damage to a mob every time it damages you via
melee, regardless of how much or how little.  For example the high end mage DS
does 33 point damage.  An orc pawn can hit you for 1 point, he takes 33.  SORZ
can hit you for 1100 points, he takes 33 points.

What you are describing would be some sort of Rune combined with DS, where the
incoming damage would be resisted as well as damage returned to the hitter.  If
I recall correctly, though, while you are being hit with a Rune on (or DA up)
you don't deal DS damage back, so this wouldn't be possible.
