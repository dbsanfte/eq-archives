Your little experiment sounds quite consistent to what we're trying to 
accomplish.

I find it hard to twink with my knowledge of the game, but extremely 
easy to twink with hand-me-downs, farmed plat and buying stuff in the 
Bazaar. The whole point of this guild isn't just to start from scratch 
and then go back to doing what resulted in being over-geared every other 
time, but to start from scratch and earn as much of your gear as 
possible. If I look at a purchase I made in the Bazaar and consider it a 
"moment of weakness" or something I "broke down and bought", then I've 
taken a shortcut. That's what I intend to avoid. I plan to use that 
rusty sword until something I kill drops something better, not until I 
can scratch together enough money to buy something I've really got no 
business having at that level. Heck, I might even take up smithing and 
work on it until I can *make* something better. There are plenty of 
possibilities even when you rule out upgrading in the Bazaar.

We plan to *strongly* discourage any sort of farming unless it's 
tradeskill/quest related.

So at what, level 8, you were using a piece of armor that drops off a 
level ~25 mob. That's the kind of imbalance we will strive to avoid.

This is a problem we intent to discuss and work out. Playing the market, 
in my mind, should be prohibited in this guild. If we do decided to 
allow Bazaar purchases, I will suggest that doing so merely to turn a 
profit on a great deal be prohibited.

I really don't know anything about the DoN armors. Are they 
accessible/appropriate for lower level players?

I can assure you that in this guild, as I envision it, banded armor 
would be desired. However, doing so with the intent to pad your bank 
account would only compound the problem of having a bunch of coin and 
nothing to spend it on.

I should note that the list of rules I provided was abbreviated, meant 
as a list of examples and quite open for debate. I plan to have a 
meeting beforehand to settle on the particulars. Fact is, I really don't 
want any sort of situation where people have to be monitored or they are 
only allowed a certain number of purchases or anything restrictive like 
that. What I would much rather see is everyone in the guild buying into 
the core philosophy and being dedicated to it on their own. Expectations 
will be clearly spelled out. I don't know why anyone would sign on for 
this without having similar desires.
