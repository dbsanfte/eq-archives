I don't think it's possible to die in Nexus from singing the song and you
shouldn't have the POK lag.  Further, I don't believe that anyone gets
"spell doesn't stick" messages there.

But, I haven't verified this lately.  Only way to find out is to try.  Worst
case is you die...but it shouldn't be any problem whatsoever to get a click
rez if you ask nicely.
