I do enjoy playing an enchanter. I picked the best choice between me enjoying
the class and its desirability. I already group in hoh, bot, and pov regularly.
What I want though is a chance to see the end game (elementals, etc), but I'm
guessing (based on the responses I've gotten) the only way for that to happen is
for me to make a cleric or rogue or some other class that the guilds want
nowdays. The only way to see the endgame is to join a guild that's capable. I
guess I'm too late in the game to do that.
