My grandmother turned a huge profit on the house, then the condo that she
had owned, there.   I know what you mean about the insane property values
and the costs there.  Where in MO?  I used to live in Creve Coeur (St Louis
suburb) and in University City (in St Louis).  Of course, that's many, many
(many, many...) years ago.  I'm sure things have changed a bit since then
(The big news when I wasthere was the building of the first Target in the
area).

Anchors Away!  May a fair wind always be at your back and clear skies ahead.
Good luck!


BTW, if you do plan on being on FV in the future, on weekends, I have an
enchanter and my daughter has a warrior in your level range.  Of course, we
are DEs and would be hard pressed not to make a HE our dnner, but we would
try to behave.
