With the Burning Crusade released, I'd be surprised if WoW is losing
people right at this moment in time.  Not to say that it's always
going to be growing or always going to be the biggest game, but BC has
gotten rave reviews, and everyone I've talked to is enjoying it.  If
someone was going to leave, I think they would have left in December,
not in May.  According to a Blizzard press release:

"Blizzard previously announced that this first expansion set for World
of Warcraft sold through nearly 2.4 million copies worldwide in its
first 24 hours -- more than any other PC game in history had sold
within an entire first month of availability."

Doesn't sound like a game that's losing players to me...
