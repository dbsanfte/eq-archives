They're treading a thin line here. For the past 2+ years, we have had
the right to see how many people were playing on our server -- and it
is useful information. Now, all of the sudden, we don't. 

And if they don't want us to know their subscription information, then
maybe Smedly should stop dropping numbers every time he opens his
gaping jaw. I don't care how many customers they have. Those numbers
mean nothing to me. They can beat their chests on their own time. I
just want to know how many people are on my server at a given time so
that I know the chances of finding a group.
