Yep I've noticed there is always at least 2 for sale on BB.

If it really is that common then I can see the Price dropping to the 20k
mark but expect a nerf of some sort if it really is that common. Probably a
No Drop tag added but possibly a similar nerf to the LSOEE, it'll no longer
drop and a weaker weapon will replace it.

The level 56 Recommended doesn't alway mean that lower levels just get
lesser effect, some will also be unequipable by anyone below 56 (afaik there
is no way of telling if the item is like this by inspecting it) this would
stop it being much of a twink item, anyway, you can pick up an Axe of Dismay
(44/44) for under 15k now and that has only a 51 level limit.
