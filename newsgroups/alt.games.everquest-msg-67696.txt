Easy PP for a casting class, I'd not want to try solo'ing one with a warrior
below 55 (especially as warriors effectiveness is governed by their
equipment and that was the issue here in the first place)
53 warrior is not going to get a group there.
Either of the above is nullified by a partner who can heal but with out that
the Warrior is either gone find they are sitting for hour waiting for health
or running to zone.
