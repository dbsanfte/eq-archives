Why would anyone who wasn't a smith see that coming?  For all he knew
the trivial was 250+ and the materials only dropped in Kod'taz.

The 5/11 weapon is only 8% better than a WLK in my 65 BL's main hand,
and lacks the HP.  Additionally it FAR worse in the off hand, so I'd
never spend 20k (twice the price of a WLK on lanys) for 1, let alone
2.
