Help me out here...  
	I have thought of myself as a polite and respectful person in
game and out. (course we all have our bad days too)
	I had the understanding that If I was looking for KEI, and
lets give the subject a twist.... I'm too low to have it just cast on
me.       I would do a / all ench 60, and locate one in the nexus or
bazaar.  At this point I would send a tell to the individual.

"Pardon soandso,  I am in (what ever zone i'm in) and was wondering if
I could donate 50 pp to you for a KEI?  Of course I would be coming to
you, but please be aware I'm too young to receive the KEI without
being grouped."

Now, do you find this rude?  I'm in a quandary because.... well here
it is... My wife is a 53 Wizard, and absolutely refuses to respond to
OOC's or Shouts, or auctions for a xloc or port.  But if someone sends
her a direct tell, or stands in front of her in Say..   She will give
the port out.
Now, I don't necessarily agree with her...but that's how she likes it,
and she has told me many of her wizard friends feel he same way.  Not
all mind you but many.  
So, I figured the direct tell with a polite complete sentence (If I
can actually make one 8 ) ).  Would allow the individual to ignore me,
tell me to piss off, or evoke the response I was looking for.


Oh and 50 pp, I have felt was fare... 25 is too low.  100... just
seems over the top.  Yeah I know many who will pay 100.... me I cant
afford it.., and if someone said only for 100, I would do without.

LOL I remember the day when my cleric NEVER had KEI..   Yes, believe
it or not, the game can be played without KEI.  heheheh

So... What's your thoughts.
