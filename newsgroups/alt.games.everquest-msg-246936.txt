Hi All,

    I have a rokyl's channeling crystal which has extended enhancement III
on it good for a 15% increase in beneficial spell's up to level 60. Whith
the new tribute system I also have the Extended enhancement III buff
running. (forget its actual name) While I see the message for the rokyl's I
never see any type of message for the tribute buff.  Do the tribute buffs
not show a message? Or do they not stack with items? Am I wasting tribute
points or am I actually getting the 30% enhancement? Any help would be
greatly appreciated. Thanks.
