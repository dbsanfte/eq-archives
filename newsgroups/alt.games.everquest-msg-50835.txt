As far as I know such Gm quests are a myth, I've heard of people
trying to schedule them and never having luck. They are basically for
all practical purposes perm broken in that you never see one above
level 19 (if even that) and it will take you less time simply starting
over than trying to ever get it fixed.

Hmm I never heard of the selling mules set to red thing.. ahaha that
is funny. You can actually die with 200 k when lev fades? Wow.. I had
no idea weight had anything to do with short falling damage.

Yeah others casting spells on me sometimes peeves me. For example, on
the FV server I have a barb shaman who is level 12. She only has light
heal and inner fire as ways to heal (inner fire being a buff) The
thing is light heal is 25 mana and is only one faster than inner fire
while inner fire is only 10 mana and they both "heal" about the same
amount. So I mainly heal with inner fire and I guess most shamans do
until they get heal at 19. The problem is, especially on this server
it seems where you can't see class, SOME GOOFBALL well meaning cleric
or druid is always covering up my inner fire with their buff then I go
to ghetto inner fire heal and get the "won't take effect" THAT PISSES
ME OFF. I try to chastise them in the most dimplomatic way I can but
of course later another one does it. There should be a switch to not
allow other's ac/hp buffs that would overwrite yours, or perhaps a
switch to allow nothing from others but healing.
