Correct me if I am wrong (made up numbers):
I kill a mega wombat gangbanger and get 100xp.
I kill a mega wombat gangbanger and get 100xp.
I pull another mega wombat gangbanger, and someone else does massive 
damage while I am tanking. I get 50xp.
I pull another mega wombat gangbanger, and someone pulls it off of me 
and drags it halfway around the block. I get 5xp.

Hasn't someone just stolen some of my XP?
I should have 400. I've got 245.

I'm just trying to figure out how 'you get xp for the amount of damage 
you do' means that someone can't steal my xp.

Here's another example from another game, a friend is dictating to me 
right now. Ashron's Call:
My friend goes down to the beach to solo golems. He's like level 30 or 
something.
Hanging around the beach are a dozen or so level 5-10 guys.
Friend pulls a golem, starts soloing it. All the level 5-10 guys jump on 
it from behind. Friend gets about a third the experience, but no real 
benefit because level 5-10 goons were not doing enough damage 
individually to get agro. Now he has to go find another mob to kill, and 
hopefully keep it away from the vultures.
While in either case noone stole the entire kill, they deprived the main 
person of something
