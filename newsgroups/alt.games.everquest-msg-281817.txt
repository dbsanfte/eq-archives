I just find it interesting that I continue to gravitate back to EQ. EQ2 
didn't do it for me. WoW didn't do it for me. Same for Guild Wars, SWG, 
Horizons, CoH. I've tried them all, cancelling my EQ subscription(s) more 
times than I can count, yet here I am once again.

Technically I've played for a full 3 years since 2001 (according to the 
recent acquisition of my 3rd veteran reward), yet my highest character is a 
58 bard, and the majority of the targets for the raids I've been on could 
probably be solo'ed or single-grouped by the top players, so it's obviously 
not the raiding that keeps me coming back.

The fact of the matter is, I'm not really all that engrossed at this point. 
I've been away enough recently that I don't know what's going on with a lot 
of the new content. (Note to the dev's. - the new UI doesn't do a thing for 
returning players who are trying to re-familiarize themselves with their 
spell lineups - well, except make us all feel like we need bi-focals.)

I think I play EQ, in spite of its frailties of age, merely in the absence 
of anything I like better. I'm really looking forward to Vanguard, but it's 
still quite some time away. At the end of the day, when I want some gaming 
time, EQ is just the best I've got, which may or may not be sad I guess, 
especially considering the fact that I've been so soured by SoE's handling 
of EQ as to adversely affect my considerations from purchasing *any* Sony 
brand product.

Whether it's the depth of the game world, or the people I meet, or simply 
some level of familiarity, I find myself back time after time making my way 
in Norrath. Don't ask me why.
