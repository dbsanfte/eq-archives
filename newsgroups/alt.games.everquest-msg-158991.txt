> Have you tried the Gnolls in Jaggedpine?

I was going to suggest this, but decided that since my highest level is 45,
I shouldn't jump in here...

I CAN tell you that a ton of low 50's come into Jaggedpine to hunt those
Gnolls.  They aren't completely safe either, I've seen a few chars that were
red to me get their corpses dragged back to the Surefall entry point for
ressing.

Looks like I'll be able to level in Jaggedpine from 44 to around mid 50's at
least!  Tasty!
