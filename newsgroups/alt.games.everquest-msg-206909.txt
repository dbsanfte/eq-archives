I played on AB for a short while and found the attitude there similar to a
Zek server...I could have been on an RA3 server...To be fair I only played a
couple of sessions so I may have just "picked" some choice people to meet.

I did consider the move to VS when it was first offered but my AB experience
put me off the idea.
If it is still open (for a charge) I may think again....
