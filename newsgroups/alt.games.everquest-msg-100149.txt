Most of the people in this thread of fucking idiots.  If my guild needs to
start a raid and the meeting place is in Gfay, and I NEED TO GET THERE
quickly, I'm not gonna let some dumb dr00d port me to BB or Steamfont,
whether the run is safe or not. It I ask for something, I don't want to be
offered something similar.

Lets say I need to get to gfay in 5 minutes or the raid goes without me.
Then, I spend 4 minutes shouting for the port (Lets say, hypothetically, I'm
in GD and cannot walk it in enough time). Then, I get a HUMAN in a CCS,
think it s a wizard because the fucknut is anon, and I get ported to BB, and
lose my 10 plat. Thats RIDICULOUS. I asked to be ported to Gfay, not BB.
That run is going to take more time than I have, which is why I shouted for
a GFAY port and not BUTCHERBLOCK.

The time the run takes doesn't matter. The safety level of the run doesnt
matter. What matters is that the druid was wrong. The guys who started the
thread asked for Gfay, not BB. Maybe you DRUIDS shouldn't complain about
"always being bugged about asking for ports" when you obviously have enough
to time to port people where they dont want to go!

Now EVERYONE SHUT THE FUCK UP AND PLAY THE GAME!
