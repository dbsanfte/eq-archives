You guide character is not necessarily (in other words unless you want it to
be) on a different "account."

You are'nt "forbidden" to explore, in fact you are encouraged to explore,
however, there are zones that a guide is limited to accessing unless its
handling a petition.

/agree.  It is a thankless job for sure.  The only fun is the dynamic quests
that were run and performing weddings.  Unfortunately, being on a server
with Senior Guides that dont care for the job any longer, make it quite a
challenge (Im putting it lightly here).  <grin>
