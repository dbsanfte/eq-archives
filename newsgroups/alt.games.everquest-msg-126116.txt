I have a 56 bard - and have <never> been in a position where I /needed/
jboots. They might be handy at lower levels, but I have always managed
perfectly well without them. In 13 more levels, he gets a long lasting
version of selos (Selo's Accelerating Chorus), which is much more suited to
kiting than jboot speed. For the very rare occasions I needed a sow (ie
corpse runs with no drum - and even then only pre-30), the boots wouldnt be
available to him, and sow's are pretty readily available.

If he really wanted to get them, I guess its up to him, but going through
the headache of camping the AC, and depriving another non-runspeed-enhancing
class from obtaining them just seems a bit of a waste to me... /shrug
