I think if I were in charge of a new game, I'd make sure it had a good
name generator, and then *require* the use of a generated name.  For an
example of a good name generator, see the Everchanging Book of Names at
http://ebon.uni.cc/.

EBoN is cool.  It has "chapters" for various kinds of names (e.g.,
viking, latin, various races from LotR) that contain information on the
structure of names of that kind (lists of name parts, stats on
frequencies of things, and stuff like that), and generates names that
follow the rules of that chapter.
