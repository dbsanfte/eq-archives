One of the things that turned me off from SWG was when I started receiving
spam in the email system.  I *really* hope that they don't introduce an
email system.

Yes, you can use Alt-Enter then switch to another program.  Or at least you
can currently.

As for spoiler sites, Sony themselves are setting one up.  Basic free
access, then start paying for each additional type of information.  Check
one of the other posts; someone referred to it, I think.

Until the first time it tries to kill you...

There seems to be a 20-item limit on stacks; at least my goblin meat started
a second stack when the first one hit 20.

However, there's also currently a *big* problem (to me, anyway).  If you get
too much stuff, you get an "overfull" stack on your character.  And you
can't simply dump things that are in that stack.  You have to dump / move /
destroy items in your standard inventory to free up space to get things out
of the "overfull" stack.  And even if you've lots of extra space in the
bank, you can't simply put the items into the bank; you have to put
inventory items in, free up space, then put the overfull stuff into
inventory.

Collection items drop into your inventory, where you can then decide "work
on the collection", which turns them virtual, or "hold for sale / trade",
which keeps them actual.

Right now the servers are Beta 1 and Beta 2.  Makes it hard.  Me, I've got
Reyder Axeman (I found an AXE!) on Beta 1.
