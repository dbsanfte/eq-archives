It feels like more mana than a normal port to me.  Please define BFE though,
I've never seen that acronym used before.

If only it were so nice.  Yeah, I can get groups in Karnors and Velks, and
when a couple friends are on I go to Chardok with them, but I hate Velk
spiders and that's all that anyone ever does usually (need to go there soon
though anyways for shawl threads, ugh) and Karnor is ok sometimes, but it
gets boring real fast (I probably won't go back after I get VSR, except
maybe for Verix), anywhere else it's like tumbleweeds, there were 5 clerics
sitting in the front of Sebilis a couple days ago /LFG.  I guess all those
gems that they get make it worth spending 3 hours LFG.
