Hi.  A friend has a magician and I have a druid.  I also have a second 
account with a warrior.  I know the uses a druid is when PLing, but I was 
wondering if I bring the mage along, can she help in some way?  I know 
there are some great mages that read this group.  Thought you guys may know 
the ins and outs of mage PLing.

Both the druid and mage are about 54, the warrior is around 36.

Thanks,

M
