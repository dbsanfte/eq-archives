Actually it's a fairly recent reformat.  The AMD runs a bit hot, yes, but I
have the case off and a small window fan nearby.  The inside is clean, as
when I upgraded mobo/processor I also cleaned out all the dust "sheep" that
had accumulated.  It ran fine for over a month when this started.

Thanks for input.
