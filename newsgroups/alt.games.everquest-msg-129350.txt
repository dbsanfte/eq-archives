Any equipment your computer uses (including itself and the monitor) would
need to be plugged into the UPS to allow a safe shutdown. So if you have an
external modem you'd need to plug it into the UPS, the internal modem is
powered by the PC.

99.999% of the time phones remain on during a power outtage, the phone line
voltage is regulated by the local phone switch (which has redundant power),
and the line is run to your home, so no power from your home is required.

Your ISP may vary, but more than likely they too will have redundant power
and again, you do not "power" the Inernet from your home (but could
potentially extend your LAN that would require a power source).
