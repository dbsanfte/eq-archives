This changes it, but does not change the default.  That is what I want to
change, or at least if I put it on group I want it to stay there.  If I camp
to get another char it has changed back to say when I come back.  Same if I
go LD and come back.  I rarely use say, and would rather it default to group
but I can't find any place to do this.
