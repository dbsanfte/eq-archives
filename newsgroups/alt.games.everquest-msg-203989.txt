Well, That kinda depends on what you want to do when you role play.

If you want to talk funny in "Thee's" and Thou's" then you can do that
in any game or in real life for that matter.

If you want to take on the part of a rude, obnoxious social deviant
you can do that in any of these games and you will have plenty of role
models to follow after.

If you want to take on the part of an elietist Uber Master then EQ
would probably the the game for you. 

If you want to be a murdering thief then UO would be more your cup of
tea.

Perhaps you want to be a Mafia Thug and rise through the world of
Organized crime. In that case go over to The Sims Online.

Each game has taken on it's own flavor and there is plenty of room for
roleplaying in all of them. But you have to be ready to conform and
adjust to the particular social climate of each.
