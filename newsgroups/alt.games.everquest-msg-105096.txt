Dawnshroud is the new secret zone which totally rocks (oh no, secret
getting out!) My dark elf cleric got 80 PERCENT of level 37 there in a
couple hours or so with one 39 sk human. We went out in the middle
kind of and he just constantly pulled blue to yellow stuff which we
owned. While he'd go off to pull I'd con something passing and hide.
My troll sk was there later, soloing at 36 and it is quite nice. He
did not even have to fear.

The density of mobs in this zone is great and its usually 95 percent
unused, at any time of the day or night.
