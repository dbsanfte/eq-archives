It would be relevant if words only had one meaning.  They don't, so it's
not.

As an aside, if you think wimp and bitch are quite similar to one another,
you really should pull out of the whole discussion.

A bitch is most commonly used for a powerful scheming woman, hardly a timid
one.  Ever heard the terms "super bitch" or "queen bitch"?  When the super
bitch was the in thing for soaps ratings, headlines uused to announce which
was the "queen bitch" (Dallas Vs Dynasty for those old enough)

It does go though to explain where you folk are getting your ideas about
where words orginate, and the connotations which they have.
