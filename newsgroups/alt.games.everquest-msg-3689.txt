Thanks for posting to my message.  Lets just get some things straight.  I
have played since 1999, so 70+ times means I do it maybe 3 or 4 times a
month when bored of leveling my OTHER character!  I don't just have a lvl 13
Enchanter that would be pathetic.

As for flooding the market and complaining, I was only suggesting taking a
little more time to get the full value.  It has NEVER taken me longer than
10 minutes to sell it between 250 and 300pp.

Try a new sales pitch
YOURS: /auction WTS Stein of Moggok
(I have seen some good ones also.....Stein of Magook, STINE of MOOGIK, etc
hehe lol)
MINE:/auction Low Intelligence got you down?  Your friends laugh at you
because your spells always fizzle, or you always fail making patchwork?
Maybe you are tired of being unprotected fromthe diseased Zombie and need
some protection!  Maybe you like a few more hit points!  Then you need my
Stein of Moggok 300pp OBO!!

End ranting!
