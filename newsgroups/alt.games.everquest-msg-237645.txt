That's a lot closer, you're nibbling at an edge now.  A couple of
thoughts:
- Prayer, though directed to God, is neither for nor about God.
- Religious practice has no inherent connection to spirituality.
Although the avowed purpose of religious practice is (usually)
spiritual, the actual connection to any person's spirituality can
only be made by that person.  Nothing prevents you or anybody else
from engaging in behavior void of spiritual significance, whether
that behavior follows prescribed forms or not is irrelevant.
