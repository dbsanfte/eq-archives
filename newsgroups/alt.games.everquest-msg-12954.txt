A note about the mask of deception: If you are KOS because of faction hits
you've taken, rather than just because you are the wrong race, the mask
won't help you. I killed guards in Nektulos in my normal human form one
time. Another time I was in Nektulos in DE form and the guards attacked me
saying things like "Your reputation is an insult to all I stand for". Be
careful.
