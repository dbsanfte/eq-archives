Translated:

"We shoved a halberd up your ass. We didn't think you slackjawed drooling
idiotic fanboys would notice let alone object. We still think it will fit
but we are going to take it back out of your torn and bleeding rectums until
we develop a stronger anaesthetic."

*fumes*

"I have to stress it's only because the suits said so - OK? It's not like we
have stopped despising you pathetic wretches or anything, I want that part
to be perfectly clear. They also said we have to say it was an accident.
Pfffft..."

*mutters*

"Fucking crybabies... Just wait, when we have the new anaesthetic ready and
suits aren't looking, your really going to cop it..... sideways just for
good measure"
