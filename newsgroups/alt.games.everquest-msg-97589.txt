Well it had more effect back when root and snare didn't stack, and
even more before we were told when spell effects wore off. Sitting and
medding while a mob was rooted and dotted was a lot more dangerous
back then. Having the spellbook gone was a fairly major advantage -
you could see them coming and stand up before they got to you, if you
were quick.
