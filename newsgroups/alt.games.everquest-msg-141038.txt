/insert shameless mage plug here.
I deleted my high level mage in a fit of anger because at the time I thought
"I will never get the mage epic" I started a druid because the epic was
easier to get and after leveling him to 55 and getting him his epic I got
tired of him. I sold my Lodizal shield and twinked a mage, this time
starting an erudite instead of high elf. I am extremely happy now that I
have gone back to my mage. I still have mage friends who I now get to do my
research combines because I am too lazy to do it myself. I hope you find a
class your happy with... once you do you will know it.
(on a side note I already have some of the things for my mage epic, and I
have decided to go for it. I can't wait to have 2 epic characters on one
account)
