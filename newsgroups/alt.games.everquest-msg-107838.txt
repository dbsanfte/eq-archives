 Pre-kunark fists were the way to go. Nowadays most weapons you can find
are better than fists. For just starting out it depends on how much
money you have. Fighting Baton from Dalnirs is pretty good and not that
expensive anymore. Essence of Dol from Droga is a good lower-level
offhand weapon and if someone is camping Chief you can usually get these
for the price of a few invis potions since it's common and lore, which
means it rots a lot.
