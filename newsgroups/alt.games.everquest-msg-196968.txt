I have a12 Enchanter .  When I hunt and take a beating at CB why  can
I not heal myself?  And the pet gets killed immediately.  How do I
heal.  Cant hide.  Zoning?  Unfortunately people are so tuned to the
game or rude that they are not willing to help.  With my 52 Druid at
least if someone asked for a buff I was glad to do ablige.

Am I using this character wrong?  

On a diffrent note note is there a publication paper or electronic
that exsplains each character in detail on capablities?
