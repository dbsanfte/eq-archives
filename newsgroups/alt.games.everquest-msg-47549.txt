Same thing happened to me.  I was tooling around with my (then 27 level)
druid.  I was waiting for my wife who was playing a shadowknight.  I even
had levitate on so I felt pretty safe.  I had no idea!!  As soon as I zoned
into "The Hole" levitate failed and fell to 10000 hp dmg (my druid with MUCH
less).  This dropped me to level 26 (a big bummer).  Asked GM for help... no
luck.   Did "/who necro" and asked for help, but everyone was too busy.  I
ended up loosing everything to decay (stuff my brother twinked from his
50ish level enchanter).  My wife and worked hard and got some nice stuff for
me without twinking.  In a way, I felt better because I honestly worked for
the stuff.  Don't get me wrong, my brother  has since gave me a couple of
things to help me along, but it was still nice to work for some of it (still
wearing several pieces of split paw I got in SK).

Just my 2 Copper Pieces...
