Specs are 33-37, so this must have been before you dinged to 37.  From
now on (if you don't lose your level!), you'll never see a yellow or red
Spec again.

They have around 1700 HP and hit for around 90, and lifetap for
something a little lower, I believe.  However, if your group can't
single-pull them, or can't manage multiples without some getting loose,
you'd be better off taking the group to Feerott and doing the Specs
there.  There is one that spawns outside the Fear cave that you can
practice on.  Then, inside the cave, there's a place where you've got
a pair of them, so you can practice dealing with multiples.  Then you
can start keeping the cave clear.

The Feerott ones spawn faster than the Oasis ones, too, and you don't
have to worry about the occasional SG.

Oh, and there is another thing in Oasis you might consider...deepwater
goblins.  There is a tower, similar to the Spectre tower, in the lake,
southeast from the island.  It has around 7 goblins.  There are
warriors, clerics, and wizards.  They are 33-37, and have about 1700 HP.

The nice thing about the goblins is that they are almost never camped.
