Recommended level of 60 - There's a good reason my lowbie
bard isn't carrying any LDoN stuff - all the good stuff has
recommended levels that make them a poor choice.

As someone pointed out go to lucy for your damage bonus
at your level - http://lucy.allakhazam.com/dmgbonus.html

Then use

(((2xDmg)+Dmg_bonus)/2)/delay for your mainhand/2 hander to
compare weapons.

So, for main hand at level 30 with delays >15, bonus = 2
Lammy - (((9x2)+2)/2)/19 = 10/19 = .53 (rounded up)
Centi - (((12x2)+2)/2)/25 = 13/25 = .52 

After finding the best weapon for your mainhand, choose
your off hand based solely on ratio (if you have more than
one choice after picking the best mainhand weap)
