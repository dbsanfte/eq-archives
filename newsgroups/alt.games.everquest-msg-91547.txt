What the hell you talking about, Willis?  Besides, Oz isn't anywhere but
Kansas.

ANY post bitching about downtime gets that response, regardless of time
zone.  Most of us don't like complainers, and we don't like assholes like
you that mask sarcastic, pessimistic negative comments - which only prove
that you've got real issues and a really piss-poor attitude for EQ - in
"clever" comments such as this post.
