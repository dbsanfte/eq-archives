I haven't seen anybody mention them, so I'll put in a good word for
Rangers.

Rangers are a pretty good soloing class, with a wide assortment of
spells, all of which have a pretty good utility for soloing.  Heals,
Buffs, some baby nukes, Harmony, and some decent DoT's.  And more
importantly, snare and Panic Animal.  These two spells make soloing a
Ranger a breeze.  Just find an animal based mob, snare it, fear it,
and beat on it as it runs away.

Rangers are even useful in groups, if you have a real tank to soak up
the majority of the damage, since the put ranger damage on par with
warriors they can help you mow through a exp grind pretty nicely.
