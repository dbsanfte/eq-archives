Actually, I know all that, having fenced competitively in college
(sabre and foil), as well as having studied kendo for over a decade.
Yes, there is more to it than "put the sharp end in the bad guy",
although that is what it all boils down to.  That said, translating
the skills used in wielding a katana (say) to a broadsword is not all
that difficult.  It is, as I said, still a shaped bar of metal with
which you whack things about the head.  Yes, there are differences,
but I'd wager you could put just about any type of sword in my hand,
and I'd be able to use it with SOME level of skill, as I know at least
the basic priciples of keeping my balance, watching my opponent for
signs of his/her attack, that sort of thing.

For example, while practicing kendo, my instructor was very curious as
to how European fencing, specifically sabre, would stack up to kendo.
So, using a bokken in sabre fashion, I assisted with the expiriment.
It wasn't as effective as it would have been with an actual sabre, but
it DID work, and I did score on him once or twice.

And you are correct about the fictional magic weapons judging the
wielder's worth.  However, that tended to be the "big" magic weapon of
whatever fantasy it was in.  In other words, the epic quest weapons,
and not much else, IMO.  Your average Polished Granite Tomahawk is
hardly in the same class, and I would argue that any warrior, whatever
level, would be able to wield one.

A lot of this comes down to a matter of opinion.  I never liked level
limits for gear.  I just never did, it always rubbed me the wrong way.
I can come up with reasons for not liking them, but it really boils
down to that.  Not very rational, but that's the way I feel about it.
I feel the same way about the TCC, to bring this back on topic  :)  It
just rubs me the wrong way, and I want nothing to do with it.  Again,
I despise artificial level limits like that.
