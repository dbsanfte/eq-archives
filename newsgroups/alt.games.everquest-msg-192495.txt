: Due to lack of space on my C:\ drive, I am trying to migrate EQ to D:\
:
: I copied all directories, changed all references in the Registry to D:
(yup,
: I rebooted after), and fixed all the shortcuts.
:
: Now I am getting a "EQMain.dll cannot initiate" message.  Deleting and
: running EQ again does reimport (to the right spot), but I still get the
: message.
:
: Does anyone know a fix?
:
:

Thanks all.  It seems the problem is built into the last update (had nothing
to do with moving EQ to another drive).
