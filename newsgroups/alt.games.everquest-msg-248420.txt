I was thinking the same thing...a 53 with a zero in any skill is just wrong,
but especially swimming. Just going to unrest at a lower level (if you cross
the lake), or crossing Lake Rathe, or going to Ocean of Tears or Timorous
Deep should increase swimming whether you intend to or not...and as a Pally,
don't you need to access Kedge Keep for the part of the Pally epic that's in
Phineas' room? (Or is that just a Pally quest, not part of the epic?) Of
course, that's assuming you do the epic. Not everyone does. :)
