Um... no?  But then, I'd rather be in the middle of a battle getting my 
1hs up than standing in a corner casting "conjure food" every 3 seconds 
for 6 hours or so.

Defense is a hard skill to get up, true, but I've read in past posts 
that casters should be getting those skills up as well.  So if anything, 
casters are worse off.
