You do still have ports that are useful.

For example, PoK ports are great for non-KOS races, but what about Iksars,
Ogres and Trolls? I mean they can't just pop into FP.  Likewise, non-lizard
folks can't just "drop-in" on Calabis without certain death.

You still have desired ability in porting, it's just changed a bit.

I'm really glad I don't have to sit on that damned boat again...
