Who is this "everyone else"? The players have never tried it. They
just might like it. Once again you superimpose your beliefs on the
playerbase at large.

You should have tried harder, because you hit the wrong target. It's
not the fact that the casual players can't play many hours that's the
problem, it's that they want the same perks as those who do play more
hours. This leads to the dumbing down and easing up of the mmorpg.
Guess what? The casual players get bored of it just as fast as the
hardcore players do. It just doesn't work.

I judge you on your posts here, which is basis enough.

What part of "theoretical" did you not understand? EQ is now what
happens when the casual powergamer starts to win the battle. This
mature EQ is not a good model for a new mmorpg to follow. You can't
out-EQ EQ.

When the logic fails, time to try ad hominem, eh? 

The last thing I care about is your respect. Get over yourself.
