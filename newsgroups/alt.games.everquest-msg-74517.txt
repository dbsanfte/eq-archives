Thanks to those who wrote. We got him. Six times. Monacle dropped on the
sixth one. We saw him spawn at three different spots inside the fort,
(once twice) once as a wanderer outside the fort, and once at one of the
houses. Got the monacle on the last one inside the fort from a spawn
point in a hut that was *not* the one with the bbq spit.
