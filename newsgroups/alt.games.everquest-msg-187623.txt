I had one problem with XP, but it turned into a doozy.  I installed an older
version of PCAnywhere (9 or 10, I think, it was a version that could work
with Windows 3.x).  After installation, I got a message about PC Anywhere
being  incompatible with three features and asking if I wanted to disable
those features.  When I rebooted my computer the screen was black.  Since
it's a laptop, I tried an external monitor, everything I could think of with
no luck - at a certain point early in bootup the screen went blank.  To make
a long story short, I had to reinstall Windows XP and because of the way the
restore works from the company, I ended up losing a lot of settings. That
ticked me, but I'll take that as a hint to read those popup messages a
little more closely.

Other than my own screwup, XP (and EQ) have run fine.
