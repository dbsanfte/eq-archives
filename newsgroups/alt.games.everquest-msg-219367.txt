Please don't ... that only encourages them.

Heh... I actually bought it this weekend (in a box, because it was 
cheaper on the shelf then online)..  so I install it, and press the 
Order LDON button thinking that would take me to a screen that accepts 
my cd key (it was late) naively assuming that if not, it would at least 
ask for a confirmation (it was late)... but all it got was a popup 
saying "LDON ordered".

I had to phone SOE to get it undone, so I could use the box version I 
had just installed. What really bugged me though is that all it takes is 
a single click and you were committed.

they can repeat the same lameass MoD every day for the last
> six weeks, but they just kind of casually mention this. Once.

Yeah... I've stopped reading those too. :)
