I just don't get it...
There's nothing spectacular about the coldain velium weapons, unless
you're a twink rogue. For a non twink caster, I don't see how
auctioning for a plain velium dagger and maybe paying another player
5-10pp isn't better than saving up for a dagger that's slightly faster
and has no bonus stats when you shouldn't be meleeing much at all by
the time you can afford it.
