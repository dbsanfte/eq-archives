I too keep files in my c:\temp directory - for a few days or weeks
until I make up my mind whether or not to keep them.  Like you I
have my TEMP= and TMP= set to the c:\windows\temp directory which
occasionally needs to be manually cleaned out.  (I'm using WinME)

Thus far, EQ has *not* messed with the files in my c:\temp directory.
No patch messages have ever appeared there, nor any other file that
I didn't put there myself.  I don't know what is going on with your
system, but I don't think EQ is to blame.  :P
