Sorta similarly (and hijacking an old thread), the new LoS (Line of Sight)
rule where a spell fails before it's cast SOUNDS like a good idea, but
there's been plenty of times where I've started casting a 6 second spell
while a critter is not in my LoS, anticipating that it would be within sight
before the casting time was over.

But...there's been plenty of times when I hated the old LoS rules.  There's
just no pleasing me. :)
