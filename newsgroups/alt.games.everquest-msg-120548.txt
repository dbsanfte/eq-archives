>The damaged annals are what you need for the quest =P

Must apologize for taking you to task Ben. 

Decided that it was easier to get 3 pristine stingers that to continue
to fool with the recordkeeper, despite the good exp with the kills.
Took the Damaged Annal and the 3 pristine GYJ stingers to the NPC and
lo and behold, I now have a Mace of the Stoutdeacon, 8/29.

Thanks for taking me to task as I might be in the Gorge another 2
weeks with nothing to show for my efforts.

Soanso
