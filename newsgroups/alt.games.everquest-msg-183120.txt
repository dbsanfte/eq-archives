No doubt- I have seen this behavior out of them too.

I distinctly remember this incident- it ended up on the Drinal flameboard 
where one of the officers proceeded to call them whiny pussies or 
something.

I've noticed that WL/CT/Kindred have been growing...

No doubt. My opinion of you (and WL in general) is that you are decent 
folk. Same goes for the Kindred... CT I have not had much interaction with, 
but IME the "resident uberguild" (are we avoiding the name for google 
purposes? I think the name says a lot in and of itself) is a perfect 
illustration of hubris.
