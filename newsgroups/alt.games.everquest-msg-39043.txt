LOL

Thanks Mark

Ok, little history.   Guild named Horde of Steele.  A good guild.  The
problem was that it was a perpetual mid level guild.  As members gained
higher levels they left to join better positioned guilds on the server that
were more capable of doing high level raids and such.  Well, a bunch of us
(those listed below), wanted more from the Horde, so we tried to raise the
expectations.  Making it a little stricter on recruitment, not allowing
perma-newbies (those that level to 20 then create a new char), not catering
to the requests for a power-level.  Unfortunately the leader (The writer of
the post) didn't share the vision.  So, we decided to leave to form a new
guild.

However, Mark (Dough Boy and Gibrail in game) decided that our choice to
leave was a personal attack against him for some reason.  We've tried
everything to be civil, inviting him into the Collective, offering to keep
our resources available to him and the Horde, but nothing sufficed.  He
still  thinks in his juvenile way that we are setting out to  hurt him and
destroy his guild.  So, now he's decided to start spreading these things
around in a petty way of "getting back at us".

It hurts to see someone that I considered a good in-game friend stoop to
such a level.  The web address is accurate, and there is a message board
there (currently unlocked).  If you feel like checking into it just read
what we've written versus what was writen by Mark (Dough Boy).  I think its
pretty obvious who has their head on straight.

Anyway, for anybody that knows us on the server, you know the allegations
don't hold water at all.  Just wanted to try and clear the water for those
that don't know.
