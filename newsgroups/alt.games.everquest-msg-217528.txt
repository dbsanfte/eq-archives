I used to have the same system. :p Don't know how you run even at 0
clip plane in DSP. Those specs certainly won't run well enough to hunt
in those zones.

Most of us HATE having to have the clip plane neutered to run in any
zone, even if it's just the Bazaar. Leave the system specs for old
world where they are.
