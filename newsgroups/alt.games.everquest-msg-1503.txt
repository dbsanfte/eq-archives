Excellent post.  The bottom line is...KNOW YOUR CLASS.

At lower levels, of course stupid mistakes are going to happen.  I don't
think it's necessary to have to go to all the class sites and learn all
about your class before you even get to level 2.  Live & learn (or rather,
die & learn) is fine.

I hope Sergey gets the point of this...enchanters are toughest.  PLing is
certainly possible but you're not doing yourself any favors.  Ditto about
soloing.
