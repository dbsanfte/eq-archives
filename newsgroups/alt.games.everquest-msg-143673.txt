So then what constitutes a hate crime? What do you have to hate before 
it becomes a hate crime?

What if, while robbing an overweight person, the robber cries out "Give 
me your wallet you fat pig!". Is that a hate crime?

What if, in the same situation, the robber cries "Give it to me you 
wanker!". Is that a hate crime since the robber obviosly enjoys 
victimising wankers?

What if, in the same situation, the robber cries "Give it to me you pink 
shoe wearing loser!". Is that a hate crime?

What if someone is robbing a known child molesterer and cries "Give it 
to me kiddyfucker!". Is that a hate crime?

What if two football fans are having a fight over the football results. 
Football fan 1 cries "you dickhead" and football fan 2 cries "you skinny 
wanker". Is football fan 1 a victim of a hate crime against skinny people?

The problem is you have to classify what is okay to hate and what is not 
okay to hate for it to become a hate crime. This classification can 
easily be abused by lawyers when prosecuting. "My client is a victim of 
a hate crime because he was called a "fat dickhead" therefore the 
accused hates fat people". Now imagine if a fair number of the jury is 
comprised of overweight people. This could be applied to numerous other 
insults.

In my view, if there is a crime, it should be punished according to what 
the crime was and not what the motive was. Otherwise there are too many 
grey areas where this can be abused.

No. In a free country there should be no Thought Police. Our minds are 
our own and what we think is our business entirely. What is considered 
correct by one may not necessarily be considered correct by another.

This is done with the law as it is. There is no need to further punish 
someone because their motive may not be popular.

Exactly. Which is why hate crime law is stupid. Judge them on their 
actions and not on their motives.

A jury of predominantly race A is going to have a greater deal of 
personal bias against the accused if the accused is accused of 
committing a hate crime against race A. This is human nature.

In Australia we don't have hate crime laws, and I hope we never do.

I am reminded of that one South Park eposode on hate crime laws where 
the white kids ask Chef what a hate crime is and he replies something 
like "Well kids, if you are going to kill someone, you better make damn 
sure he is white!".

That sums it up entirely.
