However, be careful of "/camp desktop".  There is a fair amount of
evidence that there is a bug with "/camp desktop" that sometimes
doesn't stop the online timer for res and corpse decay.  It eventually
stops, and you probably don't lose more than 5 or 10 minutes of the
timer...but if you are planning on cutting it close, avoid "/camp
desktop".
