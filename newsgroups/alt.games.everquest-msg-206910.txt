[Caveat:  The original post looks like a scam, I do not defend it.]

I don't know where you live, but in the part of the US I'm in (MN)
$1400/month wouldn't support a family of four worth a damn.  You'd
be very poor, dependent on goverment poverty programs for health
care, housing, and food.  As for the OP, doesn't Canada have gov.
subsidized health care for the entire population?
