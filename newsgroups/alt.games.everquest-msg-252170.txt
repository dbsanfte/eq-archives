Well, they don't have a clue now, either. Maybe that's why they do OK.
Everyone who thought they had a clue went broke. It doesn't seem that
hard to me... PC gaming used to be a high profit margin industry. It's
a total loser now. So, here's what you do... you go back and look at
how things were being done in the industry when the industry was
thriving, and DO THEM THAT WAY. Hello? 

Oh, but no, they can't do that... they have all these bright boys who
think they know better than everyone else. And so they try the same
things that failed last time, and the time before, and the time
before, and expect them somehow *not* to fail this time. Keep doing
the same thing but expect different results. Pretty smart, those PC
game guys.

BTW, You forgot to list Interplay as another one of Vivendi's holdings
that is history. Or did Vivendi unload Interplay before it went
bye-bye? I confess, I've lost track of all the failed PC game
companies and who owned them.

I don't agree with this. Microsoft came to dominate productivity
software by beating their competition. They haven't *had* any
competition in the PC game category. Their would-be competitors were
well on their way to corrporate suicide before MS enterred the market.

MS isn't the company it was in the 80s. Faced with serious competition
now, I'm not sure they'd remain on top. It's been nearly a decade
since MS has released anything truly innovative. It's really too bad
there doesn't seem to be a new Microsft waiting in the wings, ready to
take down MS the way MS took down IBM in the 80s. All we got is IBM,
trying to get back to where it used to be by selling turkeys they
purchased instead of developed, like Linux, Wordperfect and Lotus.

I was a big Sierra fan in the 80s but they were on the interactive
idiotware bandwagon with everyone else in the mid 90s. That brain fart
killed a lot of game companies and left most the survivors crippled. I
don't think the PC game industry ever recovered. That was even worse
than the "PC = $3000 game console" trend the game companies have been
pushing recently.

Not "practically" - they did.

Yep. I've been feeling like that a lot the last DECADE. Which is a
double-damn. The problems with the PC game industry seem so damned
obvious, yet nobody does anything about it. I guess right up until the
day they turn out the lights they keep thinking some garbage title
will miraculously sell a billion copies and save the day.
