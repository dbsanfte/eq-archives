From the shadows, the mysterious "Rastus" <nilnil@iinet.net.au> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>Step one:  signed up to Legends service with 20 days left on regular
>account. That balance *poofed* off the ether never to be seen again.
>
>Step two:  the 30 free days from registering my Evolutions also *poofed* off
>into the ether due to having Legends subscriptions - never to eb seen again.
>
>Step three: I now have some shithead from SOE saying I now cannot move any
>characters back of Stormhammer till the 28th Dec even though my legends
>service has finished.
>
>Step four: anyone want to take a guess?

...you look for as many boards to whine on as you can?
