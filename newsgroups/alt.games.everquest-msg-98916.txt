   I'm sitting in the canoe next to Dan.  Yes, I pay for two accounts (mine
and my husband's).  Yes, I couldn't play the game for the majority of yesterday,
and I wanted to.  It's a bit inconvenient for me that they patch in the middle
of the week, since I work for a newspaper, work the week-ends, and have Tuesdays
and Wednesdays off.  Invariably, when EQ crashes and burns due to a big patch,
it's
does it during _my_ weekend.
   But I don't begrudge it.  I like that the game is constantly changing, and 
usually, IMHO, for the better.  I would like it better, of course, if the
patches
were perfect upon release.  But they aren't.  They haven't been.  They won't be.
   This game has given me many hours of enjoyment.  It's given me a chance to 
meet new people, from the comfort and safety of my home, which is a big thing to
me since I rarely go out since my husband got stationed in Seattle.  It's worth 
the inconvenience. 
   Yes, they botched another patch.  So?
