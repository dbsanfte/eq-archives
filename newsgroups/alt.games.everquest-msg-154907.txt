I get called greedy more often when I do that.  Not that I particularly
care, but it gets old after a while.  I'd rather just repay with whatever
politeness is called for.  If they pay 100+ I say "thanks!" and will
probably toss another buff on them.  At 50p I don't say anything at all.  At
25 & less I say something snide about how greedy they are for paying only
25p for a 2.5 hour power level session.
