Today our guild went in and killed Vindi and SORZ today, turned out Wuoshi was
up, and I was delayed a while rezing the dead.  Well, this was the fastest
they ever went in there, and they had no mage.  So by the time we got in
(Vindi already dead!) the see invis guards were up at the arena.  The warrior
we were with pulled one... I helped kill it.  He pulled another and promptly
went LD.  I soloed it.  Took quite a while.  Looked at the remaning two...
memmed WOT, hit them both, and then walked right in.  Slapped every mob I saw
with WOT and just walked all the way to the fight.

WOT was doubtless overkill, Pacify would probably be fine.  Neither spell
works on mobs over 55, so what I really need is Pacification, sadly a level 65
spell for me, although I'll probably be able to get a copy from a chanter who
gets it at 62.  Still, to Brell with Invis, if the mobs are busy looking no
further than their feet there's not much need for it!
