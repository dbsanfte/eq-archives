    He's the only one brazen enough to put his name out there as a plat
seller. It also helps him earn his big money, which is in arbitrage. Buy
plat from guild banks, sell to anyone willing to pay. That way he doesn't
have to work to get plat, and he has one of the biggest sources of plat in
the game as his source.

    One of my guildmates teams up with someone from another guild and farms
stuff for PA sales. He's been doing it for some time now, and doesn't have
an outside job. He recently bought himself one of those projection screen
TV's, those big expensive things. His partner lives in Taiwan, and according
to the guildmate "lives like a king". I can't see a ton of people living off
this, but I can sure see a dozen or so per server making a very good living.
