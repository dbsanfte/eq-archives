My melee DPS doesn't increase when behind xp mobs all that much
because I have a self buffed damage shield of 54 which adds up over
the course of a 2-3 minute fight if I'm tanking.  I also don't use
Stoicism to heal at all since I got Kragg's Mending which seems to be
quite mana efficient on slowed mobs.
