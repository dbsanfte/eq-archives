IIRC, alt.* groups aren't created by the whole RFC process, only the
'real' hierarchies like news., rec., and soc. use that.  Only thing
you need to get an alt. group created is a news admin who's willing,
which is why you get such imaginative groups in the alt. hierarchy
like alt.acme.exploding.newsgroup and
alt.alien.vampire.flonk.flonk.flonk.
