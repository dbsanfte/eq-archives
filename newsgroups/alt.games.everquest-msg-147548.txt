I absolutely agree with the above comments!  :-)

I'd like more new options and events for my "lowbies" to do,
not just new high end things.  But then again I like playing several
different characters on different servers to try out as many class/race
combinations as possible to see how they all feel and how they all
interact differently in groups and while soloing.

My latest "fad" is beginning to try playing the "evil" races to see how
that works out.  really different feeling when the guards in most zones
are something to fear and avoid instead of run to for help.  Got my Ogre
killed once in NK by instinctively running towards the guard tower when
I had adds on my pull.  (lol)  That'll make you remember darn quick.

And can someone tell me why anyone would want to do the cleric armor
quests now that so much better stuff is available fairly cheap in the
bazaar?
My cleric is only lev 34 but I have better gear already than all the Solusek
Ro
cleric quest armor.

Maybe it's time to re-evaluate all the class armor quests and sweeten them
up a bit?  or has the quality of items flooding the market just made them
look
shabby in comparison?  (only been playing a bit over 1 year)

Kunark inflation maybe?  I keep hearing that a lot.
