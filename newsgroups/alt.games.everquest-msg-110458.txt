 If you go into a post-awakened ST, there's already something mentioned
about dragonkind prevailing once again at imprisoning him since they did
it before. Seems to me it would be easy enough to have new Warders
assigned in preparation for his recapture. I don't really think it needs
a complete revamp, just a few story items added along with the Warders
reappearing at thier posts.
