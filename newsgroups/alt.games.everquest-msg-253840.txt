With only a little time online to test with, I went to Shadeweaver and 
started leaning hard on a Nuisance, showing my muscles and otherwise 
looking rough, to see if he'd cough up his lunch money without me having 
to lay a finger on him.

That is to say, I stood next to a stationary mob and mashed the 
intimidate key and nothing else.  Fails don't aggro at all, mob just 
stands there while I make wild motions with my hands and sword.  The 
fail message is the same as the one I got during combat, so its not 
different depending on whether its interrupted by a kick mid attempt 
(I've heard in this thread that this problem has been fixed anyway)

12 attempts in a row before I got a success.  Success gave me the mob is 
feared message, but also a 4 non melee damage message!

No skill ups, dunno if this is a skill where the target has to be at 
least cyan in order to get a skill up, or if target is irrelevant (which 
seems to be true of archery, for example) and its just unlikely per attempt.

I'd also like to know what stat, if any, affects skill up, perhaps I 
could wrangle a mind buff or an IOS or something in order to get it to 
raise faster.

And I'd really love to know if my kick skill is relevant, since raising 
it is otherwise pointless as a berserker, where Frenzy, on the same 
timer, is much better damage.
