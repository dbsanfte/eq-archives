That basically says the guild leader owns that gear. 

It is a matter of trust. If you are friends with them, you are happy
to hand down that gear, and I have been on both ends of that. So far,
the guild system has been unkind to me.

NBG works if you all trust and like each other. As a guild policy, it
is an ideal. eventually, you are going to sell/auction something you
have for an upgrade, with no malice in mind. Things get messy after
that!
