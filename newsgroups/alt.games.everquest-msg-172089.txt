That is a very good point. However, the main difference I see is the
fact that these nicknames were used for a reason. I never read the
books, but I'm assuming they were used to convey disdain, contempt,
dislike or some similar opinion or emotion. What is the motivation for
saying "wizzie" instead of "wizard"?

Kind of like if someone asked me in-game how much I was selling my
Wurmslayer for and I answered "one large" or "a thousand skins" or "a
thousand bones". There is no reason for that other than trying to be
cool.
