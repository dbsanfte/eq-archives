I started Camthiely as a cleric way back when (pre-SoL by a good 
margin).  I played her to 30th level but after passing 20th it seemed 
every level was a Hell level.  Could never get groups because they 
filled the healer spot with a druid or shaman kind of thing.  So I get 
in groups that would cost me more xp from dying then I could make up in 
a week.  Sheesh.

But I was in an RP guild and had made several very good friends (and a 
sister).  What to do.  In a flash of insight I decided that Camthiely 
would have communed with Quellious about her "ill-fated" career choice 
and through her power was changed into a magician.  Then I did what 
Lenny did, except I didn't reequip my old gear until 6th level.

Smart move Lenny.

Camthiely Carillon,
60th Erudite Arch Mage of Quellious, Morell-Thule. (Hiya Lance)
