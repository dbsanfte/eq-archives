Once I get my safety bubble into 60, I'm going to go full AA for a few 
weeks... I have a fairly solid idea of the General AA and the Class AA 
that I'm interested in, but I don't really know where to go with 
Archetype abilities. I used to be dead set on Mental Clarity, but by 
careful observation of my mana bar over the last few days I've decided 
that mana regen isn't really the Holy Grail for me anymore.

What Archetype abilities would you recommend for a Druid? While I will 
probably start grouping more at this point, my emphasis will still be on 
soloing, mostly.
