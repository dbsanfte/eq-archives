I actually did mention non-zone trains...at least, I implied it.  In DAOC
it's JUST as easy to train someone accidentally OR on purpose.  JUST as
easy.  And, like you said, once is enough.

As to someone rooting a critter on you numerous times...why didn't you move?
Doesn't take a brain surgeon to think "hmm, he's pulled to here and rooted
TWICE now...maybe he'll do it again...." :P   And no, that has never
happened to me and I probably have as many pathetic high number of days
/played as you.  I've seen too many of your posts here to believe you
handled the in-game confrontation in the diplomatic way needed.
