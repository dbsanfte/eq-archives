No, I think that either you missed my point or there is some major
misunderstanding...  I had said that I always just gave the dots that dropped
to the clerics.  Then other classes told me about reagents that they use as
well...  in this case, dots.  Since I am not well versed in every reagent used
for every spell in every class, then it seemed the fairest solution would be to
sell any dots that drop as well.  Therefore not just more for me, but more for
all and more importantly, equal for all.  

If the classes that need reagents would like to be compensated for the use of
those said items, I have never had an issue with giving them extra plat for any
buffs they cast on me.  

Most often, any cleric I've grouped with will say at the outset, If you want
*name a buff*, I will cast *whatever spell* but I would like (or I will need) x
amount of plat or *whatever stone* at the end of adventure.  

Then aside from reimbursing them for whatever they cast on me, I was making
sure to give them any dot drops as well.

All I was saying is, to make it more fair for EVERYONE, it seems I should just
be selling the dots with all the other loot and splitting it.

I don't get what you jumped on me for at all.
