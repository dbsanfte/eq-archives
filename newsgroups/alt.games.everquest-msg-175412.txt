	I think it will be another Raph Koster Production -- IE, yet another
fustercluck exercise in Theory Over Fun.  If you thought The Vision was a
problem in EQ, you should have seen it in UO.

	As for the Jedi: I flatly predict that the s3krit pr0cez for becoming Jedi
will not be nearly as unique to each PC as SOE claims, and that there will be
at least ten times more Jedi than anyone intended or desired.  I also predict
an extremely brisk eBay trade in Jedi accounts.
