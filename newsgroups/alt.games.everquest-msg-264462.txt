And this game may go gold next week? Hrm.

Does the game come to your house and hit buttons on the keyboard for
you too?

*spits*

All these things were things that made one player in other games
*better* than another. Knowing who, how, when, and where to pull,
which to kill first, what was more dangerous, etc etc. What you've
described is a system so dumbed down even an idiot can stand equal to
the best and do just as well. Three quarters of the 'fight' was
knowing *what* to do, not just doing it.

I would not be pleased with a system that doesn't give any incentive
to take a better player over a mediocre one.

Though I suspected this might be the case.


>Mezzing is still as useful as ever but seems to be much more limited since 
>only enchanters get it and there aren't that many chanters around.

Sounds dangerously close to reinventing one of the cogs of the holy
trinity.

It was too much to hope that these devs would know what were the real
balance problem spells/abilities in EQ....

Once again, this is just coming in and the game is rumored to go gold
next week?

Releasing first isn't a benefit if your game is fucked up or missing
huge elements when you do it. All you do is drive people to the other.
