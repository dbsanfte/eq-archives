I was very excited when I saw that.  Logged on, toggled badwords...which
went to on.  Seems I didn't set it to on when switching UI's, assuming
that it would retain its status.

Since it wasn't on and I was having the problem, I'm guessing that isn't
the solution to my particular problem.

On the other hand, I did have it on for the old UI, is it possible that
that status is still stored somewhere, and is what is screwing me up?
