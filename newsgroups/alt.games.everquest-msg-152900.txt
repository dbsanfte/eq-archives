I don't know, as I didn't write the code or have anything to do with
the creation of the game. I have no clue how much fixing a pathing
problem in a zone would require. And, frankly, neither do you. It's
rather idiotic to just assume that it's a simple fix. Look at it this
way, are the dead spots interfearing with your gameplay enough to make
it worth their programmers spending any more than a trivial amount of
time fixing it?

Honestly, I think it's not worth the trouble unless there's nothing
better to fix at the time. It's a minor issue. Most players, when they
know they've found a dead spot in the pathing, don't exploit it. Those
that do are dealt with easily enough. Why put resources into fixing it
that could be better spent on a more pressing issue?
