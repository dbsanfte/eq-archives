Wizards have higher efficiency nukes, just as my OP states. We aint talking
rains, i deliberetly also left out druids ability to charm ravens in PoN
etc. Leave that out of it. Lets just talk single raw spell data on 1 DD
Shock "fire and forget".
Its still too amazing that druids have this kind of fire power up their
greaves. The problem arises when druids have a single spell cold nuke that
has higher damage output than any single wizard cold nuke (raw spell data).
Wizards where about having the biggest nukes in all fire/cold/magic they
said years ago.... its just sad to see the state of the game now. But then
again, they also said they would never nerf manaburn.
