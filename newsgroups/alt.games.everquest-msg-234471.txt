As far as I'm aware, three things primarily affect AC.
1)Total worn item AC
2) Defensive level
3) Agility

The class you play also gets a multiplier on worn AC, so an item that says
'X AC' will give my beastlord an actual increase of 1.8 times X.

The multiplier is different for different classes.

Hope that helps.
