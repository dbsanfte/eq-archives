    Started smithing again, have we? :-)

    Yeah, quests like the Spirit of Garzicor will become brutal for people
that don't get that skill up now. So push, troll, push! And um, how's the
gathering of leather padding going? (If you are Wise, do as many Ornate
Chain combines as you can - clean out the vendor in The Bazaar every time
the zone is reset. Paddings are a pain to gather, and must be conserved.)

    Want me to really earn your hate?

    Even if you DO get your skills up to the point where all the starmetal
combines are trivial, you still have a 5% chance of failure. Not bad...
except you need to do this ten times in a row. So your actual chance of
success, assuming you get smithing to the point where you succeed 95% of the
time, is (0.95)^10, or a little lower than 60%. And if you fail, time to
start over!

    That's for my sister's honour!
