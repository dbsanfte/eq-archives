In the strictest terms, regarding the "newbie armor quests" that were added
post-luclin and pre-pop, there are no Iksar newbie armor quests, because the
curscale armor was, I am assuming, considered sufficient for Iksar. This is
laughable.

Not only are the sets referred to as "newbie quest armor" far superior to
curscale in many ways, they are also class-specific, thus to be even
remotely comparable the curscale armor would have to be made usable by all
Iksar, regardless of class.

As far as 7 lbs (actually stone, but that's not particularly relevant) being
ok for armor, it's not, at least for Monks, for which the armor was
originally designed, unless you believe that a monk should be at his/her
weight limit at all times once you add a weapon, making it even harder to
loot and collect even trhe smallest stash for upgrading.
