This would not be good, because after that free 30 days, the person would
have to start paying if they want to keep playing the other games, so this
would look too much like Sony using the EQ2 downtime as a marketing
opportunity.  They already have somewhat of a reputation as being the most
money-grubbing-to-the-extent-of-hurting-the-game of the major MMORPG
companies, and this would not help.
