All cleric roots work like that.  Name one for some other class
that doesn't.  As a cleric, I can never, ever rely on any root lasting
full duration.  In fact, while root/nuke soloing, I still use my very
first root ("Root") since the higher cost longer duration ones
really aren't likely to last any longer than this one... yes, if I get
lucky and the spell never breaks on its own "Root" will wear
off sooner than Enstill or Paralyzing Earth, but even without me
nuking, all three will tend to break before even "Root" will
wear off.

If there's some root out there that doesn't break naturally, I'd
love to hear about it, since that would certainly increase the
tactical usefulness of the line, an unbreakable root would be
similar to Mez as long as your target isn't a caster.
