I was wondering if anyone could tell me of a good place for a lvl 18 =
Barb Warrior to hunt in?

Mostly I have been soloing up to this point with a little grouping in =
Blackburrow and Everfrost in Calf groups....


And I thought that Warriors were a "must have" or "preferred" for =
groups, but it seems like NO ONE wants one in their group....or at least =
not this Wandering Barbarian...hehe

Maybe it's the kilt or they have "size issues" or something...lol

:-P

Anywho, was just needing some advice...

Thanks in advance

Vj
