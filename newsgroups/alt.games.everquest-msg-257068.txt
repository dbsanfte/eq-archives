As others have noted:

/target a
/loot

What I actually have is three different keys (on different hotkey sets)
depending on the situation:

/pause 3,/target a_
/loot

/pause 3,/target an_
/loot

/pause 1,/target blah1
/pause 1,/target blah2
/loot

The first two are for generic mobs, which often have names starting
with "a" or "an".  Putting the underscore at the end acts as a space
in the mob name, so you don't target PCs with names starting with A.

The third version is one that I use if I'm fighting lots of mobs
with similar names that don't start with a or an.  E.g., in SolB
I set it up with "/target greater" and "/target solusek", which
covers most of the kobolds there.  It'll target whichever type of
corpse is nearby, the other /target gives a "don't see anybody
with that name" message, and then the loot window opens.

As others mentioned, you do still have to click the items off the
corpse.  But being able to open corpses without even having to turn
to look at them can save a lot of time.  And of course it deals
with corpses in walls, etc.
