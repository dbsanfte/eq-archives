Jagged Bands are good and very reasonable,
Symbol of Loyalty to Vox Bracers are 7ac 0.3 wt 35-70p ea. Spider Fur Belt
8ac 10hp 4agi 4dex wt 0 on Prexus about 300p,
Drake-hide leggings 5ac 5dex 5cha wt 0 200p
Executioners Hood 5ac 9dex 4str wt 0.2 about 50p
Also I would head to Velious for some Cougar Claw Earrings 4ac 3str 2dex
cost 200-300p but not that hard to get I got 5 in about 5 hours off of snow
cougars
For my monk AC and weight is the prime consideration with as many stats I
can get. I would say you want str agi dex and sta to be all over 100 if you
can do it.
