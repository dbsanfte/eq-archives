What I am in essence trying to do is perhaps justify the guy's actions
from the standpoint of a newer player of the game with respect to the
concerns that face us.

I have had people do to me, when I was offering AND casting many SOW's
for free I might add, what you did to this guy. The MOST I have EVER
taken in in one session of casting SOW was about 100PP for over an
hours work. Before I got my new computer I couldn't even approach the
Bazaar because of the lag! Selling there was not an option for me.
There have been many many times that I have set up beside the Nexus
stone and cast SOW for over an hour at unsuspecting people just
standing around there and gotten nothing for it. There have been a LOT
of times I have set up asking for donations and gotten not a red cent
for my efforts.

I know it's a lowly little spell. I know everybody can go get it
someplace. I know also that people think nothing of asking for it for
free. It's kinda like a T-shirt is nowdays. You can;t hardly go out
there and sell a T-shirt because it's perceived as a give-away item
nowdays. That doesn;t mean the manufacturers should give them away for
'Donations'.
