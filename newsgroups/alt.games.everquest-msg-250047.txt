My son is the Everquest player, not me, but he can't figure out how to
change the perspective of his character from the first person to the third.
He wants to be able to see his character running around the landscape, and
not just see the landscape through his own eyes. We've both tried to figure
it out (and we even RTFM!) but to no avail. How do we do it?
