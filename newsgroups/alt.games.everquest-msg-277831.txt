My first suggestion would be to join a guild.  They should be able to help
you get your epic.
Check the ezboards ar ezboard.com and look for either your current server or
the new one.
This will give you an idea of perhaps are the most active guilds.  You can
also post for help, on the boards.

While my main character is a shaman, the shaman pets are 2nd worst in the
game.  But hey free dps is free dps.
Or as a friend of mine used to say, the shamn pet is a speed bump while you
run away.....

The spells will not compare to mages or wizards for damage, however we get
really good buffs, and can throw in
a heal or two when the cleric is busy.
