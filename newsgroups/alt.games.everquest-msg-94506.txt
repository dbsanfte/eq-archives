My vote goes for Gravity also.  It's modern, runs great on 98, Me, 2k & 
XP and has the most configurable interface I know of - there's pretty 
much nothing you can't change/move to suit your taste.

Official development has stopped, however one of the ex-microplanet 
developers is still tweaking it and adding features to what is now 
called Super Gravity.  The web URLs are:

   http://gravity.tbates.org/
   http://gravity.tbates.org/super.html

Perhaps I might change my mind when Agent 2.0 appears, providing they 
modernise it (it seriously needs it!), but until then I'm sticking with 
Gravity.

Regards,

Andy.
