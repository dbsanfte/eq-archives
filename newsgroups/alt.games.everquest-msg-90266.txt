The 4200 is more powerful than the TOL GeForce 3, at least in quite a few 
of the benchmarks that've surfaced.  And yeah, it -is- a good deal.  I 
would've liked to have seen the $100-$200 slot get filled with GF3s, or at 
least their equivalent, though.  Filling them with what are, in essense, 
GF2s confuses me.  The GF2 was a half-assed stopgap release...it was 
essentially an overclocked GF1.  The GF3 was a much better milestone, as it 
actually added a bunch of new rendering stuff (which isn't in the GF4 MX).

I think that people who buy a GeForce 4 MX, assuming it'll be like the past 
MXs...that is, same features, but slower clock/memory...are going to be 
sorely disappointed by the fact that it's less features, faster 
clock/memory.  Time will tell.
