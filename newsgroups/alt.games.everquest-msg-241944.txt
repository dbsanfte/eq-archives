Pull your head out of the sand.

I've had them refuse to refund when they billed my card *after* I
cancelled an account. It took a letter to my credit card company
notifying them of fraudulent use of my credit card before SOE backed
down from their 'no refund' policy.

Its fair to assume that getting your money back from Sony will be a
trial, considering it is clearly stated in their policy that they do
not issue refunds, and in my experience they are trial to deal with
even when they outright steal from you.
