I have posted test results (see thread subject "Beetmi: ..." that
directly and dramaticly support my assertion regarding AC (which is
more easily tested than ATK) contrary to your mistaken belief.

understand why I am not going to consider your assertion regarding ATK
is worth the time to disprove.
