Temper? Moi? Non!

Nope just enjoy collecting comments from morons is all and thanks for
the contribution. Looking hard at your post I see not one point other
than to nearly provide the perfect moronic response. Out of all the
simpletons you win the prize rating it a solid 8.5 on the drool'
o'meter.
I do suggest throwing some profanity in toward the end just to drive
the point home. Or perhaps some sexual reference just for that added
boost to get you into high nines.

You get a cookie )
