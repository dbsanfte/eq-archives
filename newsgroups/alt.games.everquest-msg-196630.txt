I found out the hard way that evil races were KOS in SS.  I was in a group
that was pulling to near the SS ent.  We became overwhelmed and my little 27
necro needed to zone.  I saw the guards rush me and stepped back into DSP
very quicky.  I was wondering what would have happened had I died!  How
would I have gotten my stuff off the corpse?  My highest is a 50 cleric.
