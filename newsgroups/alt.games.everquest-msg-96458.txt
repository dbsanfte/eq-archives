God, those lotuses are a pain in the ass.  AND I'm pretty sure they see
through invis.

I'm of the opinion that if you get summoned by one and you aren't strong
enough to kill him then you will die. Even if he can only summon every 30
seconds (seems to be that), that's not enough time to get out of the zone.
You can keep running away and pray to god someone pisses him off before he
kills you, but that's unlikely.

Plus, of course, his 500+ nuke.  Youch.

Hmm, just got to thinking.  If his summons IS only once every 30 seconds and
IF you're a cleric or enchanter you MIGHT be able to wipe his hate list with
Atone or Mem Blur.  I wish I had thought of it earlier. <g>
