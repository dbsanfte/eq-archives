Yes I was exagerating too. Humour is for everyone, isn't it?
That is why I added a smiley: ;-)

I firstly thought dstep was serious and then I thought to myself it 
was not important if he ever was, but you must admit dstep that you 
did not make your post very clear about that.

I wanted to make a following post for the explanation (that I will 
put here, hoping this post will be uploaded) but it has not been 
posted (or it will appear soon, but several days since I post seem 
a very long delay, isn't it?)

I have used on purpose the very same words of some players that say 
me -seriously- ingame that they cannot group with me because I am 
French (that is an example) to show that it is really ironic and 
NONSENSE. Since Remingtone Stone and you have explained to me what 
you did intend to mean in your respective posts, I have well 
understood all this thread is humoristic.
As well as I heard this words in the "mouth" of other players 
talking together. I never take it for anything else than humour.

There is no reason to read my post with another point of view, 
really, that is why I used this "ingame"-style, with emotes and 
character talk, to respect the idea that we are talking about a 
GAME and not of the reality.
(though I first did a mistake by thinking you were writing your 
sentences seriously: I have recognized this)

My words were ironic, I hope you did not thought I was serious or 
hurt, I DO have sense of humour.

dstep: sorry if you ever thought I wanted to hurt you, I did not.

P.S. There was an connection problem with my news server, that's 
why you can read a first post that is not achieved; quitely in the 
same style that the one we are talking about; I firstly thought I 
had not posted it, so I have writed another one.

I do not attack the PLAYER, only the CHARACTER, be sure of this.
I do not know you personnaly, my education does not let me 
personnaly criticise you, it would be a serious mistake.

P.S. In the same way, I totally assume you can attack my character, 
it is clear in my mind. I would be hurted if you attack myself, the 
player, as a French person or anything else related to my reality.
If anyone made bad jokes on the druid I am ingame, I would accept 
it and reply in a ingame style, as I did.

That is what I wanted to point out.

(I read this post again: I am not sure it is clear; in my mind it 
is)
