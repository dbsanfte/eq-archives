I thoroughly agree with you and appreciate your insight. I'm probably
the brokest Cleric on the server, but my goal is to solo to 14 to pick
up the new spells. Bind Affinity and Healing are already bought and
stored against inflation. I've got 60 plat to buy Expulse Undead, Symbol
of Transal, and some Cat's Eye Agates. After that, I intend to save for
some WIS items.

Actually, I haven't much choice in soloing right now due to VooDoo
Banshee and 3dFX troubles I can't shake. I'm definitely gonna get a new
card someday. All the latest drivers don't help either. I'm growing
tired of looking at billboards instead of trees through my Primary
drivers. I've tried grouping, but too many 3dFX video problems makes me
unreliable. My computer has frozen in battle and even ON THE WAY to
battle using them, so I'm resigned to soloing to 14 anyway. I just pray
that Medding gets faster by then.  :)  Thanks again for your insight.
