I hear a lot about enchanters using Charm as a method of fighting.  I have a
lvl14 enchanter with 120INT and 130CHA.  Whenever I try to Charm, let's say,
a 'blue' creature, it only lasts from 5 secs to 30 secs.  If I send it after
another creature and Charm wears off...I now have 2 angry blues after me :(

Do I need higher CHA for Charm to be more effective or is there something
else I'm missing?

Thanks.
