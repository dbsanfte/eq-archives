Is it just me or are there others out there who are "scared" of dungeon
zones?I think I know where my phobia came from.The first dungeon zone I
ventured into was Befallen.All the skellies were green so I walked around
opening doors cautiously exploring(I'm sure you all see where this is going)
get to this platform....NOT A PLATFORM!! AHHHHHH....THUUUDDD!!!
I fall through the well to the 3rd level.
Confused and dazed spin around to see how dead I am.....very dead.I don't
get 5 steps before the mobs make short work of me.That was the first time I
was facing loosing every thing I owned.I /ooc'ed for help and a high level
monk drug my corpse up.Ever since then I get this uneasy feeling entering
any dungeon.
