Bow kiting in the teens keeps my level 15 ranjah maxed with archery
just fine.  Trick is probably where - a lot of zones aren't
necessarily suitable.  Paludal being one.... (I know the exp is great
but I just loathe that place).

The last few levels I've dumped him down to NK on each ding and bow
kited around the tower (SE of gypsy) for 10 or 15 minutes.  I about
fell over the first time I got a bow-crit of 52.  =)  I've also
bow-kited a bit on the easier sides of LoIO (a lovely ghost town these
days).

Anywho, that's how I'm doing it.  Granted - bowkiting is terribly
expensive for a non-twink.  I've spent so much money on fletching
(just over 100 skill so far) to keep supplied with arrows that I had
to hit up a guildie for a loan to buy my latest batch of spells.  But
now I have root, so I can just plant and twang too.
