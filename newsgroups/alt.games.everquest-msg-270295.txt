I used to love going to the noob zones and buffing them. Hiding goodies on
rats and snakes was always fun too. That won't work at all in EQ2. It's
like they've sterilized it to the point where everyone *has* to look out
for themselves only. For me that kind of kills the community. I've gotten
groups before from being helpful while just passing by. In EQ2 it looks
like that won't happen.
