Oh sure, gloat about it hehe.  I had pretty good luck on missions,
cities were a bear.  Was playable from shortly after release so long as
I remembered to log out and reboot once an hour or so, else it crashed
with sometimes bad consequences.

Constant opportunities to press the lever and get another pellet.  So
long as I kept focusing on the lever and the pellet tray I was happy,
though once in a while I would glance up and realize that I was in a
cage and beyond lever and pellet there wasn't anything else.

even if you liked what you had before.
