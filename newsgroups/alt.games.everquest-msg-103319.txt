The problem with alcohol is that it is so pervasive and social
accepted, and "power drinking" is even socially acceptable in many
circles (ie. College) that people can very easily build a dependency
without even knowing it.

Not to mention that physical dependency doesn't happen at a fixed rate
for everybody.  There is even evidence to suggest that some people
might be genetically predisposed to be come alcoholics.  Or was.  It's
been some time since I did any reading on the subject.
