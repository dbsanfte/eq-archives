My guild has killed the Restless Burrower a few times now.  Last time,
an uber guild decided to race us.  People were still making their way
over when the guild trained the fish on us.  With no chanters there
and me, the only cleric, it looked like we lost the spawn.  I died
eventually to the fish (not good to have aego run out right before the
battle) and through raid chat heard that the other guild was giving
up.  In their race, they only had one group there themselves, while
the rest of our force finally showed up.

However, one of their members, a wizard, stayed behind.  For some
reason, our debuffs kept wearing off!  Hmm.  The shaman was told to
keep castiing slow over and over.  Clerics were running lom but with
mod rods managed to keep one tank up through most of the fight.  

Fortunately, we won, and the wizard gated out :).  Apparently, RB
despawns 30 minutes after first engaged, sorry to hear you lost it
after being soo close.
