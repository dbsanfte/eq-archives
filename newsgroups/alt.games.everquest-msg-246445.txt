I guess it is. I find raiding easy and dull. When they go well they're 
sleepers. When they go badly there is usually little you can do to save 
it. The battle is truly won in the planning stages...as long as you go 
in with the right tactics and nobody screws up badly you'll win.

I guess a 'raid' of 10-15 guys 2-3 groups is still fun.. But once they 
hit a critical mass over 20 or so I'd rather not be involved because no 
one is particularly relevant anymore... at 60 or 70... whats the point 
of even showing up?

That said, raiding starts long before 65th. 46th is reasonable to start. 
And once upon a time when the population was young you could do 
multigroup activities starting around 25. Once upon a time Mistmoore and 
Sol A were good places to 'raid'with a couple groups. It sill is ... 
except their really aren't enough people any more.
