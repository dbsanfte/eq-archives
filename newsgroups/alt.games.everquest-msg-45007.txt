Relaxed faction?  Having been a victim of a Lucin screwup (do the
words "tell me when to zone out" mean nothing?) I know full
well that those guys can hardly be described as "relaxed" to a lot
of people.  I'd guess GFay, which has easy access to wizard
and druid ports, and lots of guard free leg room in it so you don't
have to worry about getting dead so often.

Presumably magic items imprint on their current weilder, and won't
transfer until he's dead.  Since no player ever dies, just pops back at his
bind spot, the items never again enter the common pool.  What is
this, Riverworld?

ooc and shout currently use whatever language you are speaking... the
fact that 99%  of the people playing use human for everything means
you may never have seen this at work, though.
