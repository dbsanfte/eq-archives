    Actually I alternated Glimpse and True North... but you have to stand
south of the half elven maiden, then.

    Hm... a remote sight probe that moves at Spirit of Cheetah... not meant
to be scouting?  It's specifically designed for scouting.  What on Norrath
did they intend it to be used for?

    Maybe they intended it to use to get newbies killed who attack it near
guards.  Or maybe they intended it to be a pulling spell, since mobs
apparently know not only who sent the eye... but where that person is
sitting.
