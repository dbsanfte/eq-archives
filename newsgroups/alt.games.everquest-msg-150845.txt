/as works, although I suppose its more fun to type out /ass

Personally, every hotkey page on every character has 8 as /assist,
dating back to my use of the original UI, where keys 7 8 9 0
were all invisible.. but I knew what I'd put on each cause it was
there on every page.  Messages that changed from page to
page were in the 1 thru 6 slots so I could tell what I was about to do.

I don't hard code in an assist off the MT, since I'm very frequently
swapping target from MT to mob to whatever the mob has
targetted and back to his target.... I do have a special setup
that allows me to lock the MT in for targetting by pressing the
e on my keyboard, so I can e 8 to assist MT again if my
assist chain has made me wander afield.
