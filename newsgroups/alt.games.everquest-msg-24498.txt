I am a L16 human chanter trying to do this quest, and without help of a 
teleporting friend it has been a lot of work running around the length 
and breadth of the entire world of Norrath. I am now about ready to go 
to Oggok and turn in the book but reading some previous posts about this 
quest, I am having doubts. 
I have illusion de and alliance spells of course, so with these 2 
spells, can I reliably get a stein from clurg? Does Clurg has to con 
amiable to me for it to work or will indefferent or kindly be enough?

Please help I would hate to have spent hours running aroud, dying once 
or twice in the process, and not get a stein at the end of it.
