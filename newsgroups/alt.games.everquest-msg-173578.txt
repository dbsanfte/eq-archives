Exactly. You are dependable for your job and your family. The kid is
dependable for the guild. Your job and family rewards you, the guild
rewards the kid.

Would you think it 'fair' if a kid who did summer work at your place
of work got the same 'shot' at promotion and became your boss because,
hey, he was there on the day the position became available?

No? Well, raiding guilds run on the same principle. They reward those
who contribute the most heavily. If you dont place the same priority on
the guild as the kid, the guild doesnt place the same priority on you
as the kid.
