I just checked something.  I thought this guy sounded familiar, so I looked
in my email archives.

He sent me a copy of his log back at the end of May.  There was a bunch of
garbage in the middle of it.  It looked like something appended an
executable at the end of the text file, and EQ continued adding log entries
after that. Once I removed the garbage, everything worked fine.

I sent him a note telling him what the problem was and how to fix it.  I
didn't send him a corrected log, because he may have continued to play and
gotten more log info.  I used Wordpad to fix it, I assumed that he'd be able
to do the same thing.  Never heard anything back, so I figured he had fixed
it.

Guess not.

So once again, here is how to fix your log file:

Just open the file with Wordpad (or something else that can handle large
text files) and delete the garbage.  It's about 3/4 of the way down, you
can't miss it.  Then save the file.  Make sure you save it in text format.
