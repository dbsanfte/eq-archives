On Howard Stern's show today, they were talking about the serial
sniper in the Washington, D.C. area and how they found a "Death" tarot
card near the scene of one shooting and how tarot card readers were
upset because they thought people would associate tarot card readers
with serial killers.  Howard started ripping into them because he
thought tarot card readers were scam artists and he started
impersonating them, saying something like "We only rip people off, we
aren't serial killers and we resent having our sterling reputations
ruined" and Artie Lang said, "We're the new Scientologists, dammit!"
