>Is anyone running Luclin with all the options turned on?  

To be perfectly honest, I've turned everything down to their minimums.  Not
only do I not find the new characters or textures all that interesting, I can't
justify the peformance hit.

Everquest wasn't fun for me because it looked good or bad, I just enjoyed the
interaction with so many players.

I run with textures on LOW, all options off, all new character models off.

>How well does it run and what kind of a system do you have? 

Celeron 700
256MB of RAM
Kyro II 64MB Video

Could I run with more textures on?  Yup.  I can run very well with the textures
on medium and some of the new models on (about 12 - 15)... but I would rather
have the extra frames in battle in a full dungeon.

Losing a couple frames can mean life or death sometimes :)
