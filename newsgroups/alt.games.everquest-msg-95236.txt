Shhh, it's a secret:  I don't even -have- a monk.  My main's a
high-level cleric.

See, it was the comment like "Leave the keyboard and the only
one to blame is yourself" to which I was responding.

Let's say I have a mage:  in some areas, one can -safely- go AFK
for a period of time because there are no wanderers to disrupt
the camp and/or the pet can deal by itself with any spawn.  If
a_random_druid kites over the top of them, they're the one at
fault, not the mage.

Let's say I have a druid:  in some areas, one can -safely- go AFK
for a period of time because there are no wanderers that see
through Imp. Sup. Camo.  If a monk (or anyone else) brings up
a see invis mob and feigns, they're the one at fault, not the
druid.

And the druid has -less- of a defense than the mage:  the mage
pet and the mage are both visible and easily avoided.  The druid
is invis'd and can't be seen.  So, see, we actually agree.  It's not
the fault of the mage for being AFK - it's the fault of the idiot who
couldn't (or wouldn't) go elsewhere even though the spawn was
taken.

Saying it's always your fault if you go AFK is stupid.  I can med
AFK with my cleric perfectly safely in Lower Guk from no mana
to full while waiting on a spawn I can solo (frenzied ghoul, for one.)
There are NO mobs down there that see through IVU that are
KoS to me -unless I'm trained.-   If someone trains me, they're
the one at fault, not me for actually standing up and going to grab
a sandwich (or whatever.)

Does the mage (or the druid or me) have some responsibility?
Well, duh, of course they do.  It's not that hard to Gate and/or
root a mob or whatever to defend yourself when you get
trained.  But am I going to rez the poor smuck who trained me
when I run back down to get my corpse?  Not a chance.  There
are ways to leave the keyboard in safety in plenty of places and
only an idiot says that being trained - accidentally or not - places
no blame on the person doing the training.
