Yes, that is a legitimate drawback.  However, you only have to enchant the 
metal when you're making stuff you actually want to use or sell... most of 
it gets sold straight back to the merchant.  So you only have to find a 
friendly enchanter occasionally. (and we -are- out there...  Sure, it's 
making competition for myself if you ever get up to 250ish, but I'm 
usually just amused enough by the novelty of a non-chanter jeweler to want 
to be helpful. :) )
