Is it just me or has the patch that never ends turned into an upspike of the
September?

Lurkers outposting regulars
Flamers appearing from the shadows and saying "shut the fuck up" to anyone
who even tries to add some humor or regularity to the group
Everybody and their brother posting "ITS UP!!" and 5 minutes later "ITS
STILL FUCKING DOWN!!!"
More idiots than ever before
And in all this mess, not a single freakin useful post...  (mine included)

And on a side note, its bloody hilarious to me since I can't play even if
the servers ARE up.
