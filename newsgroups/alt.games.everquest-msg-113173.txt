There is nothing hard about the cleric epic.  Its painfully easy.  There are
two long camps that could be done by a group in their 30s, then a once a EQ day
spawn kill that takes one group of 50s, then a once a EQ day spawn kill one that

takes 2 groups of 50s, then a short timed spawn one that takes a decent sized
raid
in its 50s, then a long semi random timer one that takes (I hear) another raid
force,
capable more or less of killing Naggy... but post 52's are allowed.

To be honest, there is probably no easier epic to get.  Except that the pop rate

on the final step is set at higher than clerics getting the other steps done.

When the epic was first in game, it would have been possible to complete it
within 3 days (assuming you knew what you were doing and had a guild full
of ready to go 50s.)

However, the next cleric shows up with his steps all done in an average of two
days.
This means =he= has to wait an average of four days for his.  Next cleric shows
up two days later, has to wait an average of five days.

WHile in the short term this process isn't bad, and rewards those who were ready

early on, in the long run it results in crazy things like a list 75 long and
growing
steadily longer (when I joined list it was only 65 deep)

To me, lacking the Vision(tm) it seems clear that a nudge in the drop rate as
this
phenomenum became visible (say with the list at 2 months and growing) would
have nipped this in the bud.  However, at this point that nudge would only
leave the list steady at almost a year... to get things down to a
sane-if-annoying
month long would require overcorrecting so the list shortens daily and then
correcting back up so on average the list is steady-state at the desired length.

Failure to do something of this nature suggests that the "desired length" of the

list is something longer than the current 9 months.

Or that Verant =wants= to see KS fests

Or that they simply have no idea how to manage their creation in terms of
nudging things around to keep them difficult (if thats the word when time
is the only difficult part) but not outrageous (which frankly is the correct
word
for a nine month wait step no matter what you think about this making things
"epic")
