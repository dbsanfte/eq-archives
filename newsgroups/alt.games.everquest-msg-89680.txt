Hang on, isn't it prince Thirneg in PoG that kills people who say
phat lewts? Don't you have to hail the lunatic?

'I promise to hail Sirran the lunatic'

Naw, can't see that included in the vows...

Oooh, from one of my fave screenshots:

xxxxx says, 'I am here for phat lewts'
Prince Thirneg begins to cast a spell.
Prince Thirneg says 'You shall find no 'Phat Lewts' here!! Your
selfishness shall be your downfall!!
xxxxx has been slain by Prince Thirneg!
You tell your party, 'AAAACK!'
yyyyy tells the group 'OMG! what happened?'
You tell your party, 'He said he wanted lewts!'

This, after I warned him that one of the mobs would DT him for
saying just that... sigh...

Rune, who shall find no 'Phat Lewts' in PoG

Hang on, I shall! I have two of the four Idols needed for that
phat bracer! Woohoo!
