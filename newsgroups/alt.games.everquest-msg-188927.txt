You will not evade me, "Richard Lawson" <nouma@msn.com>:

Glad you got a piece of loot you really wanted :)

I needed to upgrade my boots, and had my eyes on the two NToV druid
boots: Boots of the dead dream, and Tvenken's slippers of silence.
Dead dream has less hp, less wis, more ac, more sta, and affliction
efficiency 3, and a nice grey color. Tvenken has no effect, 5 MR, 5
less AC and 5 less mana, plain leather graphic. So, I set my heart on
getting boots of the dead dream. First time we kill Feshlak, the boots
drop and a beastlord gets them for 30 points while I am sleeping.
Second kill, another druid vastly outbids me for them, Third kill, no
boots. Fourth kill, Fesh drops almost everything but those boots and
the sky watcher's monocle (which I also want, yay). Last night he
finally drops the boots again, I win them with 80 points, happy even
though the usefulness of affliction efficiency III is pretty much
history for me by now...

...and the fashion junkie discovers that they have the plate graphic,
which she hates for its clunky Luclin look on a female wood elf in
leather leggings :) Realizing you should have set your sights on the
other boots after all: priceless :)

Oh well, maybe one day I'll get ornate. Till then, something needs to
be dyed to minimize the Luclin clash of textures.
