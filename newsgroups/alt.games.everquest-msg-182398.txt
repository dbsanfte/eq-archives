I vote for Vah Shir beastlord.  Every time I go on to play my main lately, I
wind up going back to that alt.  He's awesome.  As for twinkage, all I gave
mine was a fighting baton, a treeweave, and a bear claw glove (or something
like that, cost about 100pp) so I can keep my hand-to-hand and my 1HB skills
in working order.  It would fit well within your 2k budget, and that setup
makes a lot of difference.  But the best twink you could do for your
beastlord, should you play one, might be to buy KEI.  All it will hurt,
skills wise, is meditation, and that will catch up quickly anyway.
