I definitely don't want to hear about "broke" clerics. I have died twice
recently in one day due to the feign death bug , which has once again reared
its nasty head. Both times I was in a zone that was not a populous zone. At
my level , experience is just too hard to get to not get a rez , so I did
what I always do, look at all the available clerics above 49 in the game and
started offering money to the ones closest to me. I ended up paying 550 pp
for 2 rez's.  300pp to one cleric, and 250pp to another and I got
transportation for them. Now I realize it took a little time for them to get
there and time to recover the mana, but let me tell you, as a monk that has
struggled to make pp my whole career, I'd be happy to zone a couple times to
make that kind of pp. Every now and then , if a cleric is in the same zone
already as me, I've gotten a free rez but normally I've paid more than a
100pp every single time I've gotten a rez, and for the last 15 levels or so,
200pp has been the norm. And I never get a symbol buff without giving the
cleric a peridot back, except in guild raids where they give clerics all the
cash drops. If you ask me , clerics past 39 have one of the best ways to
make money in the game.
