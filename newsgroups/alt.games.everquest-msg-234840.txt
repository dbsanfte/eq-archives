Disputation: I have more droppable gear than I can be bothered to sell
so I give it away. I have no need of funds. I am entirely unharmed by
no drop gear; in fact, I benefit from having less competition for it.

Even were it the case that I needed money, no true low level could afford
the prices that would be of any significance to me; see elemental tradeskill
bows, etc, as examples.

I dont see your point really. I have a tonne of gear I give away to my
personal friends. I likewise get gifts from my friends. Its a very small
tight knit circle based around a small power elite - patronage, almost.

So?

On a broader note:
Firiona Vie has very little no drop gear. Anyone there care to comment
on the result?
