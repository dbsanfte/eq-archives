    Is that self-buffed, or unbuffed? My CLERIC is 950 AC / 3000 HPs
self-buffed, and I wouldn't tank with her for more than short periods.

    That sounds all fine and dandy, but does that mean that ANY situation
where groups are expected to come out ahead has no risk? So every XP grind
spot in the GAME has "no risk"? And if that's the case, then what, exactly,
is reward? You might want to re-visit that definition.

    I seem to recall some nice drops coming out of The Grey that weren't in
other zones. And given that I've already seen at least one new,
easy-to-obtain permanent EB item, I doubt the second requirement will
present much of a challenge.
