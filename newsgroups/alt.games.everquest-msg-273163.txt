Is that the correct interpretation of 90% spell slow? Just curious... 
I'd assumed it would just mean a spell would take nearly twice as long, 
not nearly 10x as long.

Ie it would take x+px

So a 3 second spell, (x=3,p=0.9) would take = 5.7 seconds... a 
signficant difference, but nowhere near the league you are talking.

Your talking: x/(1-p) which would be 30 seconds.
