Exp is harder and harder to come by as you level up.  Assuming this trend
continues up to 65, we may be looking at a weeks work in the difference
between 2% loss and 4% loss!

Personally, one of the best ideas I heard suggested was a continuation of
the epic quests, requiring the epic to trigger the next step, and resulting
in
an upgraded version of the things that put them back at "wowser" status.

Here's an alternate plan.  Make the epic take on the stats of whatever
weapon is most "upper/left" in inventory, plus some epic bonus.  This would
stop warriors paladins and.. hmm actually I can't think of many classes that

actually equip their epics for normal use anymore.  Druids, Enchanters,
Wizards, thats about it.
