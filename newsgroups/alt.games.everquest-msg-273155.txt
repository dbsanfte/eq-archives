Is this a question or a statement? (If you use a period its a 
statement... if you use a question mark its a question. Using both just 
indicates you are an idiot.)

Why mention guns at all then? Just an spurious tangent along the first 
line that popped into your little peanut? Allow me to suggest a 
recreation of your thought process:

 "Uhh..ummm.. Guy blames EQ for a suicide?... huh huh huh... that's 
stoopid! EQ is not for to kill peoples, but guns is made for that! 
That's pretty clever! I should tell the world!! Uh wait... world 
probably already knows guns are for to kill peoples; its bleeding 
obvious even to me and its totally not related to topic that I... 
Oops... I pressed send. They shud put a confirmation box on that there."

> dumbass?!

This coming from a guy that resurrected a 2 year old thread. And you 
double-posted too.

The mental giants have arrived.

I don't usually go with ad hominem, but you haven't posted anything 
worth responding to. My only error was in responding to your post in the 
first place, instead of kill-filing you immediately.

That at least has now been fixed.

plonk.
