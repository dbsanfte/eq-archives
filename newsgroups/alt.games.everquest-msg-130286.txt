Ah, but HOW capable?

Today there are about 13,000 'lifers' in the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) and
about 100,000 draftees doing their 2-3 year tour of duty, say 120,000
solders under arms. The way the IDF works is remarkable. That number,
120,000, can be increased to 650,000, deployed in combat, on three fronts,
in 72 hours. The first quarter-million arrayed in combat in 24 hours.

Admittedly much farther away, but it took the U.S. nine months to get
250,000 troops to the Persian Gulf. Israel can field two-and-a-half times
that number in three days!

The IDF can field 18 divisions of infantry and armor. The U.S. has ten army
divisions and two Marine division, so the IDF is 50% larger - in ground
forces - than the U.S.

The IDF can fight a sustained war, without significant resupply, for 30
days. The best endurance NATO ever had was ten days. Every gas station in
Israel has an additional 5-10,000 tank reserved for army use. Every one.

The air wing of the IDF has over 600 combat aircraft and lots more support
airplanes. The IDF even has three submarines (although those won't be much
use against Palestinians).

One snitch recently reported Israel has over 400 nuclear and thermonuclear
(H-Bombs) weapons.

In the best of all possible worlds, Saddam Hussein should lob one or two
more scuds at Israel and the U.S. should stand back and watch.
