Here's a thread for great finds on vendors. :-)

Last week I found:
- Evil Eye (somethingorother) bag (75% WR), ~8 plat
  [ Actual value: approx. 400-600 plat, I think ]
- Centi Longsword, ~63 plat
  [ Actual value: approx. 2000 plat ]
- Centi Shortsword, ~8 plat
  [ Selling for 150-200 plat ]
- Fingerbone (somethingorother) loop, ~580 plat
  [ What's this worth, BTW? Nobody would answer me, I wound up selling
    it for 1200 plat. Permanent see invis effect and some other nice
stats. ]
- Shadel Bandit Ring, ~7 plat
  [ Selling for around 1000 plat; should have kept this but sold it to
    a guildie at cost. ]
- Archaeologist's pack, ~2 plat
  [ Worth around 200-400 plat, I think ]

All on *one* vendor. Also a bunch of other reasonably good stuff.

Also last week, I found a copy of Stun Command on a vendor for around 7
plat.
Currently selling in Bazaar for around 3500-5000 plat. (As a 53 cleric, I
plan to keep it however.)

I should point out that vendor mining is not, in any way, a profitable
activity. No way, uh-uh. Move along, these are not the droids you are
looking for.
