Since you've already gotten lots of good technical advice to your specific
question, may I offer an alternative?
Skip Lake of Ill Manners entirely. Yes, you could level to thirty and beyond
there, but it can also drive you insane. The incredible distillation of tightly
packed total assholes in that zone can make it almost unplayable at times. The
zone frequently has more than 100 people in it on most servers, and the loot is
crap.
  Take your level 18 monk up to Highpass and fight in the orc and gnoll groups
until 21 or so, then move into High Keep.  One of the best zones in the game
for 20-30 IMO, with plentiful mobs, merchants, guards, and banking all in one
small area. You may, during crowded times, have to get on a waiting list for a
guard room group or such and solo some smaller stuff in the meantime, but it's
worth it.  There are also some excellent faction quests which can be done
there.
Good luck.
