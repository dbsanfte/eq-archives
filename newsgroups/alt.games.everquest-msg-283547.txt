Yes.  In each wing there are "lesser" versions of the elementals.  If
you are 65 they will /con light blue.  They were almost certainly
included for the sole purpose of being DC pets.  The nice thing about
the elementals in BoT though, is that none of them summon, even the
higher level ones.  So if you have a reliable snarer you can keep one
of the more dangerous ones charmed with relatively low risk.

I think BoT may well be the only zone that has reasonable DC'able,
summoned mobs.  Maybe HoH or PoV, not sure.
