Well haste isn't always just about "making the fight go a little faster", on
a raid it can be the difference between life and death, when you need the
mob dead NOW, i.e ae dragons, queen in chardok, VS with his 1.5k lifetap

My first ever VSR was 2 groups, and total overkill. I don't remember how he
cons, VS is 55 and I don't think VSR would be any higher - I've also been on
VSR kills where I (a monk) has been the tank for the battle.. he really
isn't a super tough battle
