The flourescent lighting issue, afaik is sort of like the camera 
recording crt issue... where if they aren't in perfect sync you get 
picture roll in the recording... similiarly flourescent lighting has a 
flicker rate of its own, and when it combines with your monitor you see 
a flicker artifacts as they go into and out of phase sync with 
eachother. (terminology?? im not an electrician)
