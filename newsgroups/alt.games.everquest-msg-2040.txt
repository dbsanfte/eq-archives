It's an interesting concept...

Although, the only way to have "true" RP on the server is for there to
be some form of non-duel PVP allowed.  And we allready know how
dedicated Verant is to PVP.

That said, if they'd allow people to transfer one character over from
our main accounts, I'd very seriously consider the option.
