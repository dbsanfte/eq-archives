Hmmm - another thing you can do is use the /viewport command.

Say, for instance, that you're running in 1024x768.  If your chat window
is 125 pixels high, it's blocking the bottom 6th of the screen.  Anything
drawn in that portion blocked (the dwarves next to you).  

type /viewport 0 0 1024 643 and those dwarves are drawn above your 
chat window.

the command is 
/viewport left top width height 

When you do this, you aren't ocluding anything (the way you are if you
simply have windows over the action) it simply draws the action in a 
smaller area.

Because my hardware isn't the best, I've used it to create a 800x600
window in the top-middle of my screen, with my chat windows and group/
personal/target health under it, my hotboxes and spells on one side and
buffs on the other.
