yeah I do wish ppl would shout warnings b4 spawning these mobs. I was
wandering through East Karana the other day with a necro friend tracking
down Tarbul Earthstrider for a little revenge. When all of a sudden I see
the DE corrupters msg and then the 2 reavers pop right on top of me both of
them harm touch me and then work on the final 100 or so hps I have left.
Didnt even get time to turn and run.
