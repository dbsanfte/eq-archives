I have a PIII 733 and Thunderbird 700 system.  Both have 128MB RAM.  The
Pentium system has a 10K SCSI hard drive and both have Geforce cards.  When
I first got them, I zoned in 20-30 seconds.  Now I zone in 60 secs to 3 min
on both systems.  I have no idea why.  I've defragged and disabled firewall
and antivirus software, and every other non-essential program and it didn't
help.  I reloaded my firewall and antivirus stuff because it made little
difference.  I don't get it.  It started about 4 or 5 main patches ago.
Sometime  after the switch to DX7.
