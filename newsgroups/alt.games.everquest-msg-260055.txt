What you have is very little experience and very little observation.

Making matters worse, your experience and observations were gathered at
a time where conditions aren't likely to exist for long.

Not much unlike measuring how bright sunlight is...during a solar
eclipse.

I can't hardly be expected to know through newsgroup osmosis how much
MMOG experience you have, and how closely related those experiences
are to game the mechanic "ping it, and it's yours" you experienced in
WoW.

Besides, having played MUDs (but they weren't called MUDs at the time)
since 1980 leads me to the arrogant conclusion that my theories are
probably just as valid as yours.

If you have some past experience specifically applicable to the
topic, present it.  Tyas (sp?) did, and his input was extremely
interesting and valuable.  Yours, so far, are just guesses based on
bad science.

It's the most recent applicable experience I could present, and most
likely to be understood by the majority of AGE'ers.  It is by no means
the limit of my experience with online role playing games.

Perhaps I read bizbee's comments incorrectly, but he didn't exactly
seem on your side on the issues.  Not that "appeal to authority" or
"appeal to the masses" is an even slightly valid debating technique
anyway.

After all, EVERYONE used to know the world was flat.

I blame bizbee's influence.

Just kidding, bizbee.

Bob, don't take it personally.  I just argue things like I see them.
It wouldn't surprise me if I came down strongly on your side of some
debate tomorrow.

I'm talking less about the "ping it, and it's yours" game mechanic,
and more about not drawing too many conclusions when the WoW open
public beta was so ridiculously crowded.
