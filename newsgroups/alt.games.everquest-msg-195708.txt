I've heard that before.  That does not, however, have anything at all
to do with the _appearance_ of the artwork, which is what I attempted
to capture in my description (successfully, imo).  The mere fact that
that the character models were created and/or directed by a woman has
nothing at all to do with the impression they create, cheesy soft-
core porn aimed squarely at the mentality of 13 year-old boys does
not magically morph into something else just because a woman drew it.
A pile of manure by any other name smells just as bad.
