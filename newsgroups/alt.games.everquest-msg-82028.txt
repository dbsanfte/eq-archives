Ok.  Check out http://www.primenet.com/~bhance/invent.JPG
(Note: If you're typing this in by hand, the case of the ".JPG" in
important.  Use lowercase and you won't see anything but a 404 error.)

Why yes, I do make a damned sexy ranger.  But that isn't the point of
this.

You'll notice that the I've moved around and resized a couple of the
screens, which isn't a big deal.  The important thing to look at is
that little rectangle right next to your your money that says "AUTO
EQUP AREA".  This works just like your picture did in the old
interface.  Just dump an item there, and if you have an open stack of
it somewhere in your inventory it will be added to that stack.  All
nice and good.
