}I disagree...  The educational system is a valuable tool for children,
}*in their later years*.
}Parents need to take a leading role in their TODDLERS education...
}Note the word, Toddlers...

Aye, one who toddles, or walks like a two-year-old.  Which would suggest 
that TODDLERS are not exactly in the age group that the show in question 
is even targeted for...

And we are in full agrement that parents need to take a leading role in 
the education of their child, regardless of his/her age.  Some parents 
look for tools and resources to assist them in this task.  Sesame street 
could be such a tool.  If you feel that it teaches lessons that you find 
distasteful, or that it doesn't teach those lessons well, you are quite 
free to use a different tool.  No one is forcing your child to watch 
Sesame Street.

So yes, it would be -great- if parents took a leading role, and it's a 
real shame that adding a controversial issue to Sesame Street is going to 
screw up your plans to let the TV educate for you.  Let's just hope the 
schools don't become too cntroversial for you, so you don't have to find a 
substitute for that.  It would be such a pity if you were forced to take 
a leading role, after all.

}>But the fact is, they don't.  The majority don't even express an interest 
}>until we try to teach their precious babies something vaguely 
}>controversial like evolution, or school prayer.
}I don't consider evolution controversial.. 

You do not think that it inspires discussions marked especially by the 
expression of opposing views?  I'm sure those who disagree about whether 
it should be taught or not, or whether creation science should get equal 
time, will be pleased to know that you have resolved their disagreement 
for them.

}>So if something actually needs to get taught, waiting on the parents to do 
}>it may not be the best plan.  If the 'let the parents do it' plan worked, 
}>all these kids would already be informed on these issues and it would 
}>never even come up as an issue, would it?
}Are you proposing kids rasied by the state if the parents are acting
}as the state wishes??

Well, first I'm going to assume you meant 'are not acting', because 
otherwise that just doesn't make any sense.

That happens anyway in serious cases.  Child Protective Services comes and 
takes the cute little bunny away if the parents are abusive.  But that's 
not what I was adressing.

What I -was- adressing is more along the lines of why school attendance 
becomes mandatory.  There are things that children must learn in order to 
survive in our society.  At some point, society feels that it can't all be 
left up to the parents, or it would be infinitey easier to arrange to have 
your child home schooled.  Although it's also telling how few parents 
would actually choose to homeschool if it were a more readily available 
option.  

If parents were, on average, taking an active role in their toddler's 
education on these issues, nobody would ever suggest sex ed for kids, 
since the kidswould arrive atschool already kowing all about it.  But the 
fact is, far too many parents are uncomfortable discussing such things, so 
then there is a need, and someone suggests it.  And then the parents go 
ballistic because they wanted to do that themselves, apparently, even 
though they had plenty of opportunity and didn't.
