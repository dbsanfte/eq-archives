The spell description states:

"Steals hope from your target, decreasing their attack rating, and 
increasing your own for %z"

When casting this on mobs last night, my own ATK rating did not increase. 
Siphon Strength *did* cause my ATK to increase, so I guess STR does play 
into the ATK rating.

Is Despair working as intended, bugged or just tagged with an incorrect 
description? Aside from in the description, I couldn't find anything else 
on Lucy to support the ATK buff for the caster (though admittedly, I have 
trouble making sense of a lot of that data).
