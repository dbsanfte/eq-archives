Final Fantasy has numerous groups, but no specific groups for specific 
versions of the game. (they are things like 'rpg, tech support, 
research, fiction, etc...)

And if you want to post XI (online) questions in several of them, you 
better bring your asbestos jumpsuit. The old 'There hasn't been a decent 
FF since III' crew absolutly loaths the online game. Your questions 
might be answered but the answer will be among 20 or so flames.

One of the reasons why I still hang around here. >o.o<
