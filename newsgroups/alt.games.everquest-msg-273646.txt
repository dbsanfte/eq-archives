That probably does explain the problems the troll had (using troll
in the EQ sense, not the newsgroup sense!); he tried reinvising
using a potion, but you can't do that once you start the trade.
You need someone else to reinvis you.

But your first sentence brings us back to where I started this thread.
I've since confirmed that the new (and probably temporary) quests in
Lavastorm can be done WITHOUT breaking invis.  That is, I go up to the
turn-in NPC while invis, give him something, get the reward, and I'm
still invis!  Not only that, but I'm pretty sure I was able to get the
NPCs to respond to quest dialogs while I was invisible.

I need to find some simple quest I can try to see if this change applies
to old quests as well.  Hm, maybe I'll run some more gems between the
bazaar and Shadowhaven. :-)
