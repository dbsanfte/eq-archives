I improved my shoulders from drolvarg to engraved bone pauldrons for 300
(-20 cha tho, don't forget when using npc vendor) .. just checked the
bazaar, they are all gone so that might have been underpriced.

What about acrylia leggings? Quite a lot of competition on acrylia items
now.

Don't know about the footpads, haven't seen that item?

Otherwise, we are wearing pretty much the same, and i'm lv 47; the exception
being i have those haste handwraps, a spider belt, and just trance
stick/knuckleduster. The imbued fighter's staff looks good, and i'd love to
understand how to woork out the damage per second rules; i have +12 to 2hb
weapon, but i'm not sure how to estimate whether my damage output would be
better with such an item. Certainly, it looks extremely good, according to
monkly business.
