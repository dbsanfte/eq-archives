Color me jealous. I pay over double that for my ISDN. "Thank you for
choosing Bellsouth", they say. As if I have a freaking choice...

Nonetheless, I could never go back to dialup. ISDN's low latency is
great for gaming, and it's rock solid UNLESS there's lightning nearby --
which is all too common this time of year -- but at least I can see
that coming and warn my group that LD is likely.
