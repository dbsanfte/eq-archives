The level is now 46 good sir. I don't envy your upcoming trip through 40 and
45, but I digress. I agree that your mana calculations are correct, I didn't
really check them - I'm taking it for granted. Anyway, the Mana-per-WIS
calculation breaks down once you hit 200 WIS, then WIS only counts for 1,
yes one, mana point per WIS point. Sooooo, as long as you can keep your WIS
at or above 200, trading WIS for mana, or AC/STR/Resist for that matter, is
a good thing. Even a lowly Moonstone ring =).

Todd

P.S. Just for completeness, You should max out WIS for crafting, there WIS
over 200 does help. Or at least the rumor has it.
