Idiot, you have no idea how the FANG (that's Fighter Ace Newsgroup) works,
do you?  Everyone over there is completely aware of all activities that go
on in the newsgroup and the community.  The post you're quoting was written
by someone who doesn't even play the game.  Once again, you've shown your
ass, only to have it handed back to you.

The dropoff is probably attributed to the fact that some people have lives
away from the computer.  LOL   God, you really are a dweeb, aren't you?  It
must be nice to have nothing better in your life to do than sit on your fat
ass and post to a video game newsgroup.  How's that vein in your head, geek?
