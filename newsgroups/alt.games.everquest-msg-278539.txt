Yes, they COULD do that.  If they do, that would be fine.
There's at least one example of a game where they didn't
think of making it possible for selected alts to opt in or
out of it.  My wife plays COH, and she has a lot of toons,
and a lot of online friends.  She turned on the feature to
let friends know when any of her characters log in.  Alas,
in COH it's all or nothing.  This led to some problems
because our daughter has a few characters on the account,
and some of my wife's friends tend to use mature language.
My wife had to send messages to all her friends telling
them not to talk to <list of daughter's characters>, and
tell our daughter what to do if any of <list of people>
started talking to her thinking she was her mother.  That's
a lot of hassle that could have been avoided if they'd just
thought to offer the option of leaving selected alts off
the tracking list.
