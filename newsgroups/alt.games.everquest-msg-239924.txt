No offense, but this either speaks poorly of the warrior class in general 
(in spite of the "click attack and watch TV" jokes, I do expect tanking 
at that level to require more skills than a five-year-old would possess 
to do it as well as you claim) or the grandfather for letting the kid 
play a character of a high enough level in a situation that could 
potentially cause others some real inconvenience. 

There is also the possibility that you are grossly exaggerating the 
facts, but I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt there. ;)
