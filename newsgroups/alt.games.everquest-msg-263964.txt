Oh they do. ;) I just think that it can be avoided once the group learns
the finer details of aggro management. And then you have my above
scenario. :/

I want to clarify a few things though. After reading my post cited above
I realized it's full of spelling mistakes and most probably of grammar
errors too. This isn't only due to the fact that english isn't my native
tongue. The thing that irks me is that I really wanted EQ2 to be a great
game! So I'm a bit bitter about everything is going to work out.
However SoE seems to be willing to listen to their audience and adresses
a lot of these issues with the latest patch. So with a bit luck mobs
will become the challenge they are supposed to be.

I wouldn't call Saga of Ryzom a 4th generation mmorpg but they claim to
have a full collision detection engine. So it should be possible to
shield the weaker groupmembers! I haven't tried it yet but I'm really
thinking about it.
