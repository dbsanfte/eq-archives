    Top end prices are inflated. Always have been, always will be. The
absolute size of these prices will only increase as a server gets older and
more plat comes onto it.

    The increase should have happened back when the new UI was introduced,
not recently. That's when people discovered you could dupe with ease with
the new UI, and churned out stacks and stacks of Blue Diamonds to sell back
to the vendor. That money was never taken away by the GMs, and that's what a
lot of the plat floating around came from. Maybe Yantis has been able to
purchase more plat since he got involved with Monkly Business - more people
found out about him.

    Corrupt GMs? Please. A corrupt GM could do a lot more than just make
plat for resale.
