    Question: would you consider soloing at higher levels, say post-40, to
be good practice for grouping? Many of the top-flight enchanters I've known
have done things like pull half the specs in Oasis and take them all, or
break and hold Frenzy in LGuk at higher levels. Having watched an ENCH solo
those specs, I'm just wondering if dealing with multiples like that when
solo helps prepare an ENCH for the dangerous trains a group can bring in, or
whether the skill sets required for the two tasks are too different.
