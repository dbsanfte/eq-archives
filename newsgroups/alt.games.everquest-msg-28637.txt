Instill Doubt (It's a fear type ability of Rogues, and
Monks, not sure if anyone else gets it or not)

Instill Doubt can be used on any target, be it NPC, PC, or a
PC corpse.  As long as you don't change your target you can
be any distance away from them.  As a Barbarian Rogue, I was
doing a fair bit of mammoth pulling in my 20's and early
30's, when I got ID, I would target a group mate and go
running off to find a mammoth practicing my skill.  It uses
your combat animations and results with a kick as the final
part, if the kick land's successfully, then the mob is
feared and runs off, making for a fear kite type situation.
