I wonder what this is good for,I hate leveling with a passion,didnt
make a level since 1 month after release of OoW,when I took my 
Ranger to 67 to qualify for "Origin" AA.
My 65 cleric with now 100 AAs can heal fine in a mission which 
yields 56 crystals,let me add I did this without Enchanter mana
regeneration buff and the group didnt notice it,in fact I was fm most
of the time.
This is a thing really capable to make me quit,I already lost the
ability to make my own groups,most people dont want "lowbies" :p
in their group,so there is not much point to start one as a 65.

I alrerady had the pleasure in a NC group to meet a 68 cleric with no
AAs or gear(I assume) to speak of,who was screaming oom after every
mob,with my Ranger.

Fortunately for Sony I found some linkminded people,who think that
quality(AA and gear) and fun is more important than quantity
(levels),and am in a "lowbie" "family-style" guild.

Playing the game only relying on pickup groups like I did in some
phases of my EQ career is now impossible,thanks to EQ2 and the
stupid level requirements in Don.
