I know EQ has amassed a huge collection of items, but to see the number of
exploits and read about how much some people accumulated is amazing.  Giant
snake fangs were giving over 1K.  I wish I  hadn't been so tired because I
only managed to get 30 or so running along the desert area in East
Commonlands (fortunately for me I didn't wait until morning and turned them
in immediately).  I tested my Arcane Shield of Living Ice and the value was
17K.  If that remains the same, at least those LDoN drops would be a bit
more meaningful.  The bazaar is flooded with LDoN regular named drops and
everytime I put something on the bazaar mule I have to sell it a bit
cheaper.
