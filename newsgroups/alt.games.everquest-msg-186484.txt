Not ignored ... apparently snipped.

They seem to be doing the first ... I just noticed a whole area of Gigantic
Spiders in Everfrost that are blue - yellow to my lvl 22 wiz.  They seem to
be there to bridge to the gap between the sow orcs and the mammoths.

As for the second, if they made the boat between Butcher and Freeport a
cruise ship with a casino, etc. on it, I suspect folks would spend their
nights there.  I'd certainly give it a try.

I don't think you can make the run from SK to Halas entertaining ... no
matter how hard you try.
