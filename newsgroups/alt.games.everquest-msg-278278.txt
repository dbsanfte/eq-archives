Seriously, I'm sure there is a heck of a lot more that goes into running EQ 
that people here are willing to consider - more than just x-number of 
server boxes and x-GB's of bandwidth (not that one EQ server necessarily = 
one server box).

If it's not worth $14.99/mo. to someone, I get that, I suppose, but I can't 
imagine anyone ever thinking a company might decrease their rates. We were 
due for another minor increase (this one still being smaller than the 
last), and here it is.

Still a bargain, if you ask me. /shrug
