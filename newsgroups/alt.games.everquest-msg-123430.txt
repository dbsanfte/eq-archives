Our guild was gathering today to head to Skyfire to see if we could get 
a shot at Ragefire.
So around 22 people head to Skyfire, and instantly a guy is complaning 
about us KSing him, because he sat there for days. Guy in question got 4 
people in Skyfire, so wouldnt be able to kill Ragefire if it popped on him.
He start shouting about us in OOC and shout. We wont want fight, so 
ignore him, while people form 4 other guilds try to explain to him that 
Ragefire is about getting force there first.
We reach the spawn area and start buffing up, get some more guildies and 
allies there.
Guy keeps on complaining.
Eventually the people in the zone are divided like this:
33 people from our guild or allies
10 people from another guild who wanna make a try at Ragefire just like us.
8 people from origninal morons group.

Ok, the guy just wont give up, so he petition, and a guide show up. Were 
actually happy about that, since Rage isnt a camp, and he dont have the 
force there, so only thing a guide will accomplish are to keep the guy 
from training us.

Guide discuss with him for around 10 min, then wanna talk to us.

Then the guide quote from what she call Verants Rule Book, and according 
to that, youll need to roll on a Ragefire camp.
We roll, and we loose the roll, moron wiht 8 people win.
Guide tells us that the moron now have first right to Ragefire the next 
30 min, we get 2nd shot, not in any way bothering with him not having 
the force, or us being 4 times as many as he is.


First, appearantly from now on, Verant acknowledge camps, according to 
the guides rule book.
2nd, camps are appearantly decided with rolls now, so if you want a camp 
somewhere, just petition and quote the verant rule book that say that 
camps are rolled.
3rd, ragefire is now appearantly an official camp.


Its gonna be really interesting to see what get out of this, since guide 
violate both the PNP and VIs own rules.


Oh, and we have reported the guide to VI, including full logs of the 
incident.
