Hello, Well Im taking my 32 Bard to Velious probably tommorow, will likely
have a 30 Iksar Monk with me and possibly a higher level necro friend to
baby sit us till we get used to the place a bit.
What I'm wondering is when it comes to Giant/Dragon faction over there is a
bard suited more toward gaining with Giants? and fighting Dragons (not that
I will be doing that anytime soon I am sure). I only ask because I have
heard alot about the usefulness of bards against fighting dragons later on,
and don't want to go build it up with the wrong side only to lose it
later....If there is any side an Iksar Necro is suited toward taking I'd
like to hear opinions on that too.
Sorry to make another Giant/Dragon faciton post, I notice there is alot, but
checked all over deja and saw nothing that really was specific enough.
Thanks.
