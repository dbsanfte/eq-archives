From the Plane of Storms, you need to loot a sash, a beard, a head, two
different medallions, and a bone. The heads are common drops around the
zone, the bone a little harder to get but can be found in the desert area,
the medallions must be obtained from two different camps (they look
identical but the three different camps produce three distinct medallions
and you need any two distinct ones) which drop off some of the nameds in the
zone (someone else may chime in here with particulars). The sash and beard
are less common than the head (hmm, did they drop also off the named?), but
I think still fairly common (or at least were for me when I did this quest).

Take all six of these items and follow Askr's directions explicitly and
carefully. He stands over by the tree that you use to exit the zone. Once
you've completed his dialogs, run to the big tornado in the middle of the
zone, invis up and run past the froggies near the storm and run right into
it. This will zone you into BoT with your key. As this is a necessary part
of the planar progression to get elemental access, you'll find lots of
people doing this quest and you should be able to get lots of help on it.

I did the entire quest with a small raiding party that I led in one
afternoon. We had like 2 groups of 65s and it was overkill but fun and
rewarding.

By the way, if you haven't already, open up a premium account on Allakhazam
and there you will find tons of information just like this on quests, items,
and annotated comments from users. Well worth the nominal cost, one of the
best resources on the net, along with this newsgroup of course. ;-)
