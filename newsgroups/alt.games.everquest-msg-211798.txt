In that case, Jenn... thank you.  /bow

One of our concepts is instead of having a ten-page book of rules to govern
our behavior, we will all agree to follow certain norms of behavior, which
we call Tenets.  The Tenets are open to individual interpretation, subject
to your own conscience.  If we find someone consistently taking advantage of
others because of the 'loose' nature of the Tenets, then they're probably
not a good fit and asked to leave.  In case anyone's interested, these are
our Tenets.  This is the first draft, still open to development / change.
We'll never be an uberguild - we're looking at a max membership of 18 to
24 - but the point is to have fun, ils ne pas?  The Devs say any pre-PoP
encounter should be doable with 24 with a few exceptions (the Emp comes to
mind) so that's what we're shooting for.

=========The Tenets============


Friendship
The members of AR are our friends. Friends take each other's feelings into
account. Whether we are teasing, chatting, discussing, disagreeing, or
arguing, we do so as friends - with respect for each other's feelings and
remembering that when the conversation is over we will still be friends.
Similarly, when we take an action that will affect a guildmember, we try to
think how that action will make our friend feel.

Honor
Members of AR will act in honor at all tlmes. While we do not expect all
players to act honorably, our self-respect will not allow us to respond to a
dishonorable act dishonorably. Look into your heart; if you would object to
someone doing it to you then don't do it to others.

Courtesy
Whether dealing in-guild or out, courtesy is expected of the membership of
AR. Polite behavior is a sign of strength; only the weak need to bring
someone else down. Mature behavior enhances both your reputation and that of
your guild.

Cooperation
The goal of AR is to help each other reach our goals. Members of AR are
expected to reach out and help each other. You have every reason to expect
your guildmates' help - and they have every reason to expect yours.

Freedom
Members of AR have the freedom to enjoy Everquest. We reconize that everyone
participates at the level they are able and beyond a wholesome desire for
the company of friends, we will not pressure any member beyond that point.
We do expect that our members have joined for the purpose of advancing along
with the guild and have similar goals.
