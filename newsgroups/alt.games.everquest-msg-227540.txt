I do prefer NBG for precisely some of the reasons that others have
stated.  That said, I will go along with whatever loot rules are
decided by the group as a whole.

Nowadays, and I don't konw why this is, I find myself winding up in
so-called pickup groups with people that I've grouped with before
(sometimes it's just shear luck, sometimes it's because they
recognized my name with other clerics who were LFG.  Most of the time,
I never find out.  My feeling is that if you treat people well (by not
competing with them for items that they really need) that they will
treat you well.  You might well THINK that these are total strangers
who you'll never  meet again.  The truth is that, especially with
LDoN, you will see most of them time and time again.  You get to know
who the people are who are fun to group with, and those who are
particularly good or poor players. And the fact is that there really
IS bad feelings when one or two people in a group want NBG, but are
voted down, and they end up losing out on some choice item that they
really want (the Ornate molds that someone else mentioned come to
mind, but there are others). 

Some people are also pretty much clueless as to how much things are
worth.  Back in the days when Vellious was fairly new, I was grouped
in GD killing giants.  They hadn't set any loot rules because "nothing
ever drops there"  Sure enouigh,  Improved ITU dropped, and I was the
only one in the group who could use it.  I asked if I could get it
because of this, and I was told, point blank, that NBG is only for
guild groups, and that spells could sell for over 1k (back when the
most money I'd ever had in my bank account was about 500plat).  Now
I'm thinking, first of all, that there is NO WAY that that spell is
worth much more than a hundred pp, and even if it was, I wouldn't pay
more than 50 for it.  It wasn't like I was using the normal ITU spell
all that much and felt I could live withotu the improved version.
That said, I felt like the people in that group were being real petty,
and I quite the group over it.  Call me petty also, but these were not
the types of peopel that I'd ever want to group witth.
