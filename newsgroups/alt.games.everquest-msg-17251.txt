I noticed that too at the lake at that lvl.
I posted here thinkin my 'con' system had gone wrong lol!
It seems to me rangers are wimpy depending on their lvl, once I hit 26
everything was ok again.  But It started again at 34, I stayed crap again
till 39...then I started killing stuff np again.   BTW I have had the same
armour from lvl 20, so it wasn't that, sigh.
Have definately noticed that some blue stuff will still kick the hell outta
me, and other blue cons will barely give me exp and almost die afore I hit
em more than a few times lol!
I just attack everything once in a new area, (with a blue con that is) until
I find something that suits.

Happy huntin

Oakas
