I bought a GGS and now my JC shows up as 215, I think its 205 naturally. The
GGS adds 5%.  My question is can I do combine that triv at 210 lets say and
still get skill ups, or does the GSS somehow screw that up? I did lots the
other day and no skill ups, then it dawned on me that the GGS may be
precluding skill points, but then again it doesn;t say "you can no longer
advance.."
