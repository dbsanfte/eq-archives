My children are also forced to go to said school, and adopt a secular
attitude while there.  That is a blatant disregard for the first ammendment.
Why does your children's right not to see offensive religious practices
trump my children's right to observe their faith?  What of the muslim
children who must pray at regular times?  Are they required to hold their
prayers until the end of the school day?

Or, to take another look, why is it that my child can be indoctrinated into
radical environmentalism, feminism, reverse-racism, anti-Americansim, while
they can't practice their faith?  Why is it that it's OK for a christian
student to see to guys holding hands, but it's not alright for a
non-christian child to hear a prayer?  All of these things happen in a place
where my child is forced to attend.
