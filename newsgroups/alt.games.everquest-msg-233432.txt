Don't sweat it too much -- start looking for and joining LDON groups and
just be frank with the groupleader that you're new to it. People will fill
you in on what's different about it. It's not rocket science after all, and
you've taken a character to lvl56 so people shouldn't act like you're a
clumsy newbie.

There are no printable maps to LDoN dungeons but the cartographic tool works
well for it. You should download all the map files at www.eq-toolbox.com and
then start using the in-game tool.

I see few LDoN groups as low as the low 20s, better that you level the
beastlord up to around 30 or even 40 (which is quite easy to do solo, from
my own experience) first. Then start taking him into LDoN and he'll do well
there.
