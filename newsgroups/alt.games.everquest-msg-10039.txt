Well, I picked a server finally (Erollisi Marr) and started my Human
Warrior.  Things were going along just PEACHY and the lack of nightsight is
NO PROBLEM at all.  So I am marching along beautifully on my way to level
4... received a nice 2HS sword that does 17dmg and some Rawhide armor from
nice, caring strangers and am enjoying everything.  I amass a mound of
bonechips and make the stupidest decision of my EQ life.

I decided to take the boat to Butcherblock to turn in Bone chips at Kaladim
for some nice exp since I have a lot!  As soon as I get off the boat, I am
killed by an Aqua Goblin Wizard in 3 seconds!  Bam, sucks!  I get pissy and
make it back before my corpse decays by taking another 10 hour boat ride
from Freeport.  I am happy once more and say "Whew, things are back on
track."  So I march my butt into Kaladim and am instantly killed by the
guards at the entrance!  I spawn again in WFreeport and take yet another 10
hour boat ride to try and get someone to summon my corpse or cast invis on
me but this time I am killed by the guards right outside of the docks!

Ah!  Finally I give up and leave all my possessions, donated weapon and
armor and all the pp I amassed behind since my corpse no doubt will decay
any minute now.  My question is why is a HUMAN WARRIOR that worships Rallos
Zek (or whomever the bottom deity is that is the deity of war I believe) KOS
all over Butcherblock?  This made for a miserable morning.
