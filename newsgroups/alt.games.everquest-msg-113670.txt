Not meaning to start a completely different rant, but is that because they
got the idea from Wal-mart?
MANY times have I purchased things from Wal-fart only to find that they have
been opened, either damaged or defect, returned, resealed, and reshelved. I
had to buy some RCA cables about 3 weeks ago, and the ONLY ones they had
were opened and taped back shut (and they had at least 5+ packages too).  I
didn't mind as that was something less likely to have a problem (more likely
someone needed them for a one time use and returned them...how can you come
up with an excuse to return cables in a clear package with pictures and
instructions on the back?).
When trying to get some shoes, I spent nearly 30 minutes trying to find a
pair that didn't have a defect of some kind.
    DirecTV had last year started a "Card out of box" program where certain
retailers would get equipment that came without an access card and the
purchaser would have to call DTV to get a card mailed to them.  They called
it "card out of box" program and said it was to prevent employee or customer
theft, more like a "we caught you steeling from us so we'll just quit giving
them to you" program.
    Now if you buy DTV equipment from Wal-mart they (do now or VERY soon
plan to) give you a certificate that proves you purchased it, then you call
and give that number to DTV who will ship you equipment.  I am assuming this
is due to the HUGE number of defective electronics coming from Wal-mart and
a few other retailers.  I once dealt with someone who was about to return
his equipment for exchange for the 3rd time for being defective.
