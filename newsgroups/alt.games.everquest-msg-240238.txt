No. not quite.

If you checked the movie out of the library, and then found people
willing to pay to see your checkout receipt would that also be
copyright infringement by definition?

Of course not.

The profit *must* stem from violation of those specific rights
protected under copyright... these include: copying (of course),
broadcasting, public performance, rental... etc

There simply isn't a clause that *reasonably or obviously* covers
moving in game items between paying subscribers. It is possible a
judge would rule in DT's favour... but its not a given, and its not
remotely even a liklihood.

Actually that again isn't sufficient for copyright violation. If I
throw a movies and beer night, and everyone is expected to chip in 10
bucks to cover the cost of renting the movies and buying the beer...
no copyright violation has occurred...

Unless the general public can come, instead of just my friends... but
then its a public performance... which *is* specifically protected.

Again, I don't see the location of the property being relevant. And in
fact weakens the copyright... because the specific data being
transacted is 'my character record', the content of which to an extent
is my creation. I can assert some copyright of my own there... just as
emails written at www.hotmail.com are the creative works and property
of the authors... not Microsoft, despite it being data on their
servers in their applications...

That much we agree on.
