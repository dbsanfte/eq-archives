Well, even with Titanium, plan on a very lengthy patch download, as much of 
that content has been patched since its release.

As far as websites go, http://www.monkly-business.net (has since seperated 
form the .com counterpart which is part of the nefarious OGaming network, 
as I understand it) and http://www.thesafehouse.org are still active 
resources.

Are you planning on giving the progression server(s) a shot, or going back 
to the one you played on before?
