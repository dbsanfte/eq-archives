    My apologies, but Summon Corpse as you point out IS a level 39 spell. It
isn't too tough to get a "guild necro" to 39 for the sole purpose of corpse
summoning, even for a younger guild. They do solo pretty well, after all. 8)

    They may be listed at that, but I've seen ONE raid go in there at that
level and they had babysitters. And they sure didn't have folks below 35.

>Plus believe it or

    Like I said - go make one. Have the person with the most free time in
the guild, or the person who most wants to do it, level them up. Or, go out
there and find one that's an agreeable chap and guild them. The hardest part
will actually be getting Summon Corpse, since a guild at that level would
either have to buy it or raid Paw for it.

>Sorry to burst your little bubble of uberness,

    Now level 39 is uber? Damn, imagine how mind-bendingly uber those level
53s are!
