The mob gets a check to break root every tick, starting as soon as root
lands.

It wasn't meant to be a crack.  At higher levels, mobs are hitting for a
lot.  Casters *will* get aggro, and get hit one or two times before someone
can get the mob back under control.  Clerics in hard areas or in raids have
a lot to keep track of.  When things go bad, it is often the Cleric's
actions that determine whether there is a total wipe out, or a harrowing but
fun narrow escape.  So, if you are judging normal Cleric play just from XP
grouping, I think it is a good idea to investigate higher level situations,
where those things that annoy you in XP groups may turn out to be normal
occurances.

Cleric is one of those classes whose play undergoes important changes at
various level ranges, and if one of those changes turns it into a class that
doesn't fit in with what you find fun, it can be a bad class to play.

Compare to Wizards.  We Wizards have one big change at level 29, when we get
a snare spell, and so can switch when soloing from root/nuke to kiting.  A
little later, when we start to get some good AoE nukes, we *add* the option
of multikiting, but it is just an option.  For the most part after that, the
changes in Wizards as they level up are that they get spells that work
better--those don't change *what* we do, it just changes whether or not it
works. :-)  (I'm counting manaburn as adding another option, rather than
changing how the class is played).
