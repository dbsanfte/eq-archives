Addressing various points without quoting them:

Yes, druids get Tracking at 20.  I'm amazed a druid 24 didn't have it.
(I was salivating over it in anticipation as early as 17, and when I
hit 20 I gated somewhere with a druid guild so I could learn it asap.)

I agree that the mammoths are a good cash crop for that level.  My monk
hunted there until they turned green, and my druid is hunting them now.
(With track and SOW.  Actually, I tried it without SOW at first because
I had gotten a one-shot horse and wanted to see if the mana regen made
up for the lack of SOW.  More on that in another thread.)

I don't mess with the Tainted yet since I'm not ready to take on the
Corrupt.  But it's clear that other mobs can sometimes fill up the
mammoth "slots".  Last night, there were generally just two mammoths
up on Track, one of them being the Tainted.  As soon as I (or the other
person hunting) killed the untainted one, a new one would appear at the
top of the track list -- but not quite always.  Sometimes some other mob
would appear instead.  So I'd just track whatever it was and kill it,
but usually by the time I'd done that there was already another mammoth
up, presumably because someone else had killed some other mob.

So in general, I think the most efficient way to hunt them would be to
get a tracker, and if they say there's no mammoths up, kill trash mobs
for a while and then check again.

Also, an old web site (no longer available except via www.archive.org)
that gave old-world mob spawn points (derived, I think, via showEQ)
showed the mammoths spawning at various points along the eastern area,
extending all the way to the south edge.  Seems unlikely to me, since
usually the newly spawned mammoths started out fairly close to camp.
