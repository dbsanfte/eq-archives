The compare a P3-700 against a P3-1ghz.

There is a significant linear progression. 

Going from a GF2MX card to a GF4Ti4200 is a huge improvement overall.
You will be able to run FSAA (full-screen anti-aliasing) and higher
levels of Anisotropic filitering and still be able to run at
acceptable peformance levels. This translates into much better image
quality.
