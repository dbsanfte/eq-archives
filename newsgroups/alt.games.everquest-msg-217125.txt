Since the vendors will show you items that are a bit over the points
you've earned in any one camp, do you need enough points to just see
the item on a vendor in order to buy? 

IE: I've earned 500 points in Butcherblock but I can see items worth
700. Can I buy that item? (numbers are purely fictional)

... not that it matters at this point, I haven't broken the top 2000
on the Bristlebane leader board <g>.
