I like to get a bow and arrows that have range, just so i don't get close.
But if your just pulling, damage isn't that important.

the only time I really use the flash of light spells is when soloing and I
get two on me.  I flash one and back up, he runs away blind and keep hitting
the other one.  When he comes back I do it again, back up and he runs away
blind.  Pally Flash kitting I guess.)  It also helps if you need to heal
yourself.  Flash the mob back up they run, heal yourself.
