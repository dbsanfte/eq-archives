That's one way.  Better yet, all Paladins, SKs, Necros, and Clerics DA and 
jump in, bards DA their group, group jumps in.  Anyone left over jumps in, 
and if they do die, not guaranteed they will, but likely, they get rezzed.  
Any clerics with Bestow DA can also DA one additional person.  Also, there 
are some items with DA that people can use, although, it seems pointless, 
xp loss after a 96% rez is minimal.
