I have no doubt that you are correct.  I just get tired of people
regurgitating the pathetic excuse for a rationalization given in-game.
A better way to have done the "cultural" armor would be to have
quest(s) that must be completed to learn the recipes, and once you
have one set of recipes learned all others become unlearnable, ala
existing specialization and tradeskill skill-up limits.  Once you
had earned a point in "Teir'Dal Adamantite Smithing", for instance,
that would be your one and only "cultural" specialization.  If you
do it that way it actually can be made cultural instead of racial.
A little thought put into race/diety restrictions for completing
the quests (i.e. no Paladins or High Elves doing DE stuff, etc.)
would allow you to build a system that reinforces the backstory
instead of one that mocks it.

I'll tell you what ought to unify the Half Elves:  total disdain for
the putrid backstory and its many apologists who simply vomit forth
the bullshit they've been fed without ever a moment's thought as to
how poorly it holds together at the seams.
