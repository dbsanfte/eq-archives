For whatever it's worth, my girls have large sewing kits as well. Yes, they
hold things when you aren't using them, and they're useful in tailoring when
you do use them. I've never made thread. I've always made swatches for
making silk armor, so I can't speak to that. If you want a tailoring site,
the best on the web is Lokari's.

good luck and good hunting...
