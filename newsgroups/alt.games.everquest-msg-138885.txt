Night vision..  a pain but easily overcome.  tranix crown is a very popular
head item for *any* monk, and fixes this.  Even Sow has IV/UV in it now too
(soe) in addition to wolf form

Swimming started at 100 for them... big deal though?   We all still cap at
200

Forage.. not even relevant really

What lizards do have is extra regen, and an AC bonus because they can't wear
certain types of armour

The regen (2hp a tick?) is hardly a major advantage though

Whats your ac at DK?  I hit 1300+ on raids and Im very far from being
"finished" in terms of gear upgrades,  and 1200-1300 is the numbers I've
heard banded about for monks AC soft-cap
