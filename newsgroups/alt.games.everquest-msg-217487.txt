Well sure, the second druid wasn't going to be needed for much
healing either, he's there as "backup" healer.  Then again, you
could also serve as lone healer with either someone else as
backup or Brell, just wing it.  There are situations which demand
clerical healing, LDoN doesn't seem to be one of them.

I was just saying that since you -are- a backup healer class,
there wouldn't be any call for two druids in your groups versus a
single cleric; druid with shaman backup would be more than
adequate as a substitute for a cleric.
