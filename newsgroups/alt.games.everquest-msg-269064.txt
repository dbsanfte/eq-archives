- Swing and a miss. See my post a few back as to the low lev vs high level
patron debate. Low levels become High Levels within a week. Then what?

- You have an amazing skill for pointing out the obvious, but beyond that
your missing the point.  We all know we can turn the computer off and walk
away, nobody is making us do anything, etc etc etc, ya ya ya, we get that...

- But... thats not what we're discussing.... we are talking about levelling
up a guild.... And if you want to level up a guild sony does "REQUIRE" this
kind of play.... So which is stupider? Them requiring it? Or us playing
within their system?  The chicken or the egg?
