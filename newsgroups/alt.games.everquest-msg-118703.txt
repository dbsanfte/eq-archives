Hehe. You should have told that person the difference between beige
and white. (Speaking of which, I never bought allure of the wild.
Maybe I should, for dressup purposes... it'd be a nice contrast to
form of the howler.)

Oh, and last night, a level 4 pally hailed my entirely plate-covered
18 wood elf warrior and asked for buff plz. 
/em pulls a soft cloth out of her backpack and buffs %t's sword till
it shines. >:)
(Would have put armor instead of sword, but he wasn't wearing any.
Also gave him a vital piece of information about how difficult it is
for warriors to buff when their spell gems are always missing)
