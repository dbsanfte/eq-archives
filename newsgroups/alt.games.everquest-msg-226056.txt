Uh... no.

In general, your level of gear is more important than how many AA points
you've used.   I can think of a few exceptions, but not many.

It's easier to get AA's than it is to get gear though, so the two usually go
together.   If you've been around long enough to become well equipped,
you've likely gotten many AA's while you were waiting.
