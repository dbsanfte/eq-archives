Sadly, to the best of my knowledge, there is no Brell specific quest
like the Initiate symbol. 

However, http://www.eqtraders.com is discovering recipes for clay idols
hat can be imbued for each god. Brell's adds stats for STR and STA,
which isn't very useful for a cleric, but it can prove your devotion to
Brell.
