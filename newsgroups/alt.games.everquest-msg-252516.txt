I'll have to look into this, particularly as one objection, the added 10 
minutes travel time per day's hunting, has been cut in half by the 
addition of a Gunthak POK stone.  (the howling of the mob may now begin)

I had a great time in Gunthak in my 30s and 40s, and in Dulak in my 50s, 
both grouped and solo; and I do recall making steady if not stupendous 
cash at the same time.

Splendid
