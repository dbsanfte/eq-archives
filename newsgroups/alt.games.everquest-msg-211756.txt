True, but in an overnight incubation I can grow enough E.coli on a single
blood agar plate from a single CFU (colony forming unit) that, were they
people, would populate the world a few times over.  The timescales are
inversely proportional to the complexity of the organism in question ... the
less complex the organism, the faster time seems to move in relation to that
organism's life cycle.  That's the reason so much research is done on simple
organisms ... easier to get grant money when you can generate successive
generations in a week's time.

Anyway, with selective culturing I can mutate an organism from being
sensitive to an antibiotic to resistant to that same antibiotic in a few
days (not in every case, of course ... some bugs like Group A strep are 100%
sensitive to penicillin as a definiton of their species).

<aside>
By the way, you can, too ... using your body as an incubator.  That's why
you should always take the full course of treatment of any antibiotics
prescribed to you ... if you don't, you'll kill of the sensitive bugs and
create an environment where the more hearty critters survive.  Then they're
harder to take out next time you get sick.
</aside>

But I can't change the species of the bug itself, no matter how hard I try.
