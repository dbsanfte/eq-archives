Okay... one more time for the 'Hard of Thinking' brigade...

http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/sovereign/Forum3/HTML/000292.html

This is the closest I can now get to the original article that appeared on
Lum The Mad's website.
HE is the one that attributes the quote to Flock, claiming it came from an
interview published in The Edge (UK Edition).

Lum The Mad gave the following link...
http://www.edge-online.co.uk/news_main.asp?news_id=3596 as his source.

As you can see... no such quote exists on this webpage. The ACTUAL interview
published in the magazine (which I HAVE read... I live in UK) runs to 3
pages (inc pictures) and THAT doesn't contain any such quote, either!

Conclusion... Lum the Mad published an article in which he CLAIMED to be
quoting Flock... That website CLOSED the same or next day (apparently for
unrelated reasons). People are now 'quoting' something that has NO
attribution to Kelly Flock... but that doesn't matter to those people,
because THEY want something on which they can hang their own twisted
world-view.

You want to believe it's true, because you want to believe... despite the
evidence or lack of it.
