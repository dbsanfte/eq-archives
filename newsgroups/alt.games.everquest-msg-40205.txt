Nope, all mobs of a certain level give the same exp.  Of course not
all mobs of a certain level have the same HPs, skills, weapons,
spells, loot, coin, etc.  The exp for a given mob is basically
(moblevel)(moblevel)(zonemodifier).  The exp needed to gain a level is
basically (yourlevel)(yourlevel)(yourlevel)(levelmodifier).  In other
words exp is a funtion of mob level squared, while the experience
required to increase your level is a function of your level cubed.
