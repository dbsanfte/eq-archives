It's obvious that you're a guide.  All this 'my friend who is a guide 
this' and 'my friend who is a guide that' probably cover you with Verant, 
and I'm glad you're taking the time to be a guide.  However, either you're 
being purposefully obtuse, or you are a very good example of what is wrong 
with the guide program:  Guides who don't know enough about the game and 
guide/GM abilities to be consistant, fair, and unbiased.  I'm not saying 
that you're incompetant or that you're an idiot, just that you appear to 
be lacking certain knowledge that I would consider vital for you to do you 
(volunteer) job.
