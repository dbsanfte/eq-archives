Actually dont bother putting any points in Tailoring, instead buy yourself a
small tailoring kit and start combining two spider silks into it, they never
fail and trivial out at 15, all my charactors did this with out wasting a
single training point.  Plus the silk swatches you make stack wereas the
spider silks do not, and thanks to the the new Wu's armor the swatches sell
from anywhere from 1 to 10 pp each, although I think 1 to 2 pp per is fair.
