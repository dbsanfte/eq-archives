I do epic raids/fights, and will group with personal friends and 
guildies to get specific items, but I will NOT go on any open 
raid because I stand the chance of dying, with pretty much no 
benefit to myself whatsoever. I cant make 1% of an aa or regular 
xp, I can't roll, or I am rolling against everybody in the raid 
for some piece of loot that probably isnt an upgrade to me or 
stand sod all chance of actually winning so there is absolutely 
no reason for me to join the raid. I am not flagged for anything, 
and probably never will be from the standpoint of my guild is a 
family guild and will probably never raid anything in its life. 
They cant even field enough people to get the king in chardok or 
ragefire. I will probably never get my epic either, as 
mysteriously all the people that I have helped get epiced seem to 
always be off raiding the planes and never have time to help me 
get mine. =\
