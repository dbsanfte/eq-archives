This would only lead to people whinining about how someone pulled all the 
mobs in an area and then logged or went into a door mish and now noone will 
get exp for killing of these mobs except for the guy doing the door mission. 
But you couldnt not kill the mobs to punish him because then no new mobs 
would spawn.
