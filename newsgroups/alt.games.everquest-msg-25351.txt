hehe that's a great idea. To stop beggars for sow and teleports on
my druid I used to used to used a Parrying dagger which is equippable
by druids in my off hand and a Forged Bastard sword in my main hand
and I looked like a rogue or warrior dual wielding. =)

You could do the Testament of vaneer quest to get that. Easy
quest to do. It is an all/all item:

I can't think of any other thing a HEF rogue could use that would look like
a book. But you could try using a small chunk of Velium that can
can be used by all classes and is a foraged item in Velious. It only
adds +5 hp but it looks like a strange red glove, you will have people
inspecting you to see what it is.
