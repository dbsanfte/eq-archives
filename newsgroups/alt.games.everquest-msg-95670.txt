Only train one point in melee skills.  Always use the most recently acquired
skill e.g. ROUND KICK over KICK etc.  Save your skill points for FEIGN
DEATH.  If you plan on soloing, save some of your skill points for INSTILL
DOUBT (fear).  Others will say that ID is a waste.  I solo 100% of the time
and my ID skill is over 100.  I can usually get off one or two ID's during a
fight.

You need a lego bracer from Crushbone.  I don't believe I've ever seen one
drop in WC.
