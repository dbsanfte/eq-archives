I think the "point" is that as long as you're the only guild able to
hunt successfully in ST, you can keep farming the primal until your
entire guild is outfitted with the best possible gear in the game. (Ok,
there's other hot stuff in ToV, etc. apparently, but from all I've read,
the primal is still damn fine.) Then, when some other uppity high level
guild finally gets enough folks with keys where they could start farming
it, you wake the sleeper and shut down production. This way, you can
ensure that *your* uberguild is the only one with the gear, giving you a
leg up over the rest in the hunt for the other top end stuff.

But I'm just guessing here. I'm far from uber and will likely never see
the inside of ST.
