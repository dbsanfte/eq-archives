You meant druid paradise I am sure.

There are exceptions to the 50+ for summoning.  Often, permarooted mobs 
will summon, regardless of their level.  Many 50+ mobs do not summon.  As 
to how to avoid being summoned, don't damage the mob that summons.  If the 
mob is undamaged, generally, it won't summon.
