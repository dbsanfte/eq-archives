Sometime, when editing a command I have typed in a bash prompt, I find 
myself hitting Shift-LftArrow... and then wondering why it is not working.

To make matters worse I tried to scroll in SecureCRT today using Shift-
PGUP.

Oh well. Last night my Druid got his second Forest Loop and my Chanter 
dinged 14. I guess I can't complain, even though my chanter dinged 14 3 
times last night :-|
