You know, I would /bonk you for making that generalization... but
somehow I have to agree with you. For some odd reason barbarion
warriors (male ones) seem to generally be among the youngest, most
idiotic players I ever run into. Not barb shamans or barb rogues, just
barb warriors.

I'm sure everyone has a combo that they never seem to find good
examples of (besides halfling druids who apply to everyone), for me
its barbarian warriors.

That's some extreme roleplaying maybe.
