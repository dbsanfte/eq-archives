Yes, it happens all the time.  A EULA means what the *courts*
say it means, and can limit what *courts* say they can limit.
It's VERY common for businesses to put items in contracts
which won't be enforced by a court -- or that are blatently
illegal, in fact.

court for litigation all the time, right?  Even against major
corporations?   Check out some of Microsoft's EULA issues...
