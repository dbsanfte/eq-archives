  Powerleveling someone for real life cash isn't against the EULA?  I have to admit,
I haven't read the thing, nor do I intend to (I save my glazed over expression for
doing mindless faction slaughtering).  But really, this doesn't seem to be in the
spirit of what Verant would be hunky-dory with.  I bet that if they had hard evidence
that someone was doing it, they would end up getting warned or banned under the "Just
because we can, turkey" clause that they reserve the right to.
