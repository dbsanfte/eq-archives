One word "FARM"

Farm Hill Giants, or any other greenie safe mobs till the cows come
home cause one day its gonna poof on ya. Wounldnt sell or transfer
anything except the plat/loot you earned that day, should be able to
do 2kp a day easy. If the toon dies get a rez. That way no one can say
you were dishonest and you would learn the char safely. Who knows
maybe you will get to keep it. Be very nice to have around. 
Be sure to /log your petions just in case.


Some people have all the luck )
