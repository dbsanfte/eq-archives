We did 1 Kael Arena fun raid ,maybe 1 or 2 more should give enough
Dragon faction to pass the drakes at entrance hall.
Do you know any details about pulling in east ToV,is it the area
called Halls of Testing?
We have no high level monk or bard for pulling,maybe a 68 Necro can
do the job ?

Hm,we have 70,65,57 Cleric and a 65 Shammy for slows and debuffs,
65 War or 67 pally fortanking.
Will test vindi next time we do Arena,hopefully all have DoN for
corpse summoning.  =)

investigate.
