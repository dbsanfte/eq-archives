HI All;

Doing my epic, I'm at the point of going to Sol-A to kill Lord Grimblox to
get his ring. I've never been to this zone so I don't know it.  In reading
all the walk thru's it sounds like it could be a long camp.  In reading
these walk-thru's it sounds like the room and all surrounding area is filled
with mobs and no one mentioned a safe place to camp.

My Question:  Is there a safe place somewhere close I can bind and/or camp
so I can gate/log back in to check to see if he is up? OR is this really a
place I have to sit for hours keeping the room clear? I don't have the RL
time to sit for hours at a time. When doing Lord Bergurgle, I camped on the
island over his head and just swam to him. One morning I logged in before
work,  he was there and I got him.

Thank you all in advance for your time and suggestions.
