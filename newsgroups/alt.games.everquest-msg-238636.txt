There's a lot of great information at the URL referenced above,
particularly in the sticky FAQ post in the General forum.

This one is also very good: http://membres.lycos.fr/niphreedil/aa.htm

Run Speed >>> all other General AA (no-brainer here).
Spell Casting Mastery >>> all other Archetype AA.
Divine Arbitration -- get it, learn it, love it. 

How you want to fill in the rest has a lot to do with your play style...
how often do you raid vs grind exp, and so forth.
