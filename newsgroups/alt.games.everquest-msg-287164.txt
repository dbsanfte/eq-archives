I get that you're just playing devil's advocate here, Lance (I think),
but it seems to me that the people most likely to be put off by the
spam are those who wouldn't be interested in buying plat in the first
place

Don't get me wrong, I would love a sting operation like this whereby
those who visit the advertised sites and try to make a purchase get
banned, but I just don't see SoE as being either that insightful or
interested in the matter.
