I created a high elf fighter to be a paladin but the instruction book
recommends that high elves become priests or mages. In Eq 1, Paladins
had wisdom based mana however there is no mana in Eq 2, basically I
want to know how flawed my charcater is and is there any advantage at
all to having a high elf fighter?
