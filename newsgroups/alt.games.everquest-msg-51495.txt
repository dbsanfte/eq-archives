This has been a beddy beddy goot weekend.

I made 19, then 20 killing Broon in EK.

Got some great nukes and port and track! TRACK!!!!!

I then went to HH to camp dylin. Noone was there.  I camp for a while and a
20 druid and 28 ranger show up and sit in front of me.  I say I'm camping
dylin. They ignore me.  My wife the 21 Enchatress comes to join me.  The
druid and ranger stand up, look at each other for a few minutes and then
leave.  They could out nuke me but not the 2 of us.  That was right away.

1 hour into it, a 35 druid shows up, asks if I'm camping Dylin. Yes I am.
How long am I going to be there?  Til he spawns, duh!  He leaves.  Comes
back in 15 minutes and says if he's really on a 6 hour spawn he would
already have spawned because he was there the last time dylin was killed and
that was 6 hour 15 minutes ago.  And yer point is?  He leaves.

At 1 hour and 20 minutes, a 17 druid and a 19 paladin show up and setup
camp.  The pally runs around in circles and occassionally inspects me.
Neither said anything to me so I said nothing to them.  My wife and I can
REALLY out nuke these guys.  They hang around for a few minutes and then
leave.

At 1 hour and 40 minutes, dylin pops.  We nuke mercilessly and get attacked
by 3 smugglers.  Dylin drops, I get the page and tell my wife to gate.  I'm
willing to die for a TOV.  I snare around, they whack on me, she gates, I
jump off the cliff (expecting to die) and run into the hhk zone by the
guards.  I make it with about 1/3 bub of health left.

No deaths, new TOV and my wis is now 137.

On Saturday, I helped my wife get her Stein Of Moggok.  My helping was
mainly moral and SOW.  Her int is like 142 now.

This has been a beddy beddy goot weekend.
