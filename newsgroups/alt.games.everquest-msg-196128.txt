Hey Lance,

It was funny to read your post having spent last weekend at the same
camp on the same server with similar impression on a low-level game.

Just a week ago I decided to dust off my first ever char, an erudite
wizard, and have some fun with her. I went to pick some focus items
for her on the bazaar - mana save, damage, spell haste, etc., donated
for KEI and descended upon Paludal caves.

What a change for this (formerly) poor wizard!(I note that I last
played her about 2 years ago) Hehe, I remember how she'd sit on her
ass starring in the damn book for 90% of the time, which was basicaly
the reason why I got borred with her in first place. Now she'd solo
kill blue mobs pretty much non-stop, dropping them like flies in 2-3
nukes with little to no risk, flying through levels.

I got bored at soloing pretty fast and begged to join B1 group, this
is a muly-player game after all, right? That was some fun grouping. I
think the twinked and overbuffed wizard provided about 50-70% of
sustained DPS of the full group. Tag-boom-boom-dead,
tag-boom-boom-dead, almost no down time. When camp get cleared, I
would run to the side and SOLO that red-con named chick by the lake. I
think she is about 5 lvls above me hehe. Often I'd draw aggro and get
hit with little consequences to my dear life - how much damage a sily
mob can do in 5 sec it left to live?

I know pretty well it's not the way the game is intended to be played,
but I did my share of the hard work with my main, and I just like this
option to relax and have a different kind of fun once in a while.

BTW look me up next time you're around the Paludal, the char I play
there now is named Dolgopa, or shoot a tell to Danka, my char I play
the most.

Dolgopa/Danka/etc, MT
