When Desert Storm was pending, there was a story in the papers about a
guy who deserted from an Aussie naval ship heading in that direction
because (he said) he didn't want to kill people.

I sincerely hope I'm not the only one who thinks they guy was an idiot.
When you join the *armed* forces, it seems likely that killing people
will enter the picture at some point. Even if the advertising compaigns
("Be all you can be!") never mention it.

Personally while I'm not sure I agree with the politics of what is shaping
up to be the invasion of Iraq, I think the poor sods on the front line
deserve our support. They certainly don't deserve flak because their
political masters are otherwise motivated.
