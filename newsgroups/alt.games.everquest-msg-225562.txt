>> staff of suffering parts

This reminded me of an uncomfortable 10 days of my life when I won the "NSU"
lottery. If the Non-Specific Urethritis was not uncomfortable enough in
itself I was in the military at the time and the doctor was extremely
unsympathetic. I think he gave the swab inserted up the eye.. *censored
gorey details* ...a couple of extra vicious twists before removing it.
Needless to say it was a few days before my eyes stopped watering...
