Or perhaps, just perhaps, I realize that the beastlord class as it is right
now is *not* anything other than a "fun" class.  And perhaps, just perhaps,
I wanted a "fun" class to have less downtime, and thus more fun.  And perhaps
without that boost that gives it the extra level of "fun" I'd be enjoying
the game more with my established characters (some of whom even wear fungi
tunics).

So yeah, if I find a beastlord with fungi is fun, and one without isn't, I
will "take my ball and go home."  Why?  Because *I* am smart enough to do
what I *enjoy* in this game.

I'd imagine from your response, you would advise people to stick with a
class they dislike, continue watching sitcoms they don't find funny, and
seek out food that tastes a little funny.  Pleasant.  No thanks.
