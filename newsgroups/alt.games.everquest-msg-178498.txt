That's too vague.  I don't accept that answer.  (Yes, I already
know your reply: "Too bad."  Unless you have something more to
add, don't bother to respond.)

In any case, I suspect Verant/SOE may have been full of <bleep>.

: |I never insisted he was incorrect.

I offered an alternative theory.  I made that clear in my post.
By using the word "theory", even.

P.S. By the way, you should really limit your line length to 72
