I'm in much your boat, having just begun playing intnetly about a month 
ago, following a flirtation some years back.

My advice:

a)Get the 'gold box'. It gets you everything, for a decent price, so you 
don't have to worry about not being able to go somewhere.

b)I use DSL, but I understand it's playable at 56K.

c)Everyone will give you a different answer on that.

d)I use Allakhazams Magical Realm; I don't know if it's the best, but it 
serves my needs.

e)While EQ2 looks very spiffy, one thing to remember is that, with 
MMORPGs, maturity counts. EQ has massive amounts of content and has been 
around long enough to be pretty stable. New MMORPGs are spectacular 
fests of crashes, instability, and total changes to core systems.
