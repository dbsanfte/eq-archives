I doubt any bard was AE kiting hill giants. More likely they swarm
kited. If every mob in the swarm goes down simultaneously than it's AE
kiting. Otherwise they swarm. You can try to root one out of the swarm
but it is risky as aggro isn't very firm on the bard so the swarm may
turn to follow you instead. ;)
And there are these morons that will run their swarm over you in
response to your "killstealing"...
