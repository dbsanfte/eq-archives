In the past 2.5 years, I've hunted IGs on Cazic Thule with 6 different
characters at various times starting pre-Luclin, as they are the best
free-standing ATMs in the game (Gornit comes in second).  I know what I'm
talking about.  Heck, it was like that when my baby barb started in the
Everfrost newbie garden in late 2000, and I'd never seen an IG before.  It
became somewhat of a minor goal of mine to be able to answer an IG camp
check one day.  I didn't invent it ... it had to start somewhere.

Your statement that you've never heard of it being three camps only tells me
that you've not been to IGs on CT since 2000.  Send out a camp check next
time you get to Everfrost and see what you get back.  If you get "IGs", I'll
give you a K.  In fact, just tell me your character's name and I'll meet you
at the PoK book for the test.

The three IGs are three separate camps, at least on CT.  It's as much of a
fact as the fact that the spires in SK are considered four different camps
(though the Hill is usually the one that gets abused).  Or the new Aqua Gob
camps in Butcher are two camps (Aqua 1 and Aqua 2).  Or Gornit.  or the
sandbox in Splitpaw.  Or any other camped mob(s) you can think of.

When you get to the brass tacks of it, these types of Gentlemen's Agreement
are what all camps are in EQ.  Without them, I could easily come up,
outdamage someone on a mob and take it.  So long as I threw on it first,
it's my mob ... no matter how long you've been sitting there waiting for it
to pop.  As we all know, Guides and GMs will tell you that there's no
camping in the game.  The fact that they have a an ostrich-like policy
doesn't change the fact that it happens.

Places like Ulthorks, Spirocs, and Toilers are FFA ... whole different
kettle of fish.
