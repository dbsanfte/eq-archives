I used to think this way too, but now it all depends on the peripheral.

When they first started integrating devices onto the motherboard, the
failure rate was really high.  Something as innocent as unplugging a serial
cable could pop the serial port, and that'd take the parallel port with it,
and sometimes even the mouse and keyboard.  I was working 800 tech support
at the time this all started, and I had to ship out a lot of motherboards.

But now they're a lot more reliable.  The only devices that I really don't
like to have integrated are video, sound, and to a lesser extent, scsi. 
Integrated serial, parallel, and network is all fine by me, as long as you
can turn them off.
