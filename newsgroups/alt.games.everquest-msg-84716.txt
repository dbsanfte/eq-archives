And if you sit there for a while, Xilniov will make you his bitch.
All of you.

One at a time.  Hard.

With various utensils and tentacles.

If he shows up, don't listen to what he says.  You've got
a good 45 seconds to run screaming to the zone, and if
you don't come back for 15 minutes, he'll go away.

Pray for him to go away.
