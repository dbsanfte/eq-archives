Since there are no markets which have absolutely no barriers to entry, that
sort of makes your definition / classification pretty meaningless, don't you
think?

Other than that, I don't really understand the point of your analogy.   It
seems to me to fall apart since there is no similar harmful action that they
can take within the game.

This has yet to be established, and is the main point of contention, as far
as I can tell.

Perhaps things have changed since I left, but I don't think I ever saw where
there were less than three enchanters, and often more, all spamming the
nexus offering KEI for "donations"  Not once have I ever seen a fight break
out among them on public channels, as if it was a squabble over a mob camp.

The "grief" that you seem to claim is such a significant barrier appears to
me to be nothing more than empty threats sent in tells.   Simple solution,
/ignore.   And really, what are they going to do about it?   Petition?   A
GM would laugh them out of the zone.  A tell to your guildmaster?   I can't
imagine a guildmaster so paranoid about thier reputation that they would
take such a complaint seriously.  Bitch you out in /shout or /ooc?  They
would be the one that would end up looking like an idiot to the rest of the
zone.   (And perhaps most of them realize that, as I've yet to see one take
this tact.)

Maybe it is just me, but I seriously can't imagine a person spineless enough
to give into these threats, so I fail to see how it can be such a
significant barrier.
