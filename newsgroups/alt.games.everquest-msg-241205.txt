I didn't even realize they were patching until I fired up EQ.. LOL figures.

March 25th, 2004 
-------------------------- 

Headlines 
-------------------------- 

-Refining some DX9 functionality. 

-Some adjustments have been made to pets. 

-Some general bug fixes. 

-Added a new rogue discipline line, Assassins Strike. The tomes can be found in
the East Commonlands and the Plane of Knowledge. 


DirectX 9 
-------------------------- 
-The center of collision for all players 
-We have made improvements to position processing which should alleviate some
of the problems related to getting stuck in geometry. 
-Improved collision and movement when near overhangs. 
-The auto-duck mechanism is now an user-enabled option. It can be set in the
General tab of the options window. This feature forces your character to duck
automatically to get into small places. If set to off, you will need to
manually duck to enter those places. It is "on" by default. 
-Warping of very small NPCs (e.g., giant rats in Qeynos) has been resolved. 
-Rain now has visible weather. 



Pets 
-------------------------- 
60+ player pets have been improved in a number of ways. Most notably, the
effects of pet foci will be more dramatic as a player progresses with more
powerful equipment. There have also been a number of inconsistencies between
different tiers of pet foci that have been fixed. All of the existing foci
should never show a power decrease in any aspect when upgrading from a lower
tier foci to a higher tier foci. The most dramatic changes in pet stats are in
the following aspects: 

Level - Most tiers of Foci will add one level to the pet. 
Max HP - Most tiers of foci will add max hit points to the pet, some tiers are
more dramatic than others and follow a similar rate of progression to player
characters as they gain equipment equivalent to the pet focus items. 
Mitigation (AC, Agility) -- Most tiers of foci will add mitigation to the pet.
Some tiers are more dramatic than others and follow a similar rate of
progression to player characters as they gain equipment equivalent to the pet
focus items. 
Damage Output - Generally the pets did not receive a significant change in
their damage output, although there are certain pets that have had their max
hit and offense increased. 

Overall, the player pets have received a significant boost. There are instances
where you will see no change in a specific aspect of a specific pet. For
example, the Rathe’’s Son pet summoned with Minion of Eternity has not
received an improvement in max hit points, but it has received a significant
mitigation improvement. 

These changes affect the pets summoned by the following spells: 

Ward of Xegony 
Child of Ro 
Servant of Marr 
Rathe’s Son 
Legacy of Zek 
Saryrn’s Companion 
Child of Bertoxxulous 
Spirit of Sorsha 
Spirit of Arag 

The most profound changes were made to the magician pets as they were most in
need of improvement to maintain class balance. Beastlord and necromancer pets
also received upgrades, but not of the same magnitude.
