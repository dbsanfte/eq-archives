LOL ... I guess so ... but let's reflect on my original post on this
matter.

I originally posted and asked why so many people flame top posters in
this group .. when the groups I frequent have majority top posters. (To
my knowledge I have never top posted in this group and indeed in most
of the other groups I frequent)

At that stage I was called a top poster, a liar and various profanities
by the Sisson and the Cat (to this day I am not sure why but whatever).

I then did a count which proved my point over a couple of days and
posted that to which I was subject to another round of abuse.
Interestingly others joined in the lambasting ... obviously they had
not read the original ... contextually posted first thread (an
interesting argument against bottom posting) because they did not
bother to go back and just assumed wrongly that I was defending top
posting and did it myself.

So I started another thread pointing to one of my newsgroups (which is
a majority top posting group OE or otherwise) where they had roiunded
soundly on a bottom poster who was trying to correct them.

Am I an idiot or a fool .. no I am a sane individual who still hasn't
had my original question answered in a clear way ... I repeat ... Why
is this the only newsgroup, I inhabit, that soundly and roundly abuses
(not cheerfully usually) top posters?
