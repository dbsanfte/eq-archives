I used to be an avid player, then due to 2 guild breakups & the launch of
DAoC I switched to play ing that. Lately I've been getting an urge to start
playing EQ again & was looking for some advice. My main character is a lvl
53 half elven ranger. Being halfelven & a ranger U can tell I've spent alot
of time on him. Question I have is should I try to keep working on him, get
him up to 60 with epics or should play one of my alts (I have 7 all below
10) or should I just start again on a new server. Reason I'm not to keen on
going back to playing my ranger is that no one ever seems to need one in a
grp. Also lvling him & getting his epic would require finding a good guild.
I'm on Sol Ro incase you were wondering. Your advice would be welcome.

Thanks Manny
