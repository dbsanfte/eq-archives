You know, I worded that original post in the most neutral way possible,
in an extreme effort not to sound like I was judging other peoples
opinions.  Because of his knowledge of EQ, I did weigh Matt's
opinion of DAoC before getting involved.  But the fact remains, that
his tastes don't necessarily reflect mine, and from what I've seen
so far, DAoC may be a better fit for my time constraints and tastes.
Whatever the reason, different expectations/less time playing (on
my part) our opinion of DAoC differs.  Obviously our tastes differ,
because he enjoys the EQ endgame, and that burned me out.  Simply
jumping in and flaming him (and Furor and company) because
DAoC didn't meet their expectations is stupid, it descends to the
"My game is better than your game - neener neener neener" level,
which is about equal to the "My dad can beat up your dad" school
of argument.
