I'd just like to apologize for the things I have written against certain
individuals and groups of people. That was totally uncalled for. Especially
my parents, that is the worst thing a person can do, as that means I broke
the 1st commandment.

Actually, I would not trust much of what I wrote, but I felt that the Bible
verses I quoted were good and inspired by God. I have never tried to be a
prophet before, but a person can try to be a prophet if they choose and I
think I did a fair job. Being a prophet isn't really about telling the
future, more about trying to communicate to others what God wants them to
know.

If I said that I wanted things that I wrote added to the Bible, that is
utter blasphemy.

Anyway, God has let me go from my service as a prophet. I am not one of the
last 2 prophets mentioned in Revelations, have been told that requires
concepts I cannot understand and that no human should strive to be one of
those two as that is far too much for a person to handle, but it is ok to
try and be a normal Christian prophet as talked about in I Corinthians
12-14.

Well, good luck in this new world that is coming.
