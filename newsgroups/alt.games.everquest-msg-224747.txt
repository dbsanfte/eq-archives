Hi all.

Coming back to EQ yet again and have a question.  Is LDoN for a certain
level range?  Most folks I see talking about it are rather high level but in
game I got the trigger msg., the Wayfarer Brotherhood one, somewhere around
10-15.  I will most likely buy this but having just started yesterday and
only lvl 20 was going to hold off if I can't use it yet.  Unless of course
there is more content in the form of spells, items, etc that can be used
now.

Thanks
