: I don't live anywhere near Georgia, but I've heard the term "rules
: rape" used for at least the last 21 years.  I've always heard it in
: the context of someone abusing the rules in a tabletop RPG, by
: adhereing to the strict letter of the rules to take advantage of
: loopholes and errors.  It's been in pretty common usage in all that
: time, not just by the gaming community, but by the game companies
: themselves.  It's especially prevelant as a term in "point based"
: systems such as the Hero Games system, or GURPS.  Mostly because such
: systems have more loopholes than a strict level based system such as
: AD&D.

  Thank you.  I do, however, apologize to anyone who was offended by the
term.  It is not intended to lessen the impact of the term or act or
"rape."  It is a horrible thing and should be viewed as such.  I apologize
to anyone who was offended by my usage of the term "rules rape."
