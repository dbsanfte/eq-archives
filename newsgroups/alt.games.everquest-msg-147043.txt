If you are Agnostic you might have a chance I know my Enchanter can enter
Neriak. If you do worship a deity then the next thing would be to Load up on
Red Wine 400-500 bottles should do the trick. Enter Neriak Invised, head to
3rd gate in the Library left hand side there is a guy that will build
faction for a bottle of Red Wine. Builds faction with Merchants, Inner and
Outer Guards, once inside the Library I have never seen a guard enter or get
close enough to agro. I have a Dwarf Cleric that can Enter Neriak with no
problem but it took close to 1000 bottles of wine
