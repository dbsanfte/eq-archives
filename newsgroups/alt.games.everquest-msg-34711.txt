However, WHAT other people?  Guildmates or strangers?  If guildmates don't
charge...just tell apologize and tell them the truth...that after 4 bars
you're OOM and have to med 5 minutes to get it back and you'd honestly just
like to get to level 9 (or whatever the next level is).

If it's a stranger, damn right, charge 'em if it's more than one or 2 bars.
My person policy is to never charge for enchanting for quests (well, I don't
think you have THAT to worry about until level 34).  Beyond that I either
politely tell them no, "I don't have the time, sorry," or see how much
they're willing to pay me.  For a stack of silver at level 8 it would take a
minimum 4 full supplies of mana and 20 minutes of my time I'd probably
charge a couple plat (5 tops, I think...but that's me).
