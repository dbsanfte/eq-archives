Yeah, I know what spamming a zone is.  I see it ALL the time. and the OOC
channel is NOT for personal conversations.  it's for out of character
communications, yes, NOT "Hi johny! *hugs*" "Oh hey! we went to a party last
night and so and so was there" or  "Hi soandso! i got my new car!"

Nor is it for little twits to brag about how l33t they are.

My ignore list is quite full, and I don't care to turn off the channel as I
myself use it on the rare occasion.  The nitwits who think that OOC or SHOUT
are their personal chatrooms need a wakeup call.
