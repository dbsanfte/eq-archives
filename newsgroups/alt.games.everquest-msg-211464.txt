Just thought it might be of interest to some that I just ran a log parse on
a short (2 fights in PoN) log on my 57SK. He's still using the 52 pet, which
I'm told is a 33 skelley. Against PoN mobs this pet does about 8.72dps or
the equivalent of a 52dmg/tick dot. Definitely worth summoning and getting
that shammy to buff him!

This was hasted by a 56 shammy. My own DPS, including spells and mellay came
out at 38.4 for that log.

Total SK DPS including melee, spells and pet: 47.12

Which is considerably more dmg than the mobs were doing to me ;)

Interestingly, the shammy's pet hauled in a thunderous 27.5 dps.

Cheers,
James
