Until recently I wasplaying EQ on a Celeron 300A, 128 meg of RAM, 16
Meg Vood0o 3 and a Soundblaster live 1024.....it played fine...OK I didnrt
have new models and a lot of graphical stuff was turned down low but it
DID play quite happily. Luclin was a bit problematic because of the
ambient sound and the 1024...oph and Im on a 56k

The above had Velious and Kunark being used.

Kunark and old world ran absoutely fine...Velious pretty much OK though I
stayed in CC/EW Thurg area. Zoning time was an issue and there were the
odd graphical judders....

OTOH Ive recently spent 20 quid on a second hand Geforce2, 40 quid on new
memory (256Meg) and a further 40 quid on a new Audigy soundcard....and
this now runs like a dream..the grpahic card meant the clip plane could be
pushed out, a number of options increased and the lockups occured less,
the sound card really makes Luclin run SOOO much better as it doesnt dump
on the CPU so much in high ambient sound areas..the memory made a
noticeable difference with an extra 128 meg, and the 256 was really
good...(quartered the zone time at least)

Short answer - that system will struggle to play it but it will play it
with acceptance of a few minor issues, mainly zone time and staying out of
ambient sound areas as much as possible and only a few tweaks will make it
run really well.
