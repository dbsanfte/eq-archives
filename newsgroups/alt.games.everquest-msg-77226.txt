That's my enchanter's problem now -- I haven't played her in so long that
all she had was about 28pp in the bank. I wanted to get her some exp as well
as some pp. Her Cha is too low at 102, so I'm also trying to get some cha
items for her and I know they ain't cheap. In fact, I'll prolly have to run
the quests for those myself. Hmm... wonder if it would be a good idea to
start her over. When I rolled her up, I wasn't aware of the fact that
enchanters needed cha more than int. So she has 120 int and 102 cha :(

thanks,
Darklet
