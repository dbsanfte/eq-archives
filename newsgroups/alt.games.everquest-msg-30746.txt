So if you're set on the tunnel, make it the North Ro side  to avoid the
auction spam. I wouldn't pick the tunnel personally, bit of a bland
location, some hole in a rock somewhere. Near freeport/Neriak/commons
seems about the only easy to get to location for goods and evils, but if
you're going to do North Ro, maybe the platform, or the little shrine
thing? Or the barbarian fishing village - make it a beach wedding :)
