Well, I almost hate to say it but Outlook Express is really good.  It's what
I use and while it comes by default with some really stupid settings (HTML
posts, ugh), you can customize it to do just about anything you want.  I've
got mine set to post in text, quote the way I like, bottom-post, the whole
works.

About the only thing it can't do is download separated binaries and mash
them automatically into a whole - but I don't go to binaries newsgroups
anyway.

OE has the advantage of being free if you have Windows.

Just wanted to toss in the obvious answer.
