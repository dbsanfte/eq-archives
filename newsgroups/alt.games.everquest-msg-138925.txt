I'm under the impression that the bottleneck is more a server thing, the 
server doesn't like having 3-400 people in the same zone all close by 
potentially seeing dozens of others all at once. I've got a nice system 
with a GeForce4 Ti4600 and it still lags a lot in the bazaar. I turn clip 
plane all the way, that helps a great deal, but upgrading to the newest 
video cards won't make horrible frame rates go away (it will improve, but 
I don't want people thinking it will eliminate it). I can still deal with 
people while not looking at a wall or the floor, but I generally do anyway 
because frame rates improve drastically.
