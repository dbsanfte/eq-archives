   Probably, but maybe not.  I just know that I wouldn't want to accidentally
end up on someone's mental shit-list just because my name is similar to a
jerkwad.  It might not affect my gameplay if I were, or it might in ways I
didn't recognize such as not getting invited into a group or getting a mercy
rez.

   Hm.  I think I didn't make myself clear.  I'd want details all right, but
then I'd offer "legal" means of dealing with the problem.  Sending juvenile
harassing tells?  No, I don't like any of my guildees that much.
