I disagee. I think the recommended levels they've added could make lower
level loot attractive to the appropriate level people, if it's used
consistantly. The current loot dropping in LDoN shows this well. At
least the stuff I see dropping in L65 normal missions is ok for people
who would find those missions a challenge, though it certainly doesn't
impress anyone in a raiding guild, but it's all also totally undesirable
for a twink of any less than 10 levels lower than the recommended level.
Stuff dropping on hard missions is considerably better, though not quite
good enough considering how much better geared you already have to be to
win them.
