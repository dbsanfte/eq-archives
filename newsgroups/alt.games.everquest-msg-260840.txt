Yes, it's pretty well agreed that skillups are quite a bit more
likely (perhaps twice as likely?) on successes, so what Chuck is
seeing is probably just the dropoff in skillup rate at higher
skill levels, which can be quite dramatic indeed.

The tradeoff of geerloks (to improve successes and hence skillups)
vs a primary slot item that adds to your WIS or INT (which also
improves skillups) is tricky.  If you're a caster or hybrid, though,
you probably have a pretty good WIS/INT even without that slot.  My
druid, for instance, is WIS 190 unbuffed, and has gear in the bank
that she switches to when training tradeskills to boost her WIS to
about 215.  She loses 8 WIS if she uses a geerlok, but I'm not sure
if it matters; there's an upper limit beyond which the learning stat
doesn't help, and I think it's in the low 200s.

Actually, my theory is that the chance of skillup depends largely on
the difference between the learning stat and the trivial (or perhaps
the learning stat and your current skill), such that getting the stat
much past 200 doesn't help a lot until you're trying for skill levels
that are also past 200, in which case the geerlok is making a big
difference on success rate.  So I just always use it.

Frankly, my biggest problem with the geerlok is that I sometimes
forget to switch back to opal steins before buying more ingredients
or selling off my successes, but I'd have the same problem with my
WIS item in the primary slot, too!
