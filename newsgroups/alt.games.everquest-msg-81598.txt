I agree totally. I love my guild in most ways but in any guild raid, all
cash drops go to the clerics, and I've seen what is going to the clerics and
there is no way they aren't making a huge profit. I'd much rather pony up 50
pp to go on a raid to cover the symbol cost and have everyone get a chance
on the cash drops. It's kind of a sore point to me. Even Blue Diamonds are
given to the clerics, and man that burns my butt. I've been a broke ass monk
my whole Eq life; this is my main character, so I've never been twinked.
I've never been able to afford the weapons I see many of the monks lower
than me running around with. Just in the last couple of weeks I have looted
some really nice weapons, but prior to that it took me 25 levels to afford a
fighting baton, and then another 5 to afford a CoT. Now that I can hunt
where some of these nice cash items drop, I'd sure like a chance at them. I
had a guy offer me a IFS the other day for 12K. I'd jumped all over it
except for the fact that I've only got 2K in the bank.
