"Upcoming April 2004
We have an update tentatively scheduled for April 14th.

This update should include many fixes for targeting and collisions, as well 
as adding the ability to cycle through targets."

Chanters of the world, rejoice.

Rangers of the world, ASSIST!!!

'You're not friends. You'll never be friends. You'll be in love till it 
kills you both. You'll fight, and you'll shag, and you'll hate each other 
till it makes you quiver, but you'll never be friends. Love isn't brains, 
children, it's blood... blood screaming inside you to work its will. I may 
be love's bitch, but at least I'm man enough to admit it.'
