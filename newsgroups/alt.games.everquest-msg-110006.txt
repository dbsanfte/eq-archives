Since your previous post mention EC orc camps and Ro Derv camps, it sounds
like your cleric is at a yound stage;  say sub 20.  If that is the case,
then when looking for gear to improve your spell casting, be sure to also
check out +mana gear.  While +wis will be a dual benefit of increasing wis
for skillups and increasing mana, the ratio of mana to wis is lower at these
levels.  Geez, I wish I could be more help on the ratio, or location for a
good mana calculator, but its been awhile for my alt cleric.  I think at
30th she gets 6 mana per wis point, so a +20 mana item is akin to a +3 wis
item.  Since the ratio is less at lower levels, it would be like a +4 or +5
wis item.

A skull from Lake Rathear gnolls (Skull of Jen t'rhah ??) is +20 mana,
fairly common, and very cheap.  Polished Bone Bracers (2 AC +3 Wis/INT) run
about 75-90 pp on my server.  Also don't overlook the ever-popular Testament
of Vanear quest, though you would probably need help to get into Qeynos. The
result is a +10 Wis +10 mana NODROP book that many people carry into their
40s. Ulthork Hide tunics are 200+pp and +3 Wis +35 mana (at the cost of  AC
and -Hps). Splitpaw gloves are dirt cheap and +2 wis. Forest Loops are down
to about 200-300pp.  Zarahan's Coronet (head gear) is +25 mana for around
150pp. Adamantite Pauldrons still run around 500-700 pp. Crystalline Belt
from Crystal Caverns is +3 or +5 Wis for a few hundred pp.  Some cheap +1
or +2 items (cloak, hammer) come out of the Netherbain Lair.  Then theres
Sporestrand Sheild and Black Medallions (Iron, and Alloy) from Runnyeye.
Also don't forget player made jewelry, but I'll let someone who knows about
those speak on em. ;)
