/agree - hence the reason I put in the qualified "doesn't like it 
enough"  Although I would have better written "when the negatives
of EQ outweigh the positives"  Just because you don't like some
aspects of EQ doesn't mean you should stop playing - it's when playing
is truly more trouble than it's worth.  For me that point was 
reached during that fiasco surround DX9.  With all the changes they've
made, they still haven't done enough to get me to resubscribe.

While CoH didn't hold me - I simply haven't found a reason to
re-up.  A simple lack of anything better just isn't enough for me.

Meanwhile I just keep hoping that a fun MMORPG comes out that has
what I want, and play Laser Squad Nemesis :)
