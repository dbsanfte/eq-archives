The problem is you aren't operating in a vacuum when you compare exp
from one zone to the next. When in CB, you probably have a steadier
stream of mobs to kill than you would have in Gfay. So of course you
would gain exp faster. As well, mobs in CB, even if they share names
with those in Gfay, are often higher level, and therefore worth more
exp. The orc pawns aggro in Gfay, you have to kill them for less exp
even though they cause you more downtime. I found it much easier to
find singles inside Crushbone, in Gfay I seemed to always pull
multiples, which would cause more downtime or even death. However, if
you run an experiment, kill several even cons in Gfay and the same
number in Crushbone, you will get more exp for the Gfay kills.

It is not easy to tell by just killing a mob, if you watch the exp
bars they are not perfect at representing exp gains, I have seen a
quarter of a blue bubble for a kill and a half a blue bubble for a
kill of the same level. Perception is just not reliable enough. In OT
you may have a steadier stream of mobs, less competition for kills,
perhaps less over pulls, and the end result might well be that you
gain exp faster than you would in LoIO. That doesn't change the fact
that an equal level mob in a newbie zone is worth more than one in a
wilderness zone.

All the zones you mention above are newbie zones, and they all have
higher modifiers than any wilderness zone. They also used to be higher
than any dungeon zone, though that did change with the exp bonuses
added a few months back. Even so, most newbie zones are still higher
than most dungeons. Also, all newbie zones do not have the same
modifiers.

Here is a link to an older article about Exp in general, there is a
section on the Zone Experience Modifiers (the same ZEM mentioned in
the producer's letter when they upped it for several under used
zones): http://www.eqguide.com/articlesold/showeq.html

After all is said and done though, you are right, the modifiers are
not nearly as important as finding a good hunting ground. Oasis is one
of the most popular zones, it has no bonuses, just the 75 ZEM that
most outdoor zones have, but it has tons of easy to kill solo mobs.
Ditto Southern Karana, people hunt there because Aviaks are easy to
kill and don't aggro unless attacked.
