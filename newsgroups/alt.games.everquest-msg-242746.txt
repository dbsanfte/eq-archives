Enchanter: Primary jobs - defense, buffs. Also slows and DPS. Enchanters
have several lines of spells to control enemies: they can mesmerize, stun,
charm, and lull. Dangerous areas with lots of enemy traffic, groups that
don't have a skilled puller, and groups fighting tough mobs will benefit
from, if not require, the Enchanter. Enchanters can control groups of
enemies while the rest of the party focuses on one at a time (this is, where
applicable, the most efficient way to plough through enemies). The can slow
and lessen the attacks of those enemies, skills that move from convenient to
essential as one levels up. Thier buffs include the best haste for melee
attacks and the best regeneration spells for mana. Enchanter charm, which
works on all types of mobs (except some special rares), is a powerful tool
when the player is trained in its use. The best Enchanter pays very close
attention to his party's surroundings and the incoming enemies.

Ranger: Primary role - offense, pulling. Also, the Ranger has some decent
utility spells, such as SoW and snare. While able to pass for a tank up
until the 50's, the Ranger's main duty is pouring out damage, either from
swords or his bow, once he has trained it appropriately. Once in the 50's,
he will recieve Jolt and will do well to learn to use it; it lessens the
chance that the engaged enemy will beat him into pulp. The Ranger's great
damage will call attention to him, but his defensive abilities will lag far
behind his offense. The Ranger will also snare his enemies and SoW his group
mates, making it easy to catch prey or flee difficult enemies, and the
Ranger can use outdoor-only pacification to split up groups of enemies,
allowing the group to kill most efficienty. Starting at level 51, the Ranger
receives double damage on stationary (but not rooted, i.e., mobs that
someone else is engaging in melee) enemies, and then at 59 he can begin
training Archery Mastery and Endless Quiver, two skills that define the high
level ranger. When completing that training, the Ranger can deliver
consistent and impressive damage without any toll. The Ranger also has the
tracking ability, which makes quests and hunting in general a lot easier.

i'm trying to be as concise as possible, and i wonder if it would be so bad
to interject a little more?

i'll post more summaries about some other classes, assuming these are
helpful
