Wow, interesting stuff about development of several mmorpgs.

I agree. SOE is a lot more guarded about information. They don't like
to share any since they don't want the competition to know what to do,
or what not to do.

I seem to remember everquest also drastically underestimating initial
launch numbers. It makes sense back then, though. Today there is
really no excuse for doing that. All in all, I seem to remember the
launch really being surprisingly smooth.
