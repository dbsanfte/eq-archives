It's the Ghoulbane, paladin-only 1hs with a Dismiss Undead random
proc. Don't know if non-paladins can do the quest and get the sword,
but I doubt it.

Very briefly you must talk to NPCs in NK, Butcher, Dagnar, LavaStorm
and get some NoDrops in HighKeep (Amstaff scroll), Butcher (Hilt),
Unrest (Ghoul heart) and Najena (Blade?)
