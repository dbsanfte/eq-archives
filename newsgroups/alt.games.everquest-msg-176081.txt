biggest downside on pl-ing and twinking in general is that your skills will
not grow as fast as you are levelling, wich means that at the moment pl-ing
stops you'll most likely be suffering it for a while until the skills come
back up decently enough. I've pl-ed a ranger (who recreated his char with
all gear he had) in a very short time to 20, at lvl 5 taking elitegnolls in
blackburrow. and from lvl 10 we went to pc. DS is a real great thing when
casted on a lower char. Anyway the result was that at 20 he couldn't even
solo a single mob anywhere castingskills totally neglected etc. etc. it took
him quite some time to get his skills decently balanced. So is pl-ing a good
thing? when it is for one or two lvls it ure can be, but when skills are
significantly lacking, there'll be revenge for it. On the other hand someone
trying real hard but just not breaking that lvl before they get new
spells/skill wich should carry them further might benefit from a bit of
pl-ing significantly. So some consideration has to be made,

happy hunting and safe travelling
