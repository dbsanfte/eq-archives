Not trying to diss your points in the rest of the post, but it looked like 
the topic might be able to split into two parallel discussions, both of 
which might prove interesting.  I was trying to encourage that.

}And that is very bad, and very dangerous to society at large, but

Well, I don't think it's stretching 'discrimination' at all to ask for 
acceptance.  But different strokes, as you say.

Scenarios.  And you can't really 'prove' things by example, but whatever. 
:)

Say, for example... someone's mate comes to pick them up after work so 
they can go out to dinner together.  I think it would be unfair to expect 
them to be all sneaky-sneaky and keep everyone from finding out you were 
meeting someone for a date just because they happened to be the same 
gender, unless you also expect the hetero couple to be all sneaky.

}preference, sexual desire... Again, at WORK, I have no sex, no sexual
}preference, no nothing like that!

Funny, EQ seems to disagree with you about that. :) But, there is a 
difference between not having a sexual preference and not discussing it.

}> }If a guy walks around the city in a dress, he's gonna get snarals.

It would still be pretty novel, yes.  It would probably be more unnerving, 
and I'd be a lot less likely to do it again.

Apparently, some of us came equipped with different logic circuits. 
*shrug*  Mother nature does not seem to disapprove.

Well, that would be impossible.  And absolutely no cost might actually 
make it less fun.  So no, I don't want that.

}Thoes are only some of the costs.

True, an exhaustive list would be pretty time-consuming to research, so I 
just went with one of the biggies.

}The one being addressed here is the
}one that you are attempting to get waved to either forward your cause,
}or to get noticed, or both.  I personally think its only the later.

Get waived?  No, it's not geting waived.  There's no way around those 
costs.  Unless by 'addressed here' you mean the 'societal discrimination' 
cost.  In which case, my motive for wanting it waived is that I think it's 
patently ridiculous.  Personally, I don't seem to have much trouble 
getting noticed.  Sometimes, it's a bit -too- much notice, even.

}> }> (c) This is not a sudden re-definition, our society seems to have been

}As little as 15-20 years ago the term "PC" was meaningless.

The abbreviation may be new, yes.  But Merriam-Webster lists 'Politically 
Correct' with a date of 1936.  And, more to the point, the struggle for 
gay acceptance is older than the PC movement.  Much, much, older.  It's 
very convenient to label it as PC so you can write it off, but actually it 
has very little to do with PC by the dictionary definition, "coforming to 
a belief that language and practices which could offend political 
sensibilities (as in matters of sex or race) should be eliminated."  The 
issue isn't about offending their political sensibilities, it's about 
treating them as equals.

}I'm not saying that they "should" be ridiculed, but more to the point

So you're saying you're genetically predisposed to ridicule my friends, 
and can't stop?  What?  Or are you saying that since the majority seems to 
ridicule my friends, you should too, or at very least you feel obligated 
not to intervene?

}the actual understanding of human nature, society, and is 
}self-serving, and purposely ignores all other aspects of society,
}and hence the "selfishness" part of the argument.

It is not 'just to be a rebel'.  If I see society doing something I 
think is patently unfair and unreasonable, I will take it on.  Our society 
is not perfect, nor are the rules set in stone.  Some battles are more 
winnable, true, but I think this one can at least have significant 
progress made in my lifetime... Especially since there seems to have 
already been significant progress within my life so far. :)  How is it 
selfish to want a better society for -everyone-?  I do not feel that it 
ignores all other aspects of society.  It doesn't even relate to 3/4 of 
how society functions.  Yes, it contradicts some parts that I think are 
bad.  You can imagine how much it upsets me, the idea of replacing 
something bad with something better.  I stay up late crying about it on 
hot summer nights.

It would be hard to type that way.  Care to provide an example?

I'm not, I'm fine with it costing them.  But, making them provide benefits 
to a bunch of single people who may not use them may make it appear to 
THEM to be too expensive for us to convince them to do it.  It's still 
sounds like a good idea, though.

}So you are now "rationalizing" aborant behavious now ???  How does 
}THAT work ??  If you wish to forward your argument on "PRINCIPAL"
}(as opposed to selfishness), then your solutions should answer on
}PRINCIPAL as well!

Well, on principle, I see nothing immediately wrong with it, I just don't 
get it.  My sister is not my type. *shrug*.  It seems like a lot of the 
potential motivation would be removed with the 'benefits for all' plan you 
suggested above.

}> Well, all right, tehnically, I married my sister.  
}Ahh, thats better.
}> But that's 
}> because I'm a minister, and I owed her, because she was one of the 
}> ministers at my wedding too.  Shortly after we teamed up to marry our 
}> parents.  
}Then the church should pay your benifits then - better yet.

Heheh, that would require the church having money. :)  Theoretically, if 
we were organized about it, we could use our ministry to get out of taxes.  
But hey, the government does some good things now and then, I don't really 
mind chipping in.  Mostly, our ministries are only really useful for 
marrying people.

}> But basically, if someone wants to marry their sibling, I don't really 
}> have a problem with that.  I would, however, advise them not to reproduce 
}> with each other, because inbreeding is just not healthy. 
}Why worry about "health" with the whole AIDS thing with gays ??

Umm.  I worry about that too?  Similarly, I'd strongly recommend not 
having unprotected intercourse outside of a long-term, committed 
relationship with a partner you actually know well enough to trust.

}> I think it'd 
}> probably be much harder to get laws passed supporting that, though.
}Why, because we don't have YOU, and your types going to bat for it ?
}(The "principal" thing, or lack thereof ...)

Are you saying you -want- to marry your sister, but have been prevented 
from doing so?  I'd be glad to perform the ceremony, if you want.  And 
yes, that is more or less why.  I could show my support for it, but I'd 
probably be the only one, wouldn't I?  Whereas, in this othercase, it 
looks like a winnable battle.  Maybe after that we can work on the sibling 
marriage thing, if society's in a better mood for it.

}> As to your actual response to this bit, I'm afraid I don't quite follow 
}> you.  When I say 'dunno', it's usually the equivalent of a shrug.  I 
}> didn't see how sibling marriage realy relates to the rest of the argument.
}Man! - you are cornered huh?  little "check-mate" here huh. Interesting!
}So its about sexual preference only when its YOUR sexual preference.
}So its about "principal" ONLY when such principal fits YOUR case.
}...I rest my case (and you gained no credible support)

Err, if you say so.  Now that you have clarified, I do see how it relates.  
I didn't then, so I said 'dunno'.  I dunno what it is about that word that 
sets you off so.  And ay I just point out again... this is not about MY 
sexual preference.  This is -entirely- about principle.  I do think the 
same prnciple applies, but it would be a much less winnable battle.

}> }Better yet, why not fight the battle with the angle of keeping ALL sexual 
}> }preference out of the workplace etc.
}> If you want to keep ALL sexual preference out of the workplace, that would 
}> be acceptable to me.  But good luck. Accepting queer relationships on an 
}> equal footing sounds like a much more achievable goal. 
}Hows about tollerating ALL relationships, or removing ALL relationships?

Right.  Either of those would be perfectly acceptable.  I think you will 
get much further on the 'tolerating' case than the 'removing' case, 
though.  I don't see how you think 'tolerating ALL relationships' is 
dfferent from 'accepting [the discriminated against] relationships on 
equal footing'.

But it sounds like we agree here.  Are you sure that can be tolerated?

}You speak with fork-tongue, with variations/deaviations ONLY when it
}applies to you. Weak, your overall lack of principals (as a whole)
}leaves you with deminishing credibility, and dimming attention.

And that agreement really contrasts strangely with this collection of ad 
hominem attacks...

}> What sort of rules 
}> would we need?  Hmm...  no pictures of friends or family on your desks.  
}> Don't even -think- about dating a coworker.  No flirting.  Everybody'd 
}> probably have to wear shapeless, drab uniforms. It sounds like it'd result 
}> in a very boring place to work.
}Work is not a drag-queen party. Nor it is a pick-up club, a street corner
}in San Fran.  

Maybe not your work. :)  Strangely enough, there's businesses on street 
corners in SF, and they hire people.  And pick-up clubs have a payroll.  
Not everyone is a sysadmin, and even many sysadmins are prone to a little 
office gossip by the wine cooler, or bringing birthday cakes for their 
coworkers, or having a little halloween costume contest.

If you really want to eliminate sex from the workplace entirely, you're 
pretty much going to have to eliminate all possible socialization and 
fraternization between your employees, because, God forbid, they might ask 
what you're up to this weekend, and it might involve getting laid.  (Yes, 
it's true, even some sysadmins get laid now and then... :) )  Or they 
might want to get together and watch the game on Sunday, which might be a 
good plan, if you could bring your spouse, but oh no!  We can't mention 
that at work, can we?
