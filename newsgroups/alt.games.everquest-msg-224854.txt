My friend recently upgraded his computer from a pentium 3 to a pentium 4 2.4
ghz with 512Mb DDR ram and 128 Mb GF4 graphics card but has run into major
problems with Everquest. He has windows XP and Norton security installed.
His problem is that he keeps on getting disconnected from EQ. At first it
was only when he zoned but now it happens when he tries to log on. He gets
so far and then is just disconnected. At first he thought the problem could
be norton security but the same thing happened when he disabled it. He has
contacted EQ Tech support and reported the problem a few days ago and only
got an automated response. In the meantime he is unable to play EQ. I was
hoping some of you may have an idea as to what may be causing the problem.

Thank you
