Racial abilities start as you noticed at 50, they will stay there unless
you also get the ability as a class skill. Then they can go up once you
get high enough to increase the cap for the skill above 50 in your case.

Sneak and Hide are not cleric skills so for you they are 50 fixed and no
increases....

Also as you are not a rogue you dont get information on whether they have
worked - when it says 'You begin to sneak' it means you have activated the
skill, not that you know it has worked - this is the same for other
classes with the skills (eg rangers of any kind get hide and sneak
eventually and they dont know if it has worked or not).

What is happening with the monsters aggroing on you when you hide is that
you have attempted to hide and failed - you see a message that says 'You
start to hide' or similar, but that doesnt give you the success.....

To tell if hide has worked your groupmates can tell you - or any PC in the
zone who can tell you if they can see you or not. Also I believe that the
button wont reset if the hide was successful so if reset time goes by you
may be able to tell if it has worked by waiting (useful for medding)

To tell if sneak has worked, wait for the message and then move forward -
if you are dramatically slower then its working...it stops people aggroing
on you if you are behind them (and only behind them) - on my ranger its
main use is that while sneaking successfully and in the right place the
mob is indifferent to you giving a cheap faction boost to allow you to
trade with certain mobs (eg frosthome dwarves) who dont really like you,
or similarly complete quests with people who arent hugely friendly.
