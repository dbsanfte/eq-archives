Necros in their mid-30s solo in Lguk, something no druid could do.

Lguk is probably the best zone in the game for necros, really. And takes
them from mid-30s though mid-50s with ease.

The difference basically is that necros do not need to be outdoors to solo
well, and druids do. Realistically, how many quad-kitable areas are there?
Not a whole lot, and plenty of competition from other druids, wizards, and
others for the limited selection of hunting available.
