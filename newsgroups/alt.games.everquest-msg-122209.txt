Mm, because it annoys me that someone thinks they're too good to have
the same rules applied to them as the rest of us? Key word: Annoys.
Not "pisses off". There is a serious difference.

Exactly: JUST LIKE I DO. I don't want to see those names. The game
sets a fantasy environment. Those names disrupt that environment. We
are guests on VI's servers, and our hosts say those names aren't
allowed. "Rights" don't come into play here. They set the rules. Don't
like them, leave.

Oh, get over it. Go play Quake if you DON'T want roleplay instead of
playing a MMORPG. You do know what those last three letters stand for.
Here's a little hint: ROLEPLAYING game.

Gee, roleplaying in a roleplaying game. Tough concept to grasp, I
know, but you'll get it if you try hard enough.
