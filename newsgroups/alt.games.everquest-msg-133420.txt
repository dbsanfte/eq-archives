That's one of my biggest complaints. A recent election in Alabama
contained a vote on whether or not we'd get a state lottery. Polls
were held in churches. Churches that had bulliten boards with signs
about the upcoming sermon against gambling. Churches that were HUGELY
outspoken against the lottery.

Guess what? Big surprise here: The lottery was voted down. How many
even semi-religious Christian-leaning types out there are going to
vote in something under "pressure" like this from the religious
authorities?
