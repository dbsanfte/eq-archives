The combination of the AC, and the meager attack bonus from the str on the
jagged bands will add up to far more benefit than 65 hitpoints. Course, the
point is moot with the velium fire opal...then you get the ac AND the
hitpoints.

A lot of it depends on whether those extra ac points will push you over a
benchmark AC point. 600/650/700/750/etc have far more meaning than
599/649/699/749/etc. When you hit certain plateaus of AC, there is a HUGE
downturn in the ability of mobs to hit you. If the jagged band pushes you
over this, then without question, it is the way to go. If however, your ac
with the 65 hp ring is say...610, then the jagged band won't be benefitting
as much as it possibly could. I would keep it in the bank for later
upgrades (or defense skill increases) that would again put you at a notable
level. The hitpoints are always expendable...particularly in a ring, where
there are really not very many good AC items available (short of having
major guild assistance).
