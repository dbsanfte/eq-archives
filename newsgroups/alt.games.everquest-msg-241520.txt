   Yeah.  Today Teapray rezzed Lentea back into Paineel after she lost an
argument with a yellow Shadowknight.  Lentea showed up at her body, Teapray
healed her up, then she then mysteriously got teleported to a very small room
that had the loc's for the teleports engraved on the walls.  Pulling up the map
showed that she was in the along the lower middle edge of the map where there
was no geography drawn in.

   Well, since she hadn't looted anything, I just had her nuke herself to death,
rather than wait for someone to hear her plaintive cries via /petition and let
her out.  Yeah, I had to eat a full death on that, but I'm finding that with her
new pet exp is coming pretty easy anyways.  Annoying though?  Very.
