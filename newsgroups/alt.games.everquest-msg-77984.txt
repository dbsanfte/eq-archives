Thanks for the link!  I read the forum on this subject a little further.  It
was like 9 pages, jeez!  One subject that kept coming up was the "Umbra"
graphics engine.  One person claimed to add the line UseUmbra=FALSE to their
eqclient.ini file.  I tried it and it works great!  Cuts down on the
choppiness considerably.
Next I will have to try what you mentioned.  Again thanks for the link.  It
will be a little more fun to play tonight.

Sean...
