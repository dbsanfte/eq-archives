Rogues get a chance at a throwing crit (4 X weapon damage).

If you hit the rear of a Mob while throwing, you get a chance at landing a
"Deadly Strike" (10 X weapon damage).  Nice little PR message that all in
the area can see.

Level 60 Rogues can also land an "assassinate" blow on certain Mobs by using
a thrown weapon as well as a backstab.  (32,000 damage).

Can't wait to do that :-)
