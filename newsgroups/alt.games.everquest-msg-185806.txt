You can do a couple of things,

Disable the process EM_EXEC.EXE this will turn off the drivers to the mouse,
the wheel will work in EQ but the extra buttons won't.
D/L the latest (975) drivers from Logitech's page, which basically does the
same as above, you lose the extra button functions. It also plays havoc with
your sensitivity.
