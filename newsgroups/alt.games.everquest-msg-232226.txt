Actually, if he was really a Catholic he'd be moderately polytheistic.
I'm just a Christian and we do the bible thing of praying to the
father in the name of the Son, rather than praying to Mary or some
dead guys. Catholic is what part of the Christian church became,
incorperating Babalonian and other mythos, such as ISIS(Mary) to gain
more worshippers. The funny thing is people stayed with it after it
became ridiculous.

Nah. Lewis did, but Tolkien always said LOTR is not an allegory. Its
not about Christ and the devil, or Hitler, or whatever.
