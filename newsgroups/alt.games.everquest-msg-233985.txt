There are lots of good interfaces there, but for what it's worth, I 
recomend Xymarra's. It comes in a choice of resolutions, and in Melee 
and Caster flavours, and seems to be updated very quickly after patches 
break it.

Having said that, I did go into the XML files and change a few things 
around, like restoring title bars to the chat windows and things like 
that, but hacking XML is not difficult.
