*sigh* I just couldn't stay away from the thread, because:
That "lack of a healing effect" will <never> be evident, because
it is a false statement.  Druid skin buffs do add to total HP as
well as max HP.  However, unlike the Cleric AC/HP line they are
not mana efficient as heals.  Skin buffs give more AC and less HP
than equivalent Cleric buffs.  Hmm, the Protection line of group
Skin buffs might make decent group heals tho, have to check whether
they add to total HP like the single target Skins do.
