Assuming he has dx 8.1 correctly installed, that system should be
running SoL as smooth as butter. (Well, as smooth as *anyone* can run it
in its current state, anyway.) I'm betting on bad drivers there. The
newest drivers available for the GeF 2 MX 400 64 MB were flagged as
"bad" when I researched it prior to installing mine in our two machines
at home. Went with a slightly older set of drivers that were on the
installation CD that came with the cards and it worked fine. You might
suggest that to your guildmate. Other than that we have nearly identical
systems, with his being slightly better in some areas, so he should be
able to get it back in line.
