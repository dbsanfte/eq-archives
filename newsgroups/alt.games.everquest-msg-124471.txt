Ah, but if you were coming from a DnD background that would be opposite 
of what you're used to. DnD AC lower is better so in that train of 
thought his 650 would be better than the 700. I know it and you know it 
and most of the people here know it, but a lot of people could really 
care less about it. My wife likes her druid not because of the ports and 
utility spells.. she likes the fashion aspect. Not everyone is a numbers 
geek. And just because they aren't doesn't necessarily make them a bad 
player - just a different *type* of player.
