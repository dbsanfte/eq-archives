There's no problem at all with asking.  Just don't send a /tell, and be
prepared to accept that people may not want to buff you.

Many times I'll be meeting people in Nexus, and get a /tell within moments
of zoning in.  I typically ignore them.  Most won't ask again.  Sometimes I
get someone that asks a second or even a third time, after waiting 30
seconds or so.

And every once in awhile, I get some selfish clod that will bitch me out
because I didn't immediately respond to their request, or will stand
directly in front of me, as close as they can, maybe thinking that I can't
see them or something.

You might be thinking "what's the harm in just dropping the spell on them". 
The problem is, in the Nexus, you can never cast C3 just once.  As soon as
that "time and space" message gets seen, you get 10 more people asking you
for it.  And this is a spell that takes literally one quarter of my mana to
cast.  Mana that I need for my group.

So I just ignore any requests that come from people I don't know.
