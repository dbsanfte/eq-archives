    There's no way to schedule. We have a "Things Due Up" list with every
target we want to hit and when it's due up. But so does every other guild on
the server. Our Dain mule got a nice screenshot of himself and four other
Dain mules all watching the throne on Monday. It's why I'm bound in The
Nexus now - I can port down and run to anything in Kunark or up to Skyshrine
in Velious, and can run to anything in all of Luclin. As an aside - I love
the layout of Luclin. The fact that I, a cleric with limited Invis
capability and Run Speed One, can get everywhere without anyone babysitting
me has made me really love the expansion.

   ROFL.

> You guys don't have portmules for latecomers?

    Depends how late. I get off work at 6 pm PST, and am online and ready to
go at 7 pm PST. By that point the first mob of the day is dead and they're
usually just relocating somewhere. If it's a ToV day, nobody wants to stop
playing and trying to KS stuff to concentrate on portmuling.

    They have an unlimited-cast Invis item, no charges. If I had one of them
I'd feel a lot better. As it is I feel like I'm rationing out every charge
on my Larrikan's Mask, and my 45 warrior has become nothing more than a Mask
mule for recharging at a vendor.

    Heh, try 960 AC unbuffed. I joined after the armour farming phase, and
because of my late play time I've missed the last two NToV raids. So my
armour is mostly Thurg quest armour, with the odd good piece (like the
Rumblecrush BP and Cazic halo). I'll freely admit that my inexperience at
doing it is what keeps me from doing it, but I've heard enough stories about
buffs (including DA) being dispelled and people having to CR from that
watery hellhole that I'm not interested in practicing.

    Primal is still a huge boost to a melee's damage output because of the
proc. Especially against Luclin mobs, where every ATK point counts.
