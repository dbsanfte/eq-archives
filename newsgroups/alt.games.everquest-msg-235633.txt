Ah but their job choice is not so broad or deep . You really do consign them
to hell when you will not freely allow employers to hire them. Just think
about 5000 applicants lining up for a job at mcDonalds paying 2.25 an hour.
Its not just a sorta ok job, it is better than ANYTHING they could possibly
find elsewhere. Highly qualified scientists, doctors, artists , etc....

I guess im just flawed in that i do not hate non americans enough. I should
want to freely and of my own will pay twice as much for goods and services
so that i can keep those starving indians in their place .

Any agreement of trade for goods or services betwen 2 freely consenting
parties is a GOOD thing. How the socialists howl at that $10 gallon of
gasoline in an emergency. They see only the evil rich guy . They never see
the man who had a fight with his girlfriend got drunk as hell and wakes up
to the blaring evacuation siren. He buys that gallon of gas, and instead of
being a statistic ,gets some of his most treasured belongings and himself
out of harms way. I am far to often the fuck up to so easily dismiss him.
