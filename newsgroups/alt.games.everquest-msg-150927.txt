Several people are suggesting this, and it's tough to come up with a
good argument against it. However, I would still be of the same
opinion. As it is, once I hit level 20 or so, I pretty much expect the
people I group with to have a decent grasp on their class (sure, there
are exceptions). I would hate to have to plug along until 35 or 40
before I could start expecting that as a rule.
