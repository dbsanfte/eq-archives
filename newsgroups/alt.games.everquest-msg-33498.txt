I was bound at befallen entrance and left the dungeon to hunt in W.commons. 3
ghouls made mince meat out of me so i decided to head back to nek forest to
stock up on chips. So i zone into the forest and get jumped by a skeleton, and
notice i am hardly hitting this thing at all and cant see my staff swooshing
across the screen(the amount of times ive melle'd with a fishing rod :P ) it
was then i realised i'd left my body in WC with the ghouls, unlooted...doh!
I also walked from freeport to neriak, im so used to being encumbered i didnt
notice id failed to hit the run button, not to mention the shit iv'e blurted in
guildspeak. EverQuest really, really should not be played while intoxicated,
specially if youre prone to a little trash talking.
Im also guilty of the "My new spells roxxorz, im going to kick the first red
mob i see's ass'......Loading Please wait....
