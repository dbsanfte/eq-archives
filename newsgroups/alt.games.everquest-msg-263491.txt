I thought about what you said Annie.  You're right, it does sound like I 
hate the game.  I am bitter with Sony.  When we were still under NDA we 
would see something on the web site that would get anyone excited, but we 
were playing the game and we knew different.  It irked me to no end.

You're right, no matter what I say, people will still want to try the game. 
As well they should. As for what I want, well, I guess I want people to go 
in with their eyes wide open not looking through Sony colored glasses.

Thanx for the thought Annie
