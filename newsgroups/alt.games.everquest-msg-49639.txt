Hm... I'm using a Mandrake 8 box as a 'net server for a Win2k box. Once I 
got it working (with a lot of help from people here in the NG :), it works 
fine. I'd go as far as to say the performance *appears* to be better than 
when the Windows box dialled up.

IP masquerading, when it works, is pretty transparent. If the HD thrashing 
is on the NT box, I would probably blame it on something going wrong on 
that side. Use the Task Manager to make sure there is nothing else going on 
that may be causing the disk access. Also, make sure your virtual memory 
size is fixed and not dynamic. Most of the unwanted HD access it caused by 
the swap file changing size constantly.
