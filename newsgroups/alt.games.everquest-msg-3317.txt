i may be wrong on this point but if u are under camo a mob will still attack
that has been aggroed to you, if you are hidden the mob wont attack. Im not
sure about the second part but i know for sure that a mob aggroed will still
attack you if u are under cammo, as i found out on my 3rd death monday
evening in BB : )
