Hmmm. I did not see anything in that log that made me think he was a prick. Yes he was offensive but anyone would be that was
accused of cheating by a GM in the middle of a public tournament and then told he was being suspended. He did not use vulgar or
demeaning language and tried to reason with the GM. All the GM had to do to defuse the situation is say there may be a problem with
a bug in the game instead of agitating the player further by becoming offensive himself. I would hope people skills would be a
necessity to be a paid GM but looks like in this case that may not be the case. I would hate to see how any off the posters in this
forum that are defending the GM's actions would respond under the same circumstances.

Hehe some of you guys defending him are the biggest flamers here of people with opposing view points. I would hope the GM was
wearing asbestos underwear if he did it to you. =)
