When the war isnt on though they are easy enough. In a hour or so I picked
up 5 with my monk. Figure another half hour to get there and back and no way
are they worth 1k. They are 2 minute respawns in a cave that has 50 of them?
The only limit to acquiring them is your kill rate and any high melee will
just scythe right through them.

The pattern on the other hand is a bit trickier. You really need a tracker
or a bit of luck , though the runner does seem to hang near the grimling
forest zoneline.
