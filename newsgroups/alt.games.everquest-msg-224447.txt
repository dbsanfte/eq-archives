And I meant to say, you won't be healing the tank so you won't have to 
adjust your heal rate to fit the circumstances.

I did think of something: if a mob -isn't- slowed, isn't slowable, as a 
mage I tend to burn out mana as fast as I can in order to put it on the 
ground.  Since wizards are more capable of this than mages, perhaps 
thats the issue; you want to know because it will directly impact how 
much mana you want to spend on the project?
