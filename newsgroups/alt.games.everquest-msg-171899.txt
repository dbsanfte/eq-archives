Note also that, if you're not totally twinked out, the Concordance of
Research you get for turning in the GLS to Mrysila is a pretty decent
container to keep. It's a 6-slot container that holds *Giant* size items
and weighs less than a backpack. You might want to keep at least one around
for hauling around mammoth tusks when you start fear-kiting mammoths around
Everfrost in a couple levels. And you can always sell it later, when you
need the cash or when you upgrade to a Tailored Backpack or a Rallic pack.

PS. And don't forget picking up an Arena Sack or Tax Collector's Box from
Qeynos for all your forage-spam: 10-slot container that holds Tiny or Small
items (I forget which), weighs almost nothing, and is free!
