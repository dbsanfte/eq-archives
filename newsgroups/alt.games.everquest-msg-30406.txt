This is no longer true.  It was true a long
time ago.  I use it all the time (L40 mage
and a level 20 mage on different servers),
and I can drag it past non-aggro mobs
with complete safety.  As far as I can tell
in 20 some odd days played with a pet,
pets only aggro on a mob that attacks his
master or him.
