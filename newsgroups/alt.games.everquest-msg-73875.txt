I'd be careful, everyone I know who gave away stuff and went to daoc
is now back in EQ wanting their stuff back or help to get more stuff
;) What they found is that DAOC is a far more limited game where:

1) you level faster basically

2) gear, for the most part, is not as uber and is cheaper since
you more or less feed a smith in your guild to continually upgrade
your gear which is fine since for the most part in daoc you are fine
in player made good armor. You do have to upgrade it as you level
though and can use a higher grade.

3) there is, of course, less content since EQ has been getting new
content for 2 and a half years and now with Luclin has a STAGGERING
amount. 

4) when you reach top level, due to 1 and 2, the only thing left for
you is realm pvp for the most part. Tell me exactly how long that
keeps you entertained please before it gets very boring.

See the problem as I see it is that EQ and DAOC are like bipolar
opposites but neither one is really desirable to me. I want something
in the middle. I love the content and variety of EQ and aspiring to
get more uber cool stuff while I like the idea of player made
continually upgraded armor that decays being "more than good enough"
as with DAOC. 

I like the idea of the accelerated play in DAOC but here is the rub,
in EQ after 2 years or so I'm level 55 on my main character.. nearly
level 56. The thing is it took me a LONG TIME to go from 51 to 55..
basically most of my characters life, believe it or not. This means
that at my rate I have a LONG TIME to go until 60. So in EQ besides
getting more stuff my druid's current goal is gradually leveling to
60. What happens when I'm 60 and have the best stuff for my class (I
already got my epic at 55.. finally ;)  ) ? More than likely I won't
feel like doing it on another char and possibly retire. Meanwhile in a
FRACTION of that time I would have reached max level in DAOC and
really had nothing to do but realm pvp which does not appeal to me
much, I mean I'd have great player made stuff at max level
supplemented by great quest retrieved items so what would be the
attraction of getting realm points? Last I heard they don't even have
the system set up where you can exchange the realm points for stuff. 

The thing is though guess what will be coming out BEFORE I get to 60
even? Thats right.. a lil thing called "Star Wars Galaxies." Partially
through upgrading for Luclin I think I'll have more than a good enough
system to run it when its out also. More than likely I'll jump into it
because Verant are frankly the kings of content. Reading its faq, well
and even from stuff you see them putting in Luclin, they've learned
their lesson about what players want while they still don't want to
give them everything to fast like DAOC does.


>check out the movies of actual gameplay on gamespot. Don't believe me,
>believe your own eyes.

Unfortunately movies are not really worth much. I could show you
movies of EQ with the new luclin models (if I bothered to make some)
that ruled all. 

From what I'm hearing from people returning to EQ, DAOC was a great
try and far better than Anarchy Online but it still misses.
