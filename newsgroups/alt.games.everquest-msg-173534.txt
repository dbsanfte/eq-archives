No. Wrong, fatally wrong, the sort of wrong that guarantees you will
face more terrorism. The US is hated for political and economic
reasons. The religious one is tertiary.

You have to learn, understand, and fix that problem first. Well,
concurrently, at least, if not first.

Iraq is not a religiously extremist-ruled state. I despise religious
extremists too. No one shed a tear for the Taliban. But Iraq has spent
most of the last twenty years *fighting* the friends of the Taliban.

Bin Laden hated the US for political reasons; namely its interference
in Saudi Arabia and other puppet states. For him religion was again
secondary.

They attacked the US because they had to attack somebody? Get real.
Get *informed*.

Since you bring it up, I think some interesting parallels could be
drawn up between what the US is doing now and the Fourth Crusade. War
for plunder and profit under the guise of religious righteousness, and
against a target that doesn't even fit the profile.

Yes... interesting how history repeats itself. Byzantine fell, as Iraq
will fall. But Venice declined into decadence and crumbled as well.
