Just took a look at Sigil's page today, due to EQII.com mentioning the new
talent they had hired.  Followed the links of the artists they are hiring
and realized that I recognized a LOT of these folks.  Obviously I knew
Keith Parkinson, but...damn! Brom! And those Other GUys whose work I've
seen all the time. And T. King! They have f***ing T King doing their
UI.  

I'm scared of them now. Is it normal for MMORPG creators to hire THIS MUCH
artistic talent just to doodle for their games? I thought, ok, so who
gives a flip about hiring some big name talent...so many games have
promised so much and flopped, why would they be any different?

Then I thought about why most games flop...because they run out of funding
and time.

But Sigil has Microsoft behind them for funding.

Yes, indeed, Sigil is scaring me. It's like watching huges boxes being
delivered to your neighbor day after day, and hearing banging noises over
there, and no having a clue what they are building.
