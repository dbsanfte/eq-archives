This guy is harassing you. There is a whole class of men
(and it pains me to say this about my own gender) who prey
on women who are too "nice" to tell them to get lost. A subclass of
these men are those who have imaginary relationships with all of
the women they know. Yes, this happens in real-life as well as
online life. I know a woman in real-life who is dealing with this
problem right now. Fortunately, in EQ you have some options.

/ignore - Just don't talk to the guy any more. If you MUST be
nice to feel less mean about doing it then tell him you "need some distance"
for a while and then DON'T give him an opportunity to start asking
"why?". He'll know exactly why, even if he doesn't want to admit it.
Hit /ignore right then and get on with your life.

Now, the first thing this guy will do is make an alt and start up with
"why are you being so mean to me?", like he just doesn't get it. At
that point, you tell him that if he can't leave you alone that you are
going to report him. Then, DON'T WAIT! Hit /report, followed by
"/petition Player X, also using the name Y, won't stop harassing me.
I have filed a report showing that I've asked him to stop."
When a guide or GM shows up to investigate, tell them exactly
what's been going on and exactly what the loser has been doing
since then.

Be proactive, not reactive. Show the guy you mean business and
he'll eventually leave you alone. Remember, this is pretend life
(which is part of why the jerk is bold enough to harass you this way).
If you normally avoid confrontation, then ask yourself what YOUR
CHARACTER would do, and ROLEPLAY if that's what it takes
to get the nerve up to blow the guy off.

The important thing is to take control. Right now, you're letting
this guy control the situation because you either enjoy the feeling
of someone wanting you sexually/emotionally or you are feeling
too timid to rock the boat. Figure out which it is and take the
appropriate action. NOTE: Letting it continue is NOT the appropriate
action.

By the way, if you're in a guild then I'd also recommend letting
the guild know about this low-life. You'll probably find the moral
support from them that you might be feeling you need in order to
justify "being  mean" to the guy. You have to realize that he is being
a lot meaner to you with his unwanted advances than you are going
to be with him. Take control. As long as you let him continue, you
are giving him power over your life and letting yourself be a victim.
No-one should be a victim, but a person who knowingly lets
someone else victimize them deserves what they get in the end.
Stand up for yourself and you'll feel better in the long run.
