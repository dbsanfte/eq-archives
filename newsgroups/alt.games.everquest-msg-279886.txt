It's been many months since I looked at the enchanters spell list but
it seems to me that it was the same for chanters, any maybe for all
the classes.  All that was happening 66-70 was that my spells were
being upgraded so they were "level-appropriate".  For example, instead
of mez being capped at 65, I could mez stuff that was level 68.  Does
any class get any startling new abilities in the 66-70 range??
