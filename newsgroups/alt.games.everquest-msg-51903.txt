    Personally, there was only one time that I asked for -help-... It wasn't
power levelling, and I was grouped with the two that were assisting me in
levelling...  And the only reason I even -asked- for help was because we are
planning a guild mid-level raid to the Warrens, and I wanted to reach lev 29
so that I could offer ports to those in our guild who would need them.. :)
