Strike three! Hard to believe someone doesn't even check my posting history.
I've never dumped on anyone for petitioning a name. I could give a shit.

Because you have obviously mistaken me for the other Richard in the
newsgroup. Go buy a clue: I'm the one that has been around the gaming
newsgroups for dozen years or so, always have had my email as ricortes@ for
that entire time.

Do you need another explaination of Lytz B'Doff or do you have a handle on
that one now?

I'm sorry I asked for another stupid post by you, it was really unnecessary.
You have my permission to skip making another stupid post or even an apology
for your mistake. Once again, I am aware of context. Your post was not
directed at me ergo no intent to offend and none taken.
