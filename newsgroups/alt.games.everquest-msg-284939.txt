SOE changed the way the face appeared when under illusion.  It was to
kill an old but useless exploit of haing the face box open before
doing illusion in order to change the illusioned forms.  Not sure if
that altered the way the illusion appearance affected you but since
it's under illusion there's not much you can do anyway.
