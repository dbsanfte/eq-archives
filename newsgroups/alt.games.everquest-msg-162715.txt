Hasten is an annoying little bugger.  Holding him in place to do the handin is
irritating enough, without messing around with a cash transaction at the crucial
point.

MQing is a matter of trust.  If you are unable to trust someone to pay up after
doing the MQ, then why should they trust you to do it?  Either get money in
advance or afterwards, don't try to get it while in the middle of the operation.

Why not?   Camping him takes just as long as ever, and there's no vendor buyable
option thats better for less.  I'm surprised its valued as low as TBoots, when
the only advantage to TBoots is you don't have to do the quest, while JBoots are
better in many significant ways; well, one, they are instant click.  This means
several things though: one, it takes less casting time which you could be using
for other things (not a big deal);  two, it can't ever be interupted (better);
and three, this means its excellent for use in blocking the dispelling effect of
dragons and the like, something you'll be using long after you get Run 3.

TBoots are fine for the purpose of making you faster than outdoor mobs if used
with care and not dispelled, and even for making you faster than indoor mobs for
a while after you zone in.  But they are worlds less useful than JBoots.  So
what are you suggesting as a substitute for JBoots that costs less?
