}The message means exactly that. There is no functioning 3D hardware in
}your computer that the EQ program can detect. This is not a directx9
}problem nor a driver problem (I think). It has something to do with
}your card and how it is functioning.
}Best bet might be to try and play another 3D game and see if IT can
}run. If it does then maybe the EQ execute or DLL files are hosed. If
}not, then you might move the card to another computer and see if it
}works there (or remove and reinstall to make sure you get good
}contacts).
}If it can't work at all in any 3D game, then it probably needs to be
}replaced.

Every once in a while I have a problem like this, and I end up calling 
dad.  Dad is a great resource...  Every time I can't get my car to start, 
and I think I've wiggled everything wiggleable, and I'm at my wit's end, I 
call dad, who says, "did you try thoroughly cleaning the battery terminals 
and putting some vaseline on them before you clamp the cables back down?"  
And I smack myself in the forehead, because that's exactly what he said 
the last six times I couldn't start my car, and it works every blinking 
time.

But here we need the computer variation.  Periodically, I call dad, and 
say, "Such and such a card isn't working!  It's like the computer only 
knows it's there under certain circumstances, or something!"  And sure 
enough, dad says, "did you take the card out and clean the contacts with 
a rubber eraser before putting it back in?"  And sure enough, that 
frequently fixes it.

So you might wanna try that.
