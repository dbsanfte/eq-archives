Ratio isn't everything.
A 17 delay weapon would give you pretty decent damage even with a
shitty ratio due to the min damage modifier.

It's called primal velium <whatever>.
1H weapons are 13/20 ratio, +5 to all stats (at least all stats
meaningful to those who can weild it), and +5 to all saves.  Procs
Avatar which is a +100 ATK/STR/AGI/DEX buff (of course, since after
the first proc, your Dex is in the 255 range, it'll continue to proc
and proc and proc and proc...)

2H weapons have a ratio of 33/35 (same stats at the 1H weapons).

BTW, the warrior epic's ratios are actually pretty shitty.
