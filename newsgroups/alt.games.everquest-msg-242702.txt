You can look here http://tinyurl.com/2tltx to see where the book of
dark bindings is sold. Gunthak elven mage will only give you the
updated book when your research skill is over 100.

Buy a Geerlok Automated Quill, it will give you a 5% bonus on your
research skill. I've seen them priced from 100pp to 500pp in the
bazaar but if you are going to do a lot of research it will be a
benefit.
