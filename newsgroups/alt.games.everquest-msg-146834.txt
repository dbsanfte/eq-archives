I've been in dawnshroud for some time now as well, probably since 34 or 35 and 
I'm level 43 now. The zelniaks are easy game as they don't get agro and don't 
assist each other. As a druid I also didn't need to deal with the wolves, which 
if you're unprepared can cause problems if they attack and gang up. I'm still 
soloing there for one more level until 44, quadding the large zelniaks gives 
about 4-5% per quad.
