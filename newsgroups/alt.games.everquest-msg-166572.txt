No offense, but that's a terrible idea.

I used to run a BBS ten or twelve years ago.  I had a few games on it that
people could play.  And one rule that I discovered was that if you give
people the freedom to do something, most people will not abuse it, but there
is a very small percentage that will, and that small percentage will ruin
things for everyone else, just because they can.

I've incorporated this into my programming skillset by asking myself "what's
the worst thing someone could use this feature to do?" and then using the
answer to that question to decide whether to implement it and how.

What's the worst thing that someone could do with duplicate names?

Ruin other people's reputations.  Go into a zone and spam it all to hell. 
Rip people off in trades.  Train.  KS.  Etc.  You get the idea.

Why would someone do this?  Because they can.  Because that person didn't
run across the zone to sow them.  Because that person wouldn't give them
that cool weapon they were wielding.  Because that person wouldn't give them
some plat to buy their spells.  Or just because they think it's fun.  And
yes, there are people in the game that would do this.

Names really aren't that much trouble to come up with.  Even good names
aren't that hard to find. I've never had any trouble coming up with them. 

The trick is to not get too attached to the name beforehand, and if it gets
rejected, be willing to really change it to something else instead of
tacking an E on the end or sticking an extra repeated letter into it.  Those
just make you look like someone that can't spell.
