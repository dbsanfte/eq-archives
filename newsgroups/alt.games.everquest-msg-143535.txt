    Our guild has one serious, level 60 raiding BST. We have two people who
are extremely part-time that have mid-50's BSTs. Our guild is huge because
of all the part-time folks. Our main competition has exactly one BST. FoH
has exactly one BST. Trust me, BSTs are not a "must get" class for a raiding
guild. Reasons?

(1) One BST can handle giving out the one buff, SP, that they have that
people want. Savagery would be nice, but because they pre-nerfed it like
they did Avatar there's no point in having extra BSTs around to apply it.
(2) BST damage doesn't scale up well. With pet, they can deal damage almost
on a par with a monk; without pet, like a knight class. Pets aren't always
allowed. Furthermore, as the game progresses and better and better weapons
are found, the BSTs damage output will trail off compared with others
because they only get some of their damage from weapons. Other classses that
melee will gain full advantage from those weapons.
(3) Since the class is new, any BST you want to recruit will have to be
geared up. Since Velious BST quest armour is crap, as is Kunark armour, and
since they cast and melee both a fair bit (they actually use the priest
class AA titles), that means diverting a lot of all/all gear (usually) with
good overall stats to them AND monk weapons that would do more damage if on
a monk. Guilds are unlikely to make that large an investment without seeing
some future return coming from it.
