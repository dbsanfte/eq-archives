your an idiot there zibro. the clock speeds are way different and on top of
it all there are different cache systems on the intel and amds.... what a
goon.  for the guy that asked the question you will be fine and let no one
tell ya different.  for those who think the amd is less of a processor then
the intel... i would rather care an amd that will not die on me then paying
way to much for a piece of heated up metal.... i don't need another heater
in my computer room.
