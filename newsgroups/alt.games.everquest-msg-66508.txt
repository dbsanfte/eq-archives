Hey guys,

Recently moved my board up to 512MB of ram from 128MB.  There was a
tremendous benefit in zone times and exiting the game.  This was pre-luclin.

Any experience from anyone who has noticed a similar benefit (POST-luclin)
going from 512MB to 1.0GB?  Hell, for the 90 bucks it would cost to max out
my board, I'd do it - if it saved a little time now and then.

Best,

Bryce
