You could practice tailoring (you'll need it anyway for your robe
quest)and make or buy a Cured Silk Gi, or go to Dalnir's Tomb and pick
up a Crescent Gi (No Drop), or go to Plane of Fear (if you're high
enough) and get a Shiver-Back Tunic. There's also another tunic
dropped by a rare named mob in Rathe Mts that has the same graphic.
