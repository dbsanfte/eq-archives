They had three "tanks".
You telling me he couldn't keep up with three tank's worth of
hitpoints?

The concept of turgur being resisted is in the game from the start.
This isn't a major change (it's gimpy I agree, but it's not that big
of a shock).  The problem is complete heal.

Because you have an unresistable complete heal combined with tanks
bordering on 6000hps, you *HAVE* to design encounters to account for
this level of mana efficiency.

I will go so far as to say if they never put complete heal into the
game, we would never have Velious mobs with 200khps and over 3400hps
of damage per combat round.

No, it comes from what most folks consider boss mobs.

Dain - boss mob of Icewell.  Can't be slowed.
Tormax - boss of Kael.  Can't be slowed.
Yelinak - boss of Skyshrine.  Can't be slowed.
Lendiniara - boss of ToV West wing.  Can't be slowed.
Avatar of War - boss of the boss, can't be slowed.
Vulrak - boss of ToV North, can't be slowed.
etc...

> If it's
>slowable, it's a "gimp". If it isn't, it's a "boss mob". 

Not neccessarily.
Plenty of non-boss mobs in the game that's unslowable.  Velketor,
unslowable--hardly a boss mob encounter.  Sontalak, unslowable again
not a boss mob (annoying as fuck but not a boss).  The list goes on
and on and on...
