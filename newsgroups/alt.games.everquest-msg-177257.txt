I think you have a point, I remember how much fun it was to find distant
places in EQ with my first character.  After, however, a few long boats
rides and waits, sitting on my rear end waiting for the port spires to
activate, and making that long run across West Karana to get to Qeynos, the
hassles of traveling became a major detraction for me.  For most people,
those portal stones are a welcome addition.
