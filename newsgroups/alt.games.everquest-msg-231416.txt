Actually, Tolkien was so very pro enviornment and pro trees that if he
was a man of 40 or 50 today he'd probably embrace computers and then
use them for all of his writing. He loved trees and nature in general,
hating the industrial wasteland of man. You can kind of see that theme
throughout Lord of the Rings. The way that Frodo grew up was the way
that Tolkien himself grew up, later having to move to the city.

He was only old fashioned due to progress back then being so
industrial. It was all factories belching out pollution, forests being
cut down, cities being overcrowded, etc. We still have those kinds but
we have added computer based progress which is cleaner overall (except
for then dumping old used ones along with their printers in
landfills..)

He might be very supportive of an online game where people go out
questing and such.

William Gibson rocks. Its too bad none of his works have been made
into good movies. I remember reading Neuromancer when it first came
out. Its description of computers back then was insane, the power that
they had. The funny thing is tons of those things have come to pass,
except for actually "jacking in".
