I'm assuming you have Win2k Pro as your OS.

You've received a couple of replies...yup, Win2k+Live! = crappy sound if you
want 3d sound (well duh, of course you do).  Someone else posted that they
thought an update was out.

I have the Live! Value at work & just checked MS's Windows Update site and
it's not there.

When I went to www.creative.com and chose drivers, and highlighted Win2000,
Live! Family, I received a couple of files, but nothing new.

When I did Win2000 & Live! 5.1 there were NO files.

Further, WinXP drivers are listed to come out mid-late October, though
someone else posted that THOSE files could be found on the Windows Update
screen if you are running WinXP and you go there.  I can't verify that.
