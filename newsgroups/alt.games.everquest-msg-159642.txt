The new transportation system alone is worth it.  I only have one character
that is at all port capable, and self ports only at that.  The rest had to
either find a druid/wizard, or run a long ways.  I'm also not convinced that
the average player isn't 46+ at this point in time, but, as I said, the
transport system alone is worth it for us nonporting types.  Even for
porters, it offers more destinations, and mana free.
