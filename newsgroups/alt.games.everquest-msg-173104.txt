What happened to us the first time was halfway through the fight, a Black
Reavers just popped on top of us for no apparent reason.  It should not have
spawned, we had over an hour to go until the respawn.  He was killed, and
another popped, it got ugly fast.  The second time, the mage pets just would
not live long enough to be useful.  They were the 49 fire pets, as
recommended, the mages both had FR way below 100 so that the pets were
supposed to be immune to fire, did not work.  The fight was taking a long
time, we got a repop of some mobs, they joined in to help.

The last time we did it with the MA and SA only fighting Rak, did it twice
in a row.  It was a trivial encounter.  I was recommending 60+. but you can
certainly go lower on the two tanks fighting him, just be sure they have
very high buffed FR, and, the lower they are, the more healers you will
need.  If they are much under 60, I would definately consider doing it with
a CHeal rotation, with 3 or 4 healers per, but it should be quite doable.  I
am just quite gunshy of doing it with the mage pets ever again.
