    Wow.  I only play female characters, and always have.  I don't have
anything against guys, of course, but I'm happy being a woman, online
and off.  Also I'm not a lesbian, but I do have zero interest in
flirting with some_random_horndog, either in-game or out.  If you ain't
Lenny the Ogre who lives in my house, then I don't have the slightest
interest in even pretending to have a sexual relationship, however how
mild, with you.

   That said, I've not had any experiences like you describe.  I've had
random gifts given to me, of course, but have not been stalked for
taking them.  If some guy does start to flirt with me, I find a way to
mention my  (ogre) husband, and they usually back off.  I can only think
of two times sexual innuendo when beyond that.  One, I was sitting in a
fairly safe spot somewhere in the forest, medding to get my mana back. 
A woodelf comes up to me, and says hi.  I say hi back.  Then he starts
chain hitting /dance in front of me, while taking his chest armor on and
off.  I actually thought this was pretty funny, though I didn't say
anything else to him, and he eventually went away.  The other time was
more annoying.  It was right after I moved to FV.  A guy comes up and
starts to flirt with me in pseudo- middle English.  He's calling me
"Honey", and like Ryou, I hate, hate, hate being called that (except for
by Lenny).  I archly tell the guy that I am not named "Honey", and I
have no need of compliments from the likes of him (note, I am a high
elf).  He tells me then that I should get a clue, this is a roleplaying
server and I should stop being so stuck up.  I guess that he expects
High Elves to roleplay as flirtatious little whores, rather than aloof
ladies of the Realm.  He gets rather nasty in his insults.  It didn't
take long for me to /ignore him.  

Maybe I would have had more stories like this, I dunno.  I tend to
auto-ignore (not using the game command) guys that start hitting on me
in game.  What really annoys me, though, is when I see some female
woodelf character named "Sweetycakes", baby talking near a bank or
entrance to a city.  I like to think they are shims.  Most RL women I
know _don't_ solicit this sort of behavior.  Course, the ones I hang out
with, then to be a little bit older than what I imagine the mean age of
the EQ population is.
