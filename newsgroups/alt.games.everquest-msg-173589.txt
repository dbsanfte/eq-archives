No, not really.  For me, pets never last more than one or two fights
anyway.  After my pet has killed one, I usually make the next pull my
new pet.  He finishes off the old pet easily, but takes enough damage
that my NEXT pet can finish him off easily.

Most people have.  That doesn't make pulling an unannounced train to
the GY any less inconsiderate.

There will also be clerics in the process of rezing people.  People
looting their bodies.  People who have JUST been rezed in and can't
take one hit off a planar mob.  Lots of legitimate reasons for
somebody to be standing around the GY.

Ninety percent of the bitching would be stopped if people would just
learn to call the fucking train, and to path it in such a way to keep
it as far away from people zoning in as possible.  I realize in some
zones, like PoI, this is impossible, but in PoN one can easily bring
the train in at such an angle as to keep it away from people in the
GY.

Nitpick, not SoW, SoE.  :-)

But anyway, Form of the Howler is faster than SoE, gives 2 mana per
tick, and lasts two and a half times as long.  The disadvantage of it
dropping when I Egress is outweighed by the advantages, IMO.  But
that's just me.
