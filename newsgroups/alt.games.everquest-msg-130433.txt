Sorry, but I get to decide what I think is rude or not, not you.  If you
send me an unsolicited tell asking for some service, I'm already less
inclined to help you than if you'd advertised publicly for it.  Rage against
it all you want, but that's the way it's going to work.  You'd be better off
considering what other people consider polite when you're the one asking for
favors.
