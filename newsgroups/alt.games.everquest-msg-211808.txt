My enchanter is 64, my mage 61.

I have no complaints about the mage at all.  You are sorely mistaken if you
think that most sensible casters already have permanent focus items.  Maybe
uberguilds, but the rest of us schmoes (the other 95%+...DO try to remember
them) have to deal with what is available to us.  Don't even talk about
buying stuff...we're still saving up to buy the spells the ubers are selling
for 10-20x more than they should.

Modrods at 64 are still handy.  I've got ornate boots on my enchanter (spell
casting haste), but I still get a boom bracelet from my mage.  In my guild
of 70+ active members (people), 20 of whom are 65, 40+ more whom are 60-64,
my mage still passes focus items out to almost every caster (some hybrids
even want them, though I don't know why).  Why is it necessary?  Because
we're not an uberguild.  We're not even a Raid Guild (and have no desire to
be).

Mages are one hell of a good support class when it comes to casters.

Crowd control.  Well, rogues have no CC or single-pull abilities either...so
they suck too?  Besides, you're wrong when you say they have no CC.  An
earth pet roots ALL the freaking time.  Sic him on an add and back off and
you're gtg.  Let's see a monk do that.

Mages are one hell of an offensive class as well, but hopefully that goes
without saying.
