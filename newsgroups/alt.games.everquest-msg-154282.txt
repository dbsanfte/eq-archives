The loot of an event which upgrades "a small group of friendly people" would
not be an upgrade for resident_uberguild_member01

You kill a mob first for the challenge and achievement.  Then you kill it
for loot, to better yourself and your guild.  Nothing more.

If the loot is "crap" to them, they won't farm it.. it would be a waste of
their time
