My two main caster characters were a druid and an enchanter. In both
cases I carefully managed my mana so that I would be maintaining a
constant rate in and out according to the speed of the pulls (not to
toot my own horn or anything but I was very good at both. :-) ). This
means I almost *never* ran out of mana, unless shit hit the fan, and
my groups never ever had downtime in pulling where people needed to
wait for mana on regular pulls; I couldn't stand that.

So, that said, people almost never heard me say oom. But when I did,
it was a major deal. Most regular pulls wouldn't put me lower than 80,
which was my target mana I tried to maintain. So the *very* rare cases
when I started getting down below 30, I would start warning the group
"running low" during the fight. I would do this about three times if
mana continued to go down. The fourth time wasn't so simple. That was
hotkey time, to get attention.

-------->>> OUT OF MANA <<<--------

Since this would only ever happen in extremely rough fights that have
gone overly long, it was important they knew I was no longer able to
function quickly. 

This is a single group thing, btw, I rarely bothered with it on raids
where I am expected to use all my mana. Just in heavy regular
situations.

That was the sort of situation that happened only a couple times a
month, though.
