On another note, i hear rangers are next for the nerf, according to
www.mobhunter.com. What's the bets on the next on line? Shaman's slow
nerfed, druid harmony nerfed, druid plat for port nerfed, monks just nerfed
nerfed nerfed (although it has been pointed out that a naked monk is more
powerful than a naked character of most other classes, but the advantage of
that, except on the Plane of Skinny-Dipping, escapes me), and clerics and
warriors beefed up.

I forgot the beastlord pet nerf.

Hmmm... they could always make it so bards can't twist songs?


I think the reason the monk nerf made me so mad was that I played the
character because i wanted someone who could solo and hit things, and sony
deciding soloing (or duoing) is bad, m'kay, so every group has to have a
tank, and a healer, before a monk can fight anything, unless monk is wearing
ubergear, at which point they can go back to soloing and getting even more
ubergear.
