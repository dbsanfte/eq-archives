I see and understand your point... but try to see where I am coming
from.  
I can solo guk to get the items I want.  I could solo there at the
appropreiat level (with a little caution).  I did not have to drag a
group to a particular dungeon just for me.  Yes, I on occasion brought
a friend or two, but I did not have the NEED to bring a full group.
LDoN, does not allow for me to go solo, much less a group of 3 would
have some issues in LDoN.  Not so much issues staying alive, but
getting the kill count / drops in the alloted time.

Again, I see and understand you.  I also have never dragged people to
any specific encounters except my epic mobs.  All other camps I had
interest in, I would attempt solo, or with a nominal group.  On
occasion with a full group, but that would be due to there were
various drops within the zone for all the peeps in the group.

LDoN, seperates what people want in specific camps.   At the higher
end, gear is aroudn 1400 points.  now, I want to hunt with guildies,
but we both need the alloted 1400 points, but in different camps.
Conflict of intrest.   My stance is, just go where they need to go....
get them through.  Its easier to get a group in Everfrost than there
is for the  Takish camps.   On Quellious its like pulling teeth to get
anyone do do adventures other than BB, and EF.

its just a bitch, no biggie, Id like to have fun and spen my points
where I wish, so I can continue to have fun.  I dont look forward to
any grind / time sink.  and I feel the split of points has created a
time sink to one individual or another.
