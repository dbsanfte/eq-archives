Old versions of the files that they've since patched ten times. I also 
had the GoD thing checked in the patcher and pre-ordered online. Came 
home yesterday, fired up that patcher, had maybe a two minute patch 
(cable modem) and logged straight in to a GoD ready account. I'm 
pleasantly SHOCKED to see it work that smoothly considering who provided 
it to me.
