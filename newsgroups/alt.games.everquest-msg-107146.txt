Dont forget the enchanters who dont want to be your buf bitches. Last night
for example at the zone in to kc...

Idiot001: Are you near KC
Me: *looks up idiot001 and notes they are a complete stranger*
Me: Why
Idiot001: I need a fresh charge of crack if u can spare
Me: /ignore idiot001

or alternatively in sebilis last night....

Idiot002: Can I get haste please
Me: Sorry, im sstruggling for mana, and my group comes first
Idiot002: I can wait
Me: You might be waiting a long time
Idiot002: Then use the low level haste, it only costs 10 mana right?
Me: And are you donating for me messing about?
Idiot002: Im on a corpse run, is this asking too much?
Me: Oh ok, sorry but u didnt mention that.
Me: *casts augmentation on idiot002*
Idiot002: I think that was rather uncalled for. blah blah blah
Me: I cast the buf, you got what you wanted.
Idiot002: Now im gonna die getting my corpse because you couldnt spare the
mana for an invis
Me: I never saw you ask for invis, I guess it got lost in the spam
    (yes im busy mezzing etc while this wasted converssation happens)
Idiot002 proceeds to whuine some more.
/ignore idiot002

Maybe im throwing out the baby with the bathwater, but these idiots arnt
going to force me into anon.
