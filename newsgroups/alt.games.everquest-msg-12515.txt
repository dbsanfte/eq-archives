Neither does your shaman, that's the point I'm trying to get across.  Your
shaman solos by slowing them down.

No, seriously, what if slow doesn't stick, period.

Depends on the MOB, the ones that can knock out a fully buffed int caster
in one round will also wipe the floor with a shaman

Ok, the shaman is dead, or even if you think slow=tanking, OOM, tell me how 
he can tank better than a warrior.

Absolutely untrue.  First, VS can take down those runes in 2 rounds, so
warriors, with their higher AC, and most importantly higher dodge/parry/
riposte skills, tanks better than a shaman of any level.

All I have been saying is that statement is meaningless, your definition of 
shaman tanking relies on spell casting, which is increasingly unreliable
near the end game.
