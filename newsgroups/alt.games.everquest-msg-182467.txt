Hi there!

Ehm! What about The Warrens? Yes i know it's only 4-25 lvl mobs but then you
could fight your way towards Stonebrunt Mountains. SM is actually a great
zone! You should be able to hunt there for maaany seasons! He he! My self a
lvl 51 ranger still visits this zone looking for titans to spawn.... And
they are great to quest for pp's!!

Happy hunting!

Ronald
