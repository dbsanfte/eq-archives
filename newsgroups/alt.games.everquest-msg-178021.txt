No it wasn't.  I'm on Drinal.  But just for laughs, the next night I went
into KC and announced "Bard lfg" and what happens?
Completeasshole invites you to join a group.
I joined fully expecting these him to give me shit, especially when I saw
the other names in the group.  No-one mentioned a thing.  We managed even
though it was a horrible group.  I think they are mainly pick-up players,
like myself, but some of them didn't have a clue.
We did OK, though but eventually I had to log.  I sat in KC's entrance in DL
chatting with a buddy before I log when the group comes piling out almost
dead.
I think they really just needed a bard.  Because bards are beautiful.

Sean...
