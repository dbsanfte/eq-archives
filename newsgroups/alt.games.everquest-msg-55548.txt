Hey, missed this the first time around, maybe I've rezzed you in EK? =)
Saw that moron offering the Wurmy and the Paw too, my pally friend got
real mad when he heard it... Kinda sad to see stuff like that happening.

Of course, the same pally didn't refuse the netted kelp tunic he got
from a monk who got to loot the monk tunic off of KeVagon... ;)

(For the record, the monk didn't offer us the tunic until AFTER he
had looted the new one)

Apologies to all PALADINS who hate to hear pally =D
