Your story really make me angry.  I am not familiar with that area but
will make it there tonight to see the zone.  Sounds to me like the
spiders are like the Aviak trees in SK or TD.  Are you a warrior
soloing?  Are you saying you have no spells that could cause a little
havoc, if not you need some allies and you should bite the bullet and
make some friends.

You also need to stop being a nice guy.  That other group went to bed
happy and content with there bellies full of exp. Next time get out
your little bow and arrow and smack two or three spiders bring them
over to the group and what ever is left is yours.

hopefully you can get a /report of your meele, charm message and the,
"what you gonna do about it" message.  That might help you and get the
heat turned on this guy.  A daily report  and petition sent should be
enough to get someones attention.
