Your attack will vary based on your skill at the specific type of weapon
you are weilding.  As a bard, you can use HtH, 1hs, 1hb, and piercing.
Unless your skill at all of the above is identicle, you should not see the
same jump in attack when comparing to each of the above...

When  holding an instrument in off hand, your attack is based on your
HtH (notice that Primary slot is empty)

I'm not sure how Attack is calculated when you have one of the
primary equippable instruments in primary hand, since AFAIK they
do not display the secondary slot attack... but perhaps thats
what they do, this will be easy to check.

At any rate, I say "you should not see" but I mean "if this is based on
your different skills as I and Briarroot both suspect.

What I -think- is happening is that you have a decent 1hs skill, and
are comparing your HtH, 1hb, and piercing skills versus 1hs skill
in terms of generating your attack value.

Also used in determining this are Offence and a few buffs, but those
shouldn't change based on what you equip.

If you specifically have a 1Hs in primary, secondary empty (get
a rusty broadsword to try this with if you don't have one) and then
swap in the JBOM and see that same jump, we'll have to try
to confirm with other players.  Might be a glitch to your character
(I've seen similar things) but it might be something real that noone
has noticed prior to this... bug or not there would be quite a jump
in the value of the JBOM untill its fix.
