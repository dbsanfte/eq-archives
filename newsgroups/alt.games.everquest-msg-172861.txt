Ian

Well, have fun with EQ.   Have a good look on the sites on the web
about classes and the various skills and things.   It is these parts
of EQ which makes the game very satisfying.

For my last character I decided to try a gnome mage because I wanted
to learn to tinker (a skill exclusively for gnomes).

Also having a good server helps and if you get into a guild a good
guild is worth its weight in gold.

Regards
  Malc
