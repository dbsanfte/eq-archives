yep, all true. The thing is though the group you need for the named
watchers is going to be pretty gosh darn buff and probably comprised
of level 55 to 60's and at least need a monk puller, doubt if even an
sk puller would cut it for that. You really might even need 2 groups.

Yeah, the people I've seen doing it are people who do the giant armor
quests from TOV drops anyway. Some of them have the armor on and they
all log out their twinks also for particular pieces. The thing is its
kind of aggrivating though because they have other people's twinks or
mains there pestering them about drops. Many of them take to actually
destroying the common drops they already have like boots, bracers and
such so that the outsiders don't hang around. Might seem a bit mean
but its to prevent an outsider from looting a bp or legs before one of
their characters can, makes sense really.

I'd LOVE to try and raid this for my twink but all she'd need is the
bp and legs and my guild does skyshrine armor quests from TOV and many
people in it seem to want the stupid dain ring so never have the
people for doing icewell.
