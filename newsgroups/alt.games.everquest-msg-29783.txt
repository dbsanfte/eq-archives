I was going to post a reminder on the dangers of soloing so much that you
don't learn good group tactics, nor meet people who will want to group with
you later on, and invite you along on the fun things later in the game...  but
after reading this post, I think I'll save myself the effort and say "Enjoy
level sixty, after spending your 10 billionth hour soloing in Skyfire.  Hope
you have fun doing that."
