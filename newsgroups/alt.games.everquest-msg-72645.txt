my suggestion is if your friends are getting DAOC and you have EQ, have your
friends try out EQ and you can try out DAOC, then you can all decide which
one you prefer.  With SOL out, I think that the graphics have been seriously
updated in EQ.

and with regard to EQ being put to pasture, I don't think that is going to
happen any time soon.  They just came out with a update to EQ; I don't think
MMORPGs are ever put out to pasture unless the company suppporting them
somehow goes belly up.

Look at Gemstone 3, they wanted to revamp the whole system, but really
couldn't.  They had  to make a new game to put in their new system;
Dragonrealms.  Gemstone 3 is still around and kicking, and after how many
years.

Even with EQ 2 coming out, EQ will still be around.
