I'm embarrassed to admit it, but I understood it perfectly. I'm just
wondering which NG it was aimed at, because it showing in a.g.e puts
me in mind of a drunken dart player.

What he was saying is that he uses an email address to collect spam so
he can backlist the senders for addresses he really reads. His
provider started using some common filters to get rid of spam, so he
wasn't seeing it for a while, until his junk mailbox was filled. At
that point he discovered the change and decided to LART (complain to
upstreams of) the offenders.
