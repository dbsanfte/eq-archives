Actually Verant mentioned originally that humans have a "bonus." For a
long time people assumed this was an xp bonus, but much poking around
like with Show EQ and such showed that humans were on the baseline xp
with most of the other races (even dark elves with infravision and a
racial hide skill) then your very advantaged races such as ogre, troll
and eventually iksar had the largest penalty (with halfling, for some
odd reason, needing 5 percent less to level than human and other
baseline)

The bonus of humans though are:

Average stats which are not bad or good really.

The most baseline factions with all racial groups and creeds. This is
about the most often overlooked human advantage. Many non diety
agnostic type humans are not kos in the overthere or even from dark
elf guards in nektulous. Their advantage is they start out good with
everyone. Even when you throw in a god they are still starting out
better than say a wood elf with many groups.

I remember when, on a new server, I had a wood elf druid who killed
trumpy or whatever in qeynos at level 7 and was excited to then travel
to butcher to turn it in for the butcher block hammer. Of course,
having left the area at level 2 with my bard message gold for the
greener pastures of misty (where some powerleveling halfling fellow
druid was high enough to bind me by the time I was level 6 in the
misty newb area) I had forgotten that I was glower dubious to dwarves
such as stormguard. Basically it took me from level 7 to level 11 or
something nuts like that killing bandits and goblins in butcher to get
faction high enough with stormguard/fighter's guild to get my butcher
hammer.  

Verant has actually said the faction thing is probably a humans main
bonus. So you could really say that there was a pretty legit reason.
Now, if you are an agnostic human enchanter you have it especially
good I guess. So if you want to have the most average middle of the
road factions with the least trouble of any race and can stand being
night blind and average stats, human is it.
