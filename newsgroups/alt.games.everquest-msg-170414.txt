In general, they have a great reputation for their desktop systems.  Avoid
the lowest end model, it has no AGP slot, the one you chose does.  Their
tech support is usually decent, and the systems are fairly reliable.  Their
laptops have a fairly bad reputation.  If you really shop around, you can
probably get an equivalent system for less, but probably not a whole lot
less.
