One caveat from a druid who has kited gargs starting as low as 18 (even
cons - tough buggers too). Do -not- kite them around the island. Run back
and forth in straight lines (ie, step "through" the mob and run far enough
to pop off another spell). You'll take hits, but it's a lot better than
the alternative.

All druids have SOW on constantly when fighting. If you kite by circling
the island, you'll eventually get so far ahead of the garg that the garg
is going to do the "shortest distance between two points is a straight
line", which means it lumbers over the top of the island to catch you on
the other side. No big deal of course, you'll be long gone by the time he
gets there. But of course, he's brought his spectre buddies from the top
of the hill down to play too - and that's when things get -really-
interesting.
