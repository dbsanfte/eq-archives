Never when I was young and killing bears in Nektulos - never a high quality

I tell my pet to whack down in a left handed blow, that drops the hq skin :)
happened to me 3 times at least now, if not 4....

Was kinda fun when it happened for the first time...
Second time I thought - wow, you are lucky...
