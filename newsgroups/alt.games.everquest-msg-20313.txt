    I don't enforce the rules - the GMs and Guides do. I can choose who I
tell them to bust, though. And if they thought a name I hated was OK - well,
I can whine here, but other than that nothing.

    The name policy, as far as players are concerned, has two aspects. It is
to be personally followed, and it can be used as a sword against anyone you
choose to use it against who did NOT follow it. Until the PnP says that "You
will immediately /report and /petition any behaviour you see against the
PnP", which to the best of my knowledge it does not, I am not obligated to
report anyone.

    Oh, totally agreed here. I thought it was a stupid name, and I knew it
WOULD be busted as soon as a GM or Guide saw it. It amazes me that HE didn't
realize he was using the name on borrowed time, but like I said, some people
feel that VI should NEVER change a name that isn't patently offensive. I'm
not one of them, but Thewarden was.
