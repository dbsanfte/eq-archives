Well, 40-60 odd raiding members of our guild would disagree, so I'm
glad our druids aren't you, especially as you airily discount the
extra mana regen gained. Theres also the 'small' matters of protection
of the seasons, eci and ro debuffs ... done better by.... who, exactly?

Then, dont forget, druid heals and mgb heals, nukes and AE's  done 
admittedly better by clerics & wizzies but - guess what - druids bring 
more flexibility than a roster of 20 clerics, or 20 wizards.

Seriously, if you think druids have no place at the high end you
either need to play in the high end, or find a guild not dead set
on crippling itself by not utilising druids high end (and in some cases
unique) functionality.

Druids pwn ;) We need more, we only have about 2 active ones right
now and its not enough.
