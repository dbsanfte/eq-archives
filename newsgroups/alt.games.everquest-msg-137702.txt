Sorry to interrupt your humiliation of EQ, just wanted to bring up a
point.

I have pet lizards, and while researching their care and breeding I
learned something the general public doesn't realise, but animal
breeders have known for a long time: not all traits pre-determined are
simply "genetic".  For example if you clone a cat, the clone will be
the same colour as the original (genetic), but the colour pattern will
be different (pre-determined before birth, but not "genetic").

I am not an expert in the field, but from what I gather there would be
three types of traits "built-in" at birth:

1- genetic traits- a cat has "the gene(s)" that makes it a white and
orange tabby
2- predetermined but not strictly genetic-  the actual pattern of a
cat's fur, which is fixed before birth but either random or determined
by some function not based solely on genetics
3- Traits built on a complex combination of genes- a clone would
inherit the trait, but most offspring would not.

This muddies the nature vs. nurture argument even more!
