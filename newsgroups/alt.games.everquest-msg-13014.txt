I have one.
People who "loom". You know, stand as close to your character as they
possibly can, frequently stepping over and/or through your toon or your
friend's toon to do so.
This seems to involve a sort of dancing movement (dart forward, hop
back, hop to the side, dart forward, hop to the other side, hop back,
etc) that indicates either that the player is seriously attention
deficient, or the toon needs to find Ye Olde PortaPotty.
After the "looming" comes the inspecting.

(long pause)
Joeblow says, "sow plz!"
(pause)
Joeblow says, "Hail a moss snake"
Joeblow says, "sow! plz!"

Sometimes, they don't even ask. Just /shout while looming at my toon,
"Need sow for CR plz!", or eventually give up and go away.

Gah.
