He has offered a number of sources for you to read.  Not much
"ignorance" there.

It's an *extremely* popular subject here in the U.S.  There are millions
of books written and published here on the subject.  Every history
professor, teacher, or scholar in the U.S. has studied and pontificated
on the topic.  On any given day you can be assured that at least *one*
program on The History Channel (cable TV channel dedicated to historical
analyses, etc.) will be dedicated to some facet of WWII.  Our spell
chekers even know "WWII" (mine keeps wanting to correct it to "W.W.II."
or "WW2").  It's almost a national obsession.

Apparently you didn't read *near* enough.  Take a look at actual
casualty comparisons.  The reasons we got into AND got out of both
conflicts were 100% political.  The withdrawals had zero to do with
military losses.  Militarily, the U.S. was kicking butt and taking names
in both.

> I know about black Americans

Funny.  I not only *know* some, I work with 'em all frag'n day long.  I
socialize with them, went to school with 'em, grew up around 'em. 
You're sample is "limited."

Like I said, your sample is rather limited.  You can't just lump all
blacks together like that.  There are some that love to play the victim
and will take every opportunity and use any pretense.  There are some
that are "pull yourself up by your own bootstrap" and couldn't care
*less* about being called "african american" as opposed to "black." 
There are even a few who go "my ancestors didn't come from Africa, per
se, so that's not accurate."  Finally, I'll tell you about some of the
people in Kenya.  They'll *laugh* at you if you call them black and tell
you that they're "chocolate" and that guy over there is "black."  The
skin color is largely tribal.

Based on your information regarding Korea, Vietnam, and the Black
population of the U.S., I'd have to say that I kinda doubt that.

Of course not.  Your seriously flawed presentation of information about
the U.S. is what means you don't know anything about it.

errr....  well... not exactly.
