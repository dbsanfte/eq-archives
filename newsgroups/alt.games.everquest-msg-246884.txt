That is basically what I'm asking. :)  For some people it is an issue like
you describe above...paying without a guarantee is a baaaaad idea. For
others it is just a question of liking the convenience of credit card.  

Convenience-shmenience I say...it is the ability to contest the charge if
someone fails to come through for you that is important.

I posted this question on another medium and I've gotten an overwhelming
response of "credit card matters!", so I think I have my answer.
