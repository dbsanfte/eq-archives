It's an interesting question. If SOE could trace the duped plats to you,
they might well confiscate or eliminate them. In real life if you were paid
for something using counterfeit money, the authorities would certainly take
that "money" from you no matter how innocent you were in receiving it. How
is this different? The duped plats are no more "real" than counterfeit cash
and have the same disastrous effect on the economy (and justify the same
drastic punishments). In both cases it's "unfair" to the innocent
bystanders, but then the alternative is equally "unfair" to those who did
not profit from the illicit duping as you did. Take your choice.

The other issue here is potential collusion. Just as in the real world,
money laundering can be quite effective in removing the taint of illicit
transactions. All a duper has to do is collude with someone else to buy
things on that player's Trader and suddenly the connection between the money
and the illegal act has been attenuated to the point where it becomes
possible that no one is ever held accountable for the reuslts. Even if they
ban the duper, he comes back in with another account and retrieves his money
from the "innocent bystander".

Managing a player economy is a pretty tricky business and I'm glad to know
that SOE is taking it seriously. Hopefully they can reduce the incidence of
this sufficiently to eliminate most of the exposure to the honest.
