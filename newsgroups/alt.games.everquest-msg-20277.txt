Just out of curiosity, Biz, if you lived in Virginia, where
it's a class 5 felony to engage in oral sex even with your spouse,
punishable by 1-5 years in prison, would you refrain from such
activity, or would you be "inflamed" by what you considered to
be a rule that rightly shouldn't apply to you?

(That makes Virginia's state motto, "Virginia is for lovers",
a bit ironic, doesn't it?)

There's an entire philosophical branch dealing with the
issue of which rules/laws are just, and ought to be followed,
and which are over the top in type, scope, or application,
and ought to make people indignant.  I just don't think you're
dealing with the topic in appropriate depth -- there's a lot
more to this issue than "he must be a self-important idiot
if he doesn't follow all the rules".
