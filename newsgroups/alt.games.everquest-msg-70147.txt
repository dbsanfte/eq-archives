I don't think the comment was intended to offend a level headed
"Fundy" like yourself. I think it was intended for the ones that come
here and claim EQ will destroy your immortal soul, or lead to demon
possession. You know the ones who feel they have been saved and must
save everyone else, whether they want to be saved or not.

"Fundamentalism" should mean sticking to the basics, and adhering to a
teaching in it's original form. Sadly it has been twisted to include
intolerance.

I respect all people of faith. Especially the ones that do not try to
inflict that faith on others.

Cheers
