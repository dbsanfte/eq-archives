I am in the same situation.  My main is a 15th level paladin and he still
wears tattereds in 2/3 of his armor slots.  I constantly see green-con
characters wearing full suits of ring mail (or better; I turned off Examine
Gear so I don't know what they're really wearing) and carrying weapons that
sparkle....

I suppose I can't blame people for wanting to get into the big stuff.
Personally, I enjoy earning gear a piece at a time.  The fine steel plate
that I scrimp and save to buy, or forge myself, will mean much more to me
than any item I'm given.  I also get a fair number of items by trading with
friends of equal level.  Neither of us has access to awesome gear but we
both find things the other can use..
