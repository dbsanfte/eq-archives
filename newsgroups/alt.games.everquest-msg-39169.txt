I of course haven't done any real studies on this or parsed any logs or did any
extrapolations of mathematics with the experience system.  Mobs with the same
CON will give different totals of experience based upon their given difficulty
based on level of the mob, and how much loot they drop.  For exmple the giants
in Oasis and Rathe are IMHO crap for EXP and GREAT for loot.  But the Kunark
Rhinos and Cactusus, etc, in Overthere are GREAT EXP and horrendous loot.
     Of course if one mob cons red and the other cons yellow your probably
gonna get yoru most EXP off the red con if you can take it.
