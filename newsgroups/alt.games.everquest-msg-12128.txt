The best play-on-words guild name I've ever seen is:

   <Clan d'Stein>

Not only is it a great pun on the word "clandestine" (meaning
"done in secrecy"), but the guild has a lot of casters, who 
seem to make a point of always running around with some 
sort of Stein equipped, and of course the name means
literally, "Clan of the Stein".
