No, I can already tell you that doesn't work :/  I've had to sit around 
waiting for my tells to catch up with the conversation.  I think I 
annoyed Cel the other night during a conversation because I seemed to 
not be getting something when in fact, I did, it's just that I couldn't 
let her know that I did ;)
