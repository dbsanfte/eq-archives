Or to put it in a poll question .

Would you rather fear for your person, property , friends and family on a
daily basis .

or

Would you rather wipe the earth of every man , woman , and child that
practices or promotes the religion of Islam.

Since Americans can fairly easily do the later it would be a really damn
good idea not to piss them off much. This is the part of the equation that
the fundamentalists of the Islam religion are unaware. They would also be
terrified at just how many of us would be willing to go with choice 2 and
how quickly the remaining can be convinced. They so do not want a real holy
war .

A simple mushroom cloud over what was LA and it would be all over for 22% of
the worlds population. Here is hoping that the american people accept this
sacrifice of an Iraqi despot and are appeased, and that no further stupidity
is engaged in by the faithfull of Allah.
