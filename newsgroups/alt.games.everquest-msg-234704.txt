Okay .. hypothetical here.  Please excuse my ignorance (Dammit, Jim ... I'm
a programmer not a lawyer.)  Been reading the thread, and something still
doesn't seem quite right.

Fred has an EQ account with Lleggollaaasss the Wood Elf Ranger on it.  Fred
decides that Lleggollaaasss needs some SCHWs, but doesn't have the 3.5K
lying around to buy 'em.  So Fred pops ober to IGE's site and buys himself
10K.  Now:

Assuming that the plat transfer takes place someplace like the PoK, I'm
guessing that somewhere on the server logs there will show an entry for the
trade of 10K plat between the IGE character and Lleggollaaasss.  Short of
getting ahold of copies of IGE's financial records, how can SOE prove that
the transaction wasn't legit for in-game services or such?

I have RL friends that play.  If I'm talking to a buddy on the phone and he
says needs to borrow a few K to get an item, I'll log my main and give him
the cash.  No big whoop.  I log the character, the character goes straight
to the bank, gets the cash, goes straight to another character, hands over
the cash, then pops a squat and logs out.  If SOE goes after both parties in
the 'Fred' hypothetical above based on an entry in a server log, what's to
keep them from going after me for loaning my buddy 5K based on the same
server log?

Someone in another part of the thread mentioned that Yantis sold out to IGE,
and the IGE is in Hong Kong.  Given that, I would think that would make
accessing those financial records to nail Ol' Fred's nuts to the wall would
be somewhat difficult.

Educate me.  I'm not necessarily an idiot, but I don't see where SOE can
start banning people on the assumption that they've done something against
the EULA without hard proof.  Otherwise, they're setting themselves up for a
potential fall.
