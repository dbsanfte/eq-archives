Wood Elves can wear them (as can Dark Elves)

Dustback is a pain to spawn, apparantly he has several place holders one in
each corner of the the zone of something.
One to look for, and AFAIK the only certain one, is A Goblin Raider (rather

(it seems they aggro whatever level) and got nowhere.
I ended up paying the 300pp for one.
