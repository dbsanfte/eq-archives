Actually, the context I was thinking of was to show the roots, and/or
evolution, of our laws and legal system.  So, while a strong case could
be made for the Code of Hammurabi and documents detailing ancient Roman
law, as well as relevant bits of Celtic and Germanic law and custom
(and I don't know what all else, off the top of my head, but I think
that's most of it), the U.S. "common law" and judicial customs are not
informed by all past and present religious and legal systems.

Which is our fundamental point of agreement.  But hey, we're still
free to argue about damned near anything else.  :)
