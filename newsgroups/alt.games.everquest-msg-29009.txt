   I finally got a couple of characters in to break
20.  My husband's main will do the same very soon
now.  We want to get married (well, I do, and I didn't
really give him much choice in the matter).  As anyone
who's seen my sig knows, I enjoy playing a variety of
characters.  So does he.
   So here's first question...can all of my alts be 
married to all of his alts, with the very same surname
between them?  Teashot already has the name "Benlen",
can Tealeef take it when she marries Lennaman?  Or 
Lennaman marry Teashot, then Tealeef, then whoever 
else, if any, who happen to hit 20.  
    Second question....wanna come?  Haven't set a 
date yet, kinda thinking of the Ecommon tunnel (fairly
neutral territory since I am good and he is evil).
I've never been to an EQ wedding before...what's the
protocol for setting up a good one?

Annie  <--- _Not_ trying to round up any gifts...just
             wants to have a good party afterwards.
