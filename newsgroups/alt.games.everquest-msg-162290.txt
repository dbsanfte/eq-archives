With the advent of PoP, at least on our sever, the guild who normally
clean the planes out to kill the gods after server pop have been too
busy racing through the trials to get to the next tier of new content.
We were shocked as all hell to find CT up and alive for three straight
days. After he's down, it's just a matter of either doing the golems
once, or tracking your competition and seeing when they do it and
getting up there three days later. We've had a shocking run of good luck
finding the minis in both Fear and Hate up since PoP came out. In fact,
we finished another Shaman epic last night. (Most of us just killed
black reavers for JR's while the MA and some mage pets killed Rak.)

Tonight? Yet another leafblower. *sigh*. Just to make it interesting I
think we're going to try it with two groups.
