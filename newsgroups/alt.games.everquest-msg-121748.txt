...or is the real world crazy?  Whilst poking around on the internet, I
found a website where you can buy stuff on Everquest for real money.  Why
would someone buy "intellectual property"?  50,000 plat was selling for
$362.  I don't get it!  What is the point of playing the game?

I was going to post the website address, but didn't want to give the EQ
entrepreneur any free advertisements.
