The updated zone is 50+, if not 55+.

Mobs were dark blue to 60. On track I saw a handful of greens, a whole
ton of dark blue, one light blue named and some white mobs. Nothing
higher than level 60 showed up on track when I was there.

Some mobs summon, some banish to Ferrott. A lot of mobs aren't
messable. Standing at the zonein is suicide given the number of
trains. Never zone in without invis up.

We moved in and away from the courtyard. Group consisted of a 60
pally, 60 druid, 60 chanter, 58 necro, 56 magician and 56 cleric. We
fought a bunch of oozes. They could be mezzed without difficulty. The
only decent drop was a bracer. Think the stats were:

12ac 5str 5dex 5wis 30hp 30mana, rogue/ranger, nodrop

From the sounds of it all the good loot is class specific and nodrop.
