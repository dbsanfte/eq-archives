If you go there and take a look, I bet you'll see that more than a few didn't.
Last time I was there it was around 90 people.

As for convenience...  There is a melee bind point 2 zones away, same as
Velks.  (Better than Velks for people on Giant Faction.) Also there are
vendors and a bank *in the damn zone*  Now there is convenience you can't beat
with a stick.    Also, it's much bigger than Velks.   Velks is crowded with 30
people - Group in Upper Kobolds, group in Lower Kobolds, group in Frenzy,
group in Crystal Eyes and a group or two clearing the spiders at the bottom.
Any more than that and you're fighitng for spawns (even with that).

The zone is more open than Velks or any real dungeon, with more room to move
around in safety.   If there are any wanderers in the zone, I haven't seen
them yet.   It appears to just be a series of separate camps, with a very fast
respawn .  Plenty to kill, even with those 90 people in zone that I mentioned
before.

Due to the convenience and the low difficulty of the zone (some of the easiest
50+ hunting I've seen.) I predict that Fungus Grove is going to be the Ill
Omen for post 50's.   With everything that entails.  LFG's, ooc chatter and
idiots.   It'll be where those who can't take a real dungeon go to hit 60.
(Then stay to max out alternate experience.)
