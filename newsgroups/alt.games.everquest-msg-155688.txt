Anybody else who solos here noticed the change? I've struggled but I just
can'seem to take down more than a light blue, despite fair gear? I could
fight a blue with reasonable downtime before but now I'm like I was before
doing a massive gear upgrade a few months ago and spending about 20 K.

According to monkly business most every item is right for a 50 monk, only
thing i'm missing is the epic, got a stave a shielding and wu's, but don't
have a tough guild to get my epic with.

Fungi tunic costs 55 K on my server and currently I have 1.5. Should I just
farm for a few months, or would i be on light blues still with the fungi? I
noticed my druid can kill 4 dark blues in the time it takes for my monk to
kill 2 or 3 lt blues, and the druid's gear was cheaper.

I was thinking I might start another class and retire the monk (mebbe
they'll nerf the nerf).  What sort of class can solo but still be useful to
a guild in the high end game, apart from a druid? Should I start a mage?
