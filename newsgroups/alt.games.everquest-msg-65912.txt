I have the same problem.

Athalon 700
512 ram
Geforce 3 with new drivers
DirectX8.1

After browsing the tech boards for information on why I have terribly long
zone times I found a possible reason.  It seems a good portion of the people
suffering from long zone times use AMD and Athalon processors.   The poster
speculated that the new Everquest engine is compressing the texture files at
zone time using a format that the Intel processors have streamlined.  Those
using AMD and athalon's see their systems bog down doing this compression.
He also speculated that an easy fix for Verant would be to have the
compressed files stored on the hard drive and have EQ search there for the
files before attempting to compress them in the processor.  More HD space
but faster zoning.  Made sense to me but I am not a tech.

I am following this post.
