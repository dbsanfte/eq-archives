It's not actually the same thing - paying for extra slots is even less
value comparably.  If you convert things to how much time you get for
your money.  In your example you would get to use your car for twice as
long for less than twice the money.  As the time that anyone has to
play is finite, paying extra money for twice as many character slots
would not allow you to play the game any more than you already do.
(assuming that you already play as much as you can)

The question that I am debating is this - will paying an extra $7(?)
increase my enjoyment whilst I am playing?  If I get bored playing one
character I could get more enjoyment from the game playing an alt. 4
characters is not enough for me - I have 2 mages, a scout and a
fighter.  The only expendable one of those is the fighter as I haven't
started playing it yet.  I would like to try at least two of the
fighter classes and at least two of the priest classes.  Fortunately I
have no inclination to try any other scout class (I am a predator on my
way to Assassin) and I have no inclination to try a sorceror right now
- otherwise 8 slots might not be enough!
(Sorry started rambling there)
