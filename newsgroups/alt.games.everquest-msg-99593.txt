     It's been that way since about Wednesday.

     You can still get on the big ship by swimming out in front
of it and letting it sail over/through you.  Move a bit and you'll
end up standing inside the lower deck.  If you dive into the ocean
from the very end of the pier, you shouldn't encounter any sharks.
They hug the bay and the shoreline, not the open water.
