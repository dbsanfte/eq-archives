I'm a Dark Elf Necromancer and I'll be LV6 in 1 blue bubble EXP.
I'd like to go somewhere that is a good place for my LV to hunt bone chips.
I've thought about the Qeynos newbie area.  I've also thought about Field of
Bone in Kunark.  I'd like to get a large supply, maybe some more to take
back with me to sell.  I survive by the player economy, each character funds
themselves mainly by selling what others are looking for but don't have time
(or will) to collect.

What is a good place to go for my LV that provides great supply of bone
chips and hunting, as well as is safe for my LV and few levels above? Is
Field of Bone a good choice or Qeynos newbie area or somewhere else?

By the time I get back to this I might be LV7 or 8. If I'm not yet 8, then I
might consider an extra backpack for my LV8 spells.

My faction is dubious with most of Freeport, apprehensive to a few. I've
never tried N Freeport though, and I think the wizards don't like me. I've
only screwed up my orc faction, went from "threateningly" to "scowls", which
is KOS either way so doesn't matter.
