Well general thinking says, put all in stam and str and play a Ogre or Troll
as Race...of course this is also know as numbercrunching and doesn't always
lend itself to good roleplaying.
My warrior has 142 str and 62 of that is equipment (at 42nd level) his Sta
is 86 or 92 depending on the shoulder item I am wearing. He is a Dark Elf,
not the best choice for a warrior (in fact, possibly the worst by the above
school of thought) He has (at his best) 85% MR without further buffs. When
made (ages ago) I "wasted" points in agility (highest stat already) this was
a mistake, I admit, not because Sta and Str are more important but because
agility does so little for you.
If I made a warrior again, I'd choose another Dark Elf, why? because I get
to look like this;

If you like the character, stick with it. Your lower stats will make a
difference but it's hardly a noticable one. I don't spend a second thought
on wasted stat points, only on my next level and what items I need/want to
improve my effectiveness.

Good Luck
