Experiment over.

Result:

Prove them wrong and they will kill file you.  Prove them hypocrites and
they will kill file you.  Point out on occasion after occasion that you're
right and they will kill file you.

Conclusion:

One fucked up group of human mass.  I welcome the opportunity to be part of
your kill files.  You do me the justice of proving me right.  Thank you, one
and all.
