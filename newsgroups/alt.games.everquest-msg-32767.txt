Maybe if you're biased from having hunted HGs in Rathe for most of your
life.

smacking down the level 12 sisters in OOT was fun (but I had to run muffins
from EK to fix the faction, hehe) and I can see how it would be profitable
if you were evil, kill a crapload of sisters, gate, sell belts for ~1pp ea.,
boat back, kill more, rinse and repeat.

Also, GLS gives ~10 pp, which (if you're untwinked) is good money up to
about 20-25, when you should be looting more in the time it takes you to get
a GLS off of exp mobs.

But, I still smack down every bear I see on reflex (must... get... HQ...
pelt... need... new... armour....), which can be a bit disturbing in
everfrost, where they spawn faster than i can blast them into oblivion (cubs
in newb area) and ninjaloot them (soloing of course, hehe, they're looted
before the corpses stop twitching, then I kill more)
