Belarc Advisor is a program that looks at the hardware and software
installed on your PC and gives you a very detailed report.  It includes
information on your OS, CPU, hard drives, motherboard, memory, video cards,
network cards, sound cards, joysticks, and a whole slew of info on
all installed software packages.

A very nice product.
