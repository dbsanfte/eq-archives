No, I would not suggest that.  But, you can usually find such mobs in 
some zones, and the xp return, particularly after the change to increase 
xp significantly from "high" con mobs, is well worth it.  At level 65, 
Fire was an awesome zone to solo in.  At level 70, I don't actually know 
off hand of a good place to go for white or higher con mobs to solo, so I 
still go to fire, or to WoS for my soloing, depending on whether I feel 
like root and rot (boring but safe), or letting the mobs smack me around.  
I actually don't solo much anymore at all with my shaman, if I can't 
find/make a group I go play my level 26 enchanter, soloing blue, white, 
yellow, and red mobs using charm.  One of these days I should actually 
bother to spend a couple k pp on my enchanter and get her out of the gimp 
Velious and earlier era gear she is wearing.  Also just found out 2 days 
ago that Clarity is now a level 26 spell, when I went to see what spells 
I can scribe after dinging.  I first made the mistake of checking casters 
realm for spells, and found how horribly inaccurate it still is for 
spells, it still lists the old levels for the spells, whereas, Lucy, as 
has always been the case for me, was quite up to date.
