I love it!  No one pesters my druid for ports anymore, and my ranger doesn't
spend half her time running across zones.

Of course!  And they should still do that, the difference now is that they
would be exploring, not making the "dreaded run".
(Since they don't lose their gear if they die it's not like its a big deal.....
 kids have it so easy these days...)
