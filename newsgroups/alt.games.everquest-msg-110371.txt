Hmm, isn't being a legend in their own mind enough?   ;)
  From a roleplay pov, what does the general population of norrath care if a
freelance warrior hits the pinnacle of his/her abilities?  Enough to erect a
"Shrine of the Holders of the Uber Gear?"  The staisafction of doing it is,
I think, enough for most people without some kind of public recognition of
their accomplishment.  Isn't it?
