I personally hope that they implement this in EQ2. 

It wouldn't be that hard. If they put the effort into a real name
generator for each race (similar to the novelty ones you see on the
Internet), the process would become viable.

The name generator we have now in EQ is almost there. It uses vowel
and consonant combinations that are specific to each race. If they
built on that, and allowed players to build a name from these
combinations (eq pick from a list for each syllable), you could have
eliminate the stupid name problem and still give players room to be
creative and unique.
