No way to double check your stats easily at present, but assuming that
the Centi SS is 12/25 (even though you wrote 11/25 second), then
copelands says that your DPM is going to be about 12 higher using the
Centi in primary and the Velium in secondary. It's a difference between
590 and 602.

Keep in mind we don't know your class or level or stats, so I just
punched in a random 40th level warrior with a base STR of 125 to make
the comparison. So those raw numbers are probably wrong, but the ration
between them and which one will yield a greater damage output should be
correct.  But usually, yes... you put the faster weapon in the primary
unless it's a weird combination with very close stats like this one. If
the Centi is actually 11/25, then swap them around.
