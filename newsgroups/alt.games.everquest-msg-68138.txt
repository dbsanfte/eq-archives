Close, but not quite. The least important of those stats, as I see it,
is your processor. I'm in the "life is good" camp, and I've got a
P3-600. My wife's machine is likewise doing well with a P3-500. But yes,
I think that 512 MB RAM and a *good* quality 64 MB RAM video card (we
have both) are needed for the "life is good" enjoyment of EQ. Then
again, that's pretty much what VI said you would want for the
"reccomended" specs, eh?
