It is good to note that although most spells can be purchased, you may have 
to go through a bit of work to get them. For example, each rank of Druid 
teleport spells are only bought at one certain location. Enchanters must 
get their third rank pet from a certain vendor.

As far as buying spells, save every penny you make for quite a few 
levels... Every time you get a new spell rank you should be able toi buy 
all your spells.

In addition, you may reorganize it by rightclicking the appropriate spell 
in the book and then right clicking on another spot elsewhere in the book.

It also speeds up memorizing and scribing spells.

To add to this...

Specialization introduces a chance, each time you cast, to spend a bit less 
than the normal amount of mana to cast the spell. You may specialize in all 
disciplines, but the one that goes over 50 first will be the only one that 
goes over 50. 

Se eq.castersrealm.com for more details and suggestions- I'd suggest 
reading all of what it says about your class. www.eqdruids.com is cool too.

Use it constantly. Every time it recycles. This skill takes FOREVER to get 
at a decent level.

...and while it is getting up there, you will get Summon Food and Summon 
Drink. :)
