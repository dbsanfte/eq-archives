I just reactivated my account last night and am having the same problem.  I'm 
glad you guys started this thread.

I have a new firmware version, so I'm sure that's the culprit.  It sounds like 
I can downgrade the firmware or change the setting that you mention.

I'm guessing that your solution was to go to the setup of the Linksys and go to 
the MAC Addr. Clone tab under the Advanced area and set the MAC address of the 
Linksys to the MAC address of my machine I play EQ on.  Does this sound 
correct?  I'd rather get it working than downgrade my firmware.
