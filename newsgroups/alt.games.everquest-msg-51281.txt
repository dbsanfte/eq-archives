Yes, one of the things I like about DAOC is that everyone in the group, who
has initiated the quest, gets the quest item when they kill the quest mob.
We were a full group of 8, but we lost 3 to attrition bringing us down to 5.
There were others waiting for the mob that were not in our group, and they
were whittled down to 1.  Well, this guy (Loial) didn't want to join our
group; I assume he was operating under the misconception that the first one
to attack a mob has some kind of "ownership" to it.  Anyway, the mob did
finally spawn, and everyone in our group left with their new quest item,
followed by shouts of "kill-stealers".
