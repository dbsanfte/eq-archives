Bard, warrior, rogue, wizard, cleric, druid, monk, necromancer.

Thats it eh?

I think I'd get bored fairly quickly.

I'd have done something similar, though, creating several archetypes and 
then letting them diverge by making choices between abilities; I don't 
want to see fewer classes, in a way, I want to see -more- classes.

So I'd have gone

Fighter
Rogue
Priest
Magician

As it turns out, thats the old AD&D model, go figure.

Anyway, you could then specialize in damage mitigation/avoidance to 
become a fighter tank= warrior

Or you could adopt priestly abilities to become fighter priest = paladin

Or you could adopt wizardly abilities to become fighter mage =  well 
something vaguely like SK, only that would really be a later sub option

You can derive most of the current classes by combining abilities from 
the basic four... Neverwinter Nights does something like this by 
allowing you to combine up to 3 classes, although it also has a list of 
classes as long as your arm.

Funny thing is, I wouldn't be suprised to find that there is already a 
MMOG with just such a system; I just don't pay much attention, EQ, as 
unruly a beast as it is, still keeps my attention, in part because 
there's still things I have yet to try.

To me, adding beastlords was unneccesary really, as I still had lots to 
try already, but berserker has been a nice breath of fresh air as it 
came in as a new class just when I was in the market for one.

Similarly, I had fun with Vah Shir, and even a bit with Frogloks, 
because they were something different.

I'd vote for More races, More classes, but I'd vote for making them both 
different and effective; berserkers seem to fit neither, honestly, 
although they are enjoyable into the mid 50s at least.
