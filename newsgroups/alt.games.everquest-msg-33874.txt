Of course, stupid me, i could get some jewelry with this effect to i
believe, but they may be very expensive, currently having  like 8gp in
the bank would make that difficult.
Spent my 4 pp in thurgadin buying some armor, i was drooling over that
tizmak armour but hey 49pp per piece :(

Is it that spell that requires fish scales? that i can bring since
they can be found in neriak and are not very expensive.
