The game certainly has evolved in the 2 1/2 years I've played and I too miss
certain aspects of game play that have changed.  The constant shouts of
items for sale from the tunnel in E. Commons, the excitment that came from
recieving some "great" item to add to my nearly empty inventory by a kindly
"high level" just passing by, the comradery that seemed to develoup between
players grouping together for the first time in a new and unknown zone, and
certainly the excitment/fear of traveling across "vast" zones of unknown
danger for the first ( or sometimes second, third or even tenth time) to
mention just a few.

I can't say that I'd like to give up PoP and go back to the days of hoping a
Druid or Wizzy were porting somewhere in the zone I was curently in so as to
be able meet up with friends in a far off zone though.  Or relive the
"thrill" of entering the world for the first time buck naked with a club,
torch, water bag and some biskets wanting to make my way across the frozen
twisted passages of Halas just to be able to die a few dozen times in BB
trying to get to Surfall to "maybe" get a "freebee" port to Freeport to be
able to play with a RL friend who was also a newbee.  Often these types of
experiences gave way to frustratrion and fleating thoughts of Doom and Quake
and perhaps finally giving hell level a try or wondering if I'd delated the
nifty little free program called GameSpy from my hard drive.

Certainly there have been some needed enhancments to the game and a few
changes that perhaps shouldn't have been made but the opposite of progress
is.... and very little in this world stays the same forever.  One can only
hope thoes who now sit and anxiously wait for the hour or six, depending on
connection type, patching to end so as to begin creating their first
character find equal delight in aspects of the game us jaded "high levels"
have long forgotten or now take for granted.  Having just a week ago given
my father-in-law a set of disks, and a years subscription to EQ, I'm pretty
sure the game still holds many of the wonders and thrills newbees have
always come to remember fondly in later years.  Our phone convesation last
night convinced me of that.  A very long time and dedicated Delabo/DelaboII
player who never had any interest in EQ and was anxiously awaiting a big
patch to that game is now an EQ'er working feveriously on his level 15
Beastloads skills before heading back out to, in his words, "the vast,
confussing and dangerous" zone called  the Oasis of Marr to level 16.  He
loves it!  His friend and also a Delabo die-hard stopped by yesterday
afternoon and my father-in-law showed him EQ while he was visiting.  That
was the reason he called my last night.  He wanted to know what EQ package
his friend should get since he's going to buy the disks Sat. morning too and
can't wait to start playing!

So regardless of changes/enhancements I think the "newness" of it is still
there for the first time players plus a hell of a lot of fun!

Good hunting
