It's sad that you would equate your comment and John Lennon's.  If you don't
understand the difference, there really is no hope of ever making you
understand.  Ignorance, seemingly easily remedied, is often the most
powerful adversary of its own solution.

I ignored the ignorance of your original comment because, well, you're
bizbee so a certain amount of ignorance is expected.  The comparison to John
Lennon I couldn't let slide.   =P
