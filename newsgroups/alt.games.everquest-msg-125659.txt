Youre ok on luclin, velious, evil outpost in kunark, most of freeport. As
well as those, there are vendors in many zones that will sell to you. I
wouldnt bother with qeynos... hunting around there isnt so great. Id
probably go through nexus to greater fay and hunt around there somewhere...
orc hill or butcherblock probably. Watch out for the dwarf guards, they will
kos you. I tink kelethin are just dubious... they wont attack but they wont
sell. Not sure about that tho, so best to check con first.
