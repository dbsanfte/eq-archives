Well, like I said in my other post, a lot of the policies on rezzes
and reimbursals had only one change: The words "will not" were changed
to "may not", which to me implies that it's more open to GM
discression than before. It's now saying basicly "we're not saying you
will or won't get your rez, just that it's not likely..."
