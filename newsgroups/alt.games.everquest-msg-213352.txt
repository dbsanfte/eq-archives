Anyone else have autorun turn on by itself after the recent patches?
I'll be stopped, and start moving using my regular movement keys, and
occasionally when I let go to stop, autorun is on.

The first few times I saw this, I wasn't paying a lot of attention, and
had been doing things where I *might* have used autorun, so when I found
myself running when I *thought* I shouldn't have been, it could have been
my mistake.

However, I now just saw one that definitely wasn't anything like that.  I
finished medding, ran forward, snared a mob, and started kiting, stopping
several times to turn and nuke.  When I let go of "forward" to stop after a
few of these run/stop/nuke cycles, I found autorun on.  During this entire
process, my right hand is on the mouse, and my left is on the left side of
the keyboard.  I checked, and NUMLOCK is the only thing mapped to autorun,
so there is no way I accidently engaged it.
