It's not really so bad on FV. Even though you can get around the TLC
with a raid, most people aren't farming greens. Because everything is
tradable (almost everything) people who farm, will farm level
appropriate stuff. It's generally more profitable.

See the farming situation you experience on your server, is at least
partly because the high level stuff is all no drop, so the few mobs
that drop droppable gear (that's any good) are heavily camped. On the
other hand if people can make more money just selling the gear that
would otherwise rot if it was no drop, they make far more money than
they would by camping extra green mobs for drops that are weak in
comparison to what is dropping on level appropriate mobs.

So, it's not really a problem on FV. The big guilds aren't camping the
Kunark, Velious, or Luclin stuff for the drops, simply because the
stuff they get from PoP and GoD mobs is so much better.

The only time I've seen people use Raid to get past the TLC is when
they are getting epic drops that are covered by the TLC, or on a few
occasions someone was slaughtering greens for vendor sellable stuff,
that because it was magic (for example light stones) or lore would not
drop otherwise. It's not too common though, and if it is, no one is
really competing for the drops.

So it can work, if the TLC is implemented to keep people honest. (Even
as easily as it is bypassed.)

Now, as for plat sellers... That seems to be something of an epidemic
on the server, though probably not as bad as it is on other severs. I
remember someone a while back posting a document on how the plat
sellers were fixing the prices in the bazaar, forcing people to pay
more plat for stuff. That was supposedly easy for them, because due to
the shortage of really powerful droppable loot, they were able to buy
it all up, or at least a significant portion thereof. On FV, there is
all kinds of stuff out there, you are not locked into a small set of
things you can buy, that can be abused. So most of the good stuff
doesnï¿½t go for much more than 10-30k, with only a few really high end
things in each category going for 100k or more. Now it's possible that
someone is trying to fix the prices on those high end items, but when
you can get a BP with 69AC for 100k (the best in the bazaar), and one
with 54AC for 10k (Actually I got mine for 6.5k), I'm going to have to
say, if they are trying to fix prices they aren't doing a really good
job of it.
