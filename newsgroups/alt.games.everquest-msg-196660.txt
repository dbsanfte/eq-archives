Bah, rereading that it has a bad tone - blame a bug I've been chasing :-P

(found it - all my fault, much as I'd love to blame ASP.Net for it :-|
At the end of a custom validation control's validate handler I had the
page.isvalid at false (as it should have been) then the moment I stepped
out of the routine it was switching to true - without going through any
of my code.  Hmmmmmm - would have helped if I had set the eventargs.isvalid
property to false instead of the calling control's property)
