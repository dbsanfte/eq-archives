Not entirely useless, but not far.  40ish, I wanted to catch up my defensive
skills so I started soloing Ruathey (35 barb War in LS).  It was a very good
match for me and I'd have to use the zoneline on more than occasion.
Sometimes using up a poison seemed to be just enough to tip the scales in my
favour.

About 25-30 plat will get you to Master (100) but getting the vials to
trivial will start to add up.  I'm at 163 now and have almost a full box of
zombie skins in the bank (They're best since they're so universally dropped
and used to be the only stacking skin).  Since my use of poisons has tapered
off till I get some upgrades, they'll stay banked for a while.
