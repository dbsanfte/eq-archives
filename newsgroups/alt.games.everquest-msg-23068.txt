This is exactly right.

Are you sure ?

As I understand it the first explanation you had was correct.
I.e.
For each coin type divide by the number of party members and the looter
gets any remainder.

So for a drop of 6p6g6s6c everyone should get 1p1g1s1c while for
5p5g5s5c the looter gets the lot.
This is especially annoying for casters.
My cleric sat there medding for *levels* getting 3 - 5 gold per Mob with
1pp once in a blue moon. Of course since I was getting loot from the
aytosplit some of the tanks thought that this was fair. They in the mean
time were picking up 1-5 pp per kill plus some gold. (About 3-4 time as
much as me).

I now usually insist on Alpha-nosplit or Master looter.
This way there is some sort of fairness.

I'm sure that once I get up to my 30s it will be better with larger pp
drops.

The sarnark fort just seems to be the first place that people notice
this.
