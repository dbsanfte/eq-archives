}Right??  :^)

I don't see where you got that from what I posted, but I would have no 
problem with that.  Many anti-discrimination laws refer to "sexual 
orientation"... Could swing be considered a sexual orientation?

I gotta admit though, swing has always struck me as a rather lame-sounding 
name for that lifestyle.  It just seems like a subset of polyamory.  But 
whatever.
