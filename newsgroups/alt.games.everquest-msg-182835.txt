Sorry, but this questions pop up everyday...
You played your Character to level 60. So you should know every possible 
   ability your character has and know every tactic you can use to kill 
mobs and help groups.
Now hit V and you see "da da" the AA-Window.
Click every Ability that is listed there, read the description and 
figure out, if this will help you and your playstyle, train into it, if 
not, ignore it ....
