Like was suggested, alt.games.everquest2 was hijacked because I made the
mistake of posting a proposal to alt.config that I didn't follow through
on immediately.  IE, someone took my proposal and submitted it on the sly,
most likely WITHOUT the charter.  Not sure what affect this has, but if
someone now notices that it exists on their newsserver, 'twasn't me that
did it.
