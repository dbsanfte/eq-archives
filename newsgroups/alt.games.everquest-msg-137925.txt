You mean bard + monk I assume... at any rate monk is a given for this thread.

I find bardic fear kiting to be an exercise in frustration.  Like all bard
songs,
snare and fear are both maximum 3 tic duration, and don't stick any too
reliably.  While its perfectly adequate for most uses to see a mob unsnared
for 6 seconds or resisting some other song for 6 seconds, a fear kite works
only when both snare and fear are on.  Resist fear and the mob turns around
and pounds you.  OK, so a few seconds of being pounded on every now
and then isnt' so bad.  But resist Snare and the mob runs off at its top land
speed.

One solution is to sing selos so you can keep up... but now you've thrown
away another leg of the classic melee tripod, killed one song for fear
and a second for running speed.

Also, the fear is an AOE fear.  While normal fear kiting already has its
limitations,
here you have to worry about normally non-aggro mobs in your fear path,
and you need a fear path much longer than normal because of the occaisional
stretches of unsnared flight.

As a cleric who frequently partners with rangers and druids, I'm a strong
proponent of fear kiting, but I just can't see it as more than an occaisional
stunt to kill something you are having trouble with, as a bard.
