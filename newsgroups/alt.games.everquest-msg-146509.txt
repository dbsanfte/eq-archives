You are going to have to be more specific than that.  Which spells exactly
do you need?  If they are gate or something like that, they can be purchased
at other types of guilds (like cleric for example).  I play an Erudite necro
and some of the spells I needed were on a separate merchant, but in the same
area.  They were the misc. type spells that were not specifically designed
for necros and all of them, no matter what level, were all on one vendor.
There may be a merchant of this type in Neriak, but I don't know for sure.

You might also try Casters Realm.  They list all the spells for each level,
and if you click on the spell it will take you to a link that gives
information about where to purchase the spell.

Good Luck
