The healsong isn't really a heal, its a regen.  You group with the bard,
you get a little buff icon that regens you 12 or so HP a tic while he's
playing it.

Being a bard is really marvelous in some ways; you don't get many
people asking you to PL them (which is really what the buff and
heal beggers want, your time and energy to help them level up
or get more loot faster) and you don't have a whole lot of need
for the various buffs that other classes want.  SOW?  It helps,
no doubt about it, but there's always Selo's.  Clarity?  Hah,
I wish it would help, but it doesn't.  Haste?  Well, sure, thats
nice, but there's no real need to melee mobs much in the
first place.  HP/AC buffs?  Again, helpful but getting hit
isn't really all that much of the plan anyway.  Need to get from
point A to point B?  Run to nearest nexus, port up port down
run to destination.  A port would be faster of course, but
zones are so small with Selos up that the "run to Nexus" part
is a trivial operation, its the 15 minute wait that slows you down.

While I'll glady accept most any buff, I've never asked for
one  as a bard from anyone I'm not grouped with, something
not true of any of my other characters.

On the other hand, trading buffs isn't possible, other than
"group with me and let me get you FM, quicker than C3 and
it stacks if you do have clarity..."
