Actually once its 1/3x 2/3y, either the x group or the y group can 
attack. If the 1/3 faction attacks it always wins (unless the players 
intervene on the defense). If the 2/3 faction attacks it always loses, 
unless the players intervene on the offense.

I never manipulate the war while other people are hunting there.
