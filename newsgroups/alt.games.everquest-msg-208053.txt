Probably a keylogger to steal your password. A virus would not be so
EQ specific. This is a bad year for EQ. The crap this year is worse
than ever.

They can strip your account by knowing your station ID and password,
there is an easy exploit to make you type your station ID and password
over again. Some even can work as bots, which mean they can act on
command from a master channel.

Everyone get this software to detect these things. It it german, and
detects those, other spyware, and many other problems. If you are
suspicious, check it out from a source you trust, or look at other
keylogger detection programs.
