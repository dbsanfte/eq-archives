Long ago, the guild <Ring of Fire> (if I recall correctly), did a similar
thing on EMarr.  I think they were using it as a recruitment tool, as it was
held in Blackburrow.

What they did was take some of their excess lower end guild items from their
bank, and arranged it so that's the stuff that would drop from the BB Gnolls
for a certain length of time.

Before the appointed time for the event to start, they had their own
guildies run through the zones around Qeynos, shouting something like, "The
Gnolls of Blackburrow have raided one of our outposts!  Everyone...come join
us strike back at the gnolls and reclaim what is ours!"

The event ran for a set length of time.  When the loot ran out, the guild
held contests in Blackburrow to round out the event.  It was a great way for
them to distribute stuff like Fine Steel Weapons and minor gems to the area
newbies and lowbies.  It was a great event.
