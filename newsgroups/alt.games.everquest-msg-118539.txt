I ported to Wakening Lands so my Druid could buy a level 39 spell.  I had
heard it was dangerouse but I had also been told by others "no problem just
cast invis as soon as you arrive."  Well I ported in with both invis and
lessor succor memmed.  Wuoshi stunned me as soon as I arrived preventing me
from casting either spell.  He then proceded to kill me.

What to do, what to do?  I am on Firiona Vie so creating another character
as a necro is out of the question.  I don't know any necros and it will be
hard to convince a stranger to trek accross three zones to summon my corpse
from Kael (wish someone had told me before I ported that the way to get my
spell was GD - EW - Kael - WL - oh well die and learn!)

I have been told that if I try to invis and drag corpse, Wuoshi will kill me
as soon as I drag it.  Should invis and go to the Tower and beg or buy some
help?  Can I bind myself in the tower?

Any suggestions will be greatly appriciated!
