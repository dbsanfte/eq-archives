Best single group armour, roughly in order worst to best,

5 DoN crystal bought armour
4 OoW tier 1 armour
2 PoR single group armour (all but chest and legs buyable in bazaar)
2 OoW GM Tradeskill Armour
1 TSS single group armour

Note with the OoW tier 1 armour the chest and legs probably aren't 1 
groupable if it's an upgrade.

It varies depending on a few things, and it's more complex for casters 
because of the focus effects involved.

PoR and OoW GM Tradeskill armour are roughly on par, and the DoN Crystal 
bought armour is decent if you fully aug it out (easy now considering 
crystals are like 21pp each).

Best bet - go for all 5 mixing and matching as required based on what 
you can get.  For ease of camping the PoR armour is much easier than the 
OoW tier 1 armour, in my view, since you only need 1 drop and all but 
legs / chest is droppable.

I wrote several long documents for our guild looking at how the plate 
armour compares, which I can try and repost here if anyone's interested.
