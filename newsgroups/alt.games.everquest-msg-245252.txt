    The second time, yes.

    The first time anyone has the option of grouping with you, they usually
haven't the faintest clue how good YOU are, and will go on things like
level, guild, and class - which is where class perceptions/balance come in.

    Yeah, and after 18 months, 65 levels, 100AA's, tons of carefully
selected and earned gear, I'm a pretty good shadowknight.

    Unfortunately, a pretty good shadowknight comes out poorly next to
favorably unbalanced classes who may be played relatively badly.

    Yes if someone's a *total* idiot it doesn't matter what class they
play - they will suck. But I haven't seen many total idiots about since I
hit the 60's. Usually even if someone's a dickhead they'll have *some*
apparent skill.
