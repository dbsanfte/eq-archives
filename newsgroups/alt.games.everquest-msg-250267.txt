You characters will be active for up to 6 months, would you decide to
return. My 42 Bard was still there after I quit for more then a year. If you
are going to be greedy and not give your stuff to newbies in game that can
actually use it, please do us all a favor and DELETE your characters.

If you delete them, there is no reason for SOE to keep your characters on
file, and your connection with SOE will be severed completely. If you don't,
there is always that chance you may start again...... which is probably the
reason why you don't delete your characters in the first place.

Do your guildies a favor, at least make em happy with yer stuff. Then
proceed to DELETE you characters and really be done with it.
