I was trying to see how many people were online from a particular guild and
couldn't find the correct arguments to use on the /who.  Most guilds, one of
the words in their name will work, like Uberfreaks of HillaryDuff, you could
search HillaryDuff or Uberfreaks, {/who all uberfreaks}, and find them,
although not always or not usually for both words even.  I had a guild
member standing in front of me and he didn't show when I did a who on the
words in his name so I know someone was online and should have shown up.

Anyone know of a better way to find how many people are online in a guild in
which you aren't a member?

PS Looking for a good guild, btw... something 50 and up or so?
