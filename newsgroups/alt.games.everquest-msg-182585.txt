Great to see wizards get another Infravision and See Invis spell! I have
been waiting a long time for a spell like this, because most wizards don't
have infravision :) and no wizards have familiars that grant us See Invis
from before either :) All this at level 44 oh boy! Get ready for the nerf
bat when this hits the market!

I was hoping they would give us an MGB True North spell or something that
was atleast funny since they cannot give us something usefull.
