Flat butts??

One of the things that first struck me about the new Wood Elf
model was how actually rounded their butts are now.  Before, they
were a pretty flat wedge shape that was artificially made
to look rounded by coloring highlights.

Now they're actually incredibly curved and rounded.  Very
callipygian.

Of course, it helped that the first time I saw the new ones
a graphics bug caused them to be actually naked instead of
covered in "newbie armor".

And the Human models seem to share the same butts.  Which
is actually a drawback, because while broad hips look great
on the Humans, they don't seem "willowy" enough for what
I'd expect a Wood Elf to be.  They should be more slender.

If what you're seeing is "flat", try taking off the armor
plate -- unlike the pre-Luclin models, armor actually changes
the 3D shape of the body now.
