Not quite. You'd just need to get the checksum from the actual official 
files and send that back instead of your own checksum. Remember the server 
only knows what the client tells it. If you wrote the client it can tell 
the server whatever you programmed it to say. Basically as long as you keep 
all the official files up to date and used their checksums you'd be ok. (At 
least a far as checksums go.)
