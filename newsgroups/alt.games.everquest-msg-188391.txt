I have never seen that map before, it is almost what I was looking for.  The
map I saw was what looked to be a scanned image of the original cloth map
that came in the box, and was chopped up and put back together in a more
exacting representation of how the zones connected.  I enjoyed it for the
humor factor alone, as the continents were severely misshapen after the
"corrections"

thank you for your input Jennaii
