There just aren't that many places where DOT/DS/TF and melee is done on a
regular basis.  Not when snare/root/dot is more mana efficient and a HELL of
a lot safer, starting at level 14 and going up to at least 52 (so far).

It doesn't come into play until level 49, but I still can't see the point of
quad kiting.  You snare 4, round them up, and start casting Fire as soon as
you can...which is about 20' from you (or it feels like it, anyway :p).  Way
too many critters getting a hit or two off me after every cast.  Obviously
I'm doing something wrong but the spell distance does seem to suck big time.
