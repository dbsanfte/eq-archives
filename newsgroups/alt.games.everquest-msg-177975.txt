Are you in software? *one* person testing it quite likely would have told
them nothing. Really.

As they mentioned in a subsequent message, it was a behavior that they did
not see until there was sufficient load on the server. The code in question
had been on test already, where LOTS of people were essentially testing it.
Not all servers saw the problem - which isn't surprising since some servers
have a substantially lower population than others - not the same load.

As to it taking three tries. You're right - it shouldn't have. That said, it
does in software like this all the time. Why? Well, imagine that you've just
brought a system up, and you have 50,000 customers all logging in. Now,
imagine that you're having big problems and you have 50,000 ticked off
customers. Most people will make exactly the same mistake - they RUSH. Some
developer says "Oh, I know that that is!!!!! HERE - it's FIXED!". Some
trusting exec says "THANK TUNARE!!!!" and says to load it. Ooops, that
wasn't it at all (good chance the new fix actually makes things worse since
no one had the time to thing about the undesirable "side effects" of it).
Now, wash, rinse, repeat a time or two before everyone comes at least mildly
to their senses and says "wow - maybe we ought to step back a bit."

You see it in websites and other "OMG, lot's of people are seeing us down!"
situations.

My daughter was amazed the other night when she noticed during login that
another server (not ours) was down. She asked if Povar ever was locked -
lol. She's been playing about 4 months, and had seen an outage. She has
never crashed to the desktop (wish I could say the same). Her system crashed
to the desktop SEVERAL times the day after the last patch, but she didn't
happen to be around to see that (was my bazaar mule).

Fact is, SOE gets a "C+" to "B-" in my book for up time. If you think they
should "do better" - you're right. If you think they are completely
worthless and don't know what they are doing - why not try another game?
Because you're not going to get happy with them. They really do not do THAT
bad when you consider the number of servers, special cases, load, changes,
general complexity, etc., etc., etc..

JMHO.
