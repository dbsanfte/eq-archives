Found so far:

2.14     Q: What is the newest sever?

- What's a "Sever" ??  :P

and this one.....

A: Top posting is the act of posting your reply on top of quoted material,
rather than placing your response at the bottom of quoted material or
interspersed throughout it.  AGE is a newsgroup that on the whole feels
strongly
about top posting, and the feelings are not warm and fuzzy.  The topics of
discussion in AGE are often complex and wandering, and having to scroll to
the
bottom of a post to see what the heck a person is replying to is awkward and
annoying, and breaks the flow of the post.  You might prefer top posting and
that is your prerogative, but if you insist on using it here be prepared to
be
flamed and to land on a lot of Kill Files.  And please don't try to skirt
the
issue by just not quoting anything at all, either.  People are not going to
go
back through the thread playing detective to try to figure out what the heck
you're responding to.

Nothing really wrong with it but,  Sheesh, did I learn that the hard way or
what?
