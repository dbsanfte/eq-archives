OK. I would bet if it was an established pattern of behavior for a
character, VI would guess the intent and the DOT'er would still get in
trouble. I suspect maybe a warning first such that it would be suspended for
failing to comply with a GM.

If you<global vs you> kill several dozen people in the same manner, using
root/dot when a simple DD will do the job, it is obvious to me you are
looking to exploit the bug in DOT experience loss.
