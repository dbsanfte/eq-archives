I can't argue that. But remember the original developers left around
Velious so anything can happen down the road.

But does it have to be raid? I don't think so, I'd like to think the
developers will think of some other avenue. Unfortunately, you're probably
right.... with Raph in control I doubt any kind of breakthrough will occur.
It's just a wait and see till then.

True but you mentioned a duo, and I gave an example of my duo. A shaman and
rogue. I admit I wasn't clear about *concentration*. With other buffs you
can have more than five. On the flip side how many of those non
concentration buffs last longer than, say, two minutes? Not many - most
last long enough for a single fight. Kind of makes you think about that
raid content?
