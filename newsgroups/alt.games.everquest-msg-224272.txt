/agree

I seem to recall getting slammed pretty hard once for stating that I felt 
it was the cleric's duty to provide the dots whether they were being 
compensated or not. It's their spell, they should provide the reagents 
and should always have them on hand. 

As a cleric your friends should have no trouble taking care of you. If 
you're in a pickup group and it doesn't happen early, then you're in the 
wrong pickup group. Let them know that is costs money and jet if they 
don't fall in line.

I do feel the pain of those who get shafted, but holding out on a hugely 
beneficial buff for your groupmates when you have the means (and as I 
said, you should always have the means) is just as wrong IMO.
