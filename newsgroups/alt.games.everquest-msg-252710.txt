So why not just make it a tradeskill for all classes intead. Seems to me any
class could learn to look around in the woods for foraged goods just like
any class can learn to swim. Some classes would just get the headstart over
others and place some caps on it so for instance my chanter couldn't forage
as well as my ranger. That way anybody who wanted to spend ungodly hours
clicking on the forage button and waiting the endless time for it to refresh
would at least have the chance to do so.
