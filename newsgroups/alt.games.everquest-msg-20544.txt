I guess they figure it will take one of their grunt-level technicians about 10

================================================

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."

                   From "Travels with Charlie"
                   by John Steinbeck
