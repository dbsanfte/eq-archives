The newbie days can really be a pain if you just started out with your first
character and can't find anyone to be of assistance.  We all went through it
with our very first character.  Things get better though if you stick it
out.  If you are truly serious about playing the game, you may want to bite
the bullet and buy all 4 expansions (Kunark, Velious, Luclin, and Planes of
Power)  They can be purchased all at once from your local software vendor
and I would recommend buying all at once because it is truly the most
economical way to get them all (Everquest Gold is the name of the bundle
IIRC)   If you do purchase at least Luclin and PoP go to acrylia caverns in
Luclin and play there.  I have heard that this zone is fairly phenomonal exp
and decent loot as well.  When you get to your 30's you may want to travel
to Velious and hunt in Crystal Caverns.  Excellent loot, good exp until
level 50 or so (I still hunt there when I am short on cash with my 55
shaman)  After you get higher level you will be surprised just how much more
fun the game is.  Unfortunately the "old world" zones are not as good as the
expansion zones (in most cases) so if you really want to play, you have to
buy the expansions, but they are worth it IMO.
