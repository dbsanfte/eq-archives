Thats because if it went to litigation sony would lose (my legal opinion
only and im not a member of the bar )

Whether it has a net effect on the game I have never been able to decide.

I wish they would take away the very stupid no drop flag . It has grossly
effected prices on many things , while penalizing real players
substantially.
