    Yep.  When I read this tale of these two guys from One HOT druid all I
could think of is, wow, those guys sound really, really messed up.  I know
that I personally could care less if someone thinks I'm gay.  My sexual
preference is no one's business but my own and anyone I might try to
involve in it (which for the last two decades, pretty much, has just been
Lenny).  And I feel the same about other's sexuality as well.  

    Caring/obsessing about the real life genders of other online players is
just as baffling to me as I suppose the concept of male playing a female
was to these two in the example.
