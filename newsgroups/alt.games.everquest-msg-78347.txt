Your Divine gift for choosing the Warrior's path is a butt-load of hit
points.  Be very stingy with giving them out by covering them with as much
AC as you possibly can. If fighting solo (don't get too used to it) you will
appreciate the lessened downtime.  When grouped, your healer will appreciate
your HP thriftiness much more than whatever procs for you at Lvl 10.
