Hmm ... I don't have a real list. We checked different zones  in  
allakhazam.com. So I liked the fight againts Innoruuk in Nadox (Spawned it  
by accident when I was about lvl 65 with a friend ... And we got our  
revenge later ...)


Another fight I remember is Guardian of the Seal in The Hole.

I would recommend to check Allakhazam on your own. I was grouping with the  
same friend most of the time and these fights was lots of fun.

Me and my friends was never in PoTime so we had no ubber stuff (Ok - wie  
got some single OOW tier 1 stuff that are nice. And some DoN Augs + single  
DoD Rewards that are nice ... (WAR buffed at 9,2K HP)

We had pretty much problems in "newer" expansions. So a GoD named managed  
to wipe us while we killed a OOW named that has a higher level :)

All Pre PoP Expansions are nice to check. But boring to fight your way to  
a named first... :)

I am sure, that others think that our doing is "easy" or so because they  
have much better stuff. And I am sure, that you get much better drops in  
newer expansions with fights that are maybe easier or just a little  
harder. But I decided to do this stuff instead, because I hated all the  
overcrowded places. To many People act like idiots and I seem to have an  
affinity to them, because I regular meet them :(

(Just as an example: I was doing exp in Barindu. Easy to get to with WIZ.  
3boxing and 2 boxing in a group. We had our fun till a group of an "ubber  
guild" came. An epic mob is up and they wanted to kill it. At least they  
asked, if we want to kill that mob, too. When I answered, that we are just  
doing exp, they started to clear the area and also KSed us multiple times.
And that after I just started lesson on my toons :(
