i took my 34 druid there yesterday (wanted that spell haste 2 belt from
PoK for my enchanter.  i'm loving it ;) ).  i think her forage skill is
around 125 or so.  took me less than an hour to get one.  from what i
can tell, foraging is just a luck-of-the-rng type thing.  i've also
heard that yew leaves are ground spawn that look like little clovers.  i
didn't see any of these, although i really only left the zonewall twice.
once to cross from the south edge of the zone to the north, and another
to go around some dragon that was hanging out on the north edge.  when i
finally got it, i was on the west side of the zone near skyshrine.
don't know if that has any bearing at all on chances to forage it.

on another note: it actually took longer to get a twilight orchid out of
maiden's eye than it did to get the yew leaf out of WL.

that probably doesn't help, given the nature of foraging, but oh well :P
