That's where we were headed, actually, but we stopped at the
lower corner so that the puller (me, actually) could pull the
upper left "plaza" section clear before everyone moved up
into it.

That's when The Incident occurred.

That's what we thought.  I even conned it as it wandered
off and got a "scowls at you, ready to attack -- what would
you like your tombstone to say" message, so it's not like
he was non-KoS to the rest of us for any reason.

We kept waiting for him to come back with a train of
his friends, but he never did.

And the bard swears he was only playing the group-only
mana song, no AoE of any sort.
