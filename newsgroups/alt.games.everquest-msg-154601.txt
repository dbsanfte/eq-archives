Thanks a lot dstep, all much appreciated not least the time taken to give
such a full reply.

I agree wholeheartedly with you about the old world, although I'm not that
taken with Luclin. My whole purpose in making an iksar was to discover far
more of Kunark than I've ever explored before with other races. Once I get
to the Bazaar, however, I will spend some time looking at a few Luclin zones
although my shaman, necro  and druid have done a few. The main problem with
them (especially solo) is that the mobs hit far harder than in corresponding
old world zones for the same loot and exp.

Thanks again :).
