Make sure you have the very latest DX9 (DX9.0b iirc).

I was having some problems after the last patch and since my system is
a little over a month old, I though all the drivers were current, (I am
religious about fully updating drivers, just too many problems from
slightly out of date drivers). Last weekend I decided to get the latest
security patches and saw it wanted me to update DX9 also.

I have not seen any problems since, although to be honest, I've not been
playing much lately.
