I have a warrior (level 16) and I make it a point to never beg for SoW, 
etc. If he needs to go from Kaladim to Qeynos, I do it the hard way. I'll 
pay for a teleport if someone is headed that way but other than that I do 
it myself. I'm proud of that. Might be slow, but I get to see a lot of the 
world that way.
