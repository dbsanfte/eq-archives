due to some lucky flagging and a modest time grinding, i have 9 aa's saved
up on my 65 enc

and!

to dc or not to dc is my question....i know only a handful of people here
have DC, so rather than just ask for their opinions, i'd like to present all
the info i have, and ask that anyone with the time to look it over will be
able to help me make a decision:

***reasons to not get DC:
-a lvl 46 pet can't do diddly when you're 65
-those 9 aa's would be better spent getting animation empathy
-lots of silly reasons that combine the above two
-the DC pet is a joke compared to a regularly-charmed pet (in terms of DPS)
-soloing xp mobs with a dc pet wouldn't work....regular charm would make DC
a wasted skill
-Sage sounds less cool than Master (this is real reason for me...i didn't
spend my 6th aa until i was ready to quickly churn out 12 aa's for Master)
-being unable to zone, or only doing so once an hour

***reasons to get DC:
-a DC pet is much safter than a charmed one
-in zones with lvl 50-ish mobs, the DC pet is king (and you'll end up in
kael or old seb again sometime soon, right?)
-the DC pet beats the animation:
--DC pet will have much much much more HP
--a lvl 46 mob will usually quad for 150-ish, and the animation tops out at
around quads for 65 (but the dc pet won't enrage, if that matters)

-DC would enable the 65 enc to solo just about all his shards for VT
-the enchanter would be capable of going AFK for more than 1 second at a
time
-because wtf else is there to get as an enc? nuke crits? MGB and LR5 are all
you need to raid....what now?
-so the enchanter can go indisguise as a mage with monster summoning!
-IIRC, DC'ing the chickens in tov will turn things around quickly (didn't i
hear something like that? i never did that fight in tov anyway, i'm just
trying to quote from memory)
-useful for powerleveling (i wont be powerleveling anymore, since i can't
multibox [anymore])



so, please feel free to weigh in.....i also have some questions that i know
have been asked before, but all the conflicting information (read: people
who don't know spouting off) has confusitated me:

~ can DC be resisted? (if so, will it reset instantly?)
~ what happens if i target a mob higher than 46 and click DC? (do i get a
message that it won't work, or will that mob just aggro me?) (also, does it
reset if used?)
~ what happens to the mob next to the mob that i DC? does DC cause the
neighbor to aggro?
~ what factors haven't i thought of, above?
~ if a DC'd pet has a cancel-magic-type spell cast upon it, can DC be
broken?
~ safe to assume that invis cast upon me will break the DC ?


thanks in advance
