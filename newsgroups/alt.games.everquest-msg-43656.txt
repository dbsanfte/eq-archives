Your point? So we both mentioned it.

My graphics card is just fine, thank you. And while 128 mb is "not very
impressive" it's well above the stated minimums for the game. But that
wasn't the reason anyway. (See below)

Nope. A little more testing, using both of our primary machines,
resulted in finding where the problem lies. Our other computer is even
"less impressive" than the one I was on for that test. (only 64 mb)
However, logging on a character in another realm, the motion was almost
smooth and flawless. Same on my machine. The difference? It was a human
character, down closer to the ground. The first one I created was a
Troll Viking, with the "tallest" attribute selection. From that far off
the ground, the motion is jerkey and difficult to control. More normal
sized characters can be steered much more easily and smoothly. This
needs to be fixed if they are going to continue to allow the option of 8
plus feet tall trolls.
