Ah, but that's not a 'quest'... that's just begging for leftovers... and I
could do that with any lowbie in almost any zone (although I might not live
long in some of them) :o)

... and as for selling them in the Bazaar... that would make it a loot
quest, and not a very good one (just cuz they're PRICED at 150, doesn't mean
they're selling for that much) ;o)
