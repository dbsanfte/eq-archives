  Darn.  Not only do I have a lousy newsreader (heh), but my ISP's news
server is the pits.  I didn't get the message you replied to, and I
can't get any messages more than 2 or 3 days old.  It's about the only
ISP in my area with a local access number, too. :\  Guess that's what I
get for living out in the sticks.

  I think I've tracked down a newsreader that supports superseding.  I
guess I can just use it whenever I notice a glaring flaw in a post I
make, and use NS the rest of the time.  Or maybe I'll like this
newsreader enough to leave Netscape entirely, though I kind of doubt
it... I still need an e-mail client, heh.
