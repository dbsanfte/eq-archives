I solo all my characters in PC up to level 24, against the various mobs 
including the fiends.  Some can cure disease, some can't, I just bandage 
up if need be, and keep at it.  I've only died to it once.  You can, 
however, go kill the Shriknar in PC without fear of getting the crud, 
once you are high enough level.  Until then, there should still be 
mushrooms that are at least blue to you.
