From http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/upcoming_updates.jsp

   Looks like there are some interesting thing upcoming.  The following is cut
and paste of what I thought were the biggest changes, the link above gives more
changes about font changes and damage shield messages and whatnot.

cut 'n paste

Targeting - Sometimes it can be difficult to tell which NPC you have targeted.
With the next update we hope to add a targeting indicator of some sort
(something like the ring that surrounds your target in EQOA). The exact form
hasn't been decided, but the goal is to make seeing what you currently have
targeted much easier. 

Consider - Along the same lines as the proposed improvement to targeting, we
want to add a way to distinguish the /con color of your target. We plan an
indicator that will be easily distinguished once you have a target (probably
someplace in the Target window), that should remove the need to use the /con
command. 

---

/tell windows - It is very easy to lose /tells in the confusion of combat. We
want to add an option that would work much like an instant messenger. Each time
you get a "tell" from a new character, a new chat window would open. That window
will only display "tells" from the particular character, and any message sent
from the chat window would automatically be sent as a "tell" to that character.
Obviously this would be an optional feature. 

Help for new players - New characters will start with a bag. This will give them
a little more storage space and the opportunity to learn how storage containers
work earlier rather than later. We are also working on removing one of the more
tedious "features" of the game, the need to practice Sense Heading. Most folks
have that skill mapped to trigger along with one of their movement keys. Not an
exciting skill to practice. So we plan to have all characters start with a 200
skill in Sense Heading. This will allow new players to navigate more easily, and
will reduce a bit of tedium over the course of gameplay. 

</cut 'n paste>

    I'm not real sure how I feel about all this.  Yes, it all sounds very
convenient.  But the game is getting more and more nudged away from the game I
started playing.  I've said before that I am in favor of losing some of the more
tedious features of the Vision, but still, there are times when I miss the days
when things felt harder.
