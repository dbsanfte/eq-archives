Actually modern prayer is for you. it was only particular people who
"walked with God" in the bible who directly had something come of
prayers.

God isn't a genie, so prayer in that sense is futile. That kind of
prayer is just tossed about by charlatans, such as Benny Hinn.

Regular prayer is stuff like "grant me the strength to accept this",
rather than "Heal my amputated leg and let me win the lottery
tomorrow." Or most prayers fall under the "forgive me for my sins, in
the name of Jesus Christ" category.

I think most modern answering of prayer is coincidence. The plane had
turbulence, I prayed, we landed okay.. etc. You'd have to compare that
with how many planes had turbulence where no one prayed yet they still
landed okay.

God was mentioned as omniscient, but people still have free will. He
knows what you will do, but maybe even God hopes he might be wrong
or is just not pleased when it happens.
The way I think of it is you watching that episode of your favorite
show, where it went sour and started to suck. You've seen that episode
like 50 times, you know what is going to happen, yet somehow you hope
it is different. Or perhaps God is only omniscient when he wants to
be, making things more exciting.
