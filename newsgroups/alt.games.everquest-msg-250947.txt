In instances like this I could assume the poster is either... (and I
could be wrong)

1. A friend of someone who plays EQ way too much.  They have long since
lost much contact with this friend since they spend a lot of time
playing EQ, so they chose to find all the EQ posting areas that they
can and post how disgusted they are about how their friend won't come
hang out with them anymore because of the game.

2. He quit EQ long ago, or recently, and goes around expressing his
hate for the game.  If he can't enjoy the game, why should anyone else?
We're all a bunch of idiots for playing a game he doesn't like!

3. He's a part of the Spouses Against Everquest group at Yahoo.
