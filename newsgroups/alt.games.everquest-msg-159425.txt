OK so I finally broke down and bought a horse for my cleric, as I was tired
of the routine: Stand, CH, Sit, Die, especially in a situation where there
are many adds and your group doesn't have the proper crowd control.  Now I
can always stand and get mana regen the same as I was sitting, and this
makes 2 boxing a little easier as I now longer have to click sit/stand each
time now.

Here is my question.  I tried to do a player-player transfer while on
horseback, and I couldn't give my cleric the items until I dismounted.  I
didn't try too long, but is this the case?  Do I need to dismount to do
transfers?

Thanks, Danny
