I guess I don't see what you're complaining about...

As example, under old xp rules, people moved from avocets in SK to gnolls
in splitpaw around 27. Under the new rules, they could maybe camp avocets
til 30ish and still get decent xp. Of course, under the new rules, they'd
still get *much* better xp moving to splitpaw at 27. So under the new
rules, just like under the old ones, lazy or risk-averse players will still
xp slower than ambitious or aggressive players. This is a bad thing how
exactly??

Besides, how much /ooc heckling do you think it would take for an untwinked
group of level 24s to cause a group of level 30s to slink away in shame?

Good thing you're running a class that solos well, eh?

Roleplaying choice? A wisdom uber alles philosophy? Perhaps some folks
need to reevaluate their gearing strategies since the "38 cleric with KEI"
is no longer a staple of their usual group?

That's pretty much my philosophy as well. It's too bad that on Xev,
at the times I play, the LFG tools have yet to reach critical mass
for the under 40 crowd.
