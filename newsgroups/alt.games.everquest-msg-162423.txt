I always feel guilty when the tanks thank me for healing them.
Healing in my *job*, just as stopping the MOBs from
beating on everybody else is the tank's job. The group is
snafu if *either* of us mess up.

A tank can shine as well. It's just one of those things that
nobody notices happening. The cleric is pleasantly surprised
that they only have one person to heal. The chanter is happy
that their mezzed MOBs stay that way. The wizard is
happy that they can wave-hands-MOB-goes-BOOM and
not get attacked as a result. And so on.

But the poor warrior rarely gets a word of praise for it.
(This applies to the other tanking classes too, of course,
but warriors are particularly hard-done-by.)

...and of course in the event of a disaster often the warrior
is the first one to die.

        ...Ronny

(who mostly plays a cleric, has never played a warrior, but
sees it as a thankless and boring job which is vastly
unappreciated.)
