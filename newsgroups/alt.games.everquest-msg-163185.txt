The INT and Mana on this item would make it an "ok" item for a middle
level necro if it weren't for the fact that it's 2HB. Therefore, the
user has to give up holding anything in the secondary. There are so many
combinations of 1 handed primary and secondary items that will result in
a net greater INT and Mana which are obtainable at the same level and/or
cheaply bought in the bazaar, that the value of the staff is dropped to
virtually nothing.

The clickable effect is a spell that any necro who'd be weilding it can
already cast. So the only point when you'd need to would be an "Oh Shit!
OOM" type thing, and even then by the time you swapped it out of your
bag and into your primary slot to click on it, you'd likely be dead
anyway.

Sell it to a vendor or to a noobie for fifty plat or so, I'd say.
