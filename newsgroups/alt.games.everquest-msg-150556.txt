Warrior goes in first, uses ae taunt, doesnt turn attack on.  Hes now got
agro and can be consta healed, while the mob is debuffed.  The mob isnt in
summon mode, so clerics and debuffers are totally safe.

Thats better than current.. but the mob can still be gimped before you all
engage..  if warrior is low/clerics lom, the warrior can just jump out of
battle and the mob can't do anything.

Imo as soon as a mob is "engaged" or cast on, if hes perma rooted he should
insta summon.

Would be funny to see guilds try and kill the mobs ungimped for once too :)

So like I said, when you can gimp mobs.. why even bother forcing guilds to
do it first?  Make every rooted mob 60% slower, perma tashed, crippled, then
make it immune to those spells..  its gimp either way
