If you get a wiz port to N.Karana, once you're there, just follow the river.
It will head South, then curve off to the West.
Follow the river, and the only mobs you should meet are 2 camps of raiders
or bandits.  They aren't too difficult to avoid if you keep your eyes open.
The river will take you through West Karana.

Once you reach Villiage McManus at the far end of WKarana, head north along
the zoneline.  You should reach a canyon that will take you to the Qeynos
Hills.  From there, head Southward, and you're in Qeynos.

Only mobs you'll have to worry about in WKarana are if someone's trained
bandits, Ogres, or swarmlings to the WK/QH zoneline.  That, and if it's
night, there's a werewolf that will sometimes spawn near that zoneline as
well.
