At the lower levels you need to tank/melee the mob along with your pet.
This will help raise your defence skills, this will help you in the long
run.
Get some armor even cloth or raw silk will help, check the bazaar and
save up every copper. When you get to about level 25-30 your tanking days
will be over.

Make sure you train in the meditate skill, you get it at level 4.

You should let the pet tank a little while you throw a spell or 2 and
then you tank a little.

Ideally after a battle you want to be at half mana, and half hit points
on you and your pet. This way when you sit down you you are regenerating
your health and mana and your pet is regenerating its health. Just a few
minutes recovering and then you are on to your next mob.

When you are tanking turn the mob so that your pet is beating on its back.
Their AC is lower from the rear and Mobs cannot dodge, parry, or riposte
attacks on their rear.

Make sure you get the spell Banshee Aura when you reach that spell level.
Its a personal damage shield that damages the mob every time it hits you.
Its very mana efficient way of doing a lot of damage.

When you look for item upgrades go for items with +HP on them, HP for
a necro are mana since they get hp-mana conversion spells. This will also
help you tank. Many cheap items in the bazaar now.
