I sort of figure the Goddess is a fan of chaos mathematics and
fractals, and she designed DNA as a chemical/biological statement of
an evolving fractal equation and set it loose to see what it would do.

Throw enough chaos into the mix and you don't know what you'll end up
with, but it will be interesting to watch regardless.

Plus it allows very neatly for evolution.
