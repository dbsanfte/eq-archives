Now that they have the economic resources and political position to
do so.  Many of the old guard in the Israeli establishment were
terrorists or supporters of terrorists in their younger days.

That's rather debatable.

The Israelis have been ill-treated by the Arabs, but they're far
from pure in either motives or deeds.  The people who got royally
screwed were the non-Jewish Palestinians, who had little to begin
with and have been (ab)used as pawns in that mess for the last
half-century.  Nobody, not even the Israelis, has gotten a good
deal in the Mideast.  And I also don't see any faction there that
has any strong basis for claiming to have behaved righteously,
very definitely including outside factions in Europe, Asia, and
the US.
