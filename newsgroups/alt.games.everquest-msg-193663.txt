Sorry, I wasn't implying that they couldn't. But strafe running isn't
really a viable option for opening up enough room between you and a
mob to root it without getting hit. You either need snare or
sow/jboots for that. Or you just channel your root while getting beat
on. .

Granted, if you have room to maneuver, it works well even w/o sow for
a wizard. Even with the occasional resist on root you can take the
some hits while channeling root. But now try it in a packed dungeon
like Runnyeye or Permafrost where you just don't have the room to
maneuver. My warrior twink literally killed non-stop in Perma, with at
least 2 mobs agro'd all the time so I didn't have to worry about
runners. 

 Or try it with a wizard in close quarters against a red con where 2
resisted roots can get me killed in seconds if I don't have room to
maneuver with a serious speed advantage over the mob. 

My hat is off to all the wizards that lvled to 60 without KEI, I did
it with a shaman but just wouldn't have the patience to ever do it
with a wizard.
