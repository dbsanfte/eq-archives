    I second this one. The brutes are even or lower at 25, spawn fast, don't
seem to path out of the caves (so unless you get trained you never see
anything but non-assisting apes), and the cash drops are actually
exceptional. The majority of the apes will drop almost a plat in coin and
either a gem from the Topaz/Jade/Ivory/Pearl/Amber table or a Gold
Ring/Silver Amulet/Mithril Earring/Jade Earring table item. I was amazed at
how much those sold for when I took my shaman back to Grobb to train up
Specialization and Alchemy.
