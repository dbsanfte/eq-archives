When the client submits a name for approval to the server, the server
checks to see if it is available on that server and is not prohibited by
the name filters.  If a GM is on, the GM is also told about the name,
and given a chance to reject it.  If the GM does nothing, the name is
accepted.

That is sometimes the reason a name is rejected several times and then
accepted--you finally got a GM who didn't object, or tried when the GM
was not on.
