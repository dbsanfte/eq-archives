ATI has 10% better hardware and 25% crappier drivers.  ATI will release one
updated software driver per every five Nvidia releases.  If that.

Also, ATI releases one card per two from Nvidia, though it doesn't matter
much if you're going to buy right *now*.  That means in a few months when
Nvidia releases their next-gen card, ATI won't have a new release (or will
release a re-packaged card using the same chip as the current one, just
overclocked).

In 2d work (video editing) you won't be able to tell the difference
probably.

I'm happy with my Geforce card.  I've got friends happy with their ATI
cards.  I do think ATI cards handle the particle engine a bit better than
Geforce cards, so if you're one of those masochists who keeps the worst
example of "art" ever to be produced by Sony turned on you may prefer the
ATI.  Otherwise performance will til toward the Geforce in my experience.

One more thing.  ATI performance isn't as tied to CPU power as Geforce is. 
Meaning a slower CPU won't hurt the ATI card's performance as much, but a
faster CPU won't improve it as much either.
