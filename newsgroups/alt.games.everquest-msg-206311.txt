Now that the user interface uses those wonderful and powerful XML interface,
I was wondering about the potential use for automation.

For instance... I have a warrior that sometimes I use for pulling. When I am
bringing in a MOB I will tell my group one of three different fun little
incoming messages. I mean, it is a game and should be fun, right?

I have three Hot buttons set up each with it's incoming message. Is there a
way using XML to set up a fourth button, for instance, that will generate a
random number between one and three and then fire off the appropriate
incoming message?

Thanks,

D
