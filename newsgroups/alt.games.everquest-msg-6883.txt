You think thats bad, try being a Rogue.

In the normal course of things, the spinning to face you can cause you to lose
backstabs.   And sometimes when mobs run, they don't run straight, but because
of some pathing or whatever, they will run a few steps, turn around, run a few
back, turn around, run a few more, ad nauseum...   makes it *really* hard to
get a backstab in when it's facing a different direction every time someone
hits it.
