One interesting side-note to this thread.  I was in Paineel once and got
to see a GM resolve a dispute between two players fighting over the
guards there.  One player complained that he was camping the guards
before the other got there.  The GM explained that camps are not
officially recognized.  He also said that the other player had the
right to kill guards "as long as he was getting exp for them."  Finally,
he told the two to share the guards (at which point the "first" player
stormed off, furious).

This leads me to believe that the GMs might frown on high level
characters farming HGs if they no longer get any exp for them.  As
long as they are light blue, it is share and share alike.  You do have a
legitimate complaint if they are killing ALL of them and not letting
anyone else get any.  If this is happening, and they won't stop when you
ask them nicely, I would /petition.
