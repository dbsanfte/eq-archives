I'm kind of getting there now, being a member of a raiding guild that might
not be uber now but with big ambitions, but I've always enjoyed seeing the
cool stuff people have gotten in encounters way above my current abilities,
even when I was a lowly unguilded chanter on my old server.

People don't become uber to spite you, and all of us like to tell of whatever
feats we've managed lately, no matter how uber or not those may be.
