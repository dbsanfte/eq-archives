Barbarian shaman in Halas and a human monk in Qeynos can get together
quite soon.  The newbie area of Everfrost lets you get to level 5 in
an evening easily.  Your ready for Blackburrow then.  I haven't tried
a monk to know how fast they level in Qeynos, but a friend leveled to
6 in one evening.  No idea whether that's fast or slow for a monk
character.
