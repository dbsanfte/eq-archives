Actually, there is a big scam going around. Read these for more
info.

And boy is Yantis mad

  The gist I get of it is that some dude is "offering" a
discreet, free email service to EQ players.  Using the questions
he asks at account start up, he hacks into EQ and _Paypal_ (!)
accounts.  I read the links and am a bit confused on a point...
there is talk that no one should ever give out one's eq password
and such, but other posters are saying that the scammer isn't
asking for eq information... he's getting access by asking for
the mark's birthday and email address supplied to SOE, and then
requesting a new password.  Or something.  I admit, I didn't
really study the links, just gave them a quick read through.

   And yes, Yantis does seem to be very mad indeed.  He's done
research on the scammer that makes Bizbee's google searches on
new trollers seem very feeble in comparison.  Dunno _why_ the
mysupersales man is pissed to the tune of offering a $10,000
dollar (not plat.... Dollar!) reward.
