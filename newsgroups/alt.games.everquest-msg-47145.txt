I just hit 35 last night HHOOOOOOZAAHHHH  - yeah, you just sit down now,
don't need to stare at the book unless you're like actually swapping out
spell gems or rearranging it.

Right - med won't raise if you're not sitting (35+) or actively staring at
that damnedable book (pre35).

I was a little worried last night as I just SAT down.  Sat watching the chat
box....nothing...jeesh I was almost out fully OOM, still nothing....You have
gotten better at meditate! X

So, my observation thus far, sitting IS meditating (35+)
