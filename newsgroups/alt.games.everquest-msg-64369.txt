My mate and I were frustrated today at the problems with the patching and so
forth, like most of us...  This brought back memories of a SNL episode
hosted by William Shatner where they do a take off of the geeks that attend
Star Trek Conventions.  I don't know if you know the episode, but basically
during a Q and A, Shatner gets fed up and says to the crowd in not so many
words...  Why don't you all go get a life?

We began laughing about possible messages that Verant could put up while the
servers are down.  We came up with:

"Yes the Servers are still down!  Go Outside Dammit!  The Sunshine will do
you good!"

Of course we are among all of the other rabid players that have not seen the
light of day recently...  LOL  Just like I was at one point among those
geeks that went to Trek conventions...  sigh...
