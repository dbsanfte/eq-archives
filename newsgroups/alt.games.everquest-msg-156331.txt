Id say 70%+ of mobs aren't just agro and turning tail to camp

Why would I be better?   Statue doesn't hit for more than his max versus any
class.. if I were playing a wizard for the pull Id have been hit for just
the same, 1100 1100 etc...  only difference would be total HP

No, it would resolve monks from the horrible nerf they've just been gimped

It would force VI to resolve the AC PROBLEMS (with ANY high level
ranger/rogue/monk) not a problem with monks

The chances of death have increased drastically.  Hes still the same old
regular boring pull, I just get to die more now.  Gee what a fun challenge
that adds to the game!
