You may (or may not) be surprised how many people choose insecure
name/password combos.

I bet there are lots of marilyn/manson, perfect/circle, dragon/ballz,
harry/potter type station name/password combos.

Being a Sys Admin, I learned everyone's passwords in the office. So many
people chose the same ones it was eerie. The most popular password was
favoriteplace-yearvisited (canada87, paris99, etc.)
