Try Hailing every Non-Player Character (NPC) you see.
Some will answer your hails with a sentence containing words in [brackets].
Replying with a sentence containing that word,      e.g What [word],  
will get you more detail - what you have to collect or deliver, who or what you
have to kill etc.

Start with the NPC's in your guild house.

Try   http://everquest.allakhazam.com/
look under quests for your starting city and try a couple of the appropriate
lvl you should get the hang of it pretty quickly.
