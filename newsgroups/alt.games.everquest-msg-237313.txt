Despite my misgivings about replying to this likely troll...

First time I ever heard of someone getting upset about someone making the 
rather silly decision to turn in the book.  He was just an idiot, and has 
nothing to do with being a Druid.

On a blue server, what the red book means is that you will never get a 
group (at least not with anyone that knows any better), you cannot 
recieve or cast spells on other players unless they are also red, or I 
assume, in an arena or a duel.  This means that you can't even be healed 
in a group.  Basically, you will be playing solo from now on, or until 
you get a GM to switch you back (unless they finally added a quest to do 
it).

There are not enough red players on any given blue server to have any 
point to doing it.  If you really want to play PvP, you ought to play on 
a PvP server.
