Couple of semi-related things in the FAQ:

===================================================
How will I know the number of groups that a raid is intended for?

In the case of instanced events, you will be told either by a character in
game or through some other means how many groups can enter the pocket zone
where the encounter takes place. For contested boss fights in open areas, an
icon next to the name of the boss will tell you the size of the raid force
that is allowed to attack it. If you try to attack the encounter with a
force larger than intended, you will be unable to lock the encounter or do
damage to it; however, the opponent can attack and kill you at will.
Attempts to cheat are therefore discouraged.

How long will raids typically last?

Instanced raid encounters are designed to fit within the casual gamer's
schedule, lasting an average of two to three hours.  Instanced raid zones
represent a longer time commitment and are designed to be played in
four-hour to six-hour blocks on a weekend.
===================================================

One of the themes emerging from this game design is the idea that by
controlling very tightly some of the more dynamic elements of encounters,
effective and enduring balance through precise tuning is more easily
achieved. This has some real downsides (as Ben Sisson points out) from the
standpoint of diminishing an immersive worldview, but it's also got some
upside potential if it really results in presenting consistent, worthy
challenge for teams of all sizes. Some element of surprise and discovery is
forfeited, but these "discoveries" usually apply only to the first groups in
the game to achieve them and then once they're posted on the net they become
common knowledge anyway.

After living with the EQ experience for almost 6 years now, I'm ready to try
a new approach and see how well it all balances out.
