<shrug>  What's fair?  The screams of whining have mainly been by people
that call ANY objection a whine.  If that's unfair, they seem to be unfair
to everyone equally at least.

I guess the only thing *I* would call unfair are the people that assumed I
was just another Class Envy screamer that would be unwilling to even listen.
One of the ones that screams about his one issue, doesn't care what everyone
says, and then dissapears when he's treated like a Troll.  I don't really
fit that description, but if I object to it very strongly I tend to fit in
to it, so I'm kind of defenseless on that one.

Sure, my view is definitely unpopular, not many people have stepped up to
defend me and everyone sure jumped in quick enough to call me a port whore,
but I was kind of hoping that by not flaming back I could outlast them.

I guess by some standards it's been unfair, but this IS usenet, you hardly
EXPECT fair here.

Well, now... This isn't quite true, or at least it wasn't when I CREATED my
Druid.

When I installed EQ and read the manual, Druids were described as the BEST
travellers in the game.  The exact words were something like "No class can
get from point A to Point B as well as a Druid".  Ports used to be ONLY a
Druid spell.  It was given to Wizzies because (according to VI) they were
afraid there wouldn't be enough Druids to carry people around.

After Kunark and Velious, Mobs were put in that had FAR too many hit points
for the Wizzies usual burn, and who also had massive magic resistance.  The
value of Wizards was reduced as a result, and they had always had a
legitimate complaint in that they were TOO specialized.  The could only
BURN.  Granted they did that VERY well, but when the massive HP and Magic
Resistance reduced that value, the Wizzies started having trouble.

That's when VI gave them TL's, and the Planes Ports.  Basically, they handed
them what had been the linchpin of the Druid Franchise, Travel.  Ports
aren't just another thing Druids are second best at, they are our defining
ability.   It wasn't that imbalancing for us to be second best a lot AND
have a defining ability, because ports were an out-of-combat utility, of
limited use in groups.

The other thing I don't understand here is why when people say they built a
MULE, just to port around their Guildmates, and complain about the PoK, they
get sympathy.

The only difference between MY Druid, and the one others are saying they
made to port their guild around, is that I MADE MINE AS MY MAIN!  The ENTIRE
reason I chose a Druid for my main character is that I wanted to be able to
port my guild around to different places.  I chose to do ALL the time what
others are saying they created a mule for.

And yet, when they complain that their MULE lost his ability, everyone is
sympathetic, and when I complain about the same thing with my MAIN, I get
flamed intensely.  Where's the difference?  I honestly wanted to be a porter
for my Guild FULL TIME, not just park my character after his third set of
ports, an pull him out before raids to get everyone together.

So, they get sympathy for losing a part time mule, while I get flamed when I
was doing the same thing full time?  Huh?
