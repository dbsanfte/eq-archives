Proposed Loot division solution. (At least weapons)

disclaimer - I've never played EverQuest. BUT i think I can propose a
solution to the problem which is this - the group stumbles over some
valuable item somehow and has to see who gets it. what to do?

IF the item is a weapon here's my proposal. I call it Group Bump.

each group member has items of armour or weaponry whose effectiveness
can be described as a scalar number. make lists of these for the whole
group, one for each item. then sort this list by the effectiveness
number, where people with equal items are also rated by seniority.

Suppose the group acquires a powerful sword. under Group Bump rules,
the sword goes to the highest person on the sword list who's sword is
rated below the found sword. then, that person previous sword is
bumped down to the person next on the list, and THAT person's sword
goes to the person below them etc.

That way, everyone gets an upgrade, or at least another sword as good
as their own.

this rule can be applied to anything that can be sorted into a list.
The absolute rule is no one ever winds up with an item WORST then the
one they already have.

This sounds like a hassle, but it is something that could be easily
coded into the game.

what are your feelings on this?
