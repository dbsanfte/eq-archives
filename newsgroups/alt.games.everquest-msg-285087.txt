The formula doesn't seem to give DPS, just a good comparison factor. 
Your actual DPS with the weapon will vary wildly based on your skill at 
the weapon type (1hb for the mace, 2hb for the staff, most likely), your 
attack rating (which again varies with skill, but also with such factors 
as your str and offense skill, and buffs that directly affect attack), 
your haste % and the mob's AC and other defensive abilities, so on and 
so forth.

All things being equal (attacking the same mob with the same gear and 
buffs on and the same skill in the weapon) the "magic number" the 
formula Don gives here will tell you which weapon will do more damage on 
average.

BUT even if the "magic number" for the staff is better than that of the 
mace, thats not the whole story.  Since the staff is a two handed 
weapon, this means you don't get to put anything in your secondary slot. 
  For a class which can dual weild, this means giving up a fairly 
substantial second source of damage, for one that can't, it still means 
giving up stats of an offhand item, and possibly Bash, which is damage 
and a chance of interrupting spells.  If two weapons have identical 
Magic Numbers, then the one handed one is your best pick most of the 
time (unless the two hander has stats on it so good that they're better 
than both the one hander and whatever you'd put in the off hand, or has 
a proc you really like, or something)

Another concern here with the fiddly details of this post; as a rule, 
the slower the weapon, the higher the damage bonus.  At low levels, this 
can be too "grainy" to see; the 20 delay weapon has a 2 bonus and the 36 
delay one might be calculated at 2.5... but rounded down to 2.  When 
you're up at a 10 damage bonus for the mace, though, the damage bonus 
for the staff might be 12.5 rounded to 12.  In particular, weapons with 
a delay over 40 often get a substantial boost to damage bonus.  This, in 
turn, means that the mace may never end up being better than the staff, 
in terms of raw magic number.  I'd have to see the math to know, though, 
as I'm not sure at all how the progression of damage bonus goes.

Yet another thought; at low levels, the mace is superior to the staff, 
because there's a damage cap.  At the very low end, no weapon will do 
more than 20 damage (a hair higher if you have a high str, but for 
comparison purposes that part doesn't matter).  That is to say, you can 
treat all weapons as having at most a 10 damage, regardless of their 
delay.  So a 30/40 weapon is, practically speaking, a 10/40 weapon, and 
your 10/20 weapon would be much better than that.  This part may be 
irrelevant by the time you get a damage bonus, as I think the cap is 
pretty much gone by then, and even at lower levels, the cap comes 
partway off, so that the 20 damage of your staff probably all counted.. 
but that hypothetical 30/40 weapon.

Fun stuff eh?
