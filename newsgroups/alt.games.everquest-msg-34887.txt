Basically in the warrens, but I don't think it raises merchants. Your
bad faction is part of your necroness with that race. Basically as a
necro, you are are an enemy of everyone in Erudin city sort of and
lucky they all don't kill you.

Its not really worth it. Erudin merchants, for example, is one of the
hardest factions to raise. There are basically 2 ways to raise it and
you probably can't do either of them. One is collecting odus pearls
from the head guy at pally guild, who I bet does not like you at all
(if you even live near him) The other is in west freeport at the
hogcallers inn upstairs, there is a human guy in a room.. he is the
one in a room near that dwarf standing there (dwarf is for another
quest) you give the human lanterns (can't remember if small, think
regular) you can get from several vendors around freep ( I found some
in the Jade bar or something in north freeport.. probabably some
closer) and he gives you some resin wood chips or something that stack
(and it raises all of the Wood elf factions that the muffin quest to
that dwarf near him raises) then you go and give those to emil parsini
back in toxula forest and it raises merchants of erudin. Its about the
only good way to raise it too, my wood elf druid got it from glower
dubious to amiable pretty fast that way (of course she can gate and
port)

As I said though, its not worth it. Instead, as my erud Sk of cazic
found out, you may just want to go to freeport. Oddly enough she was
hated in erudin and even around the qeynos area. At level 6 she got a
camo from a hobbit and ran through rivervale (dying once, then made it
second time ) then got bound by someone in east freeport. She could
train in the east freep sewer as necros can. The cool thing though was
that, I guess since so far away, the freeport people liked her
actually. She conned from apprehensive to amiable with most of them
(amiable to most of the merchants) and was even only glower dubious to
the north freeport paladins.

I'm not sure if the erud necro of cazic is similar, but if it is and
you can manage it, getting a port to WC or something then a bind in
west or east freep would be easier than trying to raise erud or qeynos
factions.
