Ah. There you go.  Never used it during battle, just used it to
attempt to escape when my pet *was* dead and I was next. :)

I always use snare on whatever I'm pulling, so I make sure I'm just
within spellcasting distance, and when fear breaks and it heads for
me, I just back up a few steps real quick and cast fear again, and
when fear is resisted, well, then I FD for a minute until my pet gets
the aggro back
