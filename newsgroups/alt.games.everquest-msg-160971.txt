Have them behind each other not side by side.   The less updates/refreshes
the "inactive" screen does, the better your overall performance will be.

And if you want a performance increase...
Make a copy of your EQ directory
Make a new icon on your desktop for this second copy
In the second EQ directory make a file called "nosound.txt"
Turn everything off on the bot character.. clip pane down, /showsp off,
/serverfilt on /show gr
The old UI is a lot faster too, if you can bear switching back

Yes it does mean you have to update both copies come patchday, but with
cable/dsl thats not a problem

Read up on EQW too, cuz theres an eqw.ini with settings you can change for
optimisation
