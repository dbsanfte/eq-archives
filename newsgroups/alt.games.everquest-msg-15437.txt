<request for good weapon and armour for a necro>

Unless you're a shaman, pet casters don't need to melee.  Period.  Your pet
*is* your armor and weapon.  If you're a necro and you've been going toe to
toe with a mob, you're doing things the hard way.  You should realize that
by the time you're lvl 16+ your best bet is to wraggle your fingers from
afar while your loyal pet keeps the mob busy.  With that said, at this point
you should try to get a group together and hit befallen for your dagger of
marnek and stuff.  You should also invest in a stein of Mogguk(?)(damn I
always feel like I'm misspelling that name), it will add 10 to your int for
around 100-200 pp.  So, with that in your off-hand, you can pick up a
Dragoon dirk or somesuch for some extra int umph.

But that's about it.  You're not a tank mage, you're a dealer of magical
death.  Act like it!  Your weapons and armor should enhance your already
deadly arcane skills, not try to give you an edge in a toe to toe, because
face it, if it comes to that, you're dead.  Let the melee work go to the
vulgar meatshields -- that's what they're for!
