Hi, I just installed EQ and cant seem to log in. When I check my
account I have a 1 month subscription.  When I try to log into the
game I get a error 1014 message but I cant find it in the knowledge
base.  I dont have a credit card and am planning on paying by buying
monthly time cards but cant seem to find anyplace to enter that
information either.  Was I lied to? Do I have to have a Credit Card to
use the account?
