Umm... those guardians didn't see through my invis... why would they see 
through yours?  I did a lap around close in to the tower, looking for the 
entrance, and they conned yellow indiff.  When invis dropped, scowls.  
Luckily, I was out of range then. :)

Anyway, I haven't had _anything_ in Iceclad see through invis.
