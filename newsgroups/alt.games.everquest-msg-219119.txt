It depends on how you define a 'better' healer. Druids are better at
healing someone NOW. Their (in)complete heals are more efficient and
heal for more than a shaman (3 and 5k for druid versus 2k for shaman).
Their high end direct heal also heals for more and is more efficient,
I think it's 1700/500mana for a druid and 1300/450 mana for a shaman. 

Shaman has the advantage if you don't need to heal as much over a
short period of time since druids have nothing that can touch the
efficiency of Quiessence.
