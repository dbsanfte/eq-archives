   Ok, I have to admit, I misspoke a bit on this.  If a wizard, druid,
or whatever gets agro, my idea of keeping them alive is to toss a HOT on
them.  If that doesn't work, and they keep getting agro, well, I know it
seems callous, but I figure they needed a timely lesson in agro
management.  I've not grouped with enchanters as often I'd like to
(everyone in the age.channel know how much I'd love to have a pet
enchanter follow me everywhere), but it does seem to me that when they
do get agro, they are pretty good at ditching it quickly.  Barring TPW,
I think I can say that I've never had an enchanter die in my group. 
But...  I still don't _like_ it when anyone in my group dies.

   I rarely cast Supheal, to be honest, or at least before Lenny
rerolled that was true.  I don't think that there is a bigger fan of HOT
than me.  And I know that Supheal is a crutch.  I hope that as I get
better at timing the Cheals, my use of it will go diminish to the
vanishing point.  Or, it would have if Lenny had stayed a warrior... I
don't know what the new dynamic is going to be with him as a SK.

   Robes usually do get the HOT with me, and generally I find that it
does keep them alive.  In fact, in most cases, it's overhealing, but at
a pretty cheap cost so I don't worry about it too much.  Maybe I've just
been lucky.  To be honest, I don't group with robes very often.  Usually
it's just Lenny and me.  But if you join us more, then I might have to
learn to adjust my healing.  Which is good.  I feel the more I learn,
the more effect I will be later when the chips are down.

   Yep.  And this is the main reason I want to be a cleric rather than
another priest class, even if another priest class might on paper seem
to be a better partner for Lenny.  I like healing, and I love being good
at it.

   I can see that happening.  I hope I'm a bit more flexible than that. 
But still, if the MT dies *3* times for the *same* reason, one might
think that even the most inflexible might see that perhaps their healing
strategies are in need of adjustment.

    At least you know about the issue.  I've grouped with robes who felt
that since they had a cleric in the group, they were invulnerable and
therefore could nuke their brains out.  And then their brains did get
splattered across the dungeon floor, they came to the obvious conclusion
that was the incompetent cleric's fault for letting them die.  I've only
been told I "suck" a couple of times, and usually by a wizard who's
mantra seemed to be "Nuke early and nuke hard!"  I have grouped with
excellent wizards as well too, who added to group without ending up
dead, so I feel that maybe it wasn't entirely my fault.
