By breaking the EULA.

The interesting aspect, legal theory about licenses aside, is probably that
of consequence. Breaking a law (and getting caught) gets you the punishment
prescribed in that law. Breaking a license (and getting caught) gets you the
punishment prescribed in that license.

 I believe the limit to which Sony can punish you for breaking their license
is to cancel the account and render the license null and void (thereby
making the client package you bought worth no more than the materials
purchased). They may choose not to. I think they would - it's good business
sense to enforce a license to discourage future transgression.

In a court of law, assuming it got that far, I don't think any judge would
go any further than allowing Sony to carry out their published license
punishment.
