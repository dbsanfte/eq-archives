Nah, I'm absolutely sure you still get mana from clarity while thirsty.  
I'm an enchanter and have gone without drink for very long periods of time 
with no problems.  My only doubt would be whether thirst totally 
eliminates base mana regen, or just decreases it.  Easily tested by 
complletely running yourself out of mana and seeing if you stay run out, 
though.
