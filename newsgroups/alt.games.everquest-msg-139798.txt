Daaamn..

This IS a worthy question...

I would have to say Seven Of Nine...  But her tits ARE augmented.
(She is Borg after all)

Now, as far as the sexiest scene????  T'Pol wins that hands down..
Remember the De-Con scene with Cmdr Tucker??  

WOOOWSA!!!  :^)  The first time my wife enjoyed Trek!!  :^)

The problem I have with T'Pol is her name is too close to T'Pau...   

Imagining T'Pau nekkid??  Brrrrrrrrrrrrr...
