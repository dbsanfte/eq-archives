My son just picked up a (used) copy of Everquest for PS2 at the
local GameCrazy store, along with a (new) 30 days pre-paid game
card.

When he enters the account key from the front of the manual,
he gets an "account consumed" message or something along
those lines, but the account key on the pre-paid game card
results in "invalid key" (tried with & without dashes).

Any ideas, or are we hosed?
