presumably the reason that they've increased their server farms and
hired more people is that there are more people playing the game.

but that also means there are more people *paying*.

so the only reasonable interpretation of the statement "their costs
have increased" has to be that it now costs them more *per server*
and/or *per employee*.

so yes, it would be interesting to see a cite explaining how their
per-server and per-employee costs have risen.
