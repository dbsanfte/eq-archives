A human paladin pal of mine and I (half-elf bard) were hunting gnolls
in Lake Rathetear.  Sometimes when they died, they said something about
"Prime Healer".  It really made us wonder if these were "good" gnolls.
Unfortunately, with the faction messages screwed up, there's no way to
tell what factions we really gained or lost. Anyone know?

FWIW: I checked my standing with clerics and paladins of Temple of Life
in Qeynos afterwards. I was indifferent there, but I have no idea what I
was before. So even if we did lose faction there, it probably wasn't too
much of a hit...
