It pretty much depends on you and your quest. The bard epic quest,
for instance, requires you that kill a bunch of dragons but it starts with

a simple relay race around Norrath. A first level bard with a high-level
SoW and a bit of luck could do it if he got a refresh on the SoW along
the way.

It really just depends on whether you're the kind of person who
has to have all of his strings tied up nicely all of the time or if
you're the type who can comfortably start something knowing that
you won't finish it until a year from now. If you're the former
then wait until you're of a level to complete the entire quest. Otherwise,

by all means get started as soon as you can reasonably accomplish
the goals of the quest.
