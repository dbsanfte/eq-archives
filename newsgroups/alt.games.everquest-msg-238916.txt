This far in the game I don't think anybody is under the assumption that 
any stats on any item are fixed and forever immutable... And anybody who 
has 20k to spend has certainly been around long enough to know that.

Precisely because those weapons are crafted, and so Sony cannot control 
the rate at which they enter the game.
