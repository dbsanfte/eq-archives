I had just hit lvl 30 in LOIO the other yesterday, went back to FV to sell
and hit the bank.  I always dump all my cash in the bank, never carrying
more than enough to buy food at most.  I was wandering around waiting for
the boat, hailing NPC's to see what they may/may not say.  I accidentally
attack one (HEE HAW, HEE HAW) and get myself killed.
I'm bound in FV, so I had to make a 10 second CR to my body to get my stuff
and collected 211pp off the corpse.  I was missing nothing in the bank and
am POSITIVE I had nothing on me.  I hadn't even had 211pp to deposit before
getting killed.
No-one in my guild had ever heard of this.
Anyone else ever heard of this, or just a bug?  Hell if I can make this
happen again, I might consider dying a little more often  :-)

Safe travels,
Sean...
