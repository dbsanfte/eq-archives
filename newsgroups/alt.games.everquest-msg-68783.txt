Nope, nor can you be transferred to it. You can't be transferred from
one type of server to another. For example, you could go from a
racewar server to another racewar server (paying the fee and being
naked unless it was verant's idea) but you can't go from sullen zek to
another team alignment server because their is none. Nor can you go
from the firiona vie roleplay server to another roleplay server
because there is none and the only kind of server they'd allow you to
xfer to would be another roleplay server which was also always anon
(and there is none and its what you don't like anyway)

Hmm.. an enchanter would always be anon anyway at 30 plus, ahaha.

Wow you know what this server sounds like now? The test server. People
play on the test server because it has a small closer knit society and
a lot more free resources, sounds like FV will be the same way.
