Didn't know about the crab traps; I'll have to swim down and look
for them (and mark them on my map).

As for fish, I'll add that I've used Sense Animals to train up my
Divination skill, and in other zones it sometimes targets fish in
nearby water, but in Abysmal Sea it always tells me there are no
animals nearby.  (Which is actually sort of handy if all you want
to do is practice the skill, especially if you're also training up
Fishing and don't want to get turned away from the edge of the dock!)
