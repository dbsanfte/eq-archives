          I went to bed early last night and as a result I'm up earlier than
normal. Tried to log in twice now and I get an error message after
submitting the username and password that says "Incorrect version number ,
run the patch ...." or something like that. I tried after the first message
rebooting, starting EQ an running the optional, kunark and velious patches
and I still get the same message. EQ's official Website says the servers are
all up. Anyone got any ideas? I've been playing since December and never saw
this message before.
