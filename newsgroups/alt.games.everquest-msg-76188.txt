"Real" healers are always nice :), but a skilled Paladin is the very 
best friend an enchanter could possibly have at most any level.  Unless 
the enchanter proves herself to be an idiot any Paladin worth a damn 
_will_ keep her alive.
This is because:
1) _nobody_ is better at keeping an Enchanter alive than a Paladin
2) bad pull + dead Enchanter is typicly followed by dead healer and I'm 
sure you can guess the rest
