Mistmoore on our server is very quiet...rarely more than a dozen people
there.   There's rarely any problem taking the whole lake area, as long as
that doesn't include the pass to the rest of the zone (IMO anyway).

You were right to dump him.  You should have, however, also said "hey wait,
we aren't handling loot that way" after the first time.  As soon as he gated
though, you were good to stick the "loser" stamp on his forehead.

Once ZONE is called, everyone should run like hell to the zone.  Just
because you're the person who does the invites doesn't make you the Group
Leader, and if there's no clear group leader there's nothing to worry about
when it comes time to save your butt after someone calls ZONE.  It's usually
the true tank's job (well, that'd be you in this case) to hang back as long
as possible WITHOUT DYING but - as your new friend said - you should have
called it earlier.
