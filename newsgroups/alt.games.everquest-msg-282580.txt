Is there anybody else in the world of EQ that thinks its perfectly
normal to try to level without grouping or getting power-leveled? I
have aTrolly Beastlord thats 12 and I get all kinds of people asking me
to group.  When I say "no thanks, I'm trying to solo my way up" they
usually are either rude about it or tell me I'm stupid to try it.
Now, I understand that EQ is awesome for grouping, and don't get me
wrong....I love grouping when I'm playing my main, BUT! Geez, when
someone wants too solo, just walk away!!  Thanks for letting me rant
and go on about that.  I have wanted to tell someone that for a
while!!!

Thanks!!
