I'm not sure, unless it was to make the look consistent with
that of the Barter Hall, since the two are connected.  (And on
that topic, I *know* PoK connects all over the place, but until
now it's always involved a portal statue.  Now you can go through
a door into the Barter Hall, and then through another door into
the Bazaar, at which point you're on Luclin.  Feels a bit odd.)

Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if they redid the Bazaar
because too many idiots never noticed (nor read about) the
Hide Traders button.  The new design does away with a lot of
the load passively, i.e. without requiring the player to know
anything.  (Insert standard gripe about dumbing down the game. :-)
