Er, no. Identity theft happens everywhere, but it happens a lot more 
where people don't have IDs. In fact, the biggest reason the UK 
government is considering introducing ID cards is because benefits fraud 
is *trivially easy* without them. I'm not saying that the cards make it 
impossible, but they certainly make it a lot harder, more so with more 
sophisticated forms of ID.

If you don't believe that identity theft is possible where there are no 
ID cards... Well, just ask the guy who posted his resume here. :)
