    No, a lot of the stuff from CoD is pretty good, especially the
priest-class stuff (belt, earring, ring, and chain leggings and the Atatl if
you're a SHM). The stuff I've seen listed as being from Torment are on a par
with the Bile-Soaked Shoes from CoD: some HPs/MANA, some resists, a low AC,
and nothing else.
