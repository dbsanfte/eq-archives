Yeah, the FV economy has always been peculiar because of this.  To 
compensate, there are also some low level items that go for higher than 
usual prices because you can't loot them from greenies due to the TLC. 
Not much higher, though, because its fairly easy to set up a "raid" in 
order to get around TLC if the prices get too high.

You can?  I know I've been away a long time, and probably wasn't all 
that interested in Augs even back when I was playing... but I thought 
the only way to get an Aug off something was to destroy it; leaving you 
with the item, but no aug.  Not so?  Something that changed, or has it 
always been that way and I just misunderstood?

Tribute is another one of those things I've stayed away from; I just 
don't like having to fuss with stuff all the time, I guess.  Anyway, if 
tribute is in the same cap, well I bet I soon won't care at all, because 
I have little doubt that I'll be at the 15 cap very soon, only need 4 
more points?  I bet I can get there with less than another 5K.
