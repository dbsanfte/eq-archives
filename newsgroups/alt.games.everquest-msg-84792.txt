It's up to the guild officers to keep to a minimum.  Exactly.  In my 
experience a well-run guild will keep it to a minimum.  If the guild 
doesn't, then it's not a guild I want to be part of.  If there was a 
handful of people causing the problems, they would need to be removed from 
the guild.  The guilds I have been in have removed troublemakers, and my 
current guild is very strict about /gu chat conduct.  
I am going to assume that you are familiar with the /ignore command.  It 
works on guildmates too.  If you have so many idiots in your guild that 
/ignore doesn't cut it, maybe you're in the wrong guild.  (Of course it 
could be that if you think everyone is an asshole, maybe you need to look 
closer at yourself.)

Where you said what?  That guildchat is full of gossip and blather?  The 
part that I cut and pasted from your previous post about how guildchat is 
full of gossip and blather?  Please, please, please clarify which 
statement you take offense too.  There are two sentences in my previous 
statement, one that uses a phrase I cut-n-pasted from you, and the other 
is a statement of why I expect that most people join a guild.  So you're 
either saying that my cut-n-paste is twisting your words, or that my 
assumption of why people join guilds is invalid.  I think the only one 
doing any twisting here is you Biz.

Nope, I'm not the one saying that I want to remain in a guild so full of 
gossip and blather that I have to turn /guildchat off.  When a guild 
doesn't meet my needs, I leave, and I would suggest than anyone else do 
the same.

I'm not the one making up the example.  I am taking your example and 
commenting on that.  If I have a problem, I deal with it.  I don't turn 
off /guildchat and sulk.  You make no mention of doing anything other than 
shutting off /guildchat.  You don't mention talking to anyone about it, or 
voicing your concerns to an officer, or anything else.

I've seen several comments you've made in which you mention communication, 
but based on your statements, you seem to believe that communication is a 
one-way street.  You've publically stated that you are not in a guild, and 
don't want to be in a guild, yet you claim to know about guild 
communication.  I'll give you a hint, even guilds with incredible 
out-of-band communication methods STILL rely on /guildchat for the 
majority of communication.  The guild I am currently in has a phone-tree, 
AIM, and a guild message board which probably has 50 messages a day, AND 
a publically available calendar.  We have around 60 active members, and 
having to send tells to all of those people is incredibly unweildy, 
especially if they're anon somewhere (in which case they don't appear on a 
/who all GUILD).  As a matter of fact, I probably spend 90% of my EQ time 
with guildmembers, and I do communicate in tells with them, but since 
we're raiding 4-6 nights a week, /guildchat is not an appropriate channel 
for general socializing much of the time.

Ohhhh, a strawman arguement, you're soooo leeet!  Nobody said anything 
about twinks, and since different guilds have different rules about 
twinks, we'll leave them out.   Of course maybe you want to know that 
there is a raid of The Hole happening, because you could really use that 
nice shoulder piece from there, but you wouldn't know, since you don't see 
the /guildchat.

Biz, I think you and I can at least agree that the world is full of 
idiots.  Everquest is the same.  I'm sure that you do your best to not 
associate with idiots in RL, and you probably still have a decent circle 
of friends (with the associated idiot SO/sibling/roommate/whatever who you 
ignore when they are around).  Why can't you do the same in EQ?  I'm 
really curious here.  There are guilds out there that treat all members as 
adults, and treat all members with respect (except for gnomes, gotta punt 
them), why can't you find one?  Is it that you don't look?

When I crawl into a bottle, I'm sure it will be obvious.  I am making a 
direct reference to your statement that 'the most successful guilds are 
<not> like this' and then assuming that you can make the mental leap to 
'most successful <foo> are NOT full of idiots'.  I'm sure you do your best 
to not associate with idiots in RL, yet it doesn't stop you from 
associating with people, even if some people are idiots.  I apologize for 
assuming that you had some intelligence.
OK, another example.  I remember something came up from one of your 
stalkers about having a CJ series Jeep.  Many Jeep owners, especially CJ 
owners, are rather fond of their vehicles and gather with others of 
similar interests to go 4-wheeling, talk tech, drink beer, whatever.  
Would you be involved in a Jeep club if they spent their whole time 
talking gossip and blather?  Most likely not.  Would you assume that all 
Jeep clubs are that way because one was?  Probably not.  Why is EQ so 
different?

Umm, I've left your previous paragraph in there.  When you can't give a 
single reason why you want to be in a guild without screaming that you're 
not going to be someone's nigger, I think that's pretty obvious that 
you're more concerned about what you're not going to do.

No, because you've never once indicated that you see anything positive 
about a guild, or that you would be expected to do anything other than be 
someone's nigger.  Statement's that you have made in this thread that lead 
me, and I think most reasonable people, to believe that you believe that 
the guild will take more from you than they could possibly give.  (Oh, 
btw, the everything/nothing is your wording, not mine, and I would 
sincerly appriciate it if you wouldn't attempt to twist my words, or if 
you must do so, at least cut and paste them out of context or something.)


  Once again, I'll
  point out that this kind of thing is up to the guild officers to keep
  to a minimum.

Ohhh, it's up to the officers, because I can't be bothered to do anything 
to help.  

  Like I said, the
  keyword here is "communication," however, it's been my experience in
  this game that communication isn't as high in the list of priorities  
  for many players as non-stop diarrhea of the mouth.

I don't want to associate with people with diarrhea of the mouth

  ("Oh, we all need a ride to xxxxx, but there's no room for you, the
  group is full... but you have to drop what you're doing and take us
  there. And later on tonight we need you to PL a couple people who have
  never done shit for you that you've never heard of. You can pick us up
  at ten." I've seen too many friends put up with this kind of bullshit,
  thank you.)

Bitching about what they expect from you, not a single thing about what 
you'll give, other than ports, which you won't give, because you don't 
want to be anyone's nigger.

  I'm not. But it's been my experience with friends that this is the
  behavior that most guilds exhibit, particularly large guilds.

You've never experienced it, but you've heard about it.  Ohhh, that's 
useful.  Now you're hearing from several people who are IN largish guilds 
that this isn't the case, but we must be full of shit.  

  It's going just fine at level 58, thank you, and I haven't had
  to put up with a million demands from people I don't know demanding
  taxi service from Misty to WC.

Again, mentioning what you're NOT going to do.  Of course since even you 
admit that sucessful guilds aren't going to require this, why do you keep 
repeating it?

  The day the guild leader buys my game and pays for my
  gametime, he can tell me when and where to be.

I think this is the real winner here.  You spend all this time bitching 
about what you're not going to do, and then you say you're only going to 
show up for your guild if they pay for your game and access?  You are a 
pip Biz, I'll give you that.

Name exactly what you said you would contribute.  I haven't seen a single 
thing.  Based on your posts in this thread, you won't contribute ports, 
you won't contribute time, you won't contribute jack shit.

Let me re-phrase my answer.  You get exactly the same reaction if you're 
not on the minimum hours a week as if you're not on /guildchat the minimum 
hours per week.  You will get a chance to discuss it with an officer, and 
you may be removed from the guild.  We have strict limites to how many of 
each class are allowed in, and we're not going to waste a slot on someone 
who isn't there.  (Yes, we allow for inactive members, and have about a 
dozen at any time.  Military deployment is the biggest reason.)

No, I go to the websites, and check out the requirements.  Name a 
sucessful high-end guild on any server, and I'll bet they have playtime 
requirement.  I'm sure that Hughes and Ben Wilson and 
others in top-end guilds will back me on this one.

Excuse me, I did answer it.  Or is:

  If you're not on the <foo> hours per week, you'll be
  /guildremoved.)  So, if you're not in /guildchat, it's the same as not
  being on according to you, so you should be /guildremoved.

not clear enough.  There is no difference between not being on and being 
on and not in /guildchat.  If you're not meeting the requirements, you'll 
have to discuss it with an officer, and may end up being dropped.

Well, you are right.  Arguing with you is rather difficult, but I still 
hold out hope that I can penetrate that shroud of ignorance.  Hope springs 
eternal.
