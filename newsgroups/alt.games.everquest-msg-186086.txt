True enough.  I had originally taken the chanter to Befallen some weeks ago
on a Saturday night, expecting to find a group easily enough. What I found
instead was an empty zone.  Grabbing a pick-up group in thoses zones seems
to have become somewhat problematic ... hence your point.

So a couple of RL buddies of mine made the SK and the Cleric respectively,
levelled each appropriately for their class (the three of us can't really
abide the whole practice of PLing, so we do it the old fashioned way ...
easy enough to do these days), and Friday we headed over to WC.
