I can only speak from Beta experience, which probably isnt fair,
but...

I wasnt impressed either. I couldnt believe that a fantasy RP game
DIDNT have dungeons. And much like my reaction when they announced SWG
was going gold when they did, I couldnt believe it. The amount of bugs
and lack of content was pretty huge when they said "WERE READY!!".

No dungeons? What the heck? Imagine an EQ world filled with Overtheres
and Dreadlands and nothing else. Yikes. *yawns* But maybe thats just
me.

Content. It all seems to be about content. Seems that the new
offerings are very weak in this regard (SWG being one of the worst).
Its almost unfair to compare to a game (EQ) that has almost 5 years to
build that content. When you run out of things to do, things to
achieve, you get bored. Plain and simple.
