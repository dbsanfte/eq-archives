Reports I have seen have said its not that bad.
The mitigation is down but the avoidance is up.
The overall effect is a wash except on high end
monks tanking high end mobs which they should
not be doing since they are not tanks anyway.

The 2 monk reports I have seen from actual monks
on the test server said that they can still solo the same
mobs they did before. They get hit for more but get
hit less often.
