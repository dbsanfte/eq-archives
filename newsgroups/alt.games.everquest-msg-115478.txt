You still have yet to give a reason why they are not "in the character
of the race" that's not an asanine assumption that Halflings and
Tolkein's Hobbits are the same thing.

Like I said, that's no different than saying that the male Teir'dal
should be weaker than the females because TD and Drow are the same
thing.

In short, it's bullshit. "Based on" != "same thing".
