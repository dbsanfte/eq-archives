I thought I was over this problem but since the 11/19 patch it's a problem again. Usually 
several times a day it hits me again now.
 
 For no apparent reason that I can discern, after sometimes being online for hours without 
a problem at all, all of a sudden my connection bar goes red and chunky (many spaces in the 
bar, not solid) and I'm on my way to LDville again. If I hit "H" and hail, the connection 
bar immediately goes green and solid for perhaps 30 seconds or so and then resumes the 
chunky and red behavior. Hailing again makes it go green. Saying anything seems to have 
the same effect. 
 
 While I play EQ I can look at the lights on my network hub here which connects my two 
computers to the cable modem. Usual activity for these lights while I am playing EQ, other 
than zoning is a lazy, consistent blink... blink... blink... as I assume normal packets 
are being passed back and forth to the server. When I zone it goes solid for roughly 15 - 20 
seconds as the zone info is downloaded and goes back to the normal, slow blinking. This 
is normal, no problem behavior.
 
 When I get this going-LD-red-bar-clearable-by-hailing problem the light for this connection 
is solid and furious as if I am zoning or am downloading a very large file at very high 
speed over cable. When I do the Hail! thing, the light stops for a second blinks normally 
a few times, my connection bar goes green and solid and then the hub light goes back to 
being pretty much solid and furiously blinking and my connection bar goes red again. I can 
do this over and over. If I zone, normal zoning activity seems to happen and when I enter 
the new zone the blinking is normal for a short period of time but after 30 seconds or so, 
it resumes the red-connection-bar-chunky-imminent-LD behavior again that I can temporarily 
clear by hailing.
 
 This can happen in any zone. PoP zones, Luclin, Velious, Old World, it doesn't matter. When 
it happens it happens everywhere. And there seems to be no rhyme or reason when it will
happen. 
Sometimes it happens immediately upon logging in, sometimes after I have been online and 
playing with no apparent problems for hours it will suddenly start happening. This solid hub 
light never happens outside of playing EQ other than when I am intentionally downloading a 
file. Never. Not with any other online game I play. This problem seems completely isolated 
to EQ only.
 
 Sometimes camping, shutting down windows completely and turning off the computer for a
period 
of time and relogging will fix it. Sometimes not. Today, I logged on and started puttering 
around in PoK. The bar started going red. Hailing cleared it but the red bar came back.
Gated 
to GFay, same thing going on. I then camped, shut down windows and shut off computer for
roughly 
5 minutes before rebooting and re-logging on. Upon entering my password, I appeared where I 
camped completely bypassing the server selection and character selection screens. The LD 
problem seemed to be gone, I was online for over an hour after that with no apparent
problems.
 
 So ok. Why, after camping normally, shutting down windows, rebooting and re-logging back
into 
EQ do I somehow bypass the server and char select screens after entering my password? Was I 
still connected to Sony's server despite being offline as well as shut down? Why is my modem 
and hub light lighting up solid occasionally when I play EQ as if I am receiving massive
amounts 
of data? This would explain why normal EQ packets are not being received correctly and I
cannot 
play EQ normally without going LD.
 
 During these times when this problem occurs I have tried pinging as well as doing a series 
of traceroutes to the server I play on (mithanielmarr.everquest.com or 
199.108.3.80 and eqworld-32.989studios.com). Nothing seems amiss with these connections
other 
than a slightly higher than normal ping than I like at a few places (150 ms - 200 ms)
everything 
seems fine.
 
 I sure would like to know what causes this. It sure seems to me that at some point, for
some 
reason, the server I am connected to suddenly decides to send me massive amounts of data as 
if I am zoning which seems to interfere with the normal packets I need to send and receive
to 
play EQ and have a nice, solid, green connection bar and not go LD. I want to know why this 
happens and I am sure a few others would too. As I remember there were quite a few posts
posts 
on the Sony Tech Forum
(http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?
action=topics&forum=Technical+Help&number=3) describing problems much like this.
 
 I have a sneaking suspicion that this is an artifact of the new code that encrypts packets
to defeat programs such as ShowEQ. Perhaps the encrypted packets never quite get decrypted
making EQ resend packets over and over. Damned if I know but it never used to happen to me
prior to PoP.
