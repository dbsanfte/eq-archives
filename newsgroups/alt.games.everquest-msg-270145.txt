I keep thinking that there must be some benefit to having all this
money. I just reached level 16 in tradeskill and started making maple
boxes which are netting me about 80 sp a night. But there's nothing to
spend the money on. To me NQ would be the worst place to live just
because there's no Mariner's bell and takes too long to get into and
out of. How could there be such a deep flaw in designing this game?
