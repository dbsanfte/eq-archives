Aoebe is a cleric, level 22.  She bought, begged, and actually got the
Undead Froglok Tounge, the tiny RH eye, and begged a beak
and bought a pelt for the Fine Antique Ring quest.  She bought
the three jewels for the veil, but the hope diamond is nowhere to be seen.

She might get some higher level buddies to hunt that down.

She has the mana conservation I and Healing I focust items, but was
disappointed after paying 800pp for a some kind of boot that only
procs at level 45,  it didn't mention that on the screen when it was
looked at...oh well.

Funds are low, now, so back to Exp'in, and making kiolas and padding.
The market for Padding on Luclin has dropped some, some folks
are selling the padding at 15-19....I try and get to them before
they sell out, and usually only buy inthe 15-18pp range for resale.

I like PC, but I never have been able to make it to B2.  Got killed there
twice on the way....I sit, hang out at B1, toss an ungrouped heal if someone
is dying (10% or less), buff the folks that seem to need AC, and usually
only have to wait about 10-15 minutes before an invite happens.
I find that get's me in group faster than ranting, or begging....

Aoebe, 22 Cleric on Luclin, most nights that the babies don't keep me busy.
