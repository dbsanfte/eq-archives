    Our guild necromancers solo the ancient shriekers in The Deep by rotting
them. Level 53 to 55, don't summon. To get in you invis most of the way, run
like hell once something sees through, and Harmshield off the cliff. Camp
out at the bottom to clear aggro (stuff can't chase you down and tends to
forget about you, but better safe than sorry), then climb up the far side
and you're on the ledge a short ways from where they live. They pull singly
and are non-KOS.

    And if you know any guilds that want to kill Lord Seru, they might be
interested in buying one of the drops off those mushrooms.

    James
