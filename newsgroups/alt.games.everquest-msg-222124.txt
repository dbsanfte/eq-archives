Not really relevant in anything except a raid situation.

While the enchanter may be telling the tank which mobs to attack next,
everyone should still be assisting the tank.  The enchanter will be
switching targets frequently, meaning a late assist (common for casters that
do not attack immediately or constantly) could end up breaking mez.  Or
worse, DoT'ing a mob that is not the current target.

In the low 50's especially, paladins make great pullers.   They can pacify
on thier own, and are generally the main tank.   Whenever possible you want
the main tank pulling, as there is a bonus to hate for being the first
person to get on the aggro list.

Bards also make incredible pullers, combining lull with crowd control.

Rogues have sneak, which is very useful for pulling.   It can result in less
adds if mobs are facing in the correct direction.   It also compliments a FD
puller almost flawlessly.
