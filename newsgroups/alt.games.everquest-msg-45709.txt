Hehe, i know. Luckily i have guildies and friends that know that i need the 2
forages, so get a lot from them.
But generally Morning Dew is easy to get, lots of newbies have some, and people who
dont know what its for usually keep it in bank, since it stackable, so you can
usually find a lot from people.
Oak Bark are bad. Foraging is the normal way to do it, every time i do something
where i DONT have to play EQ (making dinner, watching TV, reading and so on), i just
log my druid on and sit in Kith and forage.

WAIT untill you have 158 skill. Wu might be a big pain in the ass to make, its
limited how much fun you can get in Heart Spider Cave in Guk. I usually got guildie
warriors down there to PL them. Its safe from 12, and can get to level 19. It take
the same time to PL and to get silk yourself, so why not do it.
But materials for Wu armor are SOOOO much easier to get, so be sure to get to 158
before doing cultural, stock up in Oak Bark and mithril bonings until you get there
(oh, and get your smithing higher, you need it. Bonings are trivial at over 100
skill, and the FierDal sewing kit are 157 i think).

I charge 400pp for a pair of boots. When i first started i took 1K for them, sold 4
in a few days, but i prefer to sell a lot for less price, so i dont run around with
10 boots all the time. 400pp seems to be a good price on Veeshan.
GEBs are 5K right now, and personally i have never seen any of the other wis boots
for sale, gues that if anyone actually get one they can use, or know someone who can.
So the only other competition are GEBs, and at their price the middle level people
will not be able to afford them.
I dont like varying my prices depending on failure rate, so 400pp is the set price.
If im lucky i make the boots in 1 combine, and make over 300pp profit. If im unlucky
(like last night, 10 combines, 1 boot) i loose money on the sale, but it will get in
again later on.

Oh, and you cant farm greenies in Warsilik for oak bark, its foraged there too *S*.
