Well, what he wants you to do is to kill paladins and such *associated*
with the two temples. The ones you should be looking for are Grennet
Stormhands (who hangs out in the newbie zone by the secret catacombs
entrance), Brother Estle in West Karana, and some fast-running paladin who
runs around in West Karana by Brother Estle.

You might want to wait a level or 2 before tackling them. Paladins with
their pesky "lay on hands" ability can be very tricky to take out.
