Killing spree?  On anything but 65/Hard adventures, trash mobs don't
go on killing sprees.  Hell, I can handle a prolonged beating from
1 of those with ease, and mages are the most delicate of any classes.

You want to minimize ping-pong - have that enchanter your so worried
about stand next to the warrior.  THat way the mob doesn't move.

Also, we don't rez casters during LDoN adventures - they bind outside,
run back and loot (except 1 item) and keep going.
