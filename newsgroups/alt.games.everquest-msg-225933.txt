I haven't done one with an under-50 character, but a friend who has says the
ones his 40's druid does are a breeze compared to the ones he does with his
Paladin (56).  My normal weekday group (levels 57-62) did a dungeon last
night.  It was a slaughter of 60 mobs, it went about as smoothly as I would
think possible and we were still winding down on the clock when we got the
last kill - probably 10 minutes left.  The best I've done are collection
missions where we finished with around 30 minutes left.  When I read about
people breezing through dungeons in 40 minutes, I'm always wondering if they
are doing it post-50 and, if so, WHAT ARE THEIR TECHNIQUES?
