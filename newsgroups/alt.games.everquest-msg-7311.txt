These are the sorts of opposing views that made selling the GBS so
hard.  Someone would offer 1kpp for it and I'd think "You're crazy!"
Then someone else would try to trade some 2kpp robe for it, someone
else I was talking to said they'd buy it for 5kpp if they had the
money, etc.  Whenever I'd tell someone "I'm looking for at least 10kpp
for it" they'd either ignore me completely or tell me I was nuts.
After a while it looked like selling it for plat only would be
difficult, so I finally broke down and traded.  (I made a mistake in
my earlier post, it wasn't a plat veil I traded for, it was a velium
ruby veil).  So after the trade and switching around my equipment, I
added 20 wis and 8 str, which isn't bad at all IMO.
