Not necessarily. It could well be (in fact, I tend to favour the idea) 
that Lamarck was right after all, and acquired traits are in fact 
inheritable. This would be evolution without natural selection (which is 
overrated as a mechanism, anyway, as pure chance is more important than 
fitness when it comes to reproductive success).

/shrug. Evolution with ID instead of natural selection would be just 
artificial selection, like breeding Dexter cattle for their horribly 
short legs. Still, you can't really supplant natural selection with ID, 
because it's not a self-contained theory... You would need yet another 
theory to explain the designer, and the designer's designer, and so on.
