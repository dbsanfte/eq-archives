Not really, the 10 Commandments are OT.  Alot of the laws that accompanied
that time may also have been for temporal reasons more than spiritual.  Most
of the foods, like pork, would not have been good for a people wandering the
desert.

Uncertainty.  Many are unwilling to risk going against the Bible, and are
willing to accept some restrictions, in order to ensure they're in line
where it counts.  In other words, many don't know which bits are kept, and
which are obsolete, so they keep them all.
