<snip>

** Alternate Advancement **

# Mana Burn will only land any given target only once every minute.  If a
cast of Mana Burn is unable to land, the timer will not be used.
# Spell Casting Mastery once again works in the same manner that it did
before the previous patch

<snip>

## Encounters ##

Due to the number of Luclin encounters requiring original Rods of
Transvergence to be defeated by a reasonably sized force, a number of those
encounters have been be re-tuned to shorten their duration.

** Miscellaneous **

# Fixed an issue that was causing zones to crash in some circumstances
# Fixed an issue that was causing merchants to behave erratically while
handling certain quantities of items
