See my explanation/history above on my reply to GaryBelson.

Thank you for your time, I think I may have done the reinstallation of the
drivers wrong, seems like a couple of different ways to do, getting Direct X
in teh right sequence, gettign rid of old drivers, ghosts--I have spent
hours getting rid of 3dfx files, dlls and reg entries and 1) it makes no
effect on staying on EQ, and 2) I keep finding more.
