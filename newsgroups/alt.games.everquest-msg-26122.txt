Yes and no.  It was created to give people more places to explore
and hunt, not to "test new loot rules".  But as long as it was
being added, the developers decided to try out some new loot
rules and see how well they worked.

And yes the Warrens had the modified loot rules from day one.

But what I believe he was trying to say was not:

  "The loot rules stopped the farmers who had been farming
   the Warrens"

...which is how you apparently read it, instead he was saying:

  "The loot rules stopped the arrival of farmers who otherwise
  would have been all over the place, getting in the way of
  the lowbies who the zone was actually designed to serve."
