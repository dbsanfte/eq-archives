I am lv 20 paladin and haven't been keen to explore the thundering steppes
solo, and stormhold just kills me fast. Do the shards spawn there? I have
looked everywhere else and those types are consistently missing from my
collections. People are charging around 3-7 gp each for them and there's no
point in paying that much when the finished item sells for around that
price!
