I'm having a hard time following you, Dan.  AA generally no exciting... and
you are putting 90% into it?

I put 100% into AA to get Run one, and now I'm at zero.  I imagine I'll
slide that up to 10% or so when I hit 56, but without a specific AA goal,
I don't see the point of stopping a far more useful advance... every
time I level I get new spells, more mana, faster mana regen, more HP,
fewer mob resists... heck, this has -got- to be better than one more point
in some AA I don't care about.

Run one, I care about... always been a firm believer in being able to outrun
mobs, whether it meant grouping with SOWers, buying SOW potions, or
getting TBoots/JBoots... now here's one that works without begging, buying,
or clicking, even on my naked dead body...and better still, it works -indoors-
