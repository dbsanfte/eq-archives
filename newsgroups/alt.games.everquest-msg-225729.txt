I think what's worse is when people start demanding buffs while you're
fighting mobs.  We had one guy that spammed the screen everytime he
asked for buffs.  Everyone wanted to beat his ass.   I think a lot of
players like that have been spoiled and some don't think they can
survive the fight without a particular buff missing.   

No, you're not old...you're just unspoiled.  There are too many
pampered people in EQ.
