All good points, but stun to hold it, root to park it and wrath to
kill the damn thing.  If I'm doing that combo, I'm figuring I'll kill
it.

Good for pick up groups that are a little ragged.  

Otherwise I stick to the stuns.  Still have to play with Atone, but as
mentioned before, rarely do I get and keep aggro.  I'm sure that'll
change as I level up  (?).

Note:  I normally do NOT do pickup groups...  ;-)
