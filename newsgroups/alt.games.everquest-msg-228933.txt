Primary healer and slower is the one I find myself doing more and more.  
Opens up a spot for more DPS.  I prefer doing this with a Paladin as the 
MA/backup healer, and rezzer (has not been needed yet), and then, depending 
on where I am, 4 DPS types, or 3 DPS and one CC.  In these groups, I have 
zero time for doing ghetto CC myself, I spend all my time slowing, healing, 
and canning back mana.
