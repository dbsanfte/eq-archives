}>Kabbalah, as used in some occult groups, is effectively a form of 
}>numerology. 
}You seem to be conflating gematria with Kabbalah.
}There are a few different facets of the system.
}Contrast gematria with notariqon, as one example.

Yeah, I was on the way home when it occurred to me that that whole 
paragraph coulda been summed up as 'some are only into Kaballah for the 
Gematria'. :)

}>Bah.  I suspect Charles Leland's "Aradia: Gospel of the Witches" prbably 
}>doesn't mention him though.  Similarly with Margaret Murray's "The Witch 
}>Cult in Western Europe" or "The God of the Witches".
}No, I shouldn't think they do. 
}They don't mention Wicca either.

Well, bother, then why does this site list them as being important in the 
history and development of Wicca? :)

}>}Are there any serious claims that Gardner had
}>}nothing to do with Wicca?
}>Never said he had nothing to do with Wicca, just that he isn't  
}>universally revered as an authority.
}His reverence amongst other Wiccans is immaterial.
}I'm saying he is probably the most important
}single person in the development of Wicca.
}Other Wiccans may like or dislike him, but his
}contribution cannot be ignored.

Never underestimate people's ability to ignore things. :)

}>Well, some don't seem to think those writings line up with their je ne 
}>sais quoi very well. 
}Who are these people?

Well, they claim to be Wiccans.  I certainly wouldn't feel it was my place 
to tell them they aren't.  Be a bit like telling Eastern Orthodox 
Christans they aren't really Christian.

}>}Who would you say has been 'necessary' to Wicca?
}>I wouldn't say.  I'd go ask a Wiccan.  And as Lokari wisely observed, 
}>three Wiccans would probably give me three widely different answers. :) 
}Three Wiccans may well give you three different
}answers on the history of Wicca, but only one
}could be correct.

Err... you mean only one would agree with you? :)

}>Actually, this page here puts it pretty well:
}>----- http://www.religioustolerance.org/witchcra.htm
}>You'll note that one view mentions Gardner, and the other, strangely, does 
}>not...
}Did you click on the links contained in the
}passage you cited?

I see by my browser history that I clicked on two outta three. :) These 
pages load so slowly though.  I skipped the neo-pagans.

}If you had, you would have read this;
}"There is general agreement that Wicca first
}became a mass movement in recent times in England
}during the 1950's with the publishing of books by
}Gerald Gardner. It has expanded at a furious rate
}in North America and Europe." 

And strangely enough, if you look right above where you quoted that from, 
you find [brackets mine]:

---- 
Other individuals discount this [in reference to Gardner's] belief system 
and maintain that there was no continuous Wiccan presence from Celtic 
times to the 20th century. They maintain that present-day Wicca was 
created by merging a few ancient Celtic beliefs, deity structure, and 
seasonal days of celebration with modern material from ceremonial magick, 
the Masonic Order, etc.
           
Still others trace Wicca back to a little known faith group in 
New England in the early 20th century.
---- http://www.religioustolerance.org/wic_hist.htm

Now, you could argue that just because they disagree with Gardner's belief 
system, they still must accept that he created their (dffering) belief 
system as well... But that 'little known faith group' might be hard to get 
around, what with Gardner writing in 1950ish and all. 

}This is a matter of history. If you can find
}anyone who can document a different history, I'll
}be glad to listen.

I'm too lazy for that, you'll have to settle for evidence of the existence 
of people who feel they can so document. :)

}>}Some questions for you and any Wiccans interested in the truth of the 
}>}matter;
}>Ooooh, there's an absolute, incontrovertible truth? :)
}Was kind of pompous, wasn't it?

Not really.  But it left me an opening to be a smartass. :)

}>}What is the origin and symbolism of the pentagram?
}>http://dylangwalchmai.tripod.com/symbolism/pentagram.htm
}>http://www.thornr.demon.co.uk/kchrist/pent.html
}>http://yew.lweb.net/pent.htm
}In these essays, they all refer to the connection
}(indirectly), between the Tetragrammaton and the
}pentagram. If you have any further interest, you
}might like to check out the (in)famous Eliphas
}Levi representation.

Oooh, time for a round of "Where's Yahweh?", the game that's fun for all 
the family!  I think I see him standing behind the bleachers, there, next 
to the skinny greek mathematician.

}>}Who is Robert Cochrane 

<possibly excessive snippage>

}So.... it does have some significance to some
}Wiccans, at least?

Never argued that.  Unquestionably.

}Or would you conclude from the above, that it has 
}"no significance whatsoever"?

Nor that.  I'm just saying that not -all- will know, care, or consider it 
relevant.  It may have no significance whatsoever to them, in fact.  If I 
-did- say it had "no significance whatsoever", and that quote isn't as 
badly out of context as I suspect it is, I clearly overstated the case.

}>}A matter of degree perhaps, but you couldn't say
}>}that the 23rd Psalm has "no significance
}>}whatsoever" to Christianity, could you?
}>Not at all, nor would I say that YHVH has -no- significance whatsoever to 
}>Wicca.  But I don't think it's absolutey required reading.
}No, nor do I.

So... we agree?  Is that allowed? :)
