I am about ready to come back to EQ after a several months absence.  I
am also considering to ditch my L65 98AA Paladin and start something
new, SK perhaps or Bard, not sure yet, don't have the time for heavy
raiding which is about all my pally is good for anymore (can only do
so much SU in LDoN before I am bored senseless).  Anyway, is there a
decent server population list?

I'd like to start on a server that hasn't fallen to the "let's all
rush to PoTime really quick" urge, if there is such a thing.

Based on a couple of weeks of irregular ping logs I would prefer one
of the following servers: Fennin Ro, Eci, Solusek Ro, Innoruuk,
Druzzil Ro, Luclin, Terris Thule, Drinal, Tholuxe Paells, Xev, Ayonae
Ro, Vazaelle, and Zebuxoruk.
I would also like to stay away from old servers, they are for the most
part too crowded, but I was unable to find an overview when which
server went online.  If anyone knows those stats I'd appreciate a
reply/link.

Thanks in advance!
