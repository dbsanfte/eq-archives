I haven't been playing my cleric in POP much recently, and today
noticed a distinct change.

I was in a POV group, LC.  For an hour, I didn't get hit once.
OOoh , superior cleric has really honed his aggro avoidance, I
thought.  Then I started a BP heal after a mob died, looked away
to say something to the wife, and looked back to find the MA had
ignored my admonition to stay put for 30 seconds, ran off, and
returned with the next mob.  She'd arrow pulled and ran straight
back, my Cheal landed while she was still running in, as I
watched, reaching for the DA hotkey... mob didn't so much as
glance my direction.

Boggled, I started healing more aggressively.  Getting in close
to the mob to heal.  Chealing two people in a row with no pause
in between.  Fast heals, HOTs, CHeals, nothing I did got me hit
at all  (well other than standing next to a mob when the chanter
decided root was a good form of crowd control)

After a couple hours I did finally manage to get heal aggro.
Monk pulled, I healed while he was running in with two Supernal
Remedies in a row.  Mob peeled off, hit me about four times, and
the monk peeled it back off me, still didn't have to DA.

The mobs did have aggro issues, they'd go for the chanter, the
shaman, the druid (for tash, slow, and the occaisional really
early snare, or big nuke) but not in any of those cases did the
victim report having just cast a heal.

In any zone in EQ a month ago these tactics would have gotten my
head slapped around a few times.  In POP up until recently, these
tactics would have been a certain death sentance, heal aggro was
insanely high and only the most careful management would allow
long runs of not getting my head staved in.   This is what
finally convinced me to buy a horse (not that I'm not very happy
with it, as it turns out) and DvArbitration... ways of minimizing
the massive cleric aggro problems in POP zones.

Of course the real test is in raid level POP mobs, where casual
aggro management techniques suitable for exp groups dont'
apply... so I'm eager to hear reports from that kind of action as
well as others' impressions of current 'regular' healing aggro.
