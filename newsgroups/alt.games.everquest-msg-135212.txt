The last time I made a skinning knife (been a while) one of the
required pieces (hilt mold?) was no longer available on any vendor
in Freeport, I had to go to Faydwer to make it.  As I recall there
was a thread on the EQTraders smithing forum lamenting this particular
annoyance (result of a patch that mostly made trade skills lots less
hassle, many ingredients were added to cities that had lacked them).

I suggest checking EQTraders for the locations of vendors selling the
ingredients you need.
