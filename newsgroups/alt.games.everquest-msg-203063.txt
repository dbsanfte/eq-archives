DO you actualy read your own posts?

"So having KEI in the game saves you time..." is you responce to "This makes
it harder for non-KEI'd players to find groups".

What was being said was that what should take a compleat group was being
done by a smaller group that didn't want any more members because they where
being gready with the XP.  These same groups are going to find now that they
don't know how to effectively play there characters and have to fight light
blues to learn mana and agro managment.  That tidy litle group of 3 with KEI
and AEGO that could run through multiple red mobs without going oom ar now
going to find that they can barely handle a simple blue before someone is
oom(probable the geto healer that decided to nuke)  KIE mad the lower levels
so trivial that noone ever learned there classes.  No we will see who knows
what can and cant be done.

Nice try, but it really doesn't make any sense. ( God I love quoting you.
Crash youshould try I bet this get's the type of responce you where looking
for.)
