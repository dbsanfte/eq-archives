In all liklihood you'd have to wait for verant to have another movelog
to the euro server (fairly possible I'd guess since people say its not
that populated) in order to transfer your character with all its junk.
That is their policy, if they initiate it you keep your stuff but if
you want to go you go naked and I guess it now costs you money also.
