Actually, you have three questions about faction.  :-)

Yes, different kills *can* give different amounts of faction change.
However, *most* kills give a single point of faction change.  So
do most quests.

The major exceptions to the "one point per kill" rule seem to be
the "named" mobs, especially guards and such.  Killing them
will often give roughly 100 points of faction decrease (but only
one point of faction increase to opposing factions).

The "special case" exceptions are in Velious, where the three-way
faction triad (giants/dwarves/dragons) give more decrease per kill
than increase, but not a hugely different amount (unless you're
killing some of the special "named" uber-mobs like the Dain, etc.)

And certain mobs give far larger decreases -- killing Sir Lucan
(the head of the Freeport Militia, a required part of the Paladin
Soulfire quest) gives roughly a 1000 point decrease (!) for
*each* of his forms (live and undead, and you have to kill
both for the quest).

 --- to -751    ...scowls at you, ready to attack
-750 to -501    ...glares at you threateningly
-500 to -101    ...glowers at you dubiously
-100 to -1      ...looks your way apprehensively
0 to 99         ...regards you indifferently
100 to 499      ...judges you amiably
500 to 749      ...kindly considers you
750 to xxx      ...looks upon you warmly
xxx to +++      ...regards you an ally

"Ally" was added just a few months ago, I'm sorry I don't have
the exact breakpoint between that and "warmly".

And you're right, there's no way to tell where exactly you
are in a given "band".


>3.  Are particular factions more or less resistant to change?

No, unless the game provides you fewer ways (or only hard
ways) to raise/lower it.  Other than that, there's no
faction group that is "set in stone", nor any that
have wider ranges of "dubious", for example.

Also, some people believe that certain things in the
game can make you "irretrievably KoS", but there's no
evidence to support that claim.  Even huge faction hits
can be repaired if you perform enough faction-raising
actions.

The closest thing that exists is factions where being
KoS blocks you from any of the known faction-raising
quests (since you need to be able to interact with
a quest NPC who is on that faction himself), which
seems to be the case for some of the factions damaged
by hunting in the Plane of Growth.

But there's no such thing as a faction for which it
is futile to keep doing faction-raising quests (not
counting the trivial case where you're already maxed
with that faction and get the "could not possibly
get any better" message).
