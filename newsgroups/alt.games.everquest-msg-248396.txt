I think if WoW gets good reviews, while EQ2 is getting panned for bugs 
and content issues people will jump to WoW shortly after its release.

Bob made a comment regarding SWG elsewhere... essentially to the effect 
that: "Its Star Wars. Period." And he's right. SWG couldn't fail to get 
a good segment of the market. They could shovel you Star Wars Pong while 
they retune the whole game...and people would stay subscribed...

I disagree.

If he was fully immersed in EQ and game X comes out and gets 4000 bad 
reviews there is no way he's going to pull out of EQ and give it a try. 
a) he's content where he is. b) game X reportedly sucks.

4000 good reviews... that kind of positive buzz will penetrate even to 
someone reasonably content with EQ. It won't suck everyone out, but it 
will get the attention of sizable number of people; enough to try to try 
it out at least.

Agreed ... to a point. The window of opportunity is minimally a 2-4 
months... but if the first one out of the gate bungles it badly enough 
it could extend further...much further...

Hmmm the *vast majority* of EQs player base was not endgame in 6 months 
from release. In some of the other games yes, but that was because they 
were easier to level in more than anything else...and in some games 6 
months is enough to *beat* the endgame... and start casting about for 
the next thing to do...

Get paid? I'd settle for abolition of the idea that I should be bowing 
and scraping for the priviledge of helping them test their systems. Comp 
me the game or a few months subscription and I'd call it even... but 
selling beta slots (LoE), and the general attitude that its me that 
needs them has to go...

I disagree. MS's dominance is primarily momentum. MS has almost always 
been buggier (except maybe circa 2000 when OS9 and Windows 2000 were 
dominant... but even then we had Windows ME... to ... bear with.)

Apple has been first to market with the majority of key innovations, and 
for the most part they have been less buggy. Microsoft came later, but 
came cheaper... a least for the box... long term TCO analysis is much 
more interesting.

Anyway, Fast forward 10-20 years ... and its all momentum today. The era 
of OS X vs Windows XP is coloured more by history than the relative 
merits of the two products or when they arrived on the market.
