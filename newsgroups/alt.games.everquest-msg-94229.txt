There's a spell, that frees up space in your valuable inventoryspace,
can be cast at all times, even if you went to kedge or the gray and
forgot to buy the components and doesn't require you to run around
again for the components, can be cast if you died etc and you argue
why people would like to have it? You just like argueing, don't you?
:)

PS: SH has batwings .. for instance on the shaman spell vendor
