Quite the contrary, you can easily START these without the money,
just recognize that to get the really nice parts you are going to have
to sink that money and time in eventually

One and two just take drops from killing giants.  Three takes the
irritating to get griffin egg drops (as well as several much easier
to get drops) and cooking skill.  But you can easily and very
cheaply get cooking skill up to a point where making the souffle
is trivial by buying a couple backpacks worth of bat wings and
of fish, and spending an hour or two cooking Fish Rolls, which
are actually a nice food to have.

In addition to the third shawl, this part yeilds a nice range slot
item that may last you a long time... my admittedly lazy cleric
didn't replace his until 60th level.

I'd say the "must do" quest for druids, though, is the POTC
quest, which yeilds a very useful 59th level spell, but which
also yeilds two different extremely nice earrings for a druid.
While you aren't likely to be able to complete this quest at
your level (unless you have major funding from a rich uncle or
something) it will eventually be a lot cheaper if you have some
trade skills worked up, reducing the number of parts you
have to buy.  Doing the Shawls quests also require lots of
trade skills, which means you get double the "bang" for your
time and money sunk into the skills.
