For the druid:

If you have them on separate accounts/boxes, having a 45+ cleric with
donal's vambraces is a good way to PL your druid.  Have druid put up
both DS lines on self and go into battle whacking away.  The cleric
just chain clicks the valor proc for infinite hp.

Katta Isle is great for getting up to 25-ish with this technique, as
you will have many adds (increasing DS efficiency) and a great exp
bonus.  Plus, your druid can charm the cougars and lions in there to
further increase efficiency.

Upper guk (ghoulbane camp) is great to get up to 33 from 25.  I did 26
to 30 in 6 hours playtime with this.  It's quite a thrill to have 4 to
6 froggies beating on your druid and come out alive.  Unfortunately,
the camp starts to get green at 33 and you'll have to find someplace
else to get you up to the next circle of spells at 34.

Gearwise, it helps to have a really good weapon, and to train your
points in the weapon skill initially.  When it gets to the end of the
fight, the mob will go into run mode and the DS won't do much good
unless you are diligent with root.  Alternatively, if you've been
keeping up on casting skills, you can just nuke away.

(Standard disclaimer here about having to spend many hours chain
casting lower level spells from all 5 spell lines to keep up casting
skills, but not a problem if druid is on a second box while you play
your main)


For the wizard:

Kinda hard to PL this class.  But here's a fun way to do it, as long
as you have lots of cash available.  Head to the bazaar and purchase
some sow potions.  Then start auctioning for KEI.  Always auction with
the price you want to pay upfront, you will get much better response. 
Although tempting, please don't send personal tells unsolicited, I
would like to keep my KEI sources as happy (and available) as possible
=)  If no one responds in the bazaar, try the nexus.

Once you get your dose of KEI, head out to your favorite kiting
grounds and start chain pulling!  I found it much more fun to have a
partner you know pretty well do this with you, to keep things
interesting.  A druid partner provides you with a great arsenal of
utility spells (especially for the pre-29 wiz), but most other kiting
classes will do just fine when KEI'd.

I don't believe you need incredible gear to do this.  Who needs a
large mana pool when you have 14 mana per tick regen for 2.5 hours?



Now, as to the "should you PL" question, I think a lot of people PL
these two classes in particular, with no harm done.  It's great to
have a porting class on a second account for your main.  And, of
course, these chars are (hopefully) not used in normal
grouping/raiding situations.
