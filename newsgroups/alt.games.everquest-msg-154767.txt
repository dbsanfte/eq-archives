I agree, and this has always been a problem for warriors, it the "we don't
scale" problem.  One warrior, great.  Two warriors, good, you have a backup
plan.  Three warriors... gee, couldn't find anyone else?  Practically any class
better than a third warrior.

My thought was, with the new CHeal, any high HP warrior would do fine (ones over
8500, anyway, your baby warriors wouldn't apply) but working it thru, I found
that that wasn't going to be the case after all.  Higher HP = better warrior,
even when over the CHeal limit.
