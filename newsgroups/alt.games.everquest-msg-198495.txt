The guy is an idiot.  That said, I think the whole TRAIN TO ZONE shout at
that level of zone is not needed.  On lower-level zones it is needed so the
newbies know what is coming.  But for the higher levels it is a known fact
that trains can and will be pulled to zone lines.  If you park your group
near a zone line then you must be willing to accept the trash that may be
pulled to you.
