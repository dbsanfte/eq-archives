Pointless to continue to try and get a resource that is, moderately soon as
far as history goes, going to run out.  By all accounts oil will run out
between 2025 and 2050.  By some accounts I've read, by 2005 it will cost
more to retrieve one barrel of oil, than the energy the barrel of oil itself
will contain.  Why fuck with the wildlife if we don't need to be?
Continuing to open new drilling areas keeps us addicted to the need for oil
when what we should be doing is using resources to fund better and renewable
energy sources such as wind and sun techonology.
