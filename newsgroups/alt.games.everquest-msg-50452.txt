If you raid kael at all it doesn't matter. My whole guild is plus cov
but we also kill the dragon stuff in north TOV and kill stuff in
skyshrine sometimes and get down to warmly then raid kael again. Once
allied I killed stuff in skyshrine with friends quite a lot and stayed
allied, they are small hits. The outdoor dragons like woushi are very
small hits also, the North TOV wurms or wyverns and such are bigger
hits to Cov. I've heard original brood hits bring you all the way down
but we are not likely able to kill them anyway.. or yelinek. I'd wait
until I had all my TOV skyshrine quest stuff to kill yelinek and even
then I bet kael raids and doing vindi/statue/tormax gets you to allied
again fast.

So if you can raid kael or even get in some small kael pick up groups,
then kill some stuff in skyshrine when your faction is high.
