I had an idea for like an "assassin bow hit".  See, to me, Rangers really,
Really, REALLY need to have their niche empowered.  Their niche?  Their bow
IMO.  They are supposed to be the best at it by design.  In practice, it
needs to be better.  (Again, IMO).

Give Rangers the ability to hit a mob from across the entire zone, with 50%
chance of instant death I say.  Make 'em be able to do it once per
30mins/halfday/day/whatever but let them be A SNIPER!

Ok flame.
