I doubt it....  They probably would have blown themselves up - much
like that guy twirling that rock sling around over his head in attempt
to launch that rock in a rock throwing festival. Dude fucked *that*
up, and when we tried to release it, the dam thing wond itself up around
his arm/head or some shit, and POW  he beaned himself in the head with
his own rock and knocked himself off his feet! God that was funny !!
Besides, they'd have to first be sart enough to get a nuke, but over
and above that, they'd have to be smart enough to *know* what one is.
And honestly, I really don't think they do.  Remember, they are still
into the rocks, and still tring to master that whole rock sling thing.

Lights-out for that dude beaning himself in the head with his own rock!
