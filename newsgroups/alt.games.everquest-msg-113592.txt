You know, I checked out the threads on the (real) 8th shawl last night
and briefly lost my will to live :)
(Making a high elf grandmaster smith is going to be much less tempting
when I have to damn near grandmaster my wood elf anyway. Thank
goodness I am at 110 already...)

((Oh, and you do not want to know how much velium I've sold to
vendors. And to top it off, I've just started exping somewhere *other*
than Velk's after getting most of 5 levels there, and was kinda glad
to not have to go there all that much anymore :)  ))
