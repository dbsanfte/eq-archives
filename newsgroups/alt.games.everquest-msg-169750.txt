Chardok Royals is a tricky raid.  We've done King raids...I think 4 times, 3
semi-successfully and one we just gave up after 2 wipes.  We've never had a
COH mage to help.  (CRAP!  My 48 mage is non-KOS to Chardok and I just
acquired a 50 non-KOS rogue & thought "oh cool, now my mage can get DECENT
xp" but...he's only 7 levels from COH and a non-KOS COHer is too freaking
valuable :( ).

Once you get into the King room it's an easy camp (ok not cakewalk...SOME
people have to stay near the computer) and respawn is 1:45 hours.

Just keep trying...my guild had zero epic clerics before Rage change...we
now have 7.
