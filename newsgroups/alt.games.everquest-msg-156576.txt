The skeletons qualify as "warrior class" as opposed to a rogue mob,
necro mob, mage mob, clerical mob, etc.   Recently warriors got a new
ability called Shield.  This allows them to absorb a part of the damage
for their groupmates for a period of time, acting as a living shield. 
In keeping with SOE's ongoing "Up With Mobs" campaign, the warrior class
mobs were given the same ability. They are tanking for each other now,
just like we do.
