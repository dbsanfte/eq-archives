Exactly, there is a risk of death, therefore it is till dangerous. The mob
might get lucky and resist your spells or a large number of his buddies
might show up and you'll be unable to handle all of them with mana remaining
and spells currently memmed. What is "total death" and how is it different
from death?

Chanters  and druids are always posting here about how unpredictable the
duration of charm is, especially for the druids. That guard in't going to
suddenly turn on you before he has finished with the mob you brought him.

There won't ever be someone coming by relying on that sarnak to help him out
because of the train scorching his fanny. I don't arrange fights between
mobs but I certainly do kill off the winner whenever I come across this
situation.

No, but it was being an obnoxious asshole (and for the record, I never use
that word, it's the only one I know that is strong enough to describe you).
There is nothing worse than someone who kills guards for loot. There are
newbies relying on these guards for help.

The wandering guards do come in handy when you're too far from the gate to
town. At the very least the lower level wandering guard will keep the mob
busy and allow you to increase the gap.

The cleric is given the proper tools to level: he has the best healing
spells and armor/hp buffs in the game. This ensures that he is always in
demand for a group. And if the group knows what it's doing and the MT holds
constant agro then the cleric doesn't even have to worry about joining
groups that are fighting mobs that a wizard or necro of like level couldn't
help with. There is no need to exploit the guards and take them from those
that really need theml.
