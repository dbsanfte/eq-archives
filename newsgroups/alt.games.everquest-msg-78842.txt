Slight correction:  They could up until about a week ago,
at which point Verant removed one of the key NPCs and replaced
him with a non-working "!" version (Verant's age-old way
of blocking a certain NPC from spawning as usual).

So if anyone is planning on running out and doing the Ghoulbane
quest real fast before the next patch, it ain't gonna work.
After the patch, presumably, the quest NPC will be returned,
but only Paladins will be able to do anything useful with the
result (ok, and SK's too, since they need a Ghoulbane for one of
their own quests).

But up until the quest was put on hold, many non-Paladins
were running around completing the quest in order to try to
sell the results to Paladins.  The auction price of a
Ghoulbane had been dropping rapidly from its pre-quest
price of 2k+.  Tonight, however, I saw a (non-Paladin)
guy in N.FP frantically trying to sell off his Ghoulbane 
before it became completely worthless to him (i.e., the
moment it goes No Drop, it's just wasted space in his
bank account and he might as well destroy it).
