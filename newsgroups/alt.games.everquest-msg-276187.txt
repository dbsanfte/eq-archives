I think that I read in the patch notes that the 75% damage has been
reduced to 25% (but I wasn't paying too much attention so I could be
wrong).

Yeah, I think that you are right.  I must have half-read something or
other that led me to believe that there was experience loss.

That is really good isn't it.

I still like EQ1 and EQ2 as well.  I'm not sure if EQ2 or WoW will win
with me in the long run but a major factor is going to be that my
machine runs WoW much much better than it runs EQ2.  I have to run EQ2
on the second worst graphics quality setting and I even have to turn
the quality down in a lot of places when I am in a group.

It seems that you like Hunters.  :-)
