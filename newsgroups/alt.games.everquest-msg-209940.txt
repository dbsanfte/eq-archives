i made this comment in passing, but i've been thinking about it for my last
few hours of playtime:

why does archery dps stink for me ?

27 ranger, maxed archery skill ( + hawkeye, gives +10 archery skill) ,
roughly 190 dex, using 30/38 bow and 1 damage arrows

i usually play with 52% haste (combined spell + item)

most  hits are for 30-40 damage, crits are 60ish, crap hits are in the
teens, and i generally land 50-70% of my attacks, depending on con of mob

my dps blows.....

were i using standard toe to toe melee, just like a monk, rogue, or warrior,
i'd have a certain amount of dps, and those other classes, with the same
gear, would have roughly the same dps

however, archery....the thing rangers should be best at...is also around the
same damage as other melee -AND- that damage is  PITIFUL

what gives? is the archery skill something that is supposed to be a generic
"toy" skill until 51? and after that, it isn't a good full-time means of dps
until the ranger reaches archery mastery (or while using /disc trueshot)??

i don't mean to just 'troll' the archery skill or whatever, but a 10k sword
hits like a 10k sword, yet my 10k bow hits like garbage, and they both make
me look stupid when i say "you tank, i'll plunk it with arrows" because i'm
not doing any real damage at all (i stopped saying that)

so, is it a damage cap thing (break 30 and i wont complain anymore?)?  is it
a haste thing? is the bow bad? or, sadly, is it a level thing?

it seems that archery doesn't get "turned on" until 51, unless the
progression to more damage is only starting now...

i'm disappointed

sorry,

~chrismonster~
