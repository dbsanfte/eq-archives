I'm excessively out of the loop at the moment, but since this sort of
thing was my bread and butter when I played, I'd like to tentatively
suggest Solusek C as a place to try out.  Always felt like we were doing a
proper dungeon crawl with that place, rarely found it occupied, and the
loot varied from nice to pretty awesome (for the time anyhow...no idea
anymore what's good and what's ho-hum).

And you can't beat Howling Stones for excitement and adventure.
