I don't think I can take all the credit for that, do you?

Well, you know what they say happens when you mention the Devil.

Every few months I get the urge to load up Everquest again, and when I do, I
have a look in here to see whats going on.

The game still seems attractive, but I just don't think I have the time to
accomplish what I'd like to do.

I always kept newsgroup politics out of the faq, and confined my flamewars
to other threads.

I will certainly be reading this new faq, especially if there is a section
on LDON.
