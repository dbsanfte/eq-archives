I was playing in Qeynos last night with my Cleric lvl7 and when it turned
night there was nothing to hunt so crossed the boarder to QH.
I stayed close to the edge just in case  the Skelies hit hard there at
night, (this was my first time there at night since the update).  I am doing
quite well, most things are Blue or White.  Since I am a Froglok with a
Lightstone, I see quite well at night and I am watching a group of three
running flat-out to the boarder with one big and two little Skellies on
there tail.  They are red when conned and the big one was red in color.  The
first of the 3 hunters made it accross the boarder when all of a sudden the
big Skelie breaks from the group and BAM he has traveled a huge distance and
hits me one time.  Like I said I was next to the boarder and was able to get
accross but only 4 left on my life scale.  I was just watching, quite a
distance from anything.  When they come out at night, they be mean.
