    Yes there's another post where I confirm that I meant "shaman" thre
instead of iksar.

    I have a log of a 57 shammy's pet breaking 30DPS with regular monotony
in PoN. Parser is yaulp, 10 fights chosen at random had the pet breaking
30DPS most of the time. Peak DPS was 34.

    The 58SK pet (44 necro pet I believe) hangs around the 20DPS mark,
depending on positioning and what you're fighting, so I think shammies
should feel a bit ripped off if their 55 pet doesn't hit 30.

Cheers,
James
