Coming soon to a HP/Compaq Presario near you.
In an effort to cut costs Carly Fiorina of HP-Invent(which has swallowed Compaq
and is trying to digest without Tums) has invented a way to save money on
technical support costs to her company.

In approximately 90 days (by December-January) all Compaq US and Canada
technical support centers for consumer Compaq desktop, notebook, printer and
other products (maybe affects some HP products as well) will be closed.

Technicians at these facilities were getting as high as 18.00 19.00 dollars per
hour for their work, just too high for HP/Compaq to service their customers.

2.00-3.00 buck per hour Indians will handle technical support. The quality
varies. They will commonly tell a customer to reinstall the printer drivers for
a paper jam error. The quality of English spoken varies as well. If the caller
has a working knowledge of Hindu to facilitate communication with many of the
Indian agents encountered, it would be very helpful to both parties.

Indians are a lovely people and their accents are so sexy to some, no doubt a
contributing factor for HP-Invent to choose them over existing technical
support facilities. 

If anyone in this news group owns/wants to own a Compaq Presario (some Evo 
products) and can penetrate thick, Hindu accents by individuals who appear to
be studying English, you should do just fine with them.

Indians already now are beginning to take these calls and there is a 60 to 80%
chance that one will be contacted should one call with a technical support
question on a Compaq Presario or Evo notebook.

Compaq Consumer technical support can be reached at 1800-652-6672 option 1 if
you wish to "contact a 'Compaq part of the new HP' Indian now" to try before
you buy your Presario game computer.

Sales people who speak pristine American English are standing by to sell. Call
1 800 888 0220 to get your Compaq part of the new HP Presario computer nowâ€¦.

Best Regards
