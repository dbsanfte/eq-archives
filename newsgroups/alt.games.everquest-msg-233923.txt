Unless you are on a PVP server, no. You would not be able to root him,
and 90% sure Cancel magic wouldnt work either (I believe at one time
maybe it would have).

Be careful tho at getting revenge on someone. Even tho this punk
deserved it, taking an aggressive action towards someone (not on a pvp
server) can get you into trouble with GMs (if they ever show up that
is). If someone trains you, and you retaliate by training him back in
view of a GM - you will be the one who gets nailed. Also if you cuss
back at him, he can report you and you'll be the one who gets in
trouble. Sucks, I know. The only real thing you can do is explain to
him his shortcomings (in an adult fashion) and watch and let him die,
and refuse him any pleasentries in the future. So in summary, you did
the right thing. You could also warn the zone about this guy and help
spread the bad word on this punk.
