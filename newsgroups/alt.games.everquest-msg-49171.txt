    Go visit Fires of Heaven's web board. They hate it.

    It's better than EQ? Cool! How many quests, mob models, different
armour/object graphics, and cities does it have? How many things are there
to discover? Oh, now you want to compare DAoC to EQ when IT came out? Well,
here's news for you - compare DAoC to today's EQ, because that's the one you
buy in the store.

    As opposed to the joke that is PvE in DAoC. Guess which I prefer. 8/

>trade skills are a joke

    Trade skills in DAoC are broken. There's no reason to NOT do them, and
in fact if you want the best gear you HAVE to do them. EQ has a community of
tradeskillers - I doubt DAoC will ever have that, since everything is so
cookie-cutter simple. And because trade skills produce the best items in
game, PvE is completely pointless - you do it to level, and get cash for
tradeskills.

    I also have questions about whether the "enforced pause" when making
something will prove to be more downtime than if someone with proper pack
arrangement in EQ did a similar item, but having not tried the DAoC
tradeskill system personally I can't tell.

>most quests are nothing more than NPC guided hack-n-slash,
>fuck-it-didn't-drop, wait, hack-n-slash some more.

    As opposed to what few quests being in game being delivery quests, or
even better, a-dozen-of-us-killed-it-so-it-had-a-dozen-heads quests.

    My predictions for DAoC:

(1) They will deal with anyone messing with their vision of how things
should go even more harshly than EQ. This is the game that bans folks who
are dewds in public channels on their RP servers, remember, with Tweety as a
rep.
(2) When the "exploits" are found in DAoC, the nerfs will come as fast and
as furious as in any previous MMOG.
(3) If one realm owns the others in PvP badly enough, expect more nerfs a
plenty. Players will complain, and will be soundly rebuffed by a company
that sounds like it doesn't care.

    In short: Mythic will be just like everyone else, no matter how many
times you say "but they REALLY care".
