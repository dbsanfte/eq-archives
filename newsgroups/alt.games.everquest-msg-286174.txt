For the past 4 and a half months I've been on the road, only able to 
connect to the net via WiFi at fast food places and the like.

I managed to log onto EQ a few times, but didn't really do much, just 
greeted old friends mostly...

Last night, back at home, I finally logged in with a good connection and 
some time to enjoy it.

After another round of the "whats up" chorus, one of my old buddies got 
a group together for me, and we went off to do a couple flags.

We're on the Combine server (which apparantly combined with Sleeper 
while I was away), so we only have up to OOW open at the moment, and 
when I left, we were only up to GOD.  But the guild I'm in is dedicated 
to going thru the content in order, so although GOD was available, in 
fact as a guild we were only up to Luclin, and hadn't done any POP 
flagging at all as a matter of principle.

Guild is now in POP, doing elementals working on getting into Time.

So, we decided first thing first, go do a POJ trial.

5 man group, my 65 SK, plus a rogue, paladin, druid, and cleric, all in 
the upper 60s.

Since I was still trying to get used to the interface, and playing 
again, the paladin was MA.

The trial was a total cakewalk; paladin sat down in the middle of the 
room for each wave, we used assist and killed her targets in order.

When Vulak popped, the cleric and paladin were down to 50% mana, but 
still the only death was my pet.

A little running around, and I had that flag under my belt and a free AA 
in the bargain.

I remember back when POP was released, and my guild back then trying to 
do trials with an average group level of 57, going thru trial of 
execution over 100 times before finally beating it, and then going thru 
another 50 times or so to flag guildmates.  Edge of the seat stuff, 
barely doable if everyone was really on their game AND we got lucky with 
the pops.

Really funny to have it be such a cakewalk we could do it with no CC, 
and one of the party (me, struggling to relearn EQ on the fly) spending 
half the trial hitting wrong mobs or using a relatively ineffective 
spell list and the wrong weapon.

Afterwards, we went over to WW and the druid pulled in the burning 
efreeti, so I could get the heart and use it to get the alternate flag 
for Sol Ro tower.  Apparantly this has been neglected by a significant 
part of the guild, to such an extent that they've had problems getting 
the unflagged in via the 85% rule.  Since thats on the schedule tonight, 
I'll look cool for having the flag instead of being part of the problem.

Not too long afterwards, I logged out, hopefully I'll have time to play 
a bit more this afternoon before the raid tonight... but its good to 
have blood on my hands again!

Berg, 65 SK, Combine
