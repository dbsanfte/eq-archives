However, we can probably assume that if they are going to make traps and
locks important in LDoN dungeons, the dungeons for lower level people will
have traps and locks that can be handled with lower level skill.

Bards are still probably useless in this area, but not because of their low,
but rather because they don't get some of these skills until late.  What
Sony should probably do is lower the levels at which Bards get these skills.
At high levels, Rogues will still be needed if you have a lock or trap do
deal with, but it would allow Bards to serve in, say, the 20-40 range.
