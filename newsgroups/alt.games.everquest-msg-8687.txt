 I think the main problem with Kael is that it's stuck right in the
middle of your travel route. If you don't have a port available you have
to run through it. This adds points to their favor for those who can't
invis themselves. Skyshrine is similar but if you know the way you can
probably train your way to the fountain room and get out in time.

 In my opinion Skyshrine and Kael should have been off to the side like
Thurgadin so you didn't have to travel through unfriendly territory to
get to the next zone. But I didn't design SoV so there you go...
