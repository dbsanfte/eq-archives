Actually, I'd expect that a majority of them do exactly that.  Many
young programmers think of game programming (especially popular games)
as as a very cool thing to do.  Not too long ago (? a year or two ?)
some college or university in Washington state decided to offer a
degree in game programming (forget what they called it) with an
enrollment cap, they were swamped with applicants within days.  I'd
bet that, while "mature" talent _might_ be at a premium, the sheer
number of interested youngsters allows them to put together a fairly
strong team at a steep discount over "standard" salary costs.
