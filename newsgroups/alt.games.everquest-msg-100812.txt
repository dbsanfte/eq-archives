Here's a quote from Alan VanCouvering (verant spokesman) to show that
you can't necessarily believe everything that's been told to you about
Norrath.

"It's important to understand that lore is written by folks with a
viewpoint. The Dark Elves don't view history the same way that the
High Elves do. Until recently very few Norrathians believed that wild
tale that Ogres accepted as truth, that one about them once being like
gods in the far distant past. In fact, I can think of a few
interesting tid-bits of information that Norrathians take for granted
as true that are not as true as they thinkï¿½"
