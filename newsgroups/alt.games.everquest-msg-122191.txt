You've found my favorite bard song (well i have a few, but it's really high
up there).  Anyhow, speaking of this song...if you have velious, then I
suggestion in a level or two you head to the ry'gorr fort in Eastern Wastes.
It's usually pretty crowded but if you find it not camped then head into the
main gate and take a sharp left.  The walls are section by pillars and the
very first section is a great place to pull too.  Hit something with snare
or fufils or whatever and run and put your back against that wall...then
start screaming (make sure your brass skill is caught up).  When the mob
takes flight it will run into the wall and keep running into the wall and
you can whack it to your hearts content, just sing fear fear fear...I know
there is another place like this in FV, but i didn't learn about it till it
did me no good, the rygorr's are great exp and pretty good loot, plus they
are spaced out so well that usually you can pull just one or two with no
problem...Bring along a warrior, ranger, monk, or rogue for some serious
melee damage and watch the orcs fall swiftly.
