No the fall won't.... but the room full of nasties WILL kill a 40. Hmm 
happened just last night as I recall. Said druid being my fiance and 
having never been there didn't know about the well. (I was working on 
LP). She didn't have gate memmed. It was ugly. :( On the other hand I'd 
like to thank the cleric and warrior from Knights of Valor (Floug and 
Magada). Nice people.
