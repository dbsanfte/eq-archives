I did see a high level mage pound the soulbinder in EFP, the guy was
50+ and had his earth pet with him, think he was there for like 15
minutes at least, even think that i did see that the soulbinder hit
xxx for 123dmg :) the spulbinder had lost 1/8th of his health at the
time and did not seem to lose anymore :)
