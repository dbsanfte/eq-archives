Being Agnostic does not mean that you are not sure that God exists
necessarily.  It all depends on which definition of Agnostic you are using.
You can be quite certain that God exists, and yet, at the same time, believe
that it is impossible to prove the existence of God.  You can also be quite
certain that God does not exist, and still believe that it is impossible to
prove.  The inability to prove the existence or lack thereof is one
definition of Agnosticism.  The other definition is what you are using.
Both are accepted definitions, although, from my experience, the one that is
currently more common is that an Agnostic does not know whether God exists
or not.
