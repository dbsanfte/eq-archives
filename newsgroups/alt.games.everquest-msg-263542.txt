Windows does support more ram.  For EQ, particularly if you are running 
two instances, I'd highly recommend 1GB.  With that new system, I would 
definitely look at upgrading that video card.  I went with the 9800 pro 
myself because it seemed to be about the best bang for the buck.  I am 
thrilled with it, compared to both the 4200 I had, and the piece of crap 
5200 I had.

For reference, my system specs are

ASUS A7N8X-E
Athlon XP 3200+ 400MHz FSB
1GB Dual Channel DDR400
80GB 7200RPM HD
