When you drift to another topic i.e. a druids role in a group and correct
someone who gave the right answer to the question asked. Better place for it
would have been in direct response to the original poster vs. following up
another post. The way you did it, it makes a correct response to the
question look like it is subject to debate.

I think you should be caned for doing it. Oh, wait a second. I am drifting
this to Singapore/Thailand thread.

That would be wrong wouldn't it?
