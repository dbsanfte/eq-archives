Well, if you copy eqclient.ini before you make any changes and it looks bad
it shouldn't be a big deal to just restore the original.

I made the recommendations on my VD3 card and the picture quality was bad so
I turned MIP on.  BAD idea...couldn't figure out how to fix it so I deleted
my eqclient.ini and that "fixed" it.  At least I could get into the game. :p

I understand the GeForce2MX 400s (64MB) are going for around $55 right
now...sounds like it's time to make a long overdue upgrade.
