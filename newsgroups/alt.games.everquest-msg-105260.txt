Nonsense.

If you're calculating DPS for a melee do you only include the
time they're actually dealing damage?   Or do you include the
time they're waiting for their weapon(s) to recycle?

DPS is meant to indicate sustained damage.  For melee, that
includes weapon recycle times.  For casters that includes
mana recycle times.
