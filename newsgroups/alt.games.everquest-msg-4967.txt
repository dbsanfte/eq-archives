Because it's traditional, if one wishes to have any credibility,
to make sure that one acts credibly and not hypocritically.

Oh, this is too easy...

So, you won't "attack unless attacked", eh?  Then perhaps you could
explain why, despite the fact that I had never before attacked you,
mentioned you by name, or even replied to any of your posts, you
called me a "fucking liar"?  Is that not an unprovoked attack, child?

Be careful how you respond, there's a bear trap hidden in that question...

I invite you to look up "projection" in any good psychological text.

We're not taking the game seriously.  What we are taking seriously
is people barging in here purposely disrupting the place, acting
like major asses, in order to gratify their own personality disorders.

That's cause for concern and irritation no matter how trivial may be
the subject which is being interrupted by the braying of jackasses.

In fact, it might even be more understandable if the subject under
discussion were a serious, emotion-provoking one.  But for trolls
to come in here and display their outbursts in a newsgroup
normally dedicated to a fun, lighthearted subject, you just have
to wonder what in the hell is wrong with them.
