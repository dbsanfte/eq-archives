I would guess the lag is not monitor related. I run EQ just fine on a 
UXGA laptop (1600x1200) at a lower resolution in game and I don't notice 
any difference in image quality. That is with most of the Luclin models 
turned on.

RAM being 512MB minimum and having one of the top-notch graphics 
controllers onboard makes all the difference in the world. Mine has the 
GeForce2 Go with 32MB memory.

All this said, I do get somewhat more lag on my laptop than I do my PC. 
It's nothing too bad though. In fact I'd wager it runs EQ as good as if 
not better than the *average* PC.
