Uh... well, yeah.  I thought it was generally known I don't have any
chars in their 40s yet.  But then, most of the above are level 1 focus
effects and are useless over level 20.  The thing is, I've noticed a
huge price difference between level 1 and anything over, *and* I found
it much easier to find focus effects with otherwise useful stats.
Dunno if I'm just behind the times list-wise, but it seems like a
fairly thin field in II and up if you don't want to use a slot *just*
for the focus effect.
