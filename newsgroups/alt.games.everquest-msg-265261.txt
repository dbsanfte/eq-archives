Yeah, I had that happen when I installed the character creation toolkit 
also.  Not the first time here, either.  CoH did that to me too.  Was hiding 
the firewall blocking popup behind the game window and I couldn't figure out 
what was going on.

That said, you can't reserve your name as you mentioned in your original 
post.  You can save the character with any name you want, but come game 
launch you will need to submit the name to the names server at that time. 
It doesn't reach the SOE names server until you try to port that saved 
character into the game at launch.
