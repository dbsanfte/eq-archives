I have to agree with you there, unless you are on a PvP server you aren't
affecting anyone's game.
The only argument against this would be if a inexperienced player obtained a
55+ (or even 50+) character and then was foolish enough to attend raids with
it, this would possibly effect other players. The fungi tunic in question
would not do that and I am certain you don't go any raids with the Chimp, I
refuse to even group with my 2 "additions" unless the group is all friends
who are fully aware that I am playing more than one account and so am not
firing on all cylinders.

I don't agree with the sale of virtual property for real money in games, not
because of the EULA as I break that every time I log on my Druid and
Enchanter, regardless whether I would willing return the accounts to the
original owners if they wished to return to EQ, both who I know in real
life, or that no money changed hands for these. I am against it because it
is such practices that made farming in EQ an occupation (ruining the game
for many) and spawned the likes of Dark Snow.
