I'm wondering what a real life area has to do with an EQ guild, I
can't see how you'd really combine the two in such a way that you
wanted them to be in the same city. Perhaps the poster was ignorant of
how wide time zones are and that if he meant that he could of just
said "people in the US Central time zone", or Eastern or someting ( I
don't know which one memphis is in really but of course he should)
