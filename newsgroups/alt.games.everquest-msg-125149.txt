True, they may quit eventually. Or they'll band together, form
uberguilds and gleefully use 'sploits while telling each other how
badass they are.

Honestly, I'd rather do my part in getting them banned if they're
going to insist on knowingly and willfully violating a rule which is
important for the spirit of gameplay. They can cheat all they want in
a single-player game. But when you add in other players, cheating
becomes a problem.

Problem is, I have to look at the graffitti on the wall every day. The
property manager has to pay to have it cleaned off eventually. Guess
who's rent is going towards paying for that instead of improvements to
the pool?
