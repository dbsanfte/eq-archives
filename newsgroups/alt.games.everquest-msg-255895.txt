Not a lot of open raids run at 3am. Just because people who don't belong 
to guilds can get flagged at 8pm easily enough doesn't do the off-peak 
players any good at all. In fact, in many of the cases the mobs aren't 
even available to be raided that late if by some miracle enough people 
formed up; peak time raids open and closed took them out and they have a 
lengthy respawn time (not all raids of course, but several of them).
