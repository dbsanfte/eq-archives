I'm half-elf ranger based around Qeynos and have just reached level 9 :).
Just a couple of questions which will point me in the right direction.

I am really short on cash - what's a quick way of raising some serious dosh
quickly? I've tried the willowisp thing but always get slaughtered - I think
they're still out of my league!

I am getting bored around Qeynos and want to get some serious fights going
(but not to difficult) - any suggestions for some good hunting at my level?

What's the point of building alchohol tolerance (its about 280 in the
realworld!)?

I need some decent weapons - what's the best way cash or quest?

Thx
