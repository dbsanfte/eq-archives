Last night, I was in CB helping people out.  I did a /ooc camp check to see
where people were, and immediately got a few rather rude /tells back stating
that there was a wedding going on, shut up (only not so nicely).  I was
unaware of this, as I keep the shout channel turned off.  One of the party
even started jumping all over a guildie of mine and tried to duel her (he
was in his twenties, she was 8...ooh, big man, he ran off when I tried to
duel him...welcome to /ignore....).

I can understand people wanting to have an uninterrupted wedding, but come
on...Isn't it a little ridiculous to hold a wedding in one of the busiest
low level dungeons, then expect everyone to shut up and sit still until you
are done?

ok, /rant OFF
