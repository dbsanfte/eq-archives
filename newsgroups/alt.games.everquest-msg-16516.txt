Every now and then EQ is obligated to shut down their servers without notice
so that its subscribers may sample " real life ". Many of thier members have
no concept of this but denying freedom to humans is illegal so they have to
turn their addictive drug off every once in a while allowing its users to be
free for short periods of time.

Dont worry though, as soon as the "survurs" are switched on again the users
will return to their lobotomised state in front of thier PC's and will no
longer be a hazard to society.

If you see a user, approach it with caution ( it may be in shock and bite).
If you can safely interact with the user congratulate it on its new found
freedom. Try to help it through its withdrawl symptoms.

Thank you
