Not a bit upset Jazz.  In fact, now I am curious too.   What is aggro in EQ
short for anyway?

aggravate?     as in 'to aggravate" the Mob
aggrieve?       as in "to aggrieve"   the Mob
aggressive?   as in "to make the Mob aggressive"

How do we end up with aggro from these anyway? sigh...so confusing
