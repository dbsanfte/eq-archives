Same thing different line...
You insist yours is the only and right way and anyone not doing so results
the in "punitive action" of being ignored.
Childish & selfish!
What if posting was to be only in HTML?
What if posting was only if you used your in game name?
What if a larger market of Orientals join?

Same thing. You views are yours, not the "right & only".

All to often over the past few years I see more and more of these claims of
how "it's to be this way".
