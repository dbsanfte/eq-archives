*applause*

I've seen countless "uber guilds" on my server crash and burn
precisely because they were concerned too much about the uberness of
their character roster, and not about the maturity of the players 
driving them.

Some of my friends have been through three to five megaguilds
already, and left them either because the "cancer" you spoke of 
drove them away, or because things had progressed so far that the
leader pulled the plug on the whole guild because it was
unsalvageable.

Meanwhile, I've been in the same guild since level 9, almost
two years ago.  We're not the most uber guild around, but
playing is always a joy because *everyone* in the guild is
chosen for their easygoing personality and sharp wit,
regardless of what type/class/level of EQ character(s) they
have.  And since we always work together smoothly and
happily, we've grown quite a stable of teammates and
EQ characters, and are constantly gaining power and
versatility to the point we can now mount some pretty impressive
raids.
