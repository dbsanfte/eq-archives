Yep you right, bards are very dynamic class characters: always 
moving while healing, buffing, meleeing, protecting, hasting, 
etc... They become very effective members in a full group.
Kill the bard and count down how much time the leftover members 
will last before running to zone. They are not group stars (perhaps 
with some of our most charismatic singing troubadours ;P) but 
really do the difference...

Do not think their melee global ability is so far from pure tanks 
one, I had the honor to follow a mid-high level bard friend (he was 
36 at this stage) from Freeport to Qeynos where I was a youngster 
and he really behaved as a crushing-machine in whole zones!

They are perhaps in top classes for soloing in EQ. Not first, but 
somewhere near that.
