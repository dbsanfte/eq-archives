If you have no target selected, then locate corpse will give you the closest
corpse.  If you know the approximate location of the body, and the area
isn't littered with the unlooted bodies of others, then you can pick it up
quickly.  Since mob bodies, bodies of people that died almost 7 days ago,
and other actual fresh rezable bodies all qualify, its hard to get this to work.

At least as a bard there's no mana involved.
