Do both of your home computers have real, external IP addresses instead of
those in 10.0.* or 192.168.* or such? If they don't have real addresses, 
it means the router is pretty much also acting as a firewall; if they do,
it might still be acting as a firewall.

Anyway, if you can connect, but it just drops you off unexpectedly at random
intervals, it's hardly a problem with how the network is set up.
