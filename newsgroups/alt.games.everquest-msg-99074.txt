First off, is it only me that feels it AWFULLY damned strange that Verant
gave druids the ability to group port (albeit intrazonely) a level before
they can SELF port??

Anyway, my real question: what's the difference between this spell and the
level 57 one?  Is it like Lesser Summoning that it can only be used by
pre-35ers?

My 52 druid has had the spell for 2 days now and still hasn't gotten around
to memming it or testing it and I KNOW I'm going to forget again tonight. :p
If the above is correct, is there ANY reason for him to mem it now? Will it
even work at all for him?
