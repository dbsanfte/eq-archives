Hello,
A long time ago, back when I used to play EQ the first time, I saw a
story online about a Dragon Hunt. It was "made up" and focused around
a group trying to work out a raid on a dragon. There were two dragons,
and this large group (or several groups) was struggling to fight one
dragon while a Necro's pet soloed the other. The Necro was sitting
back watching the group die and get res'ed while fighting the dragon.
It was really funny, but now i cannot find it.
Can anyone help??
