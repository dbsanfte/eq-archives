I posted this same strategy to somebody going on a 3 month trip not
too long ago.  It works.

Also, if you RUSH to the new zones, you'll be able to loot things on
Verant's
f'd up loot tables before the first couple of patches "fix" it.  Things like
seeing
a level 5 rogue with a pre-nerf JCP 3 days after Kunark came out will have
their own time in the sun, too.
