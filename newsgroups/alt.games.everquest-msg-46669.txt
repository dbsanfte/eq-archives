If you have telewest in you area I can kind of recommend Blueyonder.

Pros : Cheap, Broadband, 24*7 connection, not bad support
Cons : Some times flaky to the US, still some lag problems

They do have problems with their US trunk, but their web site usually
owns up and their customer support mostly knows what they are talking
about. And at the price it is great. The install is less than BT's ISDN
the lead time is much less than BT and I think the current deal is ï¿½24 a
month for 24*7 connection. 

Of course if they don't have a cable on your road you are SOL, and I
don't mean a forthcoming expansion, wait perhaps I do :-?
