That is not really true DT.  His not eating meat, makes little to no
difference in the state of the world, however, if people in general at least
cut way back on meat consumption, it would make a significant difference.
Leaving aside any issues of animals suffering and such, it takes far more in
the way of crops raised to feed animals raised for food than it does to
raise crops as food for human consumption.  I'd have to dig around for the
exact figures, but I seem to recall it was something on the order of 14 to
1.  It is also, in general, healthier to eat a balanced, largely vegetarian
diet.  Of course, the second point could result in more people living
longer, and thus exacerbating the world population problem.
