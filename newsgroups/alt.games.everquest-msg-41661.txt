I would, if I hadn't been driven from EQ by the one 
moron who named himself somethingbinladen and the 50 
idiots who took it as their personal duty to shout 
insults across the channel in ooc AND shout, and when I 
asked them to report/petition/ignore him, started 
sending *tell* messages full of insults to *me*.

Honestly, it was disgusting how many people were too 
stupid to see the troll (so to speak) in front of their 
faces.  I actually had one guy tell me he 'deserved' it.  
Deserved... all the satisfaction of completely 
disrupting the zone and upsetting everybody like he 
wanted to?  Yeah, way to go.  I'm sure the little troll 
is crying into his pillow right now.
