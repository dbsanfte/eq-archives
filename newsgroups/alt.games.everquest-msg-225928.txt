Invisibility.  Both my cleric and necromancer are dark elves, which can
occasionally make traveling places difficult since they are hated so.
Admittedly, this hasn't been too much of a problem.  PoP can get me close to
most places with ease, but when my cleric was around 25 I wanted to take him
to HHK.  I had never hunted in Highhold on any of my characters, and I had
heard it was a happening place to be.  I had two options available to me.
Rivervale book to Highpass or Freeport book to Highpass.  I deplore
halflings and have never played one or been into Rivervale, so I wasn't
really sure on how to get from where the Rivervale book dropped me off to
Kithcor, so after asking around I decided that it wasn't a good idea and my
best bet was to brave the full run through Kithcor.  I made to Highpass
alive; no harm touching death knights got my poor innocent cleric.  I was,
however, thoroughly kos to everything I could con in Highpass.  I tried
using my few invis potions to make my way as quickly as I could to the keep,
but alas my invis dropped and next thing I know there are guards chasing me.
I DA and make it back to the zone line of a very dark Kithcor.  I decided to
gate and go play in Marus Seru where guards didn't want to kill me.

Even at 65, my Necromancer goes everywhere invis.  It has become such a
habit that I put up invis before going from PoK to Shadowhaven.  Playing a
cleric has broadened my awareness of where you can and cannot go without
invisibility - useing six invis potions to run from Mons Letalis into Ssra
really makes me long for the ability to invis myself though.
