I agree with Tuv, you are being way too hard on yourself.  I am no
cleric and only played one to LVL10.  I just dont have the stomache
for it but my wife does.  We play together alot (64 chanter myself).

If you have gotten to 53 and only had 6 deaths thats amazing -
although it sounds a little boring to me!  ;-)

I have died -my chanter- probably more than 300 times in my 64 levels.
 Its no big deal at all.  Part of the job and as far as ranga's, they
die all the time too, if he isnt used to it, he is in the wrong class.
 Anyway, understand your being bothered by it but how can I say this
politely...

Find a river, build a bridge, and get over it.  Its a game, and a fun
one at that.  By the way, I have a 55 monk (LOTS of deaths), a 55
druid (some deaths, mainly solo and know how to use the gate button)
and a 52 Warrior (some deaths).  I personally am not bothered if I die
if the cleric is paying attention.  You can only do so much, have
faith in your group and when one -or more- falls, you pick them up and
keep going!

Im seriously not trying to be harsh at all, because you are concerned
about your group and that is a good thing.  Its still ok to  forgive
yourself and go play some more EQ.  No *twitch* Im not *twitch*
addicted *twitch*.
