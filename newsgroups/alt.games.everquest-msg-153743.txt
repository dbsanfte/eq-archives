What if they stated that the wood is very hard, the nail needs to go in a
specific depth, requiring force stronger than any commonly known shoes can
withstand before beginning to fall appart?

Thats why I began by saying NOT to take that as a flame.  I was sure that
they would if anything think I had a bad choice of wording, but apparently
that didn't work.  I follwed by explaining why I didn't mean it as a flame &
tried to clarify my statement.  I finished by again trying to rephrase my
question again.  So other than just a bad choice of words, what was done
wrong that would cause someone to think I had a bad attitude about the reply
in question?

What are you reffering to?  Basing his activity on his activity?  I'm not
sure what you're meaning there.  What I based his activity on was the amount
of other activity up to that point.

I never actually accused him of not reading the question.  I just asked if
he did, and stated my reason for guessing that (I even said it was a guess,
not a fact or accusation or belief).  Just a bad choice of wording?
