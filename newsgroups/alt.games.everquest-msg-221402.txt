The part thats really amazing me is how many people are throwing a hissy fit
over that.  I mean, does it really make a difference what letter the
auto-attack is mapped to when you first start?    If it's no big deal at all
to remap it so you don't hit it on accident, then why does it *become* a big
deal that new players don't have to do it anymore?
