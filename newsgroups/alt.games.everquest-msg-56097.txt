Nice, choose the races that have the highest natural stamina to compare
against.
Do it again with Ogre Warrior vs Ogre SK then Dwarf Warrior vs Dwarf Paladin
etc.

Seriously, you either didn't think to hard on this arguement or you are just
trolling.
Put Sugar Ray Robinson (one of the greatest welter/middle weight boxers of
all time) up against Lennox Lewis (one of the most mediocre Heavy Weight
champions of recent years) and I'll put my money on Lewis. Think about it,
Ogre SK vs Elf (wood or Dark) Warrior and who's gonna come out on top in a
physical contest?
