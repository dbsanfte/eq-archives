Four level 60s for a raid limited to 52 or less.  While I'd have imagined
more would be needed to fill up a screen with crap buffs before loading
on the good stuff, 4 still qualifies as a "bunch" to me.  Yes, an Uber
guild
running a Vox raid to get some of its alts their epic drops can do this
at the drop of a hat, but few "high level" guilds (ones with most of their

members in 40s and 50s... as =mains=) are going to have those 4 60s,
and if they do, just how often can you drag them to yet another "help
the lowbies kill an itty bitty dragon we can't actually attack ourselves"
raid?  They'd have to be saints, I'm a fairly giving guy but I only show
up for one or two of the "52-" dragons per month, and that out of a sense
of duty; been there, done that, and tired of running back from the
entrance cause I was buffing when the dragon decided to roar.
