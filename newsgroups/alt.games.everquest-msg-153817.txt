As I sit here wondering just how to add my less than two cents, I boggle at
my own attitude.  If you are having fun then nothing is wrong.  If you live
your life for others than it is not your life.  As I read some of the other
comments I chuckle a little bit.  Grouping can be lots of fun, but most pick
up groups are less than efficient.  Guilds can shove it up their  collective
rear ends, always someone getting too big for their britches and someone
else pouting about it.  And as far as knowing what to do and when to do it,
unless you are one of the "trinity"  how can you mess up?  Hit what the tank
is hitting, use as little mana as possible, try not to get hit unless a
weaker member is getting whupped on.  Rocket science I know.
