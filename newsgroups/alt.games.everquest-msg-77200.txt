I spent about 2 hours in ECommons last night getting my enchanter to 13. She
was having trouble the night before and I couldn't figure out what I was
doing wrong. "With the thread on Dusting off My Enchanter", I finally
figured it out. Just wanted to say thanks to everyone who posted and made
comments -- it really helped me getting spells straight again!

Thanks for playing.
