Just my thoughts real quick.  I for one am in the taunt adds hate
category.  It seems, to me at least, with the spells that are out that
adds/subracts hate from a MOB's hate list, it would seem logical to work
in that same fashion.  I know I am just about to pull a MoB off of someone
when they turn for that split second to smack me, then turn around and
beat on that same person.  I know that my rating is now high enough that
it is rivaling the person origionally being beat on, with a few more
taunts and hits, that MoB is mine.

Just my thoughts.
