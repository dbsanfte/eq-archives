There are any number of mobs you can kill to raise that faction I am 
fairly certain.  Try killing a lot of Sarnaks in OT, maybe in Howling 
Stones too.  I can't check allakhazam right now, so can't verify any of 
this.  My VS faction is never likely to be above KOS, I have spent far 
too much time playing with goons, cliff golems, General V'Deers, and 
other denizens of the outpost in OT.
