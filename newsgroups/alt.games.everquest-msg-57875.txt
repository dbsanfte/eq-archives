Lol, 'THE' uber mob of Everquest.   Look through some recent posts for the
storyline.. but basically a dragon is imprisoned and guarded by 4 warders.

When the 4th warder is killed, a one time only event happens on that
server... the Sleeper is woken, proceeds to wipout the raid who killed the
warders, then zones though Velious clearing every mob and person in there.

He is currently unkillable, can only be woken once, and only rampages once
per server.  The warders never respawn, so its a kinda historic event for
servers..
