a couple things to try
1) Run scandisk and defrag your hard drive (Close any open programs or virus
scanners, Open My Computer, right click drive c, go to tools)
2) get your latest video and sound drivers
3) make sure you didnt pick too many things to load (new models and stuff)
4) Try re-installing windows, that helps me sometimes, not often, but when
it works its worth it....
Hope that helps
