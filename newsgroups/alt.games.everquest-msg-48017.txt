Much to my surprise, I recently got abjuration (1)
Since my DS is an abjuration, this explains why I've been
fizzling so much!  Solution, though, isn't to dump a bunch
of practice points in, its to chain cast it on some newbies,
preferably ones doing something that gives me faction
hits I like.

The Dervs are quite soloable one at a time, and Harmony means never
having to fight more than one!  If you have trouble with the Thugs, just
don't pull them, the rest of the spawn will still be your meat, and the only
thing you lose is one of the spawn spots.  If someone shows up that wants
to group with you, then you've got the tougher prey all saved up!

I was thinking of going there, but I decided to leave it till I get bind
affinity,
and SOW for that matter.  I'm not partial to looking for a bind in Neriak,
after all.

Instead, I'm doing top floor of Runnyeye.  Advantage is that I've never
been in that zone in my life, so its all new to me, and it looks like if I
wanted to I could stay till 30.  Its handy to a druid trainer and spell
vendor, too, all I have to do is turn the sound off while in the happy
funtime music zone.
