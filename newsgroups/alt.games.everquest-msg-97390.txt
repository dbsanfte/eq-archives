Let's check your reasons...

Correct.

You're right in that you couldn't apply a constant, but
you could certainly apply a shifting multiplier.  Start
with:

    OLDEXP(n) = amount of exp it currently takes
                to get through level "n".

Decide on:

    NEWEXP(n) = amount of exp it would take to get through
                level "n" under an "ideal" exp curve
                that has no hell levels, but which
                has the same exp from 1-50 as the
                old (current) 1-50 curve.

(Actually, for 10-50, since they've said they're speeding
up the trip from 1-10 somewhat -- but this method can
accommodate that easily without extra code, just lower
the "NEWEXP" table entries for 1-10, and it all works out.)

Calculate:

   MULT(n) = OLDEXP(n)/NEWEXP(n) = multiplier for
               level "n" which, when applied to each
               dose of exp as you earn it, would make
               your leveling act as if it were calculated
               using the NEWEXP curve instead of the OLDEXP
               curve.

Note that the MULT table is pre-calculated once, takes
up only 60 slots of memory, applies to all classes/races,
and would be pre-programmed into the server code.  It
doesn't need to be recalculated on the fly, it's just a
single table lookup (based on level) which yields the
multiplier to be applied to any exp you earn.

It works in pretty much the same way as the "class-based
penalty nullifier" multipliers that they already added
to the code, and in fact would be applied at the same
places in the code, making it easy for the programmers
to ensure that they've got all the cases covered (just
repeat what they had done previously, in the same
spots).
              
It would work just fine.

10-50, you mean.  The only 1-30 exp change is for
dungeons, which will be handled via the ZEM (Zone
Experience Modifier) code, not the "every time you
get exp" code.

No, it wouldn't change the amount of required kills,
because the multipliers for the non-hell levels would end
up being less than 1, while the multipliers for the
current hell levels would be greater than 1.  Over 10-50,
they would average out the same.

That would have been the method I would have chosen to
do remove the hybrid exp penalties as well, *but* they
chose not to handle it that way.  From what I've gathered,
the reasons were:

1.  It would take a hell of a long time to process the
character databases for literally millions of characters
and twiddle absolutely everyone's current exp numbers.

2.  It would just be asking for trouble, like corrupted
databases, messed-up exp numbers for some people, etc.
For example, what happens if the computer crashes while
it's halfway through diddling the character records?

3.  Restores would be a nightmare.  Every time someone's
character had a problem and had to be restored from a
pre-tweak backup, the restore process would have to
re-tweak their exp on the fly.

I'm sure there are other reasons I haven't heard about.

For whatever reason, they decided that an "as you earn it"
multiplier kludge was the most desirable way to handle
the class-based exp penalties, instead of doing it the
way the you have suggested.   Thus, I'd be willing to bet
that they'll be handling the "reshaping" of the level
curve the same way.

Additionally, having 60 separate level-exp multipliers
already programmed in will then give them future flexibility
to easily tweak the level curve any time they feel like
it, which would not be the case if they had just
"reset" everyone's exp to fit a new curve.
