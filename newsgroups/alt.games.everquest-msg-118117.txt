Is a quest in town with one of the merchants for turning in bear
pelts of some kind and orc bracers too.  Used to be able to turn in
quest items like that while invis (did it with my necromancer) but
since the recent change I am not sure you have any hope.

I would love to see several NPC's that are indifferent to everyone,
have one of them on every old world town faction and have them give
some kind of turn-in-for-faction type quest  for those that want to
do it.  Could even lower faction with some at same time to make it a
real challenge to have a dubious or indifferent faction with all the
old world towns if for some reason that trips your trigger.  Mostly
though the old world faction becomes a non-issue as you progress in
the game, but who am I to judge?  If some want to work on all the
old world factions by all means give them the chance even if they
have to turn in 10,000 bear pelts not to hear "Into the fray come
the Wolves of the North!" "Cut you down I will!"  every time they
see a Barbarian NPC.
