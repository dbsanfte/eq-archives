Either way they are out of stock now. If they did have some then it must 
have been from old stock they had as Ubisoft are not distributing it in 
the UK (EQ Deluxe that is) and as I understand it companies are not 
allowed to import it to the UK for distribution. As opposed to us 
importing it for ourselves.
