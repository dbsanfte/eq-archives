Used to be there were a couple of quests you could do.
In the library in the third gate you can hand in red wine to the
scribe that is in one of the separate rooms to up your faction with
just about every faction in neriak.  
In s.ro you can give light stones and greater light stones to one of
the vendors in the desert.  (smith if I remember correctly) and at
least one of your factions will go up.  The up side of this is you get
a research item that you can immediately sell back.
My iksar can shop and use the bank in neriak now.  there are some
specific factions ( the dark clerics) that still don't like me.
