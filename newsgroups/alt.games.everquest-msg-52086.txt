I think making the statement explicitly looks like little more than
begging with some tact.

If its your intent to farm freebies, the trick would be to put on
a low level set of gear, and then go offer the SOW freebies
without any "few possessions" comment.  People can easily
recognize low level gear, and will if so inclined inspect and see
just that.

Without the intent to cash in, my cleric has always found that
the rewards of free res far outweight those of someone offering
res for hire... but they are very sporadic, and still never have
competed with using the same time and mana in a productive
camp over the long run.

The best reward of free res is in the wealth of free SOW,
Clarity, Ports, and the like that this generates; essentially you
join the communtity of people who do things for each other
simply because they can, rather than because they want
something in return.

My druid specializes in the drive by SOW; if he's passing by
and doesn't have something chasing him, like as not he'll stop
and SOW you, then run off before you could buff him or
offer up some cash.  People are a little confused by this,
expecting, I suppose, some sort of quid pro quo... but
SOW costs little mana and is so very useful... the only
thing to look out for are the odd Bard or bard groups,
who find SOW to be the equivalent of downshifting their
lambourgini into second gear while running at 260mph.

Has this paid off?  Nope, not a bit.  Never seen any loot
or cash out of this approach... but then its deliberately
done in such a way as to minimize that, and he's also
visibly twinked out and occaisionally auctioning to sell
500pp plus value items.
