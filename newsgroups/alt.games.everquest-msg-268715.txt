Not So. My Iksar Warrior reached 47 soloing and I can easily, albeit 
slowly, foresee reaching 51 at his current location, the 3 spawn 
Forest Giant camp in FV. With J-Boots, he can "SoW" pull singles and 
if trouble occurs, the SoNH zone line is within easy reach. After 51, 
there is a 2 spawn Sonic Wolf camp just across the bridge from the 
outpost in Grimling Forest and to the right that can take him to 54 
very safely. Be prepared for very slow going there however.
