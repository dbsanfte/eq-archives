The plan is certainly to never allow melee from the mob. That's SOP for 
any mage killing effort I've ever been in, I'm no shaman (and I do have 
a 52 shaman, so I know a completely different way to kill things with 
pets there...)

If the mobs never hit you, then how much damage they do per hit is 
irrelevant.

That said, I've been attacked a number of times as a mage in a kiting 
group in the same spot, and only died from it twice, both times because 
I was on a drogmar and couldn't get moving fast enough when I realized I 
was being hit.  With this kiting plan, I don't intend to have the mount 
up so there won't be that annoying "accelleration" phase to deal with.

And -that- said, with a 96% rez (which seems to be available just about 
any time in a planes GY) will I really care that much if I die a time or 
two?

25K hp is a bit more annoying, especially since I won't be nuking, just 
relying on the pet's melee plus backstab.  However, 57 levels of 
experience as a bard have taught me that I can run in circles for 5 
minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes... whatever it takes, just keep running 
in a circle.  At least the HOH GY is nice and level with no obstructions 
and no potential adds to avoid.

I think its feasible... but I don't know that the exp per hour will be 
worth the trouble, if I wanted to run circles for 15 minutes at a time, 
I could be playing my bard and getting killing 10 mobs in the same time 
span!

Splendid
