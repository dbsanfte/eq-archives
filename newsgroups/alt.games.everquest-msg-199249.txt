Guess what, even with KEI, we still sit, although admittedly, we don't have 
to look at the spell book anymore.  There was a time when you had to look 
at the spell book all the way up to level 50 too, and Clarity was the only 
mana regen spell in the game.

Wow, how did I ever make it past level 14?  The only one of my characters 
that has had KEI more than once is my 61 shaman.  First time I got KEI was 
at level 57 or so.  I never pay for KEI for my low levels.  KEI is just 
plain sick on low level characters.

Wow, how did I ever manage to solo in PoN without KEI?  Much less, crawl 
PoI with me and a 51 shaman as the healers in the group, and none of us 
with KEI.

You are underestimating how fast you can go down there.  Big difference 
between healing a shaman and healing a tank.  For the Tank, time the CHeal 
to land somwhere safe, for the shaman, first off, don't use Cheal, toss a 
fast lower hp heal on him.

I love having KEI, it means I can do more, but, believe it or not, I can 
exist just fine with out it, it just means I have to be more conservative 
with mana, and, likely have more downtime.

There is no question at all that having KEI means you can take on more mobs 
faster, but, you are not helpless without it.
