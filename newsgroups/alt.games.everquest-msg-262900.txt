*shrug*
I've been playing computer games for 3 decades and I never heard of
Scott Adams until this thread.  OTOH, I did know of PLATO (via the
U of Minnesota where my father worked as a computer scientist thru
the early-70s), although I never got a chance to play with it.

Of course, I never liked those text-based adventure games (I assume
that's what you're talking about) or the "interactive novels" they
were derived from, so maybe that's why I never heard of the guy (or
forgot about him as uninteresting/unimportant, heh).
