Nah, it's not that at all. I just don't want to deprive myself yet again of 
the pleasure of actual character development with regard to my gear. With 
my previous alts, I would roll them up, grab several kpp from the shared 
bank fund and twink them at least that much in the Bazaar. As such, it was 
a very long time before they ever saw a drop they could actually use. It 
became all about the money at that point, because if I wanted anything 
better, I had no choice but to buy it.

Truth be told, I didn't really *need* anything better for the most part, 
but I have to admit, gear upgrades are part of the fun IMO. I had basically 
removed that aspect from most of the game as I had ever experienced it.

It already seems like a breath of fresh air, and I'm having a great time. 
There's a little less concern with levelling and I'm enjoying the little 
things like I haven't in a long time.
