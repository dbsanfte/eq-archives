Also most group buffs act like auras in Diablo2 or bard songs in EQLive.  
If you or your party members are separated by a large enough distance 
buffs start dropping.  This isn't too big of a problem and adds a small 
benifit.  When new members join or party members are rez'ed group buffs from 
other members are added automaticaly.

Granted, this is all information gathered on single-group post-beta experience.
I'm unclear exactly how buffs function in a raiding environments.
