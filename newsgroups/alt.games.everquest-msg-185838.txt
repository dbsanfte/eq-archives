I'd like to see some incentive to trade in cities, just to bring them to
life a bit.  Either trading stalls like the Bazaar, or just the /trader,
right-clickable part, or (least fav choice) make standing around in the
bazaar cost a small amount of money.  I understand the comment about not
wanting to have to go all over to make a purchase - perhaps only one trading
area per continent/world would address this somewhat.  However, not only
would this add some interesting twists to pricing, but I think it's more
"realistic" that a world the size of EQ would have a few satellite trading
areas in addition to it's big central hub.  Also, the hassle would be worth
it (to me) if I saw a city or two brought back to life.

Since I never played pre-luclin, I don't know what is was like without the
bazaar.  Did everyone /auc all over the place, or were there places traders
congregated?  Do any trading hot spots exist on any servers outside the
Bazaar today?
