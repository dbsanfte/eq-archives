Have you found any good places to solo at 65? Not that I solo much any
more, seems like there's always at least one person I know that's
around and looking to at least duo. Still, finding a spot in Tier3 PoP
(which I assume since you're talking 5% AA per kill) that even your
average duo can take without having to split mobs seems pretty
difficult. HoH seems impossible to reliably pull singles, BoT is a
madhouse. ... Tactics maybe if you hunt the ogres? They mitigate slow
but BoS and Ulthor make rotting viable again, much as I hate it after
soloing for 60 lvls IN TEH FACE. <g> 

Droga might be another option. Given the right camps, exp there seems
every bit as good as HoH or BoT. One AA in a bit less than 2 hours. I
did try ChardokB recently, solo'd for maybe 45 minutes while waiting
for the rest of the group to get online and down there but it would've
taken be about 5 hours to get an AA there, hardly efficient.
