Or a benefit, if you prefer grouping.  Games where soloing is anywhere near as
efficient as grouping tend to have very little chance to form solid groups and
depend on each other.  I'd rather group, and I prefer a game which encourages
it.

I haven't seen that much two-boxing.  There's some, and there's a lot of duos
and trios (and full groups and guilds...) that are comprised of people who
already know each other and are not looking to add members.  I generally don't
have trouble finding a group when I play, though, among strangers or friends.

You're correct, though: soloing is not the focus of the game, and it's far
less rewarding than grouping.

True for raids, I've never seen this happen for groups.

I blame the players who get caught up in it far more than the game designers.
Sony (and Verant before them) has done many things I think are dumb, but a
whole lot of people got their epics as part of an ongoing guild, which they
stayed with for many years afterward.

Good luck over there, I hope you find what you're looking for.
