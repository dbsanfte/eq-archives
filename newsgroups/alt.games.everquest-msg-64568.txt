I don't have SoL yet, but I figured I'd poke around in the game a bit
tonight, as a break from programming.

Patcher worked fine. Took about three minutes on my cable modem. Glad
I waited until everyone else was in bed :)

No problem with the video card. The game required me to verify which
of my one cards I wanted to use, but it recognized and used it just
fine.

Is it my imagination, or when the world is loading initially, is one
of the little tiny messages that goes by something like "Adding
randomly misspelled words"? That's sure what it looked like. I'll pay
closer attention next time.

I saw only two new models - the wolf (and thus wolf form) and the
skeletons. Both are excellent, IMO.

The new ground textures in a few places are subtle, but nice. I wasn't
actually sure I was seeing a difference at first.

I noticed slightly longer zone loading times, but that could just as
easily be from my recent AT&T cable modem problems.

The maximum clipping place seems to have been increased. I noticed it
especially in S. Karana.

There is a definite choppiness in a few places, notably the tunnel in
Rivervale. Also, there seems to be a tiny lag in reaction to mouse
movements.

To my surprise, sound has been greatly improved (using a Turtle Beach
Santa Cruz under Win2k). Not perfect, but the volume levels seem to be
evened out (no more blowing my eardrums out when I get hit), no
static, and the stereo imaging is on target. Heck, I might start to
play with the sound on again.

Overall, aside from some obvious need for tweaking, what I've seen so
far looks good.
