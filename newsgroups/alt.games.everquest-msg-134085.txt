DON'T SAY THAT!!!!!  Actually, Black ICE isn't a bad firewall, if you know
what you're doing with it.  If you don't, then it stops you from getting
your new dynamic IP, FTP'ing, and just about whatever else you might be
trying to do.  When that thing first came out, out of about 300 known
customers that had it, probably 4 set it up correctly.

The other 296, if someone sneezed on their same subnet then BlackICE
screamed about them being hacked.  Major pain in the ass when you're trying
to explain that No, our DHCP server is NOT trying to steal pictures of your
grandkids playing at the park.  All it is trying to do is allow you to renew
your IP, so you can send said pictures to your entire family.  Try telling
that to a paranoid 65 year old that just got their computer the month
before, and read an article about hackers in the Readers Digest.
