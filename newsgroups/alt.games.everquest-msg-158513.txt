Jazz I think you were Power levelled one too many times and missed the value
of this little damage shield.  By putting O'Keills Radiation up it stops you
getting first hit damage when quadding. And yes it does give a measly five
point damage to the mob.

The point is that while quadding if I make a turn too quickly the O'Keills
takes the damage from me and puts 5 back on the mob.  The mob's second hit
will damage you normally but if you are turning you will be out of range of
that unless they manage to stun.  This is a great combo spell for Wizzies
with no component required for the Lev.  Try it when quadding you will eat
your words.
