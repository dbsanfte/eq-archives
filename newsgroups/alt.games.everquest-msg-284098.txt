Have you heard: "An Adventurer's stone? What is that?"  haaaaaaa...

Yes, we have been trying to do as you suggest. But there are times when we 
do a pick up group, and there always seems to be at least ONE "cephaloe" who 
jumps in the Ldon and starts the clock too soon, or makes us all wait 
forever, or ignores the pre-game instructions of who has what duty. (I am 
often annoyed by those who want to keep looting as if they are worried they 
will not get their split!)

In our Ldons, my husband pulls and I pacify. It works well, since we can 
communicate better since we sit side by side. He sometimes is the MT, 
depending on who else is in the grp. I also loot and heal. I've found it 
works best when we have strong fighters who drop the mobs quickly. We had a 
rogue the other night that was just perfect. He disarmed traps, would sneak 
around and tell what was coming up, and his backstabbing skill sent mobs 
flying! We have an excellent Shammy that often grps with us, who does a 
little of it all... DoTs and buffs and helps with heals in tense situations. 
When a group works together, we rawk! :)

I guess that's why I get so annoyed when we find a group member who seems 
selfish and does not want to work as a TEAM. I feel sony made each character 
with unique capabilities to help each other out. And when you get a group of 
6 together that share that view, they are unstoppable!
