You got on the wrong boat.

Facing the ocean, go to the dock on the right and wait for a very large boat to
come in to port.  Sails and everything.  Much much bigger than the four little
barges you hopped on to get to Timorous Deep.

That boat will set sail after sitting for a couple minutes, you'll zone in to
the Ocean of Tears.  The boat will travel a bit, pull up to a dock and stop for
a short rest (this is "brother island"), then move on thru the zone, eventually
(I want to say 15 minutes but I could be hallucinating) zoning again into East
Freeport.  Stay on the boat and it will pull up to a dock, thats Freeport.
Assuming you aren't "evil" you can walk right in safe as houses.  If you are
having trouble with the locals, its possible to jump ship and swim to some
tunnels that lead under the city, which may or may not be safer.

Other notes; the Timorous Deep barge you took stops out in TD for a while and
then eventually an even bigger ship than the Freeport one shows up, you get on
-that- and ride it for a bit and eventually zone in to Firiona Vie, pause a bit
then move to a dock there.  That boat will wait there a bit, then move back
into Timorous Deep, travel a bit, stop and wait for a similar little boat to
the BB-TD one, but which will take you to an elven outpost in TD.  Stay on the
ship and eventually it will move again, next time it stops its waiting for the
boat back to BB this time.

Stay on the BB-Freeport ship at the freeport dock and it will after a minute or
two move back to the Ocean of Tears for the return voyage, this time it will
stop at a different island, "sister isle", then move off to a long sea voyage
culminating in zoning back to Butcherblock.

Also, thats not a dwarf city you've found there in Butcherblock, its just a
little outpost around the dock.  The city, Kaladim, is also reached from BB,
but is a seperate zone (two actually), and its a lot bigger.  Since its dug in
under a mountain, running boats out of it seems like an exercise in futility,
not that dwarves are above such things.

Lets see, what else.  In Oasis there's a raft that leads out to a different
island in Timorous Deep, where docks a different ship which will take you to
Overthere.  And in Timorous Deep there's a room in a far off corner, where
you'll find firepots that will port you to most races starting cities (not
Qeynos, nor Shar Val)  In Qeynos there's a ship that leads thru Erud's Crossing
to Erudin, and then back, in one of the two directions stopping at an island in
the crossing (I forget which way)  And in North Ro there's a dock with a raft
that will take you to a tiny island in Iceclad Ocean where docks a steamship
that will take you to a dock in the same zone far faster than you can swim the
distance.

Thats about it for boats (well there's one across the lake in Hallas...)  Later
we'll discuss the Luclin portal system, the POK book system, and player Ports.
