Oh, a nicely laid trap you have set.  By using "an" instead of "and" in
your first sentence you may lead folks into assuming that was your
mistake.  Of course we all know that the real mistake would be including
"go and" at all as the sentence reads better with nothing there.  Please
note, I am  not pointing out your mistake so much as praising your trap.
