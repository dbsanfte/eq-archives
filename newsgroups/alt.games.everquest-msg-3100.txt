I changed my screen resolution to 1024 x 768 a week ago and after playing it
a  few times I just don't like it, now here's my problem.
I go into Options / Display and under resolution it shows 800 x 600, when I
click on it the screen goes blank and I get a warning message...

    Eqgame has caused an error in eqgame.exe.
    Eqgame will now shutdown.

    If you continue to experience problems.
    try restarting your computer.

and then I get kicked to Desktop. I've restarted and still the same thing.

I'm running WinMe, Explorer 5.5, and using a Voodoo 2 and Intel 740 Graphics
cards.
Any Ideas?

Thanks
