Real Easy solution in Win2k...

CTRL + ALT + DELETE -> click task manager -> right click 'Everquest.exe' ->
click 'Maximize'

Allows me to AOL Im my GF while playing EQ on Win2k. Everquest still keeps
all keystrokes so using AOL while in EQ can have wierd results. and there
are other 'glitches' that I've been able to work through with a little trial
and error. But Task Manager 'Maximize' is the #1 reason I love my Win2k heh
