I'm a professional.

That means I do it for a living, which is to my way of thinking the best 
possible qualification.  If I do a bad job, I can't support myself at 
it.  No degree or certificate in the world can change that, my customers 
aren't interested in paper, they want steel. Lifetime warantee against 
breakage in combat, that helps keep me honest, can't cheat when I know 
if I do I'll be having to do it over, and do it right this time.

I know quite a few blacksmiths and farriers, and some knife makers, but 
not many sword makers at all, its a bit of a pain at times, I get to 
hear about damascus and O2 and 1095 till its coming out of my ears, as 
though characteristics appropriate for katanas, socket wrenches, and 
hunting knives are really ideal for broadswords and claidhmore.

I dropped out of colledge a year from completing a double major; 
philosophy and computer science with a minor in math, hitchiked around 
the country till I stumbled across a renaissance festival, started 
working hawking food and cooking, got a manager position, became half 
owner of a food business, then added the forge and a fight game, and 
then got out of the food business.

I started forging weapons just hanging out with a friend during the 
week, and took over his business when his CPA business got to be a full 
time affair; 9 years later I'm still having a great time at it, I 
suppose if people stopped buying swords I could always finish my degree 
and go back to programming supercomputers to solve modal logic problems 
via brute force tautologies and helping liason between the DOE and the 
FSU high energy physics department... which is what I'd been doing to 
pay for school before I dropped out.  (I might be a little out of date 
on the programming part though, they come up with anything new since 1986?)

Oh, I forgot to mention the 6 months in the  CIA, if you call the
personnel department they'll tell you I worked for the personnel
department, which of course is the same thing they'll say of every
other former "company man" who's record is public.

My father's career was far more varied and interesting than mine, 
though; forest ranger, BS in cartography, Jump Sergeant, CIA (personnel 
department, says here), State department, consultant, ship's captain; 
hopefully there will be some more sudden left turns in the next 30 
years, hate to let the side down.
