The general concensus at www.monkly-business.com is that there "used
to be" a soft cap of 1100AC (on monks at least). Since the release of
Velious the general view is that cap was removed and and the more AC
the better (with the exception of raids the require specific resists).

Wish I could be more specific, but I have seen nothing official on the
subject posted anywhere.

Cheers
