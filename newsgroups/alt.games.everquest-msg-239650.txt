PvP castles or PvE castles... for me Shadowbane was a bust because I
went on vacation for a week came back and found the city I belonged to
burnt to the ground...

Its one thing to take part in a war, and even lose one, you can feel

contributing to something only to find it completely destroyed while
you were offline.
