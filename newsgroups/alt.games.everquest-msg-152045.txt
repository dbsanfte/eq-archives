Actually, I believe it is just the channelling skill.  The skill level in
the appropriate area of magic is used for fizzles, among other factors.  As
far as the interrupts, there are a couple of possibilities.  The server may
not have realized you stopped.  Try stopping, and turning in place a bit.  I
do that, and count two seconds usually before casting, almost never see an
interrupt that way.  Another possibility is if you are on a slope, then you
can often have problems where it thinks you are moving, and interrupts your
spells.
