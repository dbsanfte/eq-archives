I'm setting up a necro for soloing during those thin
times when nobody wants a cleric to group with.
(Yes, clerics can solo, but cleric soloing tactics get
dull quickly. And by swapping between the two,
eventually I can be corpsemeister.)

So I'm trying to figure out the best race to play with.
I see the pros and cons as follows...

Iksar: Exp penalty. High regen -> mana regen later on; high AC. Low INT.
Lousy faction. Dark vision (I think). More equipment doesn't fit.
Human: Exp bonus (I think). Low INT.
Gnome: Exp bonus. Decent INT. Dark vision.
Erudite: excellent INT. Apparently some interesting starting quests.
Dark Elf: Decent INT. Dark vision.

I'm figuring the regen on Iksars compensates for the
exp penalties but I don't know about the rest of it. Comments?

Note that this will pretty much be a solo-only character,
if that matters at all.

Also, if anyone can suggest low-level twink gear for a necro (say
100-200pp to spend) any suggestions would be appreciated.

        ...Ronny
