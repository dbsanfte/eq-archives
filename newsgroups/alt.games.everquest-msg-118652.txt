Right, root rotting is what shamans should do instead of kiting. I find that
I never have enough time to let off my DD before the mob catches up to me
and gives me a good whack; it's not a problem with run speed but rather with
DD range and casting time. But if I place disease and poison on him and then
just run around with him following me, that's not root rotting because the
mob isn't rooted. Again, shamans should not try kiting unless they're a
troll with that Clinging Darkness clicky item someone pointed out to me.
Root rot instead.
