I appreciate the response and have a question regarding Heart Flutter
and Heat Blood.   Heart Flutter is a higher level spell, but you
recommend using Heat Blood as first choice?  Is there a reason, or was
it just a mix up?

Heat Blood Single Target Fire Based DoT (Max: 170) 	72 mana
Heart Flutter Single Target Disease Debuff DoT (Max: 144)   80 mana

well I guess I just answered my own question, but I find it rather Odd
that  Higher spell uses more mana and gives less damage.  Very odd
indeed.  I also would have thought that the Disease based spell would
do more damage just for the sheer fact of coming from a necro...
Disease and poison are in our blood if you will.  Where as fire based
would be more of a Wizard / Magi thing.  (just another opinion of mine
of course).
