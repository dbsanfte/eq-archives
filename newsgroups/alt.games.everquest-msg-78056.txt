The only direct way is to go near a creature that is on that
faction group, target it, then hit "c" (for "consider").

It will give a message indicating how the creature considers
you ("scowling, ready to attack", "indifferent", "apprehensive",
"warmly", etc.), and also how likely you are to prevail if you
try to attack it ("what would you like your tombstone to say",
etc.)

The actual messages, from worst to best, are:

    ...scowls at you, ready to attack
    ...glares at you threateningly
    ...glowers at you dubiously
    ...looks your way apprehensively
    ...regards you indifferently
    ...judges you amiably
    ...kindly considers you
    ...looks upon you warmly
    ...regards you as an ally

The first two, "scowling" and "glaring", are often
called "KoS", for "Kill on Sight", because that's what
the creature will do the moment it notices you if you
get too close -- it will attack and try to kill you.
All other categories mean that it is safe for you to
approach the creature, it will not attack you.

In order to interact with a merchant, you have to
have "apprehensive" or better standing with them.
