I made the mistake of using my EQ Gold CD Key to add Luclin and PoP to
my Trilogy installation, thus actually using 2 Keys (plus LoY) to have
one full installation on one system. I currently have everything
installed on both systems but can only use a single account. It looks
like I will have to buy another copy of Gold to enable a second
account on the old computer, AND then order another copy of LoY with
the new account to have both systems concurrent. Phew, that's a lot of
money, not to mention having to get a new video card.
