Why? I've rooted and dotted until I've been sick of it, and I've always 
found a lot more inconvenient to do it on horseback than simply sitting 
down as needed, what with the inertia, the inability to interrupt spells (
having to interrupt a DoT, particularly a long-ass one like the Epic, 
when root breaks early is par for the course when root-dotting) and the 
general pain-in-the-arse-ness of being on a horse.

Well, yeah. That's basically the only instances where I've used my horse 
regularly.
