Welcome back.  Since you installed Luclin, the first stop
to make is the Nexus and Bazaar.  If you didn't buy PoP, the
way there is to run to North Karana to the wizard spires
by the stone bridge (just follow the coast through West
Karana and North Karana - can't miss 'em).  Once there,
talk to the Nexus Scion.

The Nexus has ports to and from Toxx Forest on Odus, 
Greater Faydark, Dreadlands on Kunark and the Great
Divide on Velious, as well as North Karana.

If you take the south tunnel out of the Nexus you
will be in the Bazaar.  Type /bazaar and explore :)

I had a 19th shaman way back in the early Kunark 
days, and some of the weapons that I used to drool
over and dream of owning back then are available
VERY cheap nowadays.

If you installed PoP, your next stop should be
the Plane of Knowledge - go back to the nexus and
take the west tunnel - at the cave in there is a
book - click it - have fun exploring.  Please note,
you will not be attacked by anything in PoK.

Also, some of us in this newsgroup join a cross-server
chat channel.  type /join serverwide.age:age and say
hi.

I'm Mairelon in game, on Lanys.

Mairelon, Arch Mage of The Coalition of Power.
