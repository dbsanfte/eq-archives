For almost forever, a subquest item in the Paladin
Soulfire quest was labeled in the game as
"Token of Generousity".

To make matters worse, in order to trigger the
next part of the quest, you had to tell the NPC,
"I have the Token of Generosity" (spelled right).

Imagine the poor schmucks who kept double-checking
the name of the item, and carefully telling the
NPC, "I have the Token of Generousity", then tearing
their hair out because it wasn't working.

They finally fixed it, thank Brell.

They also finally got around to fixing the
name of the Armor of Ro subquest item,
"Soil of Underfooot" [sic].
