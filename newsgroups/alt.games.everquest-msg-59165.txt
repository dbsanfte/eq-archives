  Before petitioning (assuming you already haven't) one thing you might want
to try is to just type /corpse anywhere in the OoT zone (preferably on dry
land, off the boat)... it just might work and summon your corpse.

  In the most recent patch they apparently implemented some code that was
designed to save the staff and players some time by making it not necessary
for a GM to come to pull a corpse out of a wall.  Now when the system
detects a corpse is in an "invalid location" (I think dying on a boat might
end up making your corpse appear in an 'invalid location') your body is
teleported to the "default coordinates" of the zone.  If your body is on the
default coordinates, you can summon it from anywhere in the zone.

  It's something to try, anyway. :)
