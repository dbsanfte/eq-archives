You probably can't do it solo, but I'd be surprised if you couldn't
find someone to help you in each spot, especially during the weekend,
unless you play only when the server is deserted.  Many of the spots
had a lot of people killing things when I did the quest (not all,
Ocean of Tears was almost deserted, for instance), and on a weekend
there should be even more.  It will take longer, but there are plenty
of people willing to help lowbies if it doesn't take long, and none of
these items are very rare.
