up to 130ish costs a touch more for someone in the 100-150 int/wis/key stat
range.. maybe 20%?

beyond that the costs are incredible. There's this rogue who is big into
tradeskills, just like me. We were doing fletching together. I hit 120 or so
about 5 min before her, and went to get a drink.  Leisurely combining and
chatting, when I hit 180 she was still in the 140 or 150s and had spent
almost twice money than I had! I hit 200 that night, I think she ran out of
cash (even though I gave her my remaining 'crafting money' after I hit 200)
around 170. We had started with about the same amount of money, had good
faction and chr, but my int was in the 230 range, hers was about 150 with my
buffs.
