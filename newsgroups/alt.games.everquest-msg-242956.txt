No need to port to CS anymore since the last Plane of Mischief revamp,
at least if you're level 46+. Just follow the river south in the Great
Divide until it ends where there is a tiny castle in the water. Click
it and you zone into PoM. There's nothing dangerous at the zonein.

The zoneout is a tree you click on that brings you to Cobalt Scar.
Problem is, it looks just like any other tree. To find the correct one
turn around slowly while mashing the U button (use) until you get the
message that you're too far away to use that object. You're now facing
the correct tree. Once you find and click the tree you'll pop in the
middle of the water in CS. Swim up to the surface and head east and
you'll get to the Othmir camp. It helps to have levitation at this
point so you can run over the water, especially if you get aggrod by
sharks (who aren't that dangerous but can be a nuisance if you're
swimming).

Also pray that Kelorek'Dar, the sea dragon of Cobalt Scar, isn't up
and takes an interest in you. The chance isn't that great, as he is
an easy kill with a loots that sell well in bazaar and has a long
spawn timer, and even if he is up he probably will not swim past
and see you.
