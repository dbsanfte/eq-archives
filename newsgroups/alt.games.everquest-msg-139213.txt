I agree completely. I'd be surprised if VI did that.

On the other hand, and forgive me wizzies, but I hope that they do. I
am bound in the Nexus and heaven help me if I change my bind point. I
bound myself in PoM recently so I could explore that zone. That lasted
one whole day before I gave up and rebound myself in the Nexus. 

Over 50% of my guild members are bound in the Nexus or hunting in
Luclin. Rapid mobilization to a target of opportunity is impossible
using the spires. Porters have no choice but to bind in the Nexus.
It's not a huge deal, it's just one of those Vision(tm)-inspired
timewasters that are so prevalent in EverQuest, and Luclin in
particular.

An intra-Luclin port to DSP isn't necessary. A Grimling port would be
okay but I'd only use it to check on the burrower in AC. A TS port
would be good for those who hunt in Katta or SD I suppose.
