Close to it.  Check it out.  It's amazing.

He can handle a couple rounds.  Though I admit I look at this from the
perspective of a 65 ranger with a lot more HP.

Last time I bothered to check it, the mob was running around 350 with
chanter haste.

With limited room it makes more sense to have the mob circling the
charmer while the charmer casts charm than for the charmer to kite it
away far enough that s/he can tash (I assumed this was a chanter when
I first responded) and recharm, hopefully not get adds, and hopefully
not mis-time the spells.

As I stated when I immediately responded after posting this, I mistook
this for a Chanter, not a Druid.

Yes, I made a mistake.  Thank you for pointing out the mistake I made
after I pointed it out myself 10 seconds after posting this.
