I am going to be heading back home from an overseas deployment where I
couldn't play everquest.  Since my deployment, Shadows of Luclin came
out as well as Dark ages of Camelot by Mythic.  I have been doing some
research on both games and I have two questions

1. What are the system requirements to run Shadows of Luclin properly
on my computer. Specifically How much RAM and what processor speed
would I need to have.

2. I know that this is probably a controversial topic, but Would I be
better off trying out DAoC?

thanks

Scott
