In final fantasy, you can help fine. He just has to call for help.
Also, you can heal/buff without trouble.

Now in EQ2, you can't even heal or buff someone else in a fight. Though 
again they can call for help if they need it.

which works just like FF call for help: no loot, no xp, but you are alive.
