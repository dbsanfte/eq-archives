Depends how wreckless, adventurous one is. But I must agree even as a 
provisioner it is pretty annoying if you lose for eg a 1hr45min buff of food 
and drink a couple of times in quick succesion trying to get to a hard 
corpse and you are running low in the backpack.

But then of course death should not be forgiving ))
