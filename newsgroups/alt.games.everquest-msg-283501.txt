For me game in being patched is not too big problem.
I am looking in here sometimes and seeing many many grammatical mistakes. So 
I imagine the amount of written code for EQ is in the Billions. Mistakes are 
inevatable.

Sometimes, during a 72 man raid I slack at the back and just admire the 
whole thing.

I actually boggle at how anybody actually started to "write" such a complex 
programme. Pen and pencil to start???

When you think about all the aspects of the game, and heres just a simple 
example.


A man on Australia pulls a MOB in game, that a shaman buffed tank in America 
engages and sends a voice tell to his raid, who have been hasted by a chanty 
in England, who handed out KEI to a cleric from Norway, who group healed his 
whole raid force with MGB.

Forget all the countless add-ons, procs, effects, buffs dots armor graphics, 
weapons. food drink stats particles mounts, etc etc etc.

And a slack druid, sat at the back watched it all on his screen, while havin 
CyborZ with a chick from the USA....

Sheeesh i think its absolutley amazing.
