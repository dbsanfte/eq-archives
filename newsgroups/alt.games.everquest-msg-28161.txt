I wanted to do some repartitioning on my second computer.  So, I dug
around in my CDs, and found my old copy of Partition Magic 4.0.  I
tried it install it...and it asked for my serial number.  I haven't
used PM 4.0 in over 2 years, and have no idea where my serial number
went.  For some reason (which I don't recall), I don't have the disk
in the original jewel case.

I *do* have the original box, with the manual and the registration
card.  Examining the box and the contents...no sign of my serial
number.

So I turn to the net.  I type "partition magic 4 serial number" at
Google, and a couple minutes later, I've got a serial number.  Would
have been faster, but the first three places I found with Partition
Magic serial numbers only had 3.0 and 5.0.

The funny thing is, I don't see anything in the EULA that prohibits
this.  It doesn't say I have to use the serial number that came with
the copy *I* bought.

If it weren't for the net, I'd be pretty pissed off at PowerQuest
right now, because I'd have to be wait for their tech support to open,
and then try to get a serial number out of them.  (I get email ads
from them whenever a new version or upgrade comes out, so I'm pretty
sure I registered some version of PM once).  These serial number
schemes don't stop pirates.  They mostly just annoy people who have a
legitimate copy and lost the freaking serial number.  However, given
the ridiculous ease at which I found serial numbers on the net, I'm
more amused than pissed.

It's hard to recall how we got along with our software before the
Internet.
