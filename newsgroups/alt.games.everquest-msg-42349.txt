Well, I'm just baffled by all of this. Yeah, it was free and now it's
not. It's a whole US$3.33 per month - in my market, that's not enough
to buy one Big Mac value meal at McDonalds. If you don't value the
paid content at Allakhazam enough to pay for it, hey, don't pay for it
- if you just can't afford another three bucks a month, you probably
can't actually *afford* to play online games with a monthly fee at
all.

Heck, just removing the (horrible, slow, page-breaking) banner ads was
worth $3.33 to me.
