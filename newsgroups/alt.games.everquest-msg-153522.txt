Leaping to my own defense...  I was quoting Sanjian's (second)
misspelling (hooray cut and paste!  :-p ) which you can see quite
clearly three lines above in the text you quoted.  And it was the
"gae" ending that led to my remark about a marine microbe.

Kaev <--- who's really, really, incredibly positive there's got to
be an error this time
