Higher end, bard/wiz combo is pretty decent.  Just gotta let the bard get
agro with DoT's, but I've DoT kited with a wiz well enough up to Fire.
Benefit is that with the wiz you just need to cast every now and then to
take a chunk of HP off at a time while the bard is happily running about.
Not hard to alt-tab across sessions and hit a hotkey to target and nuke a
mob then alt-tab back to the bard...

Shammy/Cleric is a surprisingly good combo too.  Hell, shammy/any class.
