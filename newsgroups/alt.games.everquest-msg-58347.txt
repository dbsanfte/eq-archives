Of course meditating.

Well, not really.  Backing up.  Starting to meditate.  Getting up,
reaplying
root, backing up... hey, guess what I'm mostly doing?  Backing up!

If root would stick for more than an average of ten seconds, then
I'd get the "less downtime between fights" effect.

BUT if you add up the time from beginning of fight to end of fight and
then
med to FM, I think at my level that you'll get very similar "cycle" times.

I prefer a short fight and a long med after, rather than a long fight and
a short med after... but add short and long or long and short and so
far you get very similar sums.
