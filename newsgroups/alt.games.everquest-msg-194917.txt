Another moron.  This one quotes 2 morons, in total, just to say, err, ask,
uhh, I have no clue what he is trying to do.  Does he want to know if page
223 of his Bible says the same thing (hint, open it up and read it)?  Or,
does he want to tell us "Not in my Bible", in which case it should not be a
question.

Ok, Mr. Duzer, it is time for you to get a clue.  If you have access to the
internet and decide that now is the time to try to say something pithy, you
really need to learn how.
