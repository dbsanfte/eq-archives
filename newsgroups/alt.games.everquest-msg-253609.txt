Berserkers are sheer DPS.  That's about the only reason to have one around.
They seem to be a purely PoP/GoD zone worthy class, as their lack of any
other skills makes them pretty pointless.  They can off-tank as well as a
ranger or monk, but can't pull.  And they don't have the CR ability of a
rogue, or the TL ability of a wizard.

Would probably explain why I've only seen two on the Drinal server PLed up
to 65.  Can't figure out what their role is supposed to be.
