Only two things wrong with LOIO's Sarnak Fortress.......  TRAINS!!!  and it
can be difficult to get in and out of zone to sell etc. without getting
eaten alive by spiders.

> A nice zone to hunt is also the old Lake of Ill Omen zone on Kunark.
> Easy to reach with the PoP expansion and not so overcrowded as Paludal
> usually is. Exp isn't as good as Paludal but as enchanter you should be
> able to catch a nice hunting group at the sarnak fortress there.
> Done this with my beastlord at level 24 because Paludal was too full for
> me.
