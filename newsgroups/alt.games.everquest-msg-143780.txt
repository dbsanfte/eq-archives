The more sophisticated those cards become, the more we will rely on them.
The more we rely on them, the more damage will be done when the controls are
circumvented.  Remember, if something can be made, it can also be
counterfeited.

Identity theft is only an issue because we have a system where identity is
important.  If there were no credit agencies, no social security numbers,
etc, then identity theft would be meaningless.  Granted, I'm not saying that
such a system would be better.
