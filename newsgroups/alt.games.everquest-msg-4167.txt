Refresh my memory - what was that question again?

You didn't make my killfile upon your first post, in any event. Only
after I got the strong impression that your only intent in this group
was to chat with your friends from FAng, and that you had no interest
in Everquest.

I'm not unwilling to admit that my impression was incorrect, but I'm
still undecided.

No. I imagine a review of your first four days of posts would explain
it quite clearly, at least to me, though you might view that material
differently.

Ummm, right. Ok. Whatever you say.

To call us bigots because we dislike certain individuals based upon
their actions demonstrates that you have a tendency towards using
loaded words at the drop of a hat.

And as for the label "trouble maker", do you have some other way to
describe what Avenger and Getsumj were doing in this group? Or may
still be doing - I don't know, they've long since been in my kill
file.

>Oxymoronic, isn't it?

I doubt it very much.

>>>The same goes to all you insensitive pricks out there.

>> Quaking, etc.

>Does this mean you're an insensitive prick?

It means I expect you to categorize me that way. And that I don't
care.

If my choice is to be lumped with the trouble makers like the above
mentioned two, or with the people who dislike them, then I know which
group I want to be part of, and I don't give a rat's ass what you call
them.
