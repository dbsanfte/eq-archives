Game Update: The next Game Update is expected to be on Wednesday,

GMT). The estimated downtime is 6 hours.


1/16/2008


Here�s a sneak peek at Wednesday�s Game Update Notes. These notes may or 
may not be changed before the update is completed:

*** Highlights ***

- The beta reward item for players who participated in the Secrets of 
Faydwer beta test is now available.  Anyone who turned in at least 50 
beta tokens (or a single raid token) can speak to Old Man Thorren in 
Plane of Knowledge on the beta server and request your reward.  This 
will then allow you to use the /claim system to claim the reward item, 
the Golden Mask of the Goblin King, on the character and server of your 
choice.


*** Items ***

- Made some slight changes to the rare group items in SoF.
- Changed the recast group on items with Geomantra to avoid interference 
with items that have no recast timer.
- Added a required level to the Bulwark of Many Portals.
- Added Augment Sockets to Elegant Crystalskin Sleeves.
- Changed the name of the Moray Eel from the Buried Sea to Barren Moray Eel.
- Cultural augments (seals and symbols) will now only fit in armor.
- Elegant Charms have had an additional upgrade in their stats.
- Many potions that had a different required level than the required 
level for the spell have been changed to have the item required level 
match the spell required level. This will not change the functioning of 
the potion in any way, it will just reduce confusion as to the intended 
level for the potion.
- Spider Food Poison and Worg Food Poison are no longer temporary.
- Raid loot drop tables have been increased.


*** Quests & Events ***

- The final two steps of the "Repairing the Spiritlight Earring" quest 
have been changed so that they can be completed in any zone.

Earring but has not, hand it to Acolyte Emyria in Bloodmoon Keep and she 
will replace it.
- Selay will no longer be fooled into leaving Lethar.
- The Griffon Master event in Ashengate has been made a bit less difficult.
- Fixed a bug with the Dyn'leth raid that allowed players to avoid one 
of the mechanics.  Also gave the poor fellow a few more hit points.
- It is no longer possible to levitate near Veldyn.
- Fixed an issue that was causing the Operations Manager to spawn 
multiple times.
- Reduced the lockout timers on all Mansion and Crystallos raids to four 
and a half days.  This will not affect existing timers, only newly 
acquired timers.

to the short-duration buff window.

"Dispel".

been split off to a separate buff.  The caster can drop the illusion and
