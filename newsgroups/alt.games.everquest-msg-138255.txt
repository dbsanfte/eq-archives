Get a large force, guess at least 3 groups, maybe more. Seen 36 50+ 
people being wiped out by him.

Since its in Kith, there are a few things to consider. First of all, 
only pull in daytime. The mobs might be greens to most of the force, but 
having 3 HTing undeads charge your unprotected casters can be fatal.
The DEs are a great place to use harmony. Harmony the camp, and single 
pull the DEs, untill only quest NPC are left, then get rogue to spawn 
General, and single pull him. KEEP aggro on the main tank, the general 
are kinda nasty, had a few deaths last time we did him, due to 
overnuking or healing.
Do NOT let any stupid halfling newbies watch, a level 9 halfling managed 
to get half our force wiped first time we killed General, due to us 
moving to our pull spot while he managed to get aggro on himself, and 
before he went down he managed to pull the DEs in aggro range of us. And 
the full DE hut are NASTY when you got 30+ unbuffed players not in any 
way ready for it.

And last, but not least, all on raid go role or anon. Nothing wrong with 
helping other rogues get their epics too, but in the 30 min we spend 
gathering we had 1 rogue come and ask for help (helped him after we got 
our own 4 general kills), and around 12 more sending tells for help to 
kill General. Aviod getting uber spammed with requests.
