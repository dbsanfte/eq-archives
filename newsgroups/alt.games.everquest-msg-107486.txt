Are you still trying to do this part? Because if you are, you are
doing something wrong. That camp shouldn't go longer than two hours at
the very max, there's only two spawns you need to keep killing and I
don't recall anything seriously hostile there, nothing that couldn't
be handled.

Up on EJ's upper ledge area, as far to the left as you can go (left
facing the jungle, not the wall). You may need to clear all the
monkeys you get on track from there. After you do that, if you know
your druid tracking, you will see rillas spawning (they'll be at the
top of the track list unless by some ungodly rare coincidence someone
else is killing things in that area, which is at the opposite side of
the zone from the two evac spots and TT). Only two rilla spawns are
nearby. One of them will bring up your live tainted. Once you've
gotten to the point you're killing the two that spawn around there as
they pop, you should never need to go off the ledge IIRC, and they
should give you your tainted in one sitting.

I did that part of the epic quite a long time ago but I don't think I
am forgetting anything, but I suppose there could be something new.
