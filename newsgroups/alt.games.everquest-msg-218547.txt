   I remember reading somewhere recently (maybe even here, possibly)
that the reason the troll warders are gecko sized is because contrary to
what we've heard for all these years, it isn't the width that matters,
it's the length.  The big 'gators trolls had following them were in fact
too long, which resulted in even more piss poor pathing than usual. 
Hence they were perma shrunk.  And there are no plans on changing that,
according it the article I read.

   Please don't ask for the cite, since I tend to be very bad googling
this sort of thing, and there is NO chance of me remembering where I
read it and retracing my steps.
