Are there any sites or forums that i could look at to kit my ranger out a
bit better? Just seeing what gear looks like before i buy it would be a
bonus.

Mainly a head item that doesnt look like a swimming cap would be good, im
using rygor because it has no graphic.

Any help always welcome, thanks in advance
