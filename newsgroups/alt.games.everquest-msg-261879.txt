  It's a different game these days. The old grinage spots - PoV, HoH, BoT -
are virtually deserted. Lower level groupage spots are empty, too, as the
players
who would be bringing up alts there have dusted off high-level former mains
they
haven't played in years to do what they haven't done since a few months
after PoP
was released: ding. Even the Bazaar is light on traders.
  This makes it hard for me to work on my alts, other than soloing. And
there is less
KEI to be had, as chanters go looking for C6. But I have a guild now, and
can
group with anybody else.
  I have only tried two grind groups so far: one in Noble's Causeway, with
BoT-like
mobs and experience; and one in Wall of Slaughter, described by someone in
guildchat
as "the new Karnor's". 71 people in zone at once. There are fears the mobs
will be
nerfed, so people are stocking up on drops. If drop rates on
tradeable/attuneable
gear are nerfed, prices will skyrocket.
  Last night my mostly-guild group did East Caves in WoS; a tunnel leading
to a loop,
with nothing but level 65 mukgliders. An ideal grindage setup, you could
crawl around
the tunnel loop all day, just make sure to keep ahead of the repops. AAxp
was 3 blue
ticks per mob, at BoT rates. No wonder the place is so crowded.
  After a while of this we decided to try something different, and headed
back out into
the open. There were groups all along the south edge of the zone, pulling
from the ruins.
We tried taking up a space there, did one dragorn, lower level than the
murkgliders
and less xp. Second pull ended up being 3, and I had to evac us. Got back to
the camp,
and another group between us and the zoneout tunnel pulled a named,
Shadowhunter,
red con, big nasty looking beast, and I ended up getting hit with a gflux
from extreme
range - took off 39% of my hp. Some people reported getting hit for up to
2000
damage by it. At this point I tried to run around it and back to the
zoneout, but of
course it wiped the group that had pulled it faster than that and was on its
way back
home when I crossed its path...
  Well, there was a cleric at ZI just for such wipes, so I kept most of the
xp I had earned.
The guild is rapidly piling up Muramite Runes of various types. Other loot,
some of
it jaw-dropping, is flowing in. Who will ever want to do Vex Thal or BoT
again?
