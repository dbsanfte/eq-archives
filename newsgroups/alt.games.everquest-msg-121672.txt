In reality its often amusing how little of a user agreement or license
will stand up in court beyond the theft of the property. In particular
the ones that say such silly things as this one does. "For any reason"
surely does not extend to "You cant play because you are black and we
don't like blacks" does it now? But what the heck its a game and so is
this discussion. 8-)

Now what other BS can I get into while waiting to be exploited by sony
hehe I know! Download showeq!!!!
