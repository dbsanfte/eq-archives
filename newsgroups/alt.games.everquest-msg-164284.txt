No, because it's not limited to that.

With every single level your Dual Wield percent *rises*, your Double
Attack percent *rises*, your Riposte percent *rises*, your Dodge percent
*rises*, your Parry percent *rises*.  The odd caster spell might have a
level based increase but that's not the norm and it certainly doesn't
make up for the cumualtive effect of all the benefits melï¿½e are
receiving.

Tell me you didn't fucking mean this, dumbfuck.

Your MEDIDATION skill governs how much mana you get per tick and guess
what, bub, that's only changed 10 points since Level 47.  You still only
get 25pts of mana per tick sitting.  If your mana pool has rised, in
percentage terms, going from 0% to 100% takes *longer*.  Of course in
absolute terms its basically identical.  To go from 0 to 3000 mana takes
the exact same time.
