Seriously? Stop playing for awhile. Don't cancel the account or
anything extreme, just take a break for a couple of weeks, a month,
whatever.

If after all that time you come back and still don't enjoy it, then
give some thought to canceling.

It is, after all, just a game, and it's no surprise that even a game
as detailed and large as EQ eventually loses it's appeal. I'm
struggling with it myself lately, and have scaled back my playing a
great deal.
