  Thanks for confirming this.

  This is what I thought I remembered, though I heard differently from
a couple (not very reliable) sources recently.  Just wanted to clear
that up.

  Is this the way it has always been, or was it changed around the
time the "offset bonus" was implemented?  I ask because I remember
that one "EQ revealed" web site that detailed the workings of the
experience penalties, and it suggested that level was NOT the
determinant on how experience was rewarded, but that rather level was.

  It also said, however, that there is no "grouping bonus" so the
information cannot have been entirely accurate.  Still, on virtually
every point it seemed correct and well researched.
