That depends.  The two places I go are Upper Guk and East Karanas.

Upper Guk has lower-level mobs, and there's less likely to be any
competition from other players.  There are only about fifteen or
so spiders, and they're on timed spawns.  But that can be a good
thing if you're also doing housework or something.  Kill all the
spiders, loot up, then wash dishes or do laundry while you're waiting
for the next spawns.  And if you have good froglok faction, I think
Upper Guk is safe, so you can go AFK without worrying.

East Karanas is better for sheer number of drops, but there's more
likely to be competition from other players there doing the same
thing.  And it's a somewhat more dangerous zone, especially for
lower level characters.
