This is from a pre-nerf perspective but up to 50th lvl I found my monk
to be terribly cheap to equip. At levels 40-50, he had maybe 3k worth
of equipment and always had better AC than any other melee I ran
across. This was in the early Velious era...

One other thing about FD is that it lets you solo deep in dungeons
where nobody w/o FD would even consider soloing.

These days I'd actually consider the warrior the best soloer of the
pure melee classes (at least through 50th lvl).  You can buy a cheap
regen breastplate for around 5k which helps a lot. Good weapons that
people would have considered high end during the luclin era are
incredibly cheap so your DPS might actually be better than a monk
(monk weapons tend to be more expensive since the selection is
smaller). Combine that with nice cheap hitpoint equipment which you
can take off before bandaging to bind for over 50% and you can solo up
through 50th lvl w/o any downtime other than bandaging up to half. 

Strangely enough, I always found my warrior to be least likely to die
while soloing. He's best equiped to handle a linkdeath while soloing,
is the only class that runs just as fast at 20% health as at full
health and with his hitpoint buffer you tend not to get the damage
spikes a monk gets. About halfway through a fight you'll know with a
warrior whether you're gonna win or not, with my monk I'd push the
envelope if and often die to a lucky string of hits when the mob was
at 5% health and I was too stubborn to feign early. 

Monk soloing is a lot more fun than a warrior but if you know how to
strafe-run and are reasonably secure in your target selection, a
soloing warrior is almost indestructable IME.
