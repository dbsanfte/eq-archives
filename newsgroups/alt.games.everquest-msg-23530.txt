Why should I guess that someone posting from Microsoft would not be at
least conversant in english??

Feel free to post in english and your Primary language,  this is an
international group.  Someone will be happy to Assist those of us aren't
conversant in your primary language.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
