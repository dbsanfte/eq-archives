Anyone out there besides me having problems in Rivervale?  Ever since the new
Luclin world was added, Rivervale has been problematic.  The display is jerky
and the sound sputters and hiccups.  My poor little dwarven cleric had to leave
RV yesterday because it was so bad.  I wonder if Sony and Verant know about the
Rivervale problem.  I'm finding it quite troubling.
