Spawns once per EQ "day" (90 minutes, I think)

Trigger spawns once per EQ "day"... but Ixiblat spawns a ways off, you can root
the trigger, your friend pulls Ixi away, you atone the trigger, and he stays up,
so you can spawn again immediately after killing Ixi the first time.  I did hear
a rumor this stopped working, if so, well its still only 90 minutes at most till
the next "day"...

Spawn is either once an hour or once a half hour, I forget which.  At any rate,
he's very near the Queen, who is needed for warrior epic, and she spawns either
once an hour or once a half hour, the opposite of the king.  There are enough
mobs guarding the two of them to make this a good camp for a mid 50s raid party,
going back and forth from one room to the other, and both have some nice drops
for guilds in that power bracket, so its worth staying for hours even after all
your clerics and all your warriors have their drops.  Plus, its FUN!

Triggered spawn, the warder spawns in about 20 minutes, so if you have multiple
clerics who are completely ready, you can go go go.

Bottleneck mob is Zordak Ragefire in Sol B, you have to get past the fire giants
to hand in to him, and he despawns when you do and isnt' back for 24 real life
hours.  Fortunately getting past fire giants is a one group exp and loot camp
for most people who dont have the epic yet... although I do have a friend who
just now started epic at 63
