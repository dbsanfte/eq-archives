I would recommend BlackICE Defender
(http://www.networkice.com/products/blackice_defender.html).  I've tried
ZoneAlarm, but it always seemed very annoying to me.  I had to shut it down
for anything involving UDP ports (ie, anything but email and browsing).
BlackICE is about $40, but it's money VERY well spent.

Incidentally, it's not the speed of DSL that increases the security risk,
it's the fact that it's always on.  You're at much more risk of being hacked
when you're connected 24/7 than if you're only connected when you dial up.
But a good firewall completely eliminates that risk.
