I got an Optical Logitech Wireless mouse and it's been one of the best
things I've had in a while!!  It's great for left or right handed folks and
no damn cord or mousepad to get in the way!

Downside is it needs a few AA batteries once in a while (3months?) but power
use is so low I can often cycle other batteries from stuff in place of brand
new ones (digital camera, remote controls, etc.)
