This was why I told you the Alum in the Wine story; something non 
toxic... better than non toxic, technically "food"... but extremely 
unpleasant, put into something going into someone's mouth.  It worked, 
and there was no risk of permanently harming anyone.

For the wine, Alum worked pretty well, since its soluable; I'm not sure 
a hot sauce would really work all that well as I suspect the heat is 
mostly oil based, and would float up to the top.

Your food situation is different, and hot sauce is probably a more 
reasonable solution... although ordering an expensive bottle via mail 
means more money and time.

Best part of this solution, though, is that you now have two different 
people telling you it worked for them in the past, both punishing the 
thief and putting a halt to the thieving.
