 Killing Orcs and doing the goblin ears in HHP I think should get you in
good with both cities. I'm not sure since I never really cared about
WFP/EFP faction. Nothing in those two zones I care about. You can
probably find all that on Alakhazams somewhere.

 If you ever decide to do the auction thing, NFP banking is more than
useful since on most servers the trade zones are either NFP or the
tunnel in EC. If you're a monk you can buy (with sneak) Fuzzlecutters
5000 outside of the WFP gate from the gnome. A little expensive but it's
considering an Enduring drink and lasts rather long. As for food, I'm
not sure what's around. I normally whip up a stack of fishrolls when I'm
in the WC/EC area.

 Iksar are KOS at the outpost. You can bank there if you're real careful
and don't do it during the day. At night all the dragoons usually head
out of the outpost and harass people. However, during most of the day,
General D'Veers is usually standing in the bank. He hits hard and has a
Harm Touch that does about 1000 in damage. The only way to gain outpost
faction (VenrilSathir) is to kill Kunark Dragons (and Esorpa of the Ring
in WW) or the warbraid quest. Which is hard to do if you're already kos.
Also, you give up hunting in three zones (Kaesora, Karnors, Charasis),
one of which you sorta need to hunt in if you're a monk and want to do
your epic (Karnors).
