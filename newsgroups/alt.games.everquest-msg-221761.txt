This is essentially what I use.

I'm also going to guess that your problem shifting hotbanks is the same one
I have.    It only started once I got my new computer.    The problem is
with Number Lock.   If that is turned on, windows will override your "Shift
plus number pad 7" and instead just give you "Number pad 7".    Make sure
Num Lock is always turned off, and it goes away.

I'm not sure what causes it.    Might be a windows XP thing, or this
particular kind of keyboard, as with my old computer / keyboard, it didn't
matter whether num lock was on or off, it never ignored shift.  I dobut it's
EQ's fault, as it doesn't seem likely to be something they would screw up in
a patch, and it was working fine before.

In any event, I set up those keys when I was first in from Halflife / Quake
/ etc.    It was just easier for me to keep the same keys I had been using.
WASD controls my movement with my left hand.   My right hand shifts between
the hotkey bank on my number pad, and my mouse.   I use the mouselook
function a great deal.
