I was playing the PS2 Champions of Norrath- this is the hack and slash
game.

The hot looking elf is in the game and calls herself Fiona Vie.  I was
wondering if her name in the PC everquest game is the same.  I
partially bought the game because she was in the adds and on the box -
I'm a dork if you couldn't tell- and I was intrigued by this.

any info anyone has on her name and what the story is behind the Fiona
Vie character- I would appreciate your help

Armin
