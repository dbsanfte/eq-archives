Portee's rules:

1) Always offer something or say I am broke is that okay? Many Druids
have no need for donations, and some do.

2) Please and Thank you regardless if they say no. Sometime in the
future they may say yes. Don't tell them to kiss my butt, and don't
use dood spk. I hate seeing "can u TP me 2 WC 4 10pp?" How much more
effort is it to type "Can you please TP me to WC? I can offer you
10pp"

3) Camo and SoW are not automatic, when in doubt ask. WC and Surefall
are always Camo zones IMHO.

4) If you can get a TL from a Wizard, they will often cast that
freely. Most anywhere a druid ports, a Wizard will TL pretty close.
