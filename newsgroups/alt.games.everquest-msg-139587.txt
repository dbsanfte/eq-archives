30 items. No more, no less.

30 items is the hardcoded limit for vendors. Since the bazaar uses
existing Vendor code, VI have specifically stated there are no immediate
plans to change the number of items a PC can have for sale. So don't be
too surprised hehe.

Only way I could think of getting round it is to have 3 different vendor
bags, all 10-slot and lore. But given the trouble some people seem to
have even finding the one type o bags, three types may be a step beyond
the pale...
