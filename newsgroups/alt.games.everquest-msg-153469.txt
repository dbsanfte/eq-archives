Of all the EQ stories I've heard - "Burned Woods", Skater Gnome's
adventures, the VP raid - "wwwaaaddd" is the one I found the funniest.  I
don't know if it's true, but it sounds true enough to have made me laugh and
laugh the first time I read it, to the point of nearly being in tears over
it.  =)

I've told other EQ friends about it and they all have looked at me blankly,
so it must be a personal thing.  =)

I often amused my guild with wry observations about my own failings.  Once I
offered the following "Quiz", back in my mid-30's:

/gu You zone into Great Divide, and you see a Frost Giant running towards
you at warp speed.  Do you:
/gu A)  Root, nuke, and fight?
/gu B) Turn and zone back out?
/gu C) Stand there watching slack-jawed until he begins beating you to a
bloody pulp, by which time it's far too late to choose either of the other
options?
/gu If you chose C), you name is Monual.

One of my guildmates later mentioned that he'd been so captivated by the
Quiz that he'd fallen down the hole in Crystal Caverns and nearly killed
himself.  :)

Just two days ago I was with my new guild in Ssra, and we were camping
insignia drops for Emp keys.  This involved about forty of us beating up on
mobs with insane numbers of hitpoints.  Since my group was at full health
after I'd cast a few touch-up heals, I did my usual technique of targeting
the mob, then using /assist to see who they were targeting so I could add
some backup healing, if needed.  That led to the following observation I
made in the raid channel:

"When you /assist the mob to see who needs healing and you end up targeting
yourself, you know you're about to get hurt *real* *bad*."

Indeed, I had lost about a third of my hitpoints before the MT took aggro
back.  This observation got some mild chuckles from the raid.

It's those stories - real events that perhaps don't have a powerful punch
line but show us laughing at ourselves - that I most enjoy reading and
telling.
