I still have all of my Amiga computers, one A1000, three A500s, and
one A3000. All need repairs to work, except the A1000. All of them
bought years ago.

As for why they went out of business. We heard, in 1989, that the
major stock holder got the CBM board of directors to hire his buddy
as CEO. They paid the guy about half of CBM's annual gross monies,
and bought him a jet to fly around in. They went into debt for
millions of dollars.

And it looks like the AmigaOS has been sold again:
