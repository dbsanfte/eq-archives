That reminds me, my nearing 70 elderly mother claims that when she was
young light bulbs lasted forever practically. The problem of course is
that eventually the light bulb company realizes its not going to be
making money if it keeps doing that. Then later its ripe for a company
like Philips to come on with an advertisement for a light bulb that
lasts a long time acting like its something new (and of course
charging more)

The expense of tradeskill items is time, not price. They can be made
cheaply but in EQ all except jewelry have an insane time component due
to the rarity of the supplies. The problem is they eventually suck
compared to dropping items in the game which are actually easier to
get.

Yep, a post by brad McQuaid or someone to the EQ forum stated that
over 50 percent, or a majority, of the accounts playing EQ have at
least one level 50 character. Such people don't want banded armor.

Pretty much, at level 11 on the new firiona vie server my barb shaman
had like 65 plat and a good start in gear and money from the warrens
and such. It then started to skill up in smithing to make itself
banded. This is really not hard, you simply add in like 3 points,
screw sharpening stuff for pennies since its not worth it, make metal
bits to trivial, use those metal bits to make toolboxes to trivial,
then you could make some skewers to gain some skill or basically start
making yourself banded with the easiest pieces first. I was at like
skill 29 when I found out a guy was already selling banded in freeport
for 1 plat per ac so I went there and bought a full set instead. Maybe
later I will skill up more on banded but its not really worth it. 

I checked and a new server might be the only place where northman
ringmail, especially if imbued, would be sellable but guess what
verant did? Both the imbued and non imbued kind need essence of winter
which ONLY drops from frost giants in Everfrost (would need group of
45's or so plus) or tundra yetis in dreadlands (probably group of 35
plus? don't remember their con) Do you see the problem? I'm level 12
now and by the time I'm 35 even people will be 60 (probably some are
already 35 plus there now) and selling rygorr, the giant vest thing
off either of the two giants outside kael (like the rygorr bp but
easier to get, sells for less, since large races only) tizmak, ulthork
and whatever all which is basically better for my barb shaman than
northman imbued even. 

There is really only a couple armor making items that are worth it on
a new server. Its pretty much the non imbued iksar stuff (requires no
temper.. unlike the northman stuff which still does) and can be began
when maxxed at banded (with all the supplies in one of the cabillis
zones) and ogre since its temper is one of the easiest needing only
bloods off very low things (elf and dwarf comes from cb, butcher off
bandits, the not so very high rangers in timorous, etc while human
comes off bandits and the like) Adamantite unimbued/enchanted plate
and chain would also be good for dark elves to make once they can kill
shadowmen for the essences and is probably the next most doable
cultural type.

DAOC sounds like a totally different game to me than EQ. The reason
why a decay and replace economy works in DAOC is because its more
character dependent than item dependent as far as your characters raw
power. In EQ a 60th level warrior is not a good tank but a 60th level
warrior in all skyshrine or kael quest armor, a great rare haste cloak
from a dragon, great rare weapons etc, is a good tank. Meanwhile items
in DAOC seem a lot more mundane and you'd be upgrading slightly
usually before you replaced them anyway. The two are completely
opposite in that regard. In DAOC a suit of normal chain armor is
fantastic and VERY expensive while in EQ banded is crud and cheap as
heck.

EQ is set up with the good stuff so rare that it can't rot. Normal
chain in daoc is great but its also a normal item so rotting is okay.
Think of it this way, if in EQ fine steel plate and banded mail were
basically the best armors in the game and your character's power
depended more on its skills and level and if race really made a
difference and if creatures were scaled down and there were no god
like encounters, then yeah it would be fine for items to rot. However
its not that way. Instead stuff is incredibly rare and you outfit ONE
person with a good item with tons of blood, sweat and tears and 40
people wasting an entire evening. THAT ITEM CAN'T ROT. The two are as
different as night and day. 

Its taking my wood elf druid forever just to get 2 pieces of skyshrine
quest armor in my guild since we are having terrible luck with the bp
and legs. Its also taken me forever to save up the money to buy black
marbles for the BP when I get it since I don't have the time to go
camp them. Basically if any of this stuff rotted I'd just quit. It is
far too non mundane and time consuming to get it for that to happen.
EQ would have to be totally rebuilt.

And the fact that it takes 40 people an evening to get a couple level
60 items while it takes 1 or two people a short time to get a level 10
item. EQ is not consistent that way. I've heard daoc is much more
consistent.

Verant building their game the way they do and making blacksmithing
produce products which are ASS is what prevents you from being a
successful blacksmith. I started a dark elf smith but quickly realized
that the time component in getting required temper drops is just too
damn high when really the only kind I see worth making is enchanted
imbued which would require a ton more skill meaning I'd have to make
fine steel first which is basically throwing money away and hard as
hell to do effectively  for an evil having to run from the mountain
rathe vendors to ogguk at best, or waste the tempers making regular
adamantite which is also basically throwing money away to get the
skill to have a snowballs chance in hell to make the harder kind which
might sell (since its basically better than a dark elf Sks FEAR plane
umbral armor as far as AC is concerned (umbral only has a few more
resses, and is darn good for clerics too)

Well really it is a problem, but not because things don't rot but
rather because smithing sucks ass. There is still really only one
viable tradeskill, jewelry. I don't know why that is but verant only
seems to want jewelry to be the only one (or they are just very
stupid/naive/ignorant, etc) I mean you see level 60's in 6 ac 65 hp
rings which are EASIER to make than effectively making fine steel
plate yet you DON'T see any 60's in fine steel plate. A jeweler can
just go and BUY the stuff for some of its best items at a VENDOR
(except for the blue diamond or diamond stuff) No other tradeskill is
like that. 

I honestly think on the high end a smith or tailor should be able to
make items which rival the best ones for a tank or druid just like the
best jewelry which can still have the materials bought off a vendor
rival rings that fall off of all but the most uber dragons or other
mobs/quests in the game.

Its apples and oranges. Once again he is talking about changing the
entire game of EQ. You can't just take EQ the way it is now and make
things rot. As I said above they are too rare and uber to rot, its NOT
the same as items in DAOC at all and banded rotting would be totally
moot.

TLC is also not the way to stop it since usually things DO give you Xp
at an appropriate level you'd really want them. The mobs rygorr or the
giant tunic drops off of are still blue to my level 55 druid, same
with crustacean plate, etc and everything on up.

Players are against TLC because EQ is not random loot and the players
know that. You can't kill an appropriate level mob and get something
great since it might only drop from this ghoul guy in lower guk (the
fbss) Something else you seem to be missing is that they are against
it for LUCLIN because Luclin will be all new and they did not have a
CHANCE to get stuff from there at level 30 which might be great stuff
they'd still use. Although Absor or someone suggested they have twinks
of varying levels to experience content and drops in Luclin, where
originally they wanted to have TLC for ALL items and ALL quests,  many
players don't want to play more than one character and want to explore
it with their main and not have their main get cut off from content.

That really does not happen for the one thing we see knocked here a
lot, twinking. I just paid like 4800 plat for 2 black marbles and need
like 1 k for another. Then perhaps soon my druid will get the drop
needed for her velious quest BP. The thing is, there are a ton of
priest characters without velious quest bps.. since even being ABLE to
do kael and especiially TOV is pretty high end still on my server.
Basically those gems will STILL be in demand and STILL go for a few k
plat until EQ is dead. For one thing once my druid has all her SS
armor.. I have a level 37 cleric  and I'm really one of the slackers
in my guild so by the time I'm done with my set drops will probably be
opening to twinks.. especially from kael for the thurg quest armors.
Guess what that means? Yep, several thousand more k for gems for that
character. Then of course I'll want a kitty shamaness in Luclin who
will also eventually need gems. I am not the odd person out in this
regard either, most people do this so these gems will ALWAYS be in
high demand, for the life of the game.

I spent 30 minutes getting one twink jboots (fourth spawn, and only
because no one was around and the "a cyclops" is great xp at 51 and
52) and 45 seconds getting another twink them (logged out at the spawn
.. got on when server was up.. ac on track ;)  ) I'm pretty sure
multiquesting Jboots is still very valuable though. It CAN take a lot
of time or it CAN take a few seconds. Mostly I find it takes a few
seconds when I happen by, or a lot of time when I'm really trying.

Yep, my druid was falling behind really on raids then it made resist
diamond and blue diamond stuff job one for a while. Then I had
fantastic resists and wis and went to getting my tov armor full time
and I'm only level 55. The uber encounters my guild does requires I
have that kind of equipment.

No one can make money in EQ with tradeskills on the LOW end because
they suck. Guess what else I found out? Tradeskill people on FV server
are not even making money from my shaman when low level because I'm
not a newb and I know that plus 2 wis earrings and rings are really
not going to help my character at all so paying 2 - 4 plat for them is
throwing money away. They try to sell to me and I say "tell me when
you can make the 3 ac earrings or at least 4 ac 45 hp rings"

Stuff that sucks ALWAYS sucks. I only bought banded because I know it
will be a while before better stuff is in the economy AND before I can
afford it and in that case replacing my patchwork with leather would
have been throwing money away. Lucky for me enough bozos will shell
out 2 plat for rings and earrings which don't really help their
chracter at all to get jewelers to the point where they are making the
stuff that does for me.

Yep, just as I said above. People are already finding this out in
DAOC.. they constantly replace gear to a point long before it would be
rotting so rot is not even an issue.

Well, actually I read that tradeskills in DAOC ARE viable because you
can produce comparable armor FAR cheaper than what it would cost from
a vendor or even another player selling stuff.

That is probably true with DAOC, again it is totally different from EQ
and really a better way of doing things.

Yep, that is another great thing in DAOC I guess. I've not bought it
yet but plan to try if I continue to mainly hear positive things. No
on the second part of your question though. I'm pretty sure that the
SMITH can MAKE the more uber stuff but could not use it themselves
basically and would sell it.

Yep, its a bit like the guy on FV who was lower level than my 12
shaman already selling banded at 1 plat per ac. What he does is make
me say, "i won't bother then" because 1 plat per ac is not really
worth it. I can generally make more adventuring. Now, for the DRUID
who can make fine steel its worth it to max banded anyway and be
making fine steel first since fine steel WILL have value on FV for
some time. I say druid because only a druid can bind by a forge then
teleport to steamfont and buy the fine plate supplies then gate back,
making it far easier to make the stuff. A wizard can do it nearly as
easily with a short run. Other classes or races will have a hard
time.. I think even for the gnomes they have to buy the supplies to
smith in kaladim and that would only be for small plate. See my druid
did this already on an established server so I know ;) It could bind
at halas for large, freeport for medium, or kaladim for small, then
teleport to steamfont to buy the other stuff it needs and gate back. 

The one reason why I did not make a druid though on FV was that I've
done the tradeskill thing and its just not worth it really.

I've seen this on FV also.. there is no "auction" zone so its VERY
hard to both sell and buy things since its kind of a matter of luck.
There is CONSTANT spam auctioning in GFAY but its all in Elf. 
The language thing puzzles me too.. my barb shaman started with master
of common(human tongue) and barb (useless) then learned at least 2
points in dwarf, gnome and elf. however at level 10 I got a point in
dark elf and halfling and ONLY dark elf and halfling turns up at my
trainer so they are the only ones I can progress in (since otherwise
you can get one point per HOUR max (real time hour) )

Luclin will fix that with a prearranged auction zone everyone can get
to at most 3 zones away every 45 minutes (you will be picked up
automatically from any wizard spires thingie evidently by clicking yes
to a box.. every 45 minutes) and FV is the first and possibly only
server where that would be darn useful since the zone will be complete
with banks and the ability to list items people can call up then
evidently. Of course on regular servers people STILL might mainly use
EC since waiting up to 45 minutes at a ring (and yes, its REAL TIME 45
minutes) might not seem worth it. The one thing which could make
people like it is if it was a uniform 45 minutes.. like every day
playing EQ you knew 3 pm your time was a pick up time.

Exactly. The server I play on, Tribunal, is like 7 months newer than
those old grandfather servers yet nothing is really trade only on it
either. You know why its not trade only? Because a few people started
selling things like lodizal shields for 70 k plat or something. What
that does is make selling things for plat happen. That only has to
START then it is happening forever more, people selling stuff for
thousands of plat because they know someone will sell something they
want for thousands of plat. Soon almost everything is being offered
for trade AND for cash.

Exactly. A lodizal shield is not going to be 10 k plat one day. Its a
rarity in the same way the gems for tov armor are. Its an item EVERY
character could use almost. That means that even if I buy or get one
that my other character could certainly use one also. That item will
probably be 60 k or more forever.

That is one way that EQ works well.. standard pricing. The fact that X
item is always 6 k or 60 k means that money always has value because
60 k or even 6 k is NEVER easy to get. The person wanting the 6 k for
X item knows they can sell Y and Z item to get 6 k so they sell those
items for the standard prices to buy X item at the standard price. 

Oh you say, what about Yaks and how they are cheap now? Yaks did not
get cheap because there are so many of them they got cheap because
BETTER weapons became prevelent with kunark and velious and people get
more educated about how the game works and how you should not put much
weight in the damage of a weapons proc since it often DOESN'T proc.
The ratio of a YAK sucks ass compared to easier to get stuff, some
which even has an okay proc,  that is why the price fell.

Stuff people often forget is that trade skill supplies often have a
good value. Leather padding goes for 80 - 100 plat a stack. At level 6
- 50 a bright person could buy out vendors in neriak (yes, people
honestly DON'T do this and DON'T bother to skin medium quality pelts
to low.. its AMAZING) or somewhere and make good money selling leather
paddings by the stack without even killing any of the drop mobs
themselves. My formula is just to wait a few days after a server is
up.

The EQ economy really does work pretty well, its just more of a BOOM
town economy than a game like DAOC. You might think 1 k plat for an
enamelled black bp is a lot until you know, as I do from experience,
that as a level 7 untwinked ogre on a server you have never been on
you can make enough leather paddings to sell to eventually get that.

Supply and demand IS working fine in EQ, for really all levels of
characters as long as they have know how.

I explained above how you can but it requires effort.. and initially
some money fighting monsters (though a small amount to get started)

Yes, it has nothing to do with deteriorating. Do you know what
deteriorating would REALLY do in EQ? It would make everything cost a
hell of a lot more because people would need money to constantly
replace things OR they would only start offering items in trade to
constantly replace things. I think the EQ economy is JUST FINE because
on my druid at 45th level I could scramble together the money,
untwinked, to buy Efritti boots for 9 k back when Efritti boots were
rare and I was never around people camping them. Guess what would
happen if efritti boots deteriorated? That guy would have never been
selling them because he would have had them as a back up pair OR he'd
have been selling them for 18 k plat.

Now in daoc where you can buy replacement armor at the store or from
player smiths, yeah deteriorating is fine because it did not take you
30 hours to get the item and MUNDANE things in DAOC are really good
enough.

Yep, you can't go back to the deterioration point in EQ at this point.
You'd have to totally rebuild EQ to where drops were random and good
but player made armor was sufficient and there was nearly no downtime
so players did not take 9 hours to get one piece of armor so it
deteriorating was moot and you'd have to totally scale down all the
uber mobs in EQ so instead they dropped a nice item which could be
made with a tradeskill but now cazic thule was up a lot more and could
be killed by a level 55 group of 6 people in other words you'd have to
turn EQ into.. um.. DAOC! Well see you are talking about an entirely
different game then and DAOC ALREADY EXISTS. This is probably
precisely why Verant is not making EQ improved and instead making Star
Wars Online and Planetside.

EQ works the way it does by design and its design locks it into
working that way. It is too late to change it because it would be
essentially building an entirely new game and as Verant or anyone
would say in that case you may as well just build an entirely new
game.
