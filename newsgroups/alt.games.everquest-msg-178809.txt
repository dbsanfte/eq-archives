From the shadows, the mysterious newshound007@freedom.net
(newshound007) (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Large Zelniaks? Spikies in OT? Base level resists and hp on both, the
large zelniaks in particular have poor attack numbers, neither is
social or aggressive. I doubt a necro even has to think to kill
either. I soloed both reliably from half health (as always for melee
soloers :-p ) as an untwinked warrior, at 37, with ease.

Your hatred is interesting, considering the person complaining
(MadBomma) has, unlike DT, never at any time contributed a single
thing to the newsgroup worth listening to, and indeed is probably
still killfiled by the majority after making a complete fool out of
himself months ago.
