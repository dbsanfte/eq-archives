OK, so you need the mob to get 20 hits in, that certainly happens in most combats.
And 115 points of mana isn't likely to make a difference in terms of healing power,

particularly as most fights I end up in the 80 to 90 percent mana area anyway.  Its

good to see there's something I can contribute to the fight other than my pet
hammer:)

Sure, in combat... but there's no need to cast it in combat, slap it on as the
puller
is dragging in the next victim but your MA isn't on the hate list yet... or if its
a group
DS, before the puller leaves if you like.

Can't think of a way to put MoR on a mob without getting hate though.
