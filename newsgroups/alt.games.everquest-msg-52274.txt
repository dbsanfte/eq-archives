Yeah, and I think that's complete crap, and have for more than
2 years.

To me, if something attacks me, I should get exp from it.  I don't
care if it's one millionth of one percent, if I run through the Misty
Thicket and some Bixie drone goes out of it's way to die by
riposte, I should get exp from it.

Same with vendors.  I understand that they may not like me.  That's
fine, part of my class/race/faction struggles.  But if Merchant
Imanasshole wants to jump me in Kelethin, then he should no longer
be treated as a merchant.  Give me coin, give me exp.

Boy Permafrost sure would be different...
