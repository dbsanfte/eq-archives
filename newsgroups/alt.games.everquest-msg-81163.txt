If you need someone with imagination, I have been DMing for about 12 years
now and have often had players come up to me after an RPGA tourny and ask if
I would DM their personal games.  I have an overactive imagination and a bit
of a flare for the dramatic.  I also have some skill programming.  When you
get around to the module end of things, drop me a line.

Sanity is the playground for the unimaginative.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.  And if you do.... Pictures!
