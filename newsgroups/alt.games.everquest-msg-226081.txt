Some of them are ENORMOUSLY rare.  There's a drop for a 60 druid
spell off the Sun Revs in the gray - we got shards for everyone who
came and still didn't see ONE of these drops.

My observation that they drop of 50+ mobs is just a general one and
could be more properly written "You won't see these drop off of mobs
under level 50."  

OTOH we see many advanced research drops every time we clear during
raids - our bank has a ton of them  The only problem of course is
that one rare component for each spell.

Each spell has at least one of these rare components (it's one of
the Yaeths pages for KEI) - that is the bottleneck for researching
these spells.
