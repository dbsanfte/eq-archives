*shrug*  I know a fair amount about the parts of the game I've played,
and I don't claim expertise in the rest.  I do have a pretty good idea
what all the classes can do effectively at low to mid levels, both thru
play and observation.  While there isn't an enormous amount of skill
required to be effective (the UI and other game mechanics limit purely
mechanical skills) knowledge and the experience that bring knowledge to
life are huge.  This is most true for the utility classes (all hybrids,
Bards, Shamans, Enchanters, and grouping Druids and Necromancers), but
it is important even for extreme specialists like Rogue/Warrior/Wizard.
But difference between a well played utility class, in a group that
doesn't cripple the character by demanding fullfillment of some tiny
little role that suits the group leader's tiny little mind, and one
played inexpertly is enormous.  This is why people refusing to add a
character to their group strictly because of class, and people who sit
mindlessly camping a single static spawn (SK Gnolls, for example), and
other similarly thoughtless yet popular behaviors in-game are so
irritating to me.

That is an excellent example of what I've missed out on by not being
part of a raiding guild.  It doesn't have a whole lot to do with bad
play, idiocy, and ignorance in the under 50 crowd tho.  Tell me James,
how many of your guildmates, who are facing such challenges along with
you, have a clue how to handle that situation?
