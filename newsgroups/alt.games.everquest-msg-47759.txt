Tonight, I was supposed to have gone on my first Fear raid, starting 6
pm EST. I normally don't login till 7 EST, but figured I could stretch
it. Then we were supposed to be in South Ro by 5.30 pm EST, which is
11.30 pm EST, and my mother is prone to still be making phonecalls
that late. So, I asked raid leader if I could get 10 minutes leeway in
case she was using the phone at 11.30, and he told me I could be 10
minutes late, but no more.

Turns out my mother was going away tonight (I was informed of that
last night), so there is no problem getting the phone line.

Turns out my ISP, still having its time of the month (yes, my ISP has
PMS, during which it will randomly disconnect me and/or not give me a
connection), doesn't think I should login an hour and a half early, so
I spend 20 minutes dialing, dialing, dialing before finally getting a
(crummy) line.

I login, send a tell to raid leader to ask if he'd found a replacement
for me since I am now almost 20 minutes late, but he isn't online. I
ask a friend what happened - turns out another guild had gone in 3
hours earlier, so the fear raid I was going on was canceled.

I just hope I won't have a chain of events anything like this
tomorrow, when I intend to try to kill some dark elves for my epic...
