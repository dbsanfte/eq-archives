Yeah, you already made those allegations.  You don't need to search a law
library, you can go to the link I provided.  It has all their cases (well,
at least the last decade...I didn't notice anything older, but I wasn't
looking).

People keep making these allegations but no one has yet to find a case.

I eagerly await your response with a link or case number.
