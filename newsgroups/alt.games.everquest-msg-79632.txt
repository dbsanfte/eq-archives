Thanks!  Got it last night.  Now I have to destroy all of those damned 
things.

The only weapon drop we got was another hammer, so now the CLC and SHM both 
have one.  Haven't seen any monk toys drop, yet.

Everyone leveled last night, except the Shammy who had just leveled before 
he logged the night before.  Love those DingFests.

After the 4 higher levels hit 43, we're going to move further in and test 
the waters.
