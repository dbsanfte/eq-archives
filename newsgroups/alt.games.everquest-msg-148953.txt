I was root/Dotting the non-factioned stuff (griffons, anacondas) as well as
the occasional Darkpaw gnolls in Jaggedpine.

Even the light blues (poachers, griffawns willowsps) gave pretty decent exp
for their type.

After dinging 56 Anacondas and most gnolls were still dark blue, but
griffons bumped down to light blue. Most of what was light blue before is
still that way, although I do get the occasional greenie.

My DE SK has gone from 48 to almost 51 there rather quickly, but since he's
not too worried about faction I get bears, wolves and panthers opened up to
him. He can even bank at the 'brell gnoll' section as well as buy and
sell...

I wish this zone had existed about a year ago.
