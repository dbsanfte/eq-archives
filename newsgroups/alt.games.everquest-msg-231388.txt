I'm not sure I really see a reason why the "dark god" is necessarily part of
a necromancer's training, but I'll admit to having very little knowledge of
anything necromancic (except the much beloved necrowombicon... all hail Lady
Miho).  It seems to me as if someone can study death with the same
scientific detachment as a mage could study the elements.

And it's pronounced Fraunk-in-steen!
