Depending on level, North Ro is probably a better idea.  
I like levelling near Freeport for several reasons, but 
there's kind of a nasty gap at which point you're too 
low for the stuff over the first hill, but too high for 
the newbie area.  At that point I like to head to North 
Ro and start fighting the orcs there - I find their 
levels tend to fall somewhere between the orc pawns and 
the orc cents in the Commons.  If the platform is full, 
I hang out there.  If it's empty, I hang around the edge 
of the newbie area and pull to there.

There *are* pumas, skeletons and rattlesnakes in the 
Commons, but the rattlesnake venom can really suck your 
health dry, and the pumas are so few and far in between 
it's worthless to wait for them.  The skeletons, 
meanwhile, seem to enjoy spawning in groups of two.  The 
ruins would be a lovely camp for that level, if they 
didn't decide to occasionally throw in a VERY mean ghoul 
or two in the spawn.
