I have collected 4 of these things as was going to sell them in the
bazaar but I see other vendors selling them from 40pp to 150pp.  While
I'd love 150pp each I think that is the extreme, what seems to be a
typical price on these things on your server?  Are all high quality
hides the same (cat/rockhopper/wolf etc)  These seem to be 'large' I can
only assume that is required for different tailoring outfits?
