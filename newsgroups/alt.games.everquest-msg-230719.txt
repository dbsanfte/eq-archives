Yes, but it works just fine over dial up.

No, do not buy it from someone on Ebay, you will be unable to use the 
game.  Buy a new copy.  There is really only one version, there are 
expansions however.  Whatever you install will be updated to the current 
version, along with whichever expansions you bought.  You can buy an all 
in on package that has most, if not all of the expansions included with 
the original game.

Warrior used to be regarded as about the easiest to start with, probably 
still is at this point.

First and foremost though, don't beg from other players.
