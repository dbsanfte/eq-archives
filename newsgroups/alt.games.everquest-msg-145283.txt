By endorsing Christianity through posting the commandments in
courtrooms and the like (and it *is* an endorsement of Christianity),
we effectively tell non-Christians that they are second class.

One of the many ways in which they are so historically significant is
how resoundingly Christians have been able to ignore them when it
suited their purpose.

And the fact that you insist it's true doesn't make it any more so.
Bottom line, you're claiming that the commandments are appropriate in
a courtroom. I hold that they absolutely are not. No amount of
twisting makes a middle ground there.

In which case they are utterly pointless - a courtroom is *not* a
museum, after all.

I cannot believe that after all this discussion you've completely and
utterly missed the point. 

The problem with the ten commandments being displayed on *any* public
property is that they send a message to non-Christians that their
beliefs are less valid. Posting them in a courtroom is antagonistic to
people (such as myself) who do NOT believe in Christian mythology.
