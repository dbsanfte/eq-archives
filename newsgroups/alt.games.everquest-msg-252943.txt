Dreadfully.

Trust me, I fear kited everything that could be fear kited.  My
experience was far different.  It may, however, be a matter of
perspective.  For me, by the time it was fearkitable, (low enough
level not to resist fear all the time and smack me good as it wore off
every second), it wasn't very good exp since it was several levels
below me.  However I am comparing this solo experience to the group
experience I got with the same Ranger as well as the solo exp I have
since then gotten with a Necro.  When I grouped, I grouped in very
good exp areas for his level.  At 54 to 58, I was grouping to kill
lightcrawles in PoD and gobs in PoN (level 56 to 58 mobs) when a lot
of people were still doing entrance groups (Level 45 to 54 mobs).  And
when I solo with my Necro, I usually do the toughest mobs he can kill
as they seem to give the best exp.  (Started soloing in PoP at 46,
soloed yellows and reds all along.)  In both cases, the solo exp I got
with my Ranger was a joke by comparison.
