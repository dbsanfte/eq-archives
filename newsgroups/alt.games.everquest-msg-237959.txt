Nope.  If there's no such thing as free will, then there's no such thing as
"blindingly obvious".  You simply do / think / say whatever was programmed
into the universe for you to do / think / say.  No such thing as a "right
choice" because there are no choices to be made.  My programs don't make
"right choices"; they act exactly and only on the coding.  Right choice,
wrong choice, it doesn't matter.  Evolution will, of course, occur, as it
was programmed into the universe.

(People who believe the above are still nuts, whether I'm programmed to
think that or not.)

Nope, God doesn't have to renew your "free will pass" each time you need to
make a decision.  You get created, He says "There ya go, bubuleh", and
poofters, you got Free Will (tm).
