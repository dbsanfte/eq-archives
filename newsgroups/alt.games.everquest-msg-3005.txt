Thank you... was just about to offer the same ... I suspect that caster
start off with their huge nukes is the "glory of the kill" syndrome, but
there is little glory in death.

I would add one thing to this. See if someone can throw some HP buffs on the
casters so they don't mind standing there on the occasional times they
over-Nuke. A druid who isn't the primary healer can buff the casters while
the cleric (in a well-balanced group) uses his mana to buff the tanks and
heal them.
