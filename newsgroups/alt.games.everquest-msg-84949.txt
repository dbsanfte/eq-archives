Are the naming guidelines included in the book that comes with the CD, 
mentioned in the licensing, or somewhere else?  I looked through most of 
my stuff and don't see them.  I know where they are on the net, but I 
just want to know if they are somewhere that newbies can find them 
without having to search a bunch of sites.
