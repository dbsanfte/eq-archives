Oh, right. I was referring to the no-drop vendor spells that were for
sale in PoK. I got the impression he wasn't high enough to be worried
about the post 61 spells, but I'm probably remembering that wrong.

For instance, I think O'Keils Levity used to be no-drop, but it's not
now. that's a low level one only available in PoK I think.
