Yeah, seems to be a 50/50 chance on that.  It usually has to do with whether
or not you actually wanted to port.  If you are running through the spires
on your way somewhere, you will likely port.  If you had just not had a
chance to get the shard yet, you likely won't port.  Yours was just the
exception to prove the rule.

I have received the message saying that I lack the component a few times.  I
have also ported without a shard a few times.
