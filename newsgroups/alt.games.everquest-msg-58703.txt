Hey, I think your cause is noble, and by the way, I play a Paladin and
despite their problems and everyone else's opinion of them they rock :-).

It should be mentioned just because they kill the Highpass guards that
doesn't make them evil, becuase the Highpass guards are corrupt - just kill
one of the smugglers in Highpass and you will take a faction hit with them,
as well as the FP Militia and Corrupt Guards of Qeynos.  Sad fact that those
who are to protect us are themselves evil.  But despite that, I do think the
gnolls and orcs are evil.  Also the goblins in Highkeep, even though you
start off dubious to them.

Yeah, I have avoided killing aviaks and live frogloks (although sometimes I
have considered the life of someone KOS to them more important, and killed
them in thta instance, but generally I leave them alone).  But dead frogloks
of course is a whole different story :-).

I remember killing a faerie with a group when I was lower level, and greatly
regret I ever did it.  In fact, call me soft (I am tough enough to go round
killing FP Militia guards), but I quite enjoy hanging out at the faerie
village in Lfay listening to their wings tingle.
