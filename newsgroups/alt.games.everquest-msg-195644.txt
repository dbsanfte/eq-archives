Shaman gets slow 7 levels before the Enchanter.  Levels 12 to 13, Enchanter 
slow is better.  Levels 24 to 28 Enchanter slow is better.  Level 29 and up 
shaman slow is better.

I did not start using this extensively until I got Cann III.

In PoN.  I pull with Malosini, run to zone wall, root when mob is in range, 
then slow, then DoT.  Reapply root and DoTs as needed.  This was at level 
57+.

At earlier levels, in safer zones, when I did root and rot, I pulled with 
slow, rooted, then DoTed.

Snare is awesome for making it trivial to keep out of the range of the mob 
when rerooting, which is necessary far more frequently for us shaman with 
DD DoTs.  I got to try it out with clicky snare Fungus Beast Glands 
(limited charges), and it truely trivialized root and rot.  Root and rot is 
not that hard to begin with, but with snare, it is even easier.  I don't 
recall off hand which snare that is, but it is not long lasting, needs to 
be reapplied at least once during a root and rot session in PoN.  Being 
manaless, and with the necklace, unlimited charges, it seems like it would 
be well worth it to me.
