I had it happen to me once, a friend logged in another friends epic cleric
to do it.  I believe in that case, it was a simple mistake as to which
corpse had been rezzed, they were very close to each other, and the person
doing the clicking was not an experienced cleric.

On Stormhammer, isn't everything worth petitioning?  :b
