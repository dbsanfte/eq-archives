I haven't for a while but sometimes I still do.  Usually there's at least
one other KEI whore in both Nexus/Bazaar so I can't whore myself.  I rarely
have time anyway (being a guild leader means never having nothing to do).

In answer to your question though...yes, I'd trade.  I trade for eggo as
well.  Hell for that matter if I'm hunting I'll trade for focus items (ok
scratch that, t-rod + mana-saving FI if one exists for level 60 spells :P )
or even a few weapons for my pets (I use them a lot at 60 now that they're
not nearly so buggy anymore).

Err for that matter I'll likely give KEI to any unguilded 55+ mage. <g>
