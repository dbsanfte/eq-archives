> How is that relevant? You have to hunt bats anyway

Stop right there! Is hunting bats fun? Who says you have to hunt bats for 5
hours? Is there a rule book or something written on stone tablets that were
carried down from a mountain that says this?

I still think back to some of the early CRPGs, Pools of Radiance comes to
mind. I didn't have to beat on bats for 5 hours before I could start having
fun. Starting clearing the slums, picked up some nifty magical items there,
did a few quests, cleared the trolls, really loved that game.

Sheesh! If VI could steal the exact design for the PoR slums and make it
their newbie area/dungeon, it would be perfect! Instead they have everyone
out clubbing bats and rats for hours.

Now that it seems like they are trying to rectify the situation a bit,
people bitch. Only thing I can figure is people think because they suffered,
everyone should.

People should have fun ASAP. Make it so people can have fun right out of the
gate, and more people will stick with the game. The TCC seems to be a part
of that. Not that it will work, but at least they are trying. Hell, come up
with a better idea for making the game fun right out of the box and email it
in to VI. Who knows? They may buy into it.
> Fun is subjective and has nothing to do with the discussion.

It is the crux of the discussion. Market share, marketing demographics, all
depend on how people feel playing the game. How else can you interpret TCC
other then giving more enjoyment to low level characters?

Name some improvements for newbies? Only thing you have is that laughable
trickle down theory which I don't buy and will give you the reason.

VI made things hugely better for higher level characters while the dregs are
supposed to be happy gathering what another man spills. When decaying
skeletons start dropping Runed Totem Staffs instead of rusty daggers maybe.
Not only that, they do it somewhere that you don't have a bunch of high
level characters killing them with nukes.

Newbies get to play the youngest kid in the family who gets all the hand me
downs. Just another variation in the muck shoveler role. Do you have any
younger brothers or sisters? Mine is 48 years old now and he is still pissed
off over this. Screwed his mind up for life.

Red herring? I will say you are sincere in you can't seem to grasp simple
concepts. TCC is so low level characters can enjoy getting neat stuff too.

But I will take your "stop playing it" comment to heart. I haven't seen you
this messed up since you were so cock sure you wanted to kick your friends
out of a guild for not wearing the right colors. You were wrong then, you
are just as wrong about this.

I have made it more then a few times now. Cut everything else out of my post
if it will make it easier for you to focus on it. I will keep it short.
***************************************************************
Most people other then small children<and not even all of those> don't want
you to hand them down stuff. They would much rather kill a decaying skeleton
that is carrying some. It is for those people that TCC is targetted.
******************************************************************

You really don't want to foster a hand me down society in game. Look at all
the beggers and childish behavior it has led to. It wasn't like this 2 years
ago. You end up with a population that feels good when someone gives them
something vs one that feels good because they got it done themselves.

I give up on you though. Going to cancel tonight. Maybe I will check back in
a few months to see if the TCC has had a positive effect on people. I figure
if half the people that are threatening to quit over it actually do, it will
be the best thing that could happen to the game.
