    The belt is the result of a quest where you give Azzar Habib his
Dreadful Hat back. The Hat is No Drop.

    The quest items of Quellious are also No Drop. The cloak is tradeable.

    Yes. But why? Why add an extra step in trying to obtain an item that
wasn't there before? Why annoy customers more than they are now?

>If
>they are No Drop does the TC prevent you from looting them from the

    No, I imagine the appropriate-level character would do that all by
himself. If the bank beggars are any guideline, the high level will be asked
for half his gear and his first born child to loot a quest piece. Lord, look
at what the parasites that get the cloak from Quillmane ask for! And that's
assuming there WAS an appropriate-level character there who could kill the
mob in question.

    I've levelled my Necro to 20 in The Warrens, and trust me, it's a barren
place. Half the time it was just me, or friends I had to ask to log in the
alts to play there - mostly, just me. Now imagine our questing cleric - he
has to go to the Warrens, FIND SOMEONE to help him, and THEN get lucky with
the drops? Why would anyone want to keep a player in a low-level zone for
any longer than necessary?

    WHY DO YOU WANT HIGHER-LEVEL CHARACTERS TO LINGER IN LOWER-LEVEL ZONES?
Every impediment you place in their way, like having to find someone to help
them, only makes them stay longer and screw around even more. I've seen the
people who start pulling rares to zone and hoping their "helper" can kill
it - no, your little level 12 buddy can't kill Muglwump. Oops, everyone
dies. I would MUCH rather the person zone in, gack Muglwump himself, and
zone out.

    That's not the case.

    Um, WHAT n00bs? They don't go there. Even if they DID, they don't stay
long because, surprise surprise, they tend to level pretty quickly. And then
THEY can't get loot, and have to leave. Here's some of the fun scenarios we
have to look forward to in SoL in the lower-level areas:

"Hello, PC_LFG. We need to know your exact level before you can join us, so
we know if you'll poof our phat lewt. One level too high for one of our
nameds? Get lost!"
"Mr. GM, it's unfair. Those high levels are pulling just about every mob in
the dungeon to their low-level friends whom they might as well PL anyways
since they have to be here to get the loot!"
"/auction WTB party of adventurers to go to some hellishly remote place so
you can kill a mob for me. No, I cannot bind you there as I'm a melee, I
can't res you back if you die, I can't port.... aw, forget it."
