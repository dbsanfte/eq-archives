Necros are the pet class with the tools to kite with a pet effectivly. A 
good pet, snare, and fear/ability to do high agro stuff.
Enchanters don't have snare. lil buzzsaw gets about 3/4 the swings 
chasing a feared mob that is unsnared.
Mages don't have snare or fear
I don't think beastlords have snare or fear either, but I will admit to 
not being that familier with them. But at first glance they'd have to 
agro kite with a full speed mob.
Shamans don't have fear or snare
Clerics (admittedly not much of a pet class) don't have a snare that I'm 
aware of, aside from the clicky necklace some clerics (inny) can get
Druids that pet kite with yogi should be smacked, unless it's just in 
addition to their normal damage methods. charmed pet fear kiting is a 
viable method though, as it means your charmie is usually some distance 
away when charm breaks
Let's look at other types of kiting:
DoT kiting: Besatlords aren't going to be doing this, as their shaman 
dots are most likely just an afterthought, damage wise, being a hybrid.
Nuke kiting: Concidering at 49 he has a 300 point nuke (I looked it 
up)... no. I wouldn't have concidered nuke kiting at 44 as a reasonable 
method of killing, when I had Discordant mind (508 hp nuke). I'm sure he 
has more efficient ways to solo as well.

I will grant you both are possible, but neither is a reasonable method 
for gaining xp.
Charm kiting: No charm, no charm kiting.
