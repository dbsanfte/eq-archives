For you personally you spamming piece of scum?  Well I can think of lots 
but since you don't actually read the NG they won't be seen by you.

For anyone thinking this is a good plan:

A) the fun levels are 1 to 65, if there was a way to instantly get to 
60, you'd be throwing away 60 of the fun levels of the game.

B) This guy is a spammer, and a scammer, and is offering nothing you 
couldn't pick up free by using google; in fact its readily apparant that 
that is how he created his content in the first place... but he's not 
very good at doing so because most of his information is sadly outdated

C) Try not to respond to these messages, which I note I'm failing to 
do.. this time.  But one in every ten isn't bad.  Whatever you do, don't 
quote his actual web site address, go in and alter it as I did so at 
least you aren't propagating his crap
