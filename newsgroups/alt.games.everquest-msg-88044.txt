Which video card do both of you have specifically? I'm trying to find a
match. As I mentioned in a different response, I *think* I had the 23.11
already, but now I'm not positive. Anyway, whatever I had previously was
running beautifully until yesterday, then suddenly caused the eqgame.exe
lethal error message. VI's board still points you to the 22.80 which I
now have. Yes, it allows you to start the game, but it's unplayable.

My card is an NVidia GForce 2 MX 400.
