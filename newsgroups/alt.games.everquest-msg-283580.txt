Playing around with some possible character/race combos for the 
progression servers launch, I've noticed that some very key spells are 
missing; spells that were added to the game after release.

Funny thing is, for the most part, they were added for balance or to add 
functionality to the lowbie end of the game, and often will be 
meaningless to people at the top of the level cap when the progression 
server opens up the expansion that held them.

I'm thinking spells like the HOT line for clerics, like the lowbie stuns 
for paladins... its going to be a different game without them.  Perhaps 
that will be balanced by the fact that melee will be in pisspoor gear. 
And it is "old school" without requiring any additional work on the part 
of the developers.

Anyway, I wondered if someone had already "invented the wheel" on this, 
and compiled a list of which spells will not be attainable without Kunark+

I also wonder about Tomes; are they available anywhere in the "old 
world"?  I've only seen Berserker ones in either Ogguk or Kaladim.
