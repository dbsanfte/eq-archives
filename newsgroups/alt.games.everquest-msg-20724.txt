I'm one of 4 guild leaders for my guild.

Another of the leaders emailed us saying that she just guilded a nice 24 yr
old girl with a child and who is about to get out of the house she's sharing
with her ex-husband.

I wrote back asking if she's willing to move near me and if she liked older
men (I'm 41).

She said that she was afraid the girl was in a Sally Field "Not with my
daughter" situation.  Her ex is Korean.  Oh, and she plays a level 24 high
elf wizard.

- My response was that I didn't get the movie reference, but I had no
problem with a ready-made family.
- It doesn't (should it?) bother me that her ex is Korean
- But she plays a high elf?  Ewwww, nevermind

(Just an FYI, the movie reference had something to do with her ex being
Egyptian or something, and leaving the country with her kid, and her
difficulty in getting the kid back)
