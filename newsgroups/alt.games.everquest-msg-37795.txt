ST own Amiga?

Hahahahahahahahahaha, Jesus after all these years you boys never learned?

Jesus, I wondered who all the people were in Gfay /shout 'Any spare plat for
a newb?' Now I know

Hmmm. St, shit sound , shit graphics... Amgia Excellent sound excellent
graphics... ST died, Amiga lived... ST main processor ran a little faster,
Amiga had a Blitter chip which made in inconsequential and could blit so
fast the ST cried..

Software developers wrote for Amiga in the end and down graded the software
to run on ST whereas in the beginning the ST software was ported across to
the Amiga making sound and graphics suffer.

LVL 60 Amiga warrior will fight the ST fire beetle fighting ST anyday
