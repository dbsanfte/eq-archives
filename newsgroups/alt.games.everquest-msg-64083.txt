Yes, That is true, I guess I didn't make  my self clear. There is no
line in the Client INI for:

 EQGFx_Dx8.DLL
            or
 EQFGx_Dx7.DLL

The two files are BOTH in the EQ directory, but neither can be moved
into The Client file.

Prior to the download earlier today, The .DLL was in the Client , but
I guess it really makes little difference where in the EQ directory
they are located.

Comments?
