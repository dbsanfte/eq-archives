Funny you should say that.  At level 23, I got a KEI for my druid, ran him 
out to Stonebrunt (can't port there until 24), and didn't bother with root 
and rot.  Snare, dot, nuke, nuke, run a bit, nuke, nuke, run a bit, repeat 
until mob is running, melee him to death.  Pull next mob (I am at full mana 
after all), rinse repeat.  This is against dark blue cats, and the green 
willow wisp thingies.  Went to Paludal, tracked dark blue Ptargs, and 
shriknar.  Snare, dot, pincushion with as many nukes tossed in as I can get 
channelled.  Cure disease 3 times, heal to full.  When doing one at a time, 
my mana bar slowly went down, when I got an add, mana bar went down a bit 
faster.  With KEI going those fights in Paludal went from potentially 
challenging to trivial.  With the kill rate I was sustaining against the 
low dark blues, I saw no reason to find a more challenging spot to hunt, as 
the xp was just piling in.  It was a fun diversion, but, it would get 
boring pretty fast I think, it just made it too easy.
