The one thing I can think of that the necro brings to the table over
the SK are better dots.  And since it's never a good idea for fear
kiting fights to last long, the dots just don't get the chance to work
to thier full potiental.  A good Ogre SK would be able to channel Fear
through most anything, especially if a shammy has allready slowed the
critter down to start with.

Good point about the bard.  I've done a lot of fear kiting with my
friend's bard, and she's able to do everything you'd possibly want in
that group, snaring, fearing, tracking, and speed running.  They're
perfect for the job.  So, yeah, build the group around the bard, SK
for tanking shoud it need to be done, Rogues for backstab, and maybe
even a wizard to keep the fights short.

Good thing about fear kiting groups, you don't honestly need a healer
about, nor do you need a full group. After all, if you had access to
six people and healers, why not go to a dungeon?
