Yep, seen this quite a lot myself. The `lag-o-meter' shows everything
as being fine but every element of the client runs incredibly slowly.
Even things like moving the mouse or running a multi-line macro. It
makes turning around an adventure in itself.

And once it `occurs' that zone is bugged. Was doing language lessons
in Grobb last night when Innothule swamp developed the problem for
both I and the other guy. Grobb zone was perfectly normal, zone into
innothule and its lag city. A situation which survived through 30+
zones.

I've had it happen in Upper Guk (hard enough to navigate as it is),
Cazic-Thule and now Innothule.
