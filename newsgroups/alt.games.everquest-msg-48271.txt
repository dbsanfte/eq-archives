Got to agree they don't look good so far, the models aren't too bad but the
skins on them are pretty uninspiring.
Not sure if I would be quiting the game for that reason, well ok, I know I
won't. I'll quit when I'm bored not when I don't like the way it looks.
If perferct imagery was required to hold your interest then you'd have quit
long ago. Not noticed how many models have gaping holes in them when viewed
from the right (wrong) angle? Take a look at a hill giant or cyclops or even
female humans.

To compare to the competion;

You think these are any better?
I don't.
It looks like this is the way forward(?) and if the graphic engine works
efficiently then great. I'll be happy.
As for shadows (mentioned in someone elses post)  well, I'd rather have a
decent framerate than too much eyecandy. I hope they up some of the detail
but I also hope they go along the Quake route and allow us to turn off what
we don't want, need or can't handle.
