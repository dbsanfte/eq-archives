So basically you're saying "oooh it's too difficult"? If you are fioghting
low blues you can easily use root parking as CC even in tight spots. Against
low blues a decent AC tank can take a beating from 2-3 at a time without
breaking a sweat. And all this is purely during the break - you only have to
do it once. If you get a mixed caster/melee pull, root the melees and kill
the casters - all they do is cast easily resisted spells while meleeing
weakly and having 70% percent of the HP of their melee friends.

LOIO and OT have _broken_ amounts of exp. Sorry, but I levelled there a
little with some twinks recently and Im not surprised people spend their
lives fearkiting in these zones. It really is just TOO easy to make the
yellow bar move. But then I've always had contempt for fearkiting unless
done by solo casters/caster pairs because I prefer the standup fight over
degenerate tactics.

Like I said, only on the break.

Ive used necros and bandages to heal indoors as well. If you can do it
outdoors, you can do it indoors if you apply yourself. Yes Ive even seen
people kite and fearkite in dungeons.

 And escape? Outdoors, run with SoW, pull to a zone line, or
> just Fear the damn mobs away and go zone. Indoors? Train and pray, or
evac.

Or run with sow if the zone allows it (Karnors) or pull to a zoneline
(pretty much anywhere expect HS) or cast AoE fear and run like hell. They
all work indoors too. . .
Again, I cannot understand people who's first reaction to considering a
dungeon hunt is "how will we escape with no SoW!?!?!?". Other than the
evaccer requirement of some dungeons i NEVER worry about exit strategies. I
just focus on staying alive.

It also describes several dungeons of his level which was my point. You just
need to know where to look.

Like I said, it CAN be crowded. It can also be sparsely populated at times.

King, Eye and Raster leaves a HELL of a lot of unpulled Frogs.

I first went into Seb with 5 level 45s and did fine. No cleric either.

Risk/Reward in action. It's a great zone for anyone who goes and learns it.
Easily the best zone of the Kunark expansion and contender for "Best Dungeon
Ever". To deny yourself the pleasure of hunting there because you may need
to buy a couple of coffins on your first trip is to do yourself a great
disservice.

/assist is all you need when a raid is going well. In borderline situations
and tricky CRs well-drilled groups of hardnosed dungeon players will often
tip the balance in your favour. I've seen a bad pull of 9 mobs in Hate where
the first 5 casualties were all 3 Enchanters and the 2 highest level
clerics, yet we still won and averted a CR. There was a hell of a lot more
going on in that fight than just /assist and none of us would have made it
if it wasn't for half a dozen raid members having the presence of mind and
the instinct to take split second decisions, knowing that others there were
reacting the same way, and get the situation under control. I guarantee that
those LOIO->OT Powerlevevellers were just standing there panicking and
wishing there was a zone they could SoW-run to. . .

I'd imagine you found your l33t Fearkiting skillz and SoW-running prowess of
pretty limited use too? I mean, ToV I will give you, but Velks and Hate are
hardly raid zones. My guild sends exp groups to the lower floor of Hate. We
don't do the top floor because it is simply the worst place to go in the
entire game ever. With the exception of the bosses Velks is a single group
zone throughout and was even before they wimped the mobs.
Now you seem to be getting a little out of shape cos I aimed a general rant
at Jakugg even though he is a decent guy but Im an officer in a big guild,
Im in charge of tactics and Ive been around a long time. And im sick to
death of explaining elementary things to people who are still newbies at
level 55. I'm even more fed up of people who think they want to raid after
levelling up in 3 months but find they don't have the stomach or endurance
for it and just whine all the time about loot, about exp, about not being
ressed fast enough. If you and jakugg don't fall into these categories then
good for you but I sure as hell run into far too many that do.
