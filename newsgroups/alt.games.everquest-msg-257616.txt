Letssee... Recent Previous patches got us:
    o Floors that collapse when you walk on them, sending you
plunging to your death
    o Stairs that if you walk down you get 20000 hp damaged


Todays patch we get these new goodies:
    o Nametags that annoyingly change size
    o New Skyspheres which are out of balance
    o New anti-targeting fog system, everything over 5 feet away
is fogged out.
    o New junk at ldon merchants which will probbably require a
rollback to fix
    o New Frame Rate Cap slider which is unusable (since we have
no FR meter)
    o A "Fixed" Clip Plane slider which now only adjusts 5 feet.

Did I miss anything?

Happy Patch Day.
