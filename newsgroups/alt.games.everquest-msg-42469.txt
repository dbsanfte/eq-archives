This day and age, it's very rare to see a human anything, aside from Monks
and for some reason Paladins.  Before verant took away / all count, I used
to keep tabs on race/class combos and I noticed that Human Clerics, Rogues,
Warriors, Rangers, Druids, and Bards, tended to be over level 50, presumably
because they have been playing since a time when optimal starting stats
wasn't the prime reason for choosing a race.  Under 30, I've noticed that
the breakdown looks like this:

Clerics Dwarf/High Elf
Rogues Wood Elf/Halfling
Warriors Troll/Ogre/Barbarian
Rangers Half Elf
Bards Half Elf
Druids Female Wood Elf/Male Halfling

This seems to indicate that newer players are choosing te race with the
"best" starting stats for class X.  This leads to the stereotype that anyone
who is class X, and didn't choose the right race, is a bad class X.
