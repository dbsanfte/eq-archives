EQ will run fine for anywhere from 5 minutes to several hours then,
suddenly, it stutters for a moment (sort of freezes for a second or so
but doesn't black out, as if hitting a momentary lag spike) then I
start hearing bell tones with almost every key I hit.  It sounds like
the sort of tone you get when the computer is "complaining" about you
trying to do something you can't, a simple error tone, but nothing
else is running to cause it.  Typically, but not always, this is
accompanied by the mouse locking up.  Hitting esc then Alt+F4 will
free up the mouse but the bell tones continue.

At first, I expected EQ was opening some other application in the
background by mistake and it was causing some errors.  Thus the reason
for trying esc then Alt+F4 to see if it would end it and my discovery
that this frees up the mouse.  When exiting EQ, however, no new
applications are running and everything that is running is the same as
it was before starting EQ.  The only way to correct the issue is to
exit out of EQ completely.

I've tried disabling virtually everything on the system one at a time
and this still occurs.  There are no appearant IRQ conflicts, I've
checked in two different methods.  It has nothing to do with the
motherboard overhearing, I've checked that.  I've even cycled out my
memory sticks to see if one of them was bad and somehow causing it but
all to no avail.  I'll include a few system stats below but I wanted
to know first if anyone else has experienced this, if its a known
problem, and if there was a general cause and fix before I start
trying to diagnose the little details.  Any ideas?
