Lake of Ill Omen took me from 20 to 30 in no time at all.  As a shaman, I
had no trouble finding a group and it was easily solo'd when I didn't feel
like a group.
The loot is nothing spectacular, but the experience is pretty much non-stop.

Frontier mountains will get you through 30-35 pretty quickly and once you
hit 35-36, head to iceclad and eastern wastes.  I'm bouncing back between
eastern wastes and the great divide now that I'm 39 and plan to be here for
a couple more levels

These areas worked very well for my shaman and the experience gain has been
great in all of these zones.

Hope this helps.

Harken
