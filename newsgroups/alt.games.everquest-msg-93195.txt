Are you enchanting the metal?

It's been a few months, but I don't recall spending nearly that much
money at that skill level.  In fact I think I almost made money.  200
int, around 150 cha.

I kept a complete record from around 200 to 250, maybe I'll dig it
up and post it.

Others will disagree, but I think it helps to keep your cha buff up
while combining.
