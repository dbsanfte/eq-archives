And the timer will start running from zero right at the very
instant he zones in, just as it did at the very instant when
-you- zoned in.  You each have exactly the same amount of time to
complete the mission; only group B has 70% more mana than you do
at their start.  

Of course we know that your groups are outrageously uberpowerful,
and you deliberately go into LDoN dungeons with a full group of 6
on Normal setting even though they are almost painfully easy for
you.  So being low on mana doesn't hurt you, and you never ever
need the full time you are permitted.

But for the 99% of EQ players who find LDoN challenging at
normal, or who actually go for Difficult or use 5 or 4 man groups
if 6 man Normal is easy, that timer Does matter.  The timer that
runs a half hour from when you pick a mission to when you run out
of time to enter, on the other hand, is "buff up, get to the
dungeon, last chance to pee or get a soda" time, it won't matter
one bit to your ability to complete the mission on time how much
of that "ready time" you spend.  

And nobody is suggesting it takes 29 minutes to buff up and get
to full mana, either; at worst it might take group B five minutes
longer to enter than it does group A; thats assuming group B has
no mana regen enhancements at all, though, which is unlikely if
they see an LDoN run as challenging.
