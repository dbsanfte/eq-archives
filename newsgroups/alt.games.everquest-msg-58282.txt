Umm?  lol im not trying to backpedal any earlier posts.  I have NEVER said
im anywhere near to uber, ive never said my gear is kick ass, so stop making
stuff up to try and reinforce your posts.

Gear nothing special? So what if my SK has a fungi tunic, my monk leveled
the hard way with worst gear then a lot of monks you probably know (as i
said on another thread today, I concentrated on leveling and not gear)
Just to give you a few facts, so maybe you stop talking about your arse,
level 50 magician with 4 cloth items
a monk with no haste until 49 (a donated fbss), a monk wearing a ccs until
level 54, drolvarg mantle until late 50's, only fighting batons in the early
50's for weapons (some ninja and scamming events in the 50's took certain
other weapons)

So yeah, im a fucking uber twinked power leveler who had it easy right?
Shut the fuck up when you don't even know 1 thing what your posting about
me.

Yes you must, what the fuck do you think "(not ultra red mobs" means?!
Thanks for quoting where you were wrong, saved me having to.   HTing a 50
mob when I was 6 isn't what you said, you thought I meant killing level 50
mobs for exp at level 6 (just the thought of that is a joke)

And i quote "Well, I guess you *were* powerleveled quite a bit, weren't you?
Fighting lvl 50 mobs at level six and endless streams of reds might have
left you
not much opportunity to learn the SK in group strategies"

HTing a mob doesnt imply fighting a mob, I even said "when i was being
stupid" which im sure doesn't take more then half a brain to think maybe im
refering to HTing the general in OT and seeing how many seconds i last (or
any other 50+ mob)

My SK wasn't made as a group character.  and no, its never grouped with a
warrior. I grouped with a guild magician and a monk friend back in OT days
for a short while, and ever since (and before) it has been solo.

Your talking about out damaging, what the fuck has a 6 dmg/tick dot got to
do with damage? Don't make me laugh.

If you had a clue, you'd realise damage is only 1 part of agro.  this has
already been covered in previous threads, go read them and educate yourself.
No the SK won't out damage the warrior, can it out taunt it though?  hell
yes it can compete with agro (more often then not when ive seen it, both end
up getting beat on, both need heals, and the cleric has to med more)

im sorry your jealous of my being level 60

I agree, they can also be done without a tank, without a chanter, without
<insert key character for dungeon zones>
I did Necro with me and a guildie epic mage pet as the only melees in the
group, and we did absolutely fine.  I've done certain camps with no evacer,
no chanter (or even a bard), places with a shaman instead of a cleric for
heals.   I didnt even mention uber guilds, ive never even remotely implied
im in an uber guild, stop looking for excuses.

You missunderstood.  All my posts about agro are from the monks perspective
(who has always grouped, never twinked or powerleveled)  if i was a 58 SK,
im quite sure a 53 warrior could hold agro if only he was taunting.
