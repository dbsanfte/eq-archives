It's interesting that one of the reasons they gave, I seem to recall, for
only allowing one character per server in SWG was the cost of storing
characters.

An EQ character probably does actually take a fair amount of storage.  Last
time I tried to estimate it, I came up with, I think, something like 8k or
so (don't overlook all those factions you have to keep track of, the
contents and order of things in the spell book, and the buffs that may be on
you and their remaining durations), and that was not counting any database
overhead...that was just the size for the data itself.

I told my boss about that one.  We are one of the few internet companies
that isn't losing money, and part of that is because we try to find a way to
get people to pay for pretty much everything that one can conceivably charge
for.  I told him Sony gets people to pay $50 to move a character from one
server to another (which might involve actually moving data from one
database to another, but might mereley involve changing the "server" field
in the character record in a single game-wide character database and
deleting all the characters items) to play with their friends, and wondered
if there was some way we could come up with a way to get people to pay for
such a trivial operation.  My boss said that was too greedy even for an
internet company. :-)

I could see $50 if that included having a GM actually look at your
character, and decide what equipment really should be deleted.  $50 for a
naked transfer is just ridiculous.
