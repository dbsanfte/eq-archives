HQ tundra kodiak skins can be sold to people doing the coldain quest.  Other
than that the loot is bad, but the experience makes up for it.
 
>On a side note, who drops the rygor armor? 

The elites inside the rygor fort drop the armor.  They are still dark blue and
very hard for me at level 51, with full mana.  I never try them alone.  The
chief drops the chest piece, which is great for rangers, (as are some of the
other drops).
The other rygors drop velius weapons and orc fang earrings and average several
plat a piece.

Make sure you harmony the one in the middle of the group.  You can usually see
a "blue haze" surround the ones that are harmonied.  Then pull the one closest
to you, so that as it comes towards you it will not pass by any others, which
will draw them too.
