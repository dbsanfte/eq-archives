The levels and AAs probably make more difference than the equipment, once a 
certain level of equipment is reached.  Either way, levels, and spells, as 
well as likely gear available are better than what we had to work with in 
my guild.  Equipment wise, think a few pieces of Skyshrine quest armor as 
the high end for us.  For me as the shaman, no Malo, no Torpor, do have 
Tigir's.  Had some difficulty slowing the executioner, but was doable.  Did 
not attempt to slow the other mobs, as we had an enchanter to lock down the 
adds, and the mobs were going down fast enough that slow was not worth 
casting.
