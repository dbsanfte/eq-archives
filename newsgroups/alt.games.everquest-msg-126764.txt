If you make dwarf steaks, or something to that effect, and hand it to a
Dwarf NPC, do they get offended?  I don't know why I would want to try
something like that, but I saw a few recipes for "race" recipes and was
wondering.  If there is indeed and effect, could you possibly feed some to
Ogre NPC's for faction?

Tia,
SEAN...
