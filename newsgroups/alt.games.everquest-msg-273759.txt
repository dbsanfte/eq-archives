I came to WoW and EQ2 with no real experience of the lore behind
either.  My initial impression was the opposite of yours--that WoW had
more and deeper backstory, and that WoW's quests were much more
integrated into the ongoing story of the world.

It might well be that I didn't play EQ2 enough to start seeing the more
story-driven quests--I only reached level 12 or so.  It's also possible
that starting location has something to do with this; I think the
low-level night elf quests in WoW are more interesting than the human
ones.

My impression may also be colored by the setting: I found EQ2's
simplistic division between a "good" and "evil" faction with a single
city per side to be very bland.

That's because you haven't reached the hard part yet.  WoW is designed
to appeal to both casual and hardcore gameplay styles--a casual player
can play all the way to level 60 without trouble.  That's just the
start of the game, however; the hardcore game really begins at 60. 
Before 60, it's always possible to leave a task until you're high
enough level to make it easy; post level-cap, that's not an option.

This just seems odd to me.  "I spend 100% of my game time doing quests
and  *almost* incidentally killing things along the way." -- that's
exactly how I'd describe WoW.  I'm certain there's someone, somewhere,
who is grinding in WoW, but I strongly suspect they're in a minority.

EQ2 may well be the same; I was quest-focused there as well for the
levels I played it.  I do note that a common complaint I hear in this
group, however, is the difficulty of finding a group that wants to do
anything other than grind.  I suspect that having a good guild of
friends to play with makes EQ2 a *much* more enjoyable experience for
you than for someone without that support--not that any game isn't
better with friends, but EQ2's group-orientation may makes that support
group far more important.

High-end instances, raids, and realm-vs-realm battlegrounds.
