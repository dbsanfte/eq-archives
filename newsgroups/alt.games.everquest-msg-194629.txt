It's like with D&D - the reported suicide rate among Everquest players
(something like 1 in 300,000 over four years) used to bash EQ is much,
much lower than the average suicide rate (which tends to something
like 1 in 10,000 every year in the "western world", IIRC). So
Everquest is good for you, it makes you less likely to commit suicide.
