But for those with the faith that believes the Genesis account of creation,
the fish were created by the same being that created man.  Therein lies the
difference ... the deity both creates and allows to live.  Therefore, why
would this omnipotent being create evil?  He/she/it wouldn't, any more than
you would create the bullying gourami if you had the chance to build your
fish from the scales up.

Given that, again assuming a creationist point of view, some other force has
to be in play.  To quote a popular saying from my childhood in the 70's ...
"The Devil Made Me Do It".

It comes down to an opinion .. or belief structure.  That's certainly one
concept, but the whole "The Devil Made Me Do It" idea is just as certainly
another (hence exorcisms and all that jazz).  There are others, depending on
the religion being discussed.

Which one is right depends on the individual, I suppose .  In any case, the
point is pretty much moot ... the mean person (or fish) keeps right on being
the way they are until an outside force causes them to change or kills them
outright.

Sometimes that outside force is religious conversion.  But where, exactly,
does that come from?  The individual?  God?  A holy spirit?

Yet another $64,000 question.

I'm not saying that it does.  But what I am saying is that I find it
interesting that while a percentage of folks (and I believe that they were
Christians ... I wish I could find the link) surveyed believe in a
benevolent supreme being, a significantly smaller percentage believe in a
'devil' or 'hell', even though both are described in their holy text (again,
assuming we're talking about Christians).

It seems to me that if you believe in the yin, the yang comes with the
territory.
