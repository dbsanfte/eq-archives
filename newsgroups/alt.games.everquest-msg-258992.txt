	One advantage to a manual on cd, in pdf form, is that years
later when I go back to play the game, I don't have to worry about
having lost my manual.  If I have the game, I have the manual.  For
windowed games they are especially nice, can have the manual and the
game open on the same screen.  Not many windowed games out there
anymore though.  Ya do see indie games that are windowable a lot
though, and some of the mainstream games have it as an option as well
by use of a flag or whatever.

	On the other hand, I like having a good printed manual.  I can
pick it up and look through it while the game is going.  I sometimes
read most of a manual before I even start a game.  Other times I jump
right in sight unseen and read the manual as needed, as I go.  I like
them best when they have an *index* since I mainly use them just to
find some specific piece of info real quick.  I almost always skip
over sections like 'the story so far' and just get into the meat.  

	So I'd rather have a good printed manual over a pdf on a cd,
but on the other hand, I'd rather have a good pdf on a cd than a
crappy printed manual.  If the game is windowed, then I might rather
have the pdf most of all though, no alt-tabbing out necessary to read
it.  Better than either of those choices is to have have a game that
has all the info I want right at my finger tips - but such is very
rare.  FPS's often manage to do it, but they are simple games.  Can I
look up unit stats, how to do this or that, anything else I could
possibly need or just plain want to know, w/out having to click
through several screens to hunt for it?   Can I look it up w/out even
having to actually start a game?  By this I mean, ya start the game,
but ya can't look anything up yet because ya just have a menu.
Several menus later, you have now chosen a scenario, settings, what
have you, and started a game.  After everything's loaded, *then* ya
can start clicking through screens hunting for the info ya want.  Not
very convenient, even if the info is readily available once you're
into the game proper.  And if that's all they got, then I'm back to
preferring the manual again, which is usually the case (takes me
seconds to find what I want in a printed manual)

	I would like it best of all if games came w/their associated
nice glossy strategy guides.  I don't buy strategy guides because I
can't stand the idea of paying more than the initial up front price
for a game.  That doesn't mean I dislike them, just that I dislike
*paying* for them.  And I know its a pipe dream to wish they'd be
included w/the games, but I wish it all the same. hehe

	I also wish more games would have in their manual what ports
it is I need to have open in my firewall in order to host an MP game.
I hate having to repeatedly look such info up on the net everytime I
reformat, reinstall the game a year a later, what have you.

	Am I typical?  I have no idea.  In my social group out in RL,
except for a few friends who buck the general trend, most people I
know don't even play video games at all, except maybe football on a
console and the odd FPS.  My only view into the rest of the game
playing public is through the internet.  Only there can I find people
as nerdy as me.
