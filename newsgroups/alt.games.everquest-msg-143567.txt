Weighted Axe, 45/150, Large races only.
I've heard of SoW'd warriors trying to 'melee kite' with this:
run up and whack the mob, run off with auto-attack off, when
attack recycles stop and whack the mob again, rinse-repeat.
Dunno if that tactic has more than novelty value (probably not)
but it sure sounds like the sort of thing a certain, er,
creative, yeah that's the word: creative, player best known as
a high level cleric would try.  :)
