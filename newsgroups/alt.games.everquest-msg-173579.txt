I am going to start a BL soon, and was looking at their pets.  After a 
while there seems to be a LONG time between getting a new pet ( like 10 
levels I think it was ).

Is this right, or did I misread the spells?

What level are the warders that you summon at the different levels?  Will a 
specific pet spell "grow" with the BL or is it like the other pets where a 
level X pet spell always summons a level X pet?

It seems like a pet that doesn't grow through the 10 levels that you have 
it is going to be pitifully weak at the end of the line to me.
