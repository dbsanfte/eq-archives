There was something on Graffe's... Ah here we go, from the Wizardly FAQ in 
their forum library:

Q: What is 'Specialisation' ('Specialization')
                                 
A: This is an interesting one. Its an example of Verant's description 
having little resemblance to reality. They claim that you have a 
percantage chance when you cast for this skill to kick in and save you 
some of the mana cost. The chance is meant to be governed by you skill in 
specialisation for that given discipline of specialisation.
                                 
Q: What are the 'Specialisation' skill caps?
                                 
A: One discipline may be up to skill level 200 dependant on your level, 
whilst the rest are capped at 50.

Q: So what really happens with 'Specialisation'?
                                 
A: You save a percantage of the spell cost on every cast, the amount 
contingent upon your specialisation skill in that discipline.

Q: How do you know? Thats not what I heard!
                                 
A: Because someone used a packet sniffer to check it out (See ShowEQ).

Q: How much do I save per cast with a 'Specialisation' at 200?
A: 10%.

Q: And at 50?
A: 2.5%. (Can you see a pattern? <grin>)
