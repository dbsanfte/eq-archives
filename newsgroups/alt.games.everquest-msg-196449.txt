Those giants are actually slower than L30ish SoW, but not very much.
This means that a bit of video lag will make you slower than them
(mattered more when the zone was popular).  It also means that the
brief slowdown that occurs when you are hit can make you slower
than them, i.e. you can't get them to stop hitting you because they
won't stop hitting you.  When I used to hunt there a lot I just
used the same techniques I learned in EC/WC to escape from bears:
leave all video options that can add to lag turned off and use
jump (spacebar) to get a speed edge.  I never got cut down fleeing
(with SoW) after my first couple trips there.  Of course, Root _is_
a great way to get a head-start, especially when you don't have SoW.
