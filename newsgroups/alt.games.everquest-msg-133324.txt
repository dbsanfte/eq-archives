}She sings in /gu non-stop

I just wanted to speak up in defense of singing in /gu.  I, for one, enjoy 
it when people sing in /gu.  It can liven up a dull camp.  Non-stop or 
poor choice of material could be a problem, of course.

But keep on singing. :)

I didn't think much, however, of the guildie I had briefly who was always:

Guildie tells the guild, "Guildie winamp ---> Song_I_never_heard_of.mp3"

But I had other issues with him, anyway.
