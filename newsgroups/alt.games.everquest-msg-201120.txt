Ok so it is only for level 60 - 65 ?
Not something that I have to worry about then.

I guess that the other side of the question is about the lower levels more.

What is the maximum gain you can get from one kill and does this kick in 
before the xp is group split ?

E.g say you have one low leveler (35) in a higher level group (all 50) 
They are obviously going to be killing things that are quite red to the 
low leveler. Now I know that there is a "you can't get more xp than this 
for a singel action" cap somewhere. Does it get applied to the low 
levelers xp before or after the xp is split ? and before or after any 
grouping bonus ?

Thanks for the pointer,

Jim
