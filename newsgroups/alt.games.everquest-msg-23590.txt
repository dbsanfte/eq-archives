True, but I think a html post would be considerd a grey area

Yea they referanced paypal but they are <cough> just providing a
service <cough> which I dont belive is wrong under the EULA. 
Now it they were selling an item for cash, yea that would be wrong but
to provide an in game service , I would say this is again a grey area.

So you are one that will enjoy living in corprate ran america, where
every law is dictated by large corprate giants... Oh wait that is
where we are now. Just look at the DCMA. What a piece of crap
unconstitutional law. oops i digress.

Well I can see that we are at the end of the debate, thanks for
letting me play devils avocate and not running to my isp to ban me.


Have a great day.
