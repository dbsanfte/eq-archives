Just a  thought but ummm....

How about more Vox & Naggy logic.  Hit Aggro and to high level?  Poof, out
of zone you go.

Another idea:  Install some of the Tranix Darkpaw code stuff for high levels
who do what you describe.
You know the guy from Blackburrow where if a to high level person goes into
the zone he spawns upstairs and waits for them -- not bothering the little
folks but just hunting for the mid levelers...  Load up some high level
critter that spawns -- no decent loot but say 65th level uber avenger that
skips the little guys and slaughters the high levels trying to PL or side
step the green farming code...  that would slow down a lot of that stuff
fast -- first time your 60 Druid / Cleric, etc..  got waxed by this uber
avenger would be about the time you swore off of the farming business for
that zone.

Personally I like the Vox Naggy solution the best.  Aggro from a greenie and
you get bounced from the zone.  That would effectively shut down farmers and
could be implemented all over the land.  No more "I think I'll go farm
runnyeye for some stuff..." or "I'll take jojo to CB and PL him up a bit..."
poof, back in Greater Faydark, poof back in Misty...  of course they would
have to rework some stuff to keep travel open but it would be funny as hell
to see some shrieking bard or druid losing it because they got bounced from
Rathe Mountains by a green hill giant or from Everfrost for a green Ice
Giant...  Might make the release of that fix a blast to just sit in the
bounce zones and get a good laugh as the green campers lost their tempers
about it ;)
