Right-click on it.  It will tell you which classes and races can use it.  I
believe that's the thing with 20 mana and all/all (all classes, all races),
right?

Someone should give you a link to a ranger site.  I don't know all of the
information you're looking for, but the final answer is this;  yes, it's
worth giving up your shield.  I know of no dual wielding class that ever
holds a shield once they have this skill.
