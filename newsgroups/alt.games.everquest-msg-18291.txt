The "odds" say most assault victims know their attackers. If you got mugged by
someone you had never met before, and went to the police station to report it,
how would you feel if the police threatened you with obstruction of justice
until you admitted you did know the attacker, and gave their name?

That, in a nutshell, is the approach you and Verant are in favor of.




================================================

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
