not to mention he doesnt count.

out of 400,000+ players, 1 idiot quitting because he is pissed that after 15
days of flawless gaming, verant has the servers down for 1 day, and he
thinks its his right to be pissed off.

what the fuck would happen if they never fixed the bugs that let monsters at
lvl 2 do insane amounts of damage to you? or that your item that you worked
hard to get wasnt proc'ing right?

shut the fuck up before you speak next time, and be greatful.
