Interesting point you raise here.  I mean surely it can't be that they
want to keep you under control so they can focus the in game mind
controls on you in a fashion that allows them to keep track of
assimilation progress since they know if you are logged in you are
absorbing the mind control rays, so then maybe they are using this as a
tool to prevent folks from logging in and using resources on the VI
network when in fact they aren't playing but actually downloading porn
or chatting up f0xY1@dy666.  Never considered that, but it certainly is
an interesting feature of the design, might actually be a better thing
than folks realize.

But if you really need to communicate via PC with the rest of the world
while you play you may want to build a com set.  A pc that is worth very
little in business or gaming still makes an ok com set.  Get your hands
on an old P-133 or some such and load it up with Sygate or similar if
needed so you can share a dial up connect with your gaming PC, then drop
your favorite email, browser and chat software on it.  Boom, you can
play and still chat, email, check maps or even grab some of that nasty
porn all while remaining in game.  This actually is far superior to
jumping in and out of game since EQ has no pause button and even safe
spots can be dangerous when no one is watching the screen.  Folks you
may be grouped with will appreciate this over Alt+Tabbing as well. 
Nothing worse than puller coming back to find that chanter is on the
porn pipe and cleric is chatting with aunt sally.
