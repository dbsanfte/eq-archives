Hmm... found more info, particularly on bard songs, in the thread 
following the wizards faq in the graffe's library.

}I didn't think ( although I could very easily be misinformed) that GOI

Yes, they do, 1 per tic and 2 per tic, I think.  However, Insight, 
Brilliance, and Gift of Magic, and um... that other 'Gift of' one... have 
no mana regen.  

}No idea what theft of though or wandering mind are... chanter mana 
}steals? 

Yea.  ToT is the instant steal... 25 mana to cast, steals 346-400 mana
Wandering Mind is over time and knd of lame, really.  5 mana gets you 6 
mana/tic for 2 minutes.  3min refresh time.  I guess the only lame part is 
there's better ways to use that spell slot. :)

}Is the Druid mana regen self only wolf form "form of the howler"

I -think- that's the one. Yea, 2mana/tic
