Recent program changes briefly made it more difficult to level for
some styles of play in the post 50 range.  These changes were
dropped, now soloing is just as good as it ever was, however
certain other styles of play now give much better exp than
they used to.

To sum up: it is not in any circumstances more difficult than
it used to be to level up.  On the other hand, people using
the old "best" techniques might now find some friends sending
them tells laughing about how slowly they are leveling up.
