You don't need to reach a minimum level to enter the Plane of Knowledge,
which is the hub that can now be used to travel to many of the zones
throughout the game. As to entering the other planes that are a part of that
expansion, it seems that they are of reletively high level, around 45+.

You can get to the Plane of Knowledge through any of the portals that are in
ALL of the starting newbie grounds.  They look like a pedestal with an open
book on top of it.  To get to POK all you do is click on the book.

There is not yet a map of the PoP zones at EQAtlas, but there is a listing
of the various portals and their locations in their respective zones.
