Not really. One thing I'll say for SWG, from a strictly technical 
perspective, is that the graphics and the world in general were 
*stunning*. I mean, it really is a generation or two ahead of EQ. 
Leaving Norrath and stepping foot onto one of the SWG planets was, 
literally, like stepping out of a cartoon and into a movie. If they can 
make the transition of the basic EQ game into that level of environment 
it's going to be a killer.

You see, it wasn't the technical glitches bugs that drove me away from 
SWG. Yes, they were there in the tens of thousands and the game was 
almost totaly broken. (In fact the "gold" version they released was 
actually significantly worse than how the beta build was in the last 
weeks before it went live.) But I had gotten myself into such a mindset 
where I was bound and determined to find a way to like that game, that I 
was willing to put up with the bugs. I figured that eventually SOE would 
have gotten most of them fixed. (Even if it took years)

That wasn't the problem. I'd have stayed and helped them continue to 
debug it if the underlying game was good. But it wasn't. Particularly if 
you were used to the challenges of EQ. There was no end game. There was 
no point in leveling. And it was just way, way, way too easy. I was able 
to max out my character with all skill points spent and being a master 
of several professions, including two elites, in about four weeks. And 
even with that level of accomplishment and the gear I could afford being 
a literal millionaire, anybody could come in to SWG, play for about 
three days, and have a fair chance of one shot killing me. It was just 
freaking pointless. And there was no content. No loot that wasn't 
literally just baubles and trash. The only usable items were all player 
made. And the only way to have any serious adventures were in non 
consentual PvP mode, which practically nobody wanted.

They tried to change the very fundamental concepts of a MMORPG. And they 
did! But it produced a total piece of shit. My hope for EQ2 is that they 
will keep the basic premise of the game in place in terms of 
advancement, Environmental content (vs. PvP content), loot, etc. and 
transplant that onto the next generation game engine. If they manage 
that, it could be something really special.

I think you'll see *some* fundamental changes, which they've wanted to 
do in EQ but couldn't. For example, they wiped out twinkiing, 
powerleveling, and spawn camping in SWG. It can't be done. (Ok, now that 
I think about it, their spawn camping fix won't work in EQ without 
totally screwing the game. But they will probably stop twinking and 
powerleveling.) But I'm hoping most of the fundamentals of EQ will ride 
over to the new version.
