Until I hear otherwise, I am assuming it is working as intended.

If you eat/drink it, you will lose the stats, as you will no longer have the
food/drink in question.  Try it.

It has to be the first food/drink item in your inventory, does not have to
be at the top of your inventory, you just cannot have any other food/drink
items ahead of it to get the benefit.  Force feed/drink other food/drink,
and you will continue to get the stat enahancement effect.  Your guildmate
is wrong about how it works.  I cannot answer for what Verant actually
intended.
