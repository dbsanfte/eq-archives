Some other good answers so far, but to expand...

Wizard in the early levels (through the teens and early twenties),
particularly if new characters without the resources to get good gear,
are TERRIBLE soloers. It's a very hard road to take.  But later on when
you can afford better gear and get hold of sow potions / j-boots /
t-boots you can begin to solo better. As mentioned, wizards get Area of
Effect (AoE) spells (e.g. pillar line and circle line) which can hit
four mobs at once. You can single or quad pull mobs and just out run
them and keep hitting them with AoE's.

At level 29 wizards get Bonds of Force, which is an area of effect
snare. Now you can slow down your four mobs and get them in a pack an
control them much easier while you AoE nuke them down. Sadly, the level
29 AoE damage spells are a joke, but at 34 you get Circle of Force,
which is a GREAT quadding tool. From there on out, Wizards can solo with
the best of them.

Of course, when this goes wrong, it goes HORRIBLY wrong, and you have
four very pissed off mobs wanting to chat with you about ruining their
homelands, etc. Also note: Snared wolves are much faster than a snared
wizard. (Yes, I found that out the hard way recently.) Yes, you can
snare yourself if you're not careful. Always have gate memmed while
doing this, and hope your channeling is maxxed.

But when it's working well and you learn your way around with it, it's
awesome. I did ALL of level 36 and two yellows into 37 yesterday just
quadding wolves in GD in a not terribly long play session. Insane xp.
