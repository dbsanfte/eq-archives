I was thinking more of the initial exploration of a top-end zone,
something a bit more informative than a brave or crazy monk/necro/sk.
The intial, pre-spoiler exploration of high-end zones is most likely
impossible without some sort of additional insight.
Hell, even exploring Velious the first two days was tough when nobody
had been in any of the zones before.  I suspect the druid/mage combo
running folks from Great Divide to Cobalt Scar had some inside
information, I was just glad they told me to get a key from the dragon
circle while we were there.
