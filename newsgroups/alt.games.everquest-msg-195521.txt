I refuse to accept the claim that it is just gross negligence. From what 
I've read about the SOE upper management, they don't exactly seem to be 
the forgiving type.

Well, the .DLL scenario was given merely as one example off the top of my

I agree that we owe them nothing - that is except for reasonable 
expectations, which I think are obviously being met, since we are all 
still paying & playing.

are.

I'd hire them in a second, if I could afford them and convince them to 
work for me rather than any of the many other prospective employers they 
would certainly have lined up, that is.

Fact: way too many people that play this wonderful game get way too 
worked up about every little thing that keeps them from playing it every 
minute they would like.
