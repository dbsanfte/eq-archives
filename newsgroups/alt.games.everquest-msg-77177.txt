Okay, sorry I'm this late in responding. I had the same problem until I
figured out what I was doing wrong.

I assume you are trying to format the drive from windows explorer by right
clicking the drive and selecting Format. If you first click on the drive (so
the contents appear on the right side of explorer) you will get the message
that the drive is in use. (It is, it's being viewed in explorer). Just click
on your other drive, then right click the drive you want to format, select
format, and you should be able to format it.

Good luck,
Steve
