I justed wanted to share this with you all because it was a nice gesture
from a high lvl cleric in te end. And a good to day for 2 people.

Me and my companion Bard friend decided to go to Rathe Mountains for some HG
slaying. First we started to solo one but the Bard was beaten up quite badly
and I was running low on mana. I tried to kill him myself but that didn't
work. So a retreat to the zone was inevitable because of our current state.
So we got a group together with a lvl 35 SK and a lvl 36 Necro. That went
very well when we noticed that our good friend came online with his 59 Bard.
We quickly disbanded the group after telling with had to pick someone up
asap. And that was the truth. But they didn't know we were about the return
to RM with our PLer. Hehe.
But first a little side trip to LS for the lambent helm quest for my
companion bard.
After some minor troubles of not entering the zone and be transported to a
safe zone in LS we finally entered the Temple of Sol Ro. So that was one
happy Bard with his new cool looking blue head piece.
Anyway off the RM to get some money and xp so I could ding that evening.
After explaining some things about the charm song, we got started. So pull
after pull was giving us great amounts of plat and for me the neccesary xp.
DING 35!
Ok it was getting late and we decided to drop the happy lambent Bard off in
WC while I ported the big Bard to Iceclad.
Once we arrived there I told him to get the gnome village to get my 34 spell
Fury of Air.
He was away for about a minute when first 1 Snow Dervish started to pound on
me, and then shortly after a second joined him. I didn't really realized
what happend untill I saw LOADING PLEASE WAIT.......
And there I was at Lake Rathe naked as schoolboy whos clothes has been
stolen when he was taking a shower by his o so called 'good' friends.
The Bard came too late to rescue me but he asked in the zone if I could get
a rez of a cleric. Being a well known figure on the server (one of the few
high end bards on Brell), he got a 96% rez from from a 56 cleric(I love ya
babe) at no charge! I was very happy at that moment because I just made
about 140pp off the HGs. And I thought there go my winnings of today. And to
make it even better I got my lvl back.

The end.
