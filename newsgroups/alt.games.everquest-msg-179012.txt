Too open to exploit, sadly. Any mob that can be pulled near a zone line,
or mem-blurred would then be a marshmellow. As you use up HP/mana
resources, you just get people off the hate list, have them sit down for
a few seconds, and BOOM! Full recharged and ready to hop back into
battle.

If you could zone/mem blur your wizards and other nukers off the Hate
list so they could sit down for "seconds", you would increase the DPS of
the raid force exponentially.
