So it looks like she has about $1400 total to spend.....

I assume that niether of you is comfortable building the system from
scratch....

I would suggest she look at ordering a DELL online or over the phone.
(3-year warranty, quality components)

Minimum specs (If you want to comfortably run Luclin, you have to have
at least the following.) ...

CPU: 1.0Ghz (P3 or P4)
Memory: 512mb (PC133 or DDR)
Video: Geforce3 Ti200 64mb DDR (Avoid any Geforce MX cards unless
money is extremely tight. They are good cards, but slower. The
GF3Ti200 is the best bang for the buck right now.)
Sound: Turtle Beach Santa Cruz (avoid the SBLive! for EQ use)
Operating System: (Win98SE, or WinXP...Do NOT get WinME)

My company uses DELL PCs and servers (10 servers, 120 PCs). They have
all been incredibly reliable. We have only lost 2 HDDs and 1 mouse
over the last 3 years.
