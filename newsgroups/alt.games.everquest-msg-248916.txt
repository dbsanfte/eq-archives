    Not to mention hilarious.  I especially like the part where he tells
Richard that he's never been in a high end guild unless he's been ebayed.  

    I don't know if Richard's analysis is on the money or not, since I
never did, nor likely never will, get anywhere near the high end game in EQ
(or any other MMORPG, knowing how I tend to play).  However, this whole "I
disagree with what you say so you are an idiot and a newb" thing that
Michael seems to have going on is particularly ignorant when applied to
Richard.
