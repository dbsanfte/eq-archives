/g Great Heal for %T, Brell's little gift
/cast 2
/pause 3
/cast 2

The pause and recast takes care of fizzle, here,
if I blow a spell I start casting it again, likely
before I even realize I've blown it.  If the spell
goes off successfully, I simply get a message
saying that I cannot perform that action while
casting a spell.

/g Healing %T with the superior power of Brell
/cast 2
/pause 3
/cast 2

/g Rooted the %T, BACK UP

/g There's a %T incoming, I suggest you stand up and GET IT

/corpse

/ooc CAMPING OUT contact Finneous for res
/sit

/g keep me clear 30 seconds if it costs you your life

/loc

/target (name of tank or chanter not in my group)

Hmm, that's all that come to mind, in no particular
order, and with precious little explanation... hopefully
most are self explanitory
