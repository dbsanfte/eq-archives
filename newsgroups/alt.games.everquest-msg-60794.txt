I did forget a footnote; forgive me, but the gist of the footnote's content
should have been that I do have a few IRL friends I group with but it's an
issue of scheduling (I'm an 8-5, M-F type person, they're "weird hours due
to school and odd jobs" type people so while 9:00-1:00AM is anathema to me,
for them it's an even, measured night of gaming).  I don't blame them!  Hell
if *I* had the time to do that, I would!

I'm finding that out more and more.

Maybe I'll give one of those classes a try; I've been playing a paladin
strictly.  Hey, I've been powerleveled/clawed my way up to 7th level now...

Ah.  Thought it was just me.

OK, I was getting most every tidbit of info from Everlore.com, I'll check
out the link you've got there, thanks.

Thanks; I was bracing myself for a lot of "Then fuck off!  Quit playing!
Quit whining!" responses, believe it or not...

Just my Paladin, 7th level (Name's Cinlayen if you're ever in Greater
Faydark, AKA "The Only Place I Don't Die Horribly Except When I Get Within
300 Yards Of An Orc").

I'm probably going to keep having a go at it until the first of the year,
then just let it go if I can't hack it.  This'll be the acid test for
MMORPGs for me...

(I usedta MUD back in the day, so it's not that alien to me...)
