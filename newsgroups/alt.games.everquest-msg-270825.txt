When did HP begin using ASUS MBs?

I see below you said you're getting 1GB. This is a must

Try switching slots and see if it still happens. That is the quick acid
test for me. If it does then I presume it's bad and if I feel like it I'll
run further tests.

You should be able to run the FX5600 at around medium level and be fine (I
have an MSI FX5600 and didn't have any problems with where it set the
defaults. It's still prettier than EQ1 at that level. RAM > GFXCard in EQ2s

From what I understand if you don't have problems with EQ1 on your current
setup you shouldn't have problems with WoW.
