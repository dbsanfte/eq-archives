However, I believe you've overlooked one thing about the 6 melee group.  A
group of 6 casters killing a given mob uses ~1/6th the mana each that they
would use to solo a similar mob, so they recover mana in ~1/6th the solo
time, so have ~1/6th the downtime.  If the downtime is the major limit on
kill rate soloing, rather than the fight time, then the group can kill
almost 6 times faster.  However, they are splitting the XP 6 ways.  They
gain compared to soloing in an XP camp is going to come from the group bonus
and being able to take higher mobs.

With 6 melees, they get an ~1/6th damage taken factor from sharing the
damage, the same way the casters get ~1/6th mana from sharing the
nuking/doting.  However, the melees ALSO get another ~1/6th damage taken
factor because the mob goes down in ~1/6th the time.

So, even if they had no healing, it wouldn't be as bad as you'd think at
first, because they get that extra factor of 6.  More importantly, though,
they do have healing--bandaging!  That's what would make it interesting to
at least try once.  Because Warriors get two factors of 1/6, instead of 1,
in many XP camps, they would be taking so little damage individually that
even if they could only bandage to 50%, they would be safe.

I'm not saying 6 Warriors would be a great XP group.  What I'm saying is
that extra 1/6th factor looks like it might reduce their downtime enough to
make it so they would be an OK group--interesting enough to make it a fun
thing to try.
