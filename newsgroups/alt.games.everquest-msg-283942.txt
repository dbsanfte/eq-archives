Yes, they do, certainly much more so than clerics.  Not only can they 
recover a group/raid from a wipe, they can probably just solo some mobs 
while the rest of the group is busy buffing and getting mana, heck, they 
can drain mana from some of the mobs and give that to the group directly 
for that matter.

I group a lot, I raid a lot, and I solo a lot.  Shaman have it pretty 
good soloing, but are nothing compared to a necro in that regard.
