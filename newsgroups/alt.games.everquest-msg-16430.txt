The problem with grouping is that if you don't know what you're looking for
you end up looking for a group for 15 to 30 minutes. After that you can
usually go on up until you quit the game for that day. I've been in groups
on sunday that had persons rotating in and out for 24 hours straight. And
this was just hunting gnolls outside paw. First I joined a new group at
Saturday night (GMT+1) and played for like 6 hours or so (on of the few
Saturdays I actually could do that) I spent 3 hours in the sundaymorning and
another 5 a lot later in the evening. Some of the persons who joined it just
before I logged were still there when I got back on and confirmed the group
was still rocking.
The "group" was simply rotating through it's members. some people only join
for an hour and others play straight 24 hours (had a person claiming he was
up for 36 hours. not all on eq, but a lot none the less)

Grouping takes as long as you want it to be.
