i installed the beta 2280 drivers, as recommended on eqcastersrealm and it
worked fine. maybe give them a go.
horrible installation though. a poor newb-to-pc eq player would have a tough
time installing these drivers as the instructions arn't quite correct and
you have to tell the op system where to find old files that the driver
installation program could not find. =/
