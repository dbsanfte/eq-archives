/em eyes Blue, in its fancy IndyBag, sitting idly under the bed...

My main work machine used to be a 4-proc RealityEngine2, back in the 
days when 1GB of RAM was a hell of a lot, but I've used pretty much 
every flavor of Silicon Graphics workstation, from the original Indigo 
to the Octane.

I don't know about the server side of things (only logged into our 
Challenges rarely, I was never a sysadmin), but the only machines that 
can give SGIs a run for their money cool-wise are the new Macs. When I 
bought my first Windows PC in '95, it was a definitely underwhelming 
experience, and it hasn't got any better. :)
