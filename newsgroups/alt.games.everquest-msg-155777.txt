I'm told it's just a graphics caching problem.  If you have graphics caching
turned on it doesn't download the textures everytime you zone and uses the
ones stored on the harddrive.  If you delete all the .TXC files from your eq
directory and/or turn of caching it should fix the problem. AFAIK it has
nothing to do with the video card makes/models.
