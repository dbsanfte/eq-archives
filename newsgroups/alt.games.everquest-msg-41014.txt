> Nice observation, but you need to work on your history.

Though I certainly don't agree with any assesment of Austrelians as all bad
(Hey, my favorite Uncle is an adopted Aussie) his history wasn't wrong.
Austrellia was originally populated (other then the indigs) by prisoners who
were dumped there because it was cheap and efficient.
