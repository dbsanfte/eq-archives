The thing is, SOE took something that wasn't broken and broke it in some 
wacky attempt to "modernize" the game. And it's not just PERFORMANCE 
problems that they caused, they also caused a lot of in-game bugs, like 
broken lifts, broken boats, getting stuck, dropping out of the world, ad 
infinitum. Now people who have been going along just fine with an ancient 
game on their ancient PC's are having to choose between upgrading or 
quiting. I chose to quit, at least until such time as I have a new 
computer (bought for some OTHER game that truely uses the new technology 
to good effect).
