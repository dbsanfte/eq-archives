Puller moves slightly past the group on his return...
So long as they never actually reach melee range with the puller (Enchanter
AE stuns before that happens) you can draw agro from as many mobs as there
are in the zone and keep them there until you either zone, die or kill
everything :o)

You never seen someone kite the BroodMother Swarm in NK?... the WHOLE
SWARM!! (Broodmother and about 30+ Broodlings)

Run in... snare momma... draw agro from enough lawntrash to cause screen
lag...
Keep casting Careless Lighning until you run out of little bugs...
Hope nobody has KS'd momma in the meantime...
Root'n'Rot momma

A gem or jewelry worth up to 250pp... soloable from early 30s... was phat
loot while it lasted :o)
