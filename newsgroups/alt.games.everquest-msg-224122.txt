Well.

It seems the the server that we run on had a major HDD failure. It is taking a
replacement of the HDD. I do not know how long this will have us down.

The aditional problem is this. The person working on the server has posted
conflicting information.
At 4pm his time (not sure time zone) he said the all data was lost and
unrecoverable.

At 10pm He said he is working on getting people access to the sites, then he
will see about recovering the data.

If the Data was lost. It could take a bit of time to get us going, with an ETA
of a week to get something basic up.

{Ngreth sits on gnormy for being prophetic}

I never got a chance to make a backup due to permission problems we were having
with the Database. We will have to see what data is recoverable.
