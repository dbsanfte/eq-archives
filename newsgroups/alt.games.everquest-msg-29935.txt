    Actually, the person complaining was the king of complainers, Furor from
Fires of Heaven. This is his perspective:

-all pre-Kunark and Kunark content killed dozens of times over
-ALL Velious zones explored
-ALL "killable" boss mobs killed, value of loot tables determined

    So for him, there's nothing to do until SoL except farm the same mobs,
over and over, for drops. There's nothing to do.
