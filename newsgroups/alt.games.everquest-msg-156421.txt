I saw on the official everquest site that there is a free 30 day trial.

So I downloaded the game and got the "key" but I am unable to play the game.

It said something about billing... so I filled in the billing screen and
there was nothing about a free trial key. So I entered the key in the
"gamepass" or whatever it is called field... and it didn't work.

Does this free trial exist?
How do you use the key?
can anybody help?


I am very excited about trying out EQ.
I have played DAOC but heard that EQ is deeper.
So I am here to give it a whirl... it I can for free.

HELP!
