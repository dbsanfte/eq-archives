Torgiran probably starts around there, there are dark blue mobs in 
Torgiran all the way up to level 65, as you go in deeper.  Nadox tends to 
be a bit higher level than Torgiran.  As I recall, Dulak will take you up 
to 60 or higher, I know the toughest ship is still mostly light blue to 
me at 65.
