Well i was around for most of them... but like Monual, the last few months
found myself playing increasingly less and less (reaching the point about 4
months ago, where I would just log on for raids, and log off at the AE tl).

So its nice to get that itchy feeling again, even though its killing me
grinding at this rate !  It seems kinda odd, that leveling to 70 could be
spaced over the next month, during explorations and spell gatherings, at a
fun pace, but heres us, grinding in the usual zones to get it out of the way
asap, seriously overdoing it, and having nothing to do the next 5 months of
the expansion!
