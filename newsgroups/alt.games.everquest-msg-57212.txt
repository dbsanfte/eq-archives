Depending on the guild and whatever individual crisis it's going through
(aren't *all* guilds continually in some form of crisis or another?)
that can, in fact, be a problem.  When our guild was going through the
whole "uber flight" problem (which we never solved, by the way) there
was a continual push to raise the minimum entry level to 46 and to try
to get groups together to help the lower level folks level faster to get
their mains above 46, and start building some planes capable raiding
parties. But our guild leader never really got it. She, herself, kept
starting alts and playing them, inviting people she met who were as low
as *ten* when her own guild charter on the web site said twenty, etc. 
The reason the high levels wanted these changes was to try to alter our
guild's "rep" on the server to be one of a more high level guild. That
might make it easier to recruit new higher levels who might feel
compelled to change guilds for whatever reason. Also, if we started
making more of a guild force showing in the planes, Seb, Velks, etc.
then people would hopefully get to know us more, and it would be sort of
like free advertising.

Sadly, that never happened, the high levels kept getting siphoned off
into AV, Grey Council, Harmonium, and DO, and the few of us that
remained were not enough of a force to do any guild only expeditions
into the bigger zones. I've basically stopped playing my warrior except
on rare "as needed" occasions for a similar reason. I've been invited
into two of the upper level guilds, and if I decided to go back to
playing Jakugg primarily, I will probably quit mine immediately and sign
on with DO. They aren't doing ToV or anything yet, but at least they
raid SG, the Arena in Keal and such. My current guild still couldn't get
up a sufficient force to get a Jade Reaver out of CoM or likely even
take down the big Freeport militia leader for our paladins yet.
*sigh*
But anyway, yeah, I can see how continually dragging newbies into some
guilds that are not specifically *intended* to be newbie guilds could
be  a problem.
