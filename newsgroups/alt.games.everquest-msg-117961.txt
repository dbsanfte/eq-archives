Pretty simple process actually.  What you need to do is petition the GM to
make them aware of the event.  They may even be willing to send a (preacher)
but they need notice to plan for it.
You can buy your food where ever you want.  For my wedding a (gm/guide)
brought some nice hearty ale and wedding cake (to bad it was no rent).
I liked to offer a piece of advice as well ensure you pick a nice location,
but a location that is suitable for all the guess.  I attended a wedding in
FoB once and one  got to close to the Orcale and then one thing lead to
another and  the oracle wipeout the beach with the exception of the Iksars
the place looked like a warzone.
Hope this information helps.
