That's because it's the same deadbeats that go cable dish network
cable directv cable primestar cable dtv cable etc.
They just float from one to another ducking bills and being asses as
they go : )

The favorite seems to be the "give them a slightly different SS# and
use my middle name instead of first" routine.  Heh, I nailed someone
who had done that last night, his next bill is going to be about
500.00 more than he expects : )

Hawk

I love the sound of nailed deadbeats in the morning.
