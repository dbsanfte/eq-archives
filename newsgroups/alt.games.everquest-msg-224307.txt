Since you can only put 3 points in regen and 3 points in run 3, there
is no conflict for your general points.  I really can't think of any 
other way you would spend those.  I put 3 in run and 3 in int, because,
at the time, my int was so low.  Now it's 275 without buffs and I have
a +6 int augment sitting in the bank waiting for a good reason to put
it in.  I'd rather have those 3 back - but I'm not sure what I'd put them
in.  If I were you I'd put my first 3 in run3 and my 2nd in regen.

As for run 3 vs. SoW (even insta click) - you can't refresh it in a
dungeon.   

Now, an AA point costs the same amount of XP, regardless of your current
level.  That amount is ~15,000,000.  It requires an equivalent number
of the same level mobs in the same zone with the same group to get an
AA point as it does to get from 51 to 52.  (the actual xp number isn't
the same, because of the funky mods put in to smooth the hell levels
out and to make AA's a bit harder than they were at release)

Take a look at the XP info posted below - you'll see that a group of
6x65 hunting level 62 giants in BoT (we were seeing 35 per hour last
time, according to my log parser.  We were spawn limited, with more
to take we would have gone higher) generates tremendously more XP per
hour than a group of 52's hunting level 49 mobs anywhere.

I was getting 62 * 62 * 119 * 2.16 * (70/(360 + 30)) * 2.21 = 363,936
per mob.  This was around 1 aa every 72 minutes.  Observed time was one
every 1 and a quarter hours.  pretty close.

Now, take a group of 6 52's to PoI entrance, where most mobs are low 50's.
Let's take an average of 52 -

52 * 52 * 119 * 2.16 * (57/(312+30)) * 1 = 115,839xp.  It will take over
3 times as many mobs to get an AA - but you are likely killing them at 
about the same pace as the 65's kill level 62 mobs.

Unless those AA's will dramatically help you gain the levels, then you are
often better off going for levels first.  Now, if you're going to be doing
tons of dungeons and you're the puller, run 3 is probably a good investment
prior to leveling again.

------------------------ Start Repost of XP info here ---------------------

The basic formulas for xp go as follows -

Where -
ZEM = Zone Experience Modifier
ML = Mob Level
GB = Group Bonus (1)
HCB = High Con Bonus (2)
N = number of players in group
S = sum of levels in group
PL = player level
B = Base mob xp (3)
XP = Xp awarded to player (4)

(1) For (N=1, GB=1.0; N=2, GB=1.2, N=3, GB=1.4;
    	(N=4, GB=1.6; N=5, GB=1.8; N=6, GB=2.16)

(2) HCB = 1 if ML < 55 or PL < 50 or PL-ML > 5
    else 
    HCB = 1.95 + ((ML - (PL-5)) * .13)

(3) B = ML*ML*ZEM*GB

(4) XP = B * (PL + 5) / (S + (N*5)) * HCB
    	
Empirically this appeared to be true -

While PL'ing in the Hole (ZEM = 100) I saw the
expected XP gain from the PL'ee's with this formula.

----- Start Repost of my (incomplete) info on xp per level----------------

Where 
PL is Player level
M is the modifier (1)
R is the race penalty

XP to get through a level is
PL*PL*PL*1000*M*R

M is the tricky one.
It used to be that
M = 1 for levels 1-24
M = 1.1 for 25-29
M = 1.2 for 30-34
M = 1.3 for 35-39
M = 1.4 for 40-44
M = 1.5 for 45-50

This caused the famous "Hell Level" effect

To get from 24 to 25 the amount of xp needed (for humans) was
(24^3*1000*1.0*1.0) - (23^3*1000*1.0*1.0) or
13,824,000 - 12,167,000 = 1,657,000

But to get from 25 to 26 
(25^3*1000*1.1*1.0) - (24^3*1000*1.0*1.0) or
17,187,500 - 13,824,000 = 3,363,500

Then from 26 to 27
19,333,600 - 17,187,500 = 2,146,100

So, every time the modifier went up, there was a hell level
where you needed to make up the difference in the modifier times
your total xp to that point.

They smoothed this progression out,- the amount of xp to get from an
old hell level to the level just prior to the next one is the same as
it used to be, but it is distributed more evenly so there is no hell
level.  The last level needs more xp than it used to, the hell level
less.  It's probably done with another modifier based on level, but
I don't know the precise mods.
