If you want to put words in my mouth, fine. I'd just prefer they be 
consistent with my views. I don't want any better chance than any other 
member of a pickup group at getting an item. I don't want any worse 
chance either. It's that simple.

Neat. The thing is, you would still have stories. I still join group 
looking for items I would use right off the drop, and I do get them on 
occasion.

Convincing you that you're wrong isn't my objective here. I'm more 
interested in defending my own views than worrying about yours.

"...but that's not a desirable result" is quite a bit different than, 
"...but I don't feel that's a desirable result". You presented it as a 
statement of fact, not opinion. Therefore, you're making claims as to 
what we would all find desirable whether you meant to or not.

I agree that it's a special moment. I truly enjoy it myself. That can 
still happen, and outside of high end raids, it can easily happen more 
often than you let on.

Of course that would be better. However, it's nice to have some loot joy 
between the awesome item gains worthy of song.
