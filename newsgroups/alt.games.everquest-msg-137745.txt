LOL!!  See my sig below. 

Beastlords are one of the BEST solo classes in EQ. Most people just
don't know it yet :-). I have soloed for 99% of my 31 levels, and
others have soloed 1-60.

My guess is that he would be referring to Warriors as the class that
rogues are tied with. Personally I would rank Warriors above Rogues,
assuming that the Warrior is twinked well. Even the best twinked Rogue
is crippled if he fights his battles without backstab.

>is this a level-specific idea? as in, "boo, clerics can't solo past 20!" ?

It's pure game mechanics. A Rogue can't backstab from in front of the
creature they are fighting. Rogues also do not have enough HP or raw
AC to stand to-to-toe with creatures solo once they reach the
mid-levels.
