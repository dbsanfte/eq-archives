Depends on the puller.  I usually grouped with a bard who was great at
pulling singles, but I've also grouped with people in LDoNs who simply
pulled the entire room.  My chanter got serious lessons in mezzing in
LDoNs... it's great practice.  In particular, SRo LDoNs have horrible
targetting, so you have to learn to target with the "next NPC" key, as
mouse click often doesn't work, even when you are standing right in
front of the mob.
