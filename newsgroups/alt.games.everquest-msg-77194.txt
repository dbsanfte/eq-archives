    That's good, because that's exactly what it is. Use your melee attack
key, and you med while in combat. Since two of the three most-affected
classes don't dual wield....

    Much like MoK is. The longer the fight, the better the spell becomes.

that you always want your clerics casting on such mobs, mind you.
