For lamerz who can not read - I clearly stated the above as my OPINION!

Again for the lamerz - I clearly note AMD has MINOR issues on only TWO
applications. In my mind - running almost a dozen pc's in my home and using
both AMD and INTEL on a daily basis I have reasonably stated my issue. I
have even given AMD credit for being faster than my INTEL pc's on MANY
applications.
