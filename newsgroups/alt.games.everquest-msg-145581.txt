Bards have lockpick and remove traps, but capped at such a low level
that they are useless for endgame content... and there is no lower level
content where they are really useful.  Opening up some of the current
"key only" content like TOFS to lockpicking would make rogues and
bards more desirable at lower levels, and yet anyone who wanted to
get around the "need" for a picker would simply have to gather keys,
like you do now.  This is the way Befallen works, gather the three keys
or get a picker... any picker.

Similarly, traps like the ones in Echo are annoying but not play preventing.
Putting in content like that, where you could use a rogue/bard to make
life easier, or work harder to get around, would make the lower end game
more interesting for those who took up the classes with more than looking
at mob butt for 60 levels in mind.
