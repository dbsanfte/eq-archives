It's something implemented with SOL expansion- available for 51 and up.
Explanations are best found in the manual or the SOL guide, but there's
probably something on allakhazam.

In essence, you figure out how much of your XP you want going to AA. And
when you fill up a point's worth of XP (takes about as much to go to 50
to 51), you can figure out what ability to spend your point on.
Naturally, there are limits to what you can do with them. But once you
get six, you get a title. And there's no way to rid yourself of the
title.
