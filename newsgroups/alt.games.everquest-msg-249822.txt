All this talk of value changes reminded me of M:TG.  It's a collectible 
card game, and I think I remember seeing individual cards going for over 
$200 at times.  Recently I heard of another card game company that sells 
individual cards for about $3.  It keeps the price down.  

Maybe that's SOE's plan, give everyone all the loot they want for just a 
little money.  Granted it would probably ruin the game, but it wouldn't be 
as bad as some of the scenarios we have come up with here.
