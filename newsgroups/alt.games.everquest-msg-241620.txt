But are they moving forward the best way?  Consider that EQ graphics engine
upgrades, a couple times now, have required DirectX versions that were
fairly recent--more recent than other MMORPGs required at the time.  Yet,
these upgrades have not put EQ on top graphically, but rather have simply
made them less far behind most of the other MMORPGs.

This indicates that the things that are being changed, and so are requiring
new DirectX versions, aren't the things that most need changing.

They probably would have been better off if, for Luclin, instead of the big
update of their existing engine, they had licensed an engine, and put the
effort that went into Luclin engine work into developing tools to automate
zone and model conversion to the format the new engine wanted.  Good engines
suitable for MMORGPs can be had for $50k initally and $25k/year support
(www.ndl.com, for example).  There's no good reason to have your own engine
if you aren't doing anything better than the licensable engines can do.
