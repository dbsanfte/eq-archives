Here's a new Twist for ya... I met a fellow who was making a kitty
rogue on Mith Marr.. he said it ws gonna be his money maker.. 
He planned to lvl the char and work the pickpocket angle to max skill
and then go to the bazaar and try picking the pockets of the other
'reds'. (He was gonna go red with the char..)
After some discussion in the matter we had the thought that perhaps he
wouldn't be able to pickpocket other PC's in the bazaar possibly. The
Bazaar being a bit of an anomalie as it is.. i.e. no weight limit on
any character etc...
However with the possibility of being levied and 'pushed' to the arena
and then whacked... well who knows.. 
Has anyone else tried this?
