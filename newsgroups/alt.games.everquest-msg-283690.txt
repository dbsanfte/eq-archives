Definitely "old as the hills"... a few months after EQ came out, some
idiot was hassling my wife outside Crushbone.  I just stood right in
front of him and blocked his view.  Bang, next thing I know I'm at the
desktop.  I knew he had hit me with something but the GM I contacted
claimed "oh no, no way he can crash you".  I heard later that it was
via a tell exploit.

I'm really amazed that now (6 years later?) they still have
essentially the same exploit.  This seems like the kind of bug where
you do whatever is necessary to fix it.
