oh bull! as i heard it he was eventually subdued by a teacher and another. I
also heard that he was previously a janitor at another school and that he
had a history of mental illness and depression . He also admitted to
previous suicide attempts that had failed . This is of course one of the
prime diffrences between the countries , the us believes in reforming
criminals while japan believes in punishing them . His suicide attempt will
be sucessfull this time.
