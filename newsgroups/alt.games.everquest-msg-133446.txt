Heh.  I've falsely announced trains more times than I'd like to think of. 
Usually while in North Freeport or West Karana or someplace equally stupid. 
Then I get annoyed and take it out of my hotkey bank, and forget that I've done
it until I'm in a dungeon somewhere with half a million pissed off little
buddies, running desperately and not even being able to find the original
social.  So yes, if you were ever trained on FV or Drinal by some gray-haired
stupid elf chances are good you've seen my talent in action.

Several others played on Drinal, highest is a level 30 Ranger.
