This was discussed a bit before but does anyone have
any stats on how likely it is to work, or anything
that influences its odds of working?

500 mana plus a 13pp rock to take someone
from death to completely healed... doesn't sound
like a bad deal at all.

Cast it to test, and got two successes in a row,
me and my druid friend tanked an old wurm to
death, allowing it to "kill" us each in turn.  I'd
never have expected anything close to this
with Death Pact, which seemed to work
about 20% of the time at best.  Two successes..
that hints at at least a 50% success rate.
