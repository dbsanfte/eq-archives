I own 2 Solists wands, and tried to sell one of them a while ago.
You'll never get that much for it, people arent willing to pay what
its worth because its so low damage.

On the other hand, in a level 12 (when it first works) Wizard's hands,
this wand is just GODLY.  Make a wizard twink and play with the wand
its a lot of fun.  Wizards dont get much opportunity for fun in lower
levels so this wand adds a nice dimension, I think every wiz should
get one at birth =)

So rather than settling for some pittance for this awesome item one is
sitting in my bank vault and the other is out on load to a guildmate.
If anyone on AyoRo wants one badly enough to pay me whats its worth,
send a tell to Kadath.
