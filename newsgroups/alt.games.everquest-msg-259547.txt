i don't have time to read all the posts, so if someone said this already
then don't read this post....

what i do on my hotbutton is put /assist in the first line, then in the next
line put /attack off.  that doesn't always get it, though (something about
more than one command happening to close together), so i just put a second
/attack off in the third line (i think you can also put like a delay or
something between comands, but i don't know how to do it.  anyway, this way
works fine for turning off auto attack)
