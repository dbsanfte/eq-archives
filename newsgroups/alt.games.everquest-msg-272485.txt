I think you're missing the point of the question though.

Its not enough to tell me that an orange mob in EQ2 is one 3-5 levels 
above mine, and that yellow mobs in EQ1 are 1-2 levels above mine, 
because EQ1 and EQ2 are not the same in so many ways; the question being 
  asked here is  more "whats it like to kill orange mobs": if you get 
exp per kill on a par with that provided by light blue mobs in EQ1, then 
thats what its like.  If you get exp on a par with killing low reds (you 
know, the ones that are 3-5 levels above your own) then -that- is what 
its like.

In EQ1, killing light blue mobs was a way to drudge thru levels, very 
slowly, but anyone could do it if they could put up with the tedium. 
However, many classes could mow thru dark blues, whites, yellows, almost 
as quickly as the unlucky stiffs going thru the light blues, and make 
exp pretty quickly.

Even more interesting than attempting to compare EQ1 to EQ2 in this 
regard would be comparing grouping progress to solo progress.  Again, in 
EQ1, soloing for many classes meant drudging thru relatively easy mobs 
or eating large amounts of down time between mobs, while groups could 
mow thru harder mobs, faster, with less down time, making each member 
far more exp per hour even before the grouping exp boost.  But a few 
classes could solo almost as fast as a group, and NOT split the exp, a 
couple (ok, I'm thinking Bard) could even get exp faster than the best 
group, killing mobs by the dozen with no down time at all and splitting 
the exp with nobody.

If EQ2 soloing is, for all classes, like that first case in EQ1, where 
you take 4 times as long to level as your identical buddy who got in a 
group, then its not very solo friendly.  If its similar to the latter 
case, where you level 4 times as fast as your grouped buddies, then its 
VERY solo friendly.  In my opinion, EQ1 was very solo friendly for some 
classes up to the grouping exp change, and even after this change it was 
still reasonably friendly, again for SOME classes.  For others, it could 
really be abyssymal to solo instead of group if you wanted to progress.

As an aside, I've been playing AO a good deal recently, and thus far it 
certainly permits soloing, but grouping is faster exp, on the other 
hand, soloing can be much better loot; since your progress is marked 
almost as much by your gear as it is by your level, its difficult to say 
which is really favored.
