Greetings All.


     Due to a recent move to Austin from NYC, and certain obvious
events of national importance, I haven't been able to play EQ for
going on two months.

     Logged in my character a couple of days ago... finished off the
last blue bub of 40 and now I have NO idea what to do!!

     Most of my good friends are now well beyond me, or have quit.

     And..... I can't quite remember what I was planning to do in
Vellious.

     Aye.... consider me a Ranger with Amnesia and all that rot....
quite...

     Any interesting ideas as to what sort of trouble, intrigue, or
adventure I can stir up?
