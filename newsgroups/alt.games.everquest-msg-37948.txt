Your point is certainly valid, but it seems that the skill ups in EQ are
more clumpy.  For example, 100 attempts and then 2 skill ups in a row seems
to happen more than it should.

I have heard a theory that the EQ servers only generate a new random number
once every tick.  If that's the case, it would explain how you would get
these successful clumps. As long as you can do the iterations within the 6
second window, you would be using the same random number.  So a good random
number would mean success for each combine during that tick.

Another bit of evidence I heard was from someone who tried to figure out
fizzle percentages.  I can't remember the exact numbers, but the jist will
hopefully be correct.  He found the chance of an initial fizzle was like 5%.
But if he got a fizzle, the chance that the next cast would also be a fizzle
was huge.  Like 50%.  So if he got an initial fizzle, he had a 1 in 2 chance
that the next cast would also be a fizzle.  The chance of getting a 3rd
fizzle in a row was also big (something like 30%).  The chance of a 4th, 5th
and 6th fizzles were lower respectively. One interesting thing was the
chance of the next cast after getting 5 fizzles was higher than the chance
of getting the first fizzle.  This also leads me to believe the random
numbers are not computed on each attempt.  There is a memory with regard to
fizzles.  In tradeskills it's harder to tell because it takes so much longer
to make an item that you can't get more than 1 or 2 in a 6 second window.

And a bit of my own evidence with tradeskills.  I've noticed that when
making something very trivial and I get a failure, there is a good chance
the next one will also be a failure.  Now when I get a failure, I stop for
about 6 seconds and continue.  I have not had 2 failures in a row since I
started doing that. I haven't done any calculations so take that with a
grain of salt.
