Alt-d

And I've been using locs for, gawd, coming close to 4 years now!!!  How time
flies.  I'm better at locs than pretty much anyone I know, but it still
confuses me sometimes.  That's why MY /loc button has /doability 1 (SH is
always ability 1 on all my chars) on it...because locs are all very well &
good, but I also don't want to have to re-remember the loc system ever 10
seconds. <g>
