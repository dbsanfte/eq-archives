I am in the same boat as your friend..I have made  many characters from
55-64 now and about 300ish aa's combined..but never really stuck around to
get into the whole guild raid thing..see uber mobs ZeRg the Emp...or so many
other "fun" things i hear about...Why because I am happy being on my own. I
still chat in /guild or serverwide.<insertclass>:<insertclass>..So its not
that im anti social..I just favor being able to call my own shots be able to
log whenever I want without feeling like I letting the group down. Most pick
up groups I do get in turns into a dick waving contest...link this..link
that mines better this sucks ect...gets old real fast...I will say when you
do find that perfect group..its like hitting the lottery...so maybe this is
a blessing in disguise for me..maybe more soloist like myself sharing the
same interests will group more so we can cackle at the loot sluts together
