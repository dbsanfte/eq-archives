At a guess, 50th but it may be 45th I can't see it being any lower.

Sorry to hear that you have lost out on a trade like that but it was long
over due (Doljonijiarnimorinar will be next, I imagine) for a nerf. Although
I think they hit it a bit hard with that ol' bat. There are better dam/del
weapons than 11/24 available for less to put a level limit on it...guess
they don't have the 10AC as well was Verants reasoning for sticking a level
restriction on it.

Hehe, I may be buying one now the price will drop.

Can anyone shed some light on the name Doljonijianimorinar? broken down Dol
Johnny Gianni Morinar, Verant employees names or something?
