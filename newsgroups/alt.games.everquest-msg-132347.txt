I highly doubt Kermit will be slipping on an extra thick condom and
buggering Big Bird while cleaning his shooting up needle, in an effort
to show how to stop the spread of aids.

No doubt the 'lesson' Sesame Street will be 'teaching' is one of
tolerance towards HiV+ people. And those HiV+ people could VERY easily
be part of your community, and could easily be part of your child's
kindergarten. 

When I was in pre-school, there was a kid having chemo. He was bald and
looked funny because of it. We were gently taught why, and that it
wasn't something we could 'catch', despite not really needing to know
about cancer at that age. 

Teaching kids that people with aids aren't highly contagious outcasts
doesn't necessitate going into the gory details. I fail to see how
encouraging tolerance in society can be viewed as a 'bad thing' <tm> at
any age.

IMO, the main (probably subconcious) issue here is that AIDS is viewed
(falsely) as a homosexual/junkie curse, and people don't want their kids
coming into contact with it because they don't want their kids to be gay
or addicted to drugs. The anti-drugs stance is easy to understand, but
the anti-gay side, in my experience, is because the US is predominately
institutionally homophobic. Ironically, people they know who are gay are
fine, but it's not something they'd want their kids doing, and calling
someone or something 'gay' is a general derogatory term.

I do agree that's far too much 'political correctness' for the sake of
it in some sectors of today's society, but I think this particular
decision is on track.
