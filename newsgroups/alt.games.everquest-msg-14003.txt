Before the patch, large sewing kits weight 0.4 (0.3?) and 8-slot.
Post-patch, they weighed 3.0. This patch affected all lg sewing kits,
including ones in player inventories (which resulted in a lot of
suddenly encumbered players).

For a while after this patch, lg sewing kits had their slots increased
to 10. Again, players magicly found all their 8-slot packs had 10 now,
and all the lg ones on merchants had 10 now, too. Another patch after
this change changed ONLY the ones on merchants back to 8-slots (the
increase in slots was damaging the market for player made backpacks,
which were the most easily accessable 10 giant slot bags before
this)...BUT, the lg sewing kits already in player inventories magicly
became "Deluxe sewing kits" so players wouldn't find items overflowing
or poofing out of slots that didn't exist anymore.

So...it is impossible that you would currently have a 10-slot LARGE
sewing kit...
