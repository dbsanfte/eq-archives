Texture performance is directly related to on-board memory and texture size,
although poor coding can result in "texture thrashing" which can also lower
framerates.  The old textures were 32x32 or 64x64 (with the odd 128x128).
The new ones are obviously at least 256x256+.  Because of this a card with
16meg video-RAM is going to suffer more than one with 64meg because the card
needs to poll for the textures.  But there are still obvious slow-downs that
aren't texture related - that's for sure.

I don't think you understand what mip-mapping is.  Essentially you take a
texture and scale it down by a factor of two multiple times.  For example a
256x256 texture in Half-Life will have three additional textures of 128x128,
64x64 and 32x32.  The card doesn't do this for you (at least it doesn't in
OpenGL 1.3 or DX 8.0), you have to provide these textures as mip-map
textures in a call.  What the card will do for you though is utilize the
appropriate mip-map texture when it comes time to render.  It means that
with mip-mapping on you have at least 1 or 2 EXTRA textures to load into
video-RAM for the API to use.  This is why mip-mapping is expensive
load-wise.  I do not understand, however, why Verant is saying their
mip-mapping is a quality feature; it's the exact opposite.  Rendering a
32x32 texture that's way off in the distance is much more efficient than
rendering it at 256x256.

I honestly believe that Verant didn't tweak the core engine much.  The
reason that it worked so well before was that everything was very low poly
and the texture sizes were small.  If you've ever done 3d development you'd
notice that you can easily take huge frame hits by doing two things at once:
increase the poly-count and increase the texture size.  To counter this in a
large world, you need a good LOD and frustrum culling system -- and I don't
think EQ has it which is why the game is busting at the cracks.  But I agree
something is fishy with the new engine because their poly culling system
almost looks bugged in many areas.  You can be out in the middle of nowhere
and simply turn towards a known populated area and get a frame-rate hit.

I think Verant's engine was a mess since day 1 -- in fact the whole game
was.  Now that they're successful, redoing it just wouldn't be worth it.
That time would be better spent on Planetside and Stars Wars.
