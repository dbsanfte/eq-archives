Well, that is pretty easy then...leaving aside the morass of faction that
is velious, you are kos in:

All of neriak
All of grobb
All of oggok
All of cabilis
All of paineel
All of the Overthere outpost

Probably KOS in the mines of malfunction (necro and evil worshipping cleric
gnome area).

Probably KOS in the necro/sk guild spots of freeport and qeynos...I've
never been there with any character, but they would tend to take a dim view
of mith marr worshippers...only being a warrior will probably temper this
somewhat (a paladin who worships mith marr from freeport would be worse
off).

All other "not-so-good" spots like rogue guilds and highpass/hold will not
like you, maybe even to the point where their merchants will not deal with
you, but you would be able to go there without getting your throat ripped
out.
