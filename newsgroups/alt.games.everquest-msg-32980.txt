    Good luck on the eggs! I got lucky at this part - I went to EW, solo, to
try and stumble across griffons myself. I was there just long enough to get
two Manticore Manes when a 50-odd ranger helping a friend track griffons
sent a tell asking for a res. You'll never guess what my price was for the
res. ;-) The ranger believed that snow bunnies were on the same spawn table
as the griffs, if that helps.

    As for trackability, I'd prefer this. I have no idea what Verant thinks
a person SHOULD do to find this spawn point - did they want us running
around for hours at random, hoping to trip the right spawn by "wandering
around the area a lot"? Did they intend for us to use pets to find invisible
spawn points, then use a trick of the trade system to figure out what spawn
it is?

    Make it trackable, change the text for when you find the dwarf to "You
have stumbled...." so the spawn points can't be told apart, and it becomes a
far more realistic quest. I can imagine being with a tracker, trying to find
this poor lost dwarf, and possibly being jumped during the search. I can't
imagine being with a mage with a lump of earth pointing the way, then saying
"My Ethereal Mist Pants say the dwarf isn't over there - it's an ambush!"
