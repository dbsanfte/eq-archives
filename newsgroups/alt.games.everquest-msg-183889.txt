The best thing you can probably do is suicide down to 60.

It will turn several levels back from green/light blue to full blue, and
remove a penatly for attacking "low level full blues".

Lock your exp down one kill away from 61, and re-ding after you upgrade.
The 30% towards 62 that you'll be losing really isn't that much, once you're
hunting in PoP lands.
