I know you did not ask for that but if you have 510 points in Miragul
you could purchase the chilling orb of dark sight which fits in type 7
slots. Or you should go a bit further with the oow augments and try to
get something with plainsight at least. Which would be

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=33174.

Just because I find ultravision a bit of a waste for an augment slot. :)

P.S.: Since EQTraders Corner doesn't come up with a menu I can't give
