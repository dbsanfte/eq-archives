Ooh, ahh.  Now imagine how it's gonna be the first time there's a bug with 
the port stones. :)

Maybe for you, there wasn't.  For me there was.  Even at level 50ish I 
still managed to discover things in WK that could kill me.  I still 
managed to discover ultra-rare mobs that I didn't previously know existed, 
for quests that didn't provide rewards I needed anymore, true, but they 
still added flavor.

}>Remember back when the docks were full and it was a thrill if some 
}>condescending wizard or druid will give you a free teleport?
}No, I remember the Druid/Wizard rings being full, and players leveling
}up port mules to whore for plat.

There were times when the docks were full too.  There were times when, if 
one took the boats, one would have shipmates to while away the time with.  
There was a time when travel was a way to meet people, as much as, or 
sometimes even more so than hunting.  EQ is very social, and there was a 
huge social impact to travel, and to meeting the level 45 
butt-naked warrior who had to take the boats just like you, and passing 
the time talking about his experiences in the game.  If he was terribly 
lucky, perhaps he could convince me to bind him when we got to freeport. 
:) 

}>Norrath is losing its fill of vastness with all this easy travel. 
}Norrath still has a "feel" of vastness. The ability to port between
}the major cities opens up many more zones for newbies to explore and
}hunt in. Yes, travel is trivial now, but you gain the ability to hunt
}in many more places. Especially if you are a casual player with only a
}couple of hours to play. 

Whether it has a "feel" of vstness or not is entirely subjective.  In some 
ways it -is- bigger than ever before.  But in other ways, it has shrunk 
considerably.  It's about like how the invention of the telephone or the 
telegraph, or the horseless carriage shrank the world of our recent 
ancestors.  Sure, it was hard for a casual player to level up, but 
leveling up is not the onlyreason to play this game.

}>Remember back when you were a low-level individual and you had to work your way from 
}>Freeport, through the dreaded haunted Kithikor woods at night then 
}>through Riverdale and then risk your life with a run through Runnyeye?  
}1. Leave Freeport....
}2. Follow zone wall through East Commonlands...
}3. Follow zone wall through West Commonlands...
}4. Wait at Kithicor zone line until 8am (tedious like waiting for a
}boat)
}5. Follow zone wall to Rivervale or High Pass..
}The first couple of times can be new and exciting. After that it is
}simply tedious.

So get a freaking bind.  Figure out where you want to be, and stay a 
while.  Personally, in the real world, I travel from my home in California 
to Chicago more or less annually.  So far, I've taken the train, flown, 
and driven.  And it was an adventure every time.  But I'm not whining 
about how I can't get back to California in two clicks of a mouse, even if 
I did accidentally lock a stray cat in the house who shat on everything I 
owned.  Even if my home was nearly destroyed by the river in the backyard 
flooding, it was still reasonable that it took me three days to get back 
there.

}>Norrath was BIG back then.  Travel was time-consuming.  It made things 
}>more realistic.  It added challenge to the game. 
}Norrath is bigger now than it was then. Players have many more hunting
}options now. Travel pre-Luclin/PoP was tedious and time-wasting. It
}added a timesink to the game, not a challenge. 

False dichotomy.  Not all non-challenges are timesinks, only the boring 
non-challenges.  Travel was only tedious if you let it be.  And old style 
travel now would only be tedious because you're the only one doing it.

}>Things are getting way to easy.  Remember back when the Feerot was 
}>soooo far away from the rest of civilization?  Not anymore, its just 
}>10sec away from any major city in the world.  I am not happy with this 
}>tomes AT ALL !
}Then don't use them. It is as simple as that.

You're the what, 8th person to offer this sage gem of advice?  But it 
completely misses the point.  It is -not- as simple as that.  What's 
missing is not just me merrily riding the boat (which, yes, I still do 
from time to time.  You have to get to the Fay raid somehow. :) ) It's the 
whole socialness of actually meeting people on the way.  And that simply 
doesn't happen if everyone else takes the PoP stones.

}>Well, now that they have the tomes installed I guess they might as well 
}>yank the boats from the game.
}They hardly ever worked right. Hardly anyone would miss them.

I would.  Yes, buggy and slow.  But I would miss them.  So would a lot of 
Bards and Druids who suddenly were unable to complete their epics.

}>I think it was a good thing for people to 
}>wait for the boats and endure the lengthy boat rides.  It promoted more 
}>a feeling of "you are there" and made one appreciate the length of the 
}>journey one was taking.
}It promoted a feeling of "you are sitting in front of a PC staring at
}a monitor". 

If you choose to sit and stare at the monitor instead of interacting with 
the environment you find yourself in on your travels, whose fault isthat, 
really?

}>-- one saddened EQ lover.
}No one is forcing you to use the books. Go ahead...ride the boats and

Again, that completely misses the point.

Well, I've prattled on enough.  Haven't posted in a while, heh.  But it's
