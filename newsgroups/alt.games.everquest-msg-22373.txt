Actually it might overwrite sow, but it previously was
overwriting wolf form too, and I was in wolfform when it
didn't.  I had to remove wolf form, and then cast it.
I tend to use treeform alot, as I am still learning the
timing on using my DoT's while in a group.  Also if I am the
only healer, i will use it to save mana after a fight.
