Best to spend the points on skills that you get after level 1, as many, if 
not all, of them require you to put one point in them in order for them to 
increase from use.  I have many many points unspent at this point, as there 
is just not that much to spend them on.  Handy if you suddenly decide you 
need to power level some lagging skill.
