Hi Linda:

You're in luck being a Druid: You, like me prefer to solo, (I'm a Wizard) so
simply port yourself over to Steamfont Mountains and solo the Clockwork
Cargo located near the entry to Ak'Anon. You'll be through 35 and at 40 in
pretty much no time at all, the spawn time is eight minutes, no loot that's
worthwhile, no bad faction hits of any note, but the experience gain has to
make this a very worthwhile camp for quick level gain. One word of advice
though, don't let the Cargo get too far ahead of you (don't use SoW)
otherwise is gates back to its spawn position and that, in turn, sets off
the casting guy that stands near the Cargo. Also, be sure not to pull it
anywhere the Guards either.

See you at 40 soon .. enjoy .. and safe hunting ..

Regards,

Stevie.
