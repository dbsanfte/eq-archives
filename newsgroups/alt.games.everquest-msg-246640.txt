One game....

And, yes, there was a driver version for NVidia that had problems with
EQ. (probably a couple others here and there) It was replaced within a
week. Of course, ATI users tend to scream at software developers
rather than admitting that ATI could be the source of the flaw... I've
found ATI is the Mac of PC video cards. Its fans are so
single-mindedly rabid that they refuse to admit the hardware is the
problem whenever something goes wrong, instead blaming it on the third
party software or even the user.

By the way, Google is funky. The string you plopped in would turn up
any page or post with those words in it, in any order and separated by
any part. Could be a 10k word document with each word in once every
1000 words and still come back on that Google search...so, it's pretty
much meaningless just to look at the number of hits.
