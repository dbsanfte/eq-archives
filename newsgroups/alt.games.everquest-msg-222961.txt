I use the same method, once I know which row the trader is in, I move off 
to one side, then the other, and determine which side he is on by right 
clicking, then head halfway down or so, and rightclick again.  Have only 
ever had trouble finding traders that are lagging out so bad they are 
invisible, or that are up on top of the dividing wall in the stalls or 
such.
