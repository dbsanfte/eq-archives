It uses a lot of mana, I started quad kiting snow cougars at 34, and could 
(just) get away with it, but I had about 200 WIS then and I also had my 
warden symbol of Tunare, so I could split them up with mana-free roots if 
they weren't quite dead (then they'll run at low health when root breaks, 
they'll keep chasing you if their buddies are nearby).

At 170 WIS I would wait until 36 or so before attempting it.

Lightning strike is more efficient than your other nukes because it hits 
multiple mobs, but if you just consider flat out nuking one mob it probably 
uses half as much mana again as your regular nukes on a damage per point of 
mana basis. A good rule of thumb therefore is that if you can kill 1 mob 
with about 2 thirds of your mana just from chucking firestrike at it, or 
whatever it is at that level, you can probably take out 4 of that mob with 
lightning strike using a full bar of mana.
