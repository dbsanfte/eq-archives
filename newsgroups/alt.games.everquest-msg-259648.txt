Will do. Cable is now in, and both IPs are up and running. I'll run some 
tests once I have things properly configured for A/B testing. I have some 
public DNS records to update to ensure that my incoming mail continues to be 
captured (I think I can do this just by creating a new Host record for the 
cable IP and adding that new Host as a lower priority mail server to my MX 
record, so that when the server switches to a cable connection, mail routing 
to the DSL IP will fail and rollover to the cable IP, and then when the 
server is back on the DSL IP it will receive mail based on the higher 
priority. Appreciate any suggestions from any DNS gurus out there).
