You can download non essentially stuff like the voice packs in the
background. Just go to download options and click the voice pack but
unclick the 'Download immediately option.

Sounds like you have connections problems the updater doesn't auto
cancel. Take it from me, someone who accidentally download the whole of
EQ2 in one 7hour download session!!
