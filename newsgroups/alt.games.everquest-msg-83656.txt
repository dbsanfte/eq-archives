Dunno where you got these ideas from, from what I posted, especially if you
actually *read* the entire thread, but here's my answer, for whatever its
worth. I am *not* threatened by non english speaking
peoples!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All I wanted to know was why the heck they
would post to an english speaking group if they pretty much KNEW they
wouldn't be answered. Is that such a difficult concept, moron? If it is,
please go directly to alt.teddybears.com.

And give me a break by going away.

Oh, nevermind, I have a handy thing called a killfile!
