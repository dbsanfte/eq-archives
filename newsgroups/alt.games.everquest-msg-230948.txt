What incredible amazing idiot thought of this one?

Pickpocket is the Worst skill rogues have, since its designed in such a 
way that your party can't see it happening, and can be used to "skim" an 
unnoticable part of the cash loot off every mob.

Doesn't create new cash, just redistributes it into the hands of the 
unscrupulous rogue.

Why is this bad?  Well from a RP standpoint, its not really.  But from a 
practical standpoint, it means that rogues get overlooked for grouping 
purposes far more often than their abilities would indicate.

An AA that -requires- them to pickpocket in order to do their job well 
(that is to say, to do damage)?  Madness!

Personally, I'm happy to have rogues in the party, make them 
masterlooters, because after all, any master looter already has the 
opportunity to skim all he wants, might as well not have someone else do 
it and double your chances of someone stealing party cash... plus I 
figure being trusted actually increases the chances of someone being 
trustworthy.

Still, this strikes me as a very poor idea.

Splendid
