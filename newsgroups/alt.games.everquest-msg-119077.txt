Using the Centi SS in the off hand right now.

And I'd love to be swinging some Lammys right now, but it's getting to
the point where I can see why aggro is a Bad Thing for rangers.  I was
playing MA in a Dreadlands group yesterday and raging and ravishing
drolvargs where beating the hell out of me and making our druid healer
work overtime.  I can only imagine how bad it's going to get in other
places.

Base dam/del ratio, the Wurmy is BETTER than the Lammy though.  With
the damage bonus, the Lammy doesn't beat the Wurmy till 50ish, from my
understanding.

Venomous Axe sounds like a nice off hander actually.

I got a Yheshka Warclub if I wanna do that.  It's 9/24 with a 75point
DD.  I *LIKE* 1hs weapons though.  And my experience is that if you
come to depend on a weapons proc, you are going to find yourself
generally disappointed.

I've managed to keep 1hs, 1hb and 2hs up.  My piercing is not good.
And we won't discuss 2hb.
