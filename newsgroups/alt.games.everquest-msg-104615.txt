Christ. My regular play partner (snookie ;-) ) is a 60 druid and oh-my-god.

Ok, so we're out the wazoo with AAXP now, maxed healing gift and spell casting
fury 2 not to mention other niftiness's like Exodus, but to claim druids are
useless in the end game and lose grouping power because they solo well?

Bwa. Ha. Ha. Ha. Haaaaaaaaa.

As a 60 ranger/druid duo we form the basis of all our groups. I am regularly
tank, Perl is regularly prime healer, we have no problems. And when we have a
*proper* healer and that mana is free to do more interesting flexible
useful things.... 

Gawd. So we dont have CH and defensive. Bite me. Are you telling me you need
CH and defensive for XP grouping?

Sui (No ben, I know *you're* not, but geez, the druids who are....)
