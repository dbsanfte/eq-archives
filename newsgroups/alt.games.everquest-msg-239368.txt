The *named* have capital letters in LDON:  a Bludgeoning Burnout Badboy - so: 
a Bludgeoning burnout badboy is not a named.
I usually track between pulls or during healing, but my tracking doesn't *fill*
my screen, it's on the far left side.  The cleric will gladly wait until after
the battle.  
When I track in LDON I face the direction the named is in.  Then I say *the BBB
is the direction I am facing which is directly NW*.  
Solves the problem.
