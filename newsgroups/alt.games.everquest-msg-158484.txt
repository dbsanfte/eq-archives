It's better as an upgrade to Superior Healing than Remedy.  Remedy
casts faster, good for saving the dress-wearers IF someone can get
the mob's attention pretty quickly or IF the mob can be mezzed.

That depends on the mobs you're fighting and your mana requirements.
Figure DA, CHeal, Celestial Healing, and either Remedy or Divine
Light will always be up.  That leaves four slots.  It's nice to
have a Root-line spell available for ghetto crowd-control if you
need it.  The other three are then available for Stuns if some of
the mobs can cast Gate (load three and chain-stun.)  Or, against
undead mobs, you can load anti-undead spells (your best Nuke and a
DoT) and at least one Stun (for stopping a mob long enough to get
a Root off.)  Or, outside, a nuke and a Fear-line spell (another
ghetto form of crowd control.)  And, depending on where and how
you play, Gate's nice to have up too.
