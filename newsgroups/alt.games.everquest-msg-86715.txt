No choice: we get Bertoxx

I think it comes from the fact that gnomes are a "generally" good race. I
could bank in Kelethin and Felwithe, but couldn't buy or sell anything.
Found out the hard way I was KOS to Kaladim (crossroads). I started dubious
to North Freeport, didn't care about selling anything as long as I could use
the bank. I started apprehensive to WFP/EFP, as well as Neriak, so I could
buy and sell at either one.

You can also go to the DE outpost in Overthere, which amazed my friends for
some reason. It was the first time they saw the dragoons and giant muddite
guard up close.
