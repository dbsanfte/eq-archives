I think this really comes down to where you started your druid at.  I
can see how if you started in the Ewok village or Rivervale, you would
see yourself as a priest of your people.  But I started Bogart in
Surefall.  My example of how to be a druid is the long lamented Cros

Like I said, I understand that game mechanics is a whole 'nother thing
that RP, but I still feel that druids should be the offensive priest
class.  But that's just me.
