My big love is Resist Magic, because it is hard to get up for a monk. I can 
take a nuke or a dot- it's roots, charms, and slows that frighten me.

Yeah, I had a Goranga for a good long time. It might be time to revisit 
that idea.

I am on Drinal, and they get spendy there too (although the economy is not 
as insane as some of the others I hear about)

Wow, that's pretty cool.. Thanks for the heads up.

Ugh and ugh.

The head will have to wait I think.

I had a Peacebringer for a while, sold it to finance the stun batons I have 
now.

Tstaff is high on my list of things to pick up- I've wanted one for a long 
time. First, though, I think I will get an Entwood Mace and leave the 
Adamantite Club in offhand.

Neither really, I am not familiar with the bloodmetals...

Those are some damn fine earrings, come to look at it. They get to wait a 
while too though as I don't recall seeing them on Drinal.
