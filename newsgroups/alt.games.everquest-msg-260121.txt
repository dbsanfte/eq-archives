That says more about bards than rangers though. <g> I can't think of
very many situations where I wouldn't take a bard to round out any
group.

In the context of LDoN (normal and hard), which is about the only time
i worry about filling up a group, Ranger is always at the top of my
list of classes to recruit if the basics are covered. For a normal
LDoN, they bring more to the table than almost any class; DPS,
offtanking, snap-agro, tracking, snare, crowd control. For a hard
LDoN, tracking and 'good enuf' DPS is all they need to make them a
worthwhile addition to a group.  

Admittedly, there's other classes that can fill a DPS slot (and do
better DPS) but I still prefer the utility of a ranger. The second
class I'll look for to fill a DPS slot is a necro, for basically the
same reasons.
