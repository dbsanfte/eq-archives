Cast a spell of known mana cost over and over until oom.  Preferably a
relatively low mana cost so that you can tell that you are really oom.  Make
sure you know exactly how long it took, and add back in your standing mana
regen rate, 1 mana per tick unless you have anything enhancing mana
regeneration.  Best to do this prior to specialization, as that will affect
mana usage.

Take your Necro with 210 int, and, standing the whole time, cast say minor
shielding over and over.  2.5 seconds per cast, 10 mana per cast.  With 210
int at level 13, you should have 604 mana.  You should be able to cast it 62
time and have 9 mana left, so likely what with human reactions, lag and
such, 63 to 65 times at a guess.  If you can cast it noticably more or less
times than that, then there is probably an issue with the calculation.
Another way you might try, is strip off 10 int, cast till as close to
completely oom as possible (cast locate corpse until you can't, you will
have less than 5 mana left at that point), put your 10 int back on, cast
Gate (70 mana), Engulfing Darkness (60 mana),  Scent of Dusk (50 mana).  I
would expect you to be unable to cast Gate, possibly be able to cast
Engulfing Darkness, definately be able to cast Scent of Dusk, assuming that
this calculation is correct.  Repeat this test in a few levels, and see if
it has changed.
