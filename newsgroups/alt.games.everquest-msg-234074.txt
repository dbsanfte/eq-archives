But as you get higher level, you're handling more mana "in your head",
which does make you more powerful. You're also handling more powerful
spells "in your head". The D&D analogy isn't going to cut it, sorry.
If anything, EQ casters have it BETTER than D&D casters (Or do you
want to start giving spells absurdly easy to hit saving throws? >< ).
