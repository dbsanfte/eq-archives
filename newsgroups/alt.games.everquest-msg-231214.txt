I have lurked here for many years, posting occasionaly, and reading
daily. There has been some great posts.

Like Lance talking about his Mage (I love his name, Splendid One). He
has leveled FAST!

Ben Sisson and his "hold no punches" style.

Darktyger getting asked to cite (I think you guys are too tuff on him,
as a matter of fact. He seems to be held to higher standard than the
rest).

Jennaii, Lokari, Sean Kennedy, 42, Graeme, et all. Have been fun to
read.

And of course Richard Lawson. How I lived the high end game through
Monuals' eyes. I never made it past the Teir 1 planes. But with Monual
I went from LOIO to Time. It was quite a ride!

Anyway, I had some very good fortune in my life. My son, whom I havent
seen in many years is luckily back in my life (Why do I tell
strangers? I don't know. I guess I want to share my good fortune). So
I decided I needed to quit EQ to concentrate on him. Which brings me
to my post...........

Instead of just quiting and deleteing my gear, I decided to go out
with style! So NYCHMSIGIA *No you cant have my stuff I gave it away*
So here is what I did....

I went to GFAY (one of my all time favorite zones) and /OOC'd that I
was giving my stuff away, and to /join bonam for a trivia contest for
each peice of gear. Bonam had at least 100k worth of gear on him, or
what I paid for it anyway :)

Well, the trivia contest was a blast. Though the Beatles questions
were met with crickets from the younger players :) But more
importantly, the well wishes of my fellow EQ players that I constantly
recieved. It made me understand how much I would miss my EQ family.

It also made me understand how much I would miss all of you. Though
you don't know me from a random poster. I know you all.

Thanks for a wonderful community, and making a truly great game that
much more fun.


And for the last time, DING!

Thanks for the Gratz :)
