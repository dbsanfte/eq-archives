What I find interesting, as a 1 month EQ newbie, is that when I first
got the game I remapped the movement keys to W=forward, S=back, A=turn
left, D=turn right, and moved attack up to Q.  I tend to use that
configuration for all first person games, so I can use the mouse-look
feature and still be moving and have my left hand close to the number
row.

It's as if they read my ini file!
