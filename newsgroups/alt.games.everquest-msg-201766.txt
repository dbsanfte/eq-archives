Hee hee I rememeber it well.
Actually the guys that I now play EQ with are half of one of my (3) old D&D 
groups.

Best memory was "Against the hill giants", When we were aproaching up the 
glacier and our trigger happy mage heard movement comming from a cave ( 
blooming Yeties). Unfortunatly he forgot that Fireball has an area effect 
and that he had no idea how large the cave was. Back draft style blowback 
hillarity ensues, including 2 party members getting knocked off a cliff.

{I would love to see stuff like this in EQ (or EQ2)}

From that point on when ever he said begin casting our enevitable responce 
was "duck and cover".

Out of that 4-5 man party 3 are still grouping in EQ some 9 (OMG I'm old) 
years later. My Dwarf warrior is now an errudite enchanter, the gnome 
wizzard is a barbarian shaman and the human caveleer (yes we played with 
lots of addons) is a bard. Looks like we have all had identity crisises in 
the mean time :-P
