I'm not trying to tell you what to do, but from what I've heard from
many people, if you're not interested in grouping, a warrior isn't
really that good of a class for soloing.  I've only played one to
level 14 so I'm hardly an expert, but I imagine there are a number of
folks on this NG who have high level warriors who would tell you the
same thing--that when you get higher up in levels you'll have more
down time because you'll have more HP to have to recuperate, plus the
higher level mobs start hitting a lot harder and can take you down
faster, so even the blue conning mobs that one usually could beat at
the lower levels will start to give you trouble at higher levels.  

If you want to play a melee type character that can solo better, a
beastlord would be a good choice.  Also, paladins, rangers or
shadowknights can heal themselves to cut the down time (or life tap if
they're an SK) and have spells that can get them out of trouble, so
they would be better soloers than a warrior.  (also monks, while a
pure melee class like a warrior, get the mend skill to lower down time
and at level 17 they can feign death if they get in a jam, as long as
FD works!)  

But if you do want to continue to play a warrior but want to solo,
that's your business, but, as I said, from what I've heard from
others, when you get higher in levels you'll probably get faster
experience with a group or at least a healing partner.  That's just my
suggestion and you're free to ignore it if you want! :-)
