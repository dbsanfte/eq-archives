I think she was generous giving two copper one was surely enough. As
for the rez some one rezzed me for 75 plat into the middle of an
ongoing battle (Of course, I died) they then expected another 75 plat
for another rez ! ! !
That's begging just in another package


Ps I didnt have the plat for the first one some other kind person gave
it up willingly
