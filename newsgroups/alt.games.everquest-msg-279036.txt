Anyone have an idea why my computer keeps shutting down in the middle of 
gameplay.  It doesn't seem to happen when I play any other games (though 
I can't be certain because I don't really play my other games that 
often), but it seems to mostly be happening during eq.  It's not even 
like I get that screen that says "logging off," "shutting down," and so 
forth, it just turns off without warning.  I don't even get lag or 
anything before it happens, just poof!  it turns off!
