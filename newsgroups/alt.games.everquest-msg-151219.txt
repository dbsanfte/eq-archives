Ubisoft is officailly distributing PoP in Europe had rumor has it that this
version will be incompatible with
ALL exitsting servers.If you want to continue as you are and play PoP you
will need to import the product from the US/Canada.
Otherwise you will only be able to play on the new Ubisoft "Renaissance"
servers.
No official word has been released about this and Ubisoft will issue a
statement in 2 weeks.
Furthermore, whether the Euro version will be combatible or not, it is not
due for release in Europe until  December 13 (according to amazon.co.uk).

Game, EB and Virgin lists Kunark and SoL, no Velious or PoP.
HMV list kunark SoL and the Gold pack.
PC World does not list any EQ products.

Good hunting.
