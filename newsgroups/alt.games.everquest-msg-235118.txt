Yup. Not sure exactly where the one in Cab is. Basically, you go to
your race's hometown's tribute master. No other will work for you.
(Which means if you've fucked your home faction, sucks to be you.
Shoulda thought of that before you put phat xpz and lewtz above
faction.).

>HP regen?  AC?  or any of a combination of those things?

FT, regen, focus effects, ac, stat buffs, ultravision (The nightblind
races will love that one), etc effects. One effect per tribute buff,
and you're limited as to how many tribute buffs you can have at once
(don't recall the number offhand). Every 10 minutes, the cost of the
tribute buff is deducted from the amount of points you've gathered
from donating to the tribute master. If you can't afford to pay a
buff's cost, it wears off.
