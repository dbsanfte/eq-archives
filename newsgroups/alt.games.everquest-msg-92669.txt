As usual, EQ Techies haven't responded, and my search on the support page
and in past postings came up with nothing.  But I thought I read a post a
while back with the same problem so here it is.. Been playing since the
first year EQ came out and haven't had this problem yet so any ideas?

I get to the server selection screen fine... I select Terris-Thule... It
clicks as if it is going to show the splash screen for EQ then it keeps on
clicking resulting in an error.

Only thing that has changed is that I just crossed over to a Cable Modem
that is running around 2.2 Mbps on average and didn't have this problem with
my DSL 800Kbps.  I updated the registration information because some how it
was all lost (didn't have time to play for three weeks, figured it was
because the new "Legends" server).

Thanks for any help...
