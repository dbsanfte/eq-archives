You apparently have a different Sebilis than we do ; )

Used to be that Velks was crowded to the point of overflowing (30 - 40
people, small hunting area), and Seb was moderately crowded,(30 to 40
people?) but you could always find a spot to go.  (Especially if you took
one of the harder camps).   Since the exp patch though...  60 - 70 people in
Seb, every night.  100 plus if theres a Trak raid, the 60 is just the exp
crowd.

On the other hand, we went to Velks last night. (For a change of pace,
*never* go there because it is so crowded.)   Only 20 people in zone,
neither upper or lower kobolds were camped.   No idea why everyone has
suddenly rediscovered Sebilis on E'ci, but they certainly have.

Yep, often.  Have to remember I'm used to the level 60 paladins ; P  They
can heal decently enough to keep people alive (not even counting lay hands)
and if someone died, they're usually the one that has to bring them back via
rez.

I'm sure it was.  If it lands full, Ice Comet can hit me for over 1100, and
all the Krup Wizards get it.  Only Ssra Temple has more dangerous casters
than Seb, since the casting patch.

Well, the reason I really mentioned it is that it does work, and it works
pretty well.  It's also one of those things that any paladin can get, given
a little time.  You don't need to be in an uberguild farming NToV to get it.
And once you do, well, my paladin friends solo places that I couldn't dream
of fighting in.  And effectively.

It'll happen. : P~   Especially once you finish the Firey Defender (or
Nature's Defender, if you're Tunare type)   Both have nasty stun type procs,
which go off all the freaking time.  Add to that divine might stun procs,
and it starts becoming a real issue.
