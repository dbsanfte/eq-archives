Yeah, I've seen that movie too. In my case it was a warrior who insisted on
rolling on a WIS augment to enhance his blacksmithing skills. He won the
roll and I came in 2nd. Unfortunately, there was nothing I could say about
blacksmithing without coming across sounding like sour grapes or an attempt
to weasel the augment out of him. So I let it pass and made a mental note
that got resurrected a little later when he grouped with our core team and
everyone unanimously put him on our ignore list. What are you gonna do?
