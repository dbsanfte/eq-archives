    Yeah, 60-62 without solid raid-level gear is going to be a problem when
crawling. Especially in the pusling tunnels, where the cobwebs stop you from
clicking on a mob to target it. You end up moving forward to get proximity
aggro, and that's when you realize exactly how many puslings are in those
passages and how close they are to one another.

    On what wave did you attack Paffa? I used to do the event with a group
of four (two clerics, two necromancers), and we'd attack him after either
the third wave (right when he becomes targettable) or fourth wave. If we
wiped, the puslings would continue to respawn for about 30 minutes, then
there'd be depop. Be sure to have along someone that can use the mask,
gloves, and cloak when you do him. Those seem to be the common drops, each
with about a one in three chance of dropping, with spectrals being quite
rare and the necromancer earring being extremely rare.

    We did that once - we actually talked a wizard with the fast evac AA
(Exodus?) into training the entire room. He aggroed them by casting his
snare on Paffa, then running. Big mistake - his snare is AoE, so he actually
snared three mobs, and as the rest of us ran in we ran past the three snared
mobs, who kept going after the wizard and ended up chaining aggro to half
the mobs in the zone. Ah, the joys of learning!

    It's a dead end.

    You can train him out of the way, run like mad to get in without aggro,
and try and deal with the mobs in the next room if you like. Invis won't
work. If you're in the room past where he is (so forward, and to the right
if you're facing Carprin), you won't be in aggro range of him at level 65.
There's plenty of stuff to kill back there. When a guild necromancer and I
once got caught behind a repopping Carprin, we found that we had just a
little bit of breathing time before repops happened after clearing the
entire area. Given that our DPS was about equal to a full group's DPS, I'd
think a group could keep itself occupied back there.

> Are the traps much tougher than the ones in Dragon Necropolis?

    I have to be honest - I've never adventured in Dragon Necropolis. The
one time I even zoned in was because a rival guild trained Klandicar on us
right after we killed Myga, and I zoned right back out as soon as "all
clear" was called. From what I've seen, you can get anywhere from one to
five of these little flies spawning. Very low HPs - a charmed Corrupted
Knight could kill one in maybe ten seconds, which is twice as fast as they
kill puslings or caster undead. They do hit hard, though - couple hundred
per hit. If you get one or two, you should be fine. If you have a good crowd
controller, you should be fine. If you just let the puller die/feign, then
pull them normally, you should be fine. If, as often happens, the puller
trips a trap just as he's bringing two or three mobs to camp, and he gets
three plus flies, and the crowd controller can't target the flies because
they're so small, and the healer gets heal aggro on the first cast and goes
down in a heap, and at that moment a wanderer hits the group from behind....
I'm sure you've been there. ;-)

    Like I said, if you go deeper in you'll get plenty of drops. Bring a
ranger and track the Bubonians from the zone-in. I'd be surprised if at
least two mini-nameds weren't up. And the stuff they drop still sells for a
few K each, assuming nobody in the party will use it. And it's of sufficient
quality that many people will use it - I'm an uberguild cleric over 4000 HPs
unbuffed, and I still wear the Skull Charm I won there shortly after gaining
CoD access.
