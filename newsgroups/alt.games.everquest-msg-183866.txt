It is *amazing* how many useless quests they have created.  I'd guess
they must have to meet some quota on quests.

The shopping quest was great for reducing downtime in my high 30s. 
I'd get a KEI, gate to dawnshroud and quad wolves.  After 0 mana, I'd
gate back to Nexus and run the shopping quest until I have 100% mana
again.  Rinse and repeat.  No sitting on your butt stuff.

Guess the next nerf will be to reduce the money so you can't make 30pp
from it.
