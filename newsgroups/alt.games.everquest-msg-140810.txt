::sputter:: I don't see you sending any tells either!  And I've looked 
for you quite often, got you on my friends list, but you're never online 
when I check.

Hm. Well fletching I always do in EC anyway.  Pottery, I only do when 
I'm making poison, and then I just buy 2 stacks of sketches and however 
many I successfully make is the amount I go with :)  So that's a much 
better set-up.

I like my explanation better *g*  But I see your point.  Nothing like 
trying to put some cookies in the oven when there's three ogres sitting 
on top of it.
