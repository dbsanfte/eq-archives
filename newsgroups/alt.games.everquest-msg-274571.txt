Yep, the only reasons they cannot use would be race, religion, national 
origin, disability, and age.  There are actually even some exceptions to 
those, such as, it is ok to discriminate based on age in some situations.  
However, if they decide that they will ban everyone who is wearing a red 
hat today, they are perfectly within their rights to do so.  Likely they 
would lose a lot of other customers too if they started making arbitrary 
decisions such as this, but, it is their choice to make.  Given that 
there does not appear to be a drove of people leaving the game based on 
this, and other, bannings, I'd guess that there is not a problem in most 
players' minds.
