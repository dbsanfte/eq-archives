Get some SoW potions and head over to the Eastern Wastes. The giant fort
right inside the zone from GD is pretty good xp. But, I went from 39-47 at
the prison camp near all the Ulthorks. Just get as many mobs as you want and
start running in circles. I advise getting a good drum as well, Giants go
down sloooooowly, but the xp is awesome. Stay away from the Interrogator of
Ry'Gorr unless you got charm kiting down to a science (Sic Giant on him,
he's a caster).
And one last thing, I prefer Dot kiting over AoE kiting. AoE can take a bit
to drop mobs here. But it is worth it. Charm kiting here works great too.
