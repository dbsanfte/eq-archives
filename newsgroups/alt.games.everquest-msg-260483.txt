SOJ's are not the best targets, they are targets of opportunity.  The 
key is to fight only in rooms, back from the doors, because there are 
tons of festering rats that will add on you if you fight close enough to 
them.

Go into a room, set up in good positions away from the hall (the 
prisoners aren't KOS, so you've got plenty of time to get positioned 
right), then kill the prisoner/s.  Now if you like, you can pull 
sentries and rats into your room, or you can move on to the next room.

Once the north area goes LB you can move down the stairs where you'l be 
seeing Gaolers of Justice, and prisoners of around their level.

Or better still, you can move into the Death Row/Mavuin's Hall area, 
where its nearly impossible to get more than two mobs at a time, and 
usually you can make that one at a time; these mobs are around the same 
level as the Gaolers but drop a lot more loot, if stuff that vendors 
from 50 to 300pp is worthwhile to you still.
