I was in charge of the loot during our guild's Najena raid tonight, and 
I just want to ensure that I don't accidentally sell something to the 
merchants as 'useless except for slightly increasing guild coffers' if 
it's actually worth something.  If someone wouldn't mind taking a 
look... I mean, I know some of the tempering stuff is supposed to be 
valuable, but I don't know which ones and why and for what, and so on.

Thanks in advance
Ryou

Essense of Fire - only thing I can find on Ally's is this quest: 
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1601 - minor reward, 
not useful to anybody in our guild.  All I can find *off* Ally's is that 
it's 'now stackable' in old news files.

Regeant's Pouch - dropped off of magicians or necros in the Bonecracker 
room and near, can't remember which.  Got 4 of them, can't find a thing 
on them, either with Ally's or Google (I'm not sure I'm spelling it 
right, but I tried different spellings)

Bloodstone - just a jewelry ingredient, from what I can find.

Small Ball of Clay - all I can find out is that it can also be foraged.

Lava rock - brewing ingredient?

Drop of mercury - temper ingredient?

Russet oxide - temper ingredient that also seems to be a ground spawn 
(ie, worthless)
