I am the same level as you.  Check out my Magelo for some ideas.  I
still have some newbie stuff but have upgraded a few slots.

Most of the gear I have can be had at the bazaar relatively
inexpensively.  I would suggest getting 2 things right off the bat,
Kobold Hide Boots and Moonstone Ring for their focus effects
escpecially if you are soloing.  They were both pretty inexpensive. If
you like your acolyte's anklet you could buy a Serpentine bracer
instead of the Koblod boots but I seem to recall that was expensive.


You should consider getting a misty thicket picnic too, I picked up a
couple for 10pp, they are great as long as you remember to force feed
something else.

I am saving up now for some Coldain Skin Gloves they seem to go for
about 2500 pp but look mighty sweet.  I am one item shy of the Fine
Antique Ring too.  I am waffling on whether saving 10% mana is worth
losing 6 wis from taking off my Plat Jasper Ring.
