Lots of good answers so far. Couple possibilities come to mind:

1. Your son made up the high level player story. (Sorry. No offense, but
it's possible because of the number of other things wrong with the
story.)
2. He saw some landmarks, water, etc. and was confused as to his
location. If he saw actual Cyclops, that narrows it down quite a bit. I
agree he was most likely in the Karanas and was near the river. That's
the most likely scenario.

To find out, see if your son had logging on. (If he shares your account,
you already know if it's on or not.) If so, check your log for his
character. Last entries should be "You have entered East Karanas" etc.
so you'll know where he was, plus you could get the name of the porter.
Might not be able to do anything about it, but at least avoid that
person in the future and not help them, group with them, etc.

Next, what can you do? Well, no assurances, but if you give your sob
story of your son deleting his character to a server GM, they *may* just
take pity and restore the character, rather than pissing off a player
and having them quit. It's far too late to /report the porter now, but
if you just /petition in-game and ask for a character restore,
explaining that your son blew his cool and deleted the character, you
just might get it. If *very* lucky, might get a port to the body and a
chance to loot, etc. but I dont' know if a corpse survives a delete.

Last, you could explain to your son that someday, in perspective, he'll
realize that losing a seventh level ranger (unless twinked to the gills,
but it doesnt' sound like it) is really not much of a setback. You could
plop me down on a brand new server some saturday morning, and I bet I
could have a 7th level ranger in patchwork armor before lunch got too
cold.

Now, if I were to lose my 53 warrior and all his gear......... well,
that's a different level of temper tantrum there. ;-)
