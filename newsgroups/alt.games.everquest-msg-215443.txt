Friends,

My first login after the release of LDoN, my Enchanter was in PoK. I
immediatly heard a voice telling me to go to my home town. When I
zoned into my home town (Erudin), the voice told me to visit so-and-so
(can't remember her name). Anyways, I found her, hailed her and
nothing. I was not invis, I was not illusioned, she just wouldn't
respond. There was another guy in the zone and he couldn't make her
respond either. No biggie. I went to WK and talked the the cat chick.

The next day, I thought I would get my Cleric a stone. I gated to PoK,
the voice told me to go to my home town. I took the book to
Butcherblock and again, the voice told me to go to my home town. I
zoned into Kaladim - no voice. Zoned to North Kaladim - no voice. I
look around a bit and I think I found the right person, but no
responses to hails.

No biggie. I knew the answers to the questions, I would just go to the
guy in BB that gives out the stone. I hailed him. I forgot what he
said, but it wasn't the start of the questions to get the stone.
Again, off to WK.

Now, I want to get my Warrior a stone. Does anyone know the person in
Freeport to talk to? And, more importantly, do they respond to hails?

Thanks,

b.
