While I'm not a paladin, I've been happily soloing POJ while LFG for a 
while now, the exp is certainly not astounding but its not bad, there's 
a 119 ZEM in POJ, and its fairly easy to get single dark blue mobs so far.

My Mage did a lot of this too, and as you level up you just have to go 
in deeper, down a flight of stairs, to keep finding dark blue mobs.

With Lull and root you should have an easier time of it, both zerker and 
mage suffer from a real need to pull singles in order to kill at all 
efficiently, and many of the mobs come in pairs or more.  However, until 
you get quite deep, one of the great bonuses of POJ is that the mobs 
aren't KOS, so you can rest easily, even go AFK for extended periods of 
time in almost complete safety (you could potentially be trained 
anywhere in the zone, but its unlikely if you rest inside rooms)

With an enchanter friend (a very frequent companion) I can literally 
kill 5 times as fast, and pull faster too because I don't have to be so 
careful.

Velks is also fun, but I wouldn't want to do that with a bot on 
autofollow... you'd be getting him back up off the ground floor more 
often than you'd be killing!
