If you want to make a "tribute" to Chan why not call yourself something that
you know and others would know to be connected to him. Like altering the
name Wong Fei Hung (alter not misspell) so people could still read where the
influence was from (although Jett Li */spit* is probable more famous for
that role) or use Yuen Lo, Chan's school name (all the students carried
their Masters name some of them still do in film, that's why you have the
likes of Yuen Biao and Yuan Wah) just use a little imagination.
