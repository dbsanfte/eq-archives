You have one flawed assumption here. A skill of 75 does not equate to
75% chance of success. Not even close, in fact. Also, no matter what
skill you have in anything, there's always a chance of failing. A tailor
with a 250 (max possible) skill can still fail when combining ruined
pelts with a pattern.  My dual weild skill is (I think) 225, and yet I
don't swing with both hands on every try. Monks with 201 lockpicking
still have to try some locks a couple times. The list is endless.

That said, the higher your skill, the less often you will fail. So yes,
you should keep any skill that you actually plan to need/use at its
maximum wherever possible.
