Things went South....

look at a map... where is north... ahh now where is south...   Thats
where it comes from... things went down... bad, no go, fubar, all ate
up, shit hit the fan.... etc..

Ive never heard of the refrence things went West...

Im curious... are you not from america?  if so, America is often
called the west.... so it could be a deragatory remark in ref to the
wicked west...
