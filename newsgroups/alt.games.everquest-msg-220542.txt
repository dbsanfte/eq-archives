|Can you give a basis for the last statement?

	Easily.

|Druids, as the original parent class to Rangers, can understandably have
|tracking.

	No, they can't.

|Druids are priests of ALL the wild things, wolf and bear and lion
|as well as plants and rivers.  

	That's nice, but they are priests, not woodsmen.  They spend their time
worshipping their gods and ministering to their congregations, not hunting.

|Tracking logically makes sense there.  

	It really doesn't make any sense.  Both classes work outdoors and worship
the same gods -- that's the extent of the similarity.

|Druid
|tracking is about half of the range of Ranger tracking; my 34 ranger has a
|wider range than my love's 61 druid.

	At a tracking cap of 125, Druids have slightly over half the range of a
Ranger.  I forget the exact formula now, but it's a constant (500m?) plus a
linear multiple of the skill.  That distance is scaled down indoors.

|not well.  And Bards don't track well - my Bard's tracking is maxed for
|class, and he's unable to track things *in visual range!*

	Bard tracking caps at 100.  Druid Tracking was raised from 50 to 125
because of that.

|What good is
|that?  I only use tracking when fighting near a spawn point to know when
|something's up - "Let's finish up this Goranga, the named is up at his spawn
|point on the other side of the hill" sort of thing.

	What do you think Tracking is good for?  For 90% of what anyone actually
does with Tracking, Bards are just as good as Rangers.
