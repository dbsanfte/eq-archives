Roleplaying is what you make of it. You can roleplay with just a chat
program if you wished to. Its not the game itself that prohibits
roleplaying, its just that most people on most servers choose not to
(or dont know what roleplaying really is). From my experience in many
RPG online games, this has seemed the case. If the original poster is
a hard core roleplayer, then he/she might consider playing on the
Fironia Vie server, where most seem to at least attempt to roleplay.
