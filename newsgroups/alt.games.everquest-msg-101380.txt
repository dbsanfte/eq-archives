The US is much larger than the UK. I've found that in general most
Euopeans don't understand the sheer size of the US. There are quite a
few individual states that have more acreage than all of the UK. I
live in Washington state, north of Seattle. One of my mom's friends
said her parents were from the UK, and when they came to visit for a
week, they wanted to borrow her car for the last few days to drive to
visit some friends in Chicago! That's more than 2,000 miles away! In
most areas, people are not as densly packed as in Europe, either. The
urban and suburban areas of where I live stretch for 70 miles
north/south, and probably 40 miles east/west. And while it would be
possible for those living in downtown Seattle to consider trading
their car for a bicycle, they would pretty much never be able to leave
downtown Seattle. You practically need a car to get to any of the
areas outside downtown, especially if you're a fishaholic like me. Can
you imagine showing up on a bus in a full suit of waders, with a bunch
of poles, a net, and a big tackle box? A car of some kind is pretty
much a necessity to live in the US if you want to get anywhere.
