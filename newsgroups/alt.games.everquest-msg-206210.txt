No. THe CD keys are not really CD keys despite being on the jewel case,
they are account keys. They are used to activate an account (ie give
access to) on Sony's servers. They are not used to install the software on
a machine.

Buying the CD's off Ebay means you have a copy of the software you can
stick on the machine - you'd nneed to buy another key (or another copy of
the software with the key).
