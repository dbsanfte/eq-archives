I sure hope that eq never, ever, ever,EVER has houses... Such nice landscape
ruined by houses and shacks, trying to run away from a mob and having to
navigate through suburbia.  I think a bank vault is ideal.  The only thing
I'd like changed is not have all items available at any bank.  I for one
would have liked the banks to be separate so if I need a particular item in
a bank, I have to go to the bank that I had it deposited in.
