I"ve considered this option, actually it makes a lot of sense.

I'm told that raids aren't for exp, nor should I expect any
loot.  If my principle job as a cleric is to camp out if anything
bad happens so I can log back in and res everyone, then
wouldn't it make sense to get to a safe spot and camp out
there before the fighting starts at all?

I could go play one of my alts which is also in the guild,
and camp back in to res the hapless people who were
relying on a shaman as a healer... or to make rolls on
any cleric usuable no drop items.

Any other clerics on the guild could actually do their
jobs, since we'd know there was a Res cleric successfully
camped out, instead of having 4 clerics -all- stop being
healers any time a pull looks bad!
