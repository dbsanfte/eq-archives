I quit EQ...again....it started to become work.
NO, you cant have my stuff.
See, my ISP was down for a bit...and, while it was down, I found a new zone.
Its that one on the other side of the front door.
There is this big bright thing that moves, and brings pain when I look at
it....but, it can be avoided.
There is a box in front of my dwelling...that I find drops in.   Granted,
they are just paper...called "Mail", but, still fairly common.
Warning, if u go in to this zone....dont do it naked.   NPC's look at you
funny.   They run away if you say..."Its ok d00d, corpse run"

Good Luck Peeps.   Have fun with the game.   Keep it balanced with life,
thats all.   I think EQ played a factor in my divorce, ate up time I could
have been using a bit more positively, ate up a few hundred bucks, a few
dozen or so sick and vacation days, carpel tunnel, some quality time with my
kid, various other things.  The folks that can balance it...../salute.
....and hats off to you all.   Parts of it were fun as well.
hehe...I got a friend in to the game....He wanted to walk across the old
world.   He was like level 5.   We got to WK....and that long run up the
hill.  Know where like that rock bridge is that you go under?   Well, I told
him to NEVER run under it.....you have to go as slow as possible......or he
will wake the dragon, get killed, and most of the zone wiped out.   We get
most of the way under.....and a tell him to RUN....DONT LOOK
BACK>>>>ZONE......DRAGON IS AWAKE.   Ok, he zoned to Highpass.
Few months later, he is like 40th level.   Never been to WK since....doing a
run thru with the guild.
In guild chat....he tells everyone WTF are you guys doing....dont wake the
dragon....SLOW DOWN......SHIT.
I about died.
Thats the stuff I remember the best from EQ....the drops, the plat, the
camps.....thats all secondary.   Make some friends....thats what the game
should be more about.

One last thing Ill say....the owners of EQ are the MASTERS of what they
do....creating an addictive game, where, there is always a better item,
camp, time sink.
Oh well....that big orange ball is moving...and is headed for the horizon.
Gonna go and zone out to the other side of the front door....naked.
