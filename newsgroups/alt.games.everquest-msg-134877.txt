A) Why on earth would I spend plat for this?  I'll do the quest myself
if I want it that bad.

B) At least half my exp has come from soloing, most of it root
and nuke soloing.  Since the cloak won't up DOT damage
or AOE damage, its actually more useful for me than it is
for you, for solo purposes.  Since I'm a mere 59 cleric, and
have all of one AA point, I've got a lot more exp work in
front of me...

C) I also have a 997 damage nuke that doesn't have all
that bad a ratio.  If I have 20% more damage then the
ratio sucks even less.  Clerics tend to not nuke due to
the fact that their heal mana ratio is even better than their
nuke ratio... but quite often while clearing in to the boss
mobs, nuking is a good use of an otherwise full mana bar

C) not druids?  Surely they are also counted among the big
gun nukers?  If you give the caster nukers cloaks and not
the druids, then the really will be able to complain that they
have no role at all in a raid.  Might be better to see druids
with cloaks and not casters, even things out!
