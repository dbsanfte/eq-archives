Okay, I'll bite, when has anyone ever been assaulted out of
the blue by a "nut-job 'Second Amendment' NRA type",
due to the "nut-job"'s defense of the Constitution?

Note:  Contrary to myth, not every criminal using a gun
is a Second Amendment activist, or an "NRA type" (whatever
the hell that is), any more than a hatemonger is a
"First Amendment ACLU type".

The anti-gunners like to make hysterical noises about
the alleged violent natures of the "Second Amendment
extremists", but the ironic fact remains that more people have
been shot by anti-gun activists than by pro-gun activists.

Actually, the funny thing is that if we read the actual original
intent of the Second Amendment and truly followed it, most Americans
would wet their pants.  The framers were bigger "gun nuts"
than almost anyone alive today.  The Second Amendment is
mostly "abused" today by being so watered down as to be
nearly meaningless compared to its original intent.

I heard one Congressman blather on about how a proposed
bill would not interfere with the "Second Amendment rights
of hunters".  News bulletin:  The Second Amendment ain't
about hunting.

      "You need only reflect that one of the best ways to 
      get yourself a reputation as a dangerous citizen these 
      days is to go about repeating the very phrases
      which our founding fathers used in the struggle 
      for independence."
      -- Charles Austin Beard, American Historian, 1874-1948
