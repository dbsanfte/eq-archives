I meant this only in regards to immediate payment of damages- meaning that,
like you said, your insurance will pay your bills immediately, with no
regard to fault.   Sorry, in retrospect I suppose that was a bit of a topic
shift with no warning.
Of course they're going to seek to place blame somewhere, and if it's with
someone else, and the loss is over a certain threshold, they will attempt
subrogate the amount of the loss from the at-fault insurance company.  Of
course, that is pretty much true everywhere.  Most insurance companies will
pay your expenses immediately and recover from the faulty party's insuance
afterwards.

My day job is writing software for a mid-western insurance company (who
writes significant business in Michigan, a modified no-fault state).  Part
of the job is ongoing classes in various aspects of the business, so as
boring as those courses are, I've managed to pick up a couple of things...
