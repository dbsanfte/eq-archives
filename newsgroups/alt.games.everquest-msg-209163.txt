Ok, all of the aa mentioned make sense to me but healing gift. Other
than eye candy, ego and the rare case where a crit might help save a
caster, why waste 24 points to go all the way to ahg3? You can't count
on a crit, which means you have to time heals as if you wont get a crit,
thus most crits will be completely wasted. I'd much more highly
recommend scr and scrm which turns supernal elixer into a 3k heal
myself.
