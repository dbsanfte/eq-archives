Description: This ability makes an unlimited supply of arrows
available to the Ranger.

The arrow type made available is determined by whatever arrow is in
the ammo slot.

This makes it very worthwhile to collect one of the different bane dmg
arrows, as well as holding a high damage arrow inyour packs too.

The ability also gives innate quiver based haste.

This is what Caster's Realm says.  Of course, I have found EQ sites to
be wrong on many occaisions.  Any other opinions on whether EQ gives a
ranger innate bow haste?  (I have heard it is the same haste as the FQ
and that is what I have generally accepted as true so far)
