    To be clear on this; is your modem disconnecting when you go linkdead?

    Either way, set your modem to 33,6 speed (Call optus and make them tell
you how to do this, if they don't help get a new provider). 33,6 is more
than adequate for EQ and vastly more reliable than 56k, which 90% of telstra
phone lines in this country are pathetically inadequate for. NB: setting the
port speed to 38,000bps is NOT how to set your modem to 33,600 speed, there
will be a particular string you need to send your modem in the dialup
networking setup.

    If you get this problem with your modem connecting at 33,600 immediately
get a new provider. Please don't go to Telstra though, they are the CAUSE of
the problem and the less people that encourage them the better.

    If you can get ADSL in your area that would be my advice.
www.iinet.com.au currently have the best pricing that I've seen so far and
an excellent service.

Regards,
James
