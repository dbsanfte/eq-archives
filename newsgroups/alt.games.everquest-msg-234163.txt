Today (2/4/2004 Monday 8AM) I keep getting the "Could Not Establish A 
Connection" message.  Is anybody else also getting that message?  Is 
anybody able to play right now?  I am posting this here because there is 
no scheduled downtime and all the servers say "UP".

Ever since the developers made it so we could not see the number of 
users playing on the server, it has been impossible to ever see if a 
server is actually able to be played on.  Even when they are down for 
upgrading they usually still say "Up".  Now, if I could see that only 1 
or 2 people were playing on that server then I could rationally conclude 
that the developers are testing it.  If, on the other hand, it said 320 
people were playing on it then I would know the problem is localized to 
me alone.

Wish they would once again make it so we could see the number of people 
playing on a given server.  They could include the feature in an 
expansion pack and charge us $29.95 for the capability.  <sigh>
