That is not Fear-specific; that applies to any of the higher-end
locations: planes, kael, tov, etc. In all of them you have to know how
to group and work as a team. After the initial break-in, Fear is
rather simple and easily my favourite plane. In comparison I still
have nightmares about the times we "pulled" from the second floor of
Hate.

In a pickup group with unguilded people that may be true. In a guild
where most of the members are 50+, druids and necros know their stuff
as well or better than any class.

That was made abundently clear yesterday. I have developed an extreme
distrust of invitees on guild raids after that little incident.

Ooh that sounds like an awe-inspiring sight. Fingers crossed I never
get to see one like it. Having the Prince and his entourage storm us
in Chardok was quite enough.
