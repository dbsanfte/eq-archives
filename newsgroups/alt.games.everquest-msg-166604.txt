I don't think I've ever read a clearly written opinion that could
be classed as a rant that would not come across as pompous and/or
arrogant if you disagreed with the writer's opinion.  As far as I
can tell it is a limitation of the written language.  Smileys,
parenthetical asides, and other devices can mitigate the effect
with readers who are inclined to be sympathetic to the writer.
But in cases where the reader has sympathy for neither the writer's
opinion nor his person these devices just make the writer appear
more patronizing.  Or so it seems to me.  If any of you know of a
rant written in English anytime in the last four or so centuries
that contradicts this I'd love to hear about it.
