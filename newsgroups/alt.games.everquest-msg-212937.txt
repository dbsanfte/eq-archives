After reading the newsgroups for the past few days it
seems there are two proplems keeping people from
logging in correctly.
1) Custom UI files.  Set your UI to default and it should work
2) Your server is using a 'blocked' port.  -> This one seems to
affect a realitivly small portion of the public, but is by far the
most annoying.  The only way so far to get it fixed seems to be
either have a friend or guide move your character out of the
zone they are currently stuck in.
If you want to read more on it look back on the post:
"Shared Plat Slot Bugged?" - That's where I got the information.
