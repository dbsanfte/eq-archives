I have a question.  What level players can group with other levels and still
benefit?

I was told that you can only group with players a couple of levels higher than
yourself. To do otherwise would result in your not receiveing experience.  I
was told that even when you do get expereince, the higher level character will
get the majority of it.

So please inform me.  What is known about this, and does it change as leves
increase?
