Get to lower guk and head to the assasin spawn an of course sneak hide to it
and then ask nicely for person s camping to loot the no drop mask of
deception . It is no drop for rouges and bards.
Then you can walk into the outpost with impuinty.
Also... dont invoke it planning to head into firona vi the pilgrims will KOS
you and you cant turn off the illusion it expires bt time or zoneing. <made
that mistake hehe>
