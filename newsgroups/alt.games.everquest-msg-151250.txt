First of all, Welcome! And congrats on finally taking the first steps
to many sleepless nights to come while playing this game  =)

The Trilogy would be a good start. You will most likely not be
exploring any of Velious until level 25-30 at the very least, but you
will save some money purchasing the trilogy than if you purchased each
package seperately.

The most recent expansion is Shadows of Luclin. However, I would not
pick up this one unless your computer is fairly high-end. A good rule
of thumb is to look at the minimum requirements for it, then double
everything =) That will ensure you are able to run the game with only
a moderate amount of lag and minimal framerate =) /sarcasm off

A couple of bits of advice before you start your grand adventure:

1. DO NOT beg for items/money/powerleveling/buffs/etc...

2. DO beg for advice and answers to your questions, either within this
newsgroup or in-game. Almost anyone who receives a well typed (ex. NOT
d00d speak) plea for advice or a question who's answer cannot be
easily found in the manual, will be glad to impart any tidbits of
wisdom they have or answer your question.

3. Read, if not participate in, this newsgroup. I have been lurking
the newsgroup ever since I started in December of 2000, and just
recently begun posting. I cannot count the number of times I've looked
here and gotten an answer to a question, even without posting the
question.

4. Don't fret if you look around to others your level early on, and
they have WAY better gear than you. Most likely, they have higher
level characters who "twink" these characters pass down gear to their
lower level alternate characters. Weaker gear most likely means you
will level up your skills like 1 hand slash faster than the other
"twinks" because you have to swing that rusty scimitar more times to
kill that decaying skeleton.

5. Above all else, above begging, above reading, above twinking....
HAVE FUN! Like many other things in life, this game is only as good as
what you put into it. Theres a whole world out there to explore. Just
grab your sword and spellbook and go!
