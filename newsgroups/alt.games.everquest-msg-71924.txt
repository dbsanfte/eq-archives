My cleric picked up the Truesight Hammer in hate, it procs 585 dmg againts
summoned creatures. BTW, it procs often, but would never keep it equipped,
it has a slow delay and only 7 wisdom with no resists. But, I do throw it in
a bag when I know I will be fighting mobs that have pets. You should see the
group when the cleric takes out a pet with one or two hits, lol
