I don't have Luclin but I do have the problem with combat music not
working anymore. And it's really screwed me up because I've actually
messed my autocombat key by hitting and turning it off when it was
already on because I didn't know it was on (no music), and then
wondering why I wasn't swinging. I need that music as a cue that I am
actually fighting!
