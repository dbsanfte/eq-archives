Damn, here I thought you were actually a good natured sort after
reading your "Embarassing Uvan" post, and then you pop in here
for a quick "hey look at me strut with a broomstick up my ass".
I mean, no offense intended, well, ok, only a little offense
intended, but who the hell appointed you the Grand Poobah of
Relevance?  Besides which, the OP asked about root ferpetesakes!
So how about climbing down off your high horse long enough to
notice that we are discussing a topic the OP brought up, which
test your arrogant little jibe does not pass.
