We've also been given the option to turn off inspecting people.  The
people who steer by mouse say they get lots of accidental inspections.
Why don't they turn off inspection?  I turned off inspection the same
day the ability was added.

I've had people inspecting me just to annoy me.  I've also had people
inspecting me and then start asking to buy the stuff I'm wearing.
Them, I'd like to drop in a deep hole.  Especially the ones who insist
that I have to sell to them, and I have to do it at a price *they*
consider reasonable.

You ask, you inspect, you ask for a buff, you get a buff.

You don't ask, you inspect, you ask for a buff, you get told to bugger
off.
