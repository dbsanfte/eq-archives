ANd I think it's completely paranoid to think that there are people
lurking in wait to "invade" your computer as soon as you let your
security down even briefly. Unless you've been doing stuff to actively
attract the attention of hackers, your risk of getting hacked is low,
even if you let the door hang open for a few minutes. And it you've
been actively attracting their attention, a determined hacker will get
in without you using IE and ActiveX.

Don't worry, Chicken Littles, the sky isn't falling today.
