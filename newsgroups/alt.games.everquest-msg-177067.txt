master looting is when one person loots and shares when you split.  That way
all the plat that you colllect that wouldn't be split with autosplit
function does get split more equitably.  This guy on the otherhand didn't
seem like he was doing this, as in the fact he was making sure he always got
the loot.  Master Looting everyone knows they will get their fair share (
even though people sometimes leave without getting a share ), so bodies sit
until the ML gets to it.  Sometimes you even have to remind the lazy ML to
loot.
