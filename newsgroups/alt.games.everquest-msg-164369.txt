Sounds as if you're a believer in Paladin-as-psychopath, as per what
they've got for quests in Erudin.  Sorry, but I don't.

As far as Paladins go in this game, they're implemented somewhere
between poorly and miserably.  There are things they could have done,
even back when the game went public, that would have made Paladins an
extremely fun, RP-wise, class to play.  Instead, they wimped out and
basically made them armour-wearing, spell-wielding psychopaths.
