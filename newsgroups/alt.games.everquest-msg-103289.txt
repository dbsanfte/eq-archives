Actually, there was a rather involved thread/debate/flamefest on 
innoruuk.com forums about this very issue.  Several folks from the 
server's uberest guild and the former uberest guild did some rather 
extensive testing and pretty much concluded that opening the door in and 
of itself has nothing to do with this.  If you're really interested, you 
can read it here:

Now responding to jaZZ.  I'm sure you're frustrated, but something tells 
me that this will be one of the legendary nights in your guild.  This will 
be the one you guys talk about when you're doing the long, boring Ragefire 
camp, or are farming ToV armor drops.  We had a really, really frustrating 
night trying to kill Trakanon, and failed twice.  It was getting late, 
people were logging off, and a couple of the die-hards decided to give it 
one last try.  We summoned and rezzed, and were down to 15 people, so we 
grabbed 3 stragglers at zone and rushed down as fast as possible.  
It wasn't the cleanest run to Trak, but it was fast and we were in the 
reets room and buffed in about 20 minutes.  We rushed out, pulled trak, 
and killed him with several of us still alive, including a healer to keep 
ahead of the poison.  There was no way we should have survived, we only 
had 1 warrior and 2 clerics, no necro, and no enchanter.  It's now one of 
our top memories.
