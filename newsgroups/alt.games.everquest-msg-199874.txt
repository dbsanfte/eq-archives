Althought this is almost too easy...I have flesh and blood friends =) ...
and I'm guessing you still aren't at level one spending time with your
virtual friends, so you must have done some of the redundant chores along
the way...moot point anyway, as the original poster clarified that by
repetiveness he meant scenery (aka zones), and EQ certainly gets good marks
for that...for what it's worth, playing EQ since beginning of retail, lost
count of played and deleted characters, now have three in the upper 50's and
still start twinks regularly for change of pace, so no, I wasn't slamming
EQ....just that the original post didn't make sense comparing a non-EQ rpg
as repetitive, as if nothing in EQ is repetitive--the original author did a
stellar job of clearing up his definition of repetitive and now it makes
perfect sense--same reason I tried and quit AO long ago...all the missions
were identical, same maps, just different textures on the walls.  (as an
aside, I bet you have had the same conversation with your friends more than
once--"let's go kill this, let's go kill that, (insert level class here)
looking for group".  Odds are I'll try PS when EQ 2 comes out and I opt for
the multi-game pass...gl to all...
