Froglok Scale BP isn't bad.  You're not going to find better WIS for
a reasonable price than the Acrylia tunic AFAIK.  The other option I
looked at when I moved up from my CCS was to a PSC, but that's usually
more expensive than the Froglok Scale, which should be relatively cheap.

The Emerald Dragonscale BP seems to be the one of choice, however,
until one can be looted.
