/rant_complain_and_general_bitching_mode on

I was in the North Qeynos newbie yard yesterday with a newly dinged
lvl 5 Human Ranger when I saw the following:

"LVL2_Monk" shouts 'anyone know if GF or EC is anywhere around here'

I waited a few moments to see if anyone answers him. After a minute or
so, after seeing no responses in /ooc or /shout (probobly a whole lot
of /tells though) I send him a kindly /tell, all roleplay like:

You tell "LVL2_Monk" 'East Commons is a lengthly run to the other side
of this continent, and Greater Faydark is an even longer boat ride
accross the Ocean of Tears.

After a few minutes, I figured he wasn't interested in geography, so I
made my way to the nearest merchant to sell my wares, then planned to
head to my trainer to learn how to kick. Halfway back to Surefall
Glade, the monk sends me a reply:

"LVL2_Monk" tell you 'so is that anywhere near here?'

You tell "LVL2_Monk" 'As I said before, it will be a very long run to
get there. Anywhere from a half hour to an hour if the boats are
against us. If you are interested, I will guide you to GF.

He then agrees to run with me to Freeport to take the boat over to
Greater Faydark. So I walk back to North Qeynos to pick him up and
leave. We're walking to the West Karana zone when he says:

"LVL2_Monk" tell the group 'maybe we should get a port'

Well I wasn't just about to give up in showing a low level person the
joys of traveling by foot accross Norrath. I bet him 10pp that I could
run all the way to Greater Faydark while he's still sitting in Qeynos
Hills shouting for a port. Suffice to say, he told me to lead onwards.

While traveling through the endless stretch that is West Karana, he
tells me he has a lvl 22 warrior, and the only zones he has ever been
to are: NK, SK, LOIO, Oasis, GF, and Crushbone.

After picking up my jaw from the grassy plains, he then decides that
GF is not the place to be and asks me if I can just drop him off at
the North Karana spires so he can ask someone for a port.

With a heavy heart, I bid farewell to my shortlived cross-continental
passenger at the spires in North Karana. Instead of heading back to
relative safety of Qeynos Hill however, I continue my journey to
Greater Faydark to help my fellow Rangers slay filthy Crushbone orcs.

When I zone into Greater Faydark about a half hour later
(Bristlebane's own luck was with me that day. The boat bound for
Butcherblock Mountains had just pulled into port when I arrived at the
East Freeport docks.) I checked up on my former traveling partner:

/who all "LVL2_Monk"
[2 Monk] "LVL2_Monk" 
There is 1 person in North Karana.

Well this has sparks my curiosity quite a bit. I send him a quick tell
asking why he is still sitting in North Karana.

"LVL2_Monk" tell you 'i'm still waiting for a port'

/sigh
/dance

You tell "LVL2_Monk" 'I think you owe me 10pp.'

Maybe I'm slightly biased, because my main is a level 37 bard with
selos, but I honestly enjoy running around Norrath. It still amazes
me, even after 2 years of playing, that a group of people put little
1's and 0's together to create places like Greater Faydark and the
Karanas and many other zones I have yet to step foot in, like the
Planes. Even with Selo'less or SoWless characters, I still enjoy
running from one place to the other. I haven't purchased the Luclin
Expansion yet, because my computer would most likely burst into flames
when I bring the box into the house, so I don't have the "advantage"
of speedier travel. But even if I do get it sometime soon, I don't
think I would use it very often, if at all.

I understand how some people cannot be bothered to run halfway around
the world. In situations such as a raid, porting can mean the
difference between life or XP grinding for the level(s) you lost. I'd
rather be constantly moving, running accross the continent than
sitting in one spot constantly shouting for a port.

phew.....

Okay, I'm good now.

/rant off

/em jumps off the Greater Faydark spires without first singing
Levitate, just for shits and giggles.
