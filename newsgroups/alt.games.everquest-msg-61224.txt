  Well, the way she was talking, it sounded like 256 mb of RAM and a 32 mb
graphics card will be the official REQUIREMENT for Luclin, and that they
just hadn't gotten around to saying so on the web site yet.  Or maybe that's
just her in house experience and that of the other GMs--you need those sorts
of systems for the games to be playable, and she is presuming that they will
have the official requirements reflect that, when we all know that Verant
has historically been very generous in their claims of what sort of computer
their game will run on properly.

  But yeah, you're probably right about the "real" requirements.  I think
people who are upgrading their relatively old machines to play Luclin are
going to be up the creek.  Just bumping yourself up to a GeForce2 MX400 and
256 mb of RAM probably isn't going to cut it for pleasant gameplay,
especially if you're still using a ~500 mhz processor.
