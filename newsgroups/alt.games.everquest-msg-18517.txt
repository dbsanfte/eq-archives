Maybe in the first two games this was so, but in the later Mechwarrior
games, once they fixed the interface, torso twisting became the best feature
'Mechs have for avoiding damage while continuing to deal it.  Torso twist
would be a great idea in Everquest.  Since your character can fire a bow
while running forward, it stands to reason he could turn a bit to one side
and fire at something as he ran by it.  It would involve minimal increase in
shot difficulty, especially since bows target automatically in game.
