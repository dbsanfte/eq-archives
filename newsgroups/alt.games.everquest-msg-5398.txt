The experience did seem pretty decent there at 22, as long as there was a 
mix 
of yellows and maybe even reds (which were yellow to higher levels in the 
group). But overall I did better just hunting blue tigers, goblins & sarnaks 
by the lake. Usually 1/2 blue bubble per kill, which for an Iksar, is 
heaven. 
With bind wounds and mend my downtime was minimal.

I soloed most of 25 at the goblin caves. The goblin warriors were tough but 
doable. Usually had to hit mend during the fight, which meant rather long 
downtime. And, I got to practice feign dead pulling for the first time 
splitting the 2 at the entrance, or multiples from inside. The key may be 
getting SoW - then you don't take quite as much damage during the pull 
itself, 
leaving more in reserve for the fight. The only problem I had is when a 
warlord spawned at the entrance - too hard for me to kill solo, and no way 
to 
get him to leave! :-) I grouped with a paladin for a while, and that worked 
out great. I need to head back over there to work on levelling again - spent 
most of last week in Warsliks working on my shackle quest. Of course, as 
soon 
as I head to the mines someone will kill a courier.

>Truely, LOIO is awesome exp if you stick to fort groups.

Probably the key to LOIO is *good* groups. I was in maybe two that were 
worth 
the time (i.e. got good consistent exp). The bad groups outweighed the good, 
unfortunately. Probably the most fun and best exp was with a level 28 or so 
magician - we just rocked! Best part was he hooked me up with a couple SoW 
potions, so we were fighting almost nonstop.
