What level are you?  A couple of the gnolls in blackburrow drop a Gnoll Hide
Lariat, which is a 1 hand slash weapon.  It's not great but magic and better
than nothing.
On Tholuxe Paells there is a great deal of trading that goes on in Greater
Faydark, you might try there to buy a weapon.  It doesn't hurt to do a "/OOC
young ranger without Bazaar WTB a good newbie weapon" every now and then
either.
