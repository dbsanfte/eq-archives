This is definitely true as you can generate agro even from a miss.
There seems to be a constant added per 'swing' not per 'hit.'

Problem is I think verant used the same constant for the swing and
miss for a 1 handed weapon as well as a 2 handed weapon. So Some one
dual wielding is likely to generate more hate than some one using a 2
hander.
Depending on the delay of course.
