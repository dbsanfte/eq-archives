Nevermind the clearly stated rules against organizing mass rallies and
the consequences you received being spelled out clearly as well. Not
saying the rules are right, but the CSR was doing exactly what it was
his job to do. I'd hardly call 30 people a mass rally, true, but I
don't have the policy of how many people they consider that. If the
rally was a protest, those have a tendency of growing...
