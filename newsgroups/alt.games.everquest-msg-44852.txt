Sadly, though Friedrich contacted me on Sunday and said to meet him on
Monday morning (I had the day off anyway) he never ended up logging on
and we left for the frozen North without being able to obtain the
jewelry. I still want to hook up for buying the resist gear, but we were
forced to face the dragon with my same old crap gear. But hey! Who
cares? I didn't even die this time, though I did have to run screaming
back to the clerics three times for heals over the course of the fight.
Never got feared, though, so that was good. (Better than that poor
bastard we had to pull out of the lava afterwards. he he he.) I think my
MR was at about 140 when we went in.
  How we wound up taking on Naggy last night when the original plan was
to try Vox again is a convoluted story for another day. So even if I'd
had the cold resist gear, it wouldn't have helped anyway. Guess I'll
definitely just buy both. Oh, and Tiru has already indicated that she
wants to buy some +Wis gear from him as well, if that gives him any
additional incentive to hook up.
