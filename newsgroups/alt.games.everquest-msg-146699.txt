It's just a shame it doesn't work most of the time. Did some experiments
with a few guildies over the weekend, using different channels (ooc, gu,
say, shout, group, private channel) and it seemed completely random as to
who could successfully click on links sent by different people in different
channels!

In the bazaar, where it seems most heavily used, most (but not all) /auc
lines with links don't work for me, either appearing as a random number
before the item name with no link at all, or with a link spanning part of
two items that works but brings up a completely different image. Others
report being able to click links in /auc but not in /ooc, etc. etc.
