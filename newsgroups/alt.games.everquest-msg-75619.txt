Pick a card that supports T&L.  That being, Geforce2 or better, or most ATI
Radeon cards (go to www.atitech.com and research T&L cards before you buy).

GeForce cards are generally cheaper than Radeon.   Best place I've found to
go to find good prices is www.pricewatch.com, but you MUST be VERY
careful...many places totally lie out their asses when it comes to shipping
costs.
