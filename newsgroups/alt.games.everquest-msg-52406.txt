You wouldn't be the first to accuse me of that hehe.

If I was, I would add:

1: The only mobs you would really see a potential benefit on would be
Zlexak, Vuulak and Ventani. Even unslowed, the GBS's ratio is unlikely
to boost damage output. If you're fighting those, chances are you'll
already be wielding weapons which would do more damamge that the GBS,
even when slowed

2: Those mobs AEs aren't single dispels. Each dispel takes a certain
number of 'counters' off. I know Zlex takes a specific dispel, and Vent
takes a couple of L60 enc dispels sometimes. As for Vuulak, I don't
think it's dispellable 

3: Against something like Zlex, it isn't only the slow, it;s the 1250
damage from the AE. Even on non-MTs, losing 2k worth of hp buffs
shortens you lifespan considerably. A live slowed rogue does a lot more
damage than an unslowed dead one ):oP

4: I believe (but don't quote me) that once you dispel a slow, you need
to have haste recast on you to 'remind' the server you aren't slowed any 
more.

...but, since I'm not being bloody minded, I won't bring those points up
<grin>
