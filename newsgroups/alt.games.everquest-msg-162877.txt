This is deceptive. Once JP goes light blue the only animal option left
that I remember was WW. The problem is you run out of them way too
fast and the pulling is very slow since its not what you would call a
high density zone, nor is it much fun to get out of when you're done.

There's a couple other spots (ME for one) that it is possible, but
rather hairy to try. I'm talking pre-PoP of course, being happily (?)
retired.

A ranger can solo animals to 56 or so with ease, after that it is far
better to just bite the bullet and go grouping.
