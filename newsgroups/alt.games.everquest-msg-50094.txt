My friend plays on Sullon Zek and is a lvl 31 Mage (you can only have one
character on Sullon).  He is tired of being what he calls a "wuss" and
getting killed by green Mobs if his pet aggros on another Mob....last night
he told me that he is seriously thinking about re-rolling...I would like him
to for selfish reasons (I'm a lvl 21 enchanter and would love him to re-roll
a tank or shamman or something I can group with better)  but I think of all
the time he has put into it and I can't encourage that....what do you
think...have you ever re-rolled a high level character?  I guess its worth
it if your not having fun, but it just seems like such a waste...
