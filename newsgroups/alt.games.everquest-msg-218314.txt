Fact: That is an outright lie.  I will provide evidence if necessary;
      however, I encourage you to do the research yourself.

Fact: That doesn't mean punch card voting systems are flawless.

: Fact: Most problems associated with the punch card voting systems are
: voter related and NOT process or equipment related.

Cite your source(s) that prove this.  Make sure they're not biased
sources.

: Fact: Nov2000 was an unforseen event

Fact: That is an outright lie.  Many people knew about the problems
      with punch card voting systems for decades and even expressed
      their concern that a "Nov. 2000"-like event would happen
      eventually.

: where the difference between the

: punch card voting system.

Acceptable by whose standards?!  Having a dangerous man like George
W. Bush, along with his dangerous cronies, Asscroft and Rumsfeld,
in positions of power scares the SHIT out of me.

The fact that Dubya can "stack the deck" in favor of conservatives
at the Supreme Court level prevents me from sleeping some nights!

Acceptable?  I THINK NOT.  I believe the people (both the popular
vote AND electoral vote) actually elected Al Gore, but that's a whole
other kettle of fish, and honestly, I'm not interested in discussing
it.

: NOTE "Acceptable Margin of Error". This
: standard was set and approved by the fed and state governments.
: 
: Is that enough "proof" yet?

Fact: My best friend is an invisible pink unicorn.

Fact: Aliens have abducted me every year for 20 years and done
      anal probes on me.

Fact: I had sex with your sister.

Fact: Spewing bullshit and pretending they're facts doesn't fly.

: The "proof" you demand was in my first post. You need look no further
: than the fact that these systems were certified and in use for 30
: years to see that whay I stated is correct. It makes no difference
: which party anyone belongs too. They all were treated equally for 30+
: years.

See above.
