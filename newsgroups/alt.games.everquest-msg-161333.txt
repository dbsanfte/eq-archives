To give a little bit more background on my computer and the graphics card:
the GeForce 3 is the original card in the system (I built it in June).  I
had some initial driver problems with the graphics card and they seemed to
clear up after I reinstalled the drivers that came with the retail GeForce.
I have since downloaded the most up to date drivers from MSI's website.

This machine has only seen Windows Me and I  downloaded the newest update
for the OS a couple of weeks ago.  This did not help the problem either.

It wouldn't surprise me if the problem I'm having has something to do with
drivers, but as I have the most up to date drivers for my video card and the
newest update for my OS, I'm not sure what to do now in attempt to identify
the source of the problem.

Oh, I'm using a Soyo Dragon Plus mobo with onboard sound, an AMD Athlon
1800+ processor, and a Maxtor 60GB hard drive.
