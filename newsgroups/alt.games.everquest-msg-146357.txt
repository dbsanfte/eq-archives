Yeah, exactly, and group capable classes are pulling in tons more. They were
already getting more, depending on how good the group was, and now theyre
getting a *lot* more. I play a 60th mage. I'm not complaining really, as I
have no plans on xp grinding for quite a while. I just dont see things as
being so peachy.
