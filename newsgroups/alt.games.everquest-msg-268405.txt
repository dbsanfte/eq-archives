My main is a lvl 16 Rogue, and gets most XP from quest rewards.  I'd
say about 60% or more of my XP has come from rewards, the rest from
kills.  Talk to everyone in a zone, complete as amny as you can right
away, then pickanother zone.  Do the same, and you'll soon have, for
example, 2-5 quests in Oakmyst, The Bog, etc.  Kill what you have to,
then go back.  A lot of running around, but good xp and lots of cash
and rewards.

Or you can team up, and level that way.  Some of my Guildmates are 20,
and have completed their sublass quests.  I'm a LONG way from that -
too busy collecting and crafting.

I'm a compulsive collector, so spend a LOT of time in Oakmyst, looking
for ?'s.  As I do, I harvest everything I find, then bank them in the
share slots.  My new alt, still on the Isle, uses them to craft.
Because she's a pure crafter (no adventuring or harvesting), it's very
quick levelling her artisan skills.

What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
