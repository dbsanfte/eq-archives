If it's a new dungeon, one you haven't been in before, and you don't
know your way around, you'll want a way to mark where you have been.
Drop a coin every few feet and you can easily tell if you're walking
in circles or whatnot.  It's a very, very useful tool if you are
actually the first ones to explore a place, like, for instance, Luclin
when it comes out.
