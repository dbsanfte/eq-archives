In a 1 vs 1 situation, all things being equal, im terms of level and say 
being maxed and all skills & stats or whatever,
what class would do better against the others?
Or is it like a rock paper scissors scenario whereby one class killed 
another class fairly easily but they themselves can be killed by a 
different class?
The reason i bring this up is as a wizard i find im often able to kill 
things people 3-4 lvels above me but a different class cant kill because 
of nukes and so on
I was thinking its probably druid or necromancer though
druid because of snare sow so they would be hard to kill
necro because of pet + awesome dot spells
thoughts?
