I'm surprised there isn't more demand.  After all, Necros get FD, too, and
so it seems to me the odds are pretty high that on a wipeout, a Necro can
get FD'ed and survive, and then, if no Clerics got camped out, res in a
Cleric to res everyone else.  So, I'd think they would be considered almost
essential on risky raids, and so be in high demand.

Or is it that you only need one per wipeout to get the Cleric in--and then
only if no Cleric camped out--so that while they are very useful, there just
isn't enough times you need them to require having more than one or two per
guild, and so the market is small?
