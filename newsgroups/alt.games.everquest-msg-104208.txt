While I'm pleased that their motto is "do it right" (and
I call it a motto because I'll believe it when I see it),
why do they have a bunch of people working on Planes of
Power when Luclin is STILL NOT FINISHED?  Seems a bit
greedy to me to be working on the next expansion when the
previous one is not even finished yet.

Does anyone else get the feeling that Verant is thinking
that EQ is in it's "golden years" is worried that they
might be ending (the next stage is death), so they're
trying to juice everyone for as much cash/month and cash
for expansions before EQ dies?  IMO, it's no coincidence
with SWG coming-up and quite a few other MMORPG's out or
coming-out soon that they are doing all of this.  Of course,
I'm just hypothesizing, so there's not need to flame --
state your opinions if you want right along side mine (I'm
not referencing the OP -- just the flamers that tend to
hang-out here).
