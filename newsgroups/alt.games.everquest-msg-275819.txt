I killed a spider, stole a pen from the bank because I thought it was mine,
carved a smiley face into some wet cement, worked on Sunday, argued with my
mom, told my wife that it was probably the neighbor kids that stole the
phonebook from the porch after I pitched it in the trash, and ogled my
neighbor's wife's ass.

Good god, I think I just broke eight commandments in a single day.

Wait...  you mean there might be a matter of magnitude and some context for
those commandments?  Neat...
