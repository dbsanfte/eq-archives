I am guessing someone gave it to a mob to lighten their load.  It's part
of a quest.  You get the bag of bread loaves from a named Centaur in
SK.  There are several places it can be turned in.  Most cities had
someone wanting it.  I did the quest multiple times to raise faction
with the ogres.  Turn it in to innkeeper Gup or something like that.  as
you cross the bridge heading from Rathe mtns towards ogguk, he will be
on your left.  It raises merchants, clurg and ogre guard faction.  They
nerfed the exp once, but the pp is still decent.
