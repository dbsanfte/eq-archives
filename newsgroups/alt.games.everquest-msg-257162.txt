Yes, but the question addressed further back than that. Why did
rangers get archery as a primary damage mode at all? Why not warriors

Bards and druids have track as well. While druids have ranged attacks,
bard's abilities at significant range are more limited.

But anyways the question was meant from a position above EQ, not
within it.
