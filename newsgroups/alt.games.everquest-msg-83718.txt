The facts that:

1) I didn't know what would happen if I died and thereby provided a
second corpse.  Does first one go poof?  Does second one go poof?  Do
both go poof?

2) I didn't know what would happen if I logged off.  Does corpse go
poof?  Does my character go poof?

3) I didn't want to loot the corpse, as money on the corpse provided
proof positive that I didn't try grabbing duped items.

Keep in mind that this was back in '99.  Nowadays, I'd simply loot the
corpse and go on my merry way.  Life's too short to wait for a GM when
a Guide could simply have looted the corpse and destroyed the
contents.
