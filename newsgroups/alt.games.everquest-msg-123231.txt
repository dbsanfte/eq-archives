<snip explanation>

Thank you - that's pretty much how I thought it would worked, but the
thing that worried me was...

>Assist gives you the target of the person your assisting...  e.g if you
>assist me, whoever I have as my target, will now be your target.

...which made me worry that I might be having a detrimental affect on
the tank (despite not being on a PvP server).

That's probably why the gnome was getting so agitated.  We had one
group wipeout (well, 4 or 5 of the 6), which split the group for some
time because only two of us were bound in Oasis.  I think it was
during that pull, which resulted in at least a dozen orcs with several
priests, that he introduced the idea of using /assist, which probably
caused even more confusion.
