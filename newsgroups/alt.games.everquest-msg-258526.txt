Yes, but the font shoudl appear to white and the settings should take
if you change them. For some reason, no matter what option I select,
the changes wont take. Opacity is reset to 0, all particle effects are
turned off. Whats funny is that the text is in black and that appears
to be the only section effected. In addition, my keyboard locks up
occassionally and I am forced to go into window mode then back to full
screen to get it back. Very weird.
