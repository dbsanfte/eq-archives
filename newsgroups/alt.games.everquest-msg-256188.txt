I appreciate your input Monual.  
I love my guild, small but very respectable people - the most comfortable I've
ever been a part of :)  
I want to be a team player for them, and for me too.  I think I'll quit pushing
myself so hard to be "all that I can be" and try to balance out the End Goal
versus my sanity.
