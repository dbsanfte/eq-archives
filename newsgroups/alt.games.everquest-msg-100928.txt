Wow, 

You mean it has nothing to do with the increased cost of living,
global inflation, raising the minimum wage, or market forces? It's
just evil people slipping tiny increases into the cost of all things. 

So who are these people, and what "show" are they running?

Wait let me put on my tin-foil hat before you reply, I don't want them
to read my thoughts. Shiny side out right?
