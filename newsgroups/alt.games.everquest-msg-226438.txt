Situationally, it's very useful. The hate reduction part seems kinda
hit or miss though. Often I can Tigir a 4 pull (it only hits 4 targets
max) and only get one on me even if I slow them all, other times I'll
get all the ones that aren't on the MT. Enchanters I group with love
that spell. Cast it first thing on a major pull and you can do a nice
job of splitting off (some of) the mobs that the MT isn't agroing.
They can mez those without danger to them. 

When to use it really depends on a lot of things, how good is your
backup (healing/Crowd Control) and how hard do the mobs hit. At lvl 65
w/o raid gear, I tend to not use tigir's if mobs hit for over 400.
That's that cutoff where I can't really take a couple of partially
slowed mobs beating on me so I'll just malo/slow one at a time. Works
great in LDoN though to take the edge off of a big pull.
