Hi Richard,

The 2 boxes have been opened. I've registered a user (it has already been
deactivated) in one EQ server. Later, I grew tired of the game. I thought
someone would be interested to have the "second-hand" original.

Are you saying that once that CDs have been registered, you can't use them
anymore? Can't the buyer use back the account in that case?

Please advise. Thanks.
