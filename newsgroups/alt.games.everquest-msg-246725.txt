To see the game as it is meant to be seen.  To look at the game through
the eyes of the artists and techs that are trying to make a game that
is spectacular.  I play with all of these things maxed because  can
without any lag even in the midst of a heavy raid.

I just got sick of removing players names and having spell effects
turned off for no reason.  The only time I turn off spell effects now
is if the mob is small and the spell effects obscure it.

This last statement is purely wrong ... as I have said top cards, with
a solid system behind them (Mine is a P4 3Ghz with 1GB of DDR ram on an
875 board) can run this game with all eye candy turned on in all
situations except the one I outlined above.

You contradict this point further down when you say 26 fps is quite
playable.

Your choice ... with a video card that can handle it why not?

In a first person shooter such as Far Cry it is death, which was what
we were talking about.  Even in EQ it is far too slow.

I like playing at better than 60 fps, in the game with everything

My argument precisely.  If your card can handle it all, including 60
fps + in a game with all eye candy turned on why not .. and mine does o)

You are very much an underachiever in a graphics sense ... what is
worse is that you don't know what you are missing out on and that is
sad o(
