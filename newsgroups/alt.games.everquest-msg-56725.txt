It may be the pathing thing, but in WK at least the corrupt guards seem
to have an AFI, was running around and about out of mana when i noticed
that the guard had stopped following me, start following tracking back
to him when i see him and his Red to me partner i had harmonied come
running full speed at me out of the tower they spawn in.  But even the
AFI in Kunark doesn't wipe the hate list, and if you stick around long
enough without zoning, eventualy from what i have heard the hate will be
transfered to every mob of that type, and you can wind up with a
hellacious train still.  I wouldn't want to move through some of those
zones if every goblin in it, was out for my blood.  However, you can get
faction gains tha t way too, I remember reading about some guy who kept
getting faction messages at the sarnak fortress, because of that.
