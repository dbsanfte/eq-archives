hmm.  I've noticed standing or sitting when switching in EQW myself as
well occasionally.

Have to check this out again, thought it was taking much much longer in

windows but I can control which it is by choosing which I bring up
second.

Also default looks dirty.  Not sure what it is, but EQW looks sharp, and
default looks like a bad compression jpeg.
