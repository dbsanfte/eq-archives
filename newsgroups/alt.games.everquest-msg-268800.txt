When I first started playing EQ2 I never got an option to select
server. I eventually found out what to do and got some message about
taking up considerable disk space.

It seems on install it automatically assigned me to a UK server, but I
wanted to play on Najena, and when I selected it it copied the entire
game to a sub-directory. Why does it do this ? Seems like a lot of
wasted space.

Cheers,
