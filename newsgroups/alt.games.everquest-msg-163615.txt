P.S.

 I also find it very humorous that you didn't address the fact that my
counterpart felt the need to point out he worked for Direct TV. Doesn't that
fall under the "We don't care statue of posting limitations "?

 Point is, your need to be accepted by people exceeded your abilities too
see the whole picture. Your attempt as a bash is noted, yet inconclusive,
immature, and an exercise in futility at best. Not to mention by looking at
the Toons you choose to play, you like the easy ones, with an innate
affliction with the wood elf race. You must be from San Francisco I guess.

 Look me up when you have something to say that's worth reading.
