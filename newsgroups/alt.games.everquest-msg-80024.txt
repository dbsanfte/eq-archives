>TRAIN THAT WAS CAUSED BY YOU:

Pulling the front of the Sarnak fort in LOIO, I got stunned and turned
around. With my usual lack of direction sense, I managed to run
THROUGH the fort out the back door. SoW and a Fungal tunic kept me
alive long enough to pull about 40 sarnaks to the FM zone line with a
few hit points to spare.

By the end of it, it looked like the scene in Mordor.

>TRAIN THAT YOU PERSONALLY WITNESSED IN GAME:

A rogue who had been scouting for us in Hate accidentally dropped
sneak/hide and, rather than standing and dying, ran back from the top
floor of the Maestro's house and made it nearly all the way back to
the camp on the wall. It wouldn't have hit the camp, but someone tried
to tag the Maestro (we still don't know who) and we got easily 30 MObs
of planar quality.

>TRAIN THAT YOU EVER HEARD OFF:

That dragon pile up in HoT was pretty impressive. The link has been
posted here before.
