That's not quite how it works.   You can't attack any of your realm 
mates;  The home areas of your realm are relatively immune to attack;
You can't communicate with or even see the name of members of other
realms (they just show up as "Hibernian Invader" or "Albion Defender")
removing the ability to gloat.  No bind point camping (no bind points
on the frontier);   No XP loss or item loss from RvR.  In fact, other 
than the time necessary to go to the frontier, you lose nothing going
PvPing.
