You quoted 85 lines to write one line.

And the 85 lines you quoted didn't support what you wrote.

_I_ snipped down out of a 206 line post, paring things down to just the 
topics I wanted to respond to.. and about half my post was stuff I'd 
written.

The overall post I was replying to was indeed about a number of 
utilities, however, I personally was talking specifically about 
levitation, and even more so, about levitation to cross Mons Letalis to 
get to Ssraa basement as a berserker; it amused me because I'd -just- 
done -precisely- that.  And it took me 5% of my hp bar to do so, and I 
was fully healed via regen before I reached said basement.

SO my point was that that specific example was... silly.

Ever helpful, I then included a much better example, a raid this same 
character was in, same level, where he was regularly taking 10% of his 
HP in damage running across terrain unlev'd, and running directly into 
combat with no chance to heal up before engaging.  A ranger casting leve 
on me regularly would have been of significant assistance.  (I didn't 
say so explicitly, but I think you could have read that part between the 
lines, unless I've overestimated your intelligence)

SO, I was supporting your position, while objecting to your specific 
example.

If you look up higher in my post, instead of just at this single issue, 
you'll see I also noted that in the list of classes you'd rather have 
than a ranger, Berserkers were left out.  And after thinking about it a 
bit, I agreed; you -wouldn't- rather have a berserker than a ranger.

Why?  Because of the utility edge that rangers have.

SO I was arguing Your Point.

Posting complaining that I didn't get your point, implying that I 
somehow was arguing against it because I mentioned that Levitation for a 
Berserker on the way to ML was not a big deal, seems contrary on your part.

Whats the third point I made?  Well, it was questioning the idea that 
berserkers are getting all sorts of boosts that rangers should be 
getting.  Here I didn't make much of a point of any sort, I was actually 
asking what the heck the guy I was responding to (remember, I didn't 
reply to you directly, I responded to a guy that responded to you, 
namely Ben Sisson) might mean.  I think I left the impression, though, 
that I disagreed, that Berserkers weren't getting all sorts of help that 
rangers need.  Again, seems, if anything, that I was SUPPORTING your 
position.

I advise you read more carefully and try to figure out what the person 
you are responding to is saying, before you jump on him like a mad dog. 
  And I think you'll find that the practices of snipping down to the 
relevant portions of a post before replying, and of replying to each 
point directly under the portion of the post where the matter is 
discussed, will help you to do so, in addition to doing your part to 
help reduce clutter on usenet.

"Too late," many of you are saying, "too late; Lance you just wrote 85 
lines* in response to one line, how does that reduce clutter?"

Well, at least the signal to noise ratio is better.

Grage, 55 Berserker
Grager, 6 Ranger
Luclin

*didn't count the lines, 85 is a sheer guess, although it would be 
funniest if it worked out to that exact count
