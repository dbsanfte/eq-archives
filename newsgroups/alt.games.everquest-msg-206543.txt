Yes, on all the mobs you kill in the bazaar, as long as they are within level
range to get exp and close enough to you, you'll get the full bonus.

Since that number is zero, I'll go further;

Bring the mules out of the bazaar into your killing zone, park them near you,
and -if- they are high enough level to get exp, you'll get the bonus.  Then
you'll have to split the exp with them.  So you may end up with less exp than
you were with just your partnership, lets look.

Say you have two level 20 mules, and you are both level 30.

Soloing a mob, you get 100% exp.

Partnered, you get 120% exp  divided by 2, each, or 60% per kill versus
soloing.

Now, if you instead bring in your mule, you get 120% of the exp, but you get
3/5ths that and your mule gets 2/5ths, or 72% and 48%.

If you partner up and bring one mule, thats 140% exp per kill, with you and
partner getting 3/8ths each and your mule getting 1/4th: 52.5%, 52.5%, 35%.

Bring both mules and its 160% per kill, with you and your partner each
getting 3/10ths and mules each getting 1/5th: 48%, 48%, 32%, 32%.

Bring in another pair of mules and you now get 216% exp, 3/14ths per main,
1/7th per mule: 46%, 46%, 31%, 31%, 31%, 31%.

Now ideally, each member of a group at least adds proportionally his weight
in kill rate, so that you + partner kill twice as many mobs per hour as you
did solo.  This means that while you get 60% of the exp per kill, you get
120% exp per hour compared to soloing... and in practice, a good team kills
-better- than this rate by combining their special contributions; for
example, my cleric sat beside a ranger in COM for half an hour and we each
killed three mobs, then we paired up and killed thirty mobs in the next half
hour, thats 15 times the expected "twice as many" rate.

But your plan involves adding in mules that will contribute nothing at all.
So for soloing with mule, you lose 28% per kill... but you are PLing your
mule at 48% per kill, a net gain if you care about such things.

With your partner and both mules, you are looking at 96% of your soloing with
no mule rate, compared to 120% that rate if you didnt' bring the mules... but
the mules are getting PLed at 64%.

If you bring "bots" instead of mules, alts that bring something to the table
like buffs or heals that your partnership doesn't bring, they may be able to
up the kill rate enough to pay for themselves or even more than that; but it
will be along the lines of that ranger/cleric synergy I was talking about,
instead of just by being there, as the whole "exp bonus" thing might have led
you to believe.

And unless they are bards or using some form of group based spell ability, it
would be better still if they -weren't- grouped with you, but still
contributing their helpful buffs/heals; then they'd get no exp at all but you
wouldn't have to give them a hefty hunk of what you are earning.
