I have been using this method for the last month or so, mostly with a druid
PLer and a necro PLee.
The druid can go and pull a mob with snare and then bring it back, this is a
slightly different method though as the necro still casts spells. this means
agro can move to the necro at which point the druid gains agro again by
healing the necro.
It isn't without it's risks (wandering mobs, pulling agro and hence danger
from that). it is a fairly good way of doing it.
