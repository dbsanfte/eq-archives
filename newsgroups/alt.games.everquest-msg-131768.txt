One case comes to mind.....

Was camping the AC in OOT with my Wizzy.  I had previously done two 6ish
hour camps, but no success.

I took over the camp, with only a couple of hours free before I was due
to go out -- hey, you never know, right?

The AC spawned in 30 minutes.

Now, despite having honed the art of cyclops-killing on that little
island to an art, I didn't try and debuff, or root, or snare him.  Nope,
in my panic/excitement/call it what you will, I simply charged straight
at him.  Probably screaming like a little girl.

*splat splat splat*

The story has a happy ending -- once I had come to my senses, I managed
to kill him good.  ;-)

Tris.
