One of the recent patches changed some behavior on giving items to
NPCs for quests.  As long as I can remember, I could give items to an
NPC stacked (up to 4) and he would take them just as if I had them
unstacked.  But it is not like that anymore.  If you stack any of the
items, the NPC will just throw away all but 1.  You can only give him
1 item in each slot unstacked.  If you have anything stacked, you will
lose it.

I wanted to let all you guys know about it so that you don't lose
items like I did.  Why can't Verant announce changes like this?!  I
lost a mess of mineral salts because I didn't realize what was going
on at first.
