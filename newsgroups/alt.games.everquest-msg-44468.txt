I'm not convinced that level of the spell means nothing, either.

I find that low level spells tend to gradually result in fewer and fewer
skill checks as my skill increases, while casting the next higher level
version of that spell category restores the normal ratio of skill ups..
at the cost of significantly higher mana.

On the other hand, you don't get many skill ups while fizzling, so
you start with the spells you are closest to being able to cast, don't
go to the next tier until it casts most of the time, and for that matter
not until your skill up rate on the cheap one gets rediculously low.

I could be entirely wrong, of course, perhaps I'm wasting mana and
it just -seems- to help using the higher level spell.
