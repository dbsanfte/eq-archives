Having been the only enchanter on TOV raids in the past, I can
assure you, what they want can be irrelevant. Until mass group buff
VOG is an option you can be shissared, and damn well like it, while
I use mana for more important things.

Works for me. Shissar stick is still useful as a mana free haste
to throw around.

Perhaps, in a guild with twenty raiding enchanters willing to VOG
on demand, or POP haste.. But that doesnt make the weapon useless,
especially when you consider the others in your list.

Ranger epics are both useful forever. The 'other blade' has +40%
haste and +40 atk. There are about 3 (pre-pop?) weapons in the game
that outdamage it for the offhand, and even then it remains equipped
for the ATK during archery usage. Additionally, one of those weapons
is the acrylia broadsword, which no ranger in their right mind would
ever offhand.

Quack. :-)
