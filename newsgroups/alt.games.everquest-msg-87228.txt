	Look for a good two-handed weapon (preferably slashing).  You only need 1H
weapons to keep your skills capped, for now.  2H will outdamage Dual Wield
until level 35 at the earliest.

	Look for someone selling an Arbitor's Combine Greatsword (30/43, +15 WIS
+25 mana), or if you want something faster, a Silver Swiftblade (forget the
stats offhand).

	When you hit level 17, use the Gladius in your primary hand and get a fast
piercing weapon for the offhand, so you can keep that skill capped too.
