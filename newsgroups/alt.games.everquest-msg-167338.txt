Well, since I've been posting so much here anyway I guess I'll ask a
question that's been bugging me lately...

Why is it that so many players hate PvP?  I don't particularly enjoy being
killed, but on non-PvP servers, I've found life to be somewhat, well,
two-dimensional.  You fight only on your own terms, who you want to fight,
when you want to fight, how you want to fight.  There's so little drama...
very little ever happens that's unexpected.  On non-PvP servers you can
practically play the game with a calculator.  On a PvP server you have to be
a human being.  And on PvP servers there are real people, everyone has an
extra depth to their persona because of their actions in the wars between
players... guilds have actual purpose besides helping each other lvl and get
pp and gear... there are *real* factions, not just NPC factions.  I can't
imagine playing on a non-PvP server since I started on SZ.  Of course, the
highest lvl char I've ever had on a non-PvP server was lvl 7, so I'm more or
less born and raised on SZ.  Maybe I'm just biased.  But it seems to me life
without PvP might be easier but it would be pretty boring.
