Hmm, I have two computers on a LAN, but it won't work.

No, everything is stored on the server and everything is calculated on the
server.
The client just displays stuff where the server tells it to. There is some
prediction
code in the client so that it can try to predict where creatures will move
to so
the server doesn't have to keep updating the client quite so often (which is
why
you get popping, when the client prediction is wrong and it then gets a
server
update telling it where something really is)

Like I said, no client file of this nature. The client gets *everything*
from the server.
