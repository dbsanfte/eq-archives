Chipped Bone Rods (3 charges of Locate Corpse) are sold by potion
vendors throughout Norrath and Luclin, and there's at least one
of them in PoK (somebody else gave the location).  The cost, iirc,
is a little over 10pp.

I don't even want to think about how much fun it would be to need
unlimited charges of Locate Corpse.

LD happens.  Seems to be the most common cause of lost corpses now that
true newbies are an endangered species.  Last time I checked it didn't
do too much good to /loc when I went LD, since there's no way to know
exactly where I was and what direction I was moving at the moment the
server last heard from me.
