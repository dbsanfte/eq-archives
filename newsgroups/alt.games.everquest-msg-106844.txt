Interesting that you've had that many issues.  I'm running with a single 
exhaust, two intakes (bottom and HD), and a CPU fan, all running at 1/2 to 
2/3 speed via rheostats, and it's good in all but the warmest times.  When 
the outside temperature is over 75 or 80, I have to turn the CPU fan up to 
full speed.  Otherwise, my 1.4 is reasonably stable, and my system is 
incredibly quiet...the loudest thing in it is the PSU fan, at ~25db.

Mind you, I'm running with all rounded cables, everything tucked away, 
etc., so that the inside of the case has as few obstructions to airflow as 
possible.  I assume you did something similar.

If your fans were throttling (i.e. moving up and down in RPM), your CPU and 
memory likely weren't getting constant power either.  I wonder how much of 
your previous instability had to do with the power supply.

Yep.  I have the Enermax 431W w/ the fan-speed rheostat (I hate loud fans 
:), and it works beautifully.  It's a touch louder than my older Antec 
300W, but the power's rock-solid stable, and that second fan did lower my 
CPU temp by a couple/few degrees.
