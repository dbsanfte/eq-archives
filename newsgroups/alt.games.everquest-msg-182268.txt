Sort of a text-based "world" that's primarily used to talk/roleplay
with others. One of the most widely known MUCKS is (don't kill me)
"Furry MUCK". I'm not sure off hand what the last two letters in each
stand for (Multi User * * ). Not quite sure which is which, either,
but one of the two gives the players more control over the world
itself - as in, the ability to create new areas in the world and
change some existing areas in certain ways.
