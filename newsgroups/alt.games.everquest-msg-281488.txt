Let's see. Snare/ensnare, tangling weeds, flame lick, root, his best
heal, Sow, 2 fast casting (0.5 cast time, 30 sec recast) nukes and...

Taunt is also not some super aggro mechanism (so the Ranger was wrong
there). If the ranger kept fighting the mob, then the combo of probable
dual wield hits, kicks (also aggro), nukes, versus the warrior's taunt
and usually lower dps would keep the aggro on the ranger and not let
the warrior get aggro (don't know about warrior disciplines).

It is also true that the warrior should start trying to get aggro
before the puller arrives in camp. The ranger can help by rooting the
mob and stepping out of reach so the mob starts to attack the warrior.
