Why? I am just curious.

From here, you have three choices: Ornate chain, Fine Plate, or the sickle
for POTC. If you have a cleric that can imbue emeralds, POTC may be the way
to go. Plus you can sell them in the bazaar, if you succeed. The Parts for
the sickle all trivial at 180ish

Recipes for sickle are:
blessed sickle blade sheet metal, smithy hammer, celestial essence, blessed
dust of tunare, emerald, mistletoe temper, curved blade mold   183
blessed sickle pommel sheet metal, smithy hammer, celestial essence,
sapphire, blessed dust of tunare, mistletoe temper, pommel mold   182
blessed sickle hilt sheet metal, smithy hammer, celestial essence, ruby,
blessed dust of tunare, mistletoe temper, hilt mold   180
Mistletoe cutting sickle blessed sickle blade, blessed sickle hilt, blessed
sickle pommel, smithy hammer
1HS, 8/22, WIS 5, mana 20, sv magic 5, wt 5.4, DRU/ALL, recommended level 20
>250
Brewed: mistletoe temper (mistletoe cutting sickle) elven wine, celestial
essence, mistletoe 136

The only ingredient I am not sure about is the mistletoe but I think that
can be bought in any alchemy shop. For celestial essence, you buy the
solvent on the boon (bazaar or Shadowhaven) and Scent of Marr in EC at inn
3, or in Ak'Anon or Qeynos casters' guilds.

Frankly though, you'll be spending as much time combining all the little
stuff- celestial essence (no fail combine in mortar and pestle), blessed
dust of Tunare (which may require a pottery skill), and the brewed temper -
as you would farming the rest of the stuff. And imbuing the gems.

Consider paying someone else to do the smaller combines for you.

Smithing over 115 is supposed to be very hard now. Welcome to the new and
improved Tradeskills.

No.
