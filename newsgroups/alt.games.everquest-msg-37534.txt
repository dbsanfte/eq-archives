Oof.  That's not nice... Luckily, the people in that room LOVE me, so I
don't have problems anymore.

-I- had about 53 more seconds until a possible Pyzjn pop.  I screamed when I
saw the bar going red and dump me to the splash screens...  I'd promised the
wife I'd go to bed at a decent hour last night ( after 2 very late nights of
GBSing ) so by the time I could get back on, it was "bed time".  Long
weekend coming up and I plan on having a GBS by Monday!
