I am new to this game and this is my first char.  I picked a human
monk.  I am currently at lev 10 and have learned much from websites and
this NG.

I was told by a few people to have 2 weapons instead of one and a
shield.
I was also told to have one weapon and one bare hand.
I was told to not go over 15 lbs.

Which are true and which are not.

What is the best way to equip a human monk and what should I have  being
a lev 10.

I am fighting mainly in BB lower levels.

Are there certain skills to work on more?

I currently use tiger claw besides my weapons.




Any help is very much appreciated.

Thanks In Advance,


Frederico
Lev 10 Human Monk
