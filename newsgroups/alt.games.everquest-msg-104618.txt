How about umbral? A few dark assassins can put a nasty crimp in your
doomshade day. Even a moktor in the wrong place can be upsetting.

Wah wah wah.  Bullshit.  Very useful when, for example, your enchanters
are all busy manasieving/debuffing/tashiciding. Not your primary choice,
no, but a useful one.

You're obviously on drugs, or to quote you "What the hell are you
raiding? Crushbone?" Plenty of unslowable critters, and plenty of critters
that even slowed last long enough for a damage shield to add up.

No, thats 2 things you'd let a druid do.

..... 

right. And we wont have any rogues because wizards have the damage.

For us, Shamans have enough to do with focus, sta, slows, debuffs,
etc.

Ok, at last I can agree.... DoT's are damned nice but not really used
much on our raids.

Yeah? Then why do me and a druid form the basis of the KS group at almost
every raid we go to? Wizards do good damage, better than druids, true, but
druid damage is not insignificant AND they bring plenty of other things to
the table. Sure they're not the best healer, or damage dealer, or crowd
control. But sometimes you just want a lil more of everything and a few druids
adds the flexibility you want without bumping the raid size up by another
3 people.

Frankly, having a group of all damage dealers and a hierophant who can spot
heal when required (you're not the MA, you're taking a lil AoE damage or
the occasional riposte) AND add to your total damage output and buff
pool is a good thing. Every group does not need a cleric, and clerics beyond
whats requried can rapidly become less useful than alternative classes.

Like druids.

(not to belittle my guild clerics and the much loved "Cleric Killshot" ;-) )

Oh shut up. somebody else having an ability does not invalidate it being
shared amongst other classes. Its just ridiculous to say it does.

POTG, Circle of Seasons, Ro's debuffs, Nukes, Heals, Ghetto crowd control,
huge mana regen (KEI, hunter, POTG, etc) make druids useful at 60. You're
missing out. Additional flexibility is a marvelous thing, especially when
things go south or your primary raid target is snagged by soimeone else and
you head off to take something you werent expecting to that night.

Where is your raid experience coming from? "Make an uber guild 101 for
5$!!!1!1!11!" on playerauctions?

Bullhookey. I'll agree those classes are required for successful raids
in many places, but you try running a raid with only warriors, enchanters
clerics and shamans and tell me how far you get.
