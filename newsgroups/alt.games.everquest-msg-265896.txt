| Actually Lineage's big base is Korean... and South Korea is per capita
| the most wired country in the world. Also, they count 'per play'
| subscriptions as indivisual subscriptions... You go play tonight in a
| cafe, that's a subscription. Tomorrow night? that's another
| subscription. over here Lineage has a much more modest 40-50k
| subscribers iirc.
|
| Final Fantasy Online has a more 'traditional' gameing subscription
| model, and the last reported subscription level was approximatly 520k
| for Japan and America. I have not seen any figures since the European
| release (But I can tell you they are there... I have to ignore french in
| the chat channels in the city of San'Doria every night, and my server,
| Odin, appears to be the unofficial Norwiegen server, based on the
| language I hear all over, (my cousin, who speaks Norwegian, verified it
| was Norwegian, though he wasn't sure of some terms... said they looked
| like Norwegian leet speak) and the new people flooding it. (Worldpass
| prices on Odin, which are based on how many are issued, doubled the
| first week after the European release.))
|
| Final Fantasy has a couple of major advantages over EQ though: It's an
| existing thematic setting (the Final Fantasy series) that is hugely
| popular, and can be played on the one of the best selling consoles in
| the world (I dunno if the PS2 is number 1 or 2 now... gamecubes may very
| well have surpassed it).

    Ah, thank you.  I was wondering why Lineage was getting the numbers it
was getting.  Granted it has the bonus of the COH play-design on removing
the suck-factor, but there were some sucky aspects that I was iffy on while
reading the reviews.  Lineage 2 seems to have fixed those issues by the way.
Subscriber numbers interest me mainly for online gaming in that once the
subscriber base starts to leave, the game usually is taken offline.  If it
is a game I like then that means I won't be able to play it ever again in
the future unless that company decides to release a standalone version or
allow a publicly owned free server.

    "World of Warcraft" looks promising, but I am afraid that the player
models have the "I'm a clone of everyone in my player class" syndrome.

    On the other hand, reading multi-lingual "Leet Speak" would be as
confusing as I suspect highly comical hilarity.
