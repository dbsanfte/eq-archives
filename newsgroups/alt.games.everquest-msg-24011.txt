Owner of 2501 Netstalker Points awarded by Corwin of Amber, mainly
because Atma's just too damn attractive to get away from.

Gave 7499 Netstalker Points to Cypher because there's no such thing as

"Way to stay on top of the news [about Mel Lastman's comments about

 any American is in the position to call anyone a racist or have you
 all forgotten the whole slavery incident."
 --Jason Barstad, 411wrestling.com's Midnight News 7-13-01

"Slavery incident? What slavery incident. I didnï¿½t get a chance to
 read the paper this morning, what happened?"
 --Chris Hyatte, in response
