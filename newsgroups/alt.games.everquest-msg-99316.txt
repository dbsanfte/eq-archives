Specializing is one thing but pigeon-holing and restriction is another.

I am all for class differentiation and classes that when combined form
a whole greater that the sum of their parts but sometimes it seems to me
to go too far.

Sure if you just want to go sit in one spot pulling the same mobs over and
over again. Grinding is yet another boring aspect of the game that seems
broken to me as well. But how about if we want to be a little more you know
... 'adventurous?' Don't we all want to be the hero type we read about in
fantasy novels? To go dungeon delving and fighting battles of epic proportions?

Instead all raids are boiled down the 'the formula' of the tried and true
perfect 'raid' technique and god forbid you should try something different.
And with the system set up as it is you will be wiped if you deviate.

Is this a game or physics class?

Cool. Now can you delv into chardok and kill the king with that party?
The deep? Velk's? The Grotto?

Well if we are just talking about exp I can just get a wizard or a druid
and solo quad kite my way to 60. Lots fun fun there! woot.

Which is why I joined a small guild that has a nice family feel to it.
We generally have a good time on the small 'exp' camp type and a for
small adventures. But once in a while we have to join forces with other
guilds and most of the raids are 'all business' types, any non raid chat is
squashed for communication purposes. Which I understand due to the nature
of the game and having limited time to get a 'raid' done in a reasonable
amount of time. The system sucks not the people.

Oh yeah the pre raid buffing routine. That's always exciting. *snore*
Fasion show? Usually the melees get board silly and start pulling
random shit or dueling because all the buffers and casters are
sitting on their asses waiting to regain mana.

Frodo "Gandalf the Balrog is coming! Hurry we need you! What are you doing?"
Gandalf "10% mana"
Frodo "what?"

Entering a fully popped dungeon to drill down to the 'uber' king/dragon
or whatever and handling multiples.

Went on a raid recently and we had 30 people. We had 2 clerics
and 2 enchanters. We got some bad luck with a bad pull and got
a lot of mobs. Things were going fine and we were killing the mobs
ASAP one at a time using the standard MA method until the enchanters
ran out of mana and then it was over. Total wipeout. 28 other people
that were full hit points and other casters that still had a lot of mana
and we got owned. That to me is just stupid. 28 doesn't even = 2?
WTF?

Ah lag and LD my other favorite parts of raids. My favorite is when
the raid leader goes LD, that's always fun. Got all these new
fancy graphics and spell effects, Cool! Nope gotta turn them all
off else you will be lagged to death.

You know I don't mind having a few mobs that require 50+ people to
take down like dragons or gods. But how many are there in the game
now?
