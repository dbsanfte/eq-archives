I've been doing commercial software development for over 10 years and
the largest programming team I've ever bneen on was 6 programmers.
That was at a company with over 10,000 employees. And it was about 2
programmers too many. Large teams don't produce better code, they
produce bloatware. As far as the graphics, most games I've seen the
last few years have used 3rd party game engines. A couple of artists
per project should be plenty to come up with some custom textures.

But that's not really my point. My point is that the PC game industry
is a niche market and it always has been. You can't have a company of
3000 employees and make money in a niche market. You CAN NOT. As all
these game company closings are ample proof of.

Here's how it used to work:

Wasteland project

6 developers, 1 of whom was the company founder
2 artists
3 odd job - office work, QA, testing

That's 11 people. How many copies of a $50 game do you have to sell to
pay those 11 people a decent wage?

Oh, but that team can only crank out a game a year. What if you want
to release 3 games a year? Simple. Three teams just like the first. In
fact, you could probably just hirte another 10 developers and move the
rest between projects as they got near to completion. 

A lot of people got rich using this method. Most of the game companies
that were huge in the 90s started in just this way. When they used
these methods, they were thriving. When they became big companies,
they started dieing off.

Which way is better?

Well, lets ignore the fact that many stores that used to have vast PC
game sections don't even stock PC games at all anymore. Lets ignore
the fact that most game companies have been losing money for years.
Lets ignore the fact that most of the original PC game companies no
longer exist. 

Lets ignore all that. I just plain DON'T LIKE 95% of the games that
have been coming out the last few years. I rarely buy them, and when I
do I nearly always regret it. This hobby of mine is very near to
extinction, for me. And I'm the guy who made those game companies rich
the first time around. Me and 50,000 more like me. Well, that's fine,
you say... you and those other fossils are being replaced by 5 million
simple minded zitfaced baggy short wearing yo-dude-what-up dorks. 

Yeah. Right. Where are they? Not playing PC games. No, what's
happening is old timers like me are leaving the hobby, and nobody at
all is replacing us. The evidence of this truth is everywhere.
