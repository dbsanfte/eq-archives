Dekark appreciate all this sage information and will strive to avoid pissing
off things like snakes, spiders and low level necros mobs for a while; while
doing similar to such things as gouls, zombies and woodland felines that are
so good at making him hesitate.... Once he gets himself a little tougher he
will make sure to teach them the true meaning of pain.

Oh well, there are always smaller cats, bear families, evil Orcs and some
undeads that don't know they died left...
