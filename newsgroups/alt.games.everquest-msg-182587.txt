i was grouped with, wait for it, 2 guildies. it was actually 1 person
2-boxing but i didnt realise this at the time and the 1 person was
trying to maintain a front that it was 2 different peeps. (officers in
guild said afterwards with certainty that he is a 2-boxxer)

we did ft3 camp in CT for 8hrs.

in that time 2 ft3 boots and 1 ring dropped.

when it came to the end i suggested rolling but i was told i would not
be allowed to roll.

one of the characters told me that i had been warned that all loots
would be for him and the other character.

i checked log and didn't find a warning.

i got no proof, no screenies etc. i got my log of course but that
isn't worth shit.

am i waisting my time pissing around with a GM or should i just right
it off to experience?

To make matters worse he's a fucking e-bayer. check this out. (off
course i could have typed all this out myself, or used selctive
snipping but i didn't):

FYI He has a title. He is Splaxx the Mystic

[Fri Feb 14 20:55:31 2003] You told Splaxx, 'u won BotB?'
[Fri Feb 14 20:55:47 2003] Splaxx tells you, '?'
[Fri Feb 14 20:55:55 2003] You told Splaxx, 'best of the best'

No answer. We were raiding. I didnt bother pursuing it.

Then on the day i got ripped:

[Sat Feb 22 15:22:26 2003] You told Splaxx, 'so how did u get that
title?'
[Sat Feb 22 15:22:53 2003] Splaxx tells you, 'what title ?'
[Sat Feb 22 15:23:07 2003] You told Splaxx, 'the mystic'
[Sat Feb 22 15:23:22 2003] Splaxx tells you, 'just wroute it :))'
[Sat Feb 22 15:23:33 2003] You told Splaxx, 'i dont think so =)'
[Sat Feb 22 15:24:31 2003] You told Splaxx, 'to get that title u would
have to have won "best of the best" '

Here I'm just trying to coax some bs outta him:

[Sat Feb 22 15:24:46 2003] You told Splaxx, 'best of the best'   
[Sat Feb 22 15:25:02 2003] You told Splaxx, 'pvp duel against other
shamans'
[Sat Feb 22 15:25:07 2003] Splaxx tells you, 'heh ya all that was like
a one big fight on gm event'


Anyways, he got booted from the guild.
