Unless Frinka is on a Zek server, then you do lose xp to environmental 
deaths, including drowning.  It does not sound like xp loss is the real 
concern here though.

Others have said it, post which server, and likely someone here will 
vollunteer to help you out.  Best bet, is to pay a necro or SK to summon 
the corpse, at level 32, I believe they can still use the cheap coffin 
for that.  The spell is level 12 for a Necro, level 25 for an SK.
