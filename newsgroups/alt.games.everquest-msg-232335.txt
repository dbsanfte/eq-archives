Druids do lose some spells indoors, true, but they still have plenty
of spells at their disposal that make them handy to have around. They
make good back-up healers as well as snaring, buffing, and dps.
They're not the best at anything, but they're a good all-around class
to have around.

The problem is too many people have the same misconception that you
seem to about them...
