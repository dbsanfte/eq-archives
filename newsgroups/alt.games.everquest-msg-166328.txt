Actually, a lot of it comes from hackers, who sometimes spoke like that as 
a simple cypher to fool early text analyzation. For example, if you are 
looking for "terrorist" most programs won't see "t3rr0r1st" as the same 
word.

Nowadays things like Echelon and other mass-scale text gropers are smart 
enough to read d3wd as well as most other languages, but the language 
remains.
