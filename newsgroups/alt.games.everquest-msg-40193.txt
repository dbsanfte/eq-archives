What about my box of Abu'kar? *Sniff* Doesn't that count as one of the best?
Hehe
By the way, it's 10 slots, weighs 1lb, 100% weight reduction and holds giant
sized items. I know..."You've been playing THAT long?"

Also have one of those 10 slot 75 percenters from a bonehead in the crypt area
of Seb. Can't recall the name, sorry. =/

These 2 plus 3 Tinkerer's and I can collect HQ ore without having to trek back
to town too often. Saints preserve us, don'tcha know.
