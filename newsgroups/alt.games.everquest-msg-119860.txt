Not sure about whether a 2-hander prevents dual wield, but last night
my level 14 necro had given his pet a rusty 2-hand sword.  I looted 3
shields and 2 longswords not long after.  I decided the shield might
help his defense so I gave him one that was in my inventory before
going through bags to find one of the long swords.  When I found the
long sword in my backpack I noticed the pet was wielding the shield &
the 2-hander.  Was a good night.
