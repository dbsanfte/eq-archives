You provide a false dichotomy.  It's not a case of "either/or."  What I
would like is for my son to keep it in his pants.  If he insists on sleeping
around, however, the local 7-11 sells condoms without having the added
effect of having a major institution endorse his immoral behavior.

Here's a question.  How many high-school students know the failure rate of
condoms for pregnancy?  How many know that they are only 90% effective
against HIV?  I didn't until I was told so by a navy Hospital Corpsman in
boot camp.  When I was in high school, I was told that the condom would
protect me.  How many students know they're taking a 10% risk of being
infected if they're sleeping with an infected person?
