Two things came to mind when I read that news.

1. It sounds like these cards will make it much easier for kids to play
*without* their parents permission.  I'm not sure that is a good idea.
(Not that I have anything against kids...my problem is with adults who
have completely forgotten what it is like to be a kid, and think that
kids need to be totally protected, and so will want to sanitize EQ.
I think I'd rather EQ remain a teen+ game like it is labeled now).

2. Won't this make account buying/selling a lot easier?  We know Verant
doesn't actually mind account *sharing* (we know this from the Jeff
Butler interview where he said they don't support it because they can't
think of a way to do so, and also from the fact that they have designed
much of the high end game to be nearly impossible to do without account
sharing), but this goes a lot farther.
