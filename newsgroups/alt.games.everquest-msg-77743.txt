My response, when someone says something like that to my Shaman is "Run
slowly.  It comes with being a ClassX".

If no Shaman is around, it should be one of your jobs to keep up SoW on
everyone.  Use yourself as a timer, then, when you start blinking, start
casting around.  6 SoW = 240 mana total.

See above.  No one should ever ask.  If they have to, you are not "group
aware".  If you know that SoW is going and can't set it up again, let them
know they will need to wait.

I prefer /role.  It lets my guild know I am on and hunting, but they won't
get the annoying autoreply if they try to talk to me.

Agreed.  But if someone is polite, I usually do it.  The spell is very cheap
for it's utility and you never know what they can do for you in the future.
