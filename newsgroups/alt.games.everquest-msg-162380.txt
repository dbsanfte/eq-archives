Nope.  Not unless you run up the first slope immediately on entering.

It is a separate zone.  Not extremely big.  Mobs ranged from level 61 to 65.
All undead, hit for 500's, not slowable.

I'm not sure if spells drop there or not.   We cleared up to Terris Thule's
chamber, in preparation for a possible attempt on her, but got no spell
drops at all.    Just a few tradeskill items and one possible quest piece.
Possible we were just unlucky though, since it wasn't all *that* many fights
to get to her room.
