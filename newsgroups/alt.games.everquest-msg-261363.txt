Because it's the only way I can think of that would reconcile my experiences
with what they are saying.  When I pass through these newbie and mid-level
zones, I see 5 players in each one, if that.  Often I'm the only one there.
Then I enter Walls of Slaughter (new OOW experience zone) and /who shows 97
people, all 65 plus.  50+ in Earth, 60 in BoT, 40 in Fire. Etc, etc, etc.

And they're claiming that all those 5 person zones added together are more
than the 10 to 15 crowded zones I see.

No thanks.  You go play your way and I'll go play mine.   Cause that sounds
like about the least fun thing I could imagine.

Yet they're screaming that theres not enough content for them, when they
didn't bother to buy a significant portion of it...
