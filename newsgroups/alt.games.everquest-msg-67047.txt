I've only seen this in Uguk until yesterday, when I got it in
the Feerrott (first time I'd been to that zone since SoL, so
don't know if it happens every time). But the video lag wasn't
as bad in Feerrott as it was in Uguk. In Guk, it was a slideshow,
maybe a frame a sec, but in Feerrott, it was more like 2-3 fps.

Another place I've noticed weird video behaviour: In TD, when I'm
on the BB, I'll get video lag when we pass the bandits on the
ship graveyard or whatever I should call it, but only when I'm
looking directly at all those ships... Time to post specs, I guess:

P3 800
VIA mb, can't remember the exact model
640MB RAM
TNT2 with 32MB on-board memory, and running Detonator 23.11
SB LIVE Value or some PoS like that, running latest drivers
DX 8.1 (well, duh)
Happens both in XP and 98SE
No Luclin
Lots of free, defragged space on both Windows partition
and EQ partition

Happens both on broadband and dialup (no surprise there, as I'm
fairly sure this is a bug in either the video card drivers or the
rendering software)

Hmm, guess I should pop off a /bug report the next time it happens.
