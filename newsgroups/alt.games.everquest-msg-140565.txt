This gives you a 10% chance of not using a reagent component when 
casting a spell which requires a reagent. This does not conserve mana.

Same as the summoned necklace.

Same as the summoned mantle. Mages don't have many buffs anyway, I've 
only found this useful for the Burnout line of pet buffs and the damage 
shield line.

You have to be at a sufficient distance for this to have an effect.

Don't leave home without it!

Mages don't have DOTs until level 44 so this is practically useless. It 
only works on spells up to level 20.

>     focus: Enhancement Haste I- Inc dur on bene spells 30%

Again, this only affects spells up to level 20.

This should have had an effect when summoning items/pets.

Same as the clawed knuckle ring.

Again, Mages don't have DOTs at your level. However, this does improve 
the duration of the Malise line of spells, which could be useful.

The mantle or the knuckle ring should have gone off.

Are you sure you don't mean the bracelet? The bracelet should have gone 
off on every DD, whereas the choker shouldn't have.

You should summon the ring and earring too. The ring decreases spell 
cast time on all spells, and the earring is supposed to have a mana 
conservation effect on DD spells.
