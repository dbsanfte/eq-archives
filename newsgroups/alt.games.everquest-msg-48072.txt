    I dunno about the the classes part, but I do know
that at one point today there were 199 people in the
Nektulos forest.  Made me very curious how things 
were going in Gfay.  Wizards and Necros seemed to 
be pretty well represented, as well as the occasional
mage.

   Well....pickup groups outside of newbie zones seem
to be problematic.  I suspect that will ease up as 
Human/Common becomes more widespread among the 
interesting races.  Hunting wisps will be difficult
unless you can get a mage to summon a magic weapon.
Too early to tell about the TLC yet.
   Oh, and I _did_ see some roleplaying.  Several times
in the Nek forest I heard of shouts "A human!  Get it!"
There were also occasional suggestions of storming 
Freeport.
