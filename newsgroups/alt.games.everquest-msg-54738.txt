Strange, Windows Update - XP - has an SBLive! update (don't have the version
handy, sorry) that will install fine, but if I install Creative's driver
that they released just *last* week and head back to WU, WU wants me to
download the MS driver again...very confusing since both seem equally as
useless at rendering my EQ sound at least bearable and stable.
