}Hi all.  I was recently excited to discover that wdespite being a
}goodie race/class, with careful sneaking and harmony, I could indeed
}turn in the sarnak war braids to Captain Rottgrime in OT to raise VS
}faction.  I knew it might take many hand-ins to become amiable, but I
}was determined, cuz I really wanted to get the OT gating hammer. 
}However, someone recently told me that many factions are now "capped",
}and that the best I can get is indifferent.  Is this true?  If so, how
}does a capped faction work?  Does it take your race and class into
}considration, then say, for example, that all Tunare-warshiping
}rangers cannot become better than indifferent?  Was this always in
}place or is this something new?  Thx for the info.

All factions, as far as I know, have always been capped.  Most of them, 
the cap is somewhere in the 'Ally' range for most people.  It's unlikely 
anyone wil know how high the cap is for your particular 
race/class/religion there, because I'll bet -very- few people have done 
that with that combo.  But when you get to the cap, when you hand in 
braids, you will get a message that 'Your faction with VenrilSathir cannot 
get any better'.  When that happens, come back and tell me, cuz I'm 
curious. :)

If you make it to indifferent while not sneak/hidden, you can get a little 
extra boost with a Ball of Golem Clay (not sure if it still drops 
though... anyone got one since the Cazic revamp?) which has one charge of 
Illusion: Earth Elemental.  It usually has raised me up another level.  
It's also possible an amulet of necropotence may do the trick, or any 
other way you can find of doing illusion: skeleton... what's that cool 
necro nuke? :)

}P.S. I was also told that puppet strings from Plane of Fear can be
}used to charm the undead foreman, and that I could still complete the
}quest that way.  Does this still work?  I vaguely recall something
}about how charmed NPC's either just eat up or spit back whatever you
}give them now.  Thanks for any and all info.  Also, where exactly does
}one get them in PoF, how hard is it, and are they tradable or no-drop?

I think you'd have to be able to do quests with charmed NPCs, or the 
Enchanter epic would become -very- broken.  But I haven't tried it 
recently.
