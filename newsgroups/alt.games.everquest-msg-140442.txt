Comical, yes.  That doesn't mean it never happens.  Come to my workplace 
sometime, as I've seen this firsthand unfortunately.  :-/  Even I've 
done this as a youth; I know many of us have during that period.

Yes, most LCDs lag behind in performance for games (just using this 
example), but my Samsung SyncMaster 570S TFT display performs very well 
and rivals my previously owned Sony Trinitron 17" display (thanks to the 
US Post Office for destroying it) that also had excellent performance. 
I do agree that LCDs, even the two I have (I also have the SyncMaster 
570V for the other machine), suffer from color precision, but it's so 
marginal that it won't make me return them for CRTs.  Now, if I decided 
to go higher than 15" or would be serious in image editing, I'd go CRT 
all the way.

...which points out that this thread has involved comparisons of apples 
to oranges.  Some people like apples while others like oranges.  That's 
the real world.  I have enjoyed the technical aspect from this thread, 
though.

I know you were asking another poster, but I'll say something here. 
It's true that my 15" LCDs cannot go above 1024x768.  I knew that before 
buying them, but I only have one reason that I would need to go higher: 
more desktop space.  However, it's not of upmost importance to have that 
at this time, and 1024x768 has been suitable for my needs - apples and 
oranges once again.

That's subjective, though.  It totally depends on the preferences of the 
user as well as what task is at hand.  You and I would see them as 
problems while my 5 year old sister would care less, for example.

As I've said before, I'm also interested in the technical aspect of this 
discussion.  You stated "a whole host of problems" is created by 
non-native resolutions.  Interpolation could be one problem, but what 
are others that can occur?  Cheers!
