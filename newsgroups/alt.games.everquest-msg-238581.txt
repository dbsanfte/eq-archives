: for the in combat macro, do this:
:
: /attack off
: /doabil 1 (pickpocket)
: /attack on
: /doabil 7 (disarm)
: /doabil 8 (backstab)

: No need for pauses (it's /pause 5 btw anyway), you'll be mashing both
: buttons enough that you won't have to worry about reuse times.
:
: make a separate evade button, this one can have your superfluous skills in
: it:
:
: /attack off
: /doabil 2 (hide)
: /attack on
: /doabil 3 (Sense traps)
: /doabil 4 (disarm traps)

I like:
/doabil 1 (backstab)
/attack off
/doabil 2 (sneak)
/doabil 3 (hide)
/attack on

I have sense traps tied to my right turn key (kept in hotkey position 10)...
I didn't think to add disarm to the same key, I'll do that when I get home.

 keep PP seperate as I only do it when soloing, and don't want to PO any
group members.
