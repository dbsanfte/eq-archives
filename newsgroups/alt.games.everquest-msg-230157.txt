Sounds like the training wasn't done with the intent of killing the
troll, in which case, I agree with you. Smart thing to do would have
been to pull the guards a little off the "main tracks", so to speak,
and kill them there.

However, had the train been intentional, then it would have been
inexcusable. Yes, "living on the tracks" is stupid, but that's no
excuse to intentionally gather up a train and run it over someone with
the intent of getting them killed.
