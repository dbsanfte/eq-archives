Well, see that's your problem. 
You assume because I have never posted or haven't post much
that I'm a troll.
Quite frankly I've been here for a year and a half, just reading the
post and "sometimes" getting good info.
And I have posted before, I find it hard to believe you can remember 
every post ever made in here.
Do you really think there's only 10 to 20 people that come here.
There's quite a few more , we just don't all post.
If everyone that comes here was to post tonight, you would be typing,
"Interesting coming from someone I've never seen post here before
today..." all day long.


But Don't worry I'll answer your question in due time.
