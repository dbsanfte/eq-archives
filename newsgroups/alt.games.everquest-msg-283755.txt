I'd have to agree with you there Sean.  These people in /OOC who're
astonished they can't kill a ("mere") decaying skellie just forget how
tough it is with a Tarnished weapon and a suit of Cloth Armour.  No
handy Regen buffs, DS or Temp from a friendly passer-by...  That was
how it was.  Stuff you can outfit a level 1 alt with, costing about 50
plat from the Bazaar at most (easily garnered before the Rat Tail
nerf) seems almost god-like now!

Mind you, the progression servers seem to be rapidly losing their
charm.  I, for one, see little point in a server where your alts get
the same zones unlocked as your mains.  They should make them
1-character-only servers, or it'll be Twinksville all over again.
