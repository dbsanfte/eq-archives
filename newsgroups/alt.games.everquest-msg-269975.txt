The best tactic I've found is to cross over the water near the left
hand bridge then walk around the side of the cliff. Be careful when you
round the point as there maybe some aggro mobs. Then just pick a spot
where you can spot people you come to kill him.

You have to realise that most people have left newbie island long ago
and once you've gone you can't go back. The number of people on
there is significantly less then it was a month ago. Do a /who to see
how many people are on the same instance. If its low, switch to another
instance using the mariner's bell on the pier you started off on.
