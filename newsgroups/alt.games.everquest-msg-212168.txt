Yes but Incomplete is at what, 57?  58?   Stoicicm kills the need for natural
regen at 44... 44!  Slicing off the 45 to 57 chunk of the game before finding
a highly efficient mana to HP converter (which is the key to shaman mana
regen, convert HP to mana and mana to HP and exploit the fact that those
conversions result in net mana gain) really strikes a blow at the heart of
troll natural regen, which already suffered from lack of scaling as you level
up.

All true, but all apply only if you are high enough level to have
alternatives.  Compare instead Stoicism to Greater Heal or even the mighty
Superior Heal... Stoicism itself becomes outclassed by even better spells as
you level up, but thats not my point, my point was rather that natural regen
(even supplemented by gear and regen spells) becomes of negligible importance
as early as level 44.

As I mentioned in an earlier post, though, I can see where you might have
misunderstood me to be claiming that Stoicism was better than Torpor.  I'm
afraid if I had meant that, I'd have to say "No, not really, I can't back
that up"  (Dr Evil line)
