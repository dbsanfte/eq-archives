It might have been a bit reactionary, but I was getting pretty tired of
guildchat being little more than "twink talk." (Level07_guildmember says to
the guild, "I just got my jboots!")

Having just earned my Burning Rapier (I did have help on the big kills, but
I was there for every single step), I was fed up with the guild's support of
some twinkling rouge (yes, 'rouge') getting everybody else to do his quest.
One 40+ pulled the Hemo mob in MM right to the zone line for him to loot it;
someone else did the same for Lynada in SolA. And so on. This was just a
single example, but the one that got me most because he started the quest
*because* I'd done it.
Rampant powerlevelling (babysitting). Etcetera.

It seems that I was the only one in my guild who was verbalizing a
preference to earning as much as possible at my own level.

I'm not against a little twinking here and there. I just can't stand to hear
someone's Alt who is 15th bragging about their FBSS that their primary got
for them, or something else that they had virtually no part in earning.
If you're a twink - fine - just shut up about it.
