Bits I found interesting in Kavhok's long post:

"Your AC cap was lowered. That was absolutely and unequivocally a
nerf. I didn't mean in any way to imply otherwise."

and

"The problem was that the average plate-equipped warriors and
knights had barely any lead on monks in mitigation, due to the
monk bonus, but the monk still had the lead in evasion. Contrary
to popular belief, this is what prompted the nerf to monk
mitigation, NOT high-end monks being rampage tanks."
