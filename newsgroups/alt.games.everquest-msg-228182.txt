It's a strategy game that Sony is trying to use to capitalize on the
Everquest name.  Basically, it's a knockoff of Warcraft III from
Blizzard Entertainment.  I'm sure the game is fun but it is not the
same type of game that Everquest is...far from it.   

Sony is going to pimp out the Everquest nomenclature as much as they
can.  Let's just hope the games are good and worthy of the name.
From what I've seen so far, Lords of Everquest is a good game but I
wouldn't pay $50 for it.   It'll be in the bargain bins in a month or
two.
