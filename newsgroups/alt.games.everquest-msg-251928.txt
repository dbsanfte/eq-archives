The Cray Inc. X1.

System parameters:

Model				Cray X1
Clock cycle			800 MHz

Theor. peak performance:
Per Proc. (64 bits) 		3.2/12.8 Gflop/s
Maximal 			819 Gflop/s
Memory 				<= 1 TB
No. of processors 		16--64 (MSP, see below)

Memory bandwidth:
Memory-Cache 			34.1 GB/s
Cache-CPU			76.8 GB/s

So... its an 800MHz cpu with a theoretical peak performance of 12.8 
gflops. Period. You don't even have a teraflop when you have the maximum 
number (64) of them in the cabinet; you only hit a theoretical 819 
gflops (or 0.82 tflops). (You can break a tflop with multiple 
cabinets... but now we're looking at 128+ cpus...)

This information is confirmed via the official Cray X1 product sheet:

http://www.cray.com/products/systems/x1/CrayX1ProductSheet_pdfonly.pdf

See Page 2 of the PDF.

Your argument that a cray x1 cpu runs tflops is absurd. If you feel 
compelled to reply at least have the decency to admit you were mistaken.

Now, emulation of a single threaded x86 linear algorithm (ie EQ) is not 
parallizable, so even if you have 128 CPUs all the work is still going 
to be done on just one of them with a peak theoretical processing power 
of 12.8 gflops. (And doing emulation has little to do with flops... so 
you aren't likely to reach anywhere near that peak performance either.)
