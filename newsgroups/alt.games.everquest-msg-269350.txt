Correct.

It appears that your account has an "evil" shared space and "good" shared
space...so if you leave things in one shared space then betray, you
actually can't get to those. I betrayed to Qeynos and
suddenly...oops...can't see my old shared stuff anymore. :P So be sure to
get things you need out of your shared bank before you betray.
