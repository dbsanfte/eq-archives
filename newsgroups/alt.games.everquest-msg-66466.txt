I keep reading and hearing from various monks about a weight limit of 15 for
monks less than level 60 and a weight of 17 for level 60's.

I don't understand this because as long as my weight
stays under the max (like 65 or so), my DEX, AGI, and STA aren't affected.

Is there a web site that describes how this works?  I looked around at
www.monkly-business.com and didn't find anything.

Thanks in advance.
