well we never really got "attacked" by the germans...our not so bright
goverment at that time cooperated with the germans for a few years, so
we were in fact "liberated" pretty much the same way austria was, but
following a series of events in late '41 the cooperation-politic was
trashed and the danish resistance grew big (underground of course)

in other words: yes most danes sat around singing folk songs hehe,
well we lost 22 (iirc) soldiers who refused to just let the germans
walk into our country...


and that ends today's lesson in danish history ;)
