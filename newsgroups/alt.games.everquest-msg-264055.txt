Paladins may be useful, but hardly necessary in any LDONs.  I've done 
that one with a ranger tank and two shaman for slowing/healing.  I've 
done BoT courtyard with me healing/slowing, Paladin tanking/healing, and 
4 DPS classes.  There are situations where a particular class is pretty 
much required, most of the time, you can get by with a variety of 
options.

People found ways around the locked door in CoM a long time ago, been 
done many times with no rogue.

You don't need the shaman to be there to use the potions...

I frequently xp with a druid as the main healer, and believe me, they are 
quite up to the task.  Elemental zones, WoS, lesser PoP zones.  In the 
easier zones, I am quite up to the task of slowing and healing as a 
shaman, and my heals are even more pitiful than druid heals.

If I am looking for a healer, I first check to see if any of my 
guildies/friends is available, druid or cleric, doesn't much matter, 
then, if we feel that a shaman is not up to the task, resort to finding 
someone outside the guild that is LFG.

We use monks almost exclusively for pulling for raids, and for xp groups, 
they can do well as pullers, and they work well as yet another DPS class 
as well.

To me at least, the game is much more about the social aspect, I always 
much prefer hanging out with friends, even if it makes for a less than 
optimal group.
