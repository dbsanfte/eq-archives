Yes. And for most of June and July, 208, there was a 54 day free
thing for returning players. The defiant armor items still drop,
they are better than cultural until level 70. Hot zones just
changed. Oh, the hot zones during the 54 day promo got an
additional 35 percent exp bonus. Gone now. See the soe forums for
details.

]Is EQ 1 or 2 better?

Up to you.

]If not are there any games out there that have the equivalent of
]enchanter charm soloing?

No idea.
