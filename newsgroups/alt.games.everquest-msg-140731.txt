I consider myself to be easy-going as far as rules go.  I can shrug off vendor
names, actually I think it is totally "in character" in a lot of cases to have
a name like TailorMade.... (if you are selling hand made clothes or stacks of
padding...)
On the other hand if I find a player's name offensive "in game" I simply ignore
them.  The same way I ignore strangers hailing me with "SOW PLZ".  (Note for
strangers:  Put a few plat in the trade window before you say "SOW PLZ".  I
won't take the money if I don't sow ya, and if you REALLLLY want sow bad enough
to be a begger you won't mind paying for it).
The game is what you make it.  If someone decides to jump my camp I petition
them, then leave the zone.  I play the game to relax.  When a GM / guide
contacts me I tell them the story, I make sure that player is "in their files".
 If they are guildies I note their name and send an Email to the guild leader. 

I honestly think alot of the "idiots" are idiots on purpose.  I deal with them
every day in real life, all day long.  I don't have time for them "in game".
