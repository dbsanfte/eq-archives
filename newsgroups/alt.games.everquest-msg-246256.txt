Just hit PrintScreen on your keyboard.  I actually changed it to the EQ
default on my keyboard.  =)

I was so surprised about screenshots because they happen instantly.  I'm so
used to the EQ habit of freezing my game for a few seconds until the
screenshot was generated.  There is no noticeable pause at all, leading me
to think that the screenshot had not in fact happened.  I kept hitting the
screenshot key over and over again until I finally quit the game, looked in
the screenshot folder, and saw about a dozen images sitting there.  =)
