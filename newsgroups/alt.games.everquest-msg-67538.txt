Druid, Necro, Bard and Enchanter, in that order. Well, in fact, I don't
really play the enchanter much anymore, too hard for me. And yes, I
fully well know I'll be irrelevant in the end game; that's the price I
pay for the fact that I can play at my own rythm, grouping when I want
and soloing when I feel like it, and still get decent XP.
