My work environment consists of a combination metalshop/forge, my music 
comes from a pair of industrial strength ear protectors with a built in 
radio.  When I get bored with one station's loop I switch to another, 
but I dont have any way to feed in anything from an external source of 
my own choosing.  Well, I suppose I -could- wire together a small local 
broadcast and run that off a tape deck or something with a long cable... 
any tape deck/CD player actually inside the shop succumbs to the 
vibrations, heavy duty magnetic fields, 2000 degree heat range, and 
general layers of metal dust within a month.

I also looked into an MP3player (no moving parts) and those little ear 
buds, but it turns out they annoy me, sticking in my ears like that... 
and I'm not so sure the player would last all that long either.  The 
earphone/safety gear things seem to be holding up well, two years so 
far, but they are way up there on top of my head instead of down on my 
waist in the stream of sparks.

None of which has any bearing on walking into a Sears or thru the mall 
or worse, contemplating actually -working- in an environment like that!

Nah, I'd rather keep making swords for a living.
