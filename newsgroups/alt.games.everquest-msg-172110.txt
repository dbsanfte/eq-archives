My God.  What I could have done with those spells at level 1.  Christ, I'd
kill for them now, and I'm level 30.  And they're supposed to be BST spells.
I'm tempted to assume that either Magelo is just wrong about these spells (I
can't believe Sony would offer such unbelievable spells for a lvl 1), or
they are insanely hard to get.  I mean, insanely, as in you need 10 lvl 60+
to get them.  So... my question is, does anyone know anything about any of
these three spells, and if so, what do I have to do to get them???
