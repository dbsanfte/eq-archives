-once you hit lv24 then to lv34 give your pets two
-summoned daggers as they need them to dual hit.

Why do people insist on spreading this myth?  Magician pets automatically
dual wield from level 24, no weapons required.  sometimes if you get lucky
and get a high level 20 pet it will dual wield as well.  Necromancers pets
are the only ones that require weapons to dual wield until lvl 29 then they
dual automatically as well.

-air pets have the fewest hit points

    Not true either.  Fire pets have the fewest hit points because they have
that incredible damage shield, which is always better than the current one
you will have.  But I completely agree that air pets in a mainly melee group
will be the best bet everytime, because of the stun spell, although brief,
with lots of meleers hitting the mob it'll take a lot of damage and not be
able to return it, which makes a big difference when the mobs start hitting
for 80's and 90's.

Everything else was pretty much right on though.  Would just like to add
that you can make a hotkey for the "/pet report health" command and it will
tell you what percentage of hitpoints your pet has left, I find that more
useful than switching targets since sometimes re-aquiring the mob as your
target can be a pain.
Also remember that if you group, damage shields are your most efficient way
of dealing damage (other than your pet of course).  I always concentrated on
getting the main tank damage shielded, and then sending in pet, and then
nuke if necessary (usually I would just so I didn't get too bored).  The
rest of the fight I would spend meditating and I had usually replaced the
mana I had used before the next pull.

Also remember that the levels right before you get new spells are always
very tough for a mage, moreso than any other caster because that's when your
pets are the weakest.  It's a little slower going, but get a group for those
levels, or save up items for a quest that gives decent xp and use them all
during those levels, to shorten the time you spend there.  I skipped level 7
altogether with gnoll fangs in Qeynos, I had saved them all until then,
handed them in and ding, I was level 8.  I think they've changed the amount
of xp you get from that quest now, but every little bit helps.
Just be patient with your mage.  I got very frustrated in the high teens,
and almost deleted him.  But then once I hit level 20 I felt that I wasnt a
weakling anymore.  The 20's with my mage were the fastest leveling I'd seen
of any of my characters.  Your pets finally have enough hitpoints to tank a
little while, and your spells do some decent damage.  Then after level 39
your pets become true weapons, and your spells do awesome damage.  Just be
patient, you'll enjoy the results, trust me.
