Load up your L44/49 regen/skin/damage shield.

Some newbie area to 8
Paludal to 26
SolA to 32
SolB or LG to 42
Hole to 46

Load up your full power buffs and nukes.

PoN (quadding with paladin grouped) or PoD to 60
HoH kiting to 65

Should take you about a week if you know what you're doing to 60, and
another week to 65. Maybe less.

You won't know jack shit about being a paladin at the end of it and
you'll probably wipe out the first five groups you try to tank for,
but you'll be L65. For what its worth.

 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
