Yes they are!  Well, probably not as much as warrior types but I *have* been
asked how many AAs I have and how much FT by someone I was NOT in a group with.
 A total of 3 times.   I'll tell them but I always ask WHY?  So far I've never
been interested in the group anyway :)

I usually prefer to think that the GL knows *exactly* what kind of cleric he
requires and honestly, if I'm not going to be able to keep up I'd just as soon
*not* get the invite.  If I'm going to bog the group down we are all going to
be unhappy.  Especially me.

I am really torn on this subject.  I'll be happily clericing along in a group
having no problem keeping the MT healed and having plenty of mana left over for
some stuns and nukes.  Then we change MT and I'm casting 3 CH each mob and
getting agro and all the sudden it becomes real work.  *NOT* that I mind real
work... I try to see it as a learning experience about using mana effectively /
efficiently.
A couple of times said Paper Tank has made a comment about the "cleric not
keeping up".  That really makes my day :)  But then we also had a Paper Tank
say that *NO ONE* in the group was carrying their load :)))))  Whatever!!!!

I think it borders on rude unless it is followed by an explanation:  "FT / Mana
pool / AAs please?  I am putting together a VXED group?"    
You could always ask the OTHER person the same thing before responding.  Do a
/who all Rudeguy and then say whats your mana pool?  how many aas you got?  Who
else is in the group?  Does the wizard have manaburn?  Do you have a good bard
puller?  Is there a chanter in the group?
*VEG*.  Maybe a little reverse psychology would work...
