Granted. I'd say it's a safe enough assumption though. Only the most jaded 
could assume that they don't do some analysis before making any changes or 
that they make them based purely on one small segment of the game 
population. That would be just silly.

Personally, I thought the monk mitigation nerf made sense. They both deal 
and avoid damage like crazy, but when they *do* get hit, they *potentially* 
get hit hard due to their wearling light to no armor and over-commitment on 
deadly strikes. I never thought monks should be suitable tanks for any 
length of time, but that *is* just my own opinion from a rp perspective.
