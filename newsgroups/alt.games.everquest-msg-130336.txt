    Yes, it would. A normal, unassisted CH is actually a heal for 10000
points. There are mob debuffs that can change how much one heals for - one
curse, Balance, cuts in four the amount a heal lands for on the Balanced
person. My guild's main tanks have 7000+ HPs - a 2500 point CH is far from a
complete heal. Abilities like Healing Gift and Healing Adept, which do
increase the amount for which CH heals, are useful in situations like that.
