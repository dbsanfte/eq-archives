Money issue? When I'm clocking  100 plat plus an hour and one blue?  And you
expect an offer of 20 plat for a port, losing the camp worth my time?  You want
to come and sit by my  until I'm medding after a fight for a Sow? Fine. I'll
buff you. I never charge for buffs BTW. But you may have to wait five minutes.
I agree a low level buff is not such a big deal. So sit down in the corner
nearby and I'll buff you when I'm finished doing what I was doing when YOU
interrupted ME.

Point is friend I owe you not. I try to respond politely but, I am not
obligated to tell you why I can't which you may interpret as a won't. That
seems to be a personal problem.

Each class was created with specific strong and weak points. To a Duid, mana is
all important. He can't melee and live (very long). He does many things well
but he excels at nothing.  He is not really actively recruited into high level
groups unless it's within his guild.

So if you want to wait that five minutes I'll be glad to SoW you. Not many
(none actually) ever has been willing to wait.
