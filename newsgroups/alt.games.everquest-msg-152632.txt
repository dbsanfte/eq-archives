EQW (EQWindows)

www.eqwindows.com I believe

Use at your own risk, as it's technically against the EULA you sign on
the way into the game.

(DISCLAIMER: I have never used EQW, nor to I intend to at any point in
the future. Neither am I endorsing the product, nor encouraging it's
use. I am merely pointing out it's existence)

That said, I've never known a banning based solely on using EQW. In
fact, I believe VI staff have been heard off record, saying they use it
too, heh.

It's not a malicious program, but could be used to facilitate memory
hacks and the like to effect gameplay, which is why I think VI don't go
ahead and endorse it. The hacks are out there, and people do use them
(and get banned), just VI don't want them to be made too easy to use
