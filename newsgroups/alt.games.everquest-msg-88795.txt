Not quite, but almost. As a pair for outdoors hunting they are about
the best there is. Assuming you both know your classes well and do not
over-reach yourselves you are gonna have all kinds of fun.

Speaking as a lvl 56 necro I can say that the only class that gives
the druid a run for their money is a high level shaman who knows their
stuff. Other necros I have met like other types of partners, but for
me I'll take the Druid. Tracking, Regen, Evacs, SoW, Regen, Harmony,
Root, Snare, (did I mention Regen yet?)...
