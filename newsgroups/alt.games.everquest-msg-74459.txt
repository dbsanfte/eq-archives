They pretty much gave them barbarian faction. My shaman vah shir, even
though godless like all vah shir, has the exact barbarian shaman of
the tribunal faction to halas. Like she is amiable to shaman guild,
indiff to rest. They also have the same barbarian like faction with
druids in surefall, apprehensive to glower to some (same with rings)

They are kos to Evils (including the overthere area) and are fine in
BB, FV, etc. Oddly enough they are only apprehensive to east freep
sewers and indiff to evil opal dark briar, they are glower dubious at
worst there, that being with the dark elf cleric lady (so you can do
the good bone chip/beetle eye quest with xelha down there for good xp)

I think they are KOS to bertox faction in QEYNOS(that necro guy and
people in qeynos sewer) but are fine in all of the regular qeynos.
Here again their factions are just like a barbarian. It really seems
like they just took barbs and dressed them up in kitty suits, gave
them infravision and safe fall and sneak.
