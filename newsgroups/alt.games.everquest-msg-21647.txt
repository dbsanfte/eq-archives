So, the Iksar Berserker Club sounds like a good weapon for my Cleric.  So
off I go to Kurn's Tower to pull it from the depths.  I've read some
conflicting reports on How to catch the elusive Undead Jester, but most seem
to agree on one thing:  It's a rare drop off a rare spawn.  Has anyone here
actually had a hand in camping this critter?  Ant recommendations?  I've
already given out about 50pp in FS weapons, armor, and small coin to
newbs/lowbs because I can't sell to the F.O.B. merchants ( only one has been
willing to bank for me, the others just want free stuff and know I'll drop
it eventually ).  The method I'm using is killing the hallway spawn between
the stables and the drop-room (with hole in the back, leading to caves).
Spawns pops every 20 minutes like clockwork, and once was  the Jester...but
the bastard had a FS sword on him...
Thanks much for any advise.
