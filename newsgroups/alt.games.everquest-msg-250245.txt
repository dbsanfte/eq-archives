Let's be quite plain about this ... you are wrong about the purpose of
the summit.  Here is Smedley's letter again:

Hello Norrath! 
I wanted to announce that we've decided to push Omens of War back to
Late August in order to give the EQ team time to respond to important
issues that the EverQuest community is raising (specifically including
the issues with Gates of Discord). We've heard some concerns from
within the community that we feel are important enough to push back our
next expansion and spend time fixing the problems you have brought to
our attention. At the end of the day, we work for you and it's
important for us to demonstrate that we both understand and appreciate
that. Hello Norrath!

at SOE for a day to have a direct dialog with the development team
about issues that are important to the EverQuest community as a whole.
We've already sent out the invitations and are making all the
arrangements. In addition, our EQ community managers will be coming up
with a list of issues raised on the message boards so that we can come
back to you with a specific list of things we're going to address.
I'm sorry if you feel we haven't been listening and reacting
appropriately. We do our best to balance all of the needs and concerns
you raise along with expanding Norrath and giving you new and wonderful
things to do in EverQuest, but we do make mistakes. We've heard you
loud and clear.
We have many things planned for EverQuest over the upcoming years, and
our goal is to keep you happily playing EverQuest for a long time to
come. The best way for us to do that is by first and foremost listening
to you.

President, Sony Online Entertainment

You are wrong here again the list came right at the end of the day
after a meeting of all the SOE staff on things they could fix quickly.
Re-read the newsgroups again. In particular this one:

Yes they did, so why did they only announce changes for uber-guilds and
players ... because they were ill-prepared and do not listen to their
fora .. we will see if they have any more summits.

I cannot believe how naive you are.  The SOE Forums have been in
existence for a number of years and all of the issues that were
presented to them at the summit have been the topic of many discussions
on the fora in that time.. Have they listened in the past .. in a word
NO.  Will they listen now ... the only reason they will is that they
are bleeding from loss of players.

There has never been fighting with SOE .. they have always been right
.. just ask them.  Players are only puemmlling SOE into submission by
leaving and this summit did nothing to stem the tide.

Pity they didn't have a few brains and ask the right people along in
the first place.
