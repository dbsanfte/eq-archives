Holy crap! I've been told, haven't I?! Gimme a break. You're just another 
putz who comes here to act like you wouldn't have the balls to in real 
life. I went through the new posts this morning and there were several from 
you - mostly abrasive crap like this has been.

If I'd had any idea that you wouldn't recognize it for what it was, I would 
have quoted it, so here it is:

Sounds awful darned opinionated and close-minded to me.

My point is no, it's *not* that rare. You imply here that the most minor of 
variations from your ideas of correct groups can only result in grave 
misfortune.

That's not exactly your example of an extra warrior, though.

Hey, I can't stand the whole chatroom feel of EQ sometimes. I will give you 
this though, you're skilled with the rhetoric. : /
