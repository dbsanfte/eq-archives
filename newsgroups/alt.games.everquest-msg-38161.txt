1).  Where is this "Fippy's" religion break down of religion on Sullon Zek?
I'd be very interested in seeing that.

2).  I don't think it will affect the 'hop on the moment the patch is
finished' rush..... from my personal experience, people figure out how long
the patch is supposed to take, then get onto their login screens 30 minutes
early, and keep hitting 'connect' until they're on.  Can't even see
population of the servers screen until the patch is finished.

Not unless you're talking about when they work on one or two servers at a
time.  In that case, they'll still have it listed as whether it is 'up' or
'down' anyway.
