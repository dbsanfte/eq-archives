Derv Rings work - either off Dervs in the zone or buying for 1 gold off
n00bs -  as does giving [some amount of] gold to the caster merchant who
stands directly behind Ortallius.  Killing Ortallius gives positive
Shadowed Men faction so I presume doing the reverse would help repair
faction damage although it's been aeons since I killed any.

How important Sol Ro faction is would depend on your class, my Necro and
Shaman never seemed to have any need of it.
