Well, I disagree on this... my monk is rather twinked... nothing uber
but he has better stuff than alot of monk's and almost all his skills
are maxed out....  except instill doubt, mend, sneak....
2hb, 1hb, h2h, dodge, defense, offense, are all right at the fringe of
being maxed or maxed.  FD is right up there with them as well.

It really is all in how you play... I mostly solo with him, so that
does allow him to keep building those skills.
