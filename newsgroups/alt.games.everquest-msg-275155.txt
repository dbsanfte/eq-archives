Inserting the jewel into the statue grants access to an instanced
zone, but as it requires three people and I've never found two more
people interested in going there, I don't know what's inside.  I'm
really looking forward to the patch removing the group requirement for
these zones, I've done access quests for at least five zones that I
outlevelled before I could convince anyone to go there.
