Not so.  Your unstated premise is that time is experienced by the
creator in the same fashion as us.  If, instead, you assume an
existence outside of time (seems reasonable to me, seeing as time
is integral to the created time-space in which we exist) then it
is not paradoxical for the creator to set the conditions of and
call into being our existence (omnipotence), and be aware of the
totality of that existence (omniscience), and have those two be
unrelated by what we know as time.  The anti- free will position
(determinism) presumes foreknowledge, and that in turn presumes
that the creator is experiencing time as we do (else the "fore"
in foreknowledge is nonsensical).  The arguments for determinism
lose all force and meaning if you rob them of their unwarranted
presumption that the creator is bound by time.

Only if your god is anthropomorphic.  Personally, I believe that

God created us, not the other way around.
