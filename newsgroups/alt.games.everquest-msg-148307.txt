I'm assuming that you got the trophy that summons a no-rent bag.  I'm going
to tell you something cool that I didn't know about until my wife clued me
in.  It was a DOH! moment.

Summon one of those no-rent bags.

Give it to the gnome on the second-floor balcony of that building in the
bazaar between the banks.

He'll give you a 100% weight-reducing bag that's permanent.  Lore, alas, or
you could get more, but it's FREE.

As to what I do for other players, not much.  I generally just use it to
make resist gear for guildmates and friends.  There are so many GM jewelers
out there that it's hard to make money at it.

If combat means living in a ditch, females have biological problems staying
in a ditch for thirty days because they get infections and they don't have
upper body strength. I mean, some do, but they're relatively rare. On the
other hand, men are basically little piglets, you drop them in the ditch,
they roll around in it, doesn't matter, you know. These things are very
real. On the other hand, if combat means being on an Aegis-class cruiser
managing the computer controls for twelve ships and their rockets, a female
may be again dramatically better than a male who gets very, very frustrated
sitting in a chair all the time because males are biologically driven to go
out and hunt giraffes."
