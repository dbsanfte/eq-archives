I am interested in a game similiar to EQ.  I upgraded to recommended 512 MB,
Gforce 2, Win XP with 8.1. It would appear that EQ is incompatable with my
machine. It adds a mouse pointer and crashes when you select a character and
try to play. Until EQ gets it right - what would others recommend? I would
guess that the drivers and hardware will catch up to EQ sometime early next
year. Until then I am interested in playing something similiar  either on
line or off. I like the spell casting like wizards etc. Thanks.
Jim
