Yeah, but due to player behavior Verant (like the players) have
adopted other players as a means for players to get transportation via
TPS (even to the point of giving wizards more TL's, which was pretty
obvious...) instead of designing it in. They even recently made the
kunark Tp's EJ and Skyfire so you could cast them from anywhere rather
than the old way of having to gate to combines, run with the person to
karnor's and evac them. Guess how many people I ported to Ej or
Skyfire who asked the old way? I ported about zero. The new way I have
ported several and am even much more likely to port someone in my
guild wanting one to those places. 

So I think Verant has started to get the point that depending on other
players for your CS is not really working. People playing the game are
often too busy to stop and move other people playing the game around
the world faster for little or no reward. 
Yet said people are making the people getting ported feel better about
the way that Everquest works in general = Customer Service above
and beyond actual game design. I think that if all of us refused to
port except for the people in our groups we were playing with, Verant
would have changed such things and had firepots and what not long ago.
Players taking up the slack for poor design may have made things take
much longer, clerics giving resses to strangers is sort of similar
since without that happening so much people may have complained to the
point where xp loss was lower especially in the 50's.

It wasn't such a huge concern with just old EQ but is with kunark and
velious, especially since their boat rides are a ton longer. Seems to
me that Verant, like I and many people did, figured that group
teleports were for your group pretty much and not a means of
transportation. It was players who started to make that different
soliciting rides and other players
who asked for them. Verant may have been going to put the firepots
in you saw in cities like neriak for players then saw that the problem
was taking care of itself. Now it is kind of back to square one.

I heard both of these things that the luclin or whatever market will
be within 3 zones of any zone and that players will be able to get to
luclin from whatever kind of tp or something (unassisted by other
players it sounded like)
