The one near the HG area is a level 40 enchanter, and bards, sks, and 
shammies all get to play with him getting epic drops.  You're not supposed 
to play with him, but you have to kill all the drakes that spawn near him, 
and you almost alwasy aggro him at least once.  He's fast too, so if 
you're hunting in the area, either make sure you have SoW or better on, or 
just stay off of his hill.  Nothing like getting stunned, then charmed, 
then whatever nukes enchanters use.
The other one is all the way in the extreme northeast corner of the zone, 
above the feeroot zone line.  He is also an enchanter, and probably casts 
the same spells, but I've never aggrod him.  Many people, even level 60, 
don't know that he exists.  When a friend killed him pre-kunark, as far as 
he could tell, he was the first on the server to do so.  He's probably 
trivial for a 45ish druid or necro to kill now though
