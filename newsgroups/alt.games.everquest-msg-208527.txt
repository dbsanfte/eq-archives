Last night Rakyn and I finally approached the East Wing of Charasis.  I
have had enough practice with this zone to know where to stand to pull
singles in the other three wings, I just did not know about level based
aggro.  

And despite the nay-sayers on this ng *wink*, I had very little difficulty
pulling singles (for the most part) at level 61.  I wanted to share my
experiences so that others coudl benefit somewhat.  Here was my strategy:

1. zone in and kill the two center wanderers

2. husband pulled golems from north and east wing using slow (we've always
been able to get these single)

3. wait for the east wing wanderer to path to the edge of the east wing,
and pull that as well

4. use the levitate/sow trick from the north door firepot to get to the
east wing ledge

5. at this point I was curious about the Mortiferous Golem that is on the
other side of the one-way wall from east wing.  I left RAk on the ledge
and went to the wall, walked back and forth, sad down, etc...could not
aggro him.  He did not appear during two seperate clearings of the first
room of four, so either I was lucky, or my aggro radius was not big enough
to snag him.

6. Facing the room with the four mobs, I targetted the closest right mob,
splatted myself against the wall on the left side of the archway to that
room, and nudged towards the door until I could cast on him.  As soon as
snare landed, I backed up.  Voila, single.  Next I grabbed back right,
then front left, then back left.  Was able to get a single every
time.  Was careful to position myself and pet so that we did not kick the
mob towards the 4-mob room.

7. Get a tinkered whatsitcalled with charges of eye of zoom and send it
through the one way door.  Wait until there is only one wanderer.  

8. Jump through wall and head hard left to hug up against the
wall.  You can ctually get here with no wanderers, but there are at least
3 wanderers that can come this far (I think), so no point in trying to
avoid them.  Before you finish of the first a second will probably
arrive.  We just slowed and wacked until the flow of mobs stopped, and
then pulled any that didn't wander close enough to aggro.  

9. Go around the first bend, pull the static spawn.  Pull static spawn
past broken wall (near pit trap). ETc etc.  We were always careful to stay
in a previously cleared area as our "safe spot", and only moved forward
when we were certain we had pulled all wanderers that were ahead of us.

The exception
--------------

One mob that I encountered that I could *not* pull single were Undertaker
Skeletons.  I did not hunt my way to Dru's room, but rather the "H" shaped
place to get a groundspawn for a friend, so I do not know how common these
mobs are in the three large rooms we have not pulled yet.  I hope to find
out tonight.

I have not yet pulled Mortiferous Protectors, which I assume will not come
single, nor Mortiferous Golems, which I think are a 50/50 chance.  

Summary for fighting up to the room with the Mandala 
----------------------------------------------------

So my general advice to someone lvl 61 trying to pull in east wing is that
you should confirm that you can pull single from south wing, so you know
you have the tactics right, and if you see a single undertaker skeleton
(or other higher level mob) ina bunch, grab it first...it's lower level
buddies will probably not aggro).

If you are responsible for root parking in the east wing, do so without a
DS, as most of the mobs can summon.  A DS might not do enough damage to
allow them to summon, but don't take your chances.  If you are a
ranger/druid, consider using root with a lower DD component.

I always pulled with either snare or jolt.  (Have a habit of forgetting to
buy arrows...I need to get EQ just so I have arrows on me.)

Will report back with more if we get a chance to try the other rooms in
this place.  The big question is whether we can take on Drusella.  I have
no worries about her alone, but I know I can't pull her single. The
question is whether I can pull enough of the mobs in her room in doubles
so that when I do pull her, there are only 1-2 adds, rather than
5-6.
