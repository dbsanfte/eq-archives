Ummm, you basically said that you had to beg and wait to go on
anything high end.  If they're not letting you come unless you beg,
they're excluding you.

Because level is very important in resists and aggro.  A 60 druid
stand right under a mob, resisting AEs and healing like mad.  A 50
cleric in that same situation is going to be beaten up with AE and
summoned and killed.

Well, that might be when I invite you, but my guild druids, and
friends are snatched up immediately.  In fact, the only time I'm not
going to grab a druid for a group is if I already have one and the
group is already very unbalanced.

There aren't that many high-level shaman.  The ones that we do have
are busy buffing and slowing and such.  Now with mass group buff it's
not quite as much of a manasink, but they're still pretty busy.  
Maybe if you whined less and touted your upside more, you wouldn't sit
in the 'whining idiot who never gets groups' filter so much.
