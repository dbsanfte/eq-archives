Hi.

My shaman is a barb who recently traveled from Halas with some assistance
from a friend.  (lvl 5).  I went up to Luclin (Shadowhaven) and lo and
behold the trainer is apprehensive to me and refuses to train me.  Isn't
this a little stupid?  Where else can I get trained?  I know I could travel
to Shar Val if I get YET ANOTHER escort or at least a good invis.  Any other
shaman trainers?  Failing that, how can a lvl 5 barb shaman even hope to
raise my faction?  Don't apprehensive people sell to you?  Why won't they
train me?

My bard just learned percussion, lvl 5, but cannot equip the drum.  Why not?
Is there some special thing you need to have to use a drum?  That makes no
sense either.

I'm getting pretty disgusted with both of these characters.  Help much
appreciated.
