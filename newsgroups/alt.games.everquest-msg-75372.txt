You may have spell casting lag form the other members, or the mobs.
Do this command set-

/showspelleffects off
/serverfilter on

Also, turn down particle effects to low, Double/single sky to none (in
display), and turn off damage shield and other peoples damage (In chat
filter).   It will help alot with battle lag, especially on raids.
