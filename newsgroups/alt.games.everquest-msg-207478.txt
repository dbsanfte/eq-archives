You've clearly made the comparison between the OP and real life people who
put little value on "gifts from strangers (or institutions IRL)"  The
original poster only referred to his *IN GAME* experience.  It looked to me
that you were having trouble separating the two.

Nice.  When your point is weak, resort to namecalling and sarcasm.  It's
clear that I simply defined a term you didn't seem to grasp.  Let me give
you a reference...the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language:
Fourth Edition (2000) - human nature:  The sum of qualities and traits
shared by all humans.

You should be at least partially agreeing with my point instead of invoking
the Lord God Almighty because you yourself said, "That is such a classic
comment on how most people value gifts..."  It seems you believe there is a
common trait there, too....   :)

I honestly have no idea what you are trying to ascribe to me with that mess
of a response.

You tried to make a clear connection between an *imaginary game world* and
RL.  I simply called you on the absurdity of it.  You can believe that
people who work for their charity gifts in real life value them more (that's
a commonly accepted idea), but to try to tie that in to Horatio's adventure
will get you laughed out of whatever Congressional committee you're
testifying to on that issue.

Your assertion that what Horatio did with his virtual equipment in EQ is
somehow a comment on the real world is just as silly as asserting that what
my character did with a weapon in EQ (i.e., bury it in someone's abdomen) is
a comment on society.  Think about it.

I don't think anyone will forget their first such trip.  That's what drew me
to this thread.  Norrath seemed was so big and magical then.  Heck, it still
holds frequent surprises for me.  :)

Kaev, you simply seemed to me to be comparing a small detail of his story to
a sad fact of human society.  Many people who have played this game for any
length of time have had "spells" of getting the virtual and real worlds, if
even for a brief moment, entwined in their mind.  It is a common fallacy.
Most people catch themselves, and they put the game back into perspective.
How players direct their characters to behave in a game has no correlation
to how people behave in the world, with all due respect to Sen. Lieberman,
Tipper Gore, et. al.  That's the only point I'm trying to make here.  Now,
I'm going to play some Everquest.

Mort
