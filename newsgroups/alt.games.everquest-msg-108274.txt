Agree hot key.  A twist on that is the group does not know what the
necro is thinking.  I will save the enchater the burden of putting
clarity on me every 5mins. I will life tap some damage, I will take
away some of the mobs AC, strenght and ablity to regen fast.
Burns me up to get a heal when I have 3 bubs of health.  It used there
mana and takes away the need for a life tap.
