Spell loadouts are a very subjective thing.  I'd mem Clarity and Alacrity
only when needed.  CotSM doesn't seem to have that much of an effect on
NPCs, so I'd drop that, too.  Use Tepid Deeds and Listless Power only if you
don't have a shaman in your group.  Their spells in those lines are better
than ours.  The only thing you're missing is the Color Shift/Flux/Whatever
AE stun spell you have at that level.  If you can, mem your current one,
plus the one you got before it.  Having two stuns up can save your bacon.

My loadout at 56 is:
Tash
Theft of Thought
Mez
Stun #1
Stun #2 (or AOE mez, but usually stun)
Swap #1 (a nuke if I'm alone)
Swap #2 (usually clarity)
Gate

The first 4 spells are ALWAYS up.  Always.  So is Gate.  The others I swap
in and out depending on circumstances.  On large raids, for example, I keep
haste and clarity up all the time because they're in high demand.

> Secondly, which is the best mez, Mez or Enthrall?

Enthrall lasts longer, but takes more mana.  When I got a mez upgrade, I
used the new one.

How much money do you have?

Cazic-Thule.  But I understand that it's pretty empty now...
