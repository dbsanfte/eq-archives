Some quest items are found on the ground, and are nodrop. I got some kind of
scepter in High Hold Keep when i was swimming around looking for the smugglers
lair, so i could help another druid camp Dyllan Starshine.
Think the other items for that quest are nodrop too, a wizard from guild did the
quest, am pretty sure she would have gotten someone to get the items if she
could, some of them was in bad places (Neriak, lower guk. Not good places for a
leve 28 good race wizard).

Am not sure, but think that the quest swords in the Orc camps in EC are nodrop
too.
