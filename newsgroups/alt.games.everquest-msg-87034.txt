Here's an item to add to your parser if you would like.

We like giving a boobie prize for the person who gets summoned the most
during Kael Arena raids. It's a subtle hint that these folks need to
work on aggro management.

You will not evade me Tiru! can be pretty easy to spot. I'd like to know
how many times each person got summoned for the raids. Usually I
manually look.
