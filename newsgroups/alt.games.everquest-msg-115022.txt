the other day, being short if funds due to trades skills, my lv40
enchanter sold his stein and went rounding up the pieces for a new one.
All went well till i visited Clurg in Oggok, in illusion Ogre he cons
dubious, not a problem i thought, cast benevolence (Faction increase
buf) and go through the text for quest. Now on the last line of the
text, where you normally get the quest, he mutters something about me
being brave, calls me an enemy of oggok and says i better leave while i
can.

Well I was shocked, imagine an ogre speaking like that to a hansome &
powerful gnome enchanter.

Any way checked the con, and to my amazwement he was still dubious.
Triedboth DE and Ogre illusions, whith both alliance and benevolence,
same results the faction buff doesn't seem to work on clurg any more.
Tried it on other npcs in oggok and other zones and works ok, so either
Clurg is no longer affected by the spell or is bugged.

Anyone have any info on this, or tried the quest lately ?
I have done it many times in the past and am annoyed thet my enchanter
is now steinless.
