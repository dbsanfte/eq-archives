Obviously it's situational.  We have a 60SK in the guild who has become the 
late-night pull whore.  He's got Deathpeace, and we abuse him for it.  Not sure 
where it dropped, but my GM LOVES pulling with him (GM is 60 necro, most skilled 
puller I've seen.)
Also, how much mana do you think an SK needs?  They have at least C3 and bard AE 
manasong on at all times EXCEPT when actively pulling.  It only costs 120 mana 
(and I just checked stats on a 60SK with decent gear, 3000+ mana), and drops off 
of Lodizal, some PoG mobs, and 59-60 Skyshrine, among other mobs.

You are absolutely right that monks are better pullers overall, and stonestance 
can be used almost every pull by level 60.  SKs have the same defensive skill, 
lower riposte, and have parry rather than dodge.  I suspect they take a bit more 
damage overall, but have higher AC, and more raw HP.

Damn, your buffers must hate that, especially since the group versions of most 
buffs are better than the single target version.  Or do all of your buffers have 
MGB already?

Yep.  Basically, unless I lag and miss the ENRAGED message, I generally make it 
through almost any raid without taking damage, unless the MA dies.

I know, but we're still working on getting all plate classes outfitted in Kael 
quest armor.  We're dropping Vindi, but can't really kill our Kael faction until 
we have everyone outfitted.  We've also been working SoL mobs, and finding the 
risk/reward to be very, very nice.  Doomshade and Rumblecrush aren't pushovers, 
but they aren't that difficult either.
