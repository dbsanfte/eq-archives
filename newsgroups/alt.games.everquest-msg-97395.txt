I do consider myself lucky, it was a lvl 46 wizard hanging out at Felwithe
who helped me, I think she saw me walking in circles and probably felt some
pity, and perhaps got a chuckle out of it...it took us an hour just to get
into Felwithe and to the shops and guild area! I laugh when I think about it
now, I was such a geek, I had NO clue.  It was really cool and really fun to
discover things though.  Still is actually, just went to ToFS for the first
time recently and got some Homework that gave me a nice +3 INT:) ( I realize
that is not some uber item, but to me it's great because I won it on a
roll:))
