Yep, feedback or the dev board at the EQ message board (official) In
fact the dev board is the best place to have it get read. Are they
going to answer it if they read it? It kind of depends on the subject
and if its something that will change. The more people write in about
one topic the more apt they are to address it, at least with a post.

You have zero chance of getting a reply here and not a very good
chance of even having it read by someone at verant.
