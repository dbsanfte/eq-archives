Oh, c'mon Rumble.  Read the class for his L52.  KEI has been around
for over 8 months.  All he had to do was discover KEI and he can make
52 easy with a Druid without worrying about pesky little details (and
stats are mostly pretty little in EQ).

To the OP:  For a Druid, especially once past the extreme low levels,
little matters beyond WIS which determines the size of your base mana
pool (before it is modified by +mana items and buffs).  WIS will also
affect the frequency of skill-ups for any tradeskills you might decide
to try (other stats can affect these also, but only the highest matters
and your WIS should be your highest stat).  To raise your CHA you can
get items with +CHA and/or Enchanter or Shaman buffs that temporarily
raise your CHA.  If you want it raised for dealing with NPC vendors
just buy a couple of Opal Steins (+25 CHA) at the bazaar and swap them
in when you deal with an NPC.  If you want CHA raised when fighting (I
assume in hopes of having charm animal or nature's harmony work better?)
you probably want to find other items as your PRIMARY and SECONDARY
slots are normally dedicated to +WIS and/or +mana and/or +resists.

If you take the time to review an archive of this group you can find
a lot of information, just skim (or even skip) most of the flames and
rants or it could take quite a long while tho.  Some weeks finding
good stuff here is like picking fly-shit out of pepper (/duck), other
times there're several interesting and informative threads going on at
once.  Also many useful links get posted.
