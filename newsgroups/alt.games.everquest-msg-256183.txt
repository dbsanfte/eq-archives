I agree.  I picture a bunch of 14 year old kids playing on their dads' accounts
that really don't care if they get banned or not.  So they go out there and
take out their aggression in EQ, yelling the F word, spamming crap, getting
downright nasty and being a general pain in the butt.
Trying to fight that with logic and arguing is fruitless.
Childish temper tantrums don't go far with me.  The VERY BEST thing you can do
is leave them alone in the zone.
