I was going to buy it, but they removed the download only purchase,
which means I'd have to buy it from a store at about 30% more.  And
I'm not sure I want to pay that much for a game I'm not sure I'd want
to play.

OTOH, I paid even more for FFXI and played that for all of three
days...  I suspect I'm going to end up buying it this afternoon after
all.
