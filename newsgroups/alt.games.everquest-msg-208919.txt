I've never parsed it, and it will vary from mob to mob for sure. But I
guarantee things like the zelniaks, aliens, and gorangas all the way
to the big ones in UP and elsewhere don't have the AC they should for
their level. Ones in ME and up obviously have far more hp for their
level than most mobs elsewhere. The same could be said for Grey and
the lower level Ssra mobs (about ac I mean, not necessarily hp).

However the centis do have much better AC.. could be the clerical
buffing though.

Maybe someone else will know better; I tend to stay away from Luclin
when I can due to what it does to my graphics after a few hours of
playing.
