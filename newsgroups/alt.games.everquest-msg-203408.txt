I just needed to say that your MoBo is a good one, you got all the
good advice on the video card, I believe you need to just upgrade your
memory to PC 2700 333mghz memory AND upgrade your Athlon chip to the
XP 2500 or better, that is the beginning chip that runs at the 333mghz
speed your mobo was designed to run at. Just be sure, as you know, to
read that motherboard users manual and get that baby running at the
333 it was designed to do :-)  and also feel free to get second
opinion on my advice cause it aint writ in stone Good luck friend.
