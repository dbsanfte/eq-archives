Just about sums up my actions when asked to rez.

Was in Dawnshroud camping hoppers last night to help our guild Master Smith
when I got a tell asking for a rez, sure if you drag to me, this is my loc,
by hopper caves.

The guy replies that he isn't in the zone and can't remember where he was
fighting, wasn't grouped so can't get the corpse to me, then goes on to
explain how I ought to drop my group, stop helping my guildies, wander
around a zone where every damn green wants to chew me up, drag him to a safe
spot and rez him.

My polite "Sorry I cant help you" was quickly followed by /ignore after he
got abusive.
