Just to add to this from something closer to James' level...

I am a level 65 shaman, 140ish AAs, in a guild of almost all 65s, with 
AAs ranging from none to 400ish, hitting places like Ssra, NToV, Terris 
Thule, Manaetic Behemoth, and getting lots of equipment upgrades from all 
of them yet.

Several of our monks still tank, sure, not as well as the warriors and 
knights, but, they do it in a pinch.

Same here, FD is used for pulling in many zones, and in groups, and even 
LDoNs (although rarely there, as speed is important).

Agreed.

Our pull team consists of 2 to 4 monks, a rogue or two for scouting, and 
usually one SK.

Would love to see them too.

Several SK friends of mine, some in guild, some not, regularly solo, not 
quite sure what he is talking about either.

Yep, but still great to have one around.

I love having a paladin in my group when I am the main healer, it means I 
get to nuke, dot, melee, because I don't have to do much healing.

It'd be a real bitch getting the raid out of some places without have AE

Necros rock.  80hp/tick group lifetap.  Group manatap.  Awesome DoTs, 
with FD to slough the agro.  And, in a pinch, when really needed, they 
can feed mana to seriously speed up recovery from death and to keep a 
healer or CCer going when things get rough.
