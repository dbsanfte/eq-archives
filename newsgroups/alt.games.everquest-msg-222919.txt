If you cast Pacify without having the AA abilities, its effects last
approximately 5 minutes (despite spdat parses that show 45 seconds).
Prior to the patch, if you cast Pacify with AA or duration focus it
would last 45 seconds modified by the duration enhancement.  Based
on what I've seen using Pacify to scout and to fight in the presence
of pacified mobs in LDoN dungeons, I suspect that Lull effects wear
off gradually after the spell duration is up (i.e. the mob's agro
radii gradually move back to normal).  This would explain both the
apparent ca. 5 minute duration when pulling mobs spaced almost far
enough apart to be single-pulled without Pacify and why the message
says they have fixed a "detrimental" effect rather than that they've
fixed a duration "bug" when cast without enhancements.
