Hot key and macro? or is it socials??

Simple question, and I hope a simple answer.

I wish to simply hit a hot key, cast CH and also give grp member the
message" Inc heal etc" straight after casting, then if possible, sit down in
the same hotkey.

So I assume I will need 3 lines plus some pauses to take into account of
spell cast time???

Please could someone tell me if this is possible, and how.

The reason for this is because I also use 2 accounts, and sometimes im
concentrating on the other PC, and I get the feeling that 2 boxing is as
much about hot key co-ordination as anything?

Thanks
