Bullshit. That porter will port someone in need for far less than the
going rate of 20pp. It's hard to stomach when a major twink rolls up
and only pays 2pp.

See comment above. Also, I should remind you that we are not talking
about paying 10pp for a 20pp port here. We are talking about paying
5gp or something else crazy when you are perfectly able to pay more.

There is a *big* difference. If a person offers to sell you a centi
longsword for whatever reasonable price you can afford, and you give
him 100pp after he's handed you the item when you have 5k sitting in
the bank, you have just committed a dishonest act. It does not matter
that he did not specify.  Now if you pay him 800pp because that is
what you feel it is worth even though the concensus is 1k, that's
different.

If you want free (or if 15pp or 20pp is more than you want to part
with) ports, play a porting class. People who have to pay for ports
have no room to bitch *at all*. If you don't want to pay a reasonable
amount, hoof it. You want the going rate lowered? Don't pay it as
often. It will go down then.
