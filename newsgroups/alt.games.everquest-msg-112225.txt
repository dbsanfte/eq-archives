Well I always thought this worked.  Was I just imagining it?  I started
learning to circle strafe as a means to get in more Backstabs when soloing
(not something I do often if I can help it because I suck at it).  I haven't
had much luck at getting in more backstabs, but it really seems to reduce
the amount of damage I take.  Is this real or just a strafing placebo
effect? Or maybe I'm just making the MOB dizzy with all the circling
around.......and around...... and around........
