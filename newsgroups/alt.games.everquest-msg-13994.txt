The first time I ever found an evergreen leaf it was on the ground in a bag.
Being both a ranger and a newbie at the time, I had thought I had just
stumbled on a bag that someone had dropped by accident (until no bag
appeared when I clicked on it ... only the leaf).  I began to ask any pure
caster I could find if they needed it (assuming it was a spell component).

So while you may have found the opposite to be true, I will say they will
also appear in bags, and base this statement on personal experience.

Tell you what, though. Just to see, I'll pull the three that I currently
have in the bank out and drop them on the ground one at a time to see how
they appear.  I'll be in Norrath in the morning, and will report my results
back here.
