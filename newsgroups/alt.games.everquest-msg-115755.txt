Step one press F10 to get into full screen mode, you will now have 10 hot
key slots. Put Sense Heading in slot 10 F10 2 time to get back to window
mode. Next Options then Keyboard Next 4 times, you should have user define
keys 7,8,9,0 in the top 4 slots, Click on user define 0 now select the key
you use to move forward (UP for me) Back out to save. Now every time you
move forward you will sense heading before you know it you will have
mastered the skill.
