Killfiling me is one thing, but...  Is it just me, or does
that second paragraph look like a desperate attempt to
deter me from possibly embarrassing Bizbee any further?

Especially since for all his faults, Bizbee *can't* be dense
enough to think that the only reason to post a public response
to a person is for that person's sole benefit.  So when
he says, in effect, "you're stupid if you ever respond to
any post of mine again because I won't be reading it",
it looks instead like a clumsy ploy to try to shut me up.

If so, it's not going to work.

If Bizbee can "justify" in his own mind some of his more
outrageous and offensive flames (to the point of screaming
obscenities at me for daring to question his propriety),
then I'm sure as heck going to feel free to continue
to speak *my* mind.
