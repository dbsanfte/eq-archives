Just as a side note, I don't think I'd be having much fun on Sullon Zek if I
were Evil.  The thrill of being in danger just wouldn't be there, especially
if I were in Kunark, Neriak, Grobb, or Ogguk (though I think I'd find being
an Evil Paineelian or Qeynosian to be full of thrills....hehe).

I think as a Neut, I'd be having some fun, but not as much as much as I'm
having as a member of the Good Team.  If I had chosen Neut, I'd probably be
running supplies to the Good Team up in Everfrost... roleplaying as a
blockade runner/smuggler/arms dealer.

The biggest thrill of PvP for me is not PK'ing, but escaping from dangerous
situations unharmed.
