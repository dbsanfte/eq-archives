If you have an AGP card, what you do is check in your BIOS
settings for something labeled "AGP ratio", or something
like it.  On my motherboard the setting is labeled
"AGPCLK/CPUCLK".  This means the speed of the AGP board
relative to the CPU bus speed (*not* your chip's internal
speed, which is what's printed on the front of your computer).

It's probably set to 2/3 now, crank it higher and see if
everything still works.  If not, set it back down to 2/3.
Video cards are designed to run up to 66MhZ (which is 2/3
of the fastest "normal" CPU bus setting of 100MhZ).  But
many can be pushed faster without having a stroke. (The
same goes for CPUs, I've been running rock solid pushing
a 533MhZ Celeron chip to 808MhZ).

Note that cooling becomes ever more critical as you push
chips faster.  If your video card has a fan on it already,
make sure it's free of fuzz and lint, and that some other
nearby card isn't restricting its access to plenty of air.
If it doesn't have a fan, consider adding an in-case fan
that has its airflow aimed directly at the video card.
