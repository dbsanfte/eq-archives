I just upgraded my MB and chip to an AMD Duran 1Ghz and see no problems.  I
am also running Windows XP, 640 MB ram, and Geforce 3 Ti200.

You shouldn't have a problem but I would turn off or scale down most of the
textures since it is your 2nd account computer.  Then again you may not have
to.  I use a 150Mhz, 80 MB ram, and an ATI Xpert video card as my second
account for PLing and transfers and it is actually somewhat playable with
all textures and extras off.
