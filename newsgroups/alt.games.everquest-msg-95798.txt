When I was reading the hacker stuff way back when I read that the pet took
1% period all the time every time. Even if the pet did 100% of the damage.
The guy did several tests trying to get it to do any other split.

He did prove that it was correct that the pet took 50% of the solo exp if it
out damaged the pet owner.

But that was a long time ago it could be totally different now. Does showEQ
still work anymore?
