  Eh, I don't know.  It all depends on the mobs in question.  Do the orange
con mobs give substantially less experience and loot that the blue con mobs
in EQlive?  Not trying to be a smart ass here, I didn't really play EQII
long enough to get a sense of that.  I mean, in EQLive most classes can
handle killing a light blue mob, I think, at most levels. But is having
that ability the same as saying that this makes it so that any class can
solo?  Well sure, in theory I guess. But I sure as hell wouldn't want to
spend the time to level up off of light blues.  If orange cons in EQII give
substantially the same effect as light blue mobs in EQL, but I would assume
with a bit more difficulty, than yea, I would say that the game is anti
solo.

  All of this is conjecture, of course.  I'm don't have any personal
knowledge if the two are similar or not.
