You have taken what you know based on previous experiences and applied
that to the announced changes and arrived at a conclusion.  So have I. 
The two are not the same conclusion, nor is either right or wrong. 
Ultimately both are speculative opinions, the only difference being that
I am not afraid to admit this fact.

I have come to the conclusion that there are inherent dangers in making
fundamental changes to a long standing game.  While such changes as have
been proposed will likely encourage a certain element of the potential
player base to subscribe which previously would not  have, there is also
an impact on the other end of the spectrum which may lead to another
element which previously had been subscribers to no longer continue to
do so.  To what extent this impact will reach and in fact to what extent
continued changes to the game will follow this same pattern of impact
none of us ( let me repeat, none, as in specifically NOT
YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!) knows.  Based on my knowledge of gaming environments,
gamers and folks in general my conclusion is that while the changes make
sense in a business sense, it does not bode well for serious gaming. 
That being said, I, just like you, am spouting off for the hell of it. 
That is unless someone is paying you to speak on the subject as you do.

I can assure you that there are great differences between how I think
and how you think, even without any knowledge of how you think.  If you
thought via the same processes that I do you could not post as you do. 
I do not claim to understand how you think, but I am most certain of
your thought processes not being the same as mine.
