THOSE LIL CHUBBIES!

Kind of an apples and oranges thing though. They found the Titanic and
explored it which pretty much means if some large sea serpent was in
loch ness it certainly would have been found. Its a lot like bigfoot,
man is really great at making anything that really exists or ever
existed very extinct even if its on the farthest corner of the earth
so if such a thing existed and was large we'd have certainly bumped
into it and shortly made it extinct thereafter.
