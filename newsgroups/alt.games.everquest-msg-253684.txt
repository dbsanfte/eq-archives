strange how they now say "Estimated downtime is still 9 hours." when it was
8 hours originally :P

sounds to me like they've looked at the bug reports from test at the last
minute and realised they've got some work left to do

I have noticed that the start time for these updates has been creeping
forward ... didn't they used to start them at 1am? ... maybe it's just my
imagination <shrug> ... either way they're starting an hour earlier than
originally planned to compensate for the extra patch hour.
