I'd make a vah shir. They get sneak which is great for factions and
have very good goody-race factions.

It doesn't take long at all to get vah shir to where it can join with
friends. You can run to nexus basically with sneak or one invis
potion, then take a port or get one from some passing porter.

As far as wood elf or human it doesn't really matter. Wood elf is
wimpier and human can't see as well. Half elf, which is a mix of the
two.. (go figure...), is really better than either.
