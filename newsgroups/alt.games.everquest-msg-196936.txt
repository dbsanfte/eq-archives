That's a good point.

I guess there is no official "this is too much clicking/keying" guideline
to follow, so when I asked about bard song twisting, I was kind-of sort-of
going on gut instincts in thinking it was too much.  Well, that and going
on the comments of several people who play bards and have commented on
discomfort during play and moving to alts to give their wrists a rest.

The missing part for me was not realizing bards would be, well, too uber
if songs could be auto-twisted.
