I agree.  I can understand him saying sorry, but it should be because you
already have pretty good equipment and he wants to help someone with greater
need.  No need to make it a personal thing.  Isn't everyone in the game
supposed to supervised by an adult? ;-)

Now, where are all these people giving great stuff away?  I'm still wearing
a senior apprentice robe, a little silk, mixed with cloth, and I finally
scraped together the cash for a fine steel greatstaff.  I do have a spare
set of clothes stored at the bank, but I discovered the hard way that if you
even own a set of robes, you can't get the set off your dead body to put
away for safe keeping.  Of course I hear people giving stuff away, but
usually some weapon that would burn my hands.  We wizards don't do swords.
Not sure why we can't handle a mace.  How hard can it be?  It's just a big
club, right? ;-)

Cheers,
Eladil
