CAMPS...

Okay, I understand that GM's and Guides don't get involved in camp
disputes...   they shouldn't have to.  I think there are primarily (for my
purpose) two types of camps;

(1) Rare Spawns, whether there are placers or not.  You wait until it
spawns... kill once and leave.  Dyllin Starshine is good example, 7 hour
plus spawn rate without a placer spawn.  Another may be like the Necro that
is supposed to spawn at the undead shrine in Lesser Fay.  You have to kill
dozens of skelly & mummy spacers (between 10pm & 7am) to get the Necro to
pop.

(2) Experience/Loot camping.  Here you have a common spawn that you kill
over and over again.  These are any orc camp, shadowed men, bandits,
minotaurs, etc.

The latter (#2)I believe is a disputable camp.  No one should own a camp
kill after kill after kill....

The first one (#1) however, is (in my opinion), a valid camp.  If noone is
camping a rare spawn before me, and I sit there and wait for however many
hours, no one should come along and try to take that spawn.  Period.

I was tooling around... just finished my Symbol of Tunare quest by getting
the 4 ghast hearts (tedious enough there), and I decide to work on Testament
of Vanear.  I did my homework and knew it would be a heavily camped 7 hour
plus spawn without any spacers.  I run over to check it out.  No one
"sitting there", so I give a shout (to be polite) asking if someone was
camping.  Reply came back from Asradin, "I am".  Soon after Dyllin spawned
and I waited a bit.  Decided to give Asradin a tell.  Asradin replied "where
are you?"  My reply, " with the smugglers."  "Where's that" he says back.
Now I was a bit perterbed, but I walked him through how to get there and let
him take the kill.  He was 44 level, so he had no trouble.  I tried to help
him and ended up with the 40+ level smuggler on me...  DEAD.  I came back
and waited...waited... waited for the next spawn.  Close to 6 hours later,
Thornbark popped in.  I had been shouting every 15-30 min that I was waiting
on Dyllin, so I told the little 12 level dwarf that I was camping Dyllin.
All I got from him was smart ass remarks and a few rude gestures.  His BTM
caster friend said they had been trying to camp him for weeks.  They stayed.
I did a petition out of frustration and a /report.  Basically Breanah, the
guide, said they don't get involved in camp disputes.

I thought it would have been funny though, after thinking about it, I'm 29
level druid... the two of them could have held Dyllin still while I blasted
him.  I could have easily got 51%+ of the damage.  It didn't matter, they
abandoned the camp around the 7th hour, but it still burned me up how rude
that little Thornbark was!
