The example of slipping in the puddle doesn't apply. The simple act of
walking improperly on the leg worsens the injury. Theater is not
liable. The act of allowing one's self to become overly involved in an
unmoderated social situation when they have a pre-existing social
disorder leads to problems stemming from that social disorder. The
"hosts" of the social setting aren't at fault.

The "trauma" that led to the kid's suicide isn't any worse than the
"traumas" he would have suffered interacting with, say, fellow
students in school (in fact, probably less so). Do you hold the school
responsible if a girl dumps her boyfriend and he hangs himself over
it?
