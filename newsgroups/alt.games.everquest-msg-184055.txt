The original creator of the guild CAN get control of the guild again. 
Your best bet is for the current guildleader to disband the guild and 
everyone go out to chat and start a new one with a new name NOW!  Don't 
wait till the old (non) leader takes over.  You'll have yourselves a 
nice guild without having to worry about that idiot giving your guild a 
bad name.
