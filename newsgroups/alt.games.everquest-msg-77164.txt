Creative cards and new OSes always seem to be hit or miss (which is why I
have sworn off the Soundblaster line forever).  HOWEVER, the problems
related to SB/Audigy problems and XP seems to only be related to systems
with newer (specifically VIA) chipsets.  Creative does now have drivers for
the entire line for XP, although, honestly, they did not work at all for me.
(Although note that was with an Asus A7M266- VIA Southbridge and now a Soyo
D+- VIA KT266A chipset.)  All I can tell you is try it.  If you don't have
sound now, then you're not losing anything by trying.
