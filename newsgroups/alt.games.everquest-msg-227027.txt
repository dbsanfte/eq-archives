Recently in this group, someone posted the solution to hard to loot 
mobs: using the typed in target command with a portion of the mob's name 
long enough to make it a unique target within your /target range, using 
underlines for spaces if necessary

for example, if A Named Mob is dead but not visible at all,

/tar a_na
is sufficient (probably more than sufficient) to pick it up on your 
target bar.

Then you type /loot to open the looting box.  This has a shorter range 
than /target, so you may have to move around a bit to get it to work.

This solution hasn't failed for me in the several weeks I've been using 
it, and I mostly use it when the ML complains he can't loot something, 
so only on difficult targets.

As for who should loot, ideally a pure melee, since looting eats up 
valuable "on your butt" time, which even hybrids usually benefit from. 
If available I'd pick a rogue, since this allows them to practice 
pickpocket, and because given that they have the pickpocket skill 
anyway, you are forced to trust them about the cash anyway, might as 
well put all the trust on one person.
