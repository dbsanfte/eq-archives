}For example, my next pc upgrade will consist of a new motherboard,
}proc 

How did you get a motherboard that -procs-?  What's the effect?

}Compaq was
}familiar with the law and knew that they could not reverse engineer
}the ibm directly. They found a loophole and what they did was have one
}team of engineers look at the PC and how the CPU and such worked and
}then take notes on what it did and how it worked. A second team then
}looked at that info and then designed a computer which did the same
}thing in the same way, a clone in a way. Likely due to that happening,
}the same thing can't happen with such closed platforms now ;)

I don't really have a point here, but remember the Franklin Ace?
(I think that's what it was called...)
