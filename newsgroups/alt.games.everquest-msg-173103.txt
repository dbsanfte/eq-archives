Well...to be honest, if someone joined the army and didnt expect to get
involved in fighting someone elses battle for them, I would be very worried
for them.

Wrong. The people who are going out there are facilitating these "actions",
and therefore must take responsibility for their choice. Im sick of this
"well...our boys are putting their lives on the line for us, so we all have
to get behind them" bullshit. The boys are putting their lives on the line
for political (and economic) gain....thats it. Anyone who does that is not
deserving of my consideration anyway.
