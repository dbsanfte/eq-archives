>>>>I'm loving this bazaar. ;-) <<<<

Personally, I will be even MORE happy with it after most people get a basic
understanding of economics. If you are selling something for 1k and it's
still a week later then perhaps you should lower the price.

Just before I /vendor myself, I do a quick pricecheck on what other people
are selling *my item* for and adjust my  prices up or down according.
