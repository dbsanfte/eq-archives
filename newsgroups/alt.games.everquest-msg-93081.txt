Hmmm, that's one that I haven't seen before.  I generally don't pull the 4 
gargs unless we have a feign puller, though in a guild group I will.  
(With guildies I'm not the puller and I can just work on mezzing and 
fighting.)
I know that when we were trained the 4 were up, as we were waiting on dog 
respawn and has killed the two about 4 minutes prior to that.  I've pretty 
much determined that this was an intentional training, by a whiny little 
jerk who didn't like the fact that we were camping and didn't allow him to 
join us.  His guild officers would not even respond, but everyone knows 
they're just zerkling jerks.  (As an aside one of their guildmembers 
trialed with us, was resoundingly rejected, but still talks to several of 
us in pickup groups.  He's about to get kicked out of that guild for 
'telling MoM<my guild> their<zerg_guild>  strategies.  We're having a 
ball thinking what they could have told us.  Hmmm, to kill Gorenaire, get 
20 clerics, and 20 warriors, and 20 wizards, and 10 bards, and 10 
pallys.....
