I've been attacked through walls and had fish chase me about, but at least I
can target them and attack them.  I've had mobs cast halfway across the zone
on me, but only after I've stirred them up first.  This time I had no
previous aggro (as far as I can tell), and couldn't see nor target the mob.
Usually when I get physically hit, the "target" shows up and my target
window.  Nothing did this time.
