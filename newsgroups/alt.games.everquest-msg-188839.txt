Well that's what "warez" apps or games are supposed to be..just
tryouts.
It always says on that NFO file " If you like this game (or app) buy
it, support your software companies".
Considering  that some companies don't have Demo versions of their
app or game , sometimes it is the only way to try out their product.
I've saved tons of bucks by trying out the warez version of something
I thought I wanted and then found out it was a pile of crap. I can't
even think of all the games alone that I "got" that I was planing on
buying that were in fact crap. And yes, I always buy the ones I see
that are worth my money. Hell, I've even gone as far as taking classes
in some of the 3D apps that I "warezed" first and bought later.
So as long as you "Buy" the ones you like and toss out the ones you
don't , you are in the right as far as the warez world goes, but if
you still got that copy of Half life you downloaded and played, that's
a no-no. :)
