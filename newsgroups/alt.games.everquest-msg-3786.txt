You're paying for the servers that sony keeps running over in San
Diego... probably hundreds of the things by now.  All your PC does is
load in the current level map, related models, and textures, along
with a few other non essintial things such as game music and the like.
The Sony servers provide most of the actual game information itself...
As well as your character.
