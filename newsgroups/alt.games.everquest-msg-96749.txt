Excellent.  Just one more change is needed now for translocate: the small
portal fragment component for the translocates to small spires has to go.
The problem with small portal fragments is the price...they are about the
most obnoxious price possible.  They are cheap enough that you feel silly
asking for people to pay the component cost, but expensive enough that if
you do NOT make people pay, it will add up to real plat fast.  Either the
price should go up to 10 plat or so, or they should get rid of them.
