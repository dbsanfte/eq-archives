I've been grouped with some people who make a note of all loot.. its funny
at times to see a cleric who "forgot" about various loots that need
randoming at the end.

:)

Friend (chanter, lvl 60, absolutely broke.. the one who gave me my first
haste item at 49 - he was lower level) told me about a recent story..  he
did a big AE group, he said several thousend pp gems dropped, and the cleric
who hardly cast symbol kept every single one... meanwhile he burnt 2 stacks
of dots in the group.  Im good at bitching :)

Wheras he's pretty quiet..  I asked him the cleric name, but he said "whats
the point? it happens every single day"  He has nothing at all, theres been
times he couldn't even afford food and drink, let alone dots.
