Well, it all depends what you consider a reasonable chance, but I really 
don't think it's that bad.

This matches with my common experience.  I don't think I've ever had to
try more than 3 times to succeed on a spell I needed.  And I rarely bother
with a geerlok, but thank you, whoever mentioned them here... I sold two
of them yesterday... Only 58 left in the bank.  If yer on Ayonae Ro,
please shop at Stroma's Junk Shoppe!

Success rate formula used is from http://tinyurl.com/37o4b

Skill with geerlok estimated by eyeballing it, not confirmed in game. 
Skill caps calculated as (level-15)*5 (except at 16)
