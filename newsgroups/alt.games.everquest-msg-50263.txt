I want to stay anon with regard to who i play in game.  my reasons for this
is mainly so I will be less available hacking.

If you think I don't know how to play the game / my chosen chars, your
sorely mistaken.

I'm looking to improve the game, and think this would help it.

so far we got 4 people who say they don't want it changed, and lone me who
says they want it changed.
