I'm just not excited about this based on *my particular playstyle*.  The
ability for group buffs, bard songs, and MGB to hit mage pets sounds great
on paper, but, particularly in LDoN, the buffing gets done outside of the xp
zone.  My regular groupmates include a Cleric and Shammy and I'd love for my
pet to have Virtue and Khura's, but the reality is that those are almost
never cast in the dungeon itself.  Another situation is a zone like Veksar.
We zone in, buff up, then make the run to a camp.  At various times we have
to invis, so even if the pet got in one the buffs at zone entry, *poof*.
When I find a pickup group, even if I was in a situation where I didn't have
to invis at some point to get to the camp, again, when I get to camp the
people there are already buffed up.  Everything doesn't come to a halt to
cast group buffs on my entry. Basically, I'd be paying a bunch of AA to have
my pet effected by bard songs,  but I just don't group with enough bards to
make this AA worthwhile even at 10 points (and it gets under my skin that
something that should be "built-in" is going to cost AA points).  If pets
could cross zone lines and I could keep a pet up invis, this would be
awesome.  I've never been on a raid - would Pet Affinity have great value
there?
