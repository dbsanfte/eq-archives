I am making no assumptions at all about time.  Being omniscient does not 
mean that you know everything at about one particular point in time.  
(although, arguably one could say that you can extrapolate everything 
else from that anyway).  Being omnipotent means being all powerful, it 
does not have anything to do with the act of creation in and as of 
itself.  Being omniscient means that God would know exactly, every single 
consequence of his act of creation.  If it does not mean that, then we 
disagree on the meaning of omniscience.  I don't see omniscience and 
omnipotence being two sides of the same coin.  Omniscience means have 
complete knowledge of everything.  Omnipotence means being all powerful.  
If an entity is all powerfull, and all knowing, then, by definition, said 
entity knows exactly all consequences of all actions said being takes, 
regardless of when said entity takes said actions.

Now, if you would care to offer some alternate meaning of omniscience 
that does not imply that God somehow does know everything, yet remains 
omniscient...

If we really do have free will, then, God cannot know how we will decide, 
and he is not omniscient.  If, on the other hand God is omniscient, then, 
he knows every single consequence of creation, whether said creation is 
something that happened at some point in time, or is some ongoing 
process.  Time is completely irrelevant here.  I am not saying that he 
knew just at the time of creation, if he is omniscient, then he always 
knows everything at all times.  If this is not the case, then, there are 
times at which he is not omniscient.

Perhaps at the moment of creation, he chose not to be omniscient, in 
which case, despite the fact that he now knows how we will make each and 
every decision, he did not at the moment of creation.  (assuming of 
course that creation was some event in time).
