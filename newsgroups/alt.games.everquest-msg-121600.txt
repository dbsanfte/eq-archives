Only because you have taught the dog that when you move your hand in a
throwing motion a ball usually comes flying out of it. My dog has heard our
door bell ring maybe ten times in the 8 years she's been a resident of our
household but when the doorbell on the TV rings, she'll go to the door and
bark like crazy. We have taught her that if she comes back to the door when
we let her out she'll get a biscuit (we live in the city, BTW). She does her
best to take advantage of this by trying to get me to let her out even
though my father had just let her back in 10 minutes earlier.

I'm not saying dogs are smarter than cats or cats are smarter than dogs;
most animals show a potential for learning, thus changing our understanding
of intelligence (this phrase is usually used to mean "we had to change the
deffinition because under the previous one dolphins would be considered the
most intelligent creatures in the universe"). Back when milk used to be
delivered on the doorstep on a daily basis, birds were observed open ing the
milk and drinking it from the bottle; the geographical are at that this
phenomenon covered at the amount of time it took for it to grow was to short
to be some sort of evolutionary trait, the birds learned the bahavior by
seeing another bird doing it and then doing it themselves.

There was a program on the Discovery channel several months back about a
group of scientists that were keeping track of a pack of white wolves. There
was a member of this pack that the others would beat up on all the time.
When this particular member was one day killed and eaten by a mountain lion,
the others showed mournful behavior for a while and would show interest in
the area in which the dead wolf was killed whenever they passed it in the
future, much in the way elephants show interest in the bones of their
ancestors. My grandmother's cat exhibited a mournful behavior after my
grandfather's death, as well, so animals seem to understand if not death
then the loss of someone that used to be there all the time.

Keep in mind that every test for intelligence is flawed because of bias.
This is true for tests of human intelligence as well as for animals. IQ
tests, for example, take into account cultural understanding. This means
that the most brilliant person in Japan could come up with a low IQ score if
taking the American IQ test. There was a once a linguist who wanted to prove
that language affects intelligence. He wanted to do this by showing that the
Mandarin Chinese language does not allow for very abstract thought and
therefore people who speak only Mandarin Chinese would not be able to think
anymore abstractly than the language allows. Of course, this study is
intirely irrelevant because all he proved was that he didn't have a enough
understanding of Chinese to properly translate an abstract sentence.
