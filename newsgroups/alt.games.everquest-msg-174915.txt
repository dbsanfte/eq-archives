Heh....  You ever tried to walk across a major metropolitan street, when the
drivers don't really want to give right of way?  Pedestrians get right of
way... if they're willing to argue it with two tons of death on wheels.

It's easier to get into your car, where at least you probably have airbags,
seatbelts, and are a LOT more visible.  (Not that that has helped me.  I've
had my car bashed up three times in three years.  Maybe it's because I'm
doing something unexpected: obeying the traffic laws.)
