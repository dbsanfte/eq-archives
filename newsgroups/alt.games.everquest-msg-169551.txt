Good grief.  You're comparing a "rule of thumb" for casual writers to
the idiosyncracies of a genius.  That's even more absurd than the
person who defended constant phonetic misspellings (rendering their
character's conversation effectively unintelligible in any sort of
time-pressure situation, i.e. in-game combat emergencies) because some
SF writer (Ian Banks?) did a half-decent novel with half the prose
written in that fashion as a reasonably effective gimmick.  We're not
writing novels, or newspaper/magazine humor columns, or any other sort
of leisure reading here.  EQ is a real-time interactive environment in
which we talk to one another in order to coordinate our actions.  If
you deliberately make yourself hard for your groupmates to understand
you do them a tremendous discourtesy and ought to be booted from the
group as a clear "message" in reply.  Non-group social interactions
in-game are a different matter, of course.
