A bard is a hard class to play in lower lvl because no body relly wants to
group with a bard.. they rather group with an other class.. but in higher
lvl a bard is extreamly usfule for mana song and helth song.. but even at a
higher lvl... would you like to play a char that does only that.........

bards are fun i have a lvl 17 bard ... still like my paladin better

dont forget ...  play want you find the most fun to play.. i know i would
never be a good caster... im more of a meat shield kinda guy  :) mouhahahah

Woten Thejust
Outsider domination
Seventh hammer

ps: tremere is my biznach !!!!!
