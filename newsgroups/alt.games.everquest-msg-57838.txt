I tell them to go away or will kill them. Usually they do, I only had to
actually kill one.

No duel needed, and I play on a green server, mostly. However, the druid
"rain" line of spells will hit another player, if he is near enough to
ground zero when cast, targeted on myself... He should have gone away...
