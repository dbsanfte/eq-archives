Yep well I work for a living. I have $2500 in house taxes to pay. 
Lets see, placing money into the stock market.  Placing food on the
table, oh and paying the utilities bill so that I can play EQ.  Damn
glad that the game is far easier and less "arrogant" to play and
experience.  Relaxing.  I play games to relax, NOT to pile on stress.

That is true.  But they did adjust ... the mobs at higher levels are
now worse than before! If you scale the mobs along with the
progression of gear improvments, its all the same.  I think what has
changed is the calliber of the players.  Most people who started off
with EQ,  were D&D, TSR, Eye of the Beholder, Ultima Underworld/Online
types.  We could easily understand and adapt.  Now you have the
"playstation" generation comming online, and they are not to bright in
the ways of D&D and medival lore type games.

I don't feel that way at all.  The game is just as fun since its
relese.  Just different.  EQ 2 is going to be more like LDON meets EQ
1999.  Looking forward to it!

Thank Sony for realizing a change was needed.  Spending 10 min just to
take a boat in OOT ... give me a break!

Me neither!  Thank Sony for adjusting the game so that individuals can
now play the game and not be the virtual slaves of other over bearing
people!
