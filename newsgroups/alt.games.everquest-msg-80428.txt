My son was playing his 7th level Ranger.  He had gone to Freeport and was
looking for a gate back to Kelethin.  A high level player offered to help
him, but instead of gating him to Kelethin, sent him to a remote island
somewhere where he was immediately killed by a Cyclops.

Well, I was not around to help and my son got so mad he just gave up and
deleted the character so it's too late to do anything now.  If anything like
this ever happens again what should we do?
