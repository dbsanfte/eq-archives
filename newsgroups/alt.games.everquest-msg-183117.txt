Dont get used to soloing anymore (if you can much now anyways).  After
mid-40's soloing will be mostly impossible, even the lblues will give you a
run for your money.

Needless to say, warriors are not good solo'ers for many reasons.  This will
change as you get better gear and some AA to help, but don't count on
solo-ing dblues ever again.
