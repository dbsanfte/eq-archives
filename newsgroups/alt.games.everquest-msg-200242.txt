If I were a person whose greatest ambition was to explore I'd pick a ranger. 
You get tracking at level one.  Set it to "distance".  Now when you enter a
zone hit it!  You'll immediately know if the monsters in the zone are going to
kick your butt or not.
At level nine you get a light healing spell, a couple of buffs, and a SNARE
spell to slow those monsters down.  
So what if you die alot?  You don't lose your gear anymore like you used to. 
Get yourself bound in any friendly city and set off exploring again.  

>Whats the proper way to get spells into your spellbook
>BTW to set the record straigt i play a 5th lvl Human Warrio

Warriors aren't casters and don't get spellbooks.
