Not sure what your budget is but relatively cheap and good value are Gothic
Steel armour which has poitives to stamina, strength, SvMagic and is player
made. Stone Bladed Axe (
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7251 ) is good to start
off with for 1hs as it is relatively cheap, though keep an eye out for a
Glowing Black Sword (
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3803 ) for later on when
your weapons skills start lagging - this is very cheap these days and the
+20 dex is handy and the lower damage prolongs the mellee fight.

If your finances are a bit healthier... *cough* spider silks and/or HQ cat
pelts in EK *cough* ...then I strongly recommend the following two items:

Silver Chitin Hand Wraps (
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6282 ) , great for
starting out when you are primarily mellee and for later on when you are
skilling up and a great investment as nearly any character you have will
benefit from these. Also a Sarnak Backstabber (
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=6835 ) doubles up as a
nice piercer and range item. This item seem to vary in price though - I
picked on up for 350pp on Tunare but they go for between 1-2 K on
Stormhammer.

Try to stick to flexible items that you can use on all sorts of alts, that
way once you outgrow them you can hand them down to your own alts of
different classes. This way you can afford to pay a bit extra for better
gear as they will get so much use. For example - Crystal Chitin Armour is an
example of damn fine equipment which is worth purchasing as it can be used
on so many alts from druids to warriors. Shadel Bandit Ring (
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=7176 ) is another example
of flexible value as well.
