Well, that's the definition of affirmative action, and of course I'm not 
arguing with it. Where we disagree is that you consider it unfair, and I, 
taking the historical perspective, do not.

Obviously, it doesn't matter to *you*. But would it matter to you if you 
were black?

No, not their position of poverty, but the remaining endemic racism in 
society, which is what Affirmative Action was designed to compensate for.

Well, painful as it is missing out on a job or a scholarship because of 
AA, it's certainly better than being forced to sit on the back of the 
bus, and that was happening within the lifetimes of some of the posters 
here... The laws have changed, but the attitude cannot have magically 
dissapeared in just forty years. I can relate to your frustration, but 
in this case, I do believe that two wrongs make a right, or at least 
closer to a right than it was before.
