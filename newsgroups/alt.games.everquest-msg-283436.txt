Yes all 5 missions to max out the slipgear aug. When you complete any
one of the mission and hail the Slipgear you will get a basic aug.
Each time you complete another mission and hail the npc your aug gains
power.  Max is after doing all 5 missions.

Quite easy.  Get a level 70 rogue shroud if you need to, get FoE or
SoE and you could get 3 or 4 of those done before you run into
problems.  Hive and Illisan has some see invis mobs but you may be
able to sneak around those.
