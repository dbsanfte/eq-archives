Same here, but I don't classify it is a MMORPG.  I don't believe there will 
be -any- decent persistant worlds will exist within the first year or maybe 
even 2 years.  I imagine a ton will get started, and then eventually, the 
few people who have the talent to get one going and keep it going will get 
out of the group they are in and get together and put a quality one out.  
99% of them will die for lack of creativity, hardware, throughput, and 
support.

I'm much more interested in playing the modules that will ship with it ( 
with a group of friends ) and getting into 1 online module with people I 
don't know.
