On what basis do you assert that the universe is _not_ the "perfect
tool for the job"?  For that matter, how about sharing your 'leet
beta infoz that defines just what "the job" is?  I, for one, would
really like to resolve lingering doubts as to whether our existence
is fundamental to the Creator's purpose or we're just an unavoidable
side-effect.  I mean, the universe is awfully big and our sandbox is
so incredibly tiny on that scale.
