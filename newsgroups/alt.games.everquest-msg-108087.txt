I find the same problems with my 51 enchanter. My pet can tear through blues
when its buffed and dueal wielding, but the xp is crap when im on my own.
Duoing with a 52 ranger (snare+my fear, extra melee damage, extra clarity
recipient) I can xp faster than sebilis or the hole. It is just non stop
pulling with about 100 dps on average. We killed slixen klex and dino in
oot, and both were easy. Unfortunately geetting people interested in this
type of xp'ing is just about impossible. It doesnt fit the cookie cutter
method, so they have no faith it will work. They would sooner sit in kc LFG
for an hour.
