Um.  Did you read my post?  Did I say anything that implied Bin Laden
doesn't want to win?  I know the idiot wants to win, I said that his way of
trying to win was seriously miscalculated.  And do *not* come to me spouting
bullshit about how the poor guy is so outmatched he's desperate and has to
try *somethng*.  Bin Laden does not deserve to win.  Would you really like
to see the world ruled by an extreme religious dictatorship who'll throw you
in prison if you don't pray towards Mecca five times a day and flog women
publicly for letting their veil slip or being disrespectful to a man?  Well,
if Bin Laden had his way that's how the world would be.  So, yes, he has no
fucking chance, but, also yes, that is the way it should be.  That's why we
butt into other people's business, pissing the poor guys off, so that people
like that won't be telling *your* sorry ass what to do every day of your
fucking life.
