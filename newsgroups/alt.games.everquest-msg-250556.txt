I knew your comment was coming, and I kinda hear ya.
Here was my grouping effort last night:
/t Goofie Idiots LFG interested in a LDON?  I have a cleric / chanter so far?
Is anyone under 60?  I don't want anyone under 60 exp will suxxors
Are we going to do EF?  I only want to do EF!
I can play but only for 25 minutes
I can play but I won't be ready to start for 30 minutes.
Sure! But only S RO.
{no response}
Sorry, the paladin is on my ignore list
I'll play but only if I can pull, <--(it always scares me when I hear that)

I finally joined someone elses group - the guy didn't tell us he was doing a
*AOE* group - people kept dropping when they found out - come on people SAY
what you have in mind.  I ended up with 2 blue bubbles tho and no one died so
all's well that ends well... just frustrating.
