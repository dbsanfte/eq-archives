Yes, if you are an experienced EQ player, and have a good group, then
the book is only an annoyance. Since you know how to judge situations
fast, handle them right, and trust other people to do their jobs.

This has barely anything to do with the newbie dungeon experience
where groups tend to be pickup or minimal, communication poor and
lots of people are still learning the basics of dungeon hunting.

But don't get me wrong. Removing the book was a good move on the
tedium reduction front regardless of whether or not it makes dungeons
more inviting to caster types.

I'll admit bards did not occur to me. I don't recall seeing any in a dungeon
at low levels. Nor have I, to this time, seen a bard doing CC duties in a
dungeon. In fact the last bard I saw (in SolB) was main tank....before we had
a "where's my pet" moment.

However the notes on this ability in castersrealm are rather less enthusiastic
about it. 

Keyzz says:
	If you like tons of mobs hitting you then this is the spell you've been
	waiting for. BTW I bought it in Highhold Keep. 

Gadki Sookha :
I have to agree with most people. This sing sucks now. A few months ago, I
could solo 2 or three Mobs, because it worked and kept them asleep. Since they
nerf'ed it, I might be able to interupt a caster one in three tries. I can never
taunt a mob with this song and more times than not, it help to get me killed
because it won't keep them asleep any more. I think this second resist was a
load crap. Time after time, I see it scroll across 'so-and-so nobs', yet I'm
getting pounded anyway. Thanks for a job well done Verant, you managed to
screw up something else that used to work right. If it isn't broke, don't fix it.

I don't play a bard so I can't really comment on them. And given my bad
connection, and that being a good bard requires twisting, I don't see
this changing. But I can say that even if I was a bard i'd be damn 
careful before I played an AE mez in a crowded dungeon.
