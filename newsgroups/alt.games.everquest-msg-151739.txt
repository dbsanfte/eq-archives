Welcome to Xev. Leave your wallet at the door with the nice ogre

Actually that was just scrolling back to the PLing and melee bit. That,
and a teensy bit of jealousy that I can neither camp for nor afford
those two items. (Unless I incredibly luck out and win the roll on a
white dragon hide from Gore.) But yes, those are *excellent* wizard
items.

Defense skill, believe it or not, is maxed. But then again I'm generally
the puller for Team Necro (TM), so I get beat on, albeit briefly, a lot
more than most wizards. Usually with Manaskin up, so I don't take much
in the way of damage, but the hits added up until defense was maxed.

Have to check attack, but I believe it's somewhere between "Unbelievably
Incredibly Sucky" and "Really Stinky Poo Poo". My piercing, 1HB, and
hand to hand skills are all under 20, IIRC. Has been a plan for a while
now that during the guild's next language fair (yes.... we do those and
arena rumbles from time to time) that I'm going to duel Tarre's 49 necro
pet for a few hours to try to get them up or maxed. I'd like to be able
to kill annoying greenies with my bare hands in S. Ro so I can mem my
spells undisturbed while waiting for my rez back into Hate. ;-)
