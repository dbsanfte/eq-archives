Well, I am a level 10 Barbarian Shaman new to EQ (on Fennin Ro), have
just cut off Trumpy Irontoe's head in Qeynos and need to take it to
Kaladim in Faydwer. I know I could use the Nexus in Odus to get there
( have Luclin, not PoP), but want to see the world so am going to make
the frenzied solo run across Antonica. I am scared @#$%-less because
I've only ever had to retrieve my body once (in BB) in my underwear
and hated it, but I am going to bind myself in Qeynos and head across
Karana, up through Yorbb and Rnnyeye to Rivervale, then through
Kithicor and across the Commonlands to Freeport where I can take the
boat to ButcherBlok. I fear death and highlevel monsters and having to
run from Qenos to retrieve my bloodied body in some dangerous foreign
land, but I can't wait for the adventure and would not take a magical
port if you paid me! Screw traveling first class, I want to see the
world and live!!
