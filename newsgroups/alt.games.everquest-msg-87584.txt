Agreed, doubt any GM will ban you for bitching about the product, or VI 
in general.

But in my time i can only say that around 90% of the people complaining 
about server downtime or problems related to patches (as in, VI related 
problems. As you say yourself, GMs are players, more often that not they 
cant do more about problems that we can), youll see people complaining 
and bitching about GMs, not about VI.
If you just look at the "Gms are morons, they suck" posts we see 
sometimes here, some people think that the "play nice" and "bad 
langauges" policies only last when dealing with other normal players (if 
even then), and they can disregard all respect for people and bitch all 
they want at the GMs, who are for the most parts as clueless or 
powerless as we are to fix the problems.

If someone act like a total moron and start breaking every rule about 
acceptable behaviour, and start to call the GMs names and so on, i cant 
really see why they shouldnt kick him off, just as a warning. They have 
to do it if the person act that way to other players.
