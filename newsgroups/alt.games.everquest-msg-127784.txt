Yesterday, in SolA, I went invis to one of my party members.  Just one.  I could see
myself on my husband's box.  He zoned, and I reappeared to him.  This was with my HE
cleric, btw, I have no capacity to self invis or hide, and no one had cast any buffs
on me.
   A bit latter on, Lenny when invis to another party member.  Again, I could see him
fine, as could everyone else.  The affected party member was a bit bummed, because he
was missing out on seeing the "cute little shrunked up ogre" in full crafted.  But it
didn't really affect game play.  Definitely odd, though.

Annie <--- Glad she could see Lenny.... it was nice to be taller than him for a
change!
