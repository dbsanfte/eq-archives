    That is the case - I believe if I checked only the last two updates are
on the front page. But like I said, those are big updates with lots of pics
in each.

    Your guild seems to be at about the same stage as Wraith is on ours,
more or less. Not doing the upper-end of the content scale, but highly
aggressive about getting the stuff you can do like Velious kings. 25 Dains,
huh? Wish my guild had that many seventh shawls - I'm only on sixth myself.
I'm HOPING that a lot of people in guild will get their seventh and, thus, a
lot of people will get belts. That would reduce the competition by a good
deal for the belts that I have my eye on, like the Circlet of Smoke. (I'll
never be a giant-lover. Dwarves forever!)

    Be sure to visit our forums. We may be the only EQ guild with a forum
section devoted to cats!
