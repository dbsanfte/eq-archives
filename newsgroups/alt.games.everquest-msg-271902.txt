I haven't done a lot of fighting below level 35 recently, but I do
do a lot of fighting where both the mob and I are at low health.
(As a monk, I can feign death if it gets too close.  Well, usually.
Last weekend I cut it too close and the feign took effect after I'd
been transported to my bind spot. :-)  My experience is that mobs
(a) slow down at 25% hp (maybe 24%) unless they've got a movement
buff, and (b) run at 19%, with a whole slew of exceptions:

1) some mobs never run (most skeletons and many low level insects
fall in this category)

2) if I'm also around 20% or less (not sure of the exact threshhold,
but it's probably related to the "low hits agro" threshhold), then
the mob usually won't run, though I sometimes see it give up and try
to run when it's below 5% and I'm around 10-15%

3) if they're the type that usually runs at 19%, they might run
earlier if they're very green to me

4) if there are other mobs of the same "type" (e.g., kobolds) also
fighting me, often (but not always) they won't run; if I've been
damaging them all (e.g. via dots) then as I kill the next-to-last
one I often see the last one suddenly turn to run because it was
nearly dead
