I guess I had a mean streak today.  I met a beggar that was fairly
persistant in Kelethin, and I was his target.  I put him on ignore but he
apparently took offence that I wouldn't answer and would position himself
right in my face, no matter which way I turned, for about five minutes or
so.

Finally, fed up with this pissant, I took him off of ignore and told him,
"If I give you a fine steel longsword, will you cease to bother me?".  Of
course he jumped up and down and emoted "/cheers Harken".  I told him it was
stashed at a hidden place in the city, if he could find it.  He actually
believed this crap and begged me to show him where it was hidden with a
whole lot of "PLLZZZZZ".

I could'nt resist but to see how stupid this guy could actually be. I
invited him to group, which he accepted, then told him to target me and type
/follow.  An evil grin formed on my face as I carefully led him up a ramp to
the level above the bank.  I made sure he was still on follow, and took off
running again.  Unfortunately, I, umm, "misjudged" where the ramp was and we
fell to the ground.  Don't you hate it when that happens?   I was fine, but
the poor little beggar......

Naturally, I recieved a less than pleasant tell.  I brought him back to his
corpse and buffed him up and told him, "Now go out and fight on your own and
you won't have to beg.

I know it was mean, and probably would have earned me a warning if he'd have
pushed it, but I figure the guy learned a lesson today. Folks have NO
respect for beggars and if you insist on being a jerk (like staying in
someones face), it can backfire on you.
