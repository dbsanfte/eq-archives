As pointed out, the kick has to land for the ID to work.  And it's
possible to get skill increases (at least for monks) in Kick when
attempting ID.   I find it hard to believe that something which is
obviously being checked for effectiveness doesn't have some role.

As far as "I think I would notice if I were missing kicks as if my skill
was so poor", how?  What do you have to compare it with?  (As you
point out, it's likely you'd have default kick skill level the check
would make.  There's as much reason to make that "hidden" skill
"100" as there is to make it "1," especially since you've no way to
raise it.
