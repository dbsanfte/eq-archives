Couple of weeks ago I lost a bag of spells<magician summons> to a barbarian
warrior who walked up 3 flights of stairs to a room where I was doing the
transfer just as my character loses contact.

I get back in /w to get his name and commented on his good fortune. I'm cool
with his luck, only ~33 pp worth of spells in the bag. I offer to buy the
scrolls from him at a reasonable price since I didn't want to travel back to
OOT and he says OK. I start tracking<druid> him and "You have lost your
target".

I /w all <name> and find out he has moved from EFP to WFP. I give him a WTF
tell and he says ~"I'm waiting for you at the West FP Gate", so I zone in
after him and start tracking again, "You have lost your target".

So I /w all again and he is now in NFP. I just go ahead and zone into NFP. I
give him another /t ~"If you want me to buy those spells quit zoning". He
gives me a /r "Where are you?" I /r "With you in NFP". He zones again to
WFP.

He then gives me another /r "I am at the WFP gate waiting for you" I /r
~"Going to be a long wait jerk". I get a "WTF???" back and tell him "I am
sick and tired of you playing these stupid games. Keep the damn scrolls". I
think I got about 8 more tells from him trying to convince me to go WFP and
buy the scrolls off of him.

Yeap, like I am that stupid that I want to buy an empty backpack from him
after he put the scrolls in the bank.

It took him a while before he caught on. Kept getting "Where are you now?"
/r "EFP", "Where are you now?" /r "OOT", "Where are you now?" "NKaranas".
When he finally caught on "What do you expect me to do with these spells? I
am a warrior" /r "Sell them to a vendor, you can probably get 2 pp for
them".  /r "BTW: I marked your name in my friends list as "Not <name>", I
hope you never need a SoW or a favor from me".
