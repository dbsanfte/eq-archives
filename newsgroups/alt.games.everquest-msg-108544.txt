Refuse to fight girls?Once my Bro's girlfriend stood in my mom's kitchen and
called her a bitch.I told her"say it again and I'll nail you.She did.I
did.She (barely)picked herself up and I don't even think she calls a female
dog a bitch these days.
 Shit sometimes ya gotta do what must be done,folks.
