My ranger is my first and primary and untwinked.  
Of course you plonk arrows to *pull* for groups.  I've never been in a group
where I was able to just stand back and plonk arrows, at lower level they
needed my melee skills.
Solo?  arrows are inefficient for doing *real damage*  and costly, (unless you
can afford a good bow and arrows or can make your own). I was a master at
fletching before I became a master at archery. 
Once I was able to afford a Tolan's bracer, (which produces magic arrows) I
really started working on archery.  Snare / root and plonk plonk plonk plonk. 
Very slow going, so I cast all my dots and flame lick to help compensate, then
beat on them when they are under 50 percent.  I can solo dark blues at 56 this
way.
I always have a KEI and *all* of my buff spells on.  
And I have an earring with Improved Healing II, a ring with Mana Preservation
and a necklace with Extended Range IV.  I wear them when applicable, then put
them back in my bag.
