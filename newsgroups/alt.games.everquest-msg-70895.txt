I've done it, as a conservative estimate, at least 100 times over the past 3
years.  I've done it twice this week.

I think we're talking about different things.  I'm talking about OEM
versions of Windows from Microsoft, that say "For distribution with a new
PC".  You can install this version after deleting the files I mentioned.
You're talking about personalized copies of Windows from PC manufacturers,
sometimes known as system restore disks.  These have BIOS checks and other
tricks to make sure they can only be installed on the PC it was meant for.
I wouldn't call these "true" OEM copies, since OEM means "original equipment
manufacturer" which refers to Microsoft. Your original warning about making
sure someone doesn't purchase one is good advice though, even though it's
illegal to sell them.
