Tier two isn't important till 63, exp in tier one zones is phenomenal up to that
point.

I can't think what would make you grind exp in the grey when POD, POI, POJ, PON are
available.  For the same effort in those zones you'll be getting twice the
experience, and you'll be located much closer to the transportation system if a good
group or raid comes up.

Now if you are hunting in the grey for the sport of it, more power to you, there are
loads of fun places in the game in other zones, and its good to get to them while
they are a bit of a challenge, and while the exp rewards aren't nonexistant.

Its just your characterizing what you are doing as a "grind" that make me wonder why
there... it makes no sense to me to push exp in a tedious manner anywhere but those
zones where you can do so the fastest.
