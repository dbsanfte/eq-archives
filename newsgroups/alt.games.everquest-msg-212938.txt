Please excuse the spelling mistakes (of the previous post), it should
have looked like this:
After reading the newsgroups for the past few days it seems there are
two problems keeping people from logging in correctly.
1) Custom UI files.  Set your UI to default and it should work
2) Your server is using a 'blocked' port.  -> This one seems to affect a
relatively small portion of the public, but is by far the most annoying.
The only way so far to get it fixed seems to be either have a friend or
guide move your character out of the zone they are currently stuck in.
If you want to read more on it look back on the post:
"Shared Plat Slot Bugged?" - That's where I got the information.
