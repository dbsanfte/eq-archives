I'd like that too, but its pretty rare, because I've looted stuff, sold 
it, and bought items from the bazaar that are much better than anything 
I'll loot in the next ten levels.  Unless I purposefully pick a target 
that drops an upgrade item I don't see in the bazaar, that is, then it 
might be possible.

I'm also delighted to see someone loot something thats an upgrade for 
them, although thats just as rare, for the same reasons.  But what isn't 
so rare is to see the item some stranger I was grouped with claimed on a 
NBG basis for sale in the bazaar later that same evening.  Rarely on 
them, mind you, but relatively rare stuff that hasn't been in the bazaar 
recently, on a low level character that couldn't possibly have looted it 
himself; a mule in other words.  Since the advent of the shared bank 
space, its very very easy to mule out your loot to avoid the appearance 
of "greed" selling.

I put up with NBG because I'm not all that hung up about loot, and would 
rather be ripped off than argue the point in group.  But that isn't to 
say I prefer it, its just not worth arguing.

People who actively prefer NBG, though, are either a) really completely 
selfless and happy to be ripped off if thats what makes the other people 
happy, b) ignorant of the details and think its really a fair to all 
system, or c) benefit from NBG.

Groups made entirely of the first two are fine, even though in theory 
the system has holes in it, nobody -has- to drive the mac truck thru 
them.  But the C types, I don't much care for them, and I'd rather see 
NBG abolished so as to cut them off from their source of ill gotten gain.

Does it?  I suppose it would, if I let someone take something that I 
could sell without arguement, then they'd know I was generous, and if 
they do the same for me then I'll know the same about them.  If we 
aren't busy thinking the other guy is ripping us off, that is.

I find friendships where I find them, though, loot method doesn't seem 
to affect them much one way or the other, except for that "ripping us 
off" part; thats not a suspicion well suited to friendship formation.

Funniest thing is when there's a greed roll, and I know full well that 
2/3rds the people in the group are rolling and all intending to give the 
item to one person if they win it... 4 friends playing NBG in a "Greed" 
random group.

Thats bonding for you.

Splendid
