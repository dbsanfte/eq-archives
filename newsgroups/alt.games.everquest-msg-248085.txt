Ugh.. pls no. I've run into enough variants of Leggolaaass to last a 
lifetime already. And even so... isn't their a LotR mmrpg in 
development? I doubt whoever holds LotR licensing right now would let 
them advertise EQ2 willingly.

Maybe. I still think the its too niche... particularly against a staple 
like spiderman/superman/batman.  Maybe stuff like 
punisher/spawn/underworld/van helsing etc...

Even movies based on video-games I don't know...would a trailer for EQ2 
really fit in with the Resident Evil II crowd?

> with something like Mel Gibson's the Passion I would say prob. not.
