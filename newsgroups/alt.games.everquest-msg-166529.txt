That is exactly the point, to enjoy yourself.  So if someone purchases
nominal items because it will make it more enjoyable then what is the
problem?

Now, before everyone jumps down my throat, by nominal I mean something
like a one time purchase of 1k pp to jumpstart things.  1k pp used to
be an incredible amount of cache but it has become pocket change to
many.

And take into account the players that bring to bear their RL
finances.  Let me put forth a possibility:

A player who loves the game and has played for 2 years has a 31
shaman.  He's got alot of play time and knows how to use the shaman
and what his role is in a group.  But because of RL (and making that
financial situation everyone mentions) he just can't get enough time
to grind through the next 29 levels, but would like to experience some
of the upper end riads.  What is his lot in life then?  Where is the
enjoyment knowing that he has the ability and the strategem to handle
even the highest levels of the game but will never get to because he's
busy making real money?  Or busy playing with his kids, or spending
time with his wife, etc.?

I know that people abuse this and don't have the skill required for
these upper level characters and situations, but not everyone can be
classified in this way.  And the ones that don't have the skill are
easy to spot, and those people just won't get groups.

Of course, I could be totally wrong about all of it... ;-}
