Crying like a baby.. get a life... If the game increased by that much , how
much server down time have you lost to it? How many hours were you out and
reimbursed for during bad patches.. how much hardware upgrade costs did you
invest in.. how much were your expansion packs.. well then.. shut up! It has
cost players more money to play each and every upgrade... not just the $3 a
month.. but as usual most here only think its about $3 a month.. so tell you
what everyone who thinks $3 isn't anything, send it all to me every month
and I will give you what sony has in return for the additional money..
NOTHING.. hmm sounds fair to me.. Please just kidding don't send me money..
I don't know what I would do with it all.. well other then spend it on
worthy items .. So for those of you whom think $3 per month isn't crap..
figure what a little over 12 million a year is going to get us from sony??
NOTHING!!!!!! So as we ponder the petty amount of $3 per month per player..
why not think of it as $12 million plus pulled from the players pockets to
line Sony's cash accounts... but guess that's just my way of thinking....
