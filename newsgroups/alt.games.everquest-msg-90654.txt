  Of course people are going to flame you... you are trolling.

  I have no great love for Verant, especially where their customer service is
concerned, but I think you're overreacting.

  Your "facts" aren't wrong, but, first, you should realize that you really
aren't missing out on much by not having a Tech Support phone line.  Tech
Support is useless if your technical issue is not a known issue.  Tech Support
guys aren't computer geniuses who have awesome all-encompassing knowledge of the
inner workings of EQ and your system hardware.  Generally speaking they can only
help with known problems with known fixes.  If there's a known problem with a
known fix, you can probably find it on the Tech Support board using the Search
function.  If it's not there, your call to tech support is probably a waste of
time and money no matter what continent you live on.

  As for there only being one European server... well, to me it seems really
nice that Verant has even gone through the effort and expense in creating that
one, since non-US users can and have managed to play on the servers in the US
for 3 years now.  Obviously there are difficulties involved in running a server
away from their headquarters, as the downtime you complain of indicates.  The
fact that there is only one server probably just reflects the math of the
subscriber base.

  Largely out of respect for non-American customers (and a desire for their
dollars), they have been implementing new language features in to the client and
the game.  I also wouldn't be too surprised to see another new non-American
server (maybe in Asia or Australia) brought up eventually... but they shouldn't
bite off more than they can chew... Antonius Bayle has caused them some problems
and I think they have some lessons to learn there.

  Anyway, have fun with the flames and all.
