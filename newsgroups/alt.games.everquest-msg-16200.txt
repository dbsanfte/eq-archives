I agree with this one - I've been partnered with an SK from 25-29, and we
have a simple and effective method - I pull with a dot, he hits with a
lifedrain, I hit with snare, he hits with fear, and then me, the SK and his
pet beat the crap out of the mob :-) Very efficient, and usually neither of
us gets hit once :-) If things turn nasty he can harmtouch and play dead,
and I can SoW and port.

As for the wizard, our DD's are nowhere near as good as theirs so it's dot,
root and nuke. Once you both hit 29, you'll be able to port all over the
place between the pair of you, too.
