In the months that I've been playing I've met two enchanters. Never met a 
Coercer. For some reason this is one of the least played classes, so there 
isn't much information on how they play out. That's not a good thing, 
because those classes will probably need more balancing tweaking as a result 
of fewer testers. But, there it is.
