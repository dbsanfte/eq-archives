Pre-PoP, I'd agree. I never really got a chance to test it since I was
barely 60, without Torpor or Cann5, when PoP came out but even so I
could see the writing on the wall. And yes, even now a shaman/druid
combo can handle heals almost anywhere in PoP. Which is as it should
be, otherwise clerics really would have a lock on exp groups. As it
is, they're first choice but you make do with another 2 healer if
there's no cleric around. The 3 healers are finally pretty well
balanced imo.

I never did buy that arguement, even pre-PoP. I just don't think a
pickup group would ever pick a druid over a cleric (unless someone has
a rez-bot). Pickup groups are just too iffy, you don't know the other
players, it takes a while to get used to the playstyles of the other
players (and by the time you do someone probably needs to leave), and
there's the general crap-shoot when it comes to high lvl druids that
you don't know. Is random_druid_145 someone who's quadded to 60 and
has no clue about his class or someone who knows how to group, do CC,
pull, etc. I'd never consider a druid over a cleric in a pickup group
unless a rez was available or I knew the druid.

I can't speak for the min-maxers, my favorite group is still built
around a cleric, enchanter and shaman (me); hardly a min-max kinda
group. Since I don't do many pickup groups these days, it's more a
matter of seeing what friends are online and then picking a spot that
matches the group you get. I'll always prefer to have a cleric just so
we can push the envelope, even pre-pop. It's just a lot more fun. Why
pull singles in Velks or ME when you can crawl through DN or CT with a
good group. Even if the exp isn't nearly as good, it's a helluva lot
more fun!
