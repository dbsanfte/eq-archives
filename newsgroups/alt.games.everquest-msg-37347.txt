[SNIP]

Little note here: SOW can often save someone from the NEED for a rez.
Ports do the same occasionally. Also note, how long does it take you
to RUN/BOAT without SOW or ports from, say, Odus to the deepest part
of Velious?

Back to SOW saving the need for a rez, this being said, how is
preventing the need for a 90% restoration of lost xp less valuable
than getting back that 90% of the xp you wouldn't have lost if you
just could have outrun that mob...?
