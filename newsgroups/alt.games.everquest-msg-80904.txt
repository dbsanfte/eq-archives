    Yeah, Minor Illusion is loads of fun. Think of it as a Sneak spell that
roots you. And you start to feel like an enchanter once you pull off your
first great Minor Illusion. I still remember managing to become a bunk bed
in the middle of the Kelethin-Felwithe path. :-)

    ENCH spells have horrible resists, especially the offensive ones.
Sometimes Tash (which is unresistable for your purposes) is the only way to
land your other spells. You don't get an upgrade until level 20, so it's
worth getting. Looking at
http://eq.castersrealm.com/spells/spells.asp?Class=Enchanter I'd say you
should also get the pet, Invis, the AoE Stun (which I'm still using at 35),
Suffocating Sphere.
