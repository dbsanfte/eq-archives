I had some cheap bastard ask me for a port out of cobalt scar.  I was in a
good mood and told him 20p for TL, 40 for port.  He told me he was broke.
He's hunting in cobalt scar (L53) and he's broke?  I told him to kill a
couple wyverns and he could pay me a gem instead.  But it seemed like all he
wanted was a freebie.
