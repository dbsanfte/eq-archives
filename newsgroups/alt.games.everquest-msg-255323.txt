When he says it doesn't work for bags, he means that you cant make a
slot inside the back in to a hotkey.  (I assume).  However you can
make the bag itself a hotkey.  Once it is on the hotkey bank, you can
right-click to open the bag and work with it just as if you opened the
bag from your inventory window.  I use this for my melee characters to
swap out weapons.  This is especially useful if you end up using
special bags for weapons.  (Some weapons require giant sized slots,
some want their heavy weapons in weight-reduction bags, etc...)

You can also use these techniques to swap out other equipment.  For my
Ranger, for example, I used to keep a set of dexterity gear for when I
wanted to max out dex, along with my best hitpoint gear if I had to
tank.  You can put items with clicky effects in there.  Swap them on,
right click, and swap them back off.  Things like that...
