I can't sell mine either... just soooo handy for green mobs.  I do
click mine still quite a bit tho while in BoT, PoV, etc... Maybe I
need to cut the cord and get away from it, but I can usually
contribute 1500+ DD mana free during a fight while my DoT is working. 
Do I look silly to others?  I've often wondered.. Hmm...
