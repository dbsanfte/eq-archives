You need someone who can harmony or lull pull to get singles.  
Alternatively, you need someone who can mezz the adds while you kill the 
mobs one at a time.  I don't know the level of the yard trash in PoI, so 
I am not sure what level of what class would be required for lull 
pulling.  A ranger or druid should be able to harmony, unless that is 
nerfed in PoI.  The 60 bard might be able to lull and mez there, except 
for the archaic models which are unmezzable and unslowable.  51 shaman 
will have a rough time with slowing as I recall, he will have to land a 
malosxxx line spell first I believe, and even then, expect resists, agro 
and death for him on a relatively frequent basis.
