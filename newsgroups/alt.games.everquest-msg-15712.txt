OK.  Like I said, its a small peeve for me, not something I'd get riled up
about.  I do get a bit mad when someone on usenet makes a reply then says,
"I'm dropping this thread."  Why bother posting to a newsgroup, a forum for
discussion and argument (might as well say it, that's where most people get
their entertainment value), if that's your attitude?

>Consider it to be both.

I don't.  To me, neither version of the acronym makes sense.

Yup, which is why, I let Crash have the last word, it matters very little to
me.
