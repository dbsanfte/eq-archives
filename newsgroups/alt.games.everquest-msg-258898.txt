Yes but what I mean is that this way you dont have to worry about
switching pages and there will never be a time when you have to wait
on track to refresh.  Even if you switch pages, you will have to
(annoyingly) wait on track to refresh since you almost certainly just
hit it 0.2 seconds ago.

It's like mashing taunt.  Imagine if you could mash taunt over and
over (to skill up) but not ever have to wait for it when you did need
it.

No that was my point earlier.  Tracking will update the data in the
window but the window stays minimized.
