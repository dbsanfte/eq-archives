I have mostly had my Druid hunting in the "traditional" Karanas, where
I rarely hunted with other chars due to crowding (not an issue on FV).
Every time I start to consider replacing him (one char per account on
FV) I remind myself that it's only X more levels to group port, which
I've never had a character able to do (4 levels to go now).  But I am
pretty bored with soloing him, and I've on occasion in the past been
impressed when I had the good fortune to group with a group-skillful
Druid, so I'm gonna bite the bullet and start actively seeking groups
when I play him, even tho it means giving up my current freedom to
play as long or as short as I feel like without restriction on AFK
(which has definitely been the best part of soloing him, at his
level there are lots of hunting grounds where I can AFK with little
or no risk).
