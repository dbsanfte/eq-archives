You sound fairly sincere about this, and not like some type of scammer.
(I'm guessing this because you mention 25$ as a price for the game.) So
in the same, non-hostile, sincere fashion I will politely ask you the
following:

Please don't do this. If you find a store that will take it back, they
are either incompetent or corrupt. They are NOT supposed to accept that
software back.  If they *do*, and somebody else buys it, you have just
effectively fucked over the new purchaser. They are going to take their
game home, go through the whole freaking installation, and then when
they try to finish the registration process, they will get an error
message saying "Key already in use" and be unable to play.

I know, because I got screwed over on our second account in exactly the
same way. It's fixable, but it took several days and I had to e-mail a
.jpg of the CD case to Sony customer support and wait again before they
would issue me a new key number to activate the account.

If you really must sell it, then I guess e-bay is the way to go, but you
will always leave the buyer wondering if you aren't going to change your
mind some day, call up Sony, and ask them to reset your username and
password because "you forgot it". (Which you can do at any time in the
future.)

Alternatively, if you know somebody in your family, or a close friend
who would like the game and knows they can trust you, perhaps that would
be a better transaction to try. At the end of the day, you're really
only talking about recouping 25 bucks, so is it really worth it? (Not
that 25 bucks isn't good money to most anyone, including me, but it's
not the end of the world and equate to missing your mortgage payment
either for most folks.)
