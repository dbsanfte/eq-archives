It wasn't surmising.   There's a difference between a retun policy and
taking a test drive -- so your arguement is bogus, not the
information.  You talked about usiong a weapon without having to buy
it.  

Did the dealers say you could borrow the gun for 30 days  or just that
they would return your money?  A car dealership doesn't let you test
drive for 30 days before you put up cash but maybe you can find one
that will return all the money you paid for the car.  EQ items, unlike
RL items, don't wear out and you don't have to pay taxes or
resigistration fees for EQ items.  Generally speaking, you are more
likely to find a buyer who will pay exactly what you paid 30 days
later in EQ than you would in real life.  Some will pay even more for
your "used for 30 days" weapon than you paid for it "just looted."
