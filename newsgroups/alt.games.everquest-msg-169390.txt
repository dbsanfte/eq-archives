Dang you've never been to GD during Ringwar?  One of the later rings, 
you have a war between the giants and the Coldain.  GD during ringwar is 
depopulated, no Nexus Scion and the PoK book won't work.  Lowbies who 
come to GD to xp are in big trouble.  One time I was there with my 40 
druid, I bound myself at the book, conned people as they arrived from 
PoK and told them they were stuck.  I made 300pp that night on ports 
just from that one zone.  And most of the time I was willing to port 
them out just to keep them safe.
A failed ringwar depopulates Thurg.  The giants go in and lay waste to 
the poor merchants in town.  It'll repop eventually but I'm not sure how 
long it stays that way.
