He is sorta kind of right, if you take each part of his statement 
seperately.

Wizard snare lasts longer than the druid AoE snare, Bonds of Tunare.

Wizard snare can do 4 mobs at once, as opposed to the snares that druids 
actually use that only do one target.  Of course, those single target 
snares last longer than Atol's of of Bonds by a huge margin.
