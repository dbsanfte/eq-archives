Hey folks!

Just thought some of you guilds out there could benefit from this.

http://www.WebGuilder.com

WebGuilder takes out all the time from managing a guild, and lets you spend
more time PLAYING!  This is beneficial to the entire GUILD, not only the
Guild Leader.  My guild has saved so many hours in game, using this web
application.

There's a functional Demo.  There's also a PAINLESS registration.  You
simply type in what login ID you want, select the server your guild is on,
etc, and your Guild Leader account is created INSTANTLY.  You may begin
adding your users at once!  Then your users can begin adding their character
data.

This site is a "guild hosting" web application.  It allows you to have your
own dynamic database-driven web system for your EQ guild.

Features include:

*    Manageable login accounts with Guest/Member/Officer/Guild Leader
security.  YOU can create whatever logins you want for your guild, WHENEVER
you want.

*    News posting/edit features (you can even specify any of your members
who can be "reporters"), and you can classify the security level of articles
(i.e. you may post a Member level news article.  Only those with member
access will see the articles, no guests will see it).

*    Innovative Events system lets you create and classify events.  Events
are automatically displayed on the news page too, depending on your login
access level vs. the classification of the event.  This has got to be one of
the most biggest timesavers of the whole system.

*    Characters!  Enter your character(s) data, and set one as your primary
too!  Handy "level finder" color-coding to easily identify groupmates from
the character listing.

*    Charts to show you the breakdown of your guild.  See what your guild's
levels, races, and classes are, at a glance!  And there's even a nifty chart
which shows your planes-ready and non-planes-ready members, which helps your
members organize raids/events.

*    And more!!!

Give it a spin, folks.  I'm certain you'll benefit from it.

Jason
