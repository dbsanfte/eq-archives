    You have to average 70 MANA across all your items. Because there's a few
traditionally weak slots for +MANA, like shoulders and wrists, you'd have to
be able to get a few 100 MANA items. For some of the "pure caster" classes,
this is possible at a lower level than you'd imagine because they get
spotted a +100 MANA item (their epic) and a lot of their desired gear is
slanted towards +MANA.

    With Velious alone, and not even with drops from the top zone in
Velious, ToV. Historically Verant hasn't really placed caster gear in
level-appropriate places because they didn't really understand what casters
wanted. That's why a trip to Plane of Fear could net a caster four items
with +100 MANA in different slots (Eye of CT, Robe off CT, Brain of CT, belt
off Draco) and a bracer with 65 MANA, more than most others (Zombie Flesh
from Draco). Those are some of the most desirable drops in the game for
casters at most levels (you have to get to Ssra in Luclin for better).

    It was originally put in as an anti-twinking measure, to prevent someone
from dumping 300-400 MANA worth of items on a caster twink and increasing
their mana pools several times over. The testing of what the mana cap was
did show that it scaled with level.
