Have you spent time there? Because if so, I have some questions. Kurns
tower is one of the many reasons I was hankering to start a leezard. But
I've never even stepped foot in the place. Fact is, up until now, I've
never even gone into Field of Bone except for "passing through" to
another higher level zone, or hitting a couple epic mobs for guildies
there.

It's not always possible at the hours that I play to get a shaman or
other healer to partner up with. I was thinking of hitting Kurns when I
make lvl 12. Is that doable for a while as a solo warrior? (Yes, I know,
there's down time even with bandaging. But Iksar regen makes it
tolerable.) Point is, I can solo the outdoor skellies of the lower
varieties (scalebones, etc.) out in FoB with no trouble. But will I be
able to get a decent chance at single pulls in Kurns or will I just be
running to the zone screaming like a ranger/bard most of the time?
(*grins*)

I've looked at the maps of the zone on eqatlas. Any particularly good
spots to stake out when starting out there around level 12?  Common lore
has it that I could go from 12 to 20 there without much trouble, but
"common lore" is often missing some key elements. Heh.
