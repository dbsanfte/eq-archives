As to not playing manasong I agree he was an idiot.  At the same time, you
should ask when you want something.  I am not saying you should tell the
bard how to play, but it would help if you could give him pointers as to
what the group needs.  I often ask what the group needs and don't get
answered.  It's a little frustrating.  "Do you already have chanter haste
on?" "".

Most common setup at 53:
vah shir lute in main
wristsnapper in second
vov
battlecry
cantata
(amp)

Then between
cantata
clarity
