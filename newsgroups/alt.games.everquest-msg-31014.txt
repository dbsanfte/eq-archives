Rune is a special-purpose spell.  If you're in normal situations (many
small or medium fights, taking a few hits each time), it's impossibly
expensive to keep it up and it doesn't help all that much.

In the case where you're fighting truly mean things and aren't getting
aggro except occasionally, Rune can be a very good thing.  Still, it's
only a few hits, and rarely the difference between life and death.

It's best use seems to be last-chance "healing" on a tank or over-aggroed
caster when the cleric is distracted or CH is going a tad too slowly.

And the no-damage ones are safe to use on critters that are being mezzed
as you cast.

Huh?  In single-group fighting, use F2-F6 to target party members.  If
you're looking after people outside your group, setup a hotkey for
/target Whoever.  

In addition, you should have an /assist mainTank key in addition to a plain
old /assist key.  /assist mainTank followed by /assist will get you the
mob's current target, who likely needs healing.

Always appreciated, but it's sometimes a tough choice whether to stun
the mob or heal the enchanter.  Generally, a heal is better in an area
where the enchanter is able to use AE stun.  Heals are unresistable.
