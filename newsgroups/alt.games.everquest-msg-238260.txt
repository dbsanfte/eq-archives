Naw.  Meaningful: 23%, Meaningless: 77%, meaningful-to-meaningless ratio:
23/77=0.2987.

My post was an attempt to suggest that semantics of degree might be 
relevant.

Clearly, you're using "meaning" in 2 different ways in that sentence.  I'm 
saying, well, what if we play around with the idea that the first version 
might be more meaningful than the second?

Fuzzy logic won't add or detract from the debate if you refuse to let it 
in the door.  This is true.

It might be more applicable to consider grey shades of free-willedness, 
rather than meaningfulness, although one would perhaps imply the other.  
We already have the 'free will, but it's an illusion we can't detect' grey 
shade floating around.
