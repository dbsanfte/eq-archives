First you must know how to role-play. If you would check out Harpy's Head
Tavern message boards, some of the older posts (and newer) called The
Traveller are EXCELLENT role-plays.

Second, Racist Play is only done by people not knowing exactly how to
role-play...you need to find someone that is willing and able to role-play.

Most people that I have encountered don't like to role-play, they get quite
offended sometimes, they cant deal with the racial issues that arise for
RPing. I guess I cant really blame them.
