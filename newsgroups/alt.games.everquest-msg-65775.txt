Well I do have to say, Im glad I had patience with them.  They now have me
up and playing.  I have crashed once while I was zoning and have long zone
times, <it is sparatic lengths of time though, which can be nice> but when
they can get my p233 mmx and voodoo banshee running computer up and playing,
Im very happy with them.  Im glad I did not say anything bad about them or
Im sure Kharma would have gotten me.  I hope everyone else has/had the same
luck as me.  Patience does pay off sometimes, but only sometimes  :)
