Hm,sure its a taste of matter,if one likes the  zone,I think its 
not worse than other zones,and has the big advantage,that
it never rains there.Visibility is great,my impression is you can 
see mobs farther away than in other zones.

Did you notice all the Recuso camps,they are glad to help
you out with those annoying lightcrawlers and Zelniaks.

People will train you where ? - not at entrance to Seru.

The thread started with Loio,which I like too,if only for memories :)
Problem i have now with Loio is ,that is pretty difficult to reach
compared to Maru Seru,and its total void of players.

All and all Mseru a great zone for the appropriate level,took my last
4 chars there to 34.
