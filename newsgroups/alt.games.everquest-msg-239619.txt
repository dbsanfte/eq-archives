    I love having bards along.  I agree, they are often the very best of
pullers.  However much I like grouping with them, however, I don't think it's
very practical to join a PU LDoN and say "Ok, dump someone and get a bard so we
have someone who might, with luck, be good at their class and be an excellent
puller."

There are a few very good bards in their 50's on FV, but not enough to satisfy
the LDoN demand for group members.
