 OH MAN!!!!!!  When I first seen the new models I couldn't believe it. What
happend to the cute woodelfs and the pretty high elfs. They men look gay how
they neal down and not sit cross legged. Me as do most people I know just
cut the new models off. It's sad whoever the brains was that made these
things couldn't make anything that looks any better. I do admit the graphics
are nicer, just the women look scary and the guys.....well um not sure about
them. haha
