Yeah and this comes up again when you choose your class at 10 and your 
subclass at 20, as well as your artisan class at 10. You will not be allowed 
to hit any of those levels until you complete the associated quest (or in 
the case of the artisan class, choose the appropriate class from Alfred 
Ironforge's dialog). If you keep gaining experience you can generally go to 
220%, and double-ding after the fact. This is probably an exploit that will 
be adjusted for release (I /bugged it as such) since a mob that conned even 
or blue at 9 would still con even or blue to you at 9 with 220%, thus 
gaining level 10 and 11 with level 9 experience.
