    I follow the wall when going from DSP zone to UP zone. There's enough
mobs with Darkness and HT out there that being unlucky would mean death, and
I really don't want to train more junk to UP than absolutely necessary (if
I'm going there, so are my less-robust guildmates). If I'm going from UP to
DSP, I Divine Aura through the crap right near the zone to avoid initial
harm touches and plow through the middle of the zone. I'll be training the
moment I leave UP zone anyways, so does it matter how many I bring with me?
I also won't wipe some poor Akheva shard group this way (and again, 9 times
out of 10 that group would be my guildmates).

    James
