I received another lesson in this over the weekend. My guild was
raiding Kedge, and in preparation, we were all asked to remove
/roleplay and /anon, and turn on LFG instead so the organizers could
easily identify everyone.

While I sat in Dagnor's waiting for the word to go (30 minutes?), I
got no less than four requests for sow or port, all from people who
were *not* going on the Kedge raid. Dagnor's is traditionally not a
very crowded zone - even I, the natural cynic, was surprised at the
begging I got.

And, of course, after the raid I ported to Misty. Within five minutes
of stepping into Rivervale, I received a couple more requests for
buffs from newbies.

I put the /anon flag back on. One punk actually had the nerve to
/shout about it to the zone when I went /anon instead of answering his
request.

The truly sad thing is that in all of the requests, only *one* person
actually used the word "please". Coincidentally, he was the only one
that got a buff.
