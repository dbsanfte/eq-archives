What I often do with lower level char's in that case, is switch to my next
highest skilled weapon and work on that.  Watch it carefully, and when you
see that get to skill (34), then I'd check what my atk rating is, and switch
back to my primary prefered weapon.  If the atk number's the same, you have
one more point to go :-)
