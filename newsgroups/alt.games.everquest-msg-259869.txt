Buy a fletching kit, then buy arrow parts.  Attempt to combine arrow 
parts, if successful you get several arrows.  Successful or not, the 
parts are used up.

Arrows, however, are NOT expensive, you can buy them very cheaply from 
the few vendors who actually sell them, the one in West Commonlands 
comes to mind.

More detail on fletching:  arrows require 4 parts (or more):
point
shaft
vanes
notch

If you buy the cheapest of each of these, you'll be making the easiest 
simplest arrows that can be had.  If you have no skill, this will still 
end up failing fairly often, but you'll gradually gain skill until you 
get to fletching 15, when you'll need to start doing harder recipees.

There are two ways to use a fletching kit; the normal method (new method 
to us old players) is to just click on recipies, find the one you want, 
click on that, and you'll see the ingrediants (assuming you have them on 
you) to make one attempt.  Hit combine, and you use those up and maybe 
get arrows on your cursor; you can either put them where you want them, 
or drop them on the auto inventory button.  Repeat till out of 
components or room to put arrows or just don't feel like it any more at 
this time.

Old way you click on experiment, put the items you want to try combining 
into slots in your kit, and combine; you'll get a "these items cannot be 
combined" message if you don't have the right parts, otherwise it will 
give it a try for you.  On success, if you didn't already have the 
recipee, it will be added to your normal recipee menu.

You can also make bows using fletching skill, pretty much the same 
process, but different items to combine of course.  Generally, getting 
skill ups making arrows is cheaper.
