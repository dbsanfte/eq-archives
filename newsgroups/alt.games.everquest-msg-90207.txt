Mine is a Troll, and they rock. Particularly at the low levels.. the
regen is great. But the fact is, they all work. I know Warlords of
*every* race except wood elf.  By the time you grow into your gear
you'll be able to make up for any perceived shortcomings in stats. It's
all good. If you like being different, I'd shock everyone and go for a
gnome or a wood elf. It's always a scream on raids when you see some
enraged gnone smashing into the storm giants in Kael. he he.
