I can't be bothered to answer this in details but I have a hard time 
believing this because it's simply NOT TRUE.

There are a number of vocal morons on there complaining that something 
doesn't work in exactly the way they think it should. Picking on some 
small point that doesn't work like it does in their favourite game and 
claiming that the game sucks because of it. There are a number of morons 
who don't understand that this is a beta and things need tuning.

On my medium spec but modern machine it plays great. Yes, only on medium 
levels of quality but that's as expected, the high levels are for 
machine that don't exist yet but will do in the next year or two.

And as for going back to EQ1 I know hardly anyone who is considering 
this. I've gone back to playing EQ1 partly because there is going to be 
a character wipe at live launch and so there is little point using up 
content now and having to do it all over again. But I'm still trying new 
things in EQ2.

There are few things like lag making it somewhat unplayable in one or 
two zones, but it's better than it was even a week ago and there are 
several more weeks left before launch for this to be worked on. To be 
clear, most of the games doesn't suffer from this problem one bit.

EQ2 looks fantastic and plays very well indeed even in beta and I can't 
wait for it to be launched. Almost everyone in my guild who had a beta 
invite seems to think the same.
