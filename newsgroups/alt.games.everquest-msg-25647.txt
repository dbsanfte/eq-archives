Bottom line is to try and bind where there is nothing dangerous. West
freeport out of the gates is the obvious choice.
You can always run the 50 feet to the guards if something starts whacking
you with no spells or armor, tho my preference would be close to the
zoneline.
Even if youre careful about faction, who knows what Verant might decide to
do with guard faction tables. Interesting to note that initial bind points
are out of the cities (in the cities I have started in anyway)
