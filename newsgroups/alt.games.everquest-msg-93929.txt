| One question....WHY is a cleric engaging in Hand to hand/melee combat?

I'm a level 60 cleric that has been meleeing with her dawnfire on occasion
for over 10 levels. I have fun with melee especially in HS, I can do over 2k
of proc damage per mob. I've not had a problem getting invited back to
groups. Your statement is one made of ignorance. Some diversity for a class
that can be very boring is a good thing. Rather than try to dictate how
other classes play their chars perhaps your time would be better spent
working on your own skills.
