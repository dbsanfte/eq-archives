What of it? I was defending 'my proposed system' and you are attacking 
the 'SWG system'. We already agreed SWGs system, and revision of said 
system is stupid... moving on...

What do dedicated crafters want? To make ultimate weapons they give to 
level one newbies after they've churned them out for everyone else? That 
doesn't benefit the game and harms everybody.

How many people seriously want to log into a video game, move their 
avatar into the shop attached to the back of their house, click on 
swords for 5 or 6 hours then load up the mule to walk to the town square 
where they will shout variations of 'get yer swords ... HEEERE!!' for 
the rest of the day... each time they log in??

No, I think the idea of letting your druid, necro or storm trooper learn 
baking, fletching, and light sabre repair is infinitely preferable to 
the majority of players. Not all of them... but most of them.

Yeah, you need downtime to socialize. Running Hill Runs or LDoN's or 
anything else at breakneck speed doesn't leave much time for typing. Its 
only between the events in the downtime that people can socialize... and 
D2 doesn't have much downtime.

Many of the other MMORGS exhibit the same phenomena - ease of soloing + 
low downtime = low socialization, it has nothing to do with how many 
people are logged into the game.

I don't care for it, but millions of people liked it enough to buy it. 
'Good' is inherently subjective. To say anything objective one has to 
resort to more souless criteria like sales and weeks on the most 
requested list.

As much as cogniscenti here know that, the average joe still fears his 
stuff is gone in 3-months.
