Yes, you could sue them, for your damages, let's see, how much did that box
cost?  Oh damn, the filing fee is more than that.  Personally, if I were in
that situation, I would return the game to the store I bought it at because
it does not work on a machine it says it works on.  I have yet to have a
problem doing that at a store.  If they won't do it, try contacting
Sony/Verant, if they still won't do it, well, you could file in small
claims.
