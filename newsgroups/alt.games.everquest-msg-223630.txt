You can single pull them at 60 or 59.   But my Warrior was unable to solo
them reliably at level 60, so I doubt my Rogue would have all that much
luck.   Without being able to backstab, her damage is only slightly higher
than his, and she does not have the same HP / AC.  Nor is she as well
equipped as he was.
