Since the new Luclin graphics, is there any headgear that is visible on
INT spell casters? I got all the pieces from the Spurned Initiates
quests for my Dark Elf magician and I was a little disappointed that
only the cloak, as usual, was visible. Has Verant ignored the plea's of
the magicians, wizards, and enchanter yet again?
