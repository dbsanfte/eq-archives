I don't know any jewelers on Vaezelle, but I *do* know that you should look at
ruby jewelry. Each piece gives STR and WIS (and trust me: before too long, you
will want WIS.) A silver ruby veil gives 4 STR and 4 WIS and can be had for no
more than 200pp (I think Vaezelle is the newest 'virgin' server; on older
servers it may be as low as 150pp.) Electrum ruby rings give 4 STR and 2 WIS
for about 180pp each, and gold ruby rings give 2 STR and 4 WIS for about 250pp
each.

Imbued ivory gives AC, WIS and v Cold and is wearable by any follower of the
Tribunal (which, being a barb shaman, is your ONLY choice.) Silver ivory
necklace gives 2 AC, 2 WIS and 3 v Cold and should cost more than 15pp
(probably less.) Electrum ivory earrings are 2 AC, 1 WIS and 4 v Cold, gold
ivory earrings are 3 AC, 4 WIS and 4 v Cold and the plat ivory necklace is 5
AC, 5 WIS and 8 v Cold. Note that ivory is a mob drop only gem so availability
and prices will vary widely (I've seen it drop off mobs in their upper 20's and
mid 30's, to give you an idea.)

There is a lot that player made jewelry can do for you. Fire emeralds give STR
and DEX (dexterity, supposedly, will help your spells not fizzle; can't say if
it is true.) The gems cost about 83pp from a merchant, though, so the jewelry
isn't cheap. Pearl, topaz, peridot and emerald jewelry all give AC as well as
nice resist bonuses. Fire opals... I can't say enough good things about fire
opals, they give AC and HP. The stones can be bought in the Temple of Solusek
Ro for 55pp each (no charisma or faction adjustments; her prices are firm.)
They only make rings; with silver you get 2 AC and 30 HP, electrum gives you 3
AC and 35 HP and gold 4 AC and 45 HP. A silver fire opal ring might cost you
65-70pp each to get, but the extra 60 HP you get from a pair will hold you well
for a long time.
