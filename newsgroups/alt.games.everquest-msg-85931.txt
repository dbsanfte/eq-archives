  Yeah, that's what I'd do.  But I can see why people might suggest selling all
your stuff first.  Items tend to go down in platinum value over time.  If you
sell your stuff today, when you get back in a few months, when you go to buy
everything back, you'll probably overall pay less than what you sold the stuff
for... or you'll be able to buy better stuff for around the same amount of
platinum.

  But unless you're "hardcore" or will be away for a pretty good length of time,
I wouldn't bother.
