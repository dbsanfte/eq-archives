	Yeah, I use my real email.  I knew what I was getting myself into,
but this was already a throw-away account and it saved me a lot of hassle
to just use my email.

	So I have been waiting for the spam.

	Strangely, I've only started getting one kind of new spam.  The
nigerian "we want to put $18M in your bank account" kind of spam.  (For
those of you who don't know what I'm referring to...it's a very old form
of scamming people that dates back to before email, and seems to
originate most often in Nigeria.)

	Where is the porn and the work-from-home stuff?  No...I don't get
that boring spam. I'm instead being targetting by nigerians. Very
weird.  Not quite what I'd expect from an EQ newsgroup (and no, I don't
use this email address for any other purposes).
