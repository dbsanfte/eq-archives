On several occasions I heard that killing only one type of mob can reduce
the count of that mob in the zone.  Killing only spider ling in Everfrost
can drastically reduce new spider lings. Also if you only hunt Mammoth,
Mammoth count goes down as well.  I assume this happens do to the fact that
EQ is programmed to pop new mobs as they are killed for the replacement.
But the replacement mob is not directly related to type of mob that was
killed.  Some percentage of new mob comes out as Mammoth or spider ling.  If
I assume 10% of the entire mob comes out as spider ling in Everfronst, 10
out of 100 mob will be spider ling.  If one kills 10 spiders, EQ will add 10
new mobs.  But at 10% spider distribution, which will lead to 1 spider out
of 10 new mob.  A 100 mobs and one spider!

Is this correct?  Is the same principal applies to all the zones?  East FP
for example, some times there are lots of bats flying around and other times
there are no bats at all!  Lately while I am playing I get a message telling
us that "zone repop" is coming up.  What is it?  Is repop re-population of
the zone, to get the right number of mobs?

Emilio.
