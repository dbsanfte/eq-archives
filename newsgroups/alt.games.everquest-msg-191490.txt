If you have a lore item in the bank, you cannot pick up a duplicate of that, not
even to destroy it.  If you have the item on you, you can destroy your copy,
then loot the duplicate... but if its in the bank, you are stuck.

I've never seen bodies overlap so tightly that I couldn't find a single spot
where I could pick up the other item, I can't believe its happened often enough
to complain about, I mean, you'd have to have both that happen, -and- in both
instances the duplicate lore item in the bank problem...

Still, I can't think of any way to resolve it without bringing in outside help,
no "show me the other corpse" command or anything.
