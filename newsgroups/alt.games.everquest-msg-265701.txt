Like I said in my post last night, if you're sensing some frustration, it's
true. I don't deny it, I'm disappointed and feeling bitchy. I usually write
only about my positive experiences, rarely do I detail the bitches. I can
only conclude that it's because the magnitude of the disappointment overcame
my usually stoic nature about the shifting sands of beta. Every person has a
different threshhold for when they stop accepting the "It's beta, get over
it" explanation. I may have just crossed mine.
