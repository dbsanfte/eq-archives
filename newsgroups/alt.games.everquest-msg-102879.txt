yes and no. I have it to, but my family did ALOT to help me deal with it.
Obviously his mother didnt know how to help or thought no one but mommy
could save her son. Where it list she tried to have him in a group home....
yeah theres love for ya. WTF was she thinking- oh I know she was thinking
hey if you move here then I wont have to deal with you anymore.

No wonder the kid blew his head off. and IF HE DIDNT HAVE A GUN HE WOULD
HAVE DONE SOMETHING ELSE. Gun controll can kiss my ass.
