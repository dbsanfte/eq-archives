This if from the Support knowledge base:

  In City of Heroes, the act of "Kill Stealing" is if a player of
  a significant higher level than your hero continues to follow
  you defeating mobs preventing you from gaining any XP or
  Influence for an extended period of time. 

Killing your boss out from under you doesn't qualify. After all,
you still get XP for the minions you defeated.
