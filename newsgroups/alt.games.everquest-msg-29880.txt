I have the reading speed of a snail on Valium ... heavy dose.  What I have
been doing is trying to reduce the number of messages I see in the message
box.  I've pruned them down as much as I can but I'd like to prune them
more.  So can anyone tell me how I can rid myself of:

Dueling messages.  These are rather rare and not much of a problem.  I just
hate seeing them.  I couldn't care less who won a duel.

Spell fizzles.  Oddly, I can eliminate out seeing messages that other people
have cast spells, but I am still notified whenever one of their spells
fails.  Ideally, I'd like to only see spells cast on me or that I cast.

NPC talk.  When I interact with them, its fine and wanted.  But just NPCs
spouting off "witty" remarks in combat all the time just gets annoying.
They maybe have at most three and you see them over and over and over.  I
know they're for color and I don't have a problem with that ... if they'd do
it rarely, but not all the time.  The new Runnyeye is a perfect example.
The messages were cute but lost that cuteness quick with repetition.

Also I wish there was a LFG and /y emergency yell systems so I could turn
off /shout and /ooc.  I'd flip on LFG only when my group needs a member and
I'm the leader and I'd always leave on the /y emergency yell system to
always be able to possibly help someone out.
