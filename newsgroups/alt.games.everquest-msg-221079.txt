    Rogue's don't agro anything like a shaman/mage/wizzy/necro. Not even
close - you can almost accidentally hold agro off a rogue, but if a necro
decides its time to seriously dot, you're hammering keys and still losing
it.

    I guess to qualify my mana statement... holding agro requires
significant mana expenditure, especially if you're *not* using any low level
spell rorts, which will probably be nerfed sooner or later. It probably
doesn't eat all of KEI, but up until recently getting and holding KEI (I
don't know about other tanks in the game but when someone dies in the group
I usually make damn sure it's me) have been a problem for me. I got Pact of
Hate last night, however, and wont be having this problem ever again.

    But as a class with spells that do damage and have other effects, I
don't want to spend 100% of my mana on holding agro. Why do I have all of
those spells? I'm *supposed* to out-damage the other tanks, so when my pet
buys it I like to be able to summon a new one (490 mana later), etc.

    Never had a rogue puller once in 65 levels that I recall. These days I
group with the same people, usually just the same 2 other guys - a shaman
and a mage. If you've got an SK in the group and he *isn't* oom, you'd be
hard pressed to find a better puller in most situations. I might also add
that as a group MT, being the guy who damages the mob *First* is one of the
most important ways to hold agro that I've come across.

    Hmm and I've noticed that most people don't actually *like* pulling. I
have no idea why this is, it's one of my favorite parts of the game.

    Agro control? Consisting of what? Waiting until the warrior had taken
the mob down to 80% before nuking? Where's the brain power or fun in that?
