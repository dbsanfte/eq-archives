Awww... when the title said 'good character,' I thought you'd decided to try
the challenge of siding with the underdogs.  (Life with the Good Team _is_
much more exciting, if you want my opinion.  With all of Kunark and almost
half of Antonica, life among the Evil Team can get pretty boring at
times...might as well play on a Blue server, and just /duel every once in a
while.  Besides, with the Good Team, you can make a real difference, and
become a hero...in Team Evil, you're just one more grunt.)

If you're going to be Evil, choose the excitement of being isolated in
Paineel :-).

Certain classes do better in PvP combat than in combat against NPC's.
Enchanters are a decent example....I've been Tashaned, Enfeebled, and mezzed
to the point where my only option was to Gate.

Clerics have some interesting options in PvP that (in my opinion) make them
pretty good escape artists.  So far, soloing a cleric in PvP, I've never had
a foe who was equally matched to me succeed in killing me....Divine Aura,
Gate, Flash of Light, Root, Holy Might, etc. work well to help you get away
when things go bad.  (I don't know how things go for clerics in PvP past
level 20 yet, so take that into consideration).

All the classes you listed are pretty good choices when it comes to PvP.
Choose the class you enjoy playing and know well, then learn their PvP
quirks.
