It's a LOT faster.

It didn't used to be a guaranteed interrupt - sometimes you could channel
through it.  But then Verant found out that on long-casting spells, people
would sit down, then stand up just as the spell timer went off so that they
could get in a couple of extra ticks worth of med time.

People getting 5 or 6 extra mana somehow violated The Vision(tm), so that
ability was nerfed by making spells interrupt as soon as you sat down.  A
side effect made them interruptable by ducking, too.
