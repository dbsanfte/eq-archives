Well, I use mine for EQ now.  You're right, if I scroll up and down 
fast, it does smear, but in EQ, it doesn't seem to do anything like 
that, which is nice considering how fast one must move sometimes ;)  I 
really dunno how good a CRT would be in comparison though, because the 
only CRT I played on was a piece of junk by the time I got EQ.
