Tanking ability is also defined by taunting ability, is it not? Not many
groups will consider someone a tank that has trouble getting a mob off a
caster. I mean how can you be tanking if you can't keep the mob on you? In
my experience a warrior or pal/sk always makes a better tank.

Anyways I'm not too worried about him being correct. If it were true then it
would greatly unbalance the game and you guys would just take a nerf.
Pal/sk's pay for their lower damage output by the fact they can tank and
cast. Monks have high damage output. Verant would not give monks high damage
output and best tanking ability til lvl 53.
