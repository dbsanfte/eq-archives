Hello;

This is just a quick post to let people know that YALP version 2.2 is
now available for download at http://members.shaw.ca/yalp. If you dont
know, YALP is yet another log parser for EverQuest.

With this release, YALP has really become a best of breed log parser.
YALP can provide a full accounting of all damage to and from each
party found in a log file including stats such as Damage Per Second
and Attack Delay on every damage list. Reports can now be generated in
HTML for viewing, printing or placing on a web page. YALP 2.2 now also
provides some support for online log processing, and is still one of
the fastest log parsers available.

Visit the YALP homepage and try it for yourself, you really do have to
see it to believe it. Please help me to make YALP the best log parser
around by leaving your comments or suggestions on the YALP forums.

Thanx, and Happy EQ'ing!

Thulie Clovus
