  That probably is the best solution.  By level 42 I couldn't stand playing
EQ anymore with my druid.  My shadow knight is level 43 now, and despite my
mariginal soloing ability and the difficulty I sometimes have finding
groups, I'm enjoying EQ a lot more than I ever did with my druid.  I was
never particularly antisocial, when I was playing a class than wasn't
particularly sought after in groups, and a character that HAD the option of
soloing with some effectiveness, too often I found myself alone and it was a
pretty miserable experience.

  The more I think about, the more I hate my old druid. :P
