2 sites of interest to bards:

http://pub105.ezboard.com/btheconcerthall.html

and

http://www.eqdiva.com/

The concert hall is a message board that seems
to have higher level bards. EQDiva is a web site
and message board and has really good
information. In particular, I recommend Reed's
song spreadsheet.

If you haven't been to Katta Castellum on
Luclin- you need to go. Best city for a bard in
the game.
I have a theory, it could be bunnies....
........................or maybe midgets
