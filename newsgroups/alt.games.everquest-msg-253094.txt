Thanks for the info.  I don't necessarily need a green location to
solo in, I've got most of this class down so far.  Seb is a good one,
as is lower guk I think (dead side especially) just for fun.  I have
yet to use DC, itching to try it.  It's not so fun having charm drop
on you when you're close to naked and get beat to mush.

I was also looking at Veksar.  Someone recommended this zone for
plat/loot.  Checked it out quickly the other day but have yet to
really explore and hunt.
