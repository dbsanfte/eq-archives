If a pet is on the mob - you can be sure the mob is not on your group.
Beast mezzing...  That's a mana save for you.

I grouped with another BST yesterday, in about 1.5 hours we each
cleared at least 4 orange.  Pulled 2 - 4 at a time and then sic'd pets
on different mobs and played pet cleric if we needed to rebuild STA a
bit.  The pets are pretty tough!

We can all say it is poor pet control, but if you have two mobs
beating on one Beast's warder, all the /pet back off s in the world
ain't gonna work - unless a miracle occurs and the mobs change
target..  but then that mob is gonna start beating on someone in your
group.
