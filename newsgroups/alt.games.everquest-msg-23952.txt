 Yeah, Covenant series is a pretty serious read. Not the sort of thing
I'd recommend for a cruise trip. I liked the series and have kept up
with most of his stuff (Mirror and Gap series) but I don't remember much
about it. Maybe it's time to read it again. That's a fairly big
undertaking though. Presently rereading LoTR before the movie is
released. They better not mess it up.
