If it took 3 or 4 minutes I don't think anyone would care.  But keep in mind,
I've joined groups that took at LEAST 30 minutes to get organized and to the
zoneline.  It's frustrating as HELL, and I've been tempted several times to
jump ship because of all the shenanigans.  We waited for a guy one day for 20
minutes.  I finally sent him a tell.  He'd changed his mind and didn't know
whose group he had agreed to join so he couldn't send the inviter a tell!! 
Another guy had us standing around for ages while he got his adventurers stone!
 Then there are the people who forgot to get food and water before getting to
the dungeon.  
I'm picturing standing around in BB for another 20 minutes AFTER the adventure
waiting for some shmuck to run to the bank to get plat, then discover he's 20
plat short, then try to bum some from a friend, and half an hour later you're
still waiting for your share of the loot.... 
I'm realistic, and probably impatient too.
I also tend to be prompt and thoughtful.  If all players were this wouldn't be
an issue at all.
