Mere mortals! Look forward ye to "Legend of Y'bullshit"

Exciting new features abound in this content-packed expansion, such as:

1) teleport maps! We realise we didn't go quite far enough in having
everyone stare at a map interface that looks like the cheats to rise of the
triad all day, so now you just click on the map wherever you need to be and
you're teleported there. Works across zones. Thanks Mojo for the suggestion.

2) Easier banking: Every character class (except rangers) can now buy a
"Credit Gem" which lets them bank at any merchant. Higher level characters
can hire a banker to follow them everywhere so they can bank while fighting.
Except rangers, rangers are now KOS to all bankers.

3) New inventory slot: Balms! Balms can interract with the world in
fascinating ways, and although poisonous to Rangers Balms can do amazing
things for your character that are unlike any other inventory slot - such as
add AC, resists, mana or hitpoints. Some examples include the Immunity to
Everything Balm, and the Imbue Self with Essence of Doing 100x Normal Damage
To Dragons And Gods Balm. Another new exciting Balm reduces the chance to
fail on any tradeskill combine to zero, irrespective of the 900 hours you
didn't spend on skillups.

4) Level-up potions will now be saleable at all merchants, and many formerly
hostile mobs will now just walk up and give them to you.

5) We have deleted freeport and replaced it with a Disneyland. The humans
have been chased out by giant stuffed toys and escaped to Nektulos forest,
where they were promptly slaughtered and eaten by ravening leatherfoot
halflings and pissed off trolls. Thanks Disney for the new sponsorship deal.
All players who camped out in freeport last night have been turned into
giant stuffed toys. All quests that used to work in freeport will now have a
very Disney theme. But wont work.

6) All trade skills up to 250 can now be purchased at any bank, unless you
are a Ranger.

7) A "solo" button has been added for mentally crippled druids.

8) Rangers are no longer allowed to group with other classes

9) We have added a new "automate warrior" button for clerics. Having
realised our total failure to provide anything interesting for warriors to
do, we have simply automated the class. The Warrior Control Panel includes
two levels of taunting: Auto-Mash for those clerics who havent worked out
how taunt works yet, and Mash When I lose Agro for those who've joined the
dots and seen the pony.

10) Shadowknights can now attain the AA ability "Manaburn" with the
exception that it is stackable for that class

11) Except for Rangers, death no longer counts. When you normally would've
died, you will respawn in the same spot with all your equipment and 100%
health and mana.

12) Rangers can no longer use the "attack" key

13) 5 new levels have been added, with exciting new abilities for all
classes:
    * Warriors can now be 5 levels higher
    * rangers can now obtain the tradeskill "Knitting" at level 70
    * New druid spell: Summon all Hill Giants in Rathe To Me And Kill And
Loot Them
    * New bard song: Illusion: Hetrosexual
    * New Enchanter Spell: Charm Ranger
    * New shadowknight pet: Foraged Vegetables
    * and more!

14) New playable race: Foraged Vegetables

15) Enhanced "looking for twink" tool lets you restrict membership of your
group to people who are twinked to a certain levels. You can set this to
anything from 100pp worth of gear to "top level cultural armour at level 3"

Legend Of Y'bullshit costs only $300US and can be downloaded 63 times (as we
patch and repatch our programming fuckups weeks before the release) just by
ticking a box once. If you dont tick the box and pay the money we will drop
all of your characters a level a day until they are completely destroyed,
starting tomorrow.

Remember, if you dont like any of the new features that come out with
"Legend Of Y'bullshit", DON'T USE THEM YOU FREAKING LUDDITE. Your next door
neighbour's braindamaged five year old kid will be soloing gods with his
week-old level 70 druid, but you're quite welcome to hang around in the
dreadlands by yourself trying to level your Ranger up the boring old
fashioned way.

To die the old fashioned way if you dont have a ranger, simply take note of
when you would ordinarily have bought the farm, transfer all your gear to a
friend, and equip your "port me to my bind point naked" balm.

Cheers,
James

PS I sincerely apologise if this post actually pisses anyone off, I honestly
wrote it purely as a laugh, and am still a little bit drunk from last night
so if I missed the point a bit, please write your complaints in to Disney.
