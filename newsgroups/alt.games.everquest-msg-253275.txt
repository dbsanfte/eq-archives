That was rather the point of using it as the example, an example of an, 
and I quote: "environment where people don't realize it." ["it" being 
"you're roleplaying". I maintain that the mall is an excellent choice of 
such a venue.

A mmorpg -should be-. EQ is decidely -not-. EQ is like the 'costume 
party' where 1 guy shows up in a costume and the other 29 guests do not. 
Its still a party, but 1 guy in 30 wearing a cape and mask doesn't make 
it a costume party, at least not to the vast majority of the guests.

I owe them nothing.

Yeah, your message got through loud and clear.

I for one think its the far more defensible position that when 
interacting with others, its poor form to communicate so badly that 
players don't know whether they are talking to *you* or *your fabricated 
  character* or where the boundaries are.

If your too ambiguous or other players are too dense to figure it out, I 
would either correct them or stop interacting with them.

You evidently disagree.

Now where do you stand on the situation where someone *deliberately* 
communicates so badly that others get the wrong idea. In dealing with 
you at least if there is misunderstadning -- even though you won't 
correct it -- you aren't trying to create it. What of those who actively 
create it for their amusement?

Personally I think your attitude to the situation is pushing antisocial 
(and true to form I'm sure you couldn't care less), and I think someone 
who actively amuses themselves by doing it as in the case of the subject 
of the OP is getting into the 'sick fuck' realm.

But that's just my opinion.
