I tried this this morning, and it is viable toe to toe, although only 
just.  I have 85% cast haste plus a 11% haste item, but no slow.  Armed 
and fitted out with a full kit of plate plus belt, my pet still can't 
kill one bug by himself, I have to nuke for about 4k damage.

The mobs can be single pulled if I pick the right ones and watch angles; 
they are social but seem to have a fairly short social range.  Bonus is 
that they are indifferent until engaged, so I can walk around and 
examine things fairly freely, although I still have to avoid some 
mushrooms and the like scattered thru the area.

I pulled my first time up to the Twilight Sea line, and got three.  Two 
on my pet and one chasing me.  Well, I was able to see that they two 
bugs can eat my pet fairly quickly if he's not supported... and then I 
zoned out.

Came back in, set up again, pulled to the same spot, but this time 
making sure I had the nearest bug and pulled with Cancel Magic, which is 
the least aggro causing pull I have (although if I can get LOS, a very 
low level bolt from maximum range sometimes can get single pulls where 
Cancel can't, because I have to be much closer for that).  Got just one, 
and between pet and a couple nukes got him down to running... which 
rapidly got scary, as he was running unslowed towards his buddies which 
devastated me the first time.  Then my pet turned around and came back 
to me, bug still at 17%.  He'd dropped off the side of ramp or 
something.  I should have zoned out, but didn't, wandered slowly back 
down the ramp passing bugs which all conned indiff, meaning my target 
hadn't gotten in talking range of them.  Finally I got to a point where 
my pet dropped invis again and went off for the kill.  I never did find 
the mob, but pet killed it, didn't aggro anything, I got exp... so it 
turned out well.

I managed to single pull and kill several more bugs before I got an add, 
I think a repop (the add happened about halfway thru a kill, and neither 
the battling duo nor I had moved during the battle at all).  I got the 
add onto my pet, then tried to salvage things by heavy healing, using 
both my HOT and both my top two direct heals... things floated along at 
under 20% hp for my pet for a bit till the HOT wore off, then I lost 
him.  I ran around and up the ramp, then to the twilight sea exit again, 
passing by several groups of two or three bugs, even running straight 
thru them, no aggro.

That was about all I had time for.  Killed about 6 bugs, got about 1% 
normal exp in 63, in about an hour's play... but not highly efficient 
play as I was still playing around with how to work things and where to 
fight and so on.  I don't think I can take two at once unless I can get 
some kind of buff cast on the pet, though; maybe if they were both on 
him from the start instead of me having to run around while the first 
one gets my pet down on HP...

Didn't try kiting.

Collected about 60pp in various parts, including some ichor that said it 
was for trade skills... I sold it before looking, dunno if thats a "keep 
this and Trader Mode it" item

I'm not sure this is what I'm looking for, as the travel time to get to 
it is pretty long, POK to Nexus, short run,  to Shadowhaven, short run, 
then a long run thru... that zone who's name I can't recall with the 
needlites... then another long run thru Fungusgrove.  Further, its 
indoors, which cuts my mana regen substantially; I'm not mounted while 
casting nor while waiting for aggro from a good nuke to die back down 
(they are pretty touchy about getting hit for 15% of their HP total, it 
seems)

On the bright side, it certainly isn't a complete waste of time, like 
sitting around POK or popping from magus to magus accross the LDoN lines 
hoping for a group:)

Splendid One, 63 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
