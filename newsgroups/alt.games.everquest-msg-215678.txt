Someone else already mentioned Ulthorks.

How: same as any other level.  If you haven't quadded before now,
though, here's a brief tutorial.

SoW yourself (should go without saying, but there it is).

Find outdoor mobs that you can kill easily.  The ones you can barely
take down via root and rot, or your single target nuke and run, are
NOT quaddables.  Well maybe they are, but only if you get lucky or
are willing to spend a long time, which isn't the point.  If you
look at the damage per mana ratio of your quad nukes, you'll find
that on a single target basis they suck; you have to be able to kill
each mob with that nuke... and factor in some resists and some "oops
he wasn't in range" hits.  So the mob has to be dead easy for you to
efficiently kill 4 at a time.

You also need the mobs to be pullable in ones or twos, and to find a
nice open space for running around where you won't get adds.  This
is one of the reasons Ulthorks are good; there's tons of open space
over along the beaches with no roamers at all.

Find a mob, pull him with Ensnare.  Run ahead of him till you stick
snare, then circle back and get another, another, another.  Now run
the ragged band off to your open area, and start running circles
around them.  You do this because initially they are spread out
pretty far, and you need them clustered so tightly that they are
rubbing each other's shoulders.  When you get the circling down
right it compresses them all into that tight pattern.  Now run
straight a bit to get far enough away from them that you can stop
(spin a little in place to make sure the server knows you stopped)
then cast your AE nuke on one of the mobs; it should hit all four if
you have them clustered tight enough.  Run ahead till your nuke
refreshes, repeat.  Keep an eye on the group, if it gets split up
you have to come back and circle them up again.  Other than that,
repeat till a mob dies; if its your target, pick a new target out of
the cluster.  When you get down to one or two mobs, you may want to
switch to single target nukes, or DOTs; particularly handy for
finishing off that one last mob which is in RIP (Running in Place)
mode; either way the idea is that you no longer are getting good
damage per AE nuke, because its only hitting one or two targets.

Now loot up, then sit down and go do the dishes or something; yes
you killed 4 mobs on the mana it would have cost to kill 2... but
killing 2 mobs in a row would have blown out all your mana too.

I reccomend trying it on some really wimpy mobs like elephants in SK
before you go after actual exp/loot mobs; getting the circling
around part and the running ahead parts down is very important, you
need those mobs packed tight, and then any mistake in timing means 4
mobs beating on you at once, this can be disasterous.
