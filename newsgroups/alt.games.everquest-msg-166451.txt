Do you play with your game's resolution different from the desktop? On mine,
until I went in and 'tweaked' a bit, I would have problems with frequency
differences ( the frequency default for the res I was running in was 56hz,
which causes me eyestrain).
There is now a setting for frequency in the options menu... try setting that
as high as you can get away with on your monitor.
Another thing that has helped me greatly is I now use a pointer that is
significantly larger, and a bright red, thus easier to see (I would lose the
pointer in 'messy' environments, with lots of effects going on). That
reduces eyestrain because I'm not straining and glancing to pickup the
pointer in mid fight.
If you want I could cut that little bit out of my custom skin and put it
somewhere you can get to it.
make sure the various chat colors stand out well for you. Takes a lot of
tweaking for me to get good contrast and distinct colors.
Make sure your monitor gives a good 'sharp' picture. I had to replace mine
because one of it's magnets (which was supposed to be permanently mounted)
was letting the whole picture get out of focus, and I couldn't get to to
sharpen back up.
Also, look at the way that your play environment is different (likely) from
your work environment. Make sure the area is well lit, but not from an angle
that produces glare. Lower the brightness and contrast a little on your
monitor... the less 'glow' it puts out the better. Get an anti glare filter
for your monitor ($10.00). If you can, borrow an LCD display from someone
(I've actually seen a place you can rent 15" lcd's from for about $30.00 a
week, not bad as a test) and see if that helps any. Get a pair of polarized
sunglasses (such as for fishing or shooting) in the lightest tint you can
(My eyeglasses are glare polarized without tint, though that is expensive.),
that will likely cost $20.00 for a decent pair (don't get the $5.00
polarized glasses.. those are worse than plain glass)
I know one guy that CANNOT play anything with a 3d environment without
headaches, motion sickness, etc, unless he wears 3d glasses. That seems a
bit odd, and a bit of an extreme step to me.

Make sure you are not doing this 'on top of' everything else you are doing.
you could simply be tiring yourself out. As another person said, I get eye
ticks and headaches starting about once every couple of months and realize I
am pushing to much stuff onto my schedule (not just EQ) and need to back off
some.
