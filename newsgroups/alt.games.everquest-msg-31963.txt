I tried several times to camp him and usually after a few hours i had become
so bored that i gave up, then one day I got the camp right after someone had
killed him and gotten their ring, so I parked my pet at the spawn point (was
playing my shaman) and i raced around befallen killing anything that moved
(this was before the nastier mobs were put in and I was alone in their so
noone would complain lol) I figured I had a long camp ahead of me, well i
did this for mabey 10 minutes and I heard him shout across the zone, of
course i had made it to the basement by then and had to race all the way
back up. I searched the top floor and slowly made my way down when I noticed
I was no longer alone in the zone a level 50 rogue had come in at some
point, it turned out he had gotten the kill and the ring. I was a bit upset
but it was my own fault for leaving the spot but this wonderful rogue
actually gave me the plat ring. I still give him a hug whenever i race by
him =) Not everyday some actually gives away an item like that just to be
nice. So after spending several times camping it for hours on end i actually
got a spawn that took less than 15 mins from his last spawn, so my guess
would be it's a random spawn. I've also been told to kill anything that
spawns in his place, which you can usualy hear screeching across the zone
(skels and rats will give some sort of shout when they spawn there that you
can hear from the second floor)
