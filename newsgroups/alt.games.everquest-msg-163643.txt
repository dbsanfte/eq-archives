I didn't say that it was proc-ing more, but it odd that it was proc-ing
without me hitting the target.

What happened was I got two procs over about 1 minute, then hit for some
damage and it proc'd, so I got three procs, and only hit for damage once.
Like I said, it usually procs 3-4 times per fight, more or less.

From what you are saying with the T-Staff, is that the proc has nothing to
do with hitting the target. Perhaps, as many others have suggested when
talking about back-to-back procs, that they are on a timer.
