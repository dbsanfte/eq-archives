OMG!!!  I have noooo sympathy then...  You chose to camp something so that
someone else who genuinely needed it, couldn't, and then whine that it
doesn't spawn for you?  sorry...  No sympathy whatsoever....

Sorry, when I need cash, I normally camp a cash spawn, such as Gornit (when
I was lower), or Ice Giants....  Much better cash rate than a random RARE
spawn...
