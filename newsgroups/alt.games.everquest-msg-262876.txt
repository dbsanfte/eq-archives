Sounds like a dreary period of time to me. First you farm pp, then you 
mindlessly click combine. Rinse and repeat. I can can handle tradeskills 
'as I progress' but to spend 'serious amounts of time and money' on them 
at once is more like work than actual work is ... to me at least.

This is a case where you completely missed what I said. I didn't so much 
as breath a word about kill stealing, or even camp claiming.

Either you get squat from farming plat or you don't. Clearly you get 
quite a bit. Ironically it seems like your spending the pp you farm on 
large segments of an even more boring activity: "clicking combine". 
Hopefully at the end of it you'll actually be able to do something fun.

But I doubt it... I figure you'll see a need to farm pp for a lot longer 
than you'll even see a need to play to EQ. Perhaps that is *why* you'll 
give up on EQ... many others before you have burned out farming plat and 
realizing they will never have enough.

I regret that you haven't had much luck finding work. But surely you are 
aware that yours is a more unusual case.
