He guessed, I didn't.  In fact when I hit the reply button I meant to
tell him that he was wrong, assuming it was like most newbie zones
with a 100 ZEM.  Turns out it, like several others, is a 75.

...is one list.  There are several of them around.  I would assume
these data are pretty easy to accumulate so the ZEMs are probably
accurate.  All you would need to do is count how many exp points you
get for killing a level x whatever and control for various bonuses. 
(Don't group, dont kill stuff at or above your level, etc...)
