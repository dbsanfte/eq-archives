Well, as I said, I think that is interesting and possibly crippling.

But I wonder if its true; when you say "itemization" are you thinking 
about everyone in similar "I only loot stuff that drops off mobs I kill" 
situations, or are you thinking about other classes besides MT's being 
in far better than "expected" gear, like they are now?

Running a Hardcore character on a SNAFU (situation normal, all Mudflated 
  up) world, where groups expect to face red mobs and stare them down 
due to their tank's AC and HP is indeed tough, and toughest on the tanks.

But when all tanks are in the same boat, would groups just abandon the 
tank model, or would they start going after easier mobs; shooting for 
white or high dark blues where they would once have shot for red or yellow?
