This one is pretty much unnecessary.

I like to have this one announced, it makes some difference
in my tanking strategy.

>Chanter tells the group, 'debuffing magic resistance for a an Uglymob'

This one's entirely necessary many times -- other casters
often hold off nuking until they hear that the mob
has been tashed, so that they don't waste mana on spells
that may just bounce off the critter.

It's unnecessary if mobs are not very MR to start with,
but in cases where they're likely to resist until tashed,
then I really want to know when they have been.

I'd rather have too much information than not enough.  Every
bit of info I have about the fight helps me to better
wage it.
