   That is a very good write up of the ranger class.  And yes, it is too
long. 

   That's the problem with doing just a paragraph or two write up.  They
are extremely brief, and they are not going to exhaustibly correct because
of it.  Yes, I believe there might be rangers that tank in high end pop
content.  But in general terms, the higher the level the content, the more
likely one is to have a plate class doing the tanking.  Level 50 was a
somewhat arbitrary point to say this happens, of course, but I think it was
as good a one as any.

   Remember, these write ups are not meant to teach new players everything
there is to know about a particular class.  Far from it.  They are simply
meant to give a brief "flavor" of what each class is about.  We're talking
in generalities here, not in absolutes.
