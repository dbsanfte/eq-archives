I never said you would lie about wizards soloing expertise, I said
that I found it hard to believe that you could kill 60 exp-giving mobs
an hour.  Not that you could kill 4 mobs in 4 minutes, but that you
could keep that kill rate up.

I am well aware of wizards AE abilities, both grouped and solo.  I
tend to hang out with some pretty competant wizards.

Well, I would have to make a character, and get them up to a level
where they could survive the trip to CS, and co-ordinate the timing,
so I'm gonna take your word that you can kill 4 mobs in 4 minutes.
I'm still going to ask you to confirm that you can keep that kill rate
up for an hour.

Ummm, I'm a level 59 bard, with well over 100 days /played.  I am
fully aware of wizards soloing ability, especially in CS.  Unless you
can break the tower also, I can't see how you could even get 60 mobs
an hour to spawn in CS, but maybe the respawn is faster than I
thought.  (I've never seen a wizard work the tower, generally bards,
but I would think a druid could also.)
I just ran the numbers at http://eq.stratics.com/crmaps/eqexp.html,
and it looks like it takes about 160 wyverns to make it from 51 to 52,
so maybe 32 per yellow bubble.  I guess 8 quads an hour, which seems
about right to me.  Still not close to 60 mobs an hour, and you're in
the best zone in the game for quad-kiting.

Sheesh, would it have helped if I had said some wizards don't have a
sense of humor.  (Anything after my name is for informational or
comedic value only.)  I'm a frickin bard for Bristlebane's sake,
technically an INT-based class, with an INT of 78!  When I bust on
wizards/necros/mages, it's because you guys have like three times my
INT!  (Well, and the fact that bards seem to be better raidleaders.)

I'm not disputing the fact that you can do a single quad-kite in 4
minutes.  I am disputing that you can keep that pace going for an
hour.  If you want to run your logs, I think you would find it really,
really hard to keep that up for even 20 minutes.  I mean I could run
up to the tower, pull the whole bunch, and kill them in about 5
minutes, and end up waiting on the respawn.  It doesn't mean I can
kill 75 in an hour.
