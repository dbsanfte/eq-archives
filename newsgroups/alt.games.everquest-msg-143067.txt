I don't play a Necro so I may be wrong, but as I understand it this pet 
is *supposed* to be researched by Necros. Shadow Knights can't research 
spells, so since they get the same pets as Necromancers but only at a 
much higher level, its available at Shadow Knight guilds. I would bet 
this spell is also available at the Human Shadow Knight guild too, which 
you would probably not be KOS to. Otherwise you will need to research it.
