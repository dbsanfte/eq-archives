Its easy to balance this...:

More features a class has - Less power features.
Less features a class has - More powerful features.

Druids have so many features, that the only way to balance them is to
restrict how powerul use those features can get. Druids should never go
beyond 50% of the power any other true class has in its primary field.
Already i believe that druids are over 50% as powerful as other classes are
in their primary skills within nuking, porting, snaring, DoT'ing, DS'ing.
I'm glad to see a balance that knocks them under 50% efficiency within
healing.
