I think there's something you can set in your eqclient.ini file,
but I'm not at the right computer now so I can't check what it's
called.

Basically there's an entry that says when's the last time they
popped up the ad for you.  (The time is given as a large number,
approximately 1094000000.  It's the number of seconds since the
start of 1970.  Don't ask why. :-)  The entry name has something
about Omens or OOW in it.  EQ pops up the ad if the current time
is "enough later" than the last time it thinks it bugged you.
So  if you change the number to something large enough, like
1200000000 (which represents a time somewhere in 2008), EQ won't
pop up the ad again until that time passes.

This technique was first mentioned (in my experience) back when
it was the Gates or perhaps even LDON ad that was popping up, and
changing the eqclient.ini file dealt with it, so I tried the same
thing for Omens and it's worked fine.  Been weeks since I last saw
the ad.
