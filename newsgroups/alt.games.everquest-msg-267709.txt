Sounds like your doctor(s) were as sloppy as mine.  I spent 4 months buying
medicine (at $90 a pop) for ulcers before they finally decided it was
gallstones.  Got mine jerked, too.  I don't get pain from it, 'cause it
ain't there.

I don't know if your gallstone pain was like mine, but for me it was like
someone had hollowed me out and then lit a fire inside me.  Everything in
the abdominal cavity felt like it was literally burning.


Ras, drink lots of fluid, yes, but also don't go to the bathroom.  Hold it
as long as physically possible, like, say, drink 2 quarts and then don't go
for 14 hours.  When you do, it's firehose time and you may be able to wash
it through in one long blast.
