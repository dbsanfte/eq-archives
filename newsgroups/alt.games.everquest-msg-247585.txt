 Probally my fault as well. I'd say 3 of those were before I found out
about the /assist command. I had been using F8 before that. Targeted
on mob that I thought was getting attacked by group then wonder why my
pet runs off down the hall. Found out when the 4 mobs came back
looking for the one who sent it. I got my enitre group killed. I
couldn't apologize enough that time.

 I'm not experienced with all caster groups. I even got temp and
melee'd my necro alongside a pally.
