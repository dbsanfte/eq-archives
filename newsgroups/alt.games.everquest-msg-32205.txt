Haha, yes, if you are playing with a new group, or tank, it makes em worry when
you let them berzerk, LOL.

I would hope that you are an experienced enough Cleric to know exactly how much
damage per tic your tank can take, and be mindful of a ten second cast. I group
with several tanks and they trust I am doing my job.BUT... I still get a few
"heal" tells, means I worry them, hehe.

Casting Celestial gives you time to med, but CH is still more mana efficient.
Several mobs also poses a timing challenge for your cast.

good luck
