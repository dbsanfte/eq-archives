What utter bullshit.
6 extra clerics or rogues doesn't completely remove a dragon's AoE.
MOST of the dragon encounters are difficult BECAUSE of their AoE!

Their melee damage output is sufficiently tuned down to compensate for
their AoE.  You find a way to negate their AoE and the encounter is a
total joke.

It didn't make paladins useful at high end games.  It BROKE high end
games!

The reason why dragons like Aaryonarr, Zlexak, Sontalak are difficult
is BECAUSE of their AoE.  It sure as fuck ain't because they're such a
tough melee mob...
