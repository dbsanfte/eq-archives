I'm quite sure they do a save to the server every time you transfer / drop an
item, etc.   If they have read the Laws of Online Game Design at least once,
they would know better than to make that client side information.   "Never,
ever trust the client.   The client is in the hands of the enemy."  is one of
the prominent rules. ;)
