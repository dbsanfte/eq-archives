When you want to, yes.

But many effect, such as the invisibility you mention, aren't improved 
by the instrument, either they work or they don't.

And many of those that are improved by instrument are still quite often 
with no instrument at all, as swapping out weapons in order to lay the 
instrument in hand at the right time and then back fast enough not to 
lose much DPS while still twisting can be...wearing, and many bards just 
don't bother unless its a really desperate time.

Having a so so "instrument" thats always there means when you don't swap 
the "real" instrument in, you at least aren't just humming the tune.
