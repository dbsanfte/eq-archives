Once upon a time, mobs killed solely by a secondary wave of an AE
rain would poof.  I think (but cannot confirm) that thats been
fixed.  But it sure would be a pisser to go thru all the trouble
of killing an infrequently popped semi-boss who death touches,
just to see your reward vanish from an overeager mage's waste of
a spell (the wave that kills the broodling -must- hit after the
real target is dead, cause if he's alive the broodling isn't
there yet)
