Aye, I'm referring to the new female human plate helms.  I can barely
remember the old model human female helms.  I wish I could remember all of
the velious helmets better. I have vague recollections of seeing some
really funky high elf female helm with a huge plume or some such, and of
course the wood elf male graphic ala helm of the tracker is a common one
to see...but it'd be neat if there were a page of just these helms.
