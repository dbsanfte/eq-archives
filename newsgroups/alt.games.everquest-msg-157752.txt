I am.  I said so several times.

Both.

I'm happy for their increased welfare, and upset that I don't have much left
I can use to help them.

And, I'm GLAD you're not stuck anymore.  I DO think this is a good move, but
I think it's only HALF a move.

If they made Resurrections free, it would benefit everyone in the game.
Clerics would still be useful, and nothing would have been taken from them.

Still, something MAJOR that they had to offer the rest of the gamers would
have been rendered obsolete, and they should be given something to take it's
place in this case.

In the case of Druids, this is even MORE necessary, since at least clerics
would still be the best healers.  We have a lot of SMALL abilities that we
can use to help, but NOTHING we are the best at.

BTW, thank you for being reasonable in this post.  I had no idea that this
simple concept would cause so many flames.
