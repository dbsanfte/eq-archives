The "newbie server" tag on Stromm is actually misleading now days.
It's the most recent non-transfer or split server, but by now, it's
pretty much the same as every other server out there. The server they
opened earlier this week is allowing transfers, so it's not really
gonna be different, either. There really is no "best" server to start
on as a newbie.
