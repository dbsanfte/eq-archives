I died once at low level in nektulos coz a guy was killing guards. This is
what i did :

I agroed a decaying skelton, i run near guard, but not too close. Now i have
a decaying skelly following me and a guard following my squelly, i run up to
the 2nd guard and agroed it with my skely, i ran to the 3rd and a 4th agroed
too (the big one at neriak entrance).

I was at this moment running with a skely and 4 guards, i ran to the guy
killing guards on the bridge and i shout :Train ! squelton to bridge !!

I stoped running near the guy ...
