OK, Lvl 40 Druid going near the river in EK and on my tracking screen is a
blank line. No name. No characters, nothing. Just a blank line.

Being the curious sort, I start tracking the thing an find it's at the
bottom of the river. I wade out a bit and find that it's also quite
invisible. I F8 to target it, and it cons red.

Again, being the curious sort, I decide to see if I can root it, or at least
get it to chase me. I'm very close to the bridge, and I have GWF up, so I
figure I'll give it a gamble.

You begin casting Ensnaring Roots.
 resists your Ensnaring Roots spell.
 hits you for 250 points.
 hits you for 20000 points. You have been slain by !

Ok, what sort of nameless thing hits for twenty thousand points? Anyone? Is
this thing _supposed_ to be there?

I remember once upon a time, there was supposed to be a creature in Lake
Rathe, but he's have to be a long way from home. Any ideas?

Seriously, I've seen more anomalies in EK than just about any other zone.
Hill Giants regularly pop _under_ the hill, there is a NPC that appears at
the crossroads named ! with one hit point... sometimes two or three copies
of him at the same time. When I was retrieving my corpse there was a patch
of grass under the water where I could breathe. I could see water above,
grass below, and sky at the horizon.

Any other zones this buggy?
