My best and earliest memories of EQ involve travel.  A friend took me
from Gfay to Surefall.  He had just acquired SOW as the allmighty,
high level 14th druid ;). I died in EK (Broon, I think, not sure now)
and got chased through quite a few other zones and had a horrible
death by falling into that big waterhole in blackburrow.  But it sure
was fun.  Maybe it's not the highest priority in the EQ world for me,
but travelling the zones on foot gave me a chance to unfold some of
the stories EQ intended (I think) a lot of us to see (meaning, I,
personally, appreciate more some of the quests with the context of
distance applied).  Even if you're not into the roleplaying aspects of
EQ, I think travelling the continents by foot, even if only once,
gives a perspective to the game that leads one to a greater mastery of
the EQ universe. You'll definitely appreciate more that sow, port or
other assistance that let's you focus more easily on the task at hand
if you've gone walkabout in EQ than if you had not hoofed it at all.
