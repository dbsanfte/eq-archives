The difference between feminists and chauvinists is insignificant, and I
don't really care for either, because they are both narrow-minded. Thinking
of varying perspectives as "male" and "female", rather than simply
"different", is in itself "sexist". No, actually, it's ridiculously
immature and plain silly.

I spoke to an American friend today, and I asked her what she'd think if I
called her a "pussy". Her spontaneous response was, "a wimp". Perhaps the
self-appointed defenders of women need to spend more time in the real world
and speak to females who stand with both feet on the ground.

Certainly, "pussy" has other meanings, at least one of them clearly vulgar.
Just why would he have called some guy, who started crap and then backed
out cowardly, a vagina? Does that make any sense? Not to me. It's
completely irrelevant if "pussy" originates from "pussycat" or refers to
girls who are seen by chauvinists as the weaker gender, because Dennis was
simply ticked off at someone who proved to be a chicken.
