Heal? So imagine a situation. Cleric throws complete heal on you, heals 
about 2500 hp. That pisses off the mob and it goes after cleric. Paladin 
casts GH (over 3 seconds casting time), and the mob goes back to 
paladin?
There's also a small problem with flash of light. If there's no players 
in the immediate melee range of the mob, it works like fear -- the mob 
bolts off. It's easy to avoid it, but figured I'd warn you
