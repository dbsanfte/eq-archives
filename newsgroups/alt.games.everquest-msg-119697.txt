It takes a load more to get to apprehensive, in fact a HUGE load more.
My dark elf cleric took a bit also, both due to innoruk probably as
well as being dark elves. You get to dubious right away as you said.
At least as a necro you can kill them WAY faster than my cleric. Once
apprehensive it probably took about as many again to get to amiable 
(so you can get the key from a guard) I assume you are talking about 
Paineel.

Orcs only raise the knights of truth (north freep guards) and monk
guild factions, as well as commons residents. Commons residents are
only about half the merchants in east and west commons. The rest of
the merchants in EC and WC and ALL the freeport zones, are on
coalition of tradesfolk. Few of the merchants in freeport are on
coalition of tradesfolk ill (illegal, cuts off in the client)

So you'll have to turn in more orc belts to the milita to raise them.
You don't NEED the militia above dubious though, unless you
specifically want it for giggles. To raise the merchants, coalition of
tradesfolk etc, do the jenam and rebby quests:

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/

quests for east freeport.

these are done in the sewer of east freep then running out into west
freep near the monk guild (but not so close that monks attack you) and
are great for dark elves.

Some old world ones are harder, but you still get there.  Buck up,
freeport as a whole and most other old world areas are WAY easier than
getting to apprehensive or amiable in Paineel.

>level, never to be increased, or made much harder to increase?  

Nope, if it raises it raises. My dark elf cleric of innoruk (of course
;) .. no other choice!  ) is in the same boat as your necro. She has
now raised all freeport factions to kindly or higher (sewer allied,
most of surface kindly or more, paladin guild max allied, vendors all
kindly, milita dubious) She even raised north freep cleric guild to
indiff finally, for convenient shopping. 

North freep cleric guidl was the hardest, she got paladin raised to
the point where she was amiable in the one use hobbit form mask
(cleric innoruk regent quest line) then used that form to hail altunic
in EC (wandering pally) by the inn where cloth shirts are sold from a
guy on commons residents faction (at that time from killing orcs she
was only still dubious with them, so needed halfling form to buy the
shirts too) This is the only place around to buy regular Cloth Shirt.
After buying a metric ton, she was max allied to the pally guild
forever and dubious to north freep clerics (clerics of MARR) finally,
via killing MORE orcs when bored, she got to apprehensive with commons
residents so she no longer needed to get the halfling mask to do this.
Then she got to indiff to north freep clerics fast. However, this got
her to barely threaten to freep militia so then she went to high hold
to fix it with quests there, yuck. Finally she got militia to high
dubious then repaired Marr clerics to indiff again. 

If I had done it right the first time it would have taken no where
near as long, but somewhere in there I got the bright idea that it
would be fun for  a cleric DEF of inny to have a paladin testimony of
truth... which got me to instant dubious with the militia (which is
why it dived doing later marr raising quests)

No, it only takes into account where you start. Dubious and
apprehensive are LARGE faction lengths. Faction lengths vary from mob
to mob. Its not YOU that is different, its the mob. Once you get to
velious, Giant or dragon faction dubious length is HUGE. You'll
remember the old world finally when it seems you were dubious for eons
(until you kill in Kael or kill some big dragons, then it goes up
fast)

Nope, you can raise any that raise.

Just think volume. Level of kobolds does not seem to matter, so
concentrate on all the lowbie ones around the entrance and having your
skel beat them down.
