Most of them, at least IME. The problem with a 'casual' group doing
the 65 Hard LDoNs is that you need the perfect group. You need a plate
tank, a cleric, someone who can reliably pull singles at a quick
pace(monk, bard, SK),  a slower (chanter or shaman)  and at least one,
preferably two, serious DPS classes.

Finding a tank that can take the hits isn't the problem, the problem
is that nobody but the tank can take a hit in those groups. 

Still, one of the nice things about lvl 70 is that those LDoNs will
get a lot easier for the casuals.
