Sad to say, but this has been a long time coming. Clearly they do not 
understand how to run a business. They have been on the steady decline 
since they ripped apart Dynamix and dropped all of those great 
franchises (I still lament the loss of Front Page Sports Football - 
games today are just STARTING to scratch the depth of that franchise 
from 10 YEARS ago).

Any word on what will happen with the upcoming LotR MMORPG?
