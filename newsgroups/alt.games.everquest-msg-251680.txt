Alright, swarming doesn't really change much from your first charm to
you last one at 64 as llyric explained it. The only major change is the
charm begines to cost mana, one of the few songs you get that do. This
of course limits the amount of time you can swarm, and then get ready
for an hour down time as we regen 3 mana a tick standing at level 65
and the 64 charm costs 90 mana... and no mana regen buffs or songs
affect us.

But, here's the low down on how I swarm at 65.
1) Find a place far from society, perferably static spawns, KoS or CoF
(call on friend) is required. The mobs must not be able to summon and
must also be level 54 or lower IIRC.
2) Fire up selo's Pull the whole camp (DO NOT cast on them or else they
will not attack your pet). The place I kite at has about 12 spawns that
hit for 355+ each, so be careful, don't get hit. If you do your dead.
3) Bring all the mobs to an area deviod of KoS and CoF mobs and target
one of the mobs.
4) Charm the targetted mobs and have it attack another mob, it may help
to have your pet sit so it's easier to target another mob.
5) Once your pet engaged one of the other mobs, circle around them a
few times for the others mobs often do not agro instantly, you'll have
to let them all take notice of the fight.
6) Your pet is going to go down FAST, depending on the mobs your
killing and the amount of mobs, I typically start casting invis (Selo's
song of travel pre-epic, invis song pro-epic. If you have to cast
travel, then you must redo your selo's after the charm breaks) to break
my charm at 50%. The charm will perferably break at 0-5%.
7) Charm another mob and have it attack another. Circle and let all fo
the mobs agro. The mob at 0-5% will continue to follow you. Now load on
the DoTs and get ready to break your charm again.
8) Rinse and repeat until all are dead. If you're unlucky, your last
pet will still be around 75% after it kills the last uncharmed mob, so
you'll have to DoT kite it to death.

You'll want high wind skill so you don't fizzle and burn all your mana.
And also a drum or epic equipped to keep you much fater then the mobs.

Whatever you do, do NOT do this in crowded areas. Swarming just plain
pisses people of, as it should. If they do anything, sit, agro a mob
near your swarm, buff you, help your pet, anything, they will get the
agro of the entire spawn and are almost garunteed death. This will not
make you a popular bard.
