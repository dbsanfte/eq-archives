My dog licks his own bollocks in public, and I do not. Hamsters eat their 
own young, and people generally do not. Male lions kill the cubs sired by 
other males when they take over a pride; humans do too, sometimes, but they 
generally are punished for it. Male dolphins are known to kidnap and gang-
rape females. Whether something is done by animals is not necessarily the 
litmus test of whether we ought to do the same or not.

I know that perfectly. If I had sufficient willpower and commitment, I 
would only eat that which I grow myself. Unfortunately, I do not; I just go 
as far as I can.

I've drawn the line where I feel comfortable with it. It's a totally 
artificial line, of course (I value a sequoia more than I do a cockroach, 
for example, even if it's a plant), but in general it works for me.
