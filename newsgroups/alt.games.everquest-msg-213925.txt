My entire life is full of thankless jobs. I honestly think I'd rather have
a thankless job than do nothing right now.

I think it's more of a "if it works it works, if it doesn't it
doesn't...and if I can't let a guild survive without turning it into
something I'm not happy with, then I'll let it die" thing for me.

I fully expect everything you say would be the case. *grin* I've just
gotten to this weird place in my life where I've been standing around
looking all respectful thinking "someone else can do this better than me.
Someone else knows more.  Someone else is worthy of following. Awww fuck,
no one is doing it right, I'll just pick up the flag and start myself
until someone better shows up."

Half of leadership is just being willing to be responsible when things go
wrong, I think.  The other half is actually trying to do something
intelligent.  I'm down with the first. The second...ehhhh...that's what
officers are for. :P
