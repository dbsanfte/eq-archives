The point isn't that, it's why on Earth would you consider the Dutch a 
"race"? Can you tell a Dutchman from a Frenchman, a Belgian, an 
Englishman or a German before they open their mouths?

I have a problem when people start equating "race" with "culture" and 
"religion"... Race doesn't even exist in any genetically or biologically 
meaningful way, and discrimination on the grounds of race is entirely 
idiotic. On the other hand, both religion and culture are of human 
origin, and as such they are subject to judgements of value. This 
doesn't mean that a person can or should be discriminated against 
because of culture or religion, but it doesn't make sense to call 
someone a "racist" when they say "I have a problem with this or that 
religion" or "I dislike this or that culture".

Hell, American culture is railed against all the time (with or without 
merit, that's not the issue) and nobody ever has been called a racist 
because of it.
