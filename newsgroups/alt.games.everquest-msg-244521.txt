Thinking about this...isn't it kind of odd?  Why would they put in code to
check your level against what expansions you own?  All I'd expect is a check
when you fill the XP bar to see if you should ding or not.  I suppose it
could be that level is not stored in the character database, just total XP,
and they calculate level when you log in.

But how about AA?  I'd expect the only check there to be whether or not you
can earn AAXP at all.
