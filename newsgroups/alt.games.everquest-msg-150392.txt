Like... every other class?  How about those bards, huh?  They sure clean 
out the place fast.  And how many of them area actually there for the 
exp and not the cash?  Hmmm...

I do *not* PP engaged mobs, thank you.  And hey, guess what, I started a 
necro because I was so goddamned sick of watching the soloers level 
while I begged for a group for hours wondering how many people were 
saying "don't invite them, they'll steal".

Gosh, thanks.  Remind me never to drag or summon your corpse out of a 
tight spot.  And while I'm at it, I'll apply that to every cleric and 
druid, because painting a class with one big fat brush is what it's all 
about.
