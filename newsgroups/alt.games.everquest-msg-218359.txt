Highkeep is a good example. why is it you cant go 30 minutes without seeing
all out WAR in ooc there.

Just fun to argue with people?

I had one guy in highkeep train my druid, when he started saying in ooc that
he did it on purpose i asked him why and he said he didnt like the way my
char looks. he said her hair was too short and so was she.so i /report the
screen and then /petition him. (taking the high road I guess.)  what is up
with the mentality level in highkeep though.


My theory on the matter is; highkeep is a 18-40 zone, and with the exception
of hte guard killers, I suspect most of the people in this zone never
progress much farther than that, highkeep seems to the permenant residence
of people who give up at 40 cuz it gets too hard, so they make a new char
that, in a day or two is right back in highkeep.
