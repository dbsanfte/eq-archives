One of the best PP places I have hunted is Hollowshade. The grimlings there
drop
2-5pp worth of loot most the time, drop lots of runes, and there are a lot
of them
around. They respawn quickly also. I know, most of them are FAR below 49th
level, but consider it harvesting! Or mowing the lawn. hehe Also, if you can
get
to hunt the 3 goblins near Kaladim, they drop 4 to 5pp worth of loot as well
as
armor that sells for a few pp. Again, lower than your level (I am hunting
them
at lvl 31) but decent pp for a little effort.
