Get you class armor "Raven scale".  Since it's "Rogue only", it's relatively
cheap (200pp a piece). You can also farm it in Cazic Thule.  Ry'Goor is
another option.   They both have similar stats except Ry'Goor leans a bit
more towards Str (good) and cost more since more classes can wear it (bad).

Get Jagged bands for rings (5ac ! and cheap 40pp ea..)  swap with resist
rings when required.

Get cougar claw earrings for ears (ac and STR)

At the higher levels, Rogues get Myrkolar armor from Kunark (Rogue Kunark
class armor 2000-2500pp a piece). I have a Myrkolar bracer that has the
effect of "summon dagger" which is my preferred range method.  I also have
Myrkolar arms which have the effect "earth strength".    Myrkolar is similar
to Velious Thurgadin quest armor in AC so you can go for that too.

Stats for a rogue,   AC and STR are the most important  stats,  all others
are less important (get them above 100 if possible especially dex. and
stm.).   Get resist gear for when you need them (fire, cold, magic...)

Good luck.
