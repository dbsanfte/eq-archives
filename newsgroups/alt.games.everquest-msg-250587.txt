I've searched some chanter web sites but cannot find a strategy on how to do 
it.  I've heard chanters are good at powerleveling other characters up and I 
know it involves mem blurring your target when it is low health and then let 
the low level character kill it.  What I need to know is where is a good place 
to do this and what strategy should I use to get the target mob to low health 
so that I can memblur it.  I have a 50 chanter and am leveling characters 
ranging from levels 12 thru 25.
