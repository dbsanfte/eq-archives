 Delete or backup your current UI files, then delete them from the EQ
folder. Run EQ and see if that fixes it. If so, quit EQ and back up
the new UI files cause if its anything like whats been happening with
me you'll need them. Memming a spell, crash and corrupted UI. Zoning
into revamped area, crash and corrupted UI. Trying to loot my
corpse... you know what happened.
