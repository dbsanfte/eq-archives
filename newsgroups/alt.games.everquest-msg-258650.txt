Back in my Marine Corps days I was running 9 to 12 miles a day in
boots and utility uniform. Climbed up and down aircraft lugging heavy
equipment. I weighed 200 lbs the whole time. Just because you run a
lot doesn't mean you are a stick figure if you have to lug a lot of
weight when you do it. In fact the people I knew that could lug the
equipment, for the most part, were stocky in build instead of sticks.
