Yes software driven modems sometimes called 'winmodems' can be
problematic when the system cpu is under heavy load.  The difference
between hardware modem and software modems is software modems uses the
system cpu to control the modem, which saves on modem production
costs.  Actually software modems are not technically modems since they
can not by themselves modulate or demodulate.

All ISA and external modems are hardware modems.
Almost all pci modems are software modems.

Its sad, but probably about 95% of the people out there have software
modems, but they are usually about half the price of a real modem.
