That was saccharin that was taken off the lists, and that was tested in 
that fashion.  To the best of my knowledge, Aspartame has not ever been put 
on the list, although there are many that claim it does cause health 
problems of various sorts, including brain cancer.  The studies that have 
been conducted have generally concluded that is not the case, but not all 
agree on that.
