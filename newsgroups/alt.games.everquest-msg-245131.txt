Honestly, where the hell did I mention rots?   And why do you assume they
would happen?     If nobody is speaking up for the item, much time has
passed and its even a marginal upgrade, say it.   "Not a big upgrade, don't
really care, but since nobody else seems to want it?     Anyone?"

Yeah.   I sort of assumed people wouldn't be that stupid, so I didn't need
to say it..   ( A big assumption around here, I know.)

Sorry, disagree.

The points are standard for that mob.   Its not like you could suddenly
announce "Today's Rumblecrush fight will be a 5 pointer!  Tomorrow we go
back to 1."

Thats just the way it happens sometimes.  Unless you think theres some
nefarious plot to control which boss spawns on which day.

Yep.   Since that raid was 5 times harder than yours, and has 1/5 the chance
of success.    And generally takes five times the time input.   If monday
raids were only 1 point, they were probably IV -> Vallon Zek -> Tallon
Zek -> HoH Trial B, each done in a half hour.    Where as the 5 point raid
was a two and a half hour Bertoxx event.  (Takes two hours of constant
killing, including 10 minibosses, before he even spawns.)

No.   Point values were well known, and not frequently changed.

As I said, most of the abuse can be eliminated by the way you design the
system.   Considering your post, I wouldn't want to play in a DKP system
that you would design.

Yeah.  Cause that changed every week too.   Are you really this stupid, or
are you just playing to the crowd?

What makes you think it was complex?   Unable to follow it?    The E'ci
public system was not complex at all.  Simple basic rules, with a few
exceptions.

> I favour... you show up and stay the duration... you get a point.

So you rate 15 minute killings of easy mobs with no time spent clearing
equal to a 4 hour raid with multiple wipes to kill a mob at the very edge of
the groups abilities?

Doesn't sound very fair to me.

Generally, the raiders who were present.  And if they're worth a damn, the
raid leaders.

And it doesn't benefit the raid group and it causes drama.

Oh please.  Don't get me wrong, I've seen some very shitty DKP systems get
announced.  Especially when some idiot starts mucking around with things
like bonus points for X and such.

But, a well designed DKP system will not have those problems.  (Almost by
the definition of "well designed")
