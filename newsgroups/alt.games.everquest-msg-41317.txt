When I see a bag laying on the ground I always pick it up and look.
(Incurrable curosity, I guess).  If it is not something someone might throw
away (rusty swords, etc), I try to find the owner.
Last time this happened, three people claimed it.  (Only one knew what was
in the bag and she got it back.)
