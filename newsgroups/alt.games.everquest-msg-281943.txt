I duo'd a bit of Fear with a 70+1100 Shammy friend a few weeks ago.  I
was 70+35, 9.3kHP 1600AC at the time.  We were there for the final
hand-in of my Paladin Epic 1.0.  It was cake.

News of the weird: I was chasing down a death-runner when Cazic Thule
popped right on top of me.  The big hairball didn't aggro and I got
away clean.  Go figure.

That being said...

Definitely setting yourself up for a WHTWWT moment.
