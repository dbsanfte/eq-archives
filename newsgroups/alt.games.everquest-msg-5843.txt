Gating mobs.
At higher levels you have either complete heal casters or gaters.
Complete heal takes 10 seconds, you can nuke something to death in
that time.  Gate takes 5 seconds, the biggest nukes take 6 to 7
seconds to cast.

Wish to hell it was possible to stun dragons...gating dragons in
Western Wastes is a Very Bad Thing (TM).
