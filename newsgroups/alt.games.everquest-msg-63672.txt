Many melee get caught up in the damage per shot trap... damage per
shot isn't all that important, what matters is damage per minute.  You
should be dual weild, dual attack, hitting for three or four times per
round, and that "per round" with 18 delay weapons is pretty short.
You should be dishing out an average of 100 blows per minute,
and what, an average around 20 points per, or 2000 points... which
is plenty to kill your average level 30 mob.  Get a haste spell slapped on

you and that per minute rate goes up even higher, a haste item to wear
pops it up still higher.

Further, it isn't your job to kill a mob by yourself, as you level up,
mobs
are balanced for groups not for solo combat, their HP tends to climb
faster than your damage output so that two or three melees are in order
to take them down smoothly, and then so that those melees start to
require nuke support to take down larger mobs in any sort of realistic
time.  If you are putting in 1/4th the damage required to drop a mob
in a six man group (assuming healer and mezer are doing no damage)
then you are pulling your weight...and as a monk, you'll probably be
doing closer to a third or half the damage, your per minute output
can be really astonishing compared to warrior/SK/paladin tanks.

In addition, your principle job isn't damage, as good as you are at it,
its pulling; the monk, with its no mana FD capability, is the premier
puller class in Norrath, able to drag in just one mob where anyone
else would likely bring three or four, and able to drag a body out from
under almost any sort of serious trouble.  Distracting the mobs from
the magic, on the other hand, is something you are fairly poor at, with
no taunt and no spell capability, all you have is a high hits per minute
count to annoy them with.  Bring in the singles, help chop them up,
try not to suck up much of the healer's mana, wash, rinse, repeat.
