*.ini

*.opt

Those two are most important, above, the ini
file of all your settings and the char buttons/etc 
settings.


*.xml (the luclin patcher settings)

*.txt (includes datarate.txt and any logs?)

*.doc (for the heck of it)

*.log (or are logs just *.txt? forget)

Or you could just burn the entire dir onto like 3 cdroms if you have a
burner, I did that ;) Only thing I did was first delete *.txc (texture
cache files) Then you have those cdroms to quickly copy into a dir
after reformating, WAY faster than installing from scratch. You copy
them all into a new dir (name or location does not matter) then
highlight all of them and turn off "read only"(happens since they were
on a cdrom), and go into the folders in the dir and do the same thing.
EQ has basically no registry info, or its not needed anyway.
