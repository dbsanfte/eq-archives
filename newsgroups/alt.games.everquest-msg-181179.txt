It isn't Large that matters, tho the higher base STA of the large
races definitely helps.  It's being an Ogre SK and thus immune
to melee stun from the front, or (not as good) being an Iksar SK
and getting a bit of extra AC (harder to get good armor because
a lot of plate can't be worn by Iksar).

Bard (and Cleric) are "plate class" only in an eye-candy sort of
way, they do not get the same damage mitigation the "real" tanks
do.  I don't know which of Ranger and Monk is most often a better
tank than the other (gear, gear, gear said the tanker), but I'd
definitely put them both well ahead of the rest of these.

No idea what order the dress wearers should be in (well, except for
those pink dress clad Monks), does it actually matter?
