/agree  I love my barb rogue, high str, i didn't pump points to stamina
but am over 100 with being a barbarian.  Pumped my points into dex and
agility, since those were the verant suggested stats to pump.  I think
most of my stats except wisdom and charisma are well over 100, most over
125.  

If you want to do trade skills as a barbarian rogue it will check
against your wisdom, go get a testament of vaneer, easy no drop 10
wisdom item.  Get some jasper rings and bank them and the testament,
when you want to tradeskill pull them out.
