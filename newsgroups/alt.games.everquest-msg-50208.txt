Wow, that's some twink!  INT/CHA of 160/150...nice!  I'd take off some CHA
and replace it with INT though...but you've got a really nice level 31.

I can't really advise you on equipment...I know almost nothing about it.
For me, if I happen to run across a piece of equipment that's better than
what I have, it's always a pleasant surprise. <g>  The only exceptions that
I can think of are the Thurg armor quests, GEBs and (at the time) the cool
looking robe from CC (I just HAD to have that...it goes so well with my
green hair <g> ).  I upgraded it to a Siren's Scale Robe that I stumbled on
in Howling Stones...cool. :)  Nice robe, no CHA though.
