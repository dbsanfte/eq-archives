I think the shift was a long time in the making, but yes there has
been a big shift in the last few years.  If you look at Canadian news
sites you will see the US in the headlines a lot, but rarely in a
positive light.  I largely blame it on Bush as well, although some of
it is circumstances: our national positions on many world issues are
at odds, and there have been a few events which people are reluctant
to forgive.
