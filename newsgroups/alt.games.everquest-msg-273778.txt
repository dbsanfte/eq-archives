I don't really follow WoW much (they lost me at the "no, you can't
play on the US servers, come back once we release in Europe"), but as
I understand it they've hired a bunch of former Everquest uber guild
players to do game design for raids.  E.g. Furor from Fires of Heaven.
It'll be interesting to see if he'll manage to actually do better than
the SOE designers he's been whining about for so long...
