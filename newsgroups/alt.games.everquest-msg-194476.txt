I have a relatively small screen, and cluttering it up with an open bag instead of
just a hotkey panel (which -has- to be open) doesnt seem like a very good idea.

Primary Slot  Secondary Slot
Inventory 1   Inventory 2
Inventory 3   DS bracer
Tracking       Assist
Forage           Detect Traps

The last two slots are on automatic hotkey, which I probably need to go kill; I used
it to max out sense heading and various other skills on my various characters, but
don't need that anymore.

Sword  Mace
Flute   Drum
Empty

Lute Mace
Flute Drum
Empty

Empty Drum
Sword Mace
Flute

Empty Flute
Sword Mace
Drum

Lute hangs out in yet another open inventory slot, but I'd love it to be in a
hotkeyed one... and put my TBoots in yet another
