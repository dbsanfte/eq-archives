This was not an apples and oranges question Matt. By killing giants and 
getting my faction up with the Coldain I assume that the faction with 
Wuoshi has also gone up. What I was trying to say then, was, could I use 
the Coldain faction as an indicator of Wuoshi faction. Sorry that I could 
not draw a picture for you.
