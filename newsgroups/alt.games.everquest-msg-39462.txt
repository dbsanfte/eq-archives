    Then make any item with any prestige whatsoever No Drop. Then you at
least had to get to the zone in which the item is dropped, instead of
sitting on your ass in EC. I can think of only ONE item with prestige
attached that is droppable, and that's the biggest mistake in the game in
terms of when an item should be dropped and when it should be quested.

    OK, let me get this straight. You think it's a good thing that it
requires folks to muster friends and guildmates to go get an item for a
single person? Bah, you must design quests for VI. One of the hardest things
to do in game is convince several players that their on-line time is best
spent in an activity that will benefit ONLY someone other than themselves in
a direct manner, and could in fact hurt them. Ask clerics that got their
Sprinklers early on how their guild felt about Chardok.

    As for this "it would be on a two hour timer" idea: rubbish. The way VI
figures time is that every [expectation value of time for the rarest spawn],
the item WILL come into being in the world. So saying they'd put something
they wanted to be valuable on a two hour spawn is ludicrous. To them, that
would be like saying they wanted 12 of these items to hit the server every
day. And that isn't very rare or prestigious.

    That is the most ass-backwards thinking I've ever seen on the subject,
even taking into account what you've written above as supporting your
contention. TCC will CAUSE people who would otherwise not camp items to camp
them if they wish to posess them, because there will be fewer farmers to
farm them and sell them in EC.

>Maybe you think everyone new buying the game
>should be forced to suffer like you did. I don't.

    Maybe I don't want them to suffer like others did, but they seem
hell-bent on doing it to themselves.
