For some reason I missed the initial post, but here are some things that
helped get me to 14, Orc camp in Misty, 2 spawns easily split.  Don't
overlook porcupine techniques.  at 11/12, it only lasts just short of
the duration of the fight, but for one bubble of mana, it does
unresistable 6 points of damage per hits times 10 hits or so and which
comes out to 60 points of damage per opponent hitting you, Don't
overlook tree-form, unless you are fighting casters who use fire based
spells, it allows you to regen HP faster and reduces agro, it does root
you, but that a minor consequence.  Use skin like wood, thistlecoat,
strength buff, and firefist, self buff with sheild of thistles,
immediately hit your target with flamelick, start swinging.  get snare
on before they run and level away.
