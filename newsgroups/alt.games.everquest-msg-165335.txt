That doesn't match what I've seen.  I was duoing vs undead with my guild's
sole monk, who was two levels below me.  I had better gear, by far.  He not
only out-damaged me, but he outtanked me.  My paladin was pretty much down
to being a spare tank/cleric.  This is against something we're supposed to
be good at fighting.  Granted, all that does is prove that a monk is
seriously more powerful than a paladin, which isn't suprising, and orc pawn
is seriously more powerful than a paladin.

You uberguilds have ruined your own lands, you'll not ruin ours.
