1. The level 60 game is not the same as level 50 game.

2. You have not acquired 200 levels over 2 years so dont even add it that 
way. What you have done is made a char leveled to 50 and realised you 
wanted to try another char. 

3. Being a powergamer is not being an idiot. We are in most cases the 
best marketing tools Verant has. Not just to people not playing EQ but to 
people also playing EQ. When low levels clicked on my war and asked me a 
zillion questions. I sat down (if I had the time) and told our adventures 
in velious / luclin / kunark. I have seen a great number of low level 
warriors  
get the motivation to keep on leveling and enjoy the game after I told 
them of the riches ahead. 

Yes this game is about adventure and loot. Most high levels show that in 
thier equipment.

People have fun at different levels but for me high level raiding is 
where it the game becomes fun for me. If you think I am an idiot go 
ahead. Atleast I have pushed the limits of my class. That cannot be said 
for you.
