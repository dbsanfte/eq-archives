}Huh. I didn't know you could divorce your in-laws...

Heh, you know what I meant... :)  Usually, divorce leads to a big bad 
faction hit with the Wife'sFamily faction, but I seem to have been high 
enough not to become KoS.

}(but what does your wife think?)

Well, she left me.  Makes it pretty clear what she thought, really. :)

(Note to any weird anti-EQ people planning to spam the group:  No, she 
left -before- I started playing EQ, not -because of- EQ...)
