Gawd I'm having fun with this guy...  

	Now I ve got Tiger Claw...(at least I think that's what it
is)..
when I use it is also greys out my round kick... so they are on the
same timer... which triggered a question in my head (don't ask me how
I got to the question from there but?)
I have, Kick, Round Kick, and Tiger Claw...  Should I just forget
about the Kick? and just work up round kick and tiger claw?

how exactly does the damage delay run.. is the tiger claw a faster
refresh then the round kick?

any advice on these melee skills would be greatly appreciated.
