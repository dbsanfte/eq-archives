Well, the other problem with this hypothetical is it's using
historical hindsight.  We know Salk DID convey the cure for polio.
But he could very well have decided to save himself, stepped out onto
the street to grab a lungfull of smokeless air and gotten run over by
a truck.  Point being simply you don't know what the future holds in
store.

Well, that's certainly the most commonly held view, but I wonder how
true it is?  Note that I didn't say that all insane people are evil.
There are some forms of insanity where the person could unknowingly
commit an evil act and not be held responsible; you're quite right
about that.

But I think I'm pretty much convinced that the further you go in the
driection of acts of raw evil, the more you become insane, in a
perfectly technical sense.  You become a psychopath.  Hitler was
certainly insane.  I believe Stalin was a psychopath and Saddam
Hussein is one.  Other people cease to have much reality for these
types, there is only the great Self to be nurtured.  As someone else
mentioned, you come to the point where the suffering of others becomes
enjoyable -- this is surely insanity.  Just my opinion, of course, but
I've convinced me :)

If I'm right, do we excuse Hitler and Stalin because they were insane
and "didn't know what they were doing?"  Tough one, but to me the
answer is clearly no.

It is possible to commit small acts of evil without being insane, but
in my opinion it isn't very good for you and you should avoid it :)
