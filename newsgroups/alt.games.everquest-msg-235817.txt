You will never be able to visit all the "old world" (the ones on Norrath,
not on Luclin or PoK) as any race,
Dark elfs are kos to all citys except there home, it doesnt really matter
these days as you can get most things in shadowhaven were you will be
welcome
or the bazaar, or make a mule and use the shard bank slot to get stuff from
other citys.
Faction is based on alot of things
Race
Diety
Things you have killed (kill an elf you lose faction with elfs, kill an
enemy of the elfs like a gnoll or orc and you gain faction, you will see
these messages upon killing things.)
Class

for you
Cleric = "good" class
Dark elf = Evil
Dietys DE clerics can pick = Evil
so you gonna start out Kill on sight (KoS) too all races not dark elf
if you really want to play a cleric pick any race but Dark elf and you will
be ok in most old world towns. (any town other then Cabalis, Oggok and
neriak)
if you really want to play a dark elf then make a rogue, you can sneak/hide
around to look at most towns, but u wont be able to use merchants or
anything
if you want a dark elf cleric then you wont be seeing much of other towns
unless you spend literally hundreds of hours doing nothing but faction
related quests and even then u will stilll have to watch out.
