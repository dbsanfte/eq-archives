iirc:

1. Get cleric to get aggro.

2. Cleric got summoned.

3. Cleric jumped off bridge.

4. Due to pathing problems, warder could not run and stomp on cleric.
   Also, summoning broken when cleric in this position. (Or you had to
   wait 15 seconds for another summon to be allowed, anyway).

5. Warder sits there like an idiot not attacking anyone.  (It is trying
   to move to bash the cleric, but cannot).

6. Eventually, MT gets aggro to get attacked again, go back to (1)

The guild concerned tried the line of, "Yes, it's an exploit, but everyone
does that" when talking to Verant, but that's no defense.

Tris.
