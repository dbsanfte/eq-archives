  Okay, I think smarter NPCs is good thing.  However, these changes went a
BIT too far, at least with regards to some NPCs.

  Anybody tried hunting elder/ancient shardwurms in GD recently?  On top of
having a ton of health and hitting pretty hard for their level (with a cold
150 point DD proc), ancient shardwurms now cast Judgement, a level 56 cleric
DD that does 925 points of damage when not resisted.  Ancient shardwurms con
light to solid blue to me at 51, putting them around level 35-38.  Does this
strike anyone else as being rather absurd?  To make matters worse, these
things move VERY slowly and they chain cast, a combination that makes them
almost impossible to pull.  If you want to fight these things it's almost
essential to rush their spawn point (which means you'll probably get at
least a couple adds.)  I tried to help my friends get some spells and wurm
bile today, and with my level 51 shadow knight, I found the ancient wurms
all but impossible to pull.  Even with 105 MR and being several levels above
them with Resolution and a Symbol, I couldn't pull these things back to my
group without needing healing (and by the time I get to my group for
healing, I am outside the mob's 'lazy range' and it returns to its spawn
point).  They were hitting me for 250-800 points a pop with their nukes.  It
didn't help that the thing would cast around corners... it would even BEGIN
casting at me from around corners.  I had a wurm completely out of my sight,
and it proceeded to nuke me 5 times in a row.

  Caster NPCs already have a lot of advantages over PC spellcasters that
make up for their less than perfect AI.  They can cast around corners and
disregard range, they channel better than we do and have larger mana pools,
and typically have as much HP or more than a decently equipped,
cleric-buffed PC warrior.  In addition they have a lot less difficulty
landing spells than we do, as I very much doubt a level 35ish cleric could
do almost full damage with their nuke on a level 51 NPC with slightly above
average MR.  For them to have spells ABOVE their current level takes it a
step WAY too far.  Caster NPCs shouldn't even have all of their spells up to
their current level, because I know not all PC casters do... I think for
each dropped or research-only spell, there should be some random formula for
determining whether or not the creature knows the spell... like (NPC Level -
Spell Level + 1) * 15, to determine a value that would be a percentage
chance of the NPC knowing the spell, so a level 50 wizard NPC would spawn
with a 30% chance of knowing Ice Comet, a level 49 research/rarely
dropped/quest only spell, while a level 56 wizard would definitely spawn
with this spell at its disposal.  I don't know if the underlying mechanics
behind NPC spawning permits this, but it would be a fair (in my opinion) way
of doing it if it is possible.

  Verant says they made these changes to be "consistent" (because they were
afraid to use the term "realistic".)  My question is, consistent with WHAT?

  I'm sure that Verant will be adjusting some of these NPCs, because they
have said as much, and when you have some NPCs as out of whack as they are,
it's pretty much necessary.  But I do somewhat question the wisdom of the
principle behind the change.  Places like the Temple of Droga and Kedge Keep
already went underutilized. These changes are only going to make these
caster-heavy dungeons even more intimidating to people and they will be used
even less.  The loot in some of these places (let's stick with Droga and
Kedge as an example) isn't even that great for the level, and the zone
experience modifier, while nice, does not come close to making these places
worthwhile from an exp grinder's viewpoint.... not with the recent changes,
anyhow.  Unless they're going to start putting huge (45%-70%) experience
modifiers on some of these caster heavy zones, I can't see how they can be
possibly considered balanced from a risk vs. reward standpoint.

  These are my initial impressions, anyway.  We'll see what happens as time
goes on and these creatures are readjusted.
