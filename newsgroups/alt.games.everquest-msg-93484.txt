I did not play EQ over the weekend.  My mage character was camped in Sanctus
Seru where he was indifferent to dubious (some named Questioners and Arx
factions).  I had been able to wander the city freely to bank and do
Lightcrawler armor quests.  I had been hunting only factionless MOBs
(lightcrawlers, zelniaks, shrooms, wolves).

Last night while going to the bank, I was accosted by a Defender of Arx and
promptly died (didn't think I'd need my pet in the city).  I know that I was
previously dubious to some of the Arx NPCs but I'm sure I did nothing to
lower that faction.  I saw several other corpses in the area and talked with
two other players who were attacked and were not previously KOS in the city.
Any one know what happened?
