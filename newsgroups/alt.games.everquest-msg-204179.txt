The first thing I would do is get your group of friends and do Hand / 
Warlord in KC and get a Supple Scale Armband ( Warlord drop ).  "Warm up" 
to get your skills derusted in an easy camp like Captain or RCY if you need 
to, then work your way to Hand and get your armband.  If your friends do 
Fear, Kael, etc, then you shouldn't have to warm up with the power and 
skill your friends will bring to the fold.

When I brought my 'chanter out of retirement after 6-7 months of not 
playing EQ, it took me 2-3 groupings to get back into it and I was back to 
where I was before.
