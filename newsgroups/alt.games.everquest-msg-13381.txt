From what I understand Verant feels that this guild used constant CH to keep
aggro of melee and, stuck clerics under the bridge and used CotH to pull
aggro off of them.  In effect this appears to be a bug in the game where the
MOB may in fact be aggro to no one.  This line by GM Valdemar says it all:

>[Tue Jun 05 01:40:22 2001] Valdelmar says, 'I saw that you had the clerics
under the bridge doing    constant ch's gaining the agro. Mages then coth to
remove it while your melee beat away with no problems.'


Also here is VI contact email if you want to voice an opinion:

Tue Jun 05 01:28:00 2001] Valdelmar says, 'Any concerns you have in this
matter can be addressed to mbutler@station.sony.com'


In my opinion, Verant needs to do something to address this issue, and I
don't think banning players is the answer.  Yes, I guess you can say the
players exploited a flaw in the programming, but I think Verant needs to be
willing to expect this.  It is human nature to want to beat a game, or find
a flaw in it.  To me it seems as though VI expects players to play test the
game, and like a good employee, report any problems.  Only problem with this
is that the player is not a paid employee but rather a paying customer.
Right now they can continue to get away with it, but I don't think this type
of thing will continue fly for future games when the market broadens.
People may rant and rave, but due to a lack of options, few people will
actually quit EQ.  In the future there may be a choice of 10 similar online
games, and players really will say "screw you, I have a choice", but until
then I am sure people can all expect to see more of the same.
