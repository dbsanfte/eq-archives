I don't understand why this seems to happen a lot.  Over the past
three years, I have read and heard stories about Guild Leaders not
playing for a few months and then they come back and disband the
guild.

Why does this happen?  The stories I've heard are nearly identical to
each other.

If I was a guild founder and I was gone for months and I came back to
find the guild is healthy I would not disband it.  Heck, I wouldn't
disband it if it was in complete disarray.

It's almost as if former guild leaders have some kind of power trip
when they do this.
