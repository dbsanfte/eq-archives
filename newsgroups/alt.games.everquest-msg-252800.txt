A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the

>Are there armor quests beyond newbie quests for higher level players?

Yeah. The armor tiers go approximately like this:

Newbie quested armor (or just plain banded)
Sol Ro level quested armor (crafted, darkforge, etc)
Twilight Sea quested armor (almost universally ignored)
Old EQ planar dropped armor (indicolite, etc)
Kunark dropped armor (cobalt, etc)
Thurgadin quested armor (quest drops in Kael)
Kael/Skyshrine quested armor (quest drops in ToV)
Cultural tradeskilled armor
Ornate quested armor
Elemental tradeskilled armor
LDoN pointbought armor
Elemental quested armor

and so on into the GoD armors.

Of course there's many individual pieces of armor you get in between
those levels from drops. But I covered most the normal sets.
