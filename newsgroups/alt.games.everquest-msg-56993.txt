The MOTD on Tunare and the official statements about these events seem
to imply to me that things aren't going to go back to "business as
usual" in Norrath after these events have ended. I'm not saying I
think the zones will still be infested, but I think they are going to
be impacted. Maybe some of the mobs will hang around, just not as
dense? I don't know...

All I know is that EK has been heaven. Got 4 stacks of silk swatches
in a day's hunting there... The spiders are plentiful, so silk
collecting is easier than usual.
