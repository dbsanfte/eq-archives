Rallos Zek gem is Jade I think and regular imbued Ogre War plate isn't
worth the money. The few pieces I experimented with I ended up giving
away because people simply wouldn't cover costs. 

Also bear in mind Ogre war plate takes 70+pp PER block of ore (up to 3
blocks per item) which is damn heavy, unstackable and has to be carried:
Neriak 3rd Gate (good luck being non-KOS there as a non-agnostic Ogre)
Neriak Commons
Neriak Foreign Quarter
Nektulos Forest
East Commons
North Ro
Oasis
South Ro
Innothule Swamp
Feerott
Oggok
Which is the most zone-crossing trip in Old Norrath - And warriors and
Sks (2/3s of Ogre Classes) can't gate

PLUS temper (brewing: 3 different kinds of rare drop blood + 1 vendor
bought item) PLUS leather backing (Tailoring: more green farming for
materials)

Then you have to combine them using a skill which at 191 skill is taking
50-100 attempts per increase and risk losing everything. Even on success
the items aren't usually worth the 500pp+ it should sell for. I'm happy
to combine materials people provide (the in group combine message helps
here) but won't make any more to sell because the 'hassle factor' simply
isn't worth it, and the financial gain is negligible when I can solo HGs
for 30pp a time losing less than a half bub of hps
