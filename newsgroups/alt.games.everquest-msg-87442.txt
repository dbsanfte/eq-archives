Keep in mind that they've said Eye is not meant to be a scouting tool,
so unless they say they've changed their mind, I'm assuming that they
are busy looking for some way to make it useless again for scouting.

What's really annoying is they won't tell us what it *is* supposed to
be for.

The bind sight nerf was extra annoying because they wouldn't even
acknowledge for a long time that there was a change.
