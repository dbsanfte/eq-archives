Well - i can tell you that Im a software developer (not fun stuff -
but dull database business crap), and testing in the development and
beta environment is a whole different world than an actual release to
the masses. You can do all the testing you want to in a controlled
environment, but when its unleashed, anything can happen. Just kinda
sick and tired of people bashin people when they dont have a clue to
the process.
