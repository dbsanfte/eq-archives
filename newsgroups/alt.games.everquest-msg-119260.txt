I just upgraded my graphics and sound cards and im havin a few problems
maybe someone here can help.

1. Upgrade from Geforce2 MX400 to Geforce4Ti 4400 has gone very smooth. No
problems so far except that my digital vibrance slider under the color
correction tab in my display settings is gone. I have tried several drivers
to no avail and I really miss this feature(Everything is way faster but
duller looking on the GF4). Does anyone know how to fix this? Does the GF4
have this feature? It makes sense that it would sense both the GF2 & 3 have
it.

 Video Card is a Leadtek WinFast A250 if that helps.

2. Upgrade from SBLive! to Turtlebeach Santa Cruz has not gone as smoothly.
I managed to uninstall the SBLive!'s drivers but I cannot find a way to
remove the software suite that came with it(Creative launcher, playcenter
etc.) aside from strait up deleting the files which I know is bad and I dont
want to FUBAR my new system. Sound outside of EQ is fine but in EQ the sound
levels are all messed up and the sound pops and cracks when im casting
spells and the wind is deafening. The SBLive! never popped and cracked ever
and the audio levels although not perfect were better in EQ. I read many
reviews of this card and they all said that it never popped or cracked or
hissed and sounded better than the SBLive!
For music listening id have to agree so I want to keep the Santa Cruz has
anyone ever encountered this problem and knows how to fix it?

Sound Card is Turtle Beach Santa Cruz.

System specs are

Dell Dimension 8200
1.7Ghz
512MB RDRAM
60GB HD
Sound and video cards mentioned above

Any help would be greatly appreciated as I really dont want to have to go
back to the SBLive! As the Santa Cruz is superior when it works correctly.
