i like the idea of an underwater race.  maybe they could look like in
Majora's Mask when Link puts on the zora mask???  it would be nice to have
one of these in a group with you because they would be a big help fighting
the underwater mobs.  the only problem is that they would have to cover
their gills with something if they wanted to come up out of the water, so
maybe they could have some kind of item to put in the neck slot.

also, fairies would be really cool.  maybe if they were really small like
willow wisps and their city was in a tree somewhere.  they could provide
light for a group because they would shine like Tinkerbelle.  fairies would
have to be all casting classes though because a little shiny dot does not
really make a very good tank...
