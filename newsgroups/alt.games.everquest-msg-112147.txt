Something like the last 10 rage pops in a row, have involved some drama or
another and gm intervention...

Luckily we haven't needed Rage for many of our clerics (my cleric needs it
tho..)..

A guildie cleric camped it a while back, and it finally popped as we were
outside Zlandikars room.  Randomguild_01 obviously thought we wouldn't be
able to protect the camp seens as we were in DN, so they and their allies
(guild x) started to form up..

Within 5 mins Zland was dead and looted, and Rage was pulled (by us) amidst
various shouts and threats by the other guilds leader :)   (They proceeded
to train 5 dragons over us during our Sontalak c.r at a later date)

A friend who I helped with most her epic, had camped in Skyfire for
something crazy like her third week (she was leader of a tiny guild)  she
had been FCFS'd by guild x already (guild x have bought every freakin rage
pop to the server messageboards for the last 2 months also)

In this time she was camping it with guild z.. and for some stupid reason
had agreed to let the guild z cleric get the first rage pop...  Anyway Rage
popped, she /told me.. the guild z cleric wasnt online.

Guild x were on the way.. I wasn't prepared to wait for the guild z cleric
to log back on, and have guild x take it (and my friend lose out yet again)

I asked my guild leader (he didnt know who the cleric in question was),
within like 10 seconds, a massive ks group (2 60monks, a 60 rogue, 2 60
wizards, a cleric) were in skyfire wizard spot... by the time we ran to the
druid portal, there were 40+ guildies in the zone, and rage was inc.

The whole zone going nutso about who's rage it was....  random people were
zoning in and hitting it, then "congrating" various clerics heh..

And one other time :).. a guildie had been camping it, when it popped (like
5am est) he told all the guild (very few online), and asked everybody on his
friends list.. one of them, a cleric (in an Aussie guild) said "yeah i'll
help".. then turned up with his guild to FCFS it lol.   7 people total, a
monk tanking, but we got it deaded nevertheless

(That cleric in question later FCFS'd another of our clerics while we were
engaged in ntov heh)

SF Rage sucks ass.. pure and simple :/
