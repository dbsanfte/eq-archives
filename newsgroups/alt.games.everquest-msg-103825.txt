 Agreed, Nathyn is definitely easier than Itraer. Going by your list of
mobs I'd put him third from the bottom. Doomshade is also easier than
Rumblecrush. I'd put Grieg above DaVyn as well. I'm not sure I'd put IV
at the top though. He's fairly easy once you get your tactics down. Then
again I haven't been around when we did BB so I don't know how tough
that is.
