I find my summoner to be more effective against groups, root works wonders.  
I have all app 1 spells, and am level 11 right now, and I can take on 
groups of heroic mobs that I could not do with either my brawler or my 
shaman at the level.  For taking on single mobs, whether heroic or not, I 
find the summoner not as effective.
