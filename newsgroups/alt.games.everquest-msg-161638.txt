Well, even my L54 "lowbie" Paladin averages better than 20 dps with
only 46% haste (SBoC + self-buff).  And I can chain stun without
losing very much of that (admittedly weak) damage output, as hybrids
don't have their melee timer(s) reset by a successful cast like real
casters do.  But that's okay, you go ahead and tank/kill the mobs.
I'll just hang back here sippin' and grinnin' with the Necros and
throw a couple stuns at the caster adds until the Chanter get's 'em
mezzed, maybe once in a great while tank for Jabober when the RNG
decrees that the Monkee shall be obliterated faster than the Cleric
can heal him, since I'm so useless otherwise.  :-p
