They never mentioned a cap for building skills, but since the mana cap
on wis is now like 255 its about as high as you'd  reasonably get
anyway.

for trade skills like smithing your wis would help to gain skill as as
well as your str (there is always a 5 percent chance of failure on
items and no stat helps success, only your skill in the tradeskill
decides success)
