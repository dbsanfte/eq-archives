A vote for anyone except Kerry is a vote for Bush, which is why the 
republicans are doing everything they can to help get Nader on ballots, 
and why democrats are doing everything -they- can to keep him off ballots.

Which I find repugnant, both sides.

Heck, since the same supreme court is in office, and the same guys are 
still in charge in Florida, even a vote for Kerry might end up counting 
as a vote for Bush.

As bad as Bush is, though, my fondest hope in a Kerry victory (slim 
though the chance of that is) would be that Ashcroft would also be 
replaced.  Rereading The Day After Tomorrow (and thinking I've got to 
find a copy of Sixth Column cause I like that title better) and 1984 
before someone bans them for releasing state secrets.
