Since you put your prediction on the line, here's mine:
There won't be a change of administration (barring an
unexpected heart attack or internal coup), but North
Korea won't get a dime more international aid (at least
from the US) than it got before.

In short this is based on a) Bush is not Clinton (or
even his father), and b) North Korea is too hard up,
economically, to play this bluff very long or be
hard-nosed about it.  They'll be glad to go back to their
old deal once they see that they can't wave the "nuke card"
and bargain for anything extra, although we might throw
them a face-saving change to the deal that looks like
a concession but doesn't truly amount to one.
