Depending on what the guilds doing, or specific members online, people from
the top few guilds will be LFG for these trials too.

Sure 99% may be dweebs, but every now and then you will find pick someebody
up who makes a massive difference.

Of course when I got invited into a pickup group, it was the most stupid
retarded druid I think I've ever met (and the first person to be kicked from
a group im in since i was level 25)

DFD (Dumb Fuck Druid) tells the group, "Whats VoG?"
DFD tells the group, "And haste does what exactly?"
DFD tells the group, "Shamans can cast VoG?"
DFD tells the group, "Can shamans cast clarity then?"
DFD tells the group, "Can shamans cast haste at all?"
DFD tells the group, "Can i see your robe in trade?"
DFD tells the group, "Can i see your cloak in trade?"
DFD tells the group, "Can i see your weapons in trade?"
DFD tells the group, "Can i see that mask in trade?"
DFD tells the group, "So what are shamans good for other than nuking?"
DFD tells the group, "They can slow?  Oh.. so what use is that?"
DFD tells the group, "Whats focus?"

He made the group with no cleric...  so we went in to our death in a
trial... of course we died.

DFD tells the group, "God we almost had that!"   (no.... we didnt even get
past wave 1)
DFD tells the group, "Next time I will heal, that will make the difference"
(Hi, you were our only fucking healer the first time!)

The sad thing is he was 61, im quite relieved we failed too... people like
that are a death trap in PoV
