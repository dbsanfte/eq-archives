  Although if you *have* played their class to a similar level and/or 
beyond, it's kind of a good idea to start giving them guidance if you see 
them screwing up really, really badly. Case in point: The druid I grouped
with at Orc 1 in East Commonlands on the Nameless last night. 
  This was a guy who refused to heal, kept jumping in to melee (in a 
group with a necromancer and at least one warrior), and burned all his 
mana on nuking. An excerpt from just after a fight:

  "Come on, heal!"

  "I'm OOM!"  (This immediately after casting tree form.) "Just sit and    
   heal up...I'm going to use all my mana for nuking."
 
 Then there was the conversation about harmony, which would have been a 
very useful tool for pulling at an orc camp:

   "Okay, so harmonize those two orcs..."

   "Druids don't get harmony."

   "Um, yes they do. Trust me."

   "No, they don't. Bards get it."

   "Look, I've got a druid with harmony sitting in his spellbook as big        
   as life. I know what I'm talking about, okay?"

  He proceeded to ignore me. Finally, after nagging our warrior (who was 
down to two bubbles of health because this guy refused to heal) to pull a 
fully-popped orc camp, he pulled the entire thing without telling us with 
a nuke...while in *tree form*. 
  I discovered that it's remarkably easy to target yourself and hit 
"DISBAND" while you're running like hell for the tunnel.
