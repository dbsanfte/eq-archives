Yeh, but I'd like to achieve in-character things, rather than achieve 
the skill to handle an ugly interface.

The skill of 'clicking on mobs over and over until you get the one at 
100% health before casting root' doesn't give me any sense of 
achievement.  The skill of 'being able to target a mob, root it, move 
away, target another, root that, move to the other target, snare it 
....' etc. does, but that joy is stomped on because it's very hard to be 
100% sure which mob you've got targeted because of the interface.  And 
it's an abstract out-of-game problem.
