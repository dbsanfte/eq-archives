Same as I...at level 53 I seem to often win the spot of "pivot-man" in a
circle-jerk of baddies.  Had a group in KC the other day that couldn't seem
to get them off me.  Good thing we had a decent healer.  Finally pulled out
the Symphonic Saber and that did the trick since it was proccing like a
madman.  Put it away and they were again working to repeat the colon fisting
they were giving me earlier.  Same thing happened in Velks last night.  We
had a War, 2  pallies, ranger, me (bard) and cleric.
As far as "holding aggro" through a complete fight, I don't know about that,
but I seem to be able to piss most things off by just barding about the
place.

Sean...
