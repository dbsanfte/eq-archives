I know some people on my server, but we are not the chatty type and they
spend most of their time in the zones where when you are busy you are busy.
So regardless of the fact that I do know them, when I send them a message
out of the blue it reads something like this.
"Hi would like to talk to you when you have a sec, if you are to busy to
respond right now thats cool.  Send me a tell when you can."
I always have positive reactions with that even if I have never talked to
the person before.  Also gets me guild invites into some of the better
guilds on my server.
