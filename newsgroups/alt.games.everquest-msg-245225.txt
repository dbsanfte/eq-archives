Looks like we're shooting for a pretty simple dkp system...which means 
we're going to find we're in agreement.

Hmmm... I have. You wipe 6 times and it takes hours to do all the CRs 
rebuffing, arguing, etc. Then you finally get the strategy 
(positioning/timing/procedure) right, the mob goes down. The next time 
you duplicate it and if mob goes down...your done... after that its just 
refinement.

I'm interested in what goes in different dkp systems in general to 
highlight issues with dkp systems in general for the OPs benefit, and to 
get opinions on what does and doesn't work well in dkp, I'm not arguing 
the E'ci system exclusively. The E'ci bidding system isn't bad.

The E'ci system could probably go to a more duration based encounter 
system instead of points allocated to a mob. But seeing as the points 
allocation is apparently an estimation of raid duration its not too out 
of whack.

I don't care for the restricted classes stuff in the E'ci system, but 
considering it was public system you don't have normal guild means to 
filter jerks and asshats out... so its probably an ok compromise.

However it still relies on someone who was 'trusted' to monitor 
things...that amounts to an LC on some level. In a guild situation that 
person would be the leader or high ranking officer... where it could 
easily be abused... on a public system the power hierarchy is more fluid 
so abuse while possible, would not be tolerated for nearly as long.

If your suggesting I think people should be tracked on 10 minute 
intervals or some such nonsense than you're the one beating on a strawman...

I'm suggesting at the end of the encounter, when you would allocate 
points for who was in on the kill, I would simply allocate points based 
on the length of time the encounter raid took rounded appropriately (no 
14 minute 22 second raids...) instead of some fixed amount that may or 
may not accurately reflect how difficult the raid was  today. In an open 
system with people coming and going, I would expect there to be 
considerable flux in the raid composition and cohesion... what is easy 
one day might be hard the next... and trivial the day after.

Ideally our two systems would allocate the same number of points. Mine 
simply adjusts to the actual difficulty automatically... yours requires 
somebody sit down and figure it out and publish the numbers 
periodically. And its subject to discrepencies due estimation errors and 
raid composition dynamics.
