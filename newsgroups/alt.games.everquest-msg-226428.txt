I think you should have more confidence in pacify.  Using silent song of
quellious I can walk right up to a lulled mob and pull on his nose and he
takes no notice.  Pacify is supposed to be even better.  The only time it
has failed me (besides resists) is when someone tries to run right through
the mob or pull right over him.
