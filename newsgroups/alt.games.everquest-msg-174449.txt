Various - first  you dont always get costs paid for you in a normal suit
you dont happen to lose (as opposed to a frivolous one) - There was alibel
one recently which went that way.

Also conditional fee agreements and insurance for oppsing costs can be
taken out.

Also we have a number of lower courts, like the small claims court whre
simple things can be done pretty cheaply...or at more limited expense and
where if the other side bring in 8 lawers and work up 10 grand worth of
costs the presiding magistrate can simply decide was not necessary..IIRC
