Great story. Makes me even more inclined to check the game out. One question,
though, for those that have played it: is there a built-in time commitment? For
example, in EQ the only real time commitments are guild raid times and such. But
in SWG, if you have a house or harvesters they periodically need attention in
order to keep running (well, harvesters do, anyway). I don't mind maintaining
stuff in a game, but with current RL demands, I can really only take on one game
that has built-in time commitments. Is there anything like this in CoH?

TIA
