}>   The game is up, and there aren't any GMs on?  Sounds like a problem to me.
}I had this happen to me as well. Lost items in a cancelled trade and

}on for another half hour. Eventually got my stuff back though.

A half hour?  You lucky, lucky, bastard...  The last time I lost items in 
a trade (by going LD with containers in the trade window, lost two bags of 
stuff I was trying to sell) it was just after midnight on a tuesday.  The 
guide who answered the petition told me that only the server GM can help 
with that, and he has wednesday and thursday off, so could I email the GM 
and try again on friday between something like 10am and 7pm PST?

I did eventually get the stuff back.  But two days seemed an awfully long 
time to wait for help with a known bug.
