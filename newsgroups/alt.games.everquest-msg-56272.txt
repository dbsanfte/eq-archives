I can tell your one of the bards i would prefer having a non bard play .ie.

Your main uses in a high level group are .
1) playing mana song for the casters in a caster heavy group.
2)crowd control in the absence of a chanter
3)providing junk buffs to be dispelled against dispelling mobs
4)providing necessary resistances for slackers without resist gear

Fear kiting is a fine method of killing particularly if you lack tanks and
are caster heavy ,ie when they would pick up a bard for manasong. A tank
cleric chanter group has very little use for you as a bard so most of your
groups will be like this. This is why they grouped you , if they have no
tanks at all chances are they are gonna be pissed if you insist on swinging
your toy weapon instead of giving mana like you are supposed to . We realize
you dont like being this bored but really its your use so live with it :p

If you dont like to have sow you are a particularly foolish bard . You can
play 3 songs with minor song cramps . Its alot more effective to use
dammaging songs than to have to use part of your singing to keep your speed
up . Seems to me that you are bragging that you run faster than sow which
you of course do, but actually doing it requires a full 1/3rd of your
capabilities where sow itself just sits there so nicely.
