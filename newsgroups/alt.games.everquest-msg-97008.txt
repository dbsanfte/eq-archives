I think there is also a recognition on Verant's part that many people
are going to play more than one game.  I'm playing EQ and DAoC, for
example.  The days of "pick one game and play it exclusively for two
years" are over.

Right now, there are two games (at least) that are out and being
agressively developed besides EQ.  First, there's AO.  I've never played
AO, and half expected them to go away after having the worst launch in
MMORPG history (Luclin had worse aspects, but Verant fixed them fairly
quickly...whereas AO took months), but they survived, and from what
people I know who have given them another chance tell me, they have
gotten their act together, and the game is working fine now.

Second, there is DAoC.  They've been quite active since their launch.
They have added a new "epic" zone in each realm, which is basically a
zone a bit bigger than South Karana, organized so that you work you way
through the zone (like a traditional dungeon crawl, but outside),
culminating in an ubermob.  They have added a level-restricted RvR
battleground so 30-35 people can do RvR without getting ganked by level
50's, and next week's patch will give two more battlegrounds, one for
level 20-24, and one for 25-29.  They have implemented a system where
guilds can take over enemy keeps, which gives the guild bonuses as long
as they hold the keep.

AC2, Shadowbane, WoW, SWG are all coming.

Note that a lot of the things that are being improved now in EQ are
those things that, when you play some EQ after playing one of the other
games, make you think you've become a contestant on a Japanese game show
instead of a player in an MMORPG.
