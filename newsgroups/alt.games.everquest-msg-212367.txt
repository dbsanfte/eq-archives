It never sat right with me that God really wanted us to run around a 
garden naked and ignorant for eternity.

One reason of many, that I view the Bible with skecticism as any sort of 
historical account. Others may choose to beleive it word for word 
(though which translation to choose must be difficult for those who take 
this route...) but I do not.

I generally restrict my reading of religious texts to elicit more 
abstract themes, moreso than literal ones.

Why get angry about it if it was part of the plan? Or if it wasn't part 
of the plan why not simply unmake man, and redo it after whacking the 
snake... instead of condemning mankind to thousands of years of 
misery... no there is no point arguing points like this... it goes nowhere.
