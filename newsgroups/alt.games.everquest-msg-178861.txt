Well there are a few new Rain spells, but I rarely use them because I
find their usefulness limited and there are too many resists to my
taste.

No new PB-AE spells after 65, but then again AEing 20+ mobs like in
the good old Sebilis/Fungus Grove days, would not really work in PoP.

A better pillar spell for quadding would have been nice maybe...
dunno.
