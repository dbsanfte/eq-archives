   Your doomed as an Enchanter... Any Enchanter worth their own spit never
skips buying spells with exception of the illusion for your own race. I have
a 52 Gnome Illusionist (Enchanter) and she has all of her spells and she
even to this day still uses some of her level 1 spells. Her level 1 pet
helped her shoot 1-4 in a super short amount of time. I hope your Enchanter
is at least Agnostic, not that it matters to much since you don't know the
worth of your own spells. You should take some time and read up on what they
do and how they should be used. If your on a budget as you say get for level
1; Pendrils Animation, Minor Shielding, Shallow Breath, Strength, Lull, in
that order. For level 4; Animation, Fear, Mesmerize, Color Flux, Gate,
Invisibility, Haze, Suffocating Sphere, Tash, illusions, in that order. I
put the spells in order of best solo/group. Tash is just as important to the
Enchanter as it is to any casting class, remember just because you're an
Enchanter doesn't mean you can't be resisted and tash can help in those
situation where you can't afford to be resisted. Remember it's not a sin to
kill green cons for easy fast loot, you'll have all your spells in no time
if you do that. This is just my opinion on what you should do but I didn't
make 52 by not knowing what I'm doing as an Enchanter.
