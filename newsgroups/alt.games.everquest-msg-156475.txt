I had the same fears.  I started in Fport (actually started in
Felwithe but moved to FPort early on).  The time came when there was
nothing for me to really hunt in the FPort, East Commons, West Commons
area except Kodiaks and there aren't enough to get consistent xps, so
I moved to Oasis, then the Karanas, and onward.  You will die, but
everyone who plays a high level character has done so multiple times. 
If I can make successful corpse runs, anybody can.  My worse scares
were finding corpses in the vast open areas of the Karana plains when
I had to just get out my map and keep pressing my loc hotkey button to
cover the zone sector by sector.   I suggest that you go to eqatlas
and print maps of the zones you will be visiting.  At your level I
might suggest that East Commons is a good hunting area - you will have
to travel through kithicor to get there, just do it during daytime in
EQ (after 10am I'd suggest).  Eqdruids.com might provide some insight
on good hunting areas and strategies.
