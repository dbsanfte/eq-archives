Any of the three plate tank classes (WAR/PAL/SHD) can serve that role.
If you want to be able to rez for best xp return, you'll need a Cleric.
If you want CHeal (not a necessity for a group, but situationally very
nice), you'll need a Cleric.  If you go with a Cleric, a Warrior is
probably best choice for tank (most HP, maximises value from CHeal
when you get high enough to have/use it).  Alternatively you could
ue a Paladin to fill both Tank and rez roles.  If you do go with the
Paladin you probably want to have a Druid or Wizard for those nasty
CRs when the Paladin dies.  Druid or Wizard is attractive for evac as
well (first evac is Lesser Succor at L18, not too far away from start).
And don't forget that having a Druid or Wizard in the group means that
you can port out of that deep dungeon dive when you leave, instead of
having to fight your way out.

A possible crew:
1) Shaman (given)
2) Paladin (tank/rez, can heal to shorten downtime after hard fights)
3) Beastlord (damage, backup tank, some healing, eventually mana regen)
4) Druid (snare, port/evac, decent heals, DS/DD, tons of other stuff)

Everybody can heal to some extent.  Paladin makes a good tank, and by
the time his damage output is lagging noticeably behind the big damage
dealers he's offerring enough in other areas to compensate very well.
Beast Lord has good damage output and can tank in a pinch, eventually
gets mana/hp regen buff that stacks with everything, not a class I know
all thatwell, but I see them used effectively a lot in groups.  Shaman
has best slows in game, eventually has haste, decent healing, decent
DoTs, situationally useful nukes, more buffs than you can possibly have
on your character at once (and that's by L14, heh), gets regen 10 levels
sooner than Druid, limited tanking ability until high levels, very good
class.  Druid has so much to offer:  best snares in the game, best roots
in the game, nice selection of dots (including a line with a -100 resist
modifier), nice selection of nukes, damage shields, EVAC, ports, ...


just my $.02
