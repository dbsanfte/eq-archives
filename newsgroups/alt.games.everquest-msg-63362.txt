You will never get anything spectacular in damage, but you must remember as
your dual wield increase you will be hitting with the off hand more often.
My 50 monk is using a 12/20 in primary and a 7/18 in secondary damage I am
inflecting is just scrolling by. He hits in the 40s with the battle hammer
and low 30s with the Trance stick. I get 6-10 hits in for every time he gets
hit thats what you have to look at.
