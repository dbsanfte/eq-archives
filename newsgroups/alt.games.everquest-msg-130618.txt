<sigh>  I was having some sympathy for your position in this thread,
until that reply.  Yes, IN-GAME your reply was "okay then. thanks."
But you then came here and bitched about her, and are continuing to
spend an inordinate amount of time defending said bitch-fest,
referring to her as a "chick" (which, while some ladies don't mind,
many take offense to), and accusing her of complete stupidity and not
knowing how to play her class, and if one were to read your post and
take EXTREME liberties with interpretation, suggesting an e-bayed
account.  Wow, longest run on sentence I've seen in awhile.  Later.
