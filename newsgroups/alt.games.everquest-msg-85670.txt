And its no drop. Sold in the place near the bank that sells bags. Its
cleverly disguised as a "small bag". No Drop and as mentioned costs
over a hundred plat.

large races have hard time wiggling thru the hole, get stuck and

something.

btw- trick to sneaking thru hole is to get wedged in, turn left and
hit duck.
