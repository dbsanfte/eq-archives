it's not amazing, but it IS cool in pvp ... and if you take advantage of it 
with the other spells of this line, you might gain some pve benefit too...

consider standing on top of something tall and nuking something below .... 
it will run up (literally upward) to you ... if you fade/shadowstep, you're 
guaranteed to land someplace below ... if it happens to also be a bit 
further away along on the ground too, then you've got a headstart ... with 
the others you get much more range

you can use fade/ss/yonder to give yourself an extra cast before the mobs 
are on you, if you play with it ... and don't use it near water if you can't 
swim, it'll always drop you at the very bottom

it's a lot better than getting see invis late in the game, no? don't 
complain =)

you're not supposed to be beating whole groups of mobs at once, you're 
supposed to take advantage of close quarters fights (where maybe a rain 
won't work without hitting you)

and sure, you can chain it with a chanty who is chaining ae stuns, but 
that's a different tactic

different line than succor

if you cast this spell 10 times, maybe 1 or 2 times it will push you 
incredibly far from where you were ... if you're a gambling man, that can 
save your life...of course, it can make it much worse ... i always kept it 
up (fade's range was far less, so yes, i would call it useless except for 
getting down off of very high places and pvp)

i can't agree more

it IS a shame... you either have to blow mana on roots or tank, and both are 
terribly ineffective ... a snare would be fantastic early on....
