Somewhat irrelevant to the heated debate at hand, but I consider it my 
holy duty if I'm too late to save a hero in a losing fight, to at least 
defeat the villains he's started on, so he gets a head start to paying off 
the debt.

Also I've had times with my fire tanker when I simply could not survive 
the beating of the street gangs (young fire tankers are weak on defense) 
so I just ran in and did as much damage as I could before running away. 
When other heroes finished them off within a reasonable time, they still 
count against my quota.  (Several different chars or teams can get credit 
for defeating the same mob, if they have done enough damage in the last 
few minutes before the villain is defeated.)

The concept of non-claimable mobs is actually useful once one gets into 
the way of thinking.
