OKay, I have an update on this.  I replaced the cheap video with a Radeon 
7500 PCI.  It made very little difference.  Now both machines have exactly 
the same memory and video card, though the better EQ machine is AGP and not 
PCI.

So, that seems to narrow the difference down to PCI vs AGP and/o Celeron 
vs. Pentium.
