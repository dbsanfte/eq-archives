First suggestion...  get rid of that ugly background picture so your profile
is able to actually be seen.  :)

Next, you have crap on your monk that I don't bother to put on level 10
twinks.  We've long ago figured out that most stats are only marginally
useful.  The worst offenders are +dex and +str items with little or no
redeeming value otherwise, like executioner's hood, dragon bone bracelet,
cloak of shadows, gantru charm, sarnak hide mask and acrylia reinforced
gloves.  All those pieces could easily (and cheaply) be switched out to
provide more hitpoints.  I won't say choose hitpoints to the exclusion of
everything else, and thus why I won't mention the vah shir claw earring,
acrylia sleeves or legs.

Looking at your step up profile, your acrylia sleeves will be looking rather
ratty next to the other stuff you have listed.  For droppable, grey flesh is
the way to go.  You've still got the gantru charm when a goranga idol for
20pp out of Bazaar would give you more.  You're not getting the mask of the
dragon slayer unless you really enjoy paying through the nose for an effect
that you can't make use of.  Yeah, it's a decent mask.  Yeah, that wiz twink
is willing to pay hella more than you *should* be.  Check out dreadfang mask
for an effect that you could actually make use of, or for a cheaper option
darkmetal visor.  Also, the dream haunt leggings, though definitely a cool
name (and your profile is the first time I've even heard of them) are easily
topped by bloodclaw legs.  And necklace of superiority was the most
overrated piece of equipment back when it first showed up, and the fact that
it still fetches the price it does compared to *much* cheaper options with
better hp amazes me.  The resists aren't that great, and even in that regard
most neck pieces out there have some resists on them anyway.

You might also want to do some parses with your weapons switched around. 
You might be surprised how that will turn out with adamantine club in main
hand.  Another weapon option is waning light katar.  I'd definitely
recommend getting a good 2h for when 1h's aren't a good idea.
