By AC JBoots I assume you mean OT JBoots? I agree it seems to be far 
more time than its worth.

Ahh I didn't know this, thanks. Now I'm thinking the always on TBoots is 
a better option.

I'm pretty carefull when pulling and haven't got an add yet when 
soloing, so that hasn't been a problem.

I've specialised in evocation which is my biggest DD at the moment, and 
I also summon a DD improved damage focus item plus a spell haste and DD 
mana preservation item. On top of this I also have a BA Medallion with 
Mana Pres II to save mana on all other spells and have a pet focus item 
to increase the HP of the pet. Maybe picking lower level blues is the 
answer, since I have been picking the higher ones because they give a 
lot more exp per kill.
