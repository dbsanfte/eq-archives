Actually Martin, in the high end game, neither really count for much. True,
high ac lets you shrug off hits more, and more HP makes you last longer. But
when the high end mobs quad for 500, the only thing keeping  you alive is
the raiding force with you. Plus, by the time you can get items to get you
to around the 1200ac mark, you'll have a good 4k hp as a warrior. Most of
the high ac items warriors strive for have a good HP bonus as well.
