Whoopee.  I'm sure you believe that your Necrotwink is quite uber, but
that's still not "twinking" -- not in the melee sense of the word.  Not even
close.  Not even _remotely_ close.

About the only way to really twink a caster is with a clicky item (solist's
icy wand, etc.) and those are both more rare than corresponding melee gear,
and usually have level restrictions.
