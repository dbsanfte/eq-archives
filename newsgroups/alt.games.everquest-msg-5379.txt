And the best place in the game for spiderling silk has to be the
Feerott, full of jungle spiderlings and jungle spiders (which also drop
spiderling silk, not spider silk - go figure).

Of course, if you're not an ogre you're probably KOS to the wandering
bouncers, just like my druid. Still, they're big and dumb, so I can fool
them using 'Cute-doggie Form'.
