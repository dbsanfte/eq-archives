Looks like SOP to me.

My guild, a family to light raid guild, would schedule events.. sometimes 2
weeks in advance. It would take us sometimes upwards of 2 hours to get
going. Buffs were insane. As the only enchanter on several raids, I'd try to
setup a buff line (everyone who wants mind candy get in the line) but I'd be
getting random tells from people who won't listen to me.

I'm from Tennessee... originally from Texas, and I have no patience for the
slow myself.  My best example are the open Naggy/Vox raids that happened on
MT every weekend. I hit about a dozen of those before I leveled past them,
they were nuts. Litterally 5 hours of setup for 5 minute fights, delivering
6 items to be split among 30+ people. I saw like 4 through till the end. I
just couldn't handle the idiots, and the return on investment sucked... I
could have (and did) buy the same caliber gear for the plat I farmed in the
time it took to do 3 naggy raids.
