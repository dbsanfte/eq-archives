6/12/24 were the cutoffs for the title levels based on AAs I think.  6 in
general, 12 in archetype, 24 in class.

I'm approaching 500 AAs, so pardon me if those aren't right.  It's been a
while.  =)

Some titles are granted for having epic weapons (3 possible, for epic 1.0,
1.5 and 2.0), obviously different per class.  I think monk, mine, are
apostle, disciple and transcendant?  Something like that.  I've stuck with
Lord since the chooseable titles because it just sounds cool.  Before that I
was Sensei.

Some titles are granted for having certain levels of tradeskills.  I don't
do tradeskills, so until they give one for max begging and max alcohol
tolerance I'm stuck with apprentice fisherman for that choice.  There are
many, apprentice, journeyman and master for each tradeskill I believe.
