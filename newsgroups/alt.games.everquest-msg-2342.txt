Well, back when I made my troll warrior, I loaded up on bait and moved to
Faydwer at level 8.  Getting drink was a bit of a problem, but fortunately I
made a friend of a tasty female wood elf.  Oh, I know the number one rule
for trolls is to never make friends with the food chain, but necessity
demanded it.

The boats are no problem at all.  You'll simply use the smugglers tunnels
under Freeport to reach the docks there.  Remember to abandon ship before
reaching your destination docks, and stay away from the edges of the boat
while traveling; the Sisters don't like trolls at first.

Personally, I think EC and NRO are complete wastes of time.  I have probably
spent a total of one hour hunting in both those zones in the 2 years I have
played EQ.  You can cross Qeynos Hills and Everfrost Peaks off your list of
zones you'll be going to for quite awhile.  Do not let a Druid teleport you
unless you are going to the Feerrott, South Ro, and Lavastorm (I think).
The only problem with Druid rings is that there are druids at most of them,
and druids hate trolls at first.

If you group with "good" races, don't let them lead you to a new location
without reminding them that ANY NPC along the way will kill you DEAD DEAD
DEAD.  The final problem with being a troll is that the women cannot keep
their hands and eyes off you.  You will be flattered at first, but it soon
becomes a curse knowing that every nearby female is quivering with the
anticipation of getting a hug, a kiss, and maybe even a grope from you.
You'll have to become accustomed to knowing that nearby males will resent
you for your natural superiority and size.  It is hard to understand at
first, but you will get to know what I am talking about.  Well, I hope this
is enough to get you started.
