I'd like to take this opportunity, on behalf of all the lower teir
raiding guilds, to thank your guild and every other fucking uberguild
out there for taking up the gauntlet and charging off bravely into PoP.

Why?

We've gotten Fear, Hate, and Air to ourselves, along with the rares,
several times each since PoP came out, and we just killed VS two days in
a row. (Server craashed after the first one and reset everything.) Got
two wizzy staff drops in a row too, not to mention my epic. he he he.

The big guilds are all fighting with each other in PoP at the moment,
and the older content is opening up to guilds that never got a shot at
before if they couldn't race fast enough.
