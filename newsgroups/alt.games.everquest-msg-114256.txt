Yeah yeah, but I've seen some pretty strange behavior over the years,
like the girl who had been in the top server guild for a year, since
it had formed, was near the top of the heap for magician seniority,
and still ninjalooted something off Phin for her epic in a fit of
pique. Of course, she was thrown out immediately and no other guild
would touch her after that, and I believe she quit EQ within two
weeks. Why would someone do something as self destructive as that?
