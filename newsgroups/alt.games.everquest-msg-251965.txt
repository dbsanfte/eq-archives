It does seem ungodly slow, and the ratio isn't as good as your Cudgel 
anyway.  However, I'd like to point out that slow isn't necessarily a 
bad thing.

My cleric used to walk up to a fight in progress, swing, sit and wait 
for the tic, stand up and swing and immediately sit again.  Assuming the 
MA was capable of holding aggro over me even when sitting in close 
proximity and hitting occaisionally (most were, but its a concern, 
because if the mob -does- hit you for sitting it does max damage) this 
cost no mana and was just free damage.

WIth this strategy, you're only hitting once every 6 seconds, so any 
delay under 6 seconds is good.  95 is of course longer than that, but 
how much haste do you have?  Its entirely possible that that hammer is 
your ideal delay!  Ratio still sucks though.
