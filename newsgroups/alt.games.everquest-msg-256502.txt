Looking into the future at some possible gear upgrades, I note that both 
the Tunic of Wrath and the thurg quest tunic for Berserks have 
Invigorate as a clicky with a 15 second cast time.

Thats a 100 point heal every 15 seconds of down time.. spent standing.

At least two probably 3 ticks per 100 points.

These days, how much hp does sitting for a tick get you, on average? (I 
mean increased hp, over your natural+worn+buffed+aa regen)  It bumps up 
slowly, and more steeply every minute.  Plus you can bind wounds while 
sitting; heck, I BW for about 40hp per two tics, and I'd be missing that 
as well for standing and clicking BP.

I know this appears on some of the older Kunark class armors as well, 
and have no kick about Berserkers getting the same effect, its just that 
it strikes me that the effect isn't as good as it once was.
