EQ says there are no camps.  It's in the rules.  However, the fact is there
are camps and if you don't respect them you're labeled an asshole (and
rightfully so).

Was this person in a guild?  If they were /anon, type /guildstatus
assholename to find out if they're hiding from theirs.

If they're a member of a guild, do a /who all "guildname" and send a tell to
the highest member online and ask if the leader is on.  If not, an officer
will do.  Tell them what their guildy is doing.   If it's a guild worth
their salt, that asshole will be gone from your area or deguilded in a
second.  If the guild doesn't care, write off that guild as losers.

If they're an officer of a guild, find the leader and let them know.
If they're the leader, write off the guild immediately, and avoid at all
costs.

I'm a guild leader...if someone is soiling our name I want to know about it
asap.
