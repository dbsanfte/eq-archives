Hi there. 

I have recently been stationed in Germany, and the move here has given
me the opportunity to upgrade my embarrasingly ancient 'puter. I have
been looking at the options, and something occured to me today. How
about a laptop? I am on the road and in the field a fair bit, and will
be spending some months away from my desk in the barracks. So...

Will a P III, 1.13Ghz, 512 MB, 32Mhz video memory, and all the usuall
goodies be satisfactory?

I will have a docking station, a larger monitor, a keyboard, mouse,
and DSL at home in the barracks, and since EQ is not the most
important thing in my life, I think a portable 'puter is handy, even
if it won't handle EQ.

Since EQ is probably the 3rd most important thing in my life (sad, and
pathetic, true. But let's be real here folks... )I would love for
laptop users to send their opinions.

Hurry. I have been EQ-less for over a month.
