Did I mention that I have to assume these were just added as a joke?

In general Alchemy is a joke.  The potions are generally too expensive
and/or too difficult to make.  SoW potions being the obvious exception.
There is zero market for 99% of the potions.  There is a small niche market
for a few potions.  There is a decent market for exactly one potion, Blood
of Wolf (SoW).  That potion trivials at 37, or when the budding alchemist
reaches the level of 32.  After that, there is a small market for shrink,
ITU, and DS potions which trivial at 70(shrink), 42(ITU), 56(DS), and
136(better DS), then finally there are the gate potions which trivial at
180.  I would say that 90% or more of the potions I have made, aside from
SoW, I have either used myself, or given away, or sold back to merchants.
