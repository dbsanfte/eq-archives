Generally speaking, someone speaking the phrase "Inerrant, Infallible Word
of God" is the verbal equivalent of Godwin-ing out of an argument.

Now, having said that ....

If someone says that phrase and truly, honestly, and sincerely means it,
more power to them.  It still doesn't mean I want to argue with 'em ... but
if they're that convicted in their belief system, who am I to poke holes in
their balloon?  So long as they can settle for a "you believe your thing and
I'll believe mine", let 'em go about their merry way.

If they can't settle for that, though, there's no sense in even discussing
anything with them.  Separate yourself from them as quickly as the situation
will allow, head to the nearest Hooters, and have a plate of wings and a
Killians.
