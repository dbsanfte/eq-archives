I like fishing too, for some reason.  I guess it's kinda relaxing, and is
a relatively cheap source of food (you trade time for food instead of money
for food).
I hadn't thought of fishing in Crushbone... seems too dangerous in there,
but come to think of it, it wouldn't be dangerous for a character in their
mid-to-late-teens to fish there, especially near the cabin where the spawns are
at most lvl 11 or so.

In that vicinity, I usually fish somewhere in Felwithe, which is a very
(too) quiet place.

Thanks for the post!
