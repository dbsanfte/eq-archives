The magic number 46 makes me think of having a necro sacrifice them down to
46 (actually down to 45) to make essence emeralds.  These are the reagent
for the necro's rez spell, Convergence.  Each sacrifice is an un-rezzable
death.  If the person doesn't plan to play the character anymore he won't
care about deleveling and he could make some decent plat in the bazaar
(essence emeralds go for about 500p each on my server) or keep the emeralds
for later use.
