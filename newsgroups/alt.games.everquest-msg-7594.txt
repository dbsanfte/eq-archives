I am a lower lvl warrior so I can do these quests just yet, but I need some
info.

The Giants Warlord BP in Vellious:
1. who drops the ancient tarnished bp and is it no drop?

Warrior Epic:
1. can it be multiquested, and how do you multiquest.

I appreciate any help I recieve. After watching this news group for the past
few days, I notice that there are an abundance of helpful and respectful
people. I am glad a community such as this exists. Thanks for your time =)
