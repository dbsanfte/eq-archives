Since I got a few requests for the artist of my picture, I thought it
would be kosher of me to put in a plug for Evan Smith, the artist. :)  
He's a very talented guy.  I say that because he has a skill for making
your character look good but still look like an EQ character, and he is
very attentive to any details you request (provided you can give him
appropriate pictures to work with).  I haven't shown my husband's shaman's
picture yet because it is still being tweaked, but if you could *see* the
detail of his chain armor...it's freaky.  Evan creates beautiful pictures,
even though they are noticeably "stylized". (I'm not normally a fan of
"cartoonish" art, but I made an exception here.)

So without further blather....

A word of warning...this fellow is popular, and his life has been in a
little upheaval lately, so if you order from him, you might have to wait a
while. Many think the wait is worth it though. Oh, and he does have a
referral program, so if you do order from him, mention my name. ^_^  Or
not. It's all good.  I just think the guy deserves whatever business he
can get, because he's not only a talented artist, but a very very decent
man.
