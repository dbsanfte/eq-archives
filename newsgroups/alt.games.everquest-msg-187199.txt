*sigh* Y'know, I saw a comment of yours in that other thread and figured 
you must have slipped into the killfile somehow.  Sure enough, there you 
were, and I removed you because I thought it was an accidental add.  But 
I note that you *are* replying to WP posts, and so, well, no offense, 
but in case you're wondering why I'm no longer replying in the other 
thread - back you go.  Replies to posts like WP are just too noisy to 
deal with day after day after day.
