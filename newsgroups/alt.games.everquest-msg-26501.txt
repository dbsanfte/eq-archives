When the server's quiet, I've soloed dervs in WC with my 12 monk by annoying
one with a throwing star, running six of them all the way to Befallen,
zoning back to WC and picking off the straggler as they split up and walk
back to their camp. It's a terrible tactic in about 8 different ways
(deliberate training to a zone is a no-no I believe, abuses the zone method
for xp ('sploit?), endangers others, takes forever, sometimes goes wrong
(e.g. don't run through a YK doing this), effectively monopolises the camp
(meaning no sharing), sometimes the straggler is yellow or worse, sometimes
it's not quite out of range of the next one, etc) and I don't recommend it.
But you asked...
