It's usual for a melee in his teens to not be able to keep up all 
weapons.  I'd recommend choosing a 1H and a 2H skill to keep near max
and work on the others as opportunity permits.  As for Kick/Bash, if
you are not a race that gets Slam (Ogre/Troll/Barbarian) Bash is a
pain to use and to work on, it has some value (interrupting casters),
but not many bother with it.  [You need to set up your hotkeys to
allow quick swap between shield and weapon in the off-hand once you
have Dual Wield as you don't want to forgo the damage from your
offhand weapon, to be efficient you will have to keep your shield on
your cursor all the time when using the fighting technique, which
gets inconvenient.  I've used the technique, it works, and it amazes
those who don't realize that you can put inventory and gear slots
onto hotkeys (actually been accused of using a cheat program, heh).
But, for me the main effect was not the Bash skill-ups and caster
interrupts, rather it is the certainty that I do NOT want to play
a Bard.]

The earliest you're likely to be able to get all your skills maxed
together is in your twenties, and then only if you spend time solo
to do it.  Either xping solo, which requires decent armor and
weapons plus lots of bandages, or finding a group that doesn't
mind you working up your weapon skills on their mobs (no xp that
way, you don't join the group, but little or none of the downtime
you'd have soloing and the only relevent stat for your "practice"
weapons is delay).

One thing that does matter for offensive melee skill-ups is DEX.
You'll have a much easier time getting your various offensive
skills up if you get your DEX up over 100, higher is better.  If
you know a friendly higher level Shaman you might want to bum a
DEX buff off him whenever you see him, and if you are grouped with
a Shaman you should ask, politely, for a DEX buff any time your
offensive skills are below their level caps.
