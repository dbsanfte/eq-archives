<<<<<Many have tried.  You either choose not to see it, or can't quite grasp
it.
Either way, there's no sense in re-hashing it.>>>>>>

Try one more time, pretty please, because I just must have missed it. 

<<<<Perhaps if I were to have gotten a KEI on my level 18 necro, gone to the SK
spire that your group was sitting on, and started chain-pulling gnolls out
from under you, you'd get it.>>>>>

Did somebody's wittle wittle character get stolen from and thats what this is
all about.  I'm sorry for you and your wittle wittle hurt feelings.


<<<No, probably not.  You'd just tuck your tail and run off, spending another
hour trying to find a good spot that wasn't already taken.  Norrath's a big
place, right?>>>>

sorry, I wouldn't tuck my tail and run.  I'd just walk away.  It isn't that big
of a deal to me.  I can log on another character or do anything.  I wont stick
around and argue with the aholes.  It's pointless.  Kinda like these posts to
you guys.



<<<<Nope.  I don't resent a bit those who have gone on into their 60's without
having to deal with Hell Levels like I did.  Nor those who got there never
knowing what it was like to stare at a spellbook until 35.  Nor those who
got from 1 -10 without having to deal with CRs.>>>

Sure sounds like you do.

<<<<What I don't care for, frankly, is someone who doesn't have the balls to
deal with a change without putting out a whiny "This is going to ruin me
because I'm an older player with no time" post.  Probably because I'm an
older player and have no time as well, but I deal with it.  This game isn't
an entitlement ... no one here owes you a damn thing.>>>

Balls?  What you're somehow tougher than me because you can sit and stare at a
computer screen without doing anything longer than I can?  Lol, good one tough
guy.

<<<Start a warrior and shut up.  Hell, even better for you ... start a warrior
on the Test Server.  Not only do you have no mana issues, but you can enter
a command and zip right to 20 with a full set of gear!>>>

More ordering me what to do.  You should really just be concerned with yourself
and not whether or not me and my group got KEI or what type characters I should
play.

<<<<I'll be damned.  You almost made through a whole post without resorting to
some kind of insult.  You just don't have it in you, do you?

Crash>>>>

I could probably make it through an entire post of yours without insulting you
if you would just stop being so incredibly dumb.  Just worry about yourself. 
And please please please explain once and for all how me and my group getting a
KEI has a negative impact on your game.
