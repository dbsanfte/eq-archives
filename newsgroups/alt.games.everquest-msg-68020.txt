I've confirmed that my inability to patch recently is due to the inability
of the new patcher to function over a LAN using NAT/ICS.

I copied my entire EQ installation to the Gateway machine and patching from
there. No download problems at all. Try patching across the LAN from my main
workstation and the new patcher dies with:

"Internet connection error. Please check your internet connection and try
again."

I think that should be: "Verant programming error. Please fire your network
IT staff and hire people who have actually heard of Internet Connection
Sharing/Network Address Translation, which is a very common configuration
nowdays for many of your customers, and who are capable of writing software
which actually works with it (which 99% of net clients do)."

Imbeciles.
