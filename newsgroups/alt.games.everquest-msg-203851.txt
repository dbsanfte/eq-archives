No mobs became easier from the new xp rules. Folks aren't going to rush
to camp the old light blue mobs under the new xp rules, thinking it's
faster xp than they were getting on the blue-red mobs under the old xp
rules. They're going to stick to the same blue-red mobs (ie, same risk)
and just make more xp. There is no "risk reduced" or "easier camps".


>L10 to L60 have been noticeablly compressed by this change

... for those who only hang out in 6-man groups, yeah, kinda. The smaller
the group you typically hang out with, the less effect it has on you.

>and Necros have become noticeably more eager to group

*lots* of people have become noticeably more eager to group. In the pickup
groups I've been in lately, there's been no "do we *really* need to add a
4th/5th/6th member?" It's been "sure, come on over!". Guess Sony's attempt
at encouraging grouping has been pretty successful.

All Sony needs to do is add a loot multiplier for the size of the group
and special pickpocket cache, and the only reason left for turning down
people who want to join your group is because you think they're nimrods.
