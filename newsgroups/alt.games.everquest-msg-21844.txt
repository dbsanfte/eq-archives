Video card should be enough.  Failing that, There's allways the chose
inexpensive Geforce2 MX cards...

As far as RAM goes, you'll probably want at the very least 256 megs,
if possible go for the full 512.  As cheap as RAM is now, this is
fairly easy to do. 

But above all else, I'd do what I could to upgrade that chip and mobo.
Even with a full screaming videocard and ram, you can only go as fast
as your CPU will allow.  

As allways, check out www.pricewatch.com for the best prices around.
You can probably upgrade your entire system for at least two years
worth of games for around $300.
