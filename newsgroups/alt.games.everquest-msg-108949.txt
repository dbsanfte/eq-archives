LOL now I really know your  a) smoking crack  b) an idiot  c) both..

Regardless of their level, mana pool, low level of resistance etc, the fact
*you* don't see how much they heal for, the fact in a high end raid cheals
are almost NEVER for 95%+ of the MT's hitpoints..

if a guild has a tank with over 7k hitpoints then you can assume they are
pretty well geared,  so tell me why a higher end guild would need a 45
cleric, let alone allow them to attend the raid

Sont is all about keeping your main tank up, no friggin way in hell you
would let him drop low enough to perform a 7k+ heal
