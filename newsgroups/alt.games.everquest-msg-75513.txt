I received Everquest as an early Christmas gift. Previous to that I played a
lot of Diablo 2 - LOD. My girlfriend continued to play D2 after I got EQ as
only one of our computers have a 3D card.

Anyways ... I would constantly hear her grumbling beside me about how
immature people are on D2. People are constantly trying to "hack" or steal
other people's passwords, when you are in a game they try to steal your
items, there is no team work, dumb fools will go hostile with you for no
reasons and generally act very immature. They like to laugh at you when you
ask a legitamite question and are usually very insulting.

While she is complaining I am smiling to myself while playing EQ. Within the
first 10 minutes of playing I had a higher level character watching out for
me. They watched my back until I could safely adventure on my own. I have
had magic items donated to me (reasonable items .. no twinking), money, and
general advice. I have fought hard battles along side of some wonderful
people. People are always willing to help you out when you are in need.
(Thanks to all those who gave me ports and SOWs when I was on corpse runs).
So far my EQ experience has not been marred by a single immature incident.

My gf wanted to see what the big thing was about EQ so we  sat down and
created a rogue for her. She was shocked when people buffed her, gave her a
Cutthroat Insignia Ring and showed her how to get to the Freeport Tunnels.
"Why are they helping me?" she asked. I just laughed.

I do not know the ages of the people who play each game but the maturity
level of D2 is quite low while on EQ it is quite high. Probably having to
pay makes a big difference!

So in conclusion I would like to thank everyone who has been making my EQ
experience so much fun! Look for Wanaya the Half Elf Paladin on Bristlebane!
