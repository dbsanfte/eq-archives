First let me state that this has in the past been a great group, able to
have fun and exchange a lot of wonderful useful information.  I have been
reading and occasionally posting questions and recieving some great help.

And I will repeat there was fun and humor, fantastic.

Recent newcomers have turned this into a bickering cesspool of
one-up-manship. Each group trying to piss on the others posts to assert
their dominance, like dogs in heat.  I don't find reading that refuse fun.
The EQ related posts and humor and whatever (and even the occasional
good-natured immature fun (TH you make me laugh)) have dropped to abysmally
low levels and most posts are about how this person is that or that person
is something else.  Well to be honest this NG isn't that great anymore.
I'll be checking in occasionally to see if it goes back, but it wont be a
regular stomping grounds.  (save the sarcasm I know I won't be missed.)

As I see it there are two solutions to fix A.G.Eq, and make it great again:

1)  The newcomers (they know who they are) could grow up, show a little
maturity, and if they can't be even slightly relevant, go away.  But feel
free to stay if you can act like an adult.

or

2)  EVERYONE NEEDS TO STOP REPLYING TO ANY AND EVERY, POST OR REPLY THEY
MAKE.  Eventually the children will get bored and go away.

Hopefully this issue comes to some resolution because I loved hanging out
here, It's been fun, and I hope it is again.  Cya.

Thanks.
