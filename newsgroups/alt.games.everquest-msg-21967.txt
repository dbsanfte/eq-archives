Well, getting a bit bored with NRo Dervs and Oasis Orcs/Croc hunting.  So
last night I started snooping around for a new hunting ground.

After a bit of research I came across Unrest amd Befallen.  From the
reading, these two zone look pretty similar as to the way they're made up,
but having never been to either, I really can't judge.  I know that what you
read isn't always right on the money.

Any opinions or advice from vets of these zones would be greatly appreciated
... even if it's "Stay in Oasis for a few more lvls". <g>

TIA
Crash
