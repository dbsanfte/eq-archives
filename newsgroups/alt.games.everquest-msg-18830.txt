Ok, heres the deal with EQ, to gain money u need to level...........
All your chars are in there teens and have about 300pp each, thats great at
that level and you dont need the better stuff... a  full set of bronze is
fine if u are a warrior. i have a level 47 warrior and you start making the
cash at around level 30 when you go to LGUK... i now almost always have at
least 1k in the bank and at times have as much as 10kpp. You dont get the
cash by grouping and splitting the money u loot, u dont even get it from
regular cash (unless u are killing giants in rathe mts) you are supposed to
make your cash from items. The first awesome item i ever won was at level 38
or so when i won an fbss (haste sash now worth 9k, was 12k at the time) in
lower guk, i sold it a few months later at 12k  and then bought a new weapon
for 10k (a weapon that was worth 12k) and then went and won the item again
in guk after spending three days there, 8 hours a day. You need to work for
the money and quit complaining. You can only get cash by leveling, it is
impossible to have more than 1k total when all your character dont even have
a last name (which they get at level 20)

P.S. Dont become an ebayer for EQ cash or items, thats bullshit, work for
your money like u do in real life... and dont spend any more real cash on
this game, its just a game u know. And when u get your first 1kpp u will be
soo damn happy, trust me, u will wana do more fighting and get more cash.
Just get the items, buy low, sell high
