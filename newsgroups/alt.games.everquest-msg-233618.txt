Couldn't possibly be that you hit a bug, could it? My gnomish magician
has no trouble dealing with ANY of the merchants in Erudin palace, and
I HAVE tried every one. Oh, and her faction isn't ally... None of the
necro merchants have ever had any problem with my DE characters of ANY
class, and I've played every class available to them. (Yeah, I vendor
dive, which is why I've checked them all.)
