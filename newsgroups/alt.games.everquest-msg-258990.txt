    Unique access to non-shared content is huge. Take Qvic, for example.
Letting one extra guild in there doubles the length of time it takes to farm
for however long you wish to gear up there. Doubles. When you're already
talking about one month or more to gear a guild up, that's a massive amount
of time.

    And you're saying that someone who isn't a heart surgeon should be able
to suggest ways of saving someone in cardiac distress? Until you've seen the
effects of competition, you can't really say how or if it would help guilds
out with any sort of authority.

    The annoying things, and execution of the strategy, are the only
challenges in the game. Why take half the fun out of what you do? Martin and
I talk back and forth about stuff, but we usually stop each other before we
reveal any real "spoiler" material on encounters one or the other hasn't
beat yet.

    They do. You just need to learn how to read their clues, to think like
them. Once you do, everything usually falls into place and the only
surprises are triggered effects that happen partway through encounters. For
example: the first boss in Tacvi changes its melee damage output,
vulnerability to attacks, AE, spawns adds, becomes unrooted, and heals
itself at various health percentages. That's a lot of surprises, and makes
for a challenging encounter that takes time to learn, let alone defeat.

    Many encounters do have emotes and messages indicating what's about to
come. But those aren't nearly as fun as the "what the hell was THAT" type
that have you asking questions in guild chat from your bind point. Good
guilds, when hit with a surprise, react fast enough to gain information
necessary to overcome the obstacle before wiping, or they actually overcome
it on the fly. Lesser guilds just wipe, then try a second time to learn what
they need to learn to defeat it. That's how guilds get separated into "good"
and "not as good".
