All I have to say is if they ever did make dragons a playable race, I
would demand that they be made PvP automatically. The "l33t d3wds"
that exist in every game, were intensely concentrated into the dragon
race in Horizons. This made them perhaps the most irritating group of
players I have ever had the misfortune of sharing a game with. I want
them PvP just so I can hunt the annoying bastards down. Let 'em start
out at level 50, I don't care, they can't fit through half the zone
lines anyway.

Every player of a dragon seemed to be thinking when they picked up
Horizons: "Hmm. Dragon huh? That'd make me the baddest assed toon to
ever walk the planet. I'll take it." Now, I'm sure there were
exceptions to this but I didn't meet any. (and perhaps my overall
dissatisfaction with the game has colored my perceptions.)
