The book...if it's the Tome of Order and Discord, or whatever it's called,
destroy it.  If you give it to the Priest of Discord, it makes you PvP
(Player vs. Player) on non-PvP servers.  It puts you in a very tiny
minority.  People who are not PvP cannot ever buff or heal you.  This makes
playing on a non-PvP server very difficult.  Most who turn in their book to
the PoD on non-PvP servers find gaming so difficult that they eventually
delete their character.

If for some odd reason you want to play PvP on a non-PvP server, you can
simply ask the Priest of Discord for a new book.

As far as joining up with the Knights of Thunder at the Karana Temple in
South Qeynos....there are some quests you cannot do unless you tell them
you'll join their Temple, group, or cause.  Telling them that will really do
nothing to your standing with anyone....it's the actions taken during the
quests that will determine your standing with other groups.  Words are
cheap, actions prove who you are.

You're a Qeynos Half-Elf Paladin.  Are you with the Temple of Life, or the
Temple of Karana?  If you're from the Temple of Life, they have a close
working relationship with the Temple of Karana, so you won't be in any
trouble by doing stuff for them (many quests will improve factions with both
Temples).  If you start out in the Temple of Karana as one of its paladins,
then technically, you already are a Knight of Thunder.

Safe journeys!
