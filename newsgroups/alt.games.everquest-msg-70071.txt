Well I don't have the same problem at all and my system is probably
miles below yours:

tnt 16 meg agp, 384 meg ram, asus p2bx mboard, p2 400, SB pci 128
(ensoniq chip with no new drivers forever but no problem (yeah, there
are a new driver set at creative but they are for ANOTHER ensoniq chip
PCI 128, goofy yeah, so my drivers are pretty old now) Windows 98
patched up to the most recent via windows update, nvdia site 12.41
drivers because they still work better for me than the newer 23.11
which I just tried again (more slowdown with transparent inventory for
me with 23.11)

I have ALL models enabled and social animations ON, textures set to
LOW, texturecache=TRUE (in eqclient.ini under defaults, or in the
options area in EQ) texture compression off (since it says it slows
you down and tnt 16 meg does not support it in hardware)

The set up default options are SCREWED to say the least. They tell me
to not have many new models on and to have textures on HIGH. Well,
textures on high cause me to use ALL of  my system memory then 900
plus meg of my perm swap file which i had limited to 900 meg so I
crashed. Using that much swap is really not good so I put it on LOW
and then I only use 499 meg of my swap file in EQ at its worse.
Cacheman:

www.outertech.com

Is a great program for seeing exactly how much of what you are using.
It also has great presets for caching and diskcache (or vcache) for
whatever use your computer is for such as for example "gaming." 

If you also use 98, not limiting your vcache could mean that a
valueble chunk of your 768 meg ram is used for disk caching while its
not going to really help EQ at all and is more of something you'd want
to use system memory for if you were running a server. Cacheman can
put the line in your system.ini for you or you can do it manually like
so:

[VCache]
MinFileCache=9216
MaxFileCache=13312

That is mine, cacheman suggested 26 meg for diskcache for gaming but
after playign around with it I found setting it at 13 meg was more
than enough probably. I tried limiting it to 100 meg once and after I
got out of EQ it had indeed got that big meaning that 100 meg of my
precious system ram was beig used for the vcache which, once again,
did not seem to help my perforamnce in EQ one bit anyway.

Of course with 768 meg ram you might want that larger, possibly 45 meg
or less to start? You probably want your agp apeture in your bios set
to 256 meg, and your agp apeture plus the size that your vcache can
get (in 95, 98 or ME, mind you) are added together for the amount of
memory addresses being used. When that number equals or exceeds 800
meg or so you can have problems.

The texturecache=true command in eqclient.ini is just to make loading
faster by unpacking textures to your hard drive, so I don't think its
the culprit at all in your case. I'd try setting textures to LOW in eq
options and seeing if it still does it. After that I'd check how well
my geforce 3 is being cooled and if your power supply has enough power
for it. Its kind of sad to say but geforce 2 and 3 are actually far
more tempermental than my old tnt 16 meg agp piece which always works
fine though it may bog me a bit. Try turning off dynamic lighting
maybe if you have further problems in options also.

If you don't already have mip mapping turned off, turn that off also.
Basically you want to turn off as much as possible, much like I have
for performance reasons, THEN if you don't have your texture problem
anymore gradually scale back up. I am actually very amazed with how
well I do with my now fairly long in the tooth system in Luclin. 

In fact, due to the clipping being far more adjustable in Luclin (to
the point where I can not see at all or just a few notches out) I
actually do FAR better in Luclin zones than in old world ones like
freeport where clipping does not seem to do ANYTHING (even with it all
the way end I see as far as you can ) Meanwhile in a luclin city like
Shar vhal if I bring clipping all the way down its like I am in a lil
area in a sea of blackness but boy can I move like a bat out of hell
;) I then up clipping just a couple notches until I can see well
enough to navigate. In luclin outdoor zones I don't have any problems
and can see quite far without lagginess.
