Had my target disappear after a recent patch - saw some other coments on
this - hadn't seen anything about solutions, but partially tracked down
something...

Using the SiS integrated 64 meg 4x AGP setup.  Well, for maybe another week
anyway.  Still, got an update to the drivers off the XP automatic updater.
Then circle was gone.

Didn't make the connection until a nasty browser hijack convinced me to wipe
and reload everything - had the circle back - updated the driver for the
video and 'presto' no target circle again.

Wonder if anyone has any additional info,, REALLY like the circle but some
other functions, like far clip stability, are much improved so not sure
about rolling the driver back...
