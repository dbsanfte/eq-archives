And you almost get it. For the best soloer there are only 2 things of
importance. Sustained dps and dammage mitigation. You recognize that the
monk, along with all other melee classes has a sustained dps 10 times that
of a druid , you are half way to enlightenment.

When you realize that a shamans slow and armor along with a mild regen are
enough to cut the dammage he takes to nothing , and that his pet provides
sustained dps, and that his dammaging dots are every bit or more effecient
than druid dammage you will realize that a shaman is not just better but
much better.

When you realize that necros mitigate dammage by fearing the mob so it never
does dammage, and that they have a pet that provides dps along with dots
that are every bit as effecient as a druids you will realize why necros are
such good soloers. Sks use the same method.

For melee classes to get over that hump soloing all they have to do is
mitigate the dammage. My monk does this with a regeneration near 40. A rogue
does this using enstill doubt and engulfing darkness. Warriors do this with
weapons that proc a slow spell as well as using defensive. Ranger epics use
slow as well. Then we get to weapons that proc lifetaps and things get
really interesting. And all of the above can bind wounds to 80% now with
just a bit of work.

Most people dont understand soloing since most really dont want to do it in
the first place. If you can get a group there is no need to solo. Soloing
can easily slow your rate of exp gain down and certainly reduces your loot
to basically nothing. The question then is why some classes seem to solo so
often. If the answer is because they cant do anything else, which I think
happens often, then you have a problem.
