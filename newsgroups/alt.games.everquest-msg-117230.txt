They thought the bazaar would be in already when that book came out.
The bazaar is still not in since they are holding off doing it until
they FINALLY finish the new UI (which was supposed to ALSO be
in with Luclin) They STILL have no ETA for either except to say that
they will be in "certainly before planes of power comes out and not a
part of planes of power." 

Prima is a known successful publisher of game strat guides. They got a
lock by contracting the "official" guide from the game publisher, or
once known the game publisher approaching them way ahead of time to
make the guide. Often the guides are not even written by someone who
has played EQ, so the guide writer is just going by the reams of info
verant submits them whch they then try to arrange in a nice way with
nifty charts and drawings. Some of the past errors in the original
kunark guide may have been the writer taking license to fill in the
holes of the verant info ( I remember one mention of dwarves being
welcome in neriak, which is of course not true.. I doubt if verant
gave the writer info saying that )

I don't know why no one else has made a "better" Everquest guide with
such things as quests. So much good free info is on the web that it
would not be hard to do. The reason might be that Prima has such a
publishing monopoly on game guides that stores might not take one from
an lesser known company or unknown writer. If approached Prima would
proabably say no since it would compete with their guide. 

Prima has a REAL monopoly at this time in strat guides, for every
console platform and the PC.
