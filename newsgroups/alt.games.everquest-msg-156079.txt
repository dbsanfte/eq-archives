Doubtless he'll feel neglected if you haven't upgraded him to a
Massive Underbulk Shell by L25.  Oh, and don't forget to go see
your NPC trainer after you kill another bat and ding 6.

Kaev <--- grew weary of detesting Paladin twinks a year and a half ago,
but often wishes he could slap "Pally" twinks from here to next Tuesday,
and remains astonished by just how badly some people can play a mid-40s
Paladin, you'd think they'd have gained at least half-a-clue by then.
