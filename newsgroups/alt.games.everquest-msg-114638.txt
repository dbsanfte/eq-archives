A guild that isn't an uberguild shouldn't be using uberguild loot
distribution methods.  A friend of mine was in one of the top uberguilds
(Legacy of Steel), and assigning loot worked fine for them, because they
raided several nights a week, in places where everyone had to contribute or
the raid would fail, and they all understood the game very well.  Also,
there were not many players leaving the guild, so if you see an item you
want get assigned to someone else, you know it is still going to benefit the
guild.

Assigned loot works in that situation because generally everyone will agree
with the leader's assignment...they all have the same data, and all know as
much about the game, and everyone has played with the leader enough that
they know they guy, and trust that he isn't biased.

In a non-uberguild (which the guild above clearly is...uberguilds don't have
level 52 clerics at this stage of the game), these conditions generally
aren't true.  Assigned loot will almost always lead to trouble, with people
feeling that the assignments were biased.  Also, as people leave for higher
level guilds, there is resentment if they are carrying away awarded items.
There usually isn't as much resentment if they are carrying away items they
rolled on.
