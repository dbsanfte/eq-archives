Interestingly enough, I agree.  And yet, I also agree with the post you
replied to.  How's that?  In-game, WoW isn't too bad.  On the community
forums, however, WoW displays a maturity level...  well, it doesn't display
any maturity level at all actually.  =P

Guild Wars in-game has a lot of the same type of stuff that you see in WoW's
community forums, but strangely the community forums for Guild Wars are
considerably more mature than you would expect from what you see in-game.

It's a paradox that I really dunno how anybody could explain, especially
considering that the target audience was the same for both (for those who
don't know, Guild Wars was made by ex-Blizzard employees).
