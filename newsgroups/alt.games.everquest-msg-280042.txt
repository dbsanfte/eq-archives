You're reading way too much into this. We have no intention of
transporting ourselves back in time to pre-Kunark or anything like that.
We use the PoK books. We will use the corpse-summoning facilities in the
guild hall. The primary stipulation will be how you acquire the money
with which to pay for them. If you can't afford one, then we will help
each other the best we can. A large part of this is commitment to that
idea and to other who share it. If you lose your corpse and can't afford
a soulstone, hopefully there will be a guild necro or sk on to summon it
for you. Worst case scenario, a guildmate could just give you a
soulstone or the money to buy one.
