The GMs aren't really there to provide technical support. Petitioning
in game wastes your time and the GMs time. And hurts C/S for people
with legitimate reasons for contacting a GM.

Your machine may have cost you $3000 when you bought it but it's not a
screamer by today's standards, and waving the price tag around won't
fix it.
