No, they are not. Not even close. Back to school for you.

They are contractions of  the phrases "do not" and "can not" respectively,
and thus, abbreviations.

And a shortening of the word "through" and thus, an abbreviation.

I put plane and bus in deliberately, as words that had been abbreviated from
the original word and are now accepted use. They are obvious abbreviations
from the more formal names. All you list above are abbreviations as well.
What on earth makes you think they are not?

What broad dislike?     What non-standard abbreviations?  Is there some
"Committee of Standard Abbreviations" to which the would-be abbreviator must
apply?

Who says an abbreviation can not be pronounced. Who enforces it? This is
some rule I have never heard of. You didn't just make it up did you?

You seem to think that there is some rule for an abbreviation. There are no
rules, apart from shortening the word or phrase. My dictionary gives as the
first definition; "a shortened or contracted form of a word or phrase used
in place of the whole". If it is shorter, it is abbreviated. Therefore "do
not" to "don't" is an abbreviation. I can even make up my own abbs if I want

Do you have a source for the rules of what may or may not be an abbreviation
or are you just deciding on  personal whim?
