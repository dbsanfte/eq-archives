No. Anything beyond pen and paper would violate SOEs rules. Hell, even
writing it down probably violates their rules.

Go *read* SOEs rules. 

Ok... now that we've got that rubbish out of the way... you might want
to rephrase the question:

Is there any way to get the info and stats on one of your characters
that doesn't require signing up to anything, isn't pen/pencil and
paper, and is pretty unlikely to be detected/ and get me banned or
charged with violation of copyright [& dmca if your american].

The answer is yes: Acquire the tech magelo et al have built, either
from them (though i've heard its not free-for-the-taking), finding
somone who's done it and made it available, or ... do it yourself from
scratch with what resources are available.

If someone else has already done this... I don't know of it... but
maybe someone else does... good luck... I'm curious myself.
