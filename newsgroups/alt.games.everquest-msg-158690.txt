Loot everything, and I mean everything.  Even if it sells for only a few
copper.  There are merchants in Shadeweaver and a banker and a Guild Master
to boot, no reason to even run back into town.  The coins will add up
eventually and you should have more than enough money to buy Jonathons,
Lugubrious, and Magical Monologue and Elemental rhythms.  (For the record,
just twist in Hymn, Jon's and CoB or CoD at this point.  Elemental is nice,
but not nearly as nice as CoB and Jonathans together.)
