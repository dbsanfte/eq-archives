I dunno 'bout you oobur efficiency freaks, but I've been in many,
many groups where Haste was dealt with on an as needed basis.  In
fact, I cannot recall Haste being treated as a prep-only buff
except for very challenging fights where we were taking care to
have all casters at/near FM and all buffs fresh before engaging.
But, I 'spose out there in the rarefied air of upper tier PoP
everything is done by the numbers and by the book, lest the DPS
drop by .01% for a second or two or the AAxp/hour fall below
99.99997% of optimum.  All I know is that back in the grubby
world inhabited by ordinary peons you'd damned well better have
a knight backing up a Shaman who's expected to handle slow+haste
and also be primary healer (and if your knight is an SK he'd
best be trigger happy, jumping all over any mob that he suspects
might be considering going for the Shaman since SKs don't get a
panic instaheal to recover from misjudged agro).
