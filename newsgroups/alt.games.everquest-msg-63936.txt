One of the few "gimmicky" ideas that Verant has come up with that I 
actually liked. I guess with Luclin apparently having 3 keyed dungeons, 
there were getting to be too many keys in EQ. I like your idea about a

I'm guessing that means more weapons with bane damage on them, like the 
Iksar Shadowknight weapon, Greenmist.

I had heard two, so I was a bit surprised when I saw 3. Of course, some of 
that space was wasted with stuff (I was tempted to use the word "crap") 
like Tanarus.
