I'm thinking that since Win95, there has been Win98, Win98SE, Win2k Pro,
WinME & now WinXP.  Since you readily admit that 10$ a month is no big deal
& since you were obviously aware of the release of new operating systems,
might'nt it have been prudent for you to tuck away an extra 10$ a month for
a new OS?  I mean, really, 10$ a month is 120$ a year.  Win98 has been out
how long?  I'd hazard a guess at 2 years, at the least.  This means you
could've socked away 240$ in that time, which would be plenty to go buy
yourself a copy of WinXP or even Win2k & solve the problem of not having an
OS that supports the latest DirectX.  You had to know that, at some time,
your hardware & software would become obsolete.
