I have a friend who is playing a druid.  What, in your opinion would be the
best compliment to the Druid considering the fact that we MAY be just
playing the 2 characters and not trying to get into groups very often.  Just
looking to hear opinions.

Thoughts for my character include:

Cleric, Enchanter, Mage or possibly Bard.

Classes I'm not considering:

Warrior (Druid could never keep me healed after 30....

Necromancer (while good, I would have to choose Dark Elf, and I played on
and did not like having to worry about being KoS)

Monk - can't play night-blind character, and teh iksar would have same
concerns as necro...)

Shadow Knight - same concerns as Necro.


Thanks for any input.
