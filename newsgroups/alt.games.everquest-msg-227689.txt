It would seem, at first glance, to have a pretty serious unintended
consequence...  It encourages looting minor upgrades, as then you lose less
"credit".

The difference may be, if this works well for you, that at the level of mobs
and numbers you are dealing with, this issue doesn't come up.  I could
definitely see it coming up in a guild the size of mine, where it's
acceptable to go two months without looting anything, then looting three or
four times in a week when the drops you were waiting on come available.
