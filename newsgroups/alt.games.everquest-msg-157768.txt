So I'm wrong then?  EverQuest is inherently addictive?  And it's nothing to
do with the personality of the player at all?  It's entirely and solely down
to the content of the game, and some ingredient that makes it impossible to
put down once picked up?

No.  You've just repeated my point.  Some people ARE addicted to EQ, yes.
But it is not the game that ensnares THEM, it is their own psychological
makeup which leads to their dependency on the game.  And it would be just
the same whatever the game.  There will always be people who have problems
of dependency like this.  It doesn't mean the game (or whatever) is at
fault.  Of course it's not strictly their fault either, but what I'm trying
to say is that going on some ridiculous crusade to ban this that or the
other is missing the point entirely and won't help one damn bit.
