You cant. Tried last night with a friend in NFP. Hes level 18 gnome warrior, and
wanted to test out his new 2hs weapon on my level 44 druid. For some reason the
guards got pissed and killed him, and i got the protection message when trying to
heal him.
When he respawned something got buggy, so to seemed like we were still in Duel
mode. Couldnt sow him, he had to camp before i could sow him.
