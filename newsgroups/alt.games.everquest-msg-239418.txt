I've had people call me a racist over usenet before (I defended the legality
of the south's secession prior to the Civil War, which would have been
upheld in all probability had they taken it to the Supreme Court), and a
Nazi for saying that Hitler was the greatest mover and shaker the world has
seen (evil, to be sure, but he did cause a rather large stir when he arrived
upon the scene).  Yes, slavery is wrong, and yes, it would have been much
better if Hitler had died due to the mustard gas attack he was in in 1918.
It's kind of the dilemma that many defense attorneys find themselves in when
they defend someone that is truely reprehensible.  Dispassionate logic and
legality are important, just don't expect everyone else to understand when
you use them.
