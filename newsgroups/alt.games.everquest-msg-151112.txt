On the FV server, the ability to solo is nice due to the lower
population (though I've never personally had trouble finding a
group).

I solo my wood elf druid frequently in order to keep important
skills up (i.e., Offense, Defense, Dodge).  I can't keep them
maxed out through grouping alone.

Sometimes I'll solo when I know I'll have to leave on short
notice.  I don't like to leave groups with only a minute or two
warning.

When I'm testing new techniques and spells (such as charming
animals to do some fighting for me), I wouldn't want a group
to suffer while I learn and potentially make mistakes.

I frequently solo when I know I only have 20 or 30 minutes of
play time (it'd take too long to organize a group).

At times I solo when I need money.  I tend to loot infrequently
when I'm in groups (not because they're looting too much, just
because that's the way I am).

I often solo when I'm actually doing something else, like reading
a book.  With all the downtime, I play for a minute or two, read
for 5, play for a minute or two, read for 5, etc.  I got through
quite a few Wheel of Time books this way.

Fortunately, I have two computers, so I can also read and post
to a.g.e while soloing.  When I'm doing something else, I don't
feel that a group should suffer from my lack of attention.  I'm
the only person that should suffer if something bad happens
because I wasn't paying attention.

LOTS of reasons to solo.  :)
