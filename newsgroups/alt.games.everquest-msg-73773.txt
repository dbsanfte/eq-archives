Thats fine for other mmorpgs but not fine for one like EQ where your
gear is the all important character power factor and where such gear
requires incredibly long camping or the effort of an entire guild. It
works in an mmorpg like DAOC where the best armor is really player
made and it all degrades while its really your stats and abilities
which mostly make your character. 

The big money sink in EQ is horses and solves the problem you are
talking about quite well. In fact it solves it TOO well. The horse
money sink has destroyed the player economy because no one really
wants to trade items for items of similar worth now and no one wants
to sell things for reasonable prices for the most part. Everyone only
wants money for horsies so everyone is trying to sell things for the
very top market value while not buying anything. This is not going to
change once enough people get a horse because then they are all going
to find out they are not really that fast and start it all over again
for the higher priced faster horses. Horses as one big very desireable
money sink all their own with no previous money sinks seem to have
been a very bad idea. Sure, everyone is sellling now but the problem
is that no one is buying (and not because they have better or because
stuff doesn't decay)
