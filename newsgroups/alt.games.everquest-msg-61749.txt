Which is the exact reason you NEVER skimp on the motherboard when you build 
a machine.  Well, you shouldn't skimp on any of the parts because you will 
spend more money in time fixing crap hardware than you will have spent 
buying quality parts in the first place.

When you buy a cheapo machine from a little-known maker from a local place 
or off of the 'net, you are most likely going to get a crap motherboard.  
Why?  Because they are going to be buying them in bulk for $10 a piece and 
figuring in $50 into the price of the machine.  Integrated sound and video 
on the board?  They love it!  They pay $15, and charge you $90 for it.  
Seems like a sweet deal until you have to fuck with the cheapness.  It 
takes me a looooong time before I trust any brand of anything or put it in 
one of my machines.

Typical friend call: "Hey, they have this CDRW for sale for $50!  I'm going 
to get it!"  "What brand is it?"  "Wakashitty."  "Don't call me for 
support."  The second my buds put crap in their computer, they lose me as 
support, and they know it.

I think I will save that excerpt about motherboards you wrote to quote to 
people when they want to buy some cheap-ass motherboard.  You put it much 
nicer than I do, and it has a nice ring to it =)
