Just for the record, after reading some of the combined wisdom, both
here and in other fora, I took the plunge and started research at 20,
though the guides say to wait until 24. I went to the trainer and put
points in. Sadly, I didn't count how many I managed to get in, but
shortly I got the message that (paraphrased) I couldn't advance this
skill any more at my level.

I had a metric buttload of words from various characters collecting
them, and so did Tiru's various alts, so I gathered them up, trashed the
ones that didn't apply to Necros, stacked the doubles to save space, and
went to work.

I made some level 16 spells that I already had first. I got a message
that I "couldn't advance my skill any further" and had 100% success.
(Tiru's not yet sixteen Necro already has all the researchable spells up
to twenty. <g>) I went on to make Hungry Earth (the one I was missing
from sixteen, our first root spell) and had no problems.

Next I moved to the level twenty spells. I didn't get the "can't advance
your skill message" and I did have a few failures, but I was still
successful in about 3 out of 4 attempts. Thankfully, we both now have
all the researchable 16 and 20 spells and a nice stockpile of words for
the future. Yes, it would probably have been safer at 24, but for anyone
thinking of doing it at 20, it worked for me. The showstopper is having
the words, but we were just lucky having saved so many on a lot of
charactes over time. Plus, trash shopping at vendors turned up quite a
few more.
