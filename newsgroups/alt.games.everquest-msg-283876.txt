     Sounds pretty general to me.  Then...

"I thought they were to assist with the mana. My bad??"

     By "the mana" we all know you mean *your* mana

"Most I've found want to nuke the hell out of mobs, waste their
mana... and not be supportive of the group. Comments?"

	Hmmm, also sounding like a general comment... and lastly..

"Well the dps of a necro (thinking they are sooooo needed for
damage)..."

Well, you sure got comments - as you requested.  If you came here for
a shoulder to cry on and a group hug, after those little gems - tough
luck.

No, you stomped into here, saying the role of a Necro should be A, B
and C and then spent the next several posts ranting, because a Necro
didn't live up to (gasp) YOUR expectations.

>I came to discuss a bad incident and learn through discusion from people who would know.

No, you came to vent, as your pal said today.  Only by your fourth
post did some specifics of your "bad incident" start emerging in any
real detail.

Total crap.  I've solo'd two characters to lvl 70 almost entirely, and
have learnt to be self-sufficient in a few others.  Other characters I
have group a lot.  Depends how I feel.  And there you go, telling
people how they should be playing again!  :D

Actually, no - it's ONE of the ways it should be.  One of the myriad
ways it should be, actually, depending on how a player wants to play
HIS/HER character.  Not how *you* want them to play it.

No, in 6 years I think I have a handle on Everquest, thanks.  :)

I don't think listening to your whining is worth it - I'd rather die.
Oh, and try to learn the rudiments of the "D" key, eh?  Getting to lvl
59 and not knowing something as elementary as that... sheesh.
