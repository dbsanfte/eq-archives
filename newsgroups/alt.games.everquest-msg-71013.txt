A "me too" post follows:

I have encountered several problems like that. Specifically, when someone
auctions "WTS Foo 1.3k" I see, "WTS Foo 1  K" this same problem seems to
manifest itself in tells to me, which causes a big problem, I show up with
1k to buy something and they think I'm shorting them 300p.

I also saw this in a recent Guildchat, I was offering a Teacher's Syllabus
for sale to the guild, and noone wanted it. I couldn't understand why...
until they told me my post which SHOULD have said " +3wis, +20mana (whatever
whatever)" came out as "+ wis and + mana".
