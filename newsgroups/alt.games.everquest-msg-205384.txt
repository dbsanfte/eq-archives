It's an acceptable risk. Heaven forbid SoE doesn't actually spoon-feed
you all the way to your end-game.

There is always a way to retrieve your corpse. There is no such thing
as, "I can not retrieve my corpse so I will sit there until it rots".
You are either completely inept, or you just lack patience. Even if
it's impossible (corpse at the bottom of OOT, or stuck in a wall), GMs
will always be there to help pull your corpse to at least a safe
distance.
