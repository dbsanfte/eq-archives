Three food changes will be in the next patch.

First, all food items will have a "hunger satisfaction" class. "Snack",
"Meal" and "Heavy Meal" are definite; "Light Meal" and "Banquet" are being
played with. Basically, the character will have a rundown timer measuring
how hungry they are. Snack items (such as store bought muffins) will move
the counter up a little bit, meals a bit more and heavy meals a lot more.
If the counter goes down too far, you will automatically "eat" the first
food item in your inventory, just like you do now. It is expected (although
this has not shown up on test yet) that non-alcoholic drinks will work the
same on a separate "thirst" timer.

Second, you can deliberately eat food and drink non-alcoholic beverages in
the same fashion you drink booze. Thus, you can specifically chow when you
want rather. If eating the item will put your hunger timer over the top,
you will get some message along the line of, "You are too full to eat
that!" and the item will not be consumed. This is important because...

Third, some few baking items will give stats boots. Eating a scorpion
sandwich (1 scorpion meat and 1 bread combined in an oven or spit) will
give you +1 vs poison; "paladin pickles" from Boomba the Big, Ogre pickler
extraordinaire outside West Freeport, will give you +1 wisdom. These
effects are NOT self-stacking (you can not eat three pickles for a +3
wisdom boost.)

All this comes from folks who are actively testing new changes on the Test
server.
