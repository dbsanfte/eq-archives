Actually, that's the other major indicator of a shit group.  If the
cleric insists on burning all/most of his mana to buff everyone to the
gills when it's totally unneccesary.

In a exp grind group, outside of the main tank and maybe the enchanter
(depending on the kind of camp), no one else really needs every buff
in the book.

Last time I played a rogue, during a 3 hour camp, I think I got hit
three times (3 failed evades).  With my monk, maybe 7 times--each time
I just turned off autoattack and the mob switched back to the main
tank without problems.

The simple fact is in a well run group, an extra 6 mana/tick isn't
going to be a huge impact in terms of overall effectiveness.  On the
other hand, an extra 20 to 30% damage output for each of the meleer
will.
