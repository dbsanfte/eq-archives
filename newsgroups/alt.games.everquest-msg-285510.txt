I tried playing EQ on my desktop using my verizon phone as a modem, and 
found it virtually unplayable, and I used to play via 56K modem.  Slow 
and choppy even with all the bells and whistles turned down, but that 
wouldn't have been enough to stop me; trouble was I went LD a lot, and I 
mean a lot, five minutes on average.  Its possible the situation would 
be better with a stronger signal, or that the technology has advanced in 
the three years or so since I tried it, but at the time, in my 
situation, it wasn't really viable.

If it hadn't been for the LD problem, I could at least have worked 
tradeskills and chatted with my guildmates, reserving combat play for 
when really online instead of on the cell... but that didn't work out so 
well.  I was able to play the game Anarchy Online via the same cell 
modem setup, again, choppy, but much more forgiving of my poor connection.

As a seperate issue, I am running EQ on a couple of low end notebooks 
right now, and again, with all the bells and whistles turned down, the 
game is a little slow and choppy, but the big difference is no LD's. 
The notebooks are using a wireless 802.11 connection via my home 
wireless LAN, I hear in many areas there are free WiFi connections 
available, say at McDonalds or your library or so on; haven't yet tested 
to see how viable play via this is.  Its apparantly impossible to buy a 
notebook which DOESN'T have this capability these days, at least I never 
saw one while looking around, being careful to check that whatever I was 
  looking at had something installed.

Advice I got (which I wasn't really able to implement) was to go for a 
higher end processor, and a name brand video chip with its own memory 
instead of sharing processor memory, and to get as much onboard memory 
as you can afford.

If you can solve or avoid the LD problem, I'd advise playing a pet 
class, mage or necromancer, as they are less sensitive to lag than other 
EQ classes; with melee DPS you have to worry about positioning as mobs 
tend to get pushed around, with tank classes you've got to worry about 
responding instantly to losing aggro, healers need to time things very 
tightly on heals if they are going to be at all efficient, pullers have 
to be able to navigate and FD and so on with split second timing, and 
the CC classes need to rapidly pick and mez. A bard would be right out. 
  Would a wizard work?  A group wizard would, I guess, but a solo one 
would be right out.

My son's mage works almost as well when laggy as when things are running 
smoothly, because his pet will keep itself in range and facing its 
target, and his casting of DS isn't time sensitive, and his timing on 
nukes is generally "after aggro is well established, and before the nuke 
will be partially wasted on an almost dead mob."
