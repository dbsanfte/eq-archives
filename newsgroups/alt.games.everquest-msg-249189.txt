It's been explained properly in several posts here. It works off the
average level of the group, and its based around the *3/*8 level (ie
average level 23-28, 28-33, 33-38, etc). Google search should bring it
up.

 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
