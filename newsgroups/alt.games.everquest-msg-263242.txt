I'd *strongly* recommend waiting a couple of months before seriously
attempting to start fresh on a Zek.
World of Warcraft is (allegedly) being released in a month or so, and it's
almost certainly going to hit the Zek populations hard - definately in the
short term, and maybe long term as well. Quite possibly hard enough that SOE
either looks at changing PvP (again) or starts considering server-mergers.
