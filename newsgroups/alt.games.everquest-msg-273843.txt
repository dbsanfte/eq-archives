When someone says, "You pussy," at least in the English-speaking subcultures 
I've lived in, they 99% of the time mean, "You wimp" or "You coward". This 
word has been used for so long to mean this when in certain contexts, that I 
believe for many people it has lost any sexual connotation, whether you are 
trying to say it has something to do with the speaker being called a female 
or a reference to the vagina. Same goes for "dick". When someone says, "You 
dick!" they typically mean "You are being mean." They are not disparaging 
the entire male sex and it is commonly accepted to not be a sexist remark.

I believe we (and Blizzard) should be more careful about making rules for 
things you can't do. Especially when we are talking about communication.

One thing I'm curious about. When he says, "Leetspeak," does he mean using 
characters & numbers to make up a word like to say pussy you would type 
something like, "|>...$$..."? Was he using that method to say "pussy" in 
order to get around the language barrier between horde/alliance? Or to get 
around the "harsh language filter" sensitive people can choose to turn on? I 
wonder if it was investigated by WoW as to whether the "poor victim" of this 
harsh language had their "harsh language filter" turned on? I apologize if 
this was revealed already somewhere in this thread and I didn't see it.

Many of you are attacking this guy and telling him to "suck it up" and 
otherwise be less sensitive. What about what I consider the oversensitivity 
of those who choose to take offense at certain words? I think we all have 
the capability to choose how we take shit. And if you choose to get pissed 
off because someone called you a "pussy"...? Come on, people!

And I really hope the whole "leetspeak" fad really is a dying fad because it 
is annoying to try to read that shit and to me tyipcally reduces my respect 
some for the speaker. But do I want rules to keep them from doing that just 
because it annoys me? Fuck no. It would mean it's only fair for someone to 
make a rule against me using some favorite intensity-conveying term of mine 
just because some churchmarm with low self-esteem chose to be offended.
