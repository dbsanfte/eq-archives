The reason that Verant pretty much has to support 3dfx cards is because 
originally EverQuest was designed with 3dfx cards (using Glide) in mind. 
Many people bought 3dfx cards specifically for EQ because for the longest 
time they were the best choice for EQ. They would lose a signifigant 
percenage of their player base if 3dfx cards (at the very least Voodoo 
3/4/5s) weren't supported.

The problem with the Kyro II cards (Hercules Prophet 4500 and others) is 
that the Kyro II uses a non-standard rendering method (tile-based 
rendering). For Verant to make alterations to their engine to support 3dfx 
cards is fairly simple, since 3dfx cards use standard rendering methods.
