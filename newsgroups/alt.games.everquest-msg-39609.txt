It's simple. Here is an example for your Dwarf.

Get a SOW from one of them lovely friendly hippies (druids) in Gfay. From
here, go to Crushbone. Invade the castle, and run all the way through,
jumping out the window at the very end of it. Try not to fall into the
water, or you are in trouble.

Run back round the castle, across the drawbridge, and back towards Gfay. You
have now trained sucessfully!

Remember not to tell anyone about your train, as the surprise will be all
the more welcome!

Welcome to the World Of Everquest! ;)
