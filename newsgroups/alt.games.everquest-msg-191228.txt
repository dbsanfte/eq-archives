Very insightfull.  I'd reccommend reading this to all EQ players (or
anyone interested in it).  I read both the part about addiction and
relationships.  I think you've got a real handle on this.

Interestingly you make some points about onlne relationships that seem
quite positive to me.  And Oddly enough I think I'm more paranoid about
people in online games than in RL.  Perhaps because of the anonymity I
have run across many who do and say negative things they would never do
in RL, even moreso on the PvP games/servers.
