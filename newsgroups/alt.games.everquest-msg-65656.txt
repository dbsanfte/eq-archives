  I think the problem is that then they would have to simultaneously support
two separate versions of the end user client... which would probably be a
pretty big strain on their available resources.  It wouldn't just be as
simple as not adding "any new features" to the client.  They still have to
do bug fixes to the old client and enable the old client to view at least
some new content.  Whether they let people play on one server or all, it
still will probably take about the same amount of resources for the
programming team to keep a version of the client usable with Windows 95.

  I personally wouldn't want to play on a server with only Windows 95
players, anyway.  The Firiona Vie server is one of the only things that are
keeping my interest in EQ.  The other things would probably be the friends,
comrades and associates I've formed on my current servers, which I'd also
lose if forced to play on one server.

  I can accept that Windows 95 is obsolete, but I would have liked a little
more warning from Verant that they were going to be discontinuing support.
One day we are assured DX8.0a will be the minimum requirement after the next
day's patch, and the next day we find out, surprise, DX8.1 is needed.  The
most sad thing about the whole thing is that they obviously did only cursory
tests on the DX8 engine that they released to the public for mandatory use
for their players.  It wasn't the same engine we played on on the Test
server, because that engine, for me, more or less worked in their last
revision.  My guess is that there were coders tapping away frenetically at
their keyboards to "fix the engine" even as their ETA for bringing the
servers back up came and went, and the result was no warning for DX8.0a and
Windows 95 users that they'd be left out in the cold, and a buggy game
engine for half the people who could access the game (after they could get
in through the congested servers that probably would not have been half as
congested if the engine were available for download while the game servers
were down).

  Ah well.  What are you going to do? :P
