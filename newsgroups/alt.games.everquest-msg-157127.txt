There's your key right there.  Any class should be at least adequate in all
three areas of the game.  Druids are excellent soloers (yes, I know,
Celaeno, you don't like to, but you _can_ and that counts for something),
and average in raiding and grouping.  Clerics are essential in raids, and
average in groups, but they can't solo for crap.  The proper fix is to boost
soloing ability.  Paladins are in an similar situation, we can't solo very
well until very late, we are acceptable in groups, and we are sub-par in
raids.... we don't really have a specialty area.

Now, bards, OTOH... we know not to complain about balance (which is probably
why Verant keeps tossing us goodies, we're quiet unless something is broken
in the game-mechanics sense).  We know any inspection of our class will end
up in a huge nerfbatting.  Still, our power can be seen as compensation for
being an.... involved class to play.

In conclusion:

1)  Half elf females need long hair.
2)  Warriors need manaburn. ^___^
3)  Let's nerf the nerfbat.
4)  None of these concluding points have anything to do with the topic at
hand.
