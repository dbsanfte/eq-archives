I'm closing in on 200 in all my resists.

With the DoN Warded Tear Stone and Warded Rose Stone I should be able
to remove most or all my LDoN resist augments and still be over 200 in
all my resists.

Obviously more is better, but how much do you really need?

I raid with an alliance once or twice a week so I need to avoid the
AoEs as much as possible, but I also would like to start clearing out
augment spots for use with focus effect, Regen/FT, stat augs. (etc...)

That's my magleo if you are interested.
