Correct, but only if you are assuming that someone outside the group
contributed the other 33%, meaning the only group members that did any
damage were the 2 pets. However, in your example if ANY PC group
members did even 1%, according to Absor, neither pet will get ANY xp:

Pet 1 (34%):
Rest of group (PC group member (1%) + Pet 2 (33%)) = 34% - Even dmg so
no pet xp (must OUTDAMAGE rest of group)

Pet 2:
Rest of group (PC group member(s) (1%) + Pet 1 (34%)) = 35% - Rest of
group outdamaged pet so no pet xp
