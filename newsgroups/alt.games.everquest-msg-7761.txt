    Since I was discussing super twinking a warrior, I'll continue to
discuss that plan, and again point out the ignorance I have of warriors, and
their uber equipment.

    For a Wizard, some of the best equipment is quest equipment, except that
the end item, and every part of the quest, is NO DROP.  So, assuming that
the very top stuff is the same way for a warrior... when it comes time to do
the quest... I'll have to do the quest with the warrior, in order to get the
NO DROP item.

    Now for quest items which are not NO DROP... well hey... I will have
done the quest with a wizard (where able)... what difference does it
ultimately make who I give the reward to?
