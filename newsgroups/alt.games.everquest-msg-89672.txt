Nope, not on EMarr.  Nobody "reserves" any of the Planes.
Nobody "reserves" the Dark Elves in Kithicor or Phinny in
Kedge Keep or the Arena in Kael (or Tormax, or Dain, etc).
The guilds that are capable of doing all of those may have
it worked out in advance, but lots of times it's just a post
on the EMarr board "Hey, we're raiding Hate Monday if
anybody wants to come," or "Hey, Gerry, we could really
use another Assassin in Sky right now...can you get to a
wizard spire and somebody will pick you up?"

Besides,the roamers in Hate repop quick enough that
you can get in right after a major raid and start pulling
'em again.  Exp is very good, and it's NOT like you're going
to be killing Innoruk with a group of 6 anyways, I don't
care how uber your loot/tactics are.  The only mobs folks
really care about are the named ones anyways.  Roamers
are more generally just yard trash that a named-raid
would be glad to have out of the way in the first place.
