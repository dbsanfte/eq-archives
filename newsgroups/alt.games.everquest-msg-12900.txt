Yeah.  They went to Sleeper's Tomb and did the following heinous things:

1. They had their clerics stand behind walls so that when the mob they
were fighting did an AE spell, it wouldn't hit the clerics.

2. They killed and ressed their warriors before the fight, so that the
warriors would be under res effects.  Apparently, the mob they were
fighting casts an AE slow that does *not* stack with the slow from res
effects, and the slow from res effects is less.

3. When a cleric would get aggroed from healing, and summoned, their
magicians would use Call of the Hero to summon the cleric back.

Verant says these three things are exploits.  Arguably, #2 is a minor
exploit.  #1 and #3 are not.

So why is Verant pissed?  During their fight, some quest mob got
involved and killed, which trigged the Sleeper's Tomb script, which
Verant says is complete and in the game.  It's not complete, and this
showed that once again, Verant either is lying about what is in the
game, or has no clue how to do QA.  Either way, it makes Verant look
like idiots, and so the guild gets banned.

Maybe it is time for another letter writing/emailing campaign to get
Verant to stop being idiots.  It worked when they kicked that guy out of
POM a couple months ago (Verant ported him back in, and he gave Verant a
tour of all the things in POM that appear to be broken (despite what
Verant QA says)).

Speaking of the lack of QA, on my server, The Nameless, one of the
uberguilds (Legacy of Steel) completed the Four Tears quest, which
requires killing a level 70 dragon who is on a one week spawn multiple
times.  Result: quest giver takes the items and gives no reward.  Yup.
Another testament to the awesome Verant QA department.
