Just install the software, it's not going to overwrite any critical game
files you dont already have, except the PooP files.

The only choice you have to make is to 1) Start new account with the "new"
basic game version that came with yer PooP, or 2) upgrade and existing
account.  My guess is you'd like to upgrade your existing account.
