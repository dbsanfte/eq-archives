I took on a lone caster bandit in WK just now, was going to try out
some kiting techniques.

I snared him and proceeded to drop stinging swarm and flame lick on
him while keep out of casting range.. I dropped 3 SS & FL on him. I
was nearing the zone to QH so I cast a damage shield and proceeded to
melee. I must have him hit him about ten times and the he the same
taking 7 damage each time. Three SS's & FL's, and probably about
150-180 damage from the melee, he must have taken at least 500 points
damage.

But all that only took him down -one- bubble of health. Going by that
he must have had thousands of hit points ! He conned light blue to me
at level 16. Is this a bug ?
