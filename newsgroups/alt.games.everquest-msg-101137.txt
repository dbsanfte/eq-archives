My suggestion would actually be to leave Shadeweaver's Thicket around 9 or
10. My GF's rogue started in Paludal Caverns around then (and yes, you WILL
notice an exp bonus.) You start out on Mud Burrowers near the ST entrance
and move to Muck Diggers and Sensate Reishis (large mushrooms) soon after.
If you find the right spots, the Reishis can take you all the way to around
25 (although it starts to slow down around 21 or 22 as you start finding
more green shrooms about.) The Reishis admittedly hit fairly hard, but I
believe that they hit fairly slow and don't cast Creeping Crud (like the
fiends,) so you don't have to constantly get cured. I think staying in ST
until 13 would be much slower. By the time you can consistently kill the
Loda Kai in the poacher/trader tunnel, Paludal is calling you with an exp
bonus and softer hitting mobs.
