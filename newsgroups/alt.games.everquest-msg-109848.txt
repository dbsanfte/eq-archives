How about Encumberance?

When you exceed your weight allowance, you slow down... and your AGL also
drops (when it hits 1, you can no longer move)

I realise that Verant aren't known for their stunning ability to grasp
simple logic... but doesn't it seem possible that in two distinct areas
where movement rate is noticably affected, the only common factor is that
AGL drops?

Uhmmm... isn't that the WHOLE FOUNDATION of Experimentation??? You create a
hypothesis (AGL has a bearing on movement rate), you TEST this hypothesis
(injured characters, overweight characters, Dwarves get dropped from /follow
more often than Halflings) and OBSERVE the results of those tests.

Sorry if this sounds rude... but it just irks me when people ignore
something they can easily 'observe' for themselves.
