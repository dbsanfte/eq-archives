Yeah it's pretty amazing.  I PL'd my sons SK there.  He dinged 14-17 in
about an hour and a half.  The place is getting busier and busier though.
When I first started going there the zone usually had about 16-20 people in
it.  Now it's 35-40 most of the time.  Used to be no one camped the Phlargs
because of that nasty crud, but now they are as heavily camped as the
Recondites.  I had to lead him way back into the caves just to find an open
spot.  No surprise though with exp. that flies like it does here word gets
around.
