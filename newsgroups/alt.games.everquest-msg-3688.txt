When you wait just play EQGEMS!!!

I got about 1 million or two points wairing for my camp!

Worst part is that I was solo camping to get an item I needed - someone
nearby yelled for help  so I aided him - then they asked me to group - I
said - sure but im waiting to get the named monster from here - I need his
item.

We then fight for about an hour with him and 2 of his buddies and the named
monster shows up - when he died I loot the item I had been camping and those
heathens insisted we roll for the item I was camping solo!

I should have killed them all ! Instead I had to /rude them all - so they
left.
BASTAGES!!!!
