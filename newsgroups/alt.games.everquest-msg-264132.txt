I've been in a ton of groups that were seeking healers and several seeking
pullers.  And some that were seeking snarers as well.

For very singular values of "several".    For 90% of single group healing,
druids and clerics are interchangable.   One for one.  (the other 10 percent
being rez)

One thing I'm seriously wondering about though... exactly how many monks
does it take to slow a mob?

So druids aren't enchanters and clerics rolled into one?  If thats what you
were expecting, no wonder you're disappointed.

Druids can't buff?   Wierd, guess I imagined getting steeloak or Bot9 at
every raid I've been to for the last two years.


> But going back to the point, just for a moment. Druids are needed because?

Healing, damage shields, nuking ability, snaring and evacs.

Yes, all of which can also be done by other classes.  Welcome to EQ.  There
are no abilities that are not shared by multiple classes.

> They are important to the game because? People say "we really can't do

For a single group situation, when evac and healing are both needed.   Or
snare and healing.  Or healing with more DPS than a cleric puts out.

For a raiding situation, whenever you want resists, mana regen and hit point
buffs, whenever spot heals are required, every time MGB heals are required
and every time you need DPS from nukers.

Thats fine.   After all, we're all doubting yours.

Aye.  She apparently bought her level 58 spell.

Did they upgrade Sebilis when I wasn't looking?  Velketor's Labyrinth?
Sirens Grotto?  Howling Stones?    If not, then a druid can definitely still
play main healer there even before level 58.    After 58, theres nowhere
that a good druid can't play main healer.    Riftseekers, maybe.

Maybe it's just you then.   I'm happy to get a good druid in my groups.
Hell, half the last week we went out with a shaman as the only healer.

CIHYS?

The same could be said of every class.   It wouldn't be any more true than
about these, but you could make the argument for every one.

See ya.  Don't forget to write.
