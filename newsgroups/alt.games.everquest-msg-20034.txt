I love to help out a real newbie, problem is some people will try to
pass off their new alternate character as being new to the game, I
really dont care to help them out, they don't need it. And yes, it is
frustrating at first, I almost quit during level 1, didnt know about
shout, /y all that stuff. But excepting the people who let me drown
(didn';t know how to swim) 90% of the people you meet will help you if
you ask nicely.
