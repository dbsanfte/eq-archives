When you crash out of the game, your character remains active for around 
30 seconds. You probably died during that time, and, if you are of a very 
low level, your corpse rotted. It's not really a bug, but a feature 
implemented to avoid exploits. Unfortunately, sometimes it backfires on 
people who have less than perfect connections.
