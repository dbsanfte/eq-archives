there was a time when we (me and my group) were medding and a caster mob
attacked my pet of all ppl....
so my pet....curagously charged at a mob of 4 monsters....training them to
us....  luckily my group was full and strong enough to take them.

and we had an enchanter to mezz a few of them while we took them out....
the caster even casted a spell on my that made me run around uncontrollably.
first time this happend..was very weird for me not able to control myself..
