I always use a pet while in a group. I may not use a pet if I am only 
root rotting- it may be hard to back the pet off the mob. But usually 
Jobobber is by my side where he belongs.

The only one that is ESSENTIAL is your defense skill. Keep that maxed at 
all times, because it will increase your AC when it goes up, and necros 
have precious little AC. I stopped carrying any weapon at all around 16.

Yes. This is the prefered thing to do for necros. Necros should laugh at 
anyone insisting on KEI. You may want to try it with Leech too- the 
lifetap over time. I love to cast that last of all my dots, and it will 
sometimes continue for a while after the mob dies- sit then, and end the 
fight near full of health and mana. =) Then go get the next juicy mob to 
snack on.
