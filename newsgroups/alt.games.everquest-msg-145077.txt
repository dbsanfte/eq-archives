The best possible way to pull safely each and every time is hire an
enchanter
to save your butt! With a good enchanter, you can pull half the sarnak fort
and survive. You pull, announce the train to the chanter, and he area mez's.
Rule #1 whatever you do, do NOT lead your train TO the enchanter, lead it
about 20 yards away from the enchanter. Then when the group gets area mez'd
you pull the one you want FAR away from the group. This lets the enchanter
keep area mezzing the mess till you play patty-cake with the one you like.
Then
you step up and pull one more out away, rinse repeat. This works GREAT if
you can find someone to donate a SOW to at least the enchanter.
