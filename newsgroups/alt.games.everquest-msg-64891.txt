oh.. sorry to have 2 posts here but I just thought I would point out some
things
my level 1 Erudite enchanter I had probing Luclin was like a foot shorter
than a level 60 Erudite necro, that was a neat effect to make higher levels
stick out more.... great now more clarity requests =P
I cant wait to get my own acct with SoL (I installed from friends CD's, his
Christmas present...), I want to see if the wolves are really good as they
look.
and about the gfx engine, I think they should have started testing at the
LEAST 2 weeks earlier, its reminding me of DX7, it was sucky for me for like
a week, then I was able to use sound again, but gfx were messed up for a
couple months... I got a faster system now that should run it fine, I think
its just the vid drivers and their new engine
