Thanks for the suggestions.

I've done relatively little soloing.  Most of my experience until now has
been in small groups.  I really like working with a same-level Shaman.

I've been through BB a few times, to & from Halas.  Never hunted there.
Never been to Lavastorm, either.  I may try that one; my brother needs
poison supplies.  Once I hit 19th, I'll be doing a lot of hunting, looking
for my own supplies.

As for the Walrus Tooth, yup, picked one up already, brought it back to
Freeport on an egg run.  (Do you know how HARD it is to find a good supply
of $)%*# Snake Eggs!?!)  Sold it for 175 Plat, which'll pay for a few more
eggs, if I can ever convince the up-and-coming twinks to hunt and save them.
You wouldn't believe how many bat wings I pick up off discarded corpses.



Fun trivia:  Ever know anyone who uses the term "poppycock" to avoid
swearing?  Next time, tell 'em that "poppycock" is the English corruption of
the Dutch "pappekak", which means "soft shit".
