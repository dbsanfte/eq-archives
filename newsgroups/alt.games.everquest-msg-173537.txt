I always find this little tidbit of information amusing:

1995 (Sept.)

In Washington, DC, Arafat and Rabin sign the 24 September Taba
agreement, known as the Oslo II agreement, expanding Palestinian
self-rule in the West Bank.

1995 (Nov.)

In Gaza, two suicide bombers detonate their vehicles near Israeli
buses, wounding 11 Israelis.  The Islamic Jihad claims responsibility
for the attacks.


Do you really think that if the Palestinians had heavy military
equipment, they'd limit their attacks to military targets?  The vast
majority of the suicide bombs and car bombs are nowhere near Israeli
military units, sites, or bases; they are specifically targeted
against civilians.  That's the difference between the two sides.

(Frankly, I don't think Israel should have been created in the first
place, but that's another argument entirely.  That one we can
primarily lay at the British and French doorsteps.)
