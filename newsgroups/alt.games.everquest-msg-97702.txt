Since you brought up the concept of "the burden of proof" in an
earlier post Ben, I believe it's fair to note that the burden lies
with the positive claim. In this case, specifically, your claim.

You may think it's ridiculous to be called upon to prove this, but you
are obligated to operate under the same requirements you make of
anyone else in this thread.

I think it's statements like "use your fucking head" that drag debates
into flamefests. The fault for the flamefest is laid at the feet of
the first one to flame.
