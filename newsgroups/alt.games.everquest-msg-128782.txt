Cut clerics some slack, they are among the most boring classes to
play. I personally wouldn't and don't want to see cleric power lowered
in relation to druid and shaman for that fact by itself. They heal.
And heal. And heal some more. And then heal. And heal. If they're in a
group that can afford it they can toss a stun in every once in a
while. Oh, time to rebuff. And heal. And heal. And heal.

I have the utmost respect for clerics who can handle that all the way
to 60. Takes dedication and a real sense of team play.

Everything on the priest side seems pretty good right now, though one
more spell druids could use in high end encounters would be nice (but
not expected, due to all the other advantages druids continue to
enjoy). EQ balance is in good shape atm.
