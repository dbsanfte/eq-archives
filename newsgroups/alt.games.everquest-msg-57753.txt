I didn't say change it so that mobs could not go through buildings.  I
said change it so their paths don't take them through buildings (in
fact, make it so their paths are far enough from the buildings so they
won't aggro on people in the buildings).  If someone cast on a mob
from the building, it could still come and go through the building.

This makes buildings mostly safe, without opening up any exploits.
