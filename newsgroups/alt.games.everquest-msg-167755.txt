Heh. You should try an Ogre Shadowknight or Troll Beastlord. The low
agi/dex/int/wis makes it tough to learn *anything* quickly :)

An inaccurate characterization. Anyone with spell skills can practice them
outside of combat. Casters certainly don't have any free pass for improving
melee skills, which would clearly count as "things that are used in
combat". My 24 enchanter could gain ~125AC just by maxing out his Defense.
Like that'll happen...

Well, casters and hybrids can do it. Melees can't do it since they don't
have any spell skills. But *some* melee skills can be practiced outside
of combat, like Intimidate, for example.

Also, note that hybrids often have to do both: spend time outside of combat
practicing up their noncombat spell skills (divination and conjuration,
perhaps) *and* work on melee skills in combat.

There's only 2 improvable skills in the game you can't put any training
points into: Offense and Defense. That's it. Melee and hybrids tend to max
out Offense in less than 1 yellow after levelling. MTs (whether melee or
hybrid) tend to max out Defense in less than 1 yellow after levelling.
The only situation that doesn't just magically solve itself with zero
effort is how those who don't tank improve Defense.

Note that casters, even despite their much lower caps for Offense and
Defense, tend to lag *way* behind in those skills.


>Also from what I've read all skill up are int/wis related, not
>the biggest stat for those classes.

Nope. Defensive skills (Defense, Dodge, Parry, Block) go off Agility.
Offensive skills (Offense, 1HB, 1HS, 2HB, 2HS, Piercing, H2H, Bash, Kick,
Double Attack, Dual Wield, Archery, Throwing, Backstab) go off Dexterity.


>So caster in nexus, melee in mortal combat see my point? One is fast and
>easy the other is brutally slow.

(1) Mortal combat maybe, if i turned off autoattack and went AFK for a few
minutes. Just because something's blue doesn't mean there's any risk
involved. Fighting Needlites was mortal combat for my 25 bard, but a tame,
predictable grind for him at 29. The situation may change at higher levels,
of course.

(2) Practicing in nexus is tedious and doesn't get you any xp. My troll
beastlord spent 6 hours chain-fizzling conjuration spells to max out his
abilities that first time. Sign me up for more!


You've also overlooked a few options:

Shout "paying 100pp for uber dex and agi buffs" in nexus. Duel a friend
who has a commandable pet. Beat up on their (blue to you) pet. Let it beat
up on you. Have friend order "/pet back off" when you get low on hp. Watch
the skill ups pour in. Safe and boring, just as you ordered. For excitement,
have your friend practice his spellcasting skills while you practice melee
skills. See who maxes out first!

There's a trap at the top of ToFS (so I've heard) that can give you Defense
skill ups. Let it thwack you until you get low on hps. Back out, bind wounds,
med up, go back in when you're ready.

>For what its worth some ideas:

>Allow skill up on any con of mob.

About the only fix I'd consider. There are already enough "offensive"
skills you can practice on greenies -- Pick Pockets, Intimidate, Spells,
Songs, Beg, Disarm -- I'm not sure what purpose it serves to specifically
disable it for melee skills.
