Nope, it works from the top/first buff slot down.  So you
can junk buff, good buff, then refresh the dispelled junk
buffs and never have to worry about the good buffs.

It's common to always have at least one insta-cast item
that throws a junk buff so you can simply recast it
whenever a buff gets dispelled, at least once you get
to raid levels.
