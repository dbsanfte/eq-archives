A few zillion bone chips should fix that right up. :)

As I recall, the guard at the OT dock paths back and forth along the dock.  
It should be possible to swim out north of the dock, target the gnome, and 
swim in and chat with him while the guard is out of aggro range.

I don't know if something similar is possible in FV or not.  But yes, I 
miss the boats, too.  They were fun.
