This newsgroup discusses two games, Everquest and Everquest 2.  Since 
Everquest was here first, the consensus was that if there wasn't a lable 
you are talking about Everquest.  Personally, I'd prefer all headers 
with either EQ or EQ2 in them, but that is just me.

I've never recieved a key in the Everquest tutorial.  So either I've 
never recieved a key because I've never run a rogue through the tutorial 
or you are refering to EverQuest 2 which I've never played.  Either way, 
I am unable to help.  Good luck.  With my EverQuest rogue I had to have 
the lockpick "in hand" when opening a door, perhaps?
