This is not a hack, cheat or shortcut, but higher level characters are
always looking for tradeskill items, foraged goods(if you have a new ranger)
and other items.   Have him collect Spiderling silks, bone chips, foraged
vegetables and ground spawn ( things that glow on the ground).  He can make
some quick cash in almost any newbie zone selling to passing high lvls.

People often give new players stuff that they have no use for any more but,
DO NOT BEG FOR MONEY OR ITEMS!!!!

Ask people what they are looking for and get it for them.  Saves them time
and makes the newbie good money.   Also allows you to get to know people by
trading with them.
