Heheheh aye pressing "a". Been there, done that))) guilty.

Falling off a kelethin flat after the run from kaladim? sigh run again. :p

Putting 10 points into intelligence of your dwarven cleric at creation,
since you wanted to be a smith and you read on an outdated website wis AND
int are important fro tardeskills.

Falling for 10K (now 20K) damage just because you run in DL from tunnel
towards KC on levvi and dont see that its fading.

Not checking if the right spells are where they should be when logging on.
Your GF used your cleric to rez some friends and loaded gate into your CH
slot. You come into a group, begin to fight, you hit your CH hotkey and
........... VERY EMBARRASSING!!!!!!

In NrO i was attacked at LvL9 by a MEAN playerkiller. I asked him to stop
and cursed him in /ooc after he killed me. HA! I really destroyed the
reputation of that D`vinn!!!! /blush /hide

As i always say. Every start has its problems and u live to learn. :p
