Since I could have never anticipated that I'd be called on it, I obviously didn't
save any logs.  And since memory is never 100% accurate (particularly in my case)
I'll own up to the possibility that I'm remembering it incorrectly.  However, I seem
to distinctly recall sharing with my group mates the hilarious text lines saying,
"You have no idea which direction your facing." followed by, "You've become better at
sense heading! (67)"
  It was equally as funny as my monk attempting to bandage himself, nearly killing
himself with a disastrous failure, and getting a skill increase on bind wounds.
  From the other side of the coin, I would submit that it's nearly always impossible
to prove a negative, so the fact that you never saw it (or perhaps "noticed" it would
be better?) in x number of levels isn't really prooof. As to Verant saying it
doesn't? Well, we all know that history. Plus, things change. Perhaps it used to but
doesn't now, or vice versa? Tough call.
