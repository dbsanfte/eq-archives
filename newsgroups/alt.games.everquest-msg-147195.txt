Clipped from a post from Wrinkly
<<I'm an IT professional and I've been using the internet long enough
to have an icq # 1266360.>>

I can't remember my ICQ number but that made me laugh.  If you want to
know why, it's because I realized that my MCP number after my firsrt
exam was 162.

Anyone else care to disclose thier ancient self?
