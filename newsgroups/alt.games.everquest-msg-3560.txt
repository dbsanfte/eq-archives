eITHER oops caps lock and I hate deleting what I write so i'll just leave it
here. k? =)
Either way, if everyone in the group rolled like he did, everyone had the
same chances to win the item....
I have gotten 0's on rolls before, 100's as well... I've won an item in a
full group before with a 5.... I've seen it all... *sigh*
Oh then I saw this stupid moron in a 4 person group, an SMR dropped shortly
after he joined up and everyone rolled 100's and my friend got an 84, and
this guy rolled 0-99.... I dont see how he could have accidentally typed 99
instead of 100....... anywyas, he got a roll in the upper 90's and he didnt
wanna re-roll because it was almost the same chances to win and he couldnt
accept the face that he had slightly better chances to win and he finally
re-rolled and lost then was all shitty about it... *shrug*
thats low
anyways... why am i typing this? oh well at least you heard a funny story!
and great times will be had by all and we can all dance in circles in our
underwear while eating a double whopper with no veggies cause im an
anti-vegetarian with like most veggies except ketchup! but tomatoes suck
unless theyre ketchup. Damn I need to sleep. and eat. which should I do
first? if I sleep i would be slowly digesting food and ive been starving
since.... wow 15 hours now, maybe I should eat.... but i dont feel like
eating anything... oh no what if ive turned into an anorexic person... you
know this is wierd im watching a game on tv letting my fingers do all the
typing hahaha ok illlook at the monitor now cause i dont know how to send
without mouse
