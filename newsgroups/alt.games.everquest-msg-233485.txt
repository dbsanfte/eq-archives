d'oh!!!!!!  replied to sender instead of to group ;( trying again, sorry
SESrin!

If the necro is level 12, he can heal himself just fine - he just got a
lifetap over time spell that rocks at that level.  Of course, if he's about
to die, throw him a heal ;)

Where were his 'adds' coming from? was he the puller? or was he trying to
solo mobs while the ranger tanked others?

With just the three of you, you've pretty much gotta stick with 1 mob at a
time.... when the adds build up I'd say get the hell out and try again.

In a perfect situation, you only need to heal the tank.  Should a caster get
whacked occasionally, throw a heal over time on them (when you get one).  If
said caster is a druid, shammy, or necro, let em heal themselves.  Other
melees that can't heal themselves, help em out, but if only the tank is
getting whacked, it isn't too big of a priority.  MA stays alive = group
staying alive.

and btw.... when your mana runs out, it shouldn't be 'melee time', but
rather 'med time' to get mana back ;)
