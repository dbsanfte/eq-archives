No, if first name or surname alone is a common real name, it's okay
since it can be reasonably argued that there was no intent to copy any
real character or celebrety/etc. If it's a name/surname combination
that's a match (altered spelling or not) for a character from a
recognizable source (recognizable is GM discretion) or a
celebrety/historical figure/political figure/etc, then it's not okay.
The closer the match to a character/real figure the name is, the "less
okay" it is.

Because Deedlit was a name created uniquely for the anime in which the
character is featured. It originated with the anime. Just like the
name Drizzt originated with RAS's books and Gandalf originated with
JRRT's books. There's no "common real name" defense in these cases.
