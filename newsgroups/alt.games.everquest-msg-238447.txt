Funnily enough, this is what caused us to wipe the first time we tried him
(just five of us), didnt have the dps to kill him before he wiped us.
Second time we invised, got in place, enchanter took first DT, he drop we
disc (rogue / ranger / warrior), shaman dotted like mad, boss and shaman
died at the same time.

He deathtouchs from quite far away also.

Another thing is sometimes sirran can spawn too high in the air to hand in,
you can petition, which could take a while, or get someone to aggro him
(rogue with escape is good to save time rebuffing), and drag him down.  He
hits for about 2k btw :p
