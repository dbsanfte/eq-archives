I have come to the conclusion that my 15 Barb rogue is an idiot. I am going
to creat a higher int rogue for skill learning and for
smithing/poison/pottery and perhaps basket weaveing ;)

I am thinking about a DE or Half Elf rogue, I like the HE rogue because they
seem well rounded where DE seems a bit weak.

I am more conserned with  _base_  str then dex/ag and want any race advice
you may have...not just people screeming Gnomish power!!! ;)

Thanks,
Sesan 15 barb rogue (soon to die)
