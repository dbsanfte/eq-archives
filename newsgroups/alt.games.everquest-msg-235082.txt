We've all had 'em; share your story here!

Here's mine from last night:

I'm looking for a group on my mage and having no luck when I see a /ooc for
more in a low-40s group.  I send a tell asking if they want a 43 ranger and
they readily agree, so I get my ranger online and run him over.

Group is looking good - ranger, warrior, cleric, shaman, bard, rogue.  What
more could I want?  Then I /con the others - all blue.  The warrior is 36,
the cleric is 39 - I'm highest by a wide margin. The warrior and I compare
HP and AC; it's pretty close so we decide to let him tank to get his damage
mitigation.  We wait a bit for the shaman and bard; they have to get their
adventure stones.  (First clue)  I ask if this is their first LDON, they
confirm that it is.

We've got our adventure and are trucking over to Lfay when the bard asks
where it is.  The Lesser Faydark zone.  (Second clue)  We say it's off Gfay,
the bard has to ask where that is, too.  I tell him to follow the path from
the adventure camp to the east, zone over, then follow THAT path taking all
right turns.  Bard is the last person to zone in, instead of the first.

Now that we're all in Lfay, we're going to head to the adventure zone.
Where is that?  Bring up your compass and follow the blue line.  (Third
clue) How do I bring up the compass?  Alt D, Mr. Bard.  I con him again;
he's blue, not green.  /sigh  The warrior asks who's pulling, and folks all
pipe up 'The Bard' of course.  Except me.

I send the bard a /tell, "This is your first LDON, right?  Have you ever
Lull pulled before?"  "How do I do that?"  I take a second to send a tell to
the group leader, "Where did you FIND this guy?" and proceed to start trying
to tell the bard how to lull pull, in /tells to try to preserve his ego.
He's not getting it; I confer with the cleric and decide I'll pull with
lulls on assist from the cleric as required.  I tell the group this is to
take advantage of my level, higher level means lower aggro footprint so I'm
less likely to get adds.  Our cleric agrees, this will be important on a
Hard adventure.  Hard?  Alt-V and I curse like a sailor.  Two people in
their first LDON and the group leader (the cleric) gets a Hard adventure.

The cleric pipes up, "Ok, all the bard has to do is melee and CC."  Our bard
asks, 'What's CC?' and I have to backspace over /q, I already had it typed.
I send the bard a /tell, asking if he's ever used mezz song to stop adds.
He's thinking he's supposed to offtank adds, and when I mention mezzing he
asks me what song to use.  Backspace over /q again, I'm typing it without
thinking now.

I'm done catering to this guy's ego and say in group that I'll rootpark for
CC, since the bard has no clue how to do it.  Bardboy gets all offended;
I've always chant-kited for XP and it's always worked fine for me!  I don't
bother to explain that in an LDON there's no room to chantkite, I just say
that if he tries to chantkite in there he'll kill himself and everyone else
very fast, just assist the warrior and fight your best.

We zone in, I pull the first mob no problem.  We've got it about half down
when I notice the bard's health bar is dark red - instead of using /assist,
he tried to click to target and (as happens often in front of the door) he
zoned out.  /sigh

Someone else must have been sending the bard tells, because instead of
zoning back in, he just leaves the group.  The cleric sends tells to try to
get him back - the bard was the group's only mana regen - but bardboy is
gone for good.  He does one thing I approve of; he didn't just leave the
group, he left the adventure as well.   (BTW, who was it in another thread
that said people who exclusively solo do fine in groups?)

The rest of the problems aren't really any one person's fault - sure, the
warrior couldn't get aggro off of me even when I switched to a slow 2hander,
and the cleric and shaman both started running laps around the room when
they got aggro (good thing I was snaring!) - just lots of little things
caused by either being someone's first character or a PL'd character of a
higher level toon.  (Sure, I know how to play a warrior, I have a 62nd level
cleric!)  To my great surprise, we completed the mission with about ten
minutes to spare.  Adventure Points suck at 43, the Hard nets me 10 points
but I got over a yellow and a half of regular XP so I'm not complaining.  I
made a careful note of that bard's name, though; that's one experience I
NEVER want again.

Tcharlee,
43 Bard
