Not sure this has ever been shown to be true... its one of those
things that has always seemed to be a 'feeling' by players.

Or... just simply getting more melee skill checks.

If I recall... and people can chime in here if they've done or have
links to the parsing info to clarify, but missing isn't dependent on
the mob AC.. but instead on the weapon skill. As skill goes up you
miss less. There shouldn't be any fundamental reason why if the mob
has harder armor that you would suddenly miss it more. Hit for the
minimum yes, but not miss more.

As far as i know, Melee weapon skills are tied to DEX. The higher the
dex the faster you bump.
