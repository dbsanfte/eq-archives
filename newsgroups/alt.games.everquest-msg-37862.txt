Ditto.  I suppose it's a lot different for porters and 
rezzers (sp?) but not many people will ask for a SoW 3 
zones away :)  OTOH, I've also learned that I shouldn't 
stand certain places if I want to keep my mana.  
Freeport and G Fay gates/lifts being the obvious 
examples *g*  Idiotically, I started out practicing my 
spells at Freeport so that if I felt like trade-skilling 
for a change (this would be BEFORE the patch, can't 
afford to switch off anymore :() I could, and I ended up 
making a hotkey saying "Sorry, I don't have SoW 
memorized right now."

Lelilali (and another saying "No, I will not sit down 
and memorize it, I'm busy right now." :) )
