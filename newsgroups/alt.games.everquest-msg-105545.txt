Your comment: Do you always assume things like that when you can't get
to a site?

My reply: Do you always take the offensive when someone asks a simple
question?

My reply is not more offensive then your's was.

>You got what was coming to you. Don't cry innocent now.

I asked a question and got my ass jumped. Of course I became
defensive. It's human nature. Unlike my character, I am human.

What? Let me see if I understand you. Trolls that hate EQ will post
something along the lines of either a question/statement that EQ/Sony
was hacked, and it's meant to piss EQ lovers off? How and why would
that piss you off? I like EQ most of the time and think overall it's a
wonderful game, yet can't for the life of me figure out how it would
piss me off if someone said EQ was hacked. I'd simple reply with a no,
it's not.

Perhaps saying that there are secret cheats that all the high level
characters use or perhaps a request for said cheats (which is trolling
for flames from the anti-cheaters) might be useful for trolling. Or
even saying that the Guides take real life money bribes from certain
Guilds. But to simple ask or say that EQ has been hacked is enough to
set off the lovers of EQ? How odd.
