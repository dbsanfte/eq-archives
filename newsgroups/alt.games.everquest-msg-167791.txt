Absolutely agreed. But. I play Counter-Strike and Quake from time-to-time-as
well, and compared to the grandstanding, cheating, hacking and pre-pubescent
smacktalk that goes on there, EQ to me seems like a breath of fresh air.

It sucks to lose equipment, and I know that as well as anyone. But, there
are plenty of ways to avoid it if you really don't want to risk it. And, on
3 of the 4 Zeks, losing items isn't even an issue

Different strokes, I guess...
