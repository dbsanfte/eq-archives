Bind wounds can be used to heal you up to 50 percent health, with the
application of several bandages (could be quite a few).  You cannot bind
wounds during combat, generally.  At high levels, depending on your class,
your bind wounds can heal you up to 70 percent (I think that's the limit),
with AA abilities, you can get to 90 percent (again I think that's the
limit).  With bind wounds, on a success, you heal 1/4 of your bind wounds
skill level in hitpoints.  The nice thing, is it takes no mana to use.
