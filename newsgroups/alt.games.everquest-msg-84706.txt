Heh, you're getting 2 zones combined there.

Marus Seru, other side of Sanctus Seru from Dawnshroud, totally green at 35.

Mons Letalis, south of Grey, also connected to Marus Seru, VERY rough zone,
a lot of chasms and boulders, low visibility and high amounts of wanderers,
but still doable by their group.

My recommendations are Scarlet desert, lots of prime hunting for that group.

Tenebrous Mountains, its the 35-45 newbie zone!  lots of powerful bats and
(sonic) wolves.

Twilight if you don't mind getting a little wet, hehe  (the hidden valley is
full of aliens waiting to be killed, but you *need* EB to get through the
tunnel, 175 swimming won't get you through on a bar of air, and the fish in
the tunnel will agro)

Echo caverns is also nice, either segment, just be careful about the Great
Saprophyte, he's perma rooted, but he's a wizard and will nuke the shit out
of you.  He does drop Remove Curse spell fairly often from what I hear, the
cleric, druid and shaman will probably all want a copy.  =P  Also down there
is Taskmaster Torzakh, who's a level 40 shissar, probably easy kill for you
guys but just warning anyways.
