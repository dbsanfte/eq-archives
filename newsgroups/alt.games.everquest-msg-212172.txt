I definitely agree on the BoC, though it makes a great twink weapon before
it starts to proc.  :)

As far as the rest, perhaps windblade wins for you, at 65, but it definitely
wouldn't for the 53 ranger.  You have, first, the full stats of the
windblade, and second, the full damage bonus for 2h'ers at 65.

And as soon as you put swiftwind into the mix, I'll start showing you
keen edged cleavers and such.  I was talking purely about what one person
could get on their own.

Level restrictions *are* game mechanics issues.  :P

What do you think the ratio on a windblade is at level 53?  The damage bonus
for a level 53?  "There are game mechanics issues involved."

Well, perhaps.  For a level *65* ranger that for some reason hasn't started
raiding (I'm constantly watching 15/21, 14/19, 15/19 weapons rot because the
rangers only care about archery, but I know they drop).

A ranger getting riposted is a fool or is trying to save their group/raid
from a wipe.  Learn to stand where you won't get riposted, cause windblade
or not, there are some mobs where it only takes one.

I'm just gonna ignore the "ranger tanking" comments.  Rangers can tank just
fine when it's absolutely necessary...  once the warrior, shadowknight,
paladin, monk, bard, rogue, beastlord, cleric, wizard and enchanter are dead
that is.  :P

Well ok, probably before the wizard and enchanter.  And I guess before the
cleric, though only cause the cleric can heal and then finish tanking when
the ranger is dead.  :)
