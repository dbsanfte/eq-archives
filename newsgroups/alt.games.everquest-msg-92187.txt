Oy!  20 seconds!?  I use Outlook Express all the time for reading newsgroups.
It never takes that long.  I click on an article and boom... less than half a second
the text is downloaded and displayed there in the viewing pane.

That said, I don't like it when people post in HTML either. I often find that people
who do such things have far more form than content.  And usually the form sucks
too :P
