Continuing the drift.
I'm not sure that I agree with all of Letham's work being fantastic.
I have found him totally inconsistant.
Some of his books are absolutly top rate. (e.g Motherless brooklen)
While some of them seem like the unfinished work of coledge students
(that short story collenction that I don't remember the name of)

I read Letham thanks to a recomendation on this group, but I really wish
that I had a list of his books before I bought them, so that I could
cherry pick the good ones.

I also wish that I had a list here so that I could remember which ones I
liked :-P
