No way that going thru the Karanas, Lake Rathe, Rathe Mountains, Feerott,
Inny Swamp Ro and Oasis are safer than Kithicor in the daytime. Kithicor is
an easy zone. Just wait till 9 am if you are paranoid. BTW, I run thru it at
night if I am SoWed. I stay up high on the zone walls and if I pull any agro
I zone into RV. Been doing it since level 12 without dying. Been hit a few
times, but can always zone.

PS I got great XP there on the orcs. Just zone into Kith from HH and make a
right. I hunt there day and night. The undead don't come over to that area
unless they are trained there. Great Xp 15 to 18. Usually killed there while
waiting for Orc group in HH.
