I am certain of this much, the off hand weapon does not need to swing (note, I
didn't say "Does not need to hit", although that is true too)... does not need
to *swing* to have a weapon proc.

My low level Rogue had a proccing weapon in the off hand, and it was just
after getting dual wield, so the off hand wasn't swinging much.   It was not
hard to watch the swings, and see where the one "you slash" was compared to
all the "you pierce" messages.  In the middle of a string of pierce attempts,
without a slash hit or miss in sight, I got "Your will is insufficient to
wield this weapon".   Even though the off hand had not swung.

I do believe though that they adjust the proc rates based on which hand the
weapon is in.  On weapons that I have used in both hands, I noticed the same
thing that you have.   Procs appear to be much more common when wielded in the
main hand.


Something like Bloodpoint, Proc rate main hand = 10%.   Proc rate off hand =
5%.

Of course, it all depends on what multipliers they used.  And how fast of a
main hand weapon they anticipated.
