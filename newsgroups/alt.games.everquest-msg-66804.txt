i agree with this. however, lag & chop was absurd in the major cities.  did
this ever get fixed?

any game becomes repetitive. however, finding groups in eq seemed a lot
easier, so "kill kill kill, lvl, move on, rinse & repeat" seems to go
faster.

i guess i qualify as a hardcore eq addict. but im always looking for the
next best thing.... unfortunately, daoc just wasnt it... for me at least.  i
imagine there are still 2000+ ppl per server when you look at the server
screen in daoc, so obviously they are doing something right and making lots
of ppl happy.  i guess its just those of us who have been subject to verants
brainwashing that we cannot live without hearing dings and shouting for
ports that cannot get away =)


> ( yah another corpse run into thehole sign me up, now!).

now see, this is what i and some ppl like. yes, if you wanna just run back
to your grave and pray to get exp back and not worry about losing equipment
if you dont make it back, daoc is the choice. but i like the risk &
challenge of going deep down into dungeons... if i had no reason to make it
back to my corpse and just take an exp penalty, all the fun would be gone.
