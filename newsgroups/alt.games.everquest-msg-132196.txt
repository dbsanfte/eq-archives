I'd say you are too low for Karnors, where many of the lesser Cobalt drops.
Gaunts off of Drolvarg Captain and Boots off of Caller of Sathir.
Legs come off VS himself

Arms, Bracers and Helm are from Old sebilis and, again I'd say you are still
too low to get them.
 BP forget it, it's one of Trak's drops, you really need to be 55 to get on
a Trak raid.

For a decent improvement in armour I'd suggest trying the following
Go to Velious and start the Champion armour quests from Thurgardin, you're
guild will need to be raiding Kael for the drops but it's not really out of
your range to start.
Go to Velious and hang around Icewell Keep in the hope that some decides to
kill the Guards there for faction, ask if they'll let you loot any of the
Frosted Velium armour that drops.
Go on Hate raids and see if you can't get any Indocilite drops, I'd make 47
before trying that tho.

Buying improvements will cost a bit so you'll need a few k

Cobalt Gaunts are about 2k Boots 3-4k Arms 5k Bracers 12 - 15k Helm 10k (at
least on Bristlebane)
Crystal Chitin Arms about 3k Barbed Ringmail 4k Dragonleg breaches 6k+
depending on how good.
