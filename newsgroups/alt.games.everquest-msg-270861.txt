Of the 250 odd quests I've either completed or am in the process of doing, 
I've only done external research on about 5 of them.
I've only started I think two quests after reading about them externally. 
Yep, I've had no trouble both in finding quests or completing them at all as 
most of them are reasonably straight forward.

I am honestly suprised at how many people say they hate the EQ2 quest system 
for precisely the reason you indicate.  Yes the quest system has a couple of 
issues, and some quests are broken ... but not many, and almost none of the 
quests have the kind of difficulties you are alluding to.
