I can't directly speak to most of your concerns.  However, your
guildmate may not be losing as much DPS as you might think.  I believe
that hybrid classes, unlike pure int or wis casters, do not have their
swing timer reset by casting a spell.  If a shaman (for example)
swings a speed 20 weapon, then 1.5 seconds later starts casting a
spell, the next weapon swing will happen 2.0 seconds after the spell
completes.  By contrast a hybrid (like a SK) in the same situation
would get to "remember" those earlier 1.5 seconds and get a weapon
swing only 0.5 seconds after completing the spell.  With a
sufficiently slow weapon and fast spell, you might be able to time
your spell so as not to reduce melee DPS at all.

I've never actually parsed this or have any reason to believe it than
having once read it somewhere.  Can anyone confirm or refute?
