Personally I call that bad quest design myself. Followed up with a
half ass solution and a pinch of CS, "Your screwed", when people
innocently attempt to ensure their faction is high enough so they will
get Rak to agro after tear turn in. Because if you have done fear, you
know it's tough enough to get that tear. Also, everything I used to
read about Rak prior to this was how some people seemed to fall short
of faction and yes, Sony has been training us to believe there is no
such thing as too much good faction; well, until now....

There in lies the problem. As we have seen, success seems to have
little to do with the intent of the epic quest and just comes down to
a certain faction number given some possible extra points. So I guess
what has really happened is that you can still do the shaman epic
provided you can guess correctly on how many times to do a particular
portion of it and who knows, maybe there is a MoB out there who gives
negative True Spirit faction so you can adjust your faction downwards.
Though like Kirn; I'm sure there is a fear revamp in the works which
is about to make that potion of the epic harder too. But that's a rant
for another post.

My EQ experience has been a mixed bag of good and bad. The bad for me
being things like 16 hours of HoT and nothing to show for the play
time invested and the epic which suffers from poor design and sony
adjusting the "challenge level" more then a year after the fact. Makes
me think rather then go through all this again with "prettier
graphics" in EQ2; it might just be better to retire EQ when I have had
my fill and go play a new MMOG like World of Warcraft.
