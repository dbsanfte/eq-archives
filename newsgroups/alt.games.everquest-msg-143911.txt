    So 4x420 + 4x500 + 992 = 4672 damage. With Focus, yeah, I could take it.
Too bad I always click off Focus. ;-)

    A Rumblecrush or two ago, the rampage tank thought it would be cute to
run out of range and see who was next on rampage. I took 4364 damage from
two rounds of attacks, got off DA, walked waaaaaay away from the fight,
CH'ed myself, then came back and kept the now-returned rampage tank alive
for the remainder of the fight. We clerics are tough little buggers!
