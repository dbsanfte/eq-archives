Heh, a "knight in shining armor" is the last characterization I would ever 
apply to Brad. I just think he wasn't afraid to be tough and he spoke his 
mind. That was evident in every post he made here (remember the "bottom 
feeders" comment)?

I have a hard time imagining why the lawyers would advise against it, 
there's no question about the property issues here. Verant owned the 
intellectual property and licensed use of it. Revocation of that license was 
entirely within their rights based on violations of the TOS. If your 
emphasis is on the word "public", that might have been a reason. No point in 
risking defamation. But that's easily avoided by doing a public banning 
without naming names. You don't have to let the public know who got banned, 
just that someone did for doing X.

I think it's more likely the pressure came on the sales and marketing side. 
Banning accounts of paying customers isn't generally  the best way to 
generate goodwill...
