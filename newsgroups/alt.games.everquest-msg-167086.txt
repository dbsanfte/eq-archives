That's why you stack DoTs.  I toss on my best disease DoT first, then stack
my best poison DoT.  I have to recast the poison DoT several times, and,
yes, reroot.  At level 58, I am not going to melee anything (well, almost
anything) that gives reasonable xp to death.  If I attempted to use melee
instead of DoTs to kill a dark blue mob, I would be dead.  My pup OTOH is
pretty decent at melee.  I still did not use him for soloing in PoP zones at
level 57, as those mobs hit for too much damage for me to keep up.  I may
try him again now that I have my gimp CH.
