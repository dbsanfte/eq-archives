My reason too :) Everybody keeps claiming that Linux is so stable, but for
some reason my Liuxbox had more problems then my Windows 2000 machine. My
lil internet server runs Windows 2000, and is being used as a workstation
too, and has been up since I installed SP2 a few weeks ago. Before that, it
had been running since February, without a single glitch. My main
workstation I usually boot once a week, but thats more because i mess with
installing new programs etc.... My laptop also runs Windows 2000, and of
course that one gets rebooted all the time. I have really no need for Linux,
Windows 2000 is stable enough..... AND it runs my favourite games, like
Everquest!

Shadows of Luclin won't be ported, because its an upgrade to the current
Everquest game series.... were talking 2002 before Verant prolly brings
anything thats really new.

Its my opinion that Linux is a GREAT server platform, especially when you
want to setup Internet-related servers. It simply SUCKS as a decent
workstation platform, because it misses the applications to support a good
business environment, and it truly sucks as a home PC.
