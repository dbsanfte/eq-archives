The only way I know to raise faction with Kelethin Merchants is to
collect shark meat, and give it to Gillian Windwood. Yes, at one point,
you could buy shark meat in Thurgadin. You cannot any more. You'll have
to hunt the sharks yourself in the Ocean of Tears, Freeport Docks, and
other places.

That's a lot of shark meat though.
