What's the most black reavers you've ever seen spawn off a single kill?

Last night our guild, in their endless search for Jade Reavers for
epics, went back to CoM. (Without me, thank god.) They went into the
Reaver area and started pulling as normal. Soon, they pulled down a
black reaver who popped a respawn. Who popped a respawn. Who popped
another. And another. And another.

A few hours later they killed the last one. A rundown using Joe D's log
parser by our lead cleric came up with the tally. Eightyfive. Eightyfive
damned black reavers in a row. Dropped five Jades over the course of the
runk though, which was pretty cool.

I think it had to be a bug of some sort. That's an awful lot of spawns.

taking up tailoring, get a ball peen hammer and whack yourself on the
head every 15 minutes. Over all, it's certainly less painful, and very
probably more productive."
