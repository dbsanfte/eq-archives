Has your wife solo'd the rogue poison quest at 20th lvl? 

Has your paladin done his 'epic' weapon quest in a group of low 20s
lvl characters? ...if you answer yes to that one and still think the
EQ2 dungeons are better and more interesting, that would be a really
good reason for me to go out and buy EQ2. 

I think you're wrong in your assessment that WoW isn't challenging.
From what I've seen, it's as challenging as you want to make it. It's
easy (too easy imo) to solo to 60 if that's what turns you on, not
even bothering with quests and just grinding mobs 1-3 levels lower
than you. That doesn't mean that the challenging content isn't out
there though. People just avoided it. 

Where WoW screwed up is that there really isn't any incentive to do
the challenging stuff at lower levels. Mainly because you can level
past it so quickly if you want. EQ1 had the same problem at the end,
why go to places like Unrest, Mistmoore or ToFS if you can just grind
and level past them in a couple of days? 

From what I gather reading the EQ2 posts here, EQ2 does a better job
of channeling people into the dungeons (some would say forcing you)
and that might well be a better way of doing things.
