Ironicly, the 60 warrior was actually a former member.. he left on good
terms to go join a real life friend guild (very amicably - he still had
board access after leaving).. theres been several incidents recently though
making people see what an asshole he is

Never heard either of those names.. but across the court yard, yes.
At the base of the "temple" (the general area) there was a lil campfire or 2
with mobs around (including level 60's)

Our last fight sounds like yours though, at least 15 mins of solid fighting,
but with just 1 group and an add too many we eventually wiped

Bloodmaw pants (or something similar)?  And they could have negative AC,
unless you have AoW/nToV pants they are a huge HP upgrade

People say that but I never really notice super fast group exp, to be
honest..   A few weeks ago i was off work ill, so I got to log onto EQ
during my daytime (very very late US time).   I was in a Velks zone with 6
people total in the zone (3 of them were me).   By the time I got too hungry
to ignore, I had dinged 3 aa levels in less than 5 hours

Thats why ANY group exp sucks :p    Im generally sharing my solo exp anyway
though, jak and nal need MGB..  shamans at 3 aa levels, clerics at 8aa so
far.. so still some way to go
