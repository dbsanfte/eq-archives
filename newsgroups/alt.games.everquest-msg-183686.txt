i tried trade skills today so i could make armor tints,got my skills
up to over 100 in pottery and brewing then proceded to make  dye i
started with 60 of each component and ended up with 29 useable vials
of dye if this is an example of the success rate i'm surprised anyone
bothers at all, considering what a god awfull boring time is to be had
making stuff as far as i'm concerned they can stick trade skills up
there ass from now on. (and my wis and int were well over 130 too)

TRADE SKILLS SUCK BIG TIME
