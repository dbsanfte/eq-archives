Aye, but chances of it running the same direction as you aren't all that good,
particularly if you look at which way its heading.  And if it DOES catch you,
just keep moving, and you'll lose it again.  It stays blind, its not like using
Atone where once it re aggros you its back on your tail.

There are a couple spots where thats true, but in most of SG theres sufficient
room for that not to be a problem.  SG exit is indeed one of those places, and
anyway if you can run away there you can zone blind or no blind.  I was
discussing the more open theory of "get it off me" strategies, though, not the
specific "get it off me at the SG succor spot" ones.  At the succor spot,
looking for a "get it off me" strategy is like trying to explain sex to a virgin
with a perfectly good bed handy.

Oddly Blinding Luminescence is resisted a lot more than Flash of Light.  I
hardly have any use for BL because of this, it costs more, gets resisted more,
takes longer to cast... and worst of all, lasts longer!  I know that last sounds
odd, but when I used to do my flashdance "blind and nuke" soloing, the short
duration of flash compared to fear was part and parcel of the plan.

I'm not suggesting its useless, just that it isn't a good "get it off me" tool.
If someone has low HP aggro, you really can't be spending 5 seconds getting a
mob off them, unless the mob is such a joke that another plan comes to mind:
melee it to death!

Yes, but I mean can you root a mob and then get close enough for prox aggro to
get it off a low HP aggro person (one which is perhaps stunned or rooted so he
can't move out of the rooted mob's melee range)

Sounds like something along the lines of ID as far as likeliness of success.
