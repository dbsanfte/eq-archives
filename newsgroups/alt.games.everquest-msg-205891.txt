One thing to keep in mind is that it's not moving that the server checks
for.  What the server checks is that your position at the end of casting is
the same as your position at the start of casting (x and y only).  If you
start to cast a spell, move, and then move back before the spell finishes,
the spell still works.

There's one exception to this that I know of: boats.  If you start casting a
spell, and then move onto a boat, the spell finishes OK on the boat, even
though you aren't anywhere near your starting location.
