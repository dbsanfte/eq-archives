I know its old hat to the FV elite, and its useless to the rest of you.

But on FV, very few things are no drop; this includes just about 
everything you can purchase from the Adventure Mercants at LDoN camps.

LDoN comes in 5 mission types, and while you accumulate points for any 
type, you also raise your spending limit in the mission type you just 
succeded on by the same amount.

This means that if you spread around your LDoN mission types, you can 
easily accumulate up to 5 times as many points as you have spending 
limit in any given type.

OR you can concentrate; do only a single type of mission, in which case 
your spending limit and points are the same till you actually spend points.

Well, I'm not that kind of player, I like variety, I like to support my 
friends whereever they want to go, and I'm open to group offers from 
just about anyone (the just about part being my ignore list full of 
"never group with him again" people.  Its a short list)

BUT I've been advised that a certain item in the Takish LDoN dungeon is 
very worth getting, even if I expect to soon reach 65 and perhaps start 
getting access to some pretty decent gear.

It costs 760 points.  I have 768 points unspent.  BUT I have a spending 
limit of 314 points in Takish.

Enter the workaround.  I have an old friend (from when I was 30!) who it 
turns out has a 1224 limit in takish.  SO, I go to BB, pick up two non 
lore augments costing me 340 points each (each my spending limit, or 
close to it), then to NRo where I get a 40 point one, whereupon I'm 
stuck, can't find one thats only 20 points and non lore.  But there's 
one in SRo which my friend doesn't already have which costs 20 points. 
So I get that one too.

Give all the augments to my friend, who turns them in to a guy in SRo 
who gives him "back" their value in LDoN points.

We Magus to NRo, he gets my item from the adventure merchant, hands it 
over to me, and I'm one happy mage!

Diamond Prism of Companionship, no more summoning armor for my pets, 
pets will be one level higher, apparantly works on pets up to and 
including the level 65 one should I ever get it.

With this workaround available, I can continue my wayward ways of doing 
whatever LDoN I like, all points being more or less the same, or for 
that matter I can blow off LDoN and do whatever I like for exp, since I 
already have the main LDoN Item I wanted (not that getting some FT items 
wouldn't be appreciated)
