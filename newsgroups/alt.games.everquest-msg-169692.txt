Dear BoomiBC:

This is just a general comment and is not intended as a slam, but
rather as constructive feedback.  Your posts are difficult to
read.  The use of single letter replacements for words is
understandable, but in your case has become so pervasive that the
result is so difficult to decipher that it is no longer worth the
effort.   I know you may not care what I think, and if that's the
case then please move on to the next message and forget I exist.
But I speak out only in an effort to ask you to please make your
posts easier to read because the content appears valuable.

PD
