Clerics, of course, are healers extrodinaire, but in the absense of a
cleric, a shaman or druid is almost as good, up to about level 34. Often, I
have been the only healer in a group and so that is where ALL my mana went.
By your mid to upper 20's, tanks are getting hit HARD, so every point I had
went to keeping them healed in combat and fixing them back up after battle.
Pray to the deity of your choice that there is an enchanter nearby who can
keep you breezed.

If you have a cleric in the group, she will be the primary healer. This
frees up the druid to do what he does best in groups: buff and damage
shields. At level 26, we have shield of barbs, which does 9 damage when the
person tanking gets hit. It also give a nice AC and HP buff, too and it
stacks with most other shield buffs. It may not do much damage, but every
point means the mob will drop faster and the group will take less hurt.
Strength of Earth will significantly improve the damage done by the tanks,
and Spirit of Wolf... well, lets just say overpulls happen, and you are not
yet able to group port.

Speaking of which, druids in higher level groups should always -- ALWAYS --
keep enough mana on hand to get everyone out quickly. You get your passenger
license at level 29; after that, when you are in a group, keep one of those
circle spells not only memmed, but hot keyed for emergency use.

In groups where a druid is not the primary healer, we also get to use our
nice offensive spells. Creeping Crud is the very blessing of Karana when
your mob is standing still whacking on the tanks, and by now has become
pretty inexpensive to cast (relative to your full mana pool.) Chaotic
Lightning is not bad at all for direct damage.

Druids are pretty good at pulling, too. Although useless in a dungeon
setting, tracking is helpful out of doors for finding mobs. We also have
harmony and snare which allows us to break up camps for the group (as I'm
sure you've done for yourself at lower level.) Until you have played a
soloing warrior gazing forlornly at a full camp of blue and white conned
dervishes, you won't understand how useful those two spells are!

The biggest strength of a druid is that we can do a little bit of
everything. We are generalists who can step in and fill pretty much any role
except tank. Our biggest weakness is that there is always some other class
that can do things better. To function effectively as a grouped druid, you
need to learn how to be a healer, a buffer, a blaster, a dotter, an
evacuator and a puller, because in a group you will find yourself doing
any/all of these things depending on how your group is made up.
