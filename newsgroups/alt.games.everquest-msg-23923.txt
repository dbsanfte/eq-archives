Posting under that screen name was a mistake as bonda was the account i was
using solely for usenet to avoid getting spammed in my main screen name :
boukie. I stood by my original post by reposting under bonda so that all would
know they are one and the same. unaimous derision for the words i used which i
have accepted were thoughtless. If i was intending to troll then i would be
expecting derision, which i wasnt and here in the UK 'poon' or 'poontang' is
not slang for anything, so when i say i was unaware of any other cannotations
the word may carry i was truthfull. I am guilty of a thoughtless post, of
trolling i am not. I have no desire to make enemies in this group and have
enjoyed participating in it but am growing tired of this matter. I made a
mistake, i have apologised, there is nothing more i can say.
