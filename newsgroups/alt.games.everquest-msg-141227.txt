First, you probably saw a ranger killing with arrows.  AFAIK they're the 
only ones that get *really* good skills.  Second, the best way to raise 
any pitiful skill is to find a group killing stuff that's blue/white/red 
to you and ask to up your skill on what they're attacking.  Few groups 
will refuse if you ask politely.  Use the lowest damage possible so you 
don't pull aggro or KS (unlikely, true, but they may get antsy if they 
see any actual damage being done ;)).
