More than that, Sony almost has to do it.  EQ is a MMORPG, and one of the
issues they have to deal with is turnover.   In order to keep the servers
profitable, they need to keep bringing in new subscribers to replace all of
the players that cancel, for whatever reason.

Kind of hard to sell EQ to a gamer who hasn't been playing it all along,
when you tell them the buy in will be around $270... 30 for the orignial
software, and another 30 for each of the 8 expansions.   Oh, and 12 a month
on top of that too, please.   You can buy a low end computer for not much
more than that.

A relatively new version of the game has to remain price competitive with
all of the other software a bored gamer might purchase, if they want to keep
new blood coming in.
