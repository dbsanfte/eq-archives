Sorry if I took offense, but I agree with you completely on that. After 
much introspection since my own indiscretion, I feel extremely confident 
and content that I had not been unreasonably derelict in my duties to my 
guildmates. My determination was further bolstered by confirmation in 
this regard which came from them completely unsolicited.

Make no mistake. It *is* a big deal to me.
