NCSoft can pool support between all the games, same with server hosting
and other expenses. Smaller customer base means smaller number of
support calls and lesser loads on the servers as well. 

Mark Jacobs, president of Mythic, makers of DAoC, wrote on Lum's board
back before DAoC released (actually it wasn't Lum's at that point but nm
that) that he'd worked out the budget so that DAoC would be profitable
at 10k users. Not wildly profitable but all salaries covered, including
ongoing development and maintenance. Needless to say they did quite a
bit better than that but they were prepared to live happily with 10k
users. Incidently, CoH used a licenced graphics engine just like DAoC
did.

A Tale in the Desert has somewhere between 2k and 5k users and is
providing a decent income for it's small support and programming staff.

I think Boutique(sp?) mmogs are the wave of the future. There's probably
a lot less support and other annoyances dealing with small communities
who like your game instead of large communities where half the people
want it to be something it isn't.
