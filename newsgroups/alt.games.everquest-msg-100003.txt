No.  Actually, since they are down to light blue, the young shardwurms are
giving you less than half the experience of the Rygorr Centurions.

Mobs are all different.  Some are weak for thier level, some are strong.  Some
hit softly but have a ton of hit points, others have offence and defense
through the room, but fall over if a wizard sneezes on them.

As far as gaining experience from them, level and zone experience bonus are
the only two things that change the amount.  How hard a time you had killing
it figures in nowhere at all.
