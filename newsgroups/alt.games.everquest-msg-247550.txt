And under Sony rules.. you shouldn't. You should know by now there are
no such things as camps or camp etiquette in EQ, especially when you
do not get xp from the area. You had no right to the area.

This is what is commonly called a kill/steal. If a GM had seen it you
could have been banned. In this situation though.. the GM has to be
right there to have seen it, which is usually.. never. They could have
petitioned.. but at most it puts a warning on your account. On the
flipside.. you'll find if a GM ever ends up getting brought in.. that
they did absolutely nothing wrong and were in the right.

Once again.. there is no such thing as a camp in EQ.. therefore it
cannot be yours.

So.. what.. you figured you'd get on here and tell what you consider a
'cool' story about how you harassed some lowbies in Crushbone?

And it will come back to bite you in the future... you'll push the
wrong people around and they'll get your ass dropkicked because you
don't know how to play the game and think that might makes right.
But.. as it stands the odds of that are very low given the GM
situation.. so stroke your ego while you can bully people, and cry me
a river if/when you get banned.
