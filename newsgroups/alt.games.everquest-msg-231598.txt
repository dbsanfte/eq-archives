With 430,000 subscribers... that's around 5 million bucks a month. 60 
million a year. They used to make ends meet at 9.95 per user.

Internet bandwidth costs are decreasing, wages have been pretty frozen 
the last few years, hardware costs have continued their plunge... yet 
SOE cranked the subscription *up* by 30% a year ago, citing increased 
costs...

WHAT INCREASED COSTS??

SOE is simply gouging for every penny they can get from us. Sure its 
capitalism, and this isn't a necessity so we can stop buying it whenever 
we want... but if it were my game, my company... I'd

Stop trying to sell you EQ2 beta slots, and other software within EQ.
Stop putting key user interface improvements into expansions.
Stop spamming you in game.
Wouldn't force you to look at pre-order screens *each* day we log in. 
(once or twice maybe...)
Put GMs and customer service back into the game.
Set character services like name changes, or character moves at prices 
that reflect the actual cost.

And I'd still make a very handsome profit and I'd have much happier 
customers, fewer people quitting and more people joining.
