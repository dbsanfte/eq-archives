Its 8am, not 10am. I generally stick to the right side wall, like most
people, but I had my Bard (lvl 6 at the time, so I didn't care if he died)
run through the zone to Highpass using Selo's (and his hand drum) once and
to make deliveries to Rivervale on occasion, and had my Warrior walk the
path through there to Highpass and back (during daytime) a couple of times.
Worst things I ever ran into were a Teir'Dal Assassin (level 12 or
so....supposedly. Probably an undercon like all DEs) and a Ghoul. Avoided
the DE, but wiped up the floor with the Ghoul.

Usually there's not much in there than skeletons and bixies, though.
