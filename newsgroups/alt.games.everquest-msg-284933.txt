Yes, when Luclin opens, a whole lot more tinkering options open with it.

Further, it looks like a good many of them will actually be useful, at 
least for other tradeskillers.

Since we have several people in my guild going for the coldain shawl or 
ring, we'll have tradeskillers handy .

Almost as important to me, when Luclin opens the Bazaar will be open; 
that means tradeskill components will be buyable, and tradeskill 
products will be sellable; on Combine the EC tunnel has long since been 
abandoned, and what little sales go on are in the "bazaar" channel 
(bazaar:bazaar) and from roaming vendors who spam the /auction channel 
in whatever zone they happen to be in. The channel is limited to 200 
people, most of whom have it on autojoin and aren't actively trying to 
buy or sell anything, and the spammers are a small population and don't 
seem to do much business.

In practice, then, there is very little trade going on; the economy is 
on pause till Luclin release.
