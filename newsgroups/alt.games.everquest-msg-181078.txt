Never *sell* a GLS! Hand in the GLS to get the Concordance.  Concordance
sells for ~10pp with good charisma. GLS only sells for ~4pp.

Handing in the LS gets you one or the other research volumes. But those
are informational only, like recipe books -- nothing you couldn't get off
the web. And since most folks just sell them immediately anyway, there's
a good chance you could just buy them directly of the DE merchants in
SRo...

Correct, But!

It's lighter than a backpack, and holds Giant items. Ditch the backpack
entirely and use the research book to hold your loot. Excellent container
for holding Rusty Halberds for your pet or Mammoth Tusks for selling.
