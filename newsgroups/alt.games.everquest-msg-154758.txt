I haven't thought this thru completely, but won't it pretty much be irrelevant
how many HP your warrior has, assuming he's at 8500 plus (7500 plus
cushion)... Once you are getting healed for max heal, then the remaining
HP aren't more efficiency, they are just padding.

Hmm, think think think.  10000hp warrior loses 7500 hp gets CHeal,
back to 10K.  Loses 8000hp, gets CHeal, up to 9500, loses 8000,
gets CHeal, up to 9000, loses 7000, gets CHeal , back up to 9500...
hmm, actually I can see where you do end up using more than 7500
with a CHeal chain, because laggy CHeal intervals and chunky damage
will mean sometimes having an interval between heals at less than
max CHeal effect, but at other times going over max effect, so your
heals still have leftover HP to heal up.

You know what this is really going to hurt though?  Druid/cleric team
charmer.  Was fighting in ME last night with a charmed ravenous
beast as MT, slapped an ER on the thing (I got there as it was
about to die, and thats the fast heal I had memmed) and barely
saw its HP bar move at all.  Turns out it had over 9000hp
unbuffed!  Nerf my CHeal down to 7500... well I don't know
many tanks that high up on the uber ladder yet, but its easy
to find pets where I'm about to lose a quarter of my effect!
