OK, this is coming from a Troll shadowknight, who doesn't give a damn about
good faction, and works only to make sure his Troll, Ogre, and DE factions
don't bomb.

I wouldn't bother with Erud's.  As the previous guy said, there's no need to
go that far.  If it's the wisps you're after, there's still the commonlands
to hunt them in. But here's what I will tell you about being an evil
Troll...

I would recommend working to get your DE faction up.  It's very nice having
a friendly city away from home, and DE's are all over the place.  They were
initially apprehensive to me, but got to warmly quickly with the red wine
quest.  Neriak is great because it is a huge city with everything that you
won't find in Grobb or Neriak (like trade skill ingredients, for example).

Some spoilers below...

OK, here's some notable things to know for the travelling Troll.  One of the
great things to find are vendors who will deal with me.  Here are some I've
found, travelling from Akanon to Qeynos:
All vendors and guards in the Feerot like me.
Surprisingly, a lot of NPC's in Rathe are indifferent to me, the exception
being the paladins and the gypsy camps.  The inns are indifferent, and
there's also Troll vendors there.  Necros hate me, and I hate them.
Aviaks will hate you from the start.  Most people aren't used to this.
Frogloks also hate you from the start.  They deserve to be squished.
There's some DE vendors in Sro that will serve you.  Can be dangerous
though.
I haven't found any vendors in Oasis that will deal with me.  I'll call this
a wash from now on.
Nro is a wash.
Freeport is a major wash, except for the underground tunnels.  Also be wary
of the lady on the docks if you want to go on the boat.  I've always used
invisibility to get by this part.
Everything on Faydwin hates you.  I don't know of any vendors that will deal
with you, although I honestly haven't searched thoroughly, I suspect that
there may be some in Lesser Faydark, but that zone has some scary things in
it.  On that note, the dwarven docks are safe, there is nothing in the
immediate area to aggro you- although I've used invis, you could probably
swim to south of all the guards.
Almost all NPCs in the commons hate you, except for the occasional evil NPC
(like Gix).  I also think the vendor in front of Befallen was indifferent to
me.
Now the big problem... how to get to the west?  Forget about going through
Highpass without invis.  And you have to deal with the guards in N Karana if
you go the other way...   I did manage to find a way around this.  You can
swim under the bridge, and then avoid the guards in the water.  If you get
in trouble, you can still zone.
As far as I know though, the only friendly vendors I know of on the west
coast is the Qeynos underground.  I had never been there in a very long time
and seeing all the new specters and necromancers (not to mention all the
player corpses) scared me, but nothing attacked me down there, and I even
wandered through the whole guild.  I even think there's a bank NPC down
there, but I might be mistaken.

Basically, just keep your eyes open, and con everything, and i do mean
everything.  As a Troll, we're fortunate that we don't need to travel too
far to go through all the levels, but...  where's the fun in that?  :)
