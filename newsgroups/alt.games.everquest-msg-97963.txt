I want mostly to make enchanted armor, I appreciate the time, and effort you
made.. I really appreciate the Info too.. I can't see how any armor making
in any class is a waste of time, as I would be able to sell it also..? Won't
I.. unless yer also sayin' unless a human, I can't even make it to begin
with. or elven, or dwarvin? ( so I HAVE  to be the class to make the armor
for that class, and no others will work ? )  I have been doing some reading,
and played a lil Quake while waiting for EQ to come back up. For now I will
look closer at EQ traders corner. and look a little harder I must have
missed the info before.
