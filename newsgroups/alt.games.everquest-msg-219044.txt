This is a beautiful segway into something I've been thinking of
bouncing off a.g.e for quite some time.

Re-casting buffs is such a pain!  :)  (I can hear the sounds of
tiny violins playing for me already...)

It would be oh-so-nifty if there was an alternative.  Wouldn't it
be zippy cool if you could cast a buff and have it last *forever
and ever*......well ok, until you or the target dies, or it gets
clicked off......or the target or caster camps......or it gets
dispelled I guess too.

I started a new paragraph in order to catch those people who don't
bother to read a whole post before starting their flaming!  The
cost of those semi-perma-buffs would be......a shrinking of your
mana pool.  So here is the scenario.

Say you have 100 mana and you cast Kaev's Shimmering Shield on
a target, say the tank in your group.  It increases his health,
AC, maybe regen...whatever, doesn't matter.  Say it costs 50
mana to cast, and you cast it when you mana tank is full, okay
so now you're down to 50 mana.

But....the buff doesn't wear off!  However....there's a price.
Until Kaev dies, or the caster dies, or Kaev camps or clicks
off the shield....your mana pool limit drops to 85.  You have a
semi- permanent 15 point loss in your mana pool, which is a big ole
bummer, but you don't have to refresh that buff!

Ok....stupid idea?  Nifty neato keen idea and I'm elected the
most beautiful and cool a.g.e poster??
