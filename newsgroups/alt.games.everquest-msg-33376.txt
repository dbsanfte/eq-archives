Theme of the rest of the city, meaning?
BTW, you should check out store names in Paineel sometime
(eqtraders.com's supply listings are useful for that)

And what makes you think you are good enough for her, not to mention
capable of owning her instead of the other way around? You should fall
down on your knees with joy if she ever as much as gives you a chunk
of meat as a traveling snack.

Do you remember names? I like Brotherhood of Obsidian, even though
they're having an existential crisis at the moment.

If you're a lowbie and want skills, yes. My warrior has Icetooth's
claws, 11/29 1hs, but she's using her 4/19 bladed thulian claws and
won't go with the hard hitting ones till maybe her 20s. Lots and lots
of low damage hits = more chances for skill raises. 

Incidentally, I want a leafblower one day...
