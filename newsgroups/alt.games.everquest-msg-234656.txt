Im not sure about Northern Wolf Armour, but I did a few of the Freeport Monk
newbie armours quests and was pleasantly suprised by one or two of the
pieces.

e.g.   Sleeves of the Stonehand 4 AC, 5 Sta, 2 Agil.

        Trousers of the Stonehand: 5AC, 4 Sta, 2 Agil.

Yes, I know they are worse than time loot.
Yes, I know they are worse than Ornate/EP/1500 LDoN armour.

I also know that they are about as good as the Kunark monk armour.
(Crescent)

They also give you a focus, something to do, at that level.

I know this doesn't interest many people anymore, because they only want to
get to the high-end game ASAP, but for anyone playing the game as it was
intended originally, these are very nice pieces for the ease by which they
can be obtained.
