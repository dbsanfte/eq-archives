Because every slot I have has space for augments. For someone who isn't in a
high end raiding guild, augments are a good alternative. Because if I want
to go in a public dungeon now, either i face endless bitching and trains (eg
DSP) or I face a situation where my corpse could be hard to recover from (no
nice corpse pops like in ldon). Because someone who goes through ldon gets a
progression in points, even if they die, most of the time. Because someone
who goes through LDON gets an increase on the charm augment, whereas soloing
means my charm slot is fallow. Lots of reasons!

Besides, it doesn't have to be 'my own personal dungeon'. What about
something for a 2-3 person group? I've seen lots of low level (21+) people
hollering lfa unsuccessfully because it seems to be unfashionable until your
30's or it requires healer/slower/tank/other people to get the full group xp
bonus.

My shaman gets nagged for adventures when he's afk, muling in the bazaar. I
think I'll play him to get the hang of the layout of the places and the
tactics needed. Meanwhilst I'll leave 'confidence in my abilities' to other
people. Heck, druids can't even agree that DSing the tank is a mana efficent
way to cause damage, or that elysian gear is worth the camping time, or that
a bunch of other spells are worth having in your spell book even.
