    One of the things I love about this newsgroup is that a level 13
character posts a whine about something that will shortly stop bothering
them from under the heap of other worries and we all jump in with our time
and effort, willing to do battle with words to ensure the right information
is given.

    I feel it's indicative of... something.

Cheers,
James
