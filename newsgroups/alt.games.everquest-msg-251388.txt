I cant help you with the split problem,but think only 1 mob
in HoH would cause you a lot of problems,they have 25k hps
and hit for 550.
If you are unlucky and get a full round of hits,that is more
than 2k hps damage,and there is the danger that they love
to stun a lot too,which will make you get hit again.
So you should  *never* get in melee range of them as a
mage,once can be enough to die.
I would look out for some easier targets.
