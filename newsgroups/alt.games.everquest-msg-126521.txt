Exodus 22:18 - "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."

Thanks to that line in the Bible, so many innocent women have gone through
tremendous torment at the hands of corrupted people.

The basic premise was that they had to run a test to determine if the
suspect was actually a witch. If the test failed, and the accused was
killed, they shrugged it off callously as 'We sent someone into God's loving
embrace' - even if it was extremely cruel and excruciating. If it was
successful, and the accused lived, they found some other way to kill her.

Of course, their own Bible also says in Exodus 20:13 "Thou shalt not kill."

Don't you just love corruption and selective worship?
