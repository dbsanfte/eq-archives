John,

	First let me say I NEVER post to newsgoups. I felt this was
important enough though. My friend has the same card you do, it has an
S3 video chip right?
	He is having the same problems. We spoke to a GM last night,
as it turns out support for he S3 was removed. You of course can still
run in in small window but we all know that stinks. My only suggestion
at this point is grab a new card. You can still find the NVIDIA TNT's
around, which are now fairly cheap.
	I know it is not what you want to hear, but let's face it,
it's an OLD card. They aren't even writting fresh drivers for it. I
know I wouldn't want to wait for Verant to POSSIBLEY decide to add
support. 

If you wish to contact me, remove the nospam from below.
