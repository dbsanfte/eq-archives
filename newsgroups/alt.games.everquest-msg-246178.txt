As there is no newsgroup yet for CoH, I'll just leave this one mesage
inviting members of the EverQuest community who wish to join other EQ
players in City of Heros. Any EQ players wishing to meet some of the other
EQ players in game, come to the Protector server.

You can send tells in game with a slightly different format:  /tell
playername, message. Note that the comma is required. Type /friend
playername to add someone to your friends list and then /fl to view your
friends list. Oddly enough, you can also speak into your friends channel by
preceding chat with /f, but the odd thing is that only those people
appearing on your friends list will hear the conversation so, depending on
how the friend network is distributed, some people will be hearing some
one-sided conversations.
