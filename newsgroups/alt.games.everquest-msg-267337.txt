I understand what you're saying completely, and I'm one of those people who 
you consider are "ruining your neighborhood".

But from what I've seen, it's the EQ "1" posts that need to be labeled--or 
hell, maybe *both* need to be labeled for the time being.

At any rate, I don't necessarily think the knee-jerk creation of an EQ2 
group is a wise thing to do.  Down the road (and probably sooner than the 
"old timers" would like to admit), it stands to unnecessarily confuse 
newcomers and unnecessarily segregate two communities who will probably all 
be playing EQ2 anyway.
