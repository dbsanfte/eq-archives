    Changing pathing is a big thing. For one thing, you need to download the 
zone files again to patch in the changes. To give you some idea how 
reluctant they are to change pathing unless truly necessary: I once reported 
some "dead pathing" spots in Marus Seru. Those are spots where, if you stand 
on them, the mobs freeze in place because there's no path to the player. The 
GM that responded told me, after dealing with the people who were using the 
spot, that it was unlikely to change since changing pathing was such a 
difficult thing. If a dead pathing spot isn't a high priority to change, 
wonky pathing is unlikely to ever be fixed.
