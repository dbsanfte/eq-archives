That's a sweet group for howling stones.  Zone in and mes the first 2
skellies that will jump you, and then kill them.  Then invis and levitate
and drop down to the basement.  Clear this area out until you get a key.
Jump on the teleporter that is right in front of you and you will be zapped
back up to the zone in spot.  Be ready to kill those two skellies as they
will most likely be spawned again.  After that clear the golems out that are
blocking your door that the key will work on.  Sorry but I have NO clue what
wing this is off the top of my head.  Maybe someone else can fill you in.
Once you find what wing is the first and easiest wing, duel someone in your
party that has the key and leave a corpse in front of the door, so you can
come back the next day if you like it and not have to camp the key.  Anyway
at the level you guys are at I'd suggest sticking to that first level.

It's definitely a fun dungeon and well designed.  You don't see too many
people there usually either.  Oh and the lvl 51 Paladin should have no
problem with any of those mobs in the first wing once the shaman slows them.
