  We have not done any Elemental gods this year.
  Last year, before the population crash and server merge, waaay before
I could join, Saviours went all the way through the planes and killed Quarm.
Most of that crew retired or moved en masse to EQ2. The few who stayed
became officers.
  This year's lineup, collected across the year, has planar flags like Swiss 
cheese.
Some, espescially recent recruits, got Time flagged in earlier guilds. Some
got keyed in Phase 3 piggybacking on another guild's raids in August.
All told, this gave us about three groups of Time-capable people when
we started trying Time a couple of months ago.
  Just now, we feel much pressure to finish keying everyone. Once that's 
done
we can revisit some lower planes and try to get everyone Elemental access
to increase the number of available targets and potential amount of gear 
drops.
  Sunday, I took an opportunity to join an open Fennin Ro raid. It was a
comedy of errors, twenty or so flagged people fighting our way to Fennin,
twenty more unflagged waiting outside, monitoring the raid channel from 
alts,
waiting for Fennin to go down. We wiped with him at 5%. As it was 3 AM
at that point, eight hours after I had joined, I had to log, and I take it 
so did
most everyone else.
  Saviours won't be able to do Fennin until we get several other mobs down.
Our most glaring lack right now is Tactics access; a disheartening number of
us lack it, and weren't able to take part in the open RZ raid a few weeks 
ago
that made Elemental farming an option for us now. To clean up our flags will
likely mean at least one Behemoth raid, one RZtW kill, and Solusek. I
guess we have our work cut out for us...
