"We port back to PoK, Then I get handed 136pp.  I gratefully accept but am
 left stymied thinking that it's still 64pp short of their initial offer."

This is why you get payment up front.  I don't do the service before
receiving payment.

if I'm in a good mood, I'll do it no charge of my own accord, but if somone
offers to pay for my services, they better do it up front.
