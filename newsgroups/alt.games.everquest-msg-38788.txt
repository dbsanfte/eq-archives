Not only did the original goblins keep their aggro, which increases their
aggro range, but they pass that aggro on to every other goblin they pass,
since they're social type mobs.  Given enough time, you might have had half
of the LOIO goblin population after ya :)  Always zone to clear aggro if you
don't kill a mob that has aggroed you.
