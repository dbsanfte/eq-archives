You might have better luck if you try to convince your guild to go after
Nortlav the Scalekeeper in the Hole.   The Red scale isn't really all that
hard, and he appears to be much less contested than the Naggy scale.  (And
much more killable for us, since more than half of our members don't have a
character in the correct range to go after Naggy.)

The Hand of the Maestro is trivial.   Our guild has only had one Hate raid
where a hand did not drop, since the Maestro wasn't up that time.   (The
confusion is due to the fact that when the Warrior epic first went in, the
Hand was a super rare drop.  It has been changed to a 100% drop since then.)

While the Sky raid and the Queen of Chardok are a major pain as well, the
worst part appears to be killing Severillious for the green scale.   Not just
because you have to kill a hard dragon... not just because the scale doesn't
drop every time.   Because he is a rare spawn (every 3 days? week?) in an open
zone, with huge competion, and basicly uncampable.  Every time he spawns it's
a race to see who can get enough forces to take him down and get the green
scale.

Putting green scales on a dragon in Veeshan's Peak to help alleviate the
bottleneck is a fucking joke.

And the worst part is that the warrior epics aren't that great.  A *lot* of
things dropping in velious put them completely to shame.   No haste on either
one, no armor class on either one  no super incredible ratio, no super useful
proc...
