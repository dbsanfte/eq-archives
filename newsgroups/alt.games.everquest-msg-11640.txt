The first day, especially if you pick a blind race, does suck.

It becomes fun once you start to know your way around but yeah, first day
really sucks...it's getting to know the basics that are a bitch, after that
you just have to figure out how to stay alive.

Now that you've played an hour or two on the live server run the tutorial
again...it'll fill in some holes.
