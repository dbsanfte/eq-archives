My usual gaming companion got to try it out.

Apparently it was a result of the attempt to fix some Z-axis problems
with archery. When on the same Z level as the target, archery was
unchanged, but when on a drastically different Z level (above or
below) the error came into play.

It allowed you to fire arrows as fast as you could hit the key. No
delay, at all, between shots. Also, the range was screwed up -
essentially if you could see a target, no matter how far away it was,
you could hit it.
