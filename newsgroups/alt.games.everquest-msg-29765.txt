I agree with you, generally.  The problem here was, she had done JUST enough
to insure that she would get the exp... hence my immediate reluctance to do
her work for her.

If she hasn't kitted it enough to make sure she gets the exp, and parks it
near me... or drags it over me with enough string that it stops to hit me
(even once)... I blast the ever living snot out of it.

You have increased your skill in KILL STEALING (606).
