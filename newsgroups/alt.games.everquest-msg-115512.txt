Oh you are SO talking bullshit. I guess you havent done many Vox
raids; the way they work is like this:

Raid is scheduled for 6:pm.

At 4:30-5:00pm the druid starts working for the raid , 
porting folks and guiding people who find instructions
like "surefall, to blackburrow, to everfrost, to permafrost,
follow the wall in everfrost (etc)" too complicated.

At 6:30pm the druid finally says "Anyone later than this
can freaking walk" as he's STILL porting stragglers.

From 6:30-6:45/7pm (Vox raids are rarely run by people
practiced in fast raid buffing) the druid works his ass
off trying to buff folks while everyone else chatters,
kills ice giants, AFK's, watches TV, etc.

7pm - 7:15pm the fight starts. Maybe.

Ok, at this point, your druid has already done far far more
work than anyone else on the raid.

If people havent provided for their own transport, and the
raid leader hasnt sorted it for them the druid is under no 
obligation to spend yet *more* time sorting your shit out for 
you.

As a warrior with your rusty longsword, you expect what, to
turn up at 5:45, get a port there, read a book while you get
buffed and chat to youir friends, fight, roll on some loots,
maybe get a phat prize and then be ported out to where you
want to go?

That'd be *nice* but with one druid for everyone to get that
service you're turning him into your personal port bitch
at the expense of *his* playtime. Because he's a druid he
should work four times as hard as the nominal warrior?

Bullhookey.

The warrior,as everyone else, should either provide for 
himself or ensure the raid leader has. It is not the
responsibility of a random stranger to make up for your lack
of preparation. It might be NICE when they do, but hey, its
still your problem to solve.
