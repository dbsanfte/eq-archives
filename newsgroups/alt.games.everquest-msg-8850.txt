You will not evade me, jasonft@visi.com (Jason T):

How about a druid in an AE group? :)

Shouldn't a druid be allowed to pop a stun or nuke if at full mana and
doing so would be appropriate?
(Yes, I am sure you're referring to the druids that burn burn burn oom
and not this :) )

through that mazelike area in Everfrost and Halas is through a dark
tunnel. Happy hunting!"
I've seriously given directions to the Kelethin bank via /tells - and
gotten the person there.

I know of a level 36 twit and a level 52 twit, among others. I use
their presence in their respective guilds to lower my opinion of their
guilds (in the case of the level 36, I found out he was in <morons
united> 2 days after other people's actions convinced me the guild
was indeed <morons united>. Kinda fitting, I thought :) )

I've never had a nasty beggar encounter. I had that twit wanting to
buy gear off my wrists the other day, but other than that, I've only
met people asking me for advice on what kind of gear to buy for
themselves.

It's better than handing it to the PoD. Hand it out to a
not-quite-newbie, make a small quest of it, try to find someone worthy
of the gear upgrade and tell them not to use it before level 6...

>>11. Never join a pick-up plane raid.

I presume that guildraids with guests don't sort under the true pickup
raid category?

Always talk to the NPC first. Doing that saved me from wasting a gem
and not getting crafted gauntlets once.

Only people I know RL who play the game are on other servers. But
there is a couple in my guild who got married (IRL) after they met in
game :)
