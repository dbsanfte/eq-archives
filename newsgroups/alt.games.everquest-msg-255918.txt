The ring Heili drops is nice too, 30fr and extended enhancement IV for 
healer types.  Friends 1st lvl bst got the 30/30 2hb off Tybog, the 
named kobold that is random pop anywhere in Heili's area and the rooms 
up to the first goo's from that side.  Tybog also drops the firewalkers 
shawl which sells for a few k generally.

I just love solc as a loot gathering zone.  It's almost always empty. 
There's a large number of random nameds that drop nice stuff.  The named 
FG drops a tradable 40ac plate bp with 12mr 12fr.  The named goblin 
drops rare no drop shoulders with 15dr and 15pr which my cleric still 
wears.  Monk friend upgraded from those to a drop from HoH trial.

There's a named demon guy that drops nice arms, hps, mana and 15stam 
most notably.  Sold my last pair for 10999pp :)

Guess SolC is tied with Sirens, DN, and Drunder as my fav zones :)

finally an epic Archon lol
