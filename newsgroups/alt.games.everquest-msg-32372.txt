    But "/who thisname all" presents even annonymous instances of the
filter.
    Without having the source code, I wouldn't make the suppositions that
you're making.  You suggest that there are (essentially) two /who
databases... one for each zone, and one for who's online-generally.  Okay, I
have seen traffic and network activity that supports this as a possibility.
But I've also seen responses which contradict the notion (/who friend all
... where the friend is online, but zoning... they don't show up).
    But, let us think about it this way:
    Since new code would be needed to institute a /who ZONE command, could
you not simply query the "who's online-general" database (which DOES contain
zone information) for entries which contain the zone name in question?
    This would not only not differ from a /who all in terms of server load,
it would not differ from a /who all in coding, except to look at a different
field (or part of the string) much like a /who GUILD all.
    Granted, assuming that it is two seperate active databases, or even if
it is only two ways of looking at the databases, the /who ZONE all command I
have described here would not show annonymous instances.  But it would still
be possible, and better than what we have now if we want to try to determine
the make up of people in a given zone.

    An interesting note in terms of storing /who information... when you're
link dead sometime, do a /who (not a /who all, just list the people in the
zone you're in).  It will instantly give you the list the way it was at the
moment you went linkdead.
