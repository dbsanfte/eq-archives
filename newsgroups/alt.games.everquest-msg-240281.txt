What I was saying is that Sony seems to be changing everything (zones, gear,
quests, etc., generalizing) and they are aware that it is annoying people,
and NOW all of a sudden they want to try to get people to sign up long
term...yeah its cheaper, no they aren't persuading anyone at all into
signing up, I was saying they are gearing an option to have some NooB sign
up long term because he's read something "cool" about EQ and when he truely
does join he is screwed and doesn't like it, but guess what now hes locked
in for a year.......IT WAS AN OPINION POST ONLY!!! Relax.............
