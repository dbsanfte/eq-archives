Well, there are necessary risks to take.  If I'm going to have a job, I'm 
pretty much going to -have- to risk getting out of bed, leaving the 
house, driving on a moron-infested freeway, etc.  Given the history of 
bugginess and the fact that there -are- other ways to acomplish exactly 
the same goal, I don't think ActiveX constitutes a necessary risk.

It -is- a small risk, granted, but not entirely negligible, and they're 
asking a large number of people to take it.  (Not entirely negligible) * 
(a large number) = significant.  And a significant unnecessary risk should 
be eliminated, IMO.
