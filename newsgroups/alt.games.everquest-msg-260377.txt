lol - Mages already had their day, so it won't happen for us.

Think about it - pre-Kunark.

We hunted level 38-40 mobs with 2khp that hit around 100.  
Mage's had a focused fire pet that was level 41, had a 42 or 43
pt DS and 1800ish HP.  Further, we had a 800pt bolt.  I tore
through 49 and 50 in 4 or 4.5 hours each without breaking a sweat -
and that was with me having to do 51% of the damage.
