yes and uh yes i guess...you will most likely only find 1hs weapons, but if
you go to the monk guild you can buy a 1hb for only 3 or so gold and it
isn't that bad a weapon.  As for 2 handed slashing, what class are you,
there are a lot of weapon/armor quests in cab, and I vaguely recall one for
a 2hs.
