That is what I was trying to avoid, I remember the garish blue based
multi-hued monstrosities flitting around everywhere ; )  I don't mind going
plate chest - but only if I take the arms and bracers to plate look at the
same time, looks to goofy and accentuates certain features which is not a
good thing for a bloke playing a female character....   : 0

It was the changes to the NPC spellcasters that really was making me think
twice - running out of stamina is one thing but running out of hit points is
downright inconveniencing. Now with the killer nukes and npc AoE's it seems
having a large pot of HP is the most important thing now.

Aye - Having a "Big Brother" really makes a difference, my pre-Chimp level
30's characters were still in Banded with Onyx Earings and Cutthroat
Insignia rings ; )

I like the helmetless look of the Shissar Head Band and the extra agility
helps to pad out the AC a fair bit. At that price though I could pick one up
anyway if I see it just to see how it looks.

She has an FBSS already - and used it earlier on but since aquiring Charm I
figure AC and a few extra HP helps out more than haste right now. I keep it
in her inventory all the time though and swap it in when needed. I will swap
it out with a BA Girdle from now on instead of the Troll Hide belt though.

Aye - Hero Bracer on the shopping list now.

Stormhammer prices are pretty screwy - I will proberly pay a K for that or
very close to. Too many proffessional merchants force the price up even
though the supply of top notch gear is higher than on other servers from all
the 50+ characters everywhere. I will definately grab these if possible
though.

Thanks for that, I would have neglected the better stringed instrument for
sure, I just overlooked that. Currently wearing Fine Splint Cloak on the
back slot (10ac) so room for improvement there statswise but may be a while
since I don't want to shed any of the AC.
