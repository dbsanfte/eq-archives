> Anybody else have stupid stories they've seen or done?

When i dinged 34 i got my Iceclad port, and since i have never been to velious i
immediately ported there.
Was even lucky enough that the snow derv was busy killing someone else (damn
snow dervs, DIE!!!!!), so i got out of the port area alive. Then spots a snow
derv down at the lake, con blue to me, so decide that it need to die.
Forget to sow myself, and the snow derv resist all attempts to snare or root it,
and kill me, i loose level. get a passing through guild buddy to drag the corpse
over to the ring.
Pay 50pp for port there, since i cant port there myself due to level loss.
Loot my corpse, get attacked by snow derv, my porter helps me, and get attacked
herself, but i manage to root the derv, so we can both get back to WC.

I HATE the snow dervs, apart from my first time, i have never ported to IC
without being attacked by them. Only port guildies there, and only do it if they
play bodyguard for me long enought for me to port away again.
