Actually, you deserve to be bashed, but not for your opinion. It's really
not complicated to follow a usenet thread. Your snippage eliminated both
anything you might have posted, and bizbee's comment, which I was responding
to. I didn't say a word about you or your opinion.

Cut and pasted from my post, please read bizbee's last sentence carefully.
Notice he takes a wild tangent comparing setting your own prices as you see
fit in EQ to price gouging, and suggests that anyone pricing above his idea
of fair is assraping the market. I don't really care if you agree with
bizbee or me, I dont really care about this topic in general, I just thought
his post was kinda ass backwards.

Actually I'd think you were the moron taking it in the ass with a smile on
you face if you were selling at 25 plat while everyone else was selling for
50. There's no true need in EQ, only your want for plat, & the buyer's want
for your wares, and the value of your effort is determined at time of sale,
not at the time the effort's expended. Get the most you can for your effort,
I guarantee the buyer will get the most he can for his money.
