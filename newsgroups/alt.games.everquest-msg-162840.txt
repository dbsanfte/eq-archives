I have a fifth season druid on Seventh Hammer server.  This is a new
character for me as I normally play shamans.  I finally decided to go more
main stream, but anyways.  I am trying to get the druid pine armor.  I think
I have all the pieces for several parts but am having trouble putting it all
together.  Literally, I made the silk thread from the spiderlings of
everfrost, killed the giant rats of Qeynos Hills and found the large bat
furs but when I place them in the curing box and hit combine, I get the
message that these items can not be combined in that container.  I have
follow the directions as close as possible but  I just don't get it.

Any ideas?
