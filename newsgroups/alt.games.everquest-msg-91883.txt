  I feel both ways.  I do like having the variety option, particularly when it
comes to roleplay.  I don't always feel in the mood to roleplay just one type of
character.  In other RPGs I play, I will sometimes create "throwaway",
"alternate" characters who are NPC-like in nature... I don't really try to
advance in level with them, I just socialize and roleplay.  That's not really an
option on FV, unfortunately.

  But I also appreciate that the 1 character limit on FV is probably the single
most important feature of the server's ruleset and I do like the lack of twinks.
