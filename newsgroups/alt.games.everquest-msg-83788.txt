  The others have given you good information regarding the strengths
and weaknesses of the two classes you are considering.  They're both
good soloers, but magicians I find are a little more convenient from
the perspective that they can summon food, drink and weight nullifying
containers, and find it easier to find someplace to sell and buy from
at good prices.  Necromancers just have some really great spells for
keeping up an excellent kill rate and surviving if things go awry.
Which is more welcome in a group really depends on the current
composition of the group, the level and the area.

  One comment on your druid, though.  Level 16-18 are sucky levels for
a druid.  It seems more people come to this group asking for
guidance/advice/help at this level for a druid than any other
class/level combo.  I was one of them.  These levels are really a
relative low point in power for druids.  Things change at level 19
when you get your your nuke and heal upgrades as well as the other
stuff.  So you might want to stick with it a bit longer on that
character to see if you're still tired of playing a druid.  You
haven't really felt the power of the class yet. :)

  Good luck.
