The download gives you the original 3 continents, the original races (no
iksar, Vah-shir, or frogloks) and the original classes (no beastlords). You
will however see them, just can't play them.

For the original EQ, those specs are fine.
For EQ with all the expansions and all the bells and whistles turned on,
that machine would die a horrible death
The good news is you can do EQ with all the expansions and all the bells and
whistles turned off, and it should perform
adequately.
You don't need broadband... couldn't hurt, but not needed. I played for 2
years with a 26.4k connect speed on my 56k modem just fine.
You must have:
Windows 98 or later.
DirectX 8.5 or later.
A DirectX 8.5 compatible video card.
