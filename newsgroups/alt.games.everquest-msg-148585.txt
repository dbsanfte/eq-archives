Since you don't list your equipment its really hard to give
specific advice.

As a high elf, it shouldn't cost you much money or effort to get your Wis to
200,
don't push it past there, concentrate on keeping it there and getting better
AC, mana, HP, resists gear.  Something that would be worth saving up for
would be TBoots, or since MQ prices seem to have plummetted, better yet
an MQ for JBoots.  Being able to outrun mobs outdoors (and for a while after
zoning in, indoors) makes an enormous difference.

One interesting thought would be to do the coldain shawl quests up to
level 3, which gets you a nice range slot item, as well as a start on the
much better 7th and 8th shawls.  Getting the snow griffon eggs at your
level will certainly mean grouping with higher level friends, but as a cleric
higher level friends shouldn't be hard to come by.

Lets see, what else.  Cleric quest bracer from Sol Ro is quite nice.  I'm
still wearing one at 60... I'm a bit gimpy, but it isn't a total joke.
Adamantine
Epolettes are easily acquired in LGuk (drop off the ghoul cavalier) and will
last quite a while as well.

Another angle of approach; look at focus items.  While the focus items
for the 50+ crowd are often prohibitively expensive, most of the
level II ones are pretty reasonable.  Far better than having a 10% deeper
pool (10% more wisdom/mana) is spending 10% less on a spell... because
you still have to med back that mana at the same rate so a deeper pool
doesn't change your down time at all, but spending less means you need
to med 10% less.  Order of importance Improved Healing, Mana Preservation,
Extended Enhancement... rest are of more questionable use, although when
you finally hit 56 an Ennshrouded Veil will come in handy.

Hmm, another thought, try looking up the no drop armor from KC,
this stuff rots regularly, if its high elf wearable you may find some of
it to be interesting upgrades, go when the zone is crowded and offer
to pay small amounts for loot rights.  I can't think of a similar zone
full of no drop armor that goes rotting like that, though.
