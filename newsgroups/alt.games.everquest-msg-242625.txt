Check your keyboard options and assign kneel or crouch, whatever it
is, to a key.  This is useful for PLing as stated here but it also has
another, much more important use: interrupting spells.  You start
casting a spell and need to interrupt it NOW?  Kneel.  The spell is
immediately interrupted.  Stand back up and you can immediately start
casting again...no need to wait til the cast timer finishes.

Also, does feign death still work as a PL tool?  I just noticed this
person has a necro.  I remember that at one time, with my monk, I was
able to damage a mob down to around 25% (before it started to run) and
then feign.  If the PLee finished the mob, he would get experience. 
However for some reason it seemed that if the mob started to run
before I feigned, he wouldn't get experience.  Perhaps he was just
outdamaging me because I feigned early enough though...not sure.  It
might be worth checking out though.
