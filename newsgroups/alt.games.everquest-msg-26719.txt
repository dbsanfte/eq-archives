FWIW. I seldom heal people. Problem is, as you noticed, they get used to
sucking from the tit so to speak. If you stand anywhere and heal people,
pretty soon you will have every idiot in the joint attacking yellow mobs and
running back in front of you with the "Heal plz". I've tried it, you will
get about a 1/2 dozen there and you are oom inside of 10 minutes after
healing the first one.

My standard response when someone is getting beat to death or asks for a
heal is to hit them with SoW and say one of two things, "run" or "zone". It
is almost funny how many 'get it' as soon as they see that lupine aura blurb
and "run". I don't think I have had a single one ask "heal" after they have
seen the message, they hit the ground running. With their SoW up and my
canned response, they know what to expect from me so they never bother
asking for another heal. Much more mana efficient.
