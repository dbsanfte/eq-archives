Really, no one should.  Abstracts are great in mathematics.  They're 
kinda suck when used as principles that effect human beings.

Nobody's perfect, and the person with a flaw like diabetes or obesity or 
poor vision (my husband and I are both nearsighted and my father was 
also nearsighted) or what-have-you probably also has some gift... and 
that could be nothing more than the fact that they're nice people.

Take Annie for example (ha, yes, I'm going to embarrass you).  Judging 
from her posts on AGE and what I've seen of her on EQ, she's probably 
one of the nicest folks I've met online.  She's well-spoken, patient, 
even-tempered, damned helpful... oh, and she's good to cats.  :)

Honestly, I'd rather a couple of genetically flawed but GOOD people 
having and raising a child than a pair genetically perfect ubermenchen 
who aren't.

But, again... abstracts suck.

Another sidenote.

When I was, oh, around a decade younger, in late high school and most of 
college, I had a really snarky, superior, us-versus-mundanes attitude 
wherein I felt that 99.9% of the human race was worthless and scum and 
ought to go die.  Then I grew up, got out, met more people... and the 
more people I met, the less I thought that.  Now I'm a disgusting 
optimist who thinks that most people are generally good folks, and that 
it's the bad ones, not the good ones, who are the exceptions.  And even 
the bad ones can be redeemed... well, 99.9% of 'em anyway.  Heh.  (Which 
is the main reason I'm against the death penalty, but that's a whooooole 
other flamewar, so nevermind.)

So, yeah.

ObEverQuest: You know, maybe I've just been lucky, but I really haven't 
met more than a handful of scumbags while playing EQ.  That goes 
serverwide, not just FV.  Sure, there are the clueless, the d00ds, the 
dweebs, but very few people who made me snarl.

2nd ObEverQuest: I'm pretty sure that the Iksar only allow the mating of 
genetically near-perfect members of their race.  But do you really wanna 
take your example from a bunch of lizards?  :)
