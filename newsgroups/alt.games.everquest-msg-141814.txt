When soloing/hunting with friends, I always have 2 procing weapons equipped,
main: the staff from tunare that procs ensnare, and offhand primal velium
fistwrap that procs avater (massive stat/atk boost)

Avater procs a *lot* anyway, but in all honesty I have never noticed a
difference (or direct link) between the number of snares and whether avater
has proc'd or not (avater makes all my stats 255 that aren't already)

Avater is up 99.9% of the time when im in continous fight (all stats 255)
but the first fight of the day where they aren't all maxed (dunno if dex is
or not.. i'll check when i get home) i still proc snare the same as fight
2,3,10,100

Boon (WW form) and Imp form has its own proc built in (lifetap, and is it a
dd nuke?) which seem to proc a shitload anyway
