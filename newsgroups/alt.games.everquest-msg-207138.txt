Dual, fast weapons are not always the way to go.  Procs are the best way to
hold aggro, and those vary weapon to weapon.  You need to know your arsenal.
For quite a while, a two hander was my best aggro and damage weapon.

Know how to break mez without losing aggro.

Understand how taunt works.

Know when you have built up enough aggro to call assist without losing
control of the mob.  (Which is, trust me, a bit more complex than it
sounds.)

Understand how to position a mob and how to aim him where he needs to go.
Learn when you're able to lead a mob, especially a summoning one, and when
he must be pushed there by the other melees.

You described a competent warrior, not a good or great warrior.  As with
many other things, it's not just knowing what to do, it's also the
execution.

If you want to boil it down to basic instructions such as this, I could
create the same for any class, and profess how easy they are to play.  Being
a warrior (or any other class) is easy.  Being a good warrior is not.  And
you won't get to be a good warrior without practice.
