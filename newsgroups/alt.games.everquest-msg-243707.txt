Colorful. Granted, let's say I just paid him $10 to get me as many as he 
could.

Of course I woundn't. His time becomes vastly less valuable to me at that 
point. Just like the plat brokers would go out of business if that were 
the case with them. However, it still seems that paying my little brother 
to procure anything at all for me in game would be ok. Therefore, how is 
it not ok for it to be done on a larger scale?

For the record, I certainly recognize the problems RL transactions for EQ 
items/plat *can* cause. I may or may not have been inconvenienced by it 
myself in the past, though I naturally wouldn't have known its true 
nature at the time.

Unfortunately for me, it tends to fall into the same category as so many 
other things in life that I find to be intrusive to me or against my own 
beliefs, yet are perfectly legal. I don't necessarily condone it, though 
I find it really hard to impose my own will and demand its abolishment.
