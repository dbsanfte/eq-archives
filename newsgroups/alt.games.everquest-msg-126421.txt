Few things, really..

In similar situations on Prexus, the lead GM has claimed he can NOT see who
first engaged a mob.  Either our lead GM was too lazy, a liar, your GM was a
liar, or wanted to fob you guys off.

Also, are you aware Rage spawns in 2 forms?  Firstly he is human, and then
he becomes a dragon.   Did they engage the human model first?  Or was it the
dragon they engaged first?  Who got exp on the human?

Rage isn't a simple or clear cut camp to determine "rightful" owners.

He

Getting 20+ people to petition is generally a bad idea, you know.  Why
couldn't their raid leader/guild leader speak for the guild?  Im sure it
goes down much better with the GM's

Lol.. well assuming this is true (and I have seen occasions where
GM's/Guides have done very very wrong things...) you didn't tell us how the
conversation went.

/tell GM sigh GMS are fuckin useless! IT WAS MY RAGE R U FUKIN BLIND???
HELP ME BASTARD!  I WANNA SPEAK TO YOUR SUPERVISOR, U COCK SUCKING
INCOMPETENT BASTARD!

I mean, thats one way of asking to speak to his supervisor...  well I think
you get the point.

And like you said, you know all this only from somebody elses say so.  Ever
