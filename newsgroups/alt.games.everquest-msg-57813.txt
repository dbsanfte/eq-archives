AFAIK the full saying is "Let's make like a tree and leaf" (leave -
i.e. get the hell out of there...).
I think our friend was (gently) pulling the leg of the original
poster.

As for "bite me", I have no idea where it comes from, but I understand
it to be a slightly politer invitation from the speaker to whomever he
is speaking to f*ck off.

Brian

P.S. I play in Europe (Ireland) and I stayed on The Seventh Hammer.  I
started up a chanter on AB (Mezzanine - say Hi if you see me there)
and I noticed no appreciable drop in Ping or PL from SH to AB.  (I use
56K dialup and ping generally (on SH) is around 300 with 0%PL (the odd
spike of 5-10% not withstanding).  I got more or less the same figures
on AB.  I didnt notice any great difference in zoning times either.
