This isn't quite correct.

All robe-type casters get the quick-cast ability at 5th
level.  You hit the QC button, then a spell button and
you cast the spell in half the time and at double the
mana cost, and it is uninterruptable.  Healers don't
get this (except for Hibernian Mentalists, who are robe
types).  On the other hand, healers get decent armor
and buffs.
