This maybe useful for anyone thinking of doing Jboot quest (have not got
round to it yet myself). I was fighting hill giants in rathe when right
before my very eyes he spawned - good thing was he just stood there for a
bit and did not leg it off like the wind like usual. Do not know if he
always spawns here but the location was 519 1726.
