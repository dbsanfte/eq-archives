When playing my level 25 DE Shadow Knight I am buffed with Vampiric
Embrace constantly and proc 3-4 time a fight. Admittedly 4 procs would
only equal 48 points of damage/healing but as I solo a lot, every
little bit helps. My dex is around 105.

As far as Necro's go ,I have never used the spell with my Necro.
Tanking Necro = Dead Necro, unless your out of mana and need to whack
a fleeing mob a couple of times to finish it off. But since you will
be using the weapon for a minimum of hits the proc percentage would be
rather low (I have nothing to back this up, just seems right
logically).
