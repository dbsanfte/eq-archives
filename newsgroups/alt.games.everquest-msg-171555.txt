Aah lemme answer that!

The truth is perhaps a dozen in any typical raiding guild will "know"
the answer, and perhaps half of them will actually understand why it
works, while the other half just know it works from either personal
experience or witnissing/reading other people's experiences.

The rest of the so-called uberguild is simply there because they
played enough to have gotten the equipment and or levels to qualify,
made a friend in the guild, and aren't incompetant enough to piss the
leaders off. In other words, exactly the same as any other player,
uberguild or not. They wouldn't be able to do jack if they were in the
leadership role alone.

And I think a lot less people are in that first category than think
they are. I wonder how many guilds are operating on strategies they
themselves learned vs how many are using strategies they read on FoH's
webpage or elsewhere and mindlessly duplicate.
