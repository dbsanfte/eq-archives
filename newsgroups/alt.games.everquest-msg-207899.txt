    The "easiest" skill paths to 250 in both Tailoring and Smithing require
massive numbers of imbued emeralds, three per combine attempt. I can't begin

    I've only had to do the rare imbue for the rare cleric deities, mostly
because people with those deities give up on cultural when they see how rare
the clerics are that can do them. Clerics of Bertox? Heh, yeah, right.
