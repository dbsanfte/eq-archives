I'm familier with the series (anime, manga) but have not actually played 
the game. (It is a Christmas gift... though I expect to borrow it from 
the guy sometime in the next 2-3 years... He's almost done with 3 he 
thinks... Got him 1 for birthday, 2 for christmas last, and 3 for 
birthday...)

4 is apparantly scarce as hen's teeth...

I personally thought the server downtime to make you read the message 
boards was a nice touch.
