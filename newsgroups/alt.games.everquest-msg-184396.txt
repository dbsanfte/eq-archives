EQOA is very different from the PC version.  Can't tell you if you'd 
like the PC version better.  I like and play both.
What server are you on and what is your character name?
Have you done all your quests up to your current level?  Depending on 
your class/race, I may be able to assist with advice on where to get 
items for questing.  Check out the forums for more advice, theres the 
EQOA official forums, there's the Caster's realm ones 
<eqoa.crgaming.com>, and then there's the Allakhazam ones 
<eqoa.allakhazam.com>

Have fun exploring and try to get as many coaches as possible as early 
as possible, it'll help out later on.

(the abbreviated list of my characters, LOL)
