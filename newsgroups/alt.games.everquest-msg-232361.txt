It's best when working paired with enchanter using charm - he can't
send the pet to attack until mez is broken, and your root will break
it without making it take off.

Of course some enchanters keep a damaging spell up so they can break
it themselves but with so many spells and only 8 slots I'm sure
they're happy when someone else can do it.
