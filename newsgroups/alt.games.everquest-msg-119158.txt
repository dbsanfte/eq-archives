What makes you believe that?  As I recall, when the Conquest affair
happened on Lanys, the GM was using guildchat to communicate with the
Conquest players.

Verant may not be a collection of geniuses (they're only a game company
after all) but I've no doubt they can monitor any chat channel they care
to whenever they feel the need, and without detection by the players.
It would not be difficult to implement, and has painfully obvious value
helping to resolve CS issues that involve possible player misconduct
and/or disputes between players.

Nowhere in any materials published by Sony/Verant have I seen any
assurance of privacy for any in-game communications.
