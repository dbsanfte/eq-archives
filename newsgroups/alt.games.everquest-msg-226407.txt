You keep insisting that everyone was so put off by it.  I'm not so sure it
was true.  I do find it kind of ironic, however that you've got issues with
people having to buy something -you- don't like in order to get something
that you think shouldn't have been sold in the first place.

As far as my keychain analogy goes, tying is tying.  Does it matter what
value people put on what's being tied in?  Some will put more, some will put
less.  You seem to value the key chain as much as you do the RTS that's
being bundled with the EQ2 Beta, so what does it matter?

Really?  One would think that the ability to add value to a product would
encourage competition.  Silly me.

In as much as those are somewhat monopolistic, then I don't find it
acceptable.  However, SoE doesn't exactly have a monopoly on MMORPGs (and
even if they did, I wouldn't exactly consider that market to be vital enough
to worry about it), it's not much of a comparison.

Many circumstances make having a land line telephone, ie, my ship requires
that my cell phone not be my sole contact number.  Cell Phones are not
always feasable, nor is VoIP, especially for those who cannot afford a
computer or internet access, or don't want internet access.  For now, a
landline telephone is the standard in telecoms.  As long as that happens,
and as long as they remain a monopoly, then tying should be illegal.
However, if there were five local carriers running around in any one area,
then I see no problem with tying.  The first time one carrier tried to force
it's customers into something they didn't want, there would be four local
carriers in that area.
