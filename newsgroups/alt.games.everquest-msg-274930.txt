    The Zeks were an empty wasteland (even more so than normal) after the 
release of PVP-friendly WoW. Someone posted the LDoN stats for all the 
servers on EQLive, and the Zeks were at half or less of a comparable blue 
server. Considering that the blue servers have seen numbers drop by about a 
third, a merge of some sort had to be done. Kane Bayle also has Zek-like 
numbers, so I'm sure we'll see that experiment also be folded. Beyond that, 
hard to say. My server is down 35% over pre-WoW numbers, but seems to be 
holding semi-steady now. Combining us with another typical blue server would 
result in a server much more crowded than pre-WoW, so that wouldn't work 
well. So what do you do? Split a server, possibly splitting up friends and 
making them quit? I think SOE secretly hopes that all the new Zek players 
use the free /movelog they've been given and go blue. That would let SOE put 
all the resources they've used on PVP to use on the PVE game, and give the 
blue servers a small boost in numbers.
