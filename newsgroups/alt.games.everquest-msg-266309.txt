Our postman should be scared this week. Not only are my little ladies (an 
alsatian and husky) keeping an eye out for him this week but they are joined 
by a rather strange desperate looking adult with a peculiar glint in his 
eyes.

I pre ordered with gameplay (UK) does anyone know if they are prompt senders 
or did I shop from a retail lemon?
