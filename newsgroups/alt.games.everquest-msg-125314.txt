Yes, all right, there was an enchanter there in the particular case I
mentioned.  Doesn't really matter though, since the bard will just
sing something else which will be useful to the *entire* group, a
subtlety you appear to miss.

Do you know that it was "junk" or are you just assuming your buffs are
better?  Again, your buffs only affect you (well, with the exception
of MOP), a bard's affect the entire group.  Your experience with bards
has been quite different than mine, but then again I don't cast a
garage sale of buffs on myself before every battle.  I find bards
*extremely* useful to have around and that they increase a group's
effectiveness enormously.  Of course, they don't tank so hot, but
that's a different thread...

And incidentally, as a cleric, Jolting Blades would be the *last*
thing I would want you to click off.

Storm Strength is an essential spell??

And as far as the ATK stuff, sure, *your* ATK might be higher with
your spell than with the bard's, but it isn't just about you, is it?
And the ranger in this scenario was getting way too much aggro as it
was; a bit less ATK might have been a good thing.

Hell, I even think you could lose the 26 AC from CoE in a situation
where you aren't supposed to be getting aggro and you have a dedicated
cleric to heal you.

The prima donna comment stands.
