Huh??!! How the hell did you get that out of what I said? I didn't say that
at all, nothing even remotely like that!

I said, just because there are bigger evils in the world dosen't make lesser
evils okay.

No, but whatever good things they may have done don't make thier long and

okay.

Which totally ignores the fact that Microsoft changed my (and everyone
elses) preferences and gave out email addreses after being specifically told
not to, without any notice at all.  Care to address the actual point I was
