	JIHAD!

	Kosh knew there would be Dire Consequences if he told too much of what he
knew.  Can't say more without a honking huge spoiler.

	I happen to agree with that school of thought.  If time travel did exist
and could change history, then as Larry Niven pointed out, it would be one of
the last things discovered by a society before destroying itself.

	I also think JMS was very good at showing enough of future developments to
make people think they knew what was going on, then showing that it wasn't
what people thought, without cheating the viewer in the process.

	And lets be fair...there are only two time-travel episodes in the series
(one of them a two-parter).  Three if you want to count a story set a million
years in the future.

|    I also found most of the characters to be overblown, with not a trace of
|nuance to them. 

	Now you're completely out in left field.

|For example, from ST:TNG, I found Data, Worf, and Picard to
|be compelling characters. They weren't cardboard cutouts, and their foils
|(Lore, pretty much any Klingon, Riker) created interesting storylines.

	Data was the only one of the three with any real development.  Worf was a
stock Klingon and Picard was too busy surrendering to develop as a character.

|It
|didn't have the overall plot quality of B5, something I will praise the
|series for, but it was great as a character study. B5, in my opinion, had
|only two characters really worth watching to see:
|what's-his-former-security-captain-controlled-by-Psi, and Londo. The
|ex-security guy's storylines came off as very irrelevant to the overall
|story, so he was marginalized.

	Garibaldi's issues changed the course of history at least once in season
5.

|I just
|wish they hadn't spoiled his fate with stupid time travel episodes. :-/

	JMS told us Londo's fate in episode 1....

|
|    So, yeah. I'd put B5 at about the same level of quality as ST:Deep Space
|9. Good story arc, many sci-fi cliches, and a lot of throwaway characters.

	The only primary character I'd classify as "throwaway" is Dr. Franklin.
He was just kind of there.
