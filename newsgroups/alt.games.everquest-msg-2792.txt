You are casting too early in the fight, or the fighter is not
taunting. As a nuker your job is to finish off the mobs when they are
at half health or less. If you over-nuke then you will jump to the
head of the mob's hate list and it will turn on you. 

As a caster you have to think fast and assess the situation. If the
fighter(s) have pulled more than one mob you need to wait until that
mob is almost dead to do your thing. Otherwise you will have all off
the others, and maybe even the one the fighter(s) is engaged with,
beating on you. 

When in a group stand as far away from the fight as possible. Start
out by using small nukes to get a feel for when the mob's will start
hating you more than the fighter(s). When you see the mob ignore the
fighter(s) beating on it and charge towards you, you know you hit it
too hard and too early. At this point DO NOT run and DO NOT cast
again. Give the fighter(s) a chance to taunt the mob off of you and to
hurt it enough to make it ignore you and fight them.
