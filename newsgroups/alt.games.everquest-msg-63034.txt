This is wrong . Everquest does indeed install a .dll . The installation of
said .dll should in no way hinder other operations unless someone goofed big
time but they do indeed add system files . Any serious game will do the same
though.

The big deal over the upgrade is upgrading to directx8 which is not optional
, my present system can not be so upgraded . I am using a old 3dfx blaster
banshee card. I could replace just the card for a $100 or so but since the
rest of my system is just as old and new powerfull computers are available
so cheaply I am going to bite the bullet and build a mostly new system.
Luclin is going to cause me to spend about $1200. For a lot of people that
may be out of their price range and I can see some becomming upset.
