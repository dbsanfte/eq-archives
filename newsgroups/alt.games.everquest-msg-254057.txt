I looked for that when I scanned my logs earlier in this thread,
and didn't find such a case, but I might just've missed it.  If
you're right, it suggests there really are three separate checks:

(1) Does the Intimidate skill work?  If not, "You're not scaring anyone."

(2) Does the Kick hit?  If not, "You try to kick but miss."  Note that
this still doesn't prove that your Kick skill level matters; it could be
doing a kick while using your Intimidate skill as the effective level,
for instance.

(3) Does the mob resist?  If so, your kick hits and does non-melee
damage (which is one reason I'm not convinced it's the real Kick skill
that matters), but "Your target resisted the fear spell."  Else it
"looks very afraid."

I'd guess that failing check #1 doesn't generate agro, but failing steps
#2 or #3 get the mob's attention, just like any other missed attack or
resisted spell.
