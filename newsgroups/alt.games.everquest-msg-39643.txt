It does seem pretty dumb, but if you never unstack it, you can
right-click on the stack in a general inventory slot, and thus drink
your way through the stack. If you left-click it to pick one up off the
stack though, creating a stack of 19 and a stack of 1 (on your cursor),
the 19 poof, being duplicate lore items.
