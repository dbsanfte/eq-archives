Having done every role in an AOE group except healer, I feel qualified to
speak on this.

For an AOE group you need:

One steel-nerved enchanter (or a mentally deficient one)
One FAST healer
Three people with PBAOE damage spells
One puller with no sense of self-preservation at all - I recommend paladins.

Alternate groups:
One enchanter (see above)
Four PBAOErs
One puller who can heal

Two enchanters (see above)
Three PBAOErs
One puller who can heal

etc...

The hard - and - fast rule is: At least one enchanter, at least two people
with PBAOE spells (though I won't do it with less than three), one healer.

PBAOErs, in order of effectiveness:
Wizard - #1, no question
Mage - #2, good PBAOEs but slow to go off
Druid/Cleric - #3, very slow PBAOEs, mana inefficient

Locations:  Area with as few casters as possible.  At various levels, I've
PBAOEd BlackBurrow, Charasis, Sebilis, Karnor's, and Chardok.  My favorite
would have to be Chardok (tunnels by the bank), though Sebilis Disco is a
close second.

Formation:
'Free' PBAOE - place the enchanter in an easy-to-find location - nothing
worse than a puller who can't find the group.  Place your PBAOE group around
the enchanter, evenly spaced and close - hug tight!  Fire off your
smallest-diameter color stun; everyone except the puller MUST be inside the
field.  CASTERS FACE INWARD.

'Walled' PBAOE - put enchanter in an easy-to-find location, up against a
wall or in a corner.  Everyone but puller gathers in tight, as above.
CASTERS FACE CORNER.

Load:
Enchanter load: all four PBAOE stuns, rune, Wave of Tash if you have it.
Caster load: all of your PBAOE spells
Healer load: Not having played a healer in this arena, I won't presume to
advise.
Puller load: Defensive spells and something to pull with (if puller is pure
melee, just pray a lot).

Technique:
Puller goes out and gets a heapin' helpin' of mobs.  I consider 20 or so
mobs a noobish PBAOE pull; 30 to 50 is about right. One of the better PBAOE
pullers I know is a paladin who gets an invis on the way out, runs out until
invis drops, stuns three or four mobs at long range, hits DA and runs back
through the crowd she ran out past.  In Chardok, she reliably brought back
50 or 60 mobs.

Puller trains the group; as mobs start coming in, enchanter starts chaining
PBAOE stuns.  When all the mobs are caught in the stunweb, PBAOE casters
start chaining damage.  30 seconds later, start looting.
