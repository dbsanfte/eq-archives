Thought I'd poke a little hole in your theory that when perfect fairness 
cannot be achieved, total random is logically the next best option. :) 
I'm going to hold out hope for some as yet undiscovered loot system that 
is better than total random for pickup groups.

Actually even there its not *so* bad... I was there with a friend and we 
were camping forest loops not so long ago (mid 30s bard & pali at the 
time), so we 'could camp it' and we 'did need it'. And we got a tell 
from a warrior in the pok who was looking for something to do, and was 
presumably sending random tells to anyone in his level range... we 
replied that we were trying to get a forest loop, and that we were fine, 
but if he wanted to join us for xp and a share of any other loot (which 
didn't really cost us much as the various weapon drops there are lore 
anyways) he was more than welcome... and he gladly accepted.

This was pre-LDON and people are less group hungry than they used to be 
so this may not happen so much anymore.
