 I don't care about stuff !!!  Or so I believed. I played all the MMORPG'S
and really never had dick compared to other players. I'd give away my 
stuff or never desire to acquire. 

Then along came CoH.  Bought it the other day, like a chump, and not even 
1 hour in I'm thinking, where's the bloody stuff ? There's no stuff ! what's 
the point without stuff ? The answer is, there's no point without stuff.

Clicking on a monster you just killed with the hope of getting some reward, 
is far superior to not being able to get any stuff at all. CoH reminds me of 
an asshole trend to not keep score in kids sports. Like they don't know who
won or lost.

Two stinking days after paying 70 bucks Canadian, and I have no desire 
whatsever to log in.

With no stuff--what's left ?
