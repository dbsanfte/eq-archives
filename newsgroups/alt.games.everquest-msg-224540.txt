Hello,

Since the recent patches, I have noticed that I can no longer see the
colored "ring" around the mobs that I target.

I can also no longer right-click on my spell book and pull up my spell sets
to mem, nor can I right click on a spell slot and have the menu to mem
another spell.

Any ideas on what might be causing these issues?

I have 224meg of ram, and a NVIDIA GeForce2 MX/MX 400 video card.  I just
updated the drivers also, but it did not solve my problem.  I also reverted
to the default UI, but that didn't help either.

Thanks for the help.
