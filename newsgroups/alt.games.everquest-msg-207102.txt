Really?  You think it's worthwhile to spend 8 months locked at L52,
and calling in sick everytime Vox or Naggy is due to spawn?  or
18 months at 52 because you aren't irresponsible enough to skip
work for EQ?  or join some lame-assed goober guild full of foul
mouthed punks and bork your social life for months so that you can
get your books off the "real" dragons?  Sorry, but there's a reason
I and more than a few other Paladins never seriously considered
pursuing the pathetic excuse for an "experience" that is the Paladin
"epic" quest.
