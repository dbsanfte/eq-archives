Its not bad, I'd go for crustacean plate though. Around 38 a set of
that would add a couple hundred hp just from the stamina. HP > str and
the crusty has str too. Really crusty is all you need until you can
afford a barbed ringmail bp which is one of the best you can get at 30
ac 10 str 50 hp and around 5 k plat on my server, it beats old plane
bps and is a lot like the no drop Stonewood mail from plane of growth.

Rygorr is pretty low ac for a plate class, while not offering much
else.
