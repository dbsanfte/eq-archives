I tend to not leave myself targeted anymore.  A few levels back, I had left
myself targeted, I got beset upon by a pair of Drolvargs.  I tried to root
one.  Needless to say, my root worked, and the Drolvargs had a field day
killing me in a few short seconds.  I was with a ranger who did not realize
what I had done, until too late.  She did manage to heal me once out of
unconsciousness.  I told her I was rooting one, so she did not worry,
assuming that she would easily be able to handle the unrooted one, while I
backed off, or worst case, we could run.  Two Drolvarg Ragers made very
quick work of me without breaking my root.  I was laughing at that for quite
some time afterwards.
