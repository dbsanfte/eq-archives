Yep ;)  Oh god.. the names we will see... I'm wondering how many
verant will bother to crack down on. Of course some of these would be
against the rules and some not.

Male:

Tony

Toni

Tuftin (some may not remember this, the cat prince friend of Kamandi
from the old Kamandi comics.. semi obscure though. I'd kind of like
seeing that and tell the person "ooh kamandi!")

Toonces (sp, the driving cat from SNL a few years ago)

Morris

Cat, Kat, etc.


Female:

Tawni 

Tawny

Kitty

Meow (I'm sure we'll see that, and variations of kitty sound effects
for both male and female.. rawr etc)

Mitty (stupid gold ring.. then they changed it before I ever got from
her)
