Go to your favorite general purpose EQ website (mine is
http://eq.castersrealm.com) and find out what pages are needed for that
spell.  Buy the research container (Tome of Endless Enchantments, I think).
Any time you're near a vendor look at their inventory to see if they have
any of the pages you need and buy them when you see them.

Oh, step .5, if you have Luclin, go to Katta and see if that research-only
spell is available for sale there.  If not, proceed below.

Once you have the pages you need for a spell, keep the pages in the tome on
you at all times and keep your eye out for a high level enchanter.  Politely
ask them to combine the spell for you, offer to pay (almost certainly
declined), and you should have no trouble having them do it for you.

I'm on Zeb and my research is pretty high (150 or better) so if that's your
server let me know.  I don't have any spare pages for that spell
though...I'm looking for them for myself for a friend. :)
