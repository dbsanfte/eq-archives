Back to the original point being made :)

I play a 65 cleric and I will admit to being bossy at times. In my
defense though I will add that a cleric has a lot of time to look
around and see how things work out. He see's who needs healing and
when, he see's the way the battle is progressing and learns tactics by
watching.    

Sometimes there are people in your group who dont play that much and
need a nudge in the right direction. Normally I keep my mouth shut but
sometimes I have been known to boss people around. A good example is
reminding a  melee person to only attack from the rear unless tanking.
I have to say this one the most ;-)
