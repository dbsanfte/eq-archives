<RP stance ON>

One could also point out that priest classes may be wise, but they aren't
book smart.  

<RP stance OFF>

<thinks about that for a while>

Aww crap, I see so many loop holes in that, not to mention the obvious one
that the RP stance never held much weight with Verant.  I spent 4 years
doing "research" IRL and I know it takes just as much "wisdom" (ala
intuitive leaps) as it takes "brains" (ala logic and careful analysis).
