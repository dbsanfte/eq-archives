Wrong. So wrong it more or less invalidates your entire post, but
we'll indulge it anyways.

If its a situation where people are "explaining" themselves, its
probably another implementation not done right. This inability to
think outside of whats been done that you are showing is part of the
exact problem the author was talking about; you are in fact turning
into a case study.

SB failed in so many other ways it can't be used as any sort of
guideline - even if its PvP system were good (which it isn't), its
plethora of other flaws doom it. DAoC didn't give nearly the freedom
of action, or interaction, that the author was talking about. It was
one small step in the right direction but nowhere near enough, and
even worse is going the wrong way.

And again you seem to be having trouble understanding the PvP is not
an isolated case - it is part of the greater problem of mmorpgs
lacking "world" elements, and DAoC especially is lacking in that
regard in other areas.

Your lack of imagination is noted.

Your attempt to spin away from the issue is noted. The PvP is merely a
part of being a "world" with interaction in all directions; trying to
pretend its not related to the other issues is just a pathetic attempt
to try to dismiss relevant answers because you don't like the
response.

Your incorrect assessment of my position is noted, as is your obvious
inexperience with PvP and inability to see it as anything other than
ganking.

I begin to feel its pointless to even talk to you when your basis of
experience renders you incapable of responding intelligently. Until
you learn the difference between random ganking and other forms of
PvP, you are making yourself out to be rather ignorant and irrelevant.

As I've (and now others) have already pointed out to you, RvR
qualifies - but then you seem to be about as knowledgable about DAoC
as you are about UO, and that ain't much.
