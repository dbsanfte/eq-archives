If more people had done that instead of the twenty on one bind spot
camping that was actually occuring the most, it still might be around.

However I think the biggest problem with MPCs was that it was on
*test*. Two people in ill omen wasn't enough to make playing a
sabretooth kitten fun....

And Unrest was filled to the brim with the corpses of MPCs
suiciding... because there was no one there.

Had they tried this on a populated server where people have the
numbers to fight back, it might have worked.

My idea was to limit it to one zone a night, and everyone would always
spawn as a monster there (any zone, not necessarily newbie monsters).
Then anyone who wants to fight intelligent monsters could go there,
and the MPCs could fight other monsters in the dungeon.

But nothing ever came of it. Guess Verant doesn't listen to everything
I say after all.
