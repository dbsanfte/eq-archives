Supporting standards compliant browsers is more universal than 
supporting IE.

Consider cars. Suppose Ford is the most popular & used car on the road. 
Does it make sense to design roads that can only be driven on by 
fords??... or does it make sense to design roads that conform to a road 
standard that ford *and* many other car makes and models also meet.

Precisely... a website that conforms to the strict html spec is 
supported by every modern browser out there. It makes more sense to 
target the html spec than IE.
