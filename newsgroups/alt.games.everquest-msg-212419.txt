Its Damage Per Second, which is of course inaccurate, as noone actually
does damage in nice easy predictable amounts at one second intervals.
However, with mob life spans often measured in under 20 seconds, or
sometimes in over an hour, getting an average damage done per unit time
is interesting, and since its easier to multiply seconds out to get to
hours than it is to divide hours up to get down to seconds, a per second
unit size seems reasonable.

DPS comes in several flavors; Burst and Sustained being the main ones;
Burst DPS being what you can do full out blowing chunks of mana till you
run dry (if it takes that long) or using offensive disciplines or potions
or what have you,  and Sustained being what you can keep putting out for
an hour straight if need be.

"Outfitted for high DPS" -might- mean sacrificing armor and HP and misc
stats in order to maximize DPS... or it might just mean that they have
gotten better gear in general like anyone else would.  Hard to say
without seeing it in context
