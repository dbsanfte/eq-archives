Here is the official warning from Verant on the EQ site:

This is to alert the EverQuest community that we are NOT accepting
applications for EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin beta testing. If an
individual or organization solicits your username, passwords, or any
personal information regarding beta testing an SOE product, YOU ARE BEING
SCAMMED. At no time will we ask for your username and password to verify
account information. We already have all the information we need on file.
Once again, we are NOT accepting applications for beta testing.

It has to do more with Luclin then with a new program, but just know that
you should not give up any private information, and NEVER password
information.
