I guess what the real issue I have is that this is yet another example
of Verant's lack of foresight. I know if I were a game designer, there's
no way in hell I'd put in an item for the general masses that had
insta-cast invis. But to leave it in game for a year, then take it out
just for some changes to *pvp* of all things... Bah, I'm over it now.
Just pissed me off since I had cajoled and hassled several people in
game to agree to help me go get one the weekend after the patch...
