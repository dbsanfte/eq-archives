While I agree with you more than with the original poster, I'm slightly
peeved over not being allowed to heal or buff characters on the other
teams. Not grouping with them, fair enough, but the character I plan to
roleplay would not withhold a heal from a Dark Elf who is being eaten
alive by giant spiders. Would preach his ear off afterwards, of course,
but would not let him die.

Not allowing cross-alignment assistance actually detracts from the RP
environment (although I do agree about different alignments not grouping
together).
