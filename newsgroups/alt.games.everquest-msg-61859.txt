Depends how much its worth, Customs aint dragging back if its below a
certain level they just pass it through. And its hardly the same if you
get it a number of weeks in advance.....yes its not the same as
simultaneous release but if you want it....Customs needed be a hold up
either if you alert them to the incoming package and pay for it in
advance.
