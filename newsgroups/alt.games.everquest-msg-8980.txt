  I saw a post recently on advice with an enchanter. I was excited because
not many posts are about enchanters, and I (a newbie) play an enchanter.
Unfortunately, the post mostly consisted on tactics and advice for
enchanters in, at least, 20+ levels. My enchanter is level 15 now. I don't
get to play alot, but when I do I love it.
  I have been somewhat disappointed at the fact that when I'm trying to join
a group, they will ask, "Do you have Breeze?" and I have to respond in the
negative and tell them that I won't get Breeze for another level. This makes
it somewhat difficult to group with people that I are not already my
friends.
  This lack of grouping had somewhat made me jaded to even finding a group.
From levels 10 to 13 or so, I solo'ed by fear kiting or root-dotting. I did
a lot of crafts and quests. I have the earrings from the Cubert quest in
Qeynos and I did the Stein of Moggok quest. Things like that. My jewelry
skill is 75. Anyway, lots of role playing stuff. Recently though (level 14),
I decided that I really really really wanted to level up and get new spells
and get respectable.
  So, at level 14, I met some wonderful gamers that I have grouped with
about four times or so. We grouped up in Crushbone, in the throne room.
We've killed King Crush twice now. I leveled to 15. It has been great. My
roll in our groups have been mostly mez'ing. Which is pretty stranuous as it
is. When you are in the throne room and there are like seven around, it can
really drain the mana down. When we have smaller groups of mobs, I will
debuff the target mob and/or cast my Dot. Most of the time though, I just
mez.
  Another thing I have used on ocation is Sooth, so we can just pull one at
a time. Not too usefull IN the throne room, but with the slavers in the back
of Crushbone, pretty good. I have also been known to cast Languid Pace on a
target, because someone told me somewhere, that when you root a mob, they
fight to the death, but if you just "slow" them, it is better. It didn't
seem to make the walk any slower, and the rangers in the group felt just
fine using snare anyway.
  I did see in the before mentioned post, a tip about changing to the above
view when having to mez everyone and their brother. I knew the experience
well; running around the room so I can target someone. I will definately try
that one. What do you do about double spawns though? When you have two mobs
identically in the same spot hitting?
  Anyway, I would like to hear more tips and suggestions about the use of
low level enchanters. If anyone can offer some advice, that would be great.
Thank you.
