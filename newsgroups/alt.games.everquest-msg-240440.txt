I recall that there were about 500 mobs in Field of Bone (according to
ShowEQ), and that's somewhere in the middle of zone sizes, I think.  So, I
could believe an average of 500 per zone.

Maybe they mean 1 million NPCs total for all servers?  Or maybe they are
counting every possible spawn, rather than just the ones that are up at a
given time (e.g., all the rares are included)?
