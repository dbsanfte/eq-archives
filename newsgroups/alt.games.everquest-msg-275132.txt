This is my fourth MMO

I like solo and grp but surely the idea of a group is to make tougher 
challenges simpler or even possible then doing it solo.

This is where EQ2 goes wrong it is dsigned from a grp raid perspective and 
soloers are generally given the scraps. Bare in mind many do not want to 
solo but CANNOT find grp.

A grp of lvl 20s be able to take on lvl 25 mob and quest and it should be as 
simple as that.

I am tempted to go back to AC1
