Ive been using the odd blue "goblin raider" in fm for this, but after taking
45 mins to get from 190 to 191, id like to find something that hits a little
softer so I have more combat and less running around healing myself (im a
bard)

Vampire bats in Lguk seem pretty wimpy, but long combats in there are
probably not gonna work.

So I need a really soft hiting monster thats just blue at 39.
