I solo'd the Prince in Warrens with my 19th level SK, he was tough but I
could often manage it. I didn't a single decent drop from him.

I haven't tried Stonebrunt with an appropriate level character (My SK at 30
now) I did walk around with my Warrior and have a look about, not much use
to him at 47 there. Still got aggro'd.

I have since spent time solo'ing the Named in there with my SK (Good Exp as
all the spawns get split and normally not much time between killing the last
and the next respawning) All except the King is Blue (King is green but
prolly the hardest one and still gives exp) The drops from Muglwhump are no
drop (had to leave a necro robe rot) I got the shield off him, it's not that
great, considering at 25th I solo'd Vexven in Highpass for a Cracked
Darkwood shield (that I am still using) no comparison and the mob is easier
than Muglwhump. The King, like his son, dropped nothing of use (Cold iron
greaves, that I gave to a newbie warrior in Qeynos)
The High Shaman dropped a Rune Bokken (eventually) I still have this,
looking for an untwinked newbie caster to give it to. I handed out a fair
few Bronze katana's and such but they way so much I can't carry many (notice
how the bronze weapons from the Warrens weigh more than normal bronze
weapons, especially the Bamboo ones...Do verant know what Bamboo is?) I
can't say I am impressed with the Boss loot in the Warrens, the fact that it
is no drop should really make it a little better (can only be looted by
appropriate level and can't be sold, seems like a good reason to make the
items better than they are)

The Warrens equates to good Exp, IMO, but I am not to impressed with the
high end drops, I'd say it would take a group of low - mid twenties to take
and control the King room and the drops are few and far between and not that
hot (even for that level)

I haven't tried Stonebrunt as I am waiting for a friend to catch up in
levels (currently 22nd ranger) so we can hunt there (think we'll do ok as a
partnership) I like the trivial loot code for low level hunting grounds, it
works better than the random spawn location that they use in Runnyeye.

Not been hunting in the Warrens since Stonebrunt was made active, I could
really only make it work with exp if I was taking all the boss mobs and now
SB is up it's actually busy (well in comparison to the times I was in there,
alone)

CF
The better items being no drop means I cannot even give them away.
