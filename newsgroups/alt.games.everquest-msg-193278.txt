I can give a good example of bad XP.

My 56 monk is levelling in Velks, soloing. I have major downtime there, 
but got gauze press, and Firstaid 3 AAs, so can bind wounds all my way 
up. If theres not crowded in Velks, i can make around 4% a hour there 
with 100% to XP.
Was XPing there as usual, but had LFG on to see if could get a POP 
group. Got a tell from a guy that wanted me in POI at entrance. Of 
course i headed to poi, and got in a decent group, ok kill time, 1 wipe 
(3 groups at entrance is CROWDED, and a mistake from 1 group can get the 
rest problems, lost 2 people after another groups mob went on us, rest 
got out), and made 3% XP in 1 hour 15 min.
In that case, soloing in velks with downtime were better than a full 
decent group killing in PoI at entrance, and after that i decided never 
to go back to POI for XP (tried with both druid and monk now, been VERY 
dissapointed each time).
