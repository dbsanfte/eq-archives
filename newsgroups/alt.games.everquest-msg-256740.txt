Well for the same reason that I know.. others will know. And for the same
reason <whoever> thought of it for you, somebody will think and use it.

Well, you need all you can get with a really tight force (40 people, and 4
clerics all went on vacation last week!). Specially when somebody opens the
door, and the 2 anuek respawns come inside, at the exact moment the AE
bearer pops, like our last run there.. /sigh

Well we developed and tested a strat that we know will work (back when very
few had completed it, and there was NO info - as a contrast somebody
mentioned the key part of the fight in a x-server channel i use the other
day, somebody that hasn't beaten inktu'ta even) but well.. see the number
above for why we haven't been back in a few weeks.

It seems HP is just a bad omen on our server, with the long haul and shitty
clearing, the apparant bugged nature of the event, since it died we haven't
had as many people online even once, seems people burned out on that hence
the stall at Zun'Mur.  Our rivals have burnt out on HP too (but not beaten
it) 20 odd people during peak hours for the last few days is pretty dismal
turnout for them.

All in all, tx is just a really shit zone and every minute spent in the zone
just ebbs peoples enthusiasm for the game away
