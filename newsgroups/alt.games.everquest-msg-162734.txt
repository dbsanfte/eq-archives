We've got a guy on emarr who was, for awhile, /auctioning every third
line about how if you were tired of selling that perfect owlbear pelt,
he'd take off your hands all you had for 100pp each.  Then he'd
auction that he was selling rallic packs for 1k each - I was there
when the whole zone basically said dude, shut up and buy the stupid
pelts at regular prices, and I sent him a tell telling him that if he
got tired of selling that rallic pack, I'd take it off his hands for
200pp.  He didn't seem interested. ;p
