No,what a waste of mana and a spellslot,not to speak of
the lessened damgeoutput with Jolting Blades.

A little background:
Spent 55 to 62 in PoV,mostly grouped with the same Pal,
SK or War as maintank,62 to 65 + EQ/AM3 in HoH.
Since then doing almost exclusively Ldon pickupgroups
to now 140 aa with always other maintanks.
Weapons in this time  were Delightful Orb and the notoriuos,
notorious for aggro producing,Copper Hammer of Striking.

After getting aggro from some resisted Jolts at level 55,I
banned the spell to page 49 of my spellbook,where it fits well
between Skin like Wood and Minor Healing :), and never
memorized it again.
Very rarely do I ever get aggro,and can always ditch it
by simply turning autoattack off for a second.
Even now at 65 with lots of AAs and weapon affinity 3,
still using the CHoS in offhand,meanwhile augmented
with 50 hp lifetap,and the Orb replaced by a fully augmented
Club of the Mad Researcher I dont see,what Jolt is good
for.Still its simply enough to turn autoattack off for a second.

Reason for the posting is a Ldon adv I did with my 49 Pal,where
the Ranger couldnt stop to tell the group,how happy he was
about the Jolt spell he got recently,while there was no way 
he could taken aggro from my Pally,who was happily bashing
with his shield and proccing his 243 damage nuke on those
poor undeads.  :)
