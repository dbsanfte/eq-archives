While this is in fact correct (I would be very interested in seeing the
formulas for actual success rate and what factors influence each skill, but
that's a pipe dream), the question was specifically about Mend.

Mend always succeeds at a skill of 100 - all failures and critical botches
stop after reaching that skill level. There doesn't seem to be any advantage
to a higher skill level, up to it's maximum of 200 (that is, you don't get
any additional HP back, nor does the cycle time decrease from 6 minutes).

For other skills, certainly. Mend's a bit of an odd duck, though.
