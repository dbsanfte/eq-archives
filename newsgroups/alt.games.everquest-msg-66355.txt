Turns out that if you are doing Shar Vahl beastlord quests, the
weapons you get are Hand to Hand ones.  If you can find
twink hand to hand weapons, thats the way I'd go at this point.
I"m sitting there staring at a 30 piercing and have spent half
of level 6 getting my HtH up to a massive 13 skill.

Beastlords use throwing skill but no archery, so a nice box of
shiruken would be in order for practice and pulling.

For armor, beastlord is leather class.  Right there in town is
a vendor selling "padded leather" that isn't too shabby, or
you could go with tizmak or Ulthork... or you could get really
good stuff, but in that case, you'll have to look around, I'm
afraid I don't know what high end leather is or is not Vah Shir
and BST wearable.

Base STR for Vah Shir beastlords is 90, and with a leather
class that means weight isn't a big issue, but heck, an EEBag
never hurts, does it?
