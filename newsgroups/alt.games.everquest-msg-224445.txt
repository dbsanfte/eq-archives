I don't particularly care, no, but I was responding to the OP who seemed 
shocked to find that the female necro's "wife" (quotes his) was only 
giving him ten more minutes to play.  Main thrust of the dismay was of 
course the ten more minutes part, but the quotes indicated an issue with 
the idea of a female character with a real life wife.

The word Mangina is also not mine, but was introduced by someone else in 
an earlier thread on this server.  It struck me as a mildly amusing if 
slightly off color way of expressing the concept of a female character 
played by a male player, in one word which would be instantly decipherable.

I've played a couple female characters myself, including one who was my 
main for over a year; again, not interested in the sex aspect either in 
terms of going after straight guys, or gays who might be interested in 
drag queens, nor lesbian/bi women.  My main was a cleric who treated the 
issue as an offense to her sanctity, while the other female characters 
I've played have simply downplayed the issue, which honestly rarely came up.

It was very interesting to play the female cleric, though, beyond sex 
there's a whole lot of stereotypical baggage that comes with your 
percieved gender, and this was one of the biggest journey's of discovery 
I've ever made regarding that.  Getting people to accept ideas from a 
"woman" meant a whole different approach, suggesting or requesting help 
on things rather than what works with male characters, stating opinion 
as fact or barking out orders.  I hate to admit it in this flame heavy 
and sarcasm heavy format, but it was probably the most educational 
experience I've ever had playing a role playing game (and I've done that 
in more formats than I care to think of, since 1976)

You might want to look around for tapes of a comedian named Eddie 
Izzard; he's a tranvestite, and some of his comedy bits (not the 
majority by any means) revolve around that and how it differs from the 
gay dressed as a woman thing.

At any rate, no I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I was just 
responding to the existance of the quotes around the word wife (quote 
"wife" unquote) and the wealth of possibility those little quotation 
marks implied.

Splendid One, 52 gnomage, Firiona Vie, male played by male
Praise, 49 cleric, long since retired and account sold in an effort to 
"quit" the game.  Female played by male.

I've never had a character who was male played by female or female 
played by female... I'd need some major surgery or gene alteration to do 
either!
