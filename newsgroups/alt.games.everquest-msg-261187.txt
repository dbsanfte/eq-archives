From reading post on the EQLive forums it seems that beta testers were
telling them the whole time they were in beta that the quests were, for the
most part, too hard.  Even impossible to solo many of them.  So to think
"they did the right thing to make them hard and then work towards easier" at
this point in the game is a bit silly.  You would of thought they would do
that during the "beta test" especially with so many giving feedback about
the problem.  I think either the developers don't talk to the marketing
people or SOE just doesn't care about giving casual gamers/soloers what they
say they were going to give them.

/em shakes his head and walks away dejected heading towards WoW
