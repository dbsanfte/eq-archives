    Lenny sometimes plays on Test server, and he noticed something new tonight
(no idea how long it has been active though).  When he targeted someone or
something, the target window took on the color of the con of the target.  Pretty
easy to see what they con, and not all that obtrusive.  I thought it was nicely
done, and was more than a bit relieved.  I half expected the target to be
centered by a huge glowing bull's eye that showed the con color.

   Also, if he hit "c" on a PC, yellow text directed him to get closer to same
and right click to inspect.   He got the message every time he tried to con
someone, with no way to turn it off. That I could live without.  When he clicked
on a corpse, yellow text suggested he get closer and try to loot it (it was a PC
body, so no luck there).  He was playing a level 31 BL, so these things won't
just pop up for lowbies.

   Sorry if this has been reported before.
