*cough* If you go in Paladul on the Shadeweaver side then you can start at
around level 8 there. The bugs are every bit as good exp as the rest of the
mobs in Paladul :) Thus in a weekend you can easily have a level 23-25 char.

Of course I ted to avoid Paladul with Melee types, as the levelling is SO
fast that your melee skills really atrophy.
