I guess it depends on your definition of godly.  I've been soloing my shaman
since level 34 and she's pretty darn good.  Grab a KEI and I'm off and
running I can usually solo 4-5 dark blues before I have to sit and med and
I've never been killed soloing.  She's not twinked either, no special gear,
about 650AC and 400 HP buffed and 190WIS.  Now if I could get my hands on a
JBB then maybe I'd be godly!
