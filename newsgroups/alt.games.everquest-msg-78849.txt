In case anyone wants a hint on that, Bards are the only class that gets to
"cast" while still moving faster than any other class, a very frustrating
(and often futile) experience is to be had duelling a bard that has a clue
(and most do or they quit the class)

They can't half whine when they lose tho'

I'm not a big fan of duelling in EQ. It can sometimes be fun but as a
Warrior my class is really dominated by equipment and although I am pretty
well equipped for my level (as a casual player) I can't compete with some
who has a 60 shaman and Uber Guild member (read that as hard core player)
providing equipment for them.

One thing I have learnt...don't dual in EC tunnel, too much going on making
rogues back stabbing to easy and you always get some "helpful" soul buffing
and healing one of you.
