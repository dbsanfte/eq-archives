I doubt either "good" (Oasis, NK) or "evil" (S Ro) gypsies will have
anything to do with your Iksar hide other than to try and make some
alligator slippers to sell... but players will happily pay 7pp each
for the things, and if you horde em up and sell during the high volumn
hours you should be able to get 9pp or even 10pp for em.

You see, not only do you get a book that you can sell for pp  to vendors
(and you can dream on about an Iksar selling for those kind of rates to
any NPC on Antonica) but you get exp... LOTS of exp at levels from
8 to 14.  Someone trying to level up quick can afford to take a small
loss, basically buying exp.  People in CB buy exp in the form of
CB belts all the time, paying more than five times what the quest rawhide
armor pieces will fetch sold to a vendor... the GLS quest, for some reason,
is desperately undervalued, so that a savvy purchaser can both make a
profit -and= massive exp on the deal.
