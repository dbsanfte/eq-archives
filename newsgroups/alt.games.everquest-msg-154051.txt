In a Multiplayer Universe, Gods Bow to the Masses
By SETH SCHIESEL


AUTE GODAGER has more power over his economy than Alan Greenspan,
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board does. He has more influence over
global politics than Kofi Annan, secretary general of the United
Nations. For the inhabitants of his world, Mr. Godager is nothing less
than an all-powerful god.

Of course, Mr. Godager's world does not really exist. And deities do
not have to worry about their universe's inhabitants' picking up and
leaving for a competing reality because they are dissatisfied with
their selection of weapons. Last week Mr. Godager was worrying about
just that.

His world is the planet Rubi-Ka in the year 29476. It is the universe
of Anarchy Online, part of the new breed of so-called massively
multiplayer online games that have helped transform the game industry.

Fans of massively multiplayer games like Anarchy Online and EverQuest
often spend dozens of hours a week in their virtual environments. In
exchange for the subscription fees they pay (Anarchy Online costs
$12.95 a month), players are vocal, active and sometimes downright
ornery in demanding consistency in their online economies and overall
balance in their digital worlds. If they do not like the way a game is
going, they vote with their feet (or their keyboards), cancel their
accounts and move.

That is what Mr. Godager, game director for Anarchy Online (www
.anarchy-online.com), confronted last week. A tentative alteration to
a set of rare and powerful game pieces called low-light targeting
scopes raised the threat of a mass uprising and widespread
cancellations by Anarchy Online players.

Funcom, the Norwegian company that runs Anarchy Online, does not
release subscriber figures, but analysts say that the game must have
at least tens of thousands of users. Last week many of them posted
irate messages on online bulletin boards and sent e-mail to Funcom in
protest, setting aside professional rivalries (Metaphysicists versus
Nano Technicians, for instance) and interspecies tensions (different
sorts of mutants do not always see eye to eye, literally).

"The way the people vote is by leaving the game, and we don't really
want that," Mr. Godager said in a telephone interview from Funcom's
offices in Oslo, sounding less like a god than like a junior
congressman besieged by lobbyists. "People have invested so much time
and effort into this and it's a big part of their life, and we were
trying to take all of this into consideration when we made this
decision for all of those people who feel like they own the game and
own the characters."

Mr. Godager faces the difficult task of making Anarchy Online's
virtual world as welcoming for newcomers as it is challenging for
addicts. As part of that effort, his team announced last week that it
was going to "nerf" the virtual low-light scopes, which increase the
chances of inflicting more damage on a target. In online parlance,
"nerf," after the soft, squishy real-life toys, means to make
something drastically less effective. In June, Funcom had decided that
no more would be created but that it would not disable the scopes that
already existed in the game.

That decision made the few remaining scopes extremely valuable. A
newcomer to Anarchy Online might play off and on for a month and
accumulate, say, 100,000 credits by killing monsters and selling
treasure found on the corpses. The most powerful scopes routinely sell
for 200 million credits or more, putting them far out of the reach of
all but the most dedicated players.

Some players - especially new ones who cannot afford the scopes - call
that situation unfair. The majority - particularly the hardcore
players who can think about buying the scopes - appear to believe that
Anarchy Online should operate as a market-based economy, meaning that
it is acceptable for luxury goods to be available only to the rich.
But many of those players complained that the latest change
contradicted the company's earlier statement that the scopes would
remain in the game.

"When a person devotes a lot of time and energy towards something, a
person tends to feel some sense of possession," Jen Kozar, a
high-level Anarchy Online player from Hawaii, wrote in an e-mail
interview last week. "The biggest problem with nerfs is that it can
take what a player did and invalidate it."

Mr. Godager said that in response to the outcry over the planned
changes, Funcom might scale back the adjustment in the scopes.

The players, meanwhile, say that in virtual worlds, as in real life, a
gap between rich and poor will persist.

"At low levels you barely manage to scrape by unless you have friends
in-game with higher-level characters that help you," a high-level
player known as Hayake said by e-mail last week. "At higher levels you
just keep on amassing funds, as there is nothing anymore that you can
spend them on."

"In an hour of playtime," Hayake wrote, "I probably leave more money
lying on the floor than a new character can make in a week of
playtime. Decadence rules at high levels, I guess."
