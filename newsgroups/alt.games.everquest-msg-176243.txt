Ok. I had a GM show up in response to a surname issue I was having and
I was floored by the armor his iksar was wearing. It was some dark
green plate-looking stuff that kind of gave the illusion of a space
suit or something the way the helm was completely enclosed and the
body pieces were a smooth uniform texture. It was *way* cool.

Can anyone tell me what this armor was? Was it maybe just some GM-only
gear? I was thinking he was probably a warrior or shadowknight. Some
names of types of armor it may have been would at least give me
something to look for in the Allakhazam's fashion tables.
