Its the same damn freakin reason I get GOBS AND GOBS of fucking (omg i
said fucking - i must really be pissed) junk email. That one clueless
fuck (out of thousands that get it) that gets the junk mail that says

makes it worthwhile to the scum that are spammers. Can you imagine how
much bandwidth is wasted by this Trash?!?!?!
