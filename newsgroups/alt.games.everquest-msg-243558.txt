Hit "send" too soon.

Another great place is Lower Guk.  The mobs near the zone-in are blue and
are again easy kills, even if the casters are annoying.  Beware, *all* the
frogs proc a root, so be prepared.  The great thing about LGuk is that as
your BL goes up in levels you can go deeper and deeper into the zone, still
finding mobs that give good XP.  Heck, when your BL hits 50 you can even
group with your cleric and both of you can get XP. =)
