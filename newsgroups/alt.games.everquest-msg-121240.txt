I also have never seen an NPC cast while moving, in fact I've used that
behavior to escape from caster mobs; using strafe run I'm barely faster
than a mob at all, but caster mobs keep pausing to cast, which slips them
further and further behind.

They do cheat, using very deep mana pools, very high channeling skill
for their level, never having to worry about lag interrupt (don't see them
stopping and spinning in place to make sure the server knows they
have stopped) but I've never seen them cast while moving... and since
I play a bard as my alt, I'm well aware of what an advantage casting while
moving can be!
