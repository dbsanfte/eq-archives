Try forest giants in Warsliks woods ,if your a good solo class,for the rare
forest loop drop(400pp) plus they will drop weapons that sell to merchants
for 40p and the ep is great. But the whole time I was there I never saw
it.Or try Unrest you can make like 100 plat worth in a few hours and once
again it is great ep.
