If you don't care what he thinks, why did you ask him?  You appear to want 
to know what people think as long as what they think fits in some small 
range of ideas that you've predetermined.  Unfortunately, ansswering in 
that small range would be predictable and boring, so people are less 
likely to answer that way.

As to your story:  That sucks if it's true.  But a warning on your account 
may not be as severe as you think.  But a GM told me not to tell you more 
than that, so I'm shutting up now.
