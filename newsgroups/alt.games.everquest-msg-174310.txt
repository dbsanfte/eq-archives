You can probably find tons of tips at Graffe's Wizard Board.  I don't know
the web address, but I bet a google search on "Graffe Wizard" would find it.
The idea is that you snare some mobs, then set yourself up so that as they
chase you they come together in a bunch.  You then start casting AoE damage
spells.  I think the reason for the magic number of 4 mobs is that a lot of
AoE spells will effect a maximu of 4 mobs.  For the same mana that you would
use to kill one mob, if you can kill 4 if you get them close together.
