Been there too and I understand. I played a melee only character as my first
and that made corpse runs that much harder.  Make sure you have a hot button
for LOC.  If you are far from home base and you get in trouble hit that
button so you will have a record of where your corpse is.  Get some maps
from EQAtlas and make sure you understand the the grid system and how LOC
works.

I always found 12-15 to be a little tricky because it does require you to
get out a bit, but it is a dangerous place out there.  Once you hit 15 there
are some wonderful places to group with other players.  You will also now
also have the skills/abilites to safely make it through most of the commonly
travelled zones.
