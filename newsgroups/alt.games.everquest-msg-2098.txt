Your analogy is wrong. Imagine the butcher has a sign saying "$X for 16
pieces of Steak" and this steak occupies 0.5 cubic feet of volume. However,
the butcher only has boxes of 1 cubic feet in volume because these are the
only boxes ever supplied to the butchering industry. Do you then complain
about the onions he adds to fill up the extra space? Apparently not. YOU
complain because the 16 steaks you agreed to buy haven't miraculously
transformed into 32 steaks....

Heck, now i'm reminded of the side of cereal packets. "This product is sold
by weight not by volume. Some settling of contents may have occured".

Storage campacity of the distribution medium is never a consideration in
games design beyond "is it big enough to hold everything?"

Well you said it yourself brainiac. "More than a floppy". What else are they
gonna sell it on? Write is on beermats? Once the added content goes over 3Mb
it HAS to be distributed on CD and a CD can hold approx 600Mb. I suggest you
go and take a look at the rest of your games collection and find out who
else has been ripping you off by not filling the entire 600Meg!!! It's a
conspiracy I tells ya!!!
