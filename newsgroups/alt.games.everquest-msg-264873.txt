Talk to any Priest of Discord, and he can transport you there if you say the
correct phrase.  (I forget the exact wording, but it's bracketed in the
text)  I wish to go to Discord, or something close to that.

Mobs in Drannik's Scar are high 40's I believe.    Bloodfields 55'ish,
Harbingers Spire 58'ish,  Nobles Causeway 61'ish.  The instanced dungeons in
Dranniks Scar scale to the level of the person initiating them.  Mobs will
be a few levels below the group leader's level.

I do not however see a lot of low level groups doing it, so you will likely
have to either be a solo class or have a regular group that is willing to go
different places.  Pickup groups are unlikely.
