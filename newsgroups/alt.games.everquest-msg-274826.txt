Your *post* was about the things you claim, but the thread was about
other things. Threads drift. Welcome to Usenet.

That's funny, because you rather missed some points yourself. Like,
don't circumvent a filter in a deliberate attempt to break the rules
of a game. And don't whine like a baby when you are caught and
punished for it. And don't look for sympathy from a community of
people who by and large understand what it means to be a responsible
participant in an online game.


>This thread was asking you how much censorship you like in your games

If I want to hear idiot children engage in what they think is the
height of clever insult through lame profanity, I can just step
outside and watch the local skateboarders. Or, read a Usenet thread.
When I'm paying to play an online game, part of what I'm paying for is
the opportunity to escape the real world, and some of the stupidity
that comes with it. I guess that translates to "I like censorship of
you idiot children just fine".

And in one sentence, you completely void your claims that the thread
isn't (or shouldn't be) about definitions. I expect you won't
understand that, though.

You seem to be implying they banned you to reduce server load. That's
absurd.

This wasn't unjustice. Nor was it injustice. This was Blizzard
enforcing their rules, in an effort to provide a pleasant gaming
experience for the majority of their customers. Thanks for making me
aware that they're not afraid to thump idiots like you on the head
when you step out of line.
