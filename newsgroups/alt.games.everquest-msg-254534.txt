Some things in custom UIs I find invaluable:

As a healer, having an HP% next to each users bar is a big A+ for me.
Having a clear Buff and Song window means I can put it to one side and
get more screen when I am not buffed to the gills.
Being able to see my regular and AA exp in % and bars under my l is a
mixed blessing ;) Having smaller buttons and a trimmed down UI is good for
me too.

Different strokes for different blokes I guess :)
