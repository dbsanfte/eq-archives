Already happening. Many people are rerolling on the non pvp servers already. 
Makes sense, it has been over 6 years since UO first came out. Many people 
thus would have no idea how annoying constant griefing pvpers can be.

I really like how wow throws you some pvp curves . I have already ganked 
several horde , and just know they where doing something they werent 
supposed to be :) (In wow attacking the opposing forces npcs flags you as 
pvp for like 5 minutes and thus opens you up to anyone on the opposite side 
who wants to flag himself for 5 minutes to kill you , also just walking into 
some zones flags you; I recently had a nice running battle with a horde 
warrior and hunter after investigating the undercity )
