OT is excellent territory for a low-30s beastlord, yea.

I would continue mostly soloing tho, that's definitely the most efficient
use of a BSTs time until at least lvl44. For one thing, a beastlord is the
best solo class in the game through the 20s and 30s.

Starting at 44 I would switch heavily into LDON adventuring. At 44 you get
your first "kittycrack" (Spiritual Light), which is the first key step in
your growth as a group class. Gradually from that point you become a
slowing/hasting class and a more useful buffing class in addition to the
group mana/HP regens, such that by the time you are in the mid-50s a
beastlord is damned powerful for LDON play. Also for similar exp grouping
(like a group that is working its way through a regular dungeon or a Tier 1
plane or whatever).
