    mmm well the wizzies never got agro that I recall, much harder to keep
it off the shammy and necros I've noticed ;)

    What I meant to say was that sustained wizzy damage at that level is
quite low with normal person gear. I was taking a seat of the pants average
based on 20ish fights I looked at where the SK+pet usually out damaged
either wizard, and when he didn't, it was by a small margin.

    Yeah, DPS in a BP-AOE group thats working must be something awe
inspiring to see. How a log parser would cope with the data is another
question ;)

    Never been in one, but definitely something I hope to see in action
before my EQ career is over :)

    Indeed, and it's something that melee newbie guides need to hammer home
because most seem to have no idea that when you're not tanking, standing
behind the mob noticeably increases your dps! I had never heard of the idea
until I started reading this NG.

    Totally situational again. For non AOE non quadding groups the class I'd
generally pick above any other would be shaman. Very nice DPS on their own,
and stack well with either casters or melees.
