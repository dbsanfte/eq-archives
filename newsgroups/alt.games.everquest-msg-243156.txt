Well, there's a million zillion oracle servers run by a skillion different 
companies.  And there's a whole separate company (cleverly named 'Oracle') 
that those companies can turn to if things go wrong for help and guidance.  
And there's a whole army of people with 3 years experience running Oracle 
servers that can be hired to troubleshoot for those companies.

Contrarilywise, there's only one company running Everquest servers.  When 
they have trouble, they don't generally have outside help to turn to, 
since they wrote the code.  There are many fewer people trained to work on 
Everquest servers.  In fact, almost all ones outside the company who have 
been so trained used to work there, and so are unlikely to appear as a new 
hire.

Now, if the EQ division of Sony was as big as say, Oracle, and had as much 
financial resources, sure, you might have a point.  Even then it'd be 
pretty iffy though.
