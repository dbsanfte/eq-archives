I love my husband dearly, and we both play eq...but he plays on his own, 
i think i have grouped with him or run across him in game maybe 15 times 
in 2 years...i spend more time with my game husband. Not to say  I 
would't be willing to help him, or power level him, but he realizes that 
with him playing a 22 monk, and me playing a 56 cleric grouping isnt 
really going to happen, and he is not a fan of powerleveling. [he was in 
the navy, so his game time was seriously curtailed by duties. retired 
now, and he gets to play a lot more now=)] He would probably be just as 
happy playing on a different server as the same one we are on.
