I'm not one of our tailors, so I can't give you a real answer. I expect (but
won't guarantee) that you can get a discount if you bring the supplies. But
even if you supplied EVERYTHING it would be fair that the craftsperson place
a charge to reflect her expertise, especially given the (for non-cultural
tailoring) high trivials for the Wu pieces.
