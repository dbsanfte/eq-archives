They also have higher hp regen than you're likely to be used to.  When
I've solo'd a Druid in Dulak I found it best to stack my top three
swarm dots on the mobs as their regen really cuts into DoT efficiency.
They also have annoyingly high magic resistence and hit pretty hard
when you're wearing leather colored tissue paper in place of armor, so
I pulled with Ensnare (Snare would not always last long enough).  The
one thing that's fairly easy about Gunthak/Dulak is the small mob agro
radius, it's pretty easy to single pull in a lot of places.  And it is
outdoor so Harmony (in Gunthak) and Harmony of Nature (in Dulak, enough
mobs are over 40 and you don't get a mob too high message from Harmony)
work, and you can use wolfform to improve the odds of escape when good
old Murphy stops by for a visit.
