Here's some more remedial math in the form of a word problem or two:

1.  A razorfiend subduer starts with 64,000 hit points at full health.
He currently has 245 hit points left and is enraged:
   a.  Using whole numbers only, what percentage of health does he
have left?
   b.  How many seconds will the n00b who hasn't figured out the
answer to 1(a) last as he eats enrage? (Hint: Both questions have the
same answer.)

2.  Thought Horror Overfiend starts with 2.2 million hit points at
full health. He's down to 9,450. What percentage of melees miss the
loot call because they went afk at engagement and have subsequently
forgotten they were playing EQ tonight or dozed off?
