A few items in the 3-13-03 patch message in error.
Skyshrine, the Plane of Sky and the Great Divide did not get patched 
with the last patch. Because of that, the following items from the patch 
message did not make it Live.

- Sentry Rotiart now enacts his role in his quest properly.
- Beastlord pets can now be summoned in the Plane of Sky.
- The teleporter from the Great Divide to the Plane of Knowledge will 
now work during Coldain Ring War.

We'll patch these zones with the next patch and get these changes out. 
We're sorry about the error and the delay on these updates.
