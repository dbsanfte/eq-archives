    Well, one guild tried exactly that. And this is what happened to them:

    Explicit tries Creator. Explicit dies to Creator, and starts ressing in
the hallway right outside the room to try again. Wraith starts sending
people up to take Creator, but find their way blocked by a naked ogre in a
small doorway (go go small halls!) Wraith petitions, a GM comes to
arbitrate. GM rules in favour of Explicit, which is after all right beside
the mob and about to go again. Wraith's negotiator gets lippy, then does a
/q when told they must allow Explicit the next shot. GM gets angry, Wraith
is booted from Ssra for 24 hours by the GM (and on a patch day, too), and
everyone else on the server laughs at Wraith.
