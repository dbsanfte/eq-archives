Group spells can be used on them, it's just a waste of mana 'cause you
are basically using /targetgroupbuff on a single player.
One warning so - pets are not subject to "rejecting" non-stacking
buffs.  A lot of "you can stack buffs x, y and z" nonsense came around
from people confimring they are all listed by "pet health".  Pets
stack the buff spells, but ignore non-stacking effects. E. g. haste
and shaman pet haste stack, but the pet haste has no additional
affect.
The only buffs I usually put on my pets are HP buffs and haste. 
Resist buffs are useless since the pet resist change, most people have
higher resists then their pets, so the pet uses the player resist.
Other stat buffs are pretty much useless, str for example does not
effect the maximal hits of pets.
