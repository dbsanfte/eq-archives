Try this...

1)  Start the patcher and let it download any new files but DO NOT hit play
yet
2) Goto your Everquest directory (in my case it was C:\program
files\everquest) and delete the file EQNEWS.TXT
3) close that window and go back to the Patcher screen......Hit PLAY
4) Enjoy the new upgrades


Worked for me, I got right in
