I hit the same snag last week. Lost 30k worth of items when the Bazaar
went down as I was doing a transfer to my mule on a 2nd account. A
regular GM couldn't find any logs of what I lost (his words) but
sending an e-mail to customer service got me a reply to please get in
touch with a customer service GM. Dunno if he'll be able to help me or
not but the fact that they didn't turn me down after I specified in my
e-mail that a regular GM couldn't help me, does imply that CS has some
other info at their disposal when it comes to lost items.
