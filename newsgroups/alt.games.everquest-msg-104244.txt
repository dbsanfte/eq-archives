hehe, we have a hot thread going here.
Here is my philosophy on /ooc.
First off when someone is spaming go ahead and /petition it, but also
/report if and it will send like the last 10 lines from that person in.
That way if nobody is on to handl it right then it will be reviewed and the
person will get a talking to next time they are on.
I believe that it is okay to say hi to someone in the zone over /ooc and
then switch the conversation over to /tell.  This is useful when you see
someone you havn't for along time and you are not sure if they want to chat
or if the person has just auctioned and you don't want to confuse them when
they might be getting alot of tell.
Finally /ooc is good for chat that is ment to involve anyone in the zone if
they want to participate in it.  Being a bard I will sometimes,if zone is
quiet, /ooc a few lyrics to a song just to get some converstaion started.
One time in Everfrost had a conversation going on about coffee for about 1/2
hour just because I /ooc'ed Ahhh Coffee.  It was a fun conversation for the
zone.  It is in bad form to carry on a conversation with a person that is
not for everyone to join in.
My pet peive is the people who do the lfg ever 30 seconds or so.  Geeze,
wait till someone new zones in.
