Ok .. tried to join several guilds recently, all to prove either
to be just people outside my timezone or crumbling fast because
of whatever internal trouble with some emotional people.
The question is: What guilds can you name that:

- are big and stable. This means a LOT of people online a lot
  
- are more or less also european. This means many people of
  CET timezone available in weekday evenings for raids etc

- will accept a 50 shaman. If I have to become 55 first, no
  problem

- contains friendly people. I noticed that some guilds have
  way more socializing, nice people than others. I have no
  interest in some arrogant guild with bad reputation,
  where everybody shouts and behaves moronic on raids and
  loot.


Any suggestions? So far I thought of Legendary or maybe the
Companions .. I dunno, that's just the only big ones that
came to my mind.
