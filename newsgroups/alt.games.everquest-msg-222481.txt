I'll agree to that to an extent. Giving up fatherhood is no small 
sacrifice either (indeed to a 'true beleiver in heaven' it could well be 
one of the greatest sacrifices, particularly in this case as becoming a 
father was a very high point in Abes life) but the pulpit masters 
usually spin it differently.

going off on a tangent here: complete and absolute 
omniscience/omnipotence is a paraodoxical mess if you try apply it to 
biblical teachings.

Moreover it blows free-will out of the wate. And without free will, you 
will never be in a position where you actually make a moral choice. So.. 
agreed.
