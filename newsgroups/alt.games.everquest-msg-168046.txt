You've been fed some bull on one point and are correct on the other.

The "safe spot" you zone to in SG is up next to the WW zone line. There
are usually a couple of walrus type creatures who are static spawns
standing there, but they are non-aggro to default faction and not an
issue. However there is one mob (enraged bulthork or somesuch) that
paths right through that area. If he comes by or is there when you pop
in, he will aggro and the other mobs will aggro to his defense. However,
that's generally still not an issue because unless you get chain
stunned, you can run the ten steps to the zone line and escape to WW
alive.

As to where you can succor/evac, I've zoned in and immediately cast it
on myself without taking another step when I was in a hurry, so that's
crap.
