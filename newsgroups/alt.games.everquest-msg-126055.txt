I play on 2 different laptops from time to time.  Mainly to log on a
'shared' druid for self-ports.

My reliable ol' Toshiba Tecra 8100 with a PIII 750 and 384mb:  The
mighty S3 video card pretty much blows in this thing, but is just good
enough with EVERYTHING turned off/down and old models.  It worked
wonderfully back in the pre SoL days, but SoL kinda kicks its butt.

My new toy, the HP Omnibook XE3.  Just picked this one up last week
(barely used).  Also has 384, soon to be 512mb and a Celery 933.  Uses
some on board Intel video thingy with shared memory and all, but man
does it look a lot better than the Toshiba.  Running low detail, a few
new models and is *very* smooth.  Suspect once I get it to 512 I can
turn on some more models.  Very pleased with how it runs EQ
considering what I paid (and why I bought it, of course [not for EQ])

Hmm.. what was my point?  Not much I guess, but you don't HAVE to pay
the premium for the onboard GF cards if you're not terribly picky.
Granted, if its gonna be your full-time machine and you do a LOT of
gaming, then by all means - get the geforce units.  If not, why spend
all the extra money?
