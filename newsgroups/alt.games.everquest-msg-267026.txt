The quick and dirty version is in the types of spells they get.  Cleric 
classes will get mostly outright heals (fast & expensive, or slow and 
efficient).  Druids on the other hand get fewer heals, but more 
regeneration/heal over time spells.  Shammys will get Wards that prevent 
damage in the first place.
The offensive spells differ too, but I'm afraid I can't remember the details 
off the top of my head.
