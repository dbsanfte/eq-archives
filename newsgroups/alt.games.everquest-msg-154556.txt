And if he'd been punished for it I would have looked further into what
happened.  However, like I said, when I checked back, everything
seemed to have been worked out.  I assume that my friend *thought* he
was in trouble because of the conversation, but worked it out with the
GL.  We have a message board our GL frequents, with a special section
for policies.  If he decides to post that we should avoid certain mobs
- well, *then* I'll reconsider my guild application.
