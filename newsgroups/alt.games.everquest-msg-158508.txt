Again, you're missing the point. If you don't buy one of the expansions 
which enable you to level past 50 then yes, you won't be able to attend 
higher level raids. However, by not buying the expansion and having 
never been past 50 you are still not losing out on anything you have 
been able to do before the expansions were released. So effectively you 
can keep doing what you were doing irrespective of expansion releases.

Now, with the PoP expansion they have included a raid feature which 
makes raiding a LOT easier. This means everyone with PoP will insist on 
using the feature when raiding. This means when enough people have PoP 
then raids will REQUIRE players to have PoP so the raid participants can 
use the new raid feature. This means that players WITHOUT PoP will be 
PREVENTED from attending raids because THEY DO NOT HAVE PoP!

See my point?
