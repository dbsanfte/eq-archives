I'd settle for just randomizing spell agro a bit. Either have monsters
that have lower (or higher) modifiers when EQ determines how much agro
any given spell gives. What if slow caused higher agro when cast on a
warrior mob or heals caused higher agro if a healer mob sees it cast? 

Other option would be just to randomize how much agro any given spell
causes. Lets say that currently, darkness has 800 agro and slow has
700, that means that I can always cast slow with an SK tanking and
never, ever have to worry about taking agro. What if darkness had
rand(0, 1600) agro and Slow had rand(0, 1400)? Suddenly there's at
least a chance that the mob might come after me when I try to slow it.


It wouldn't be adding intelligence to the mobs but it would keep the
easier camps a bit more interesting and random. Not sure how it would
affect raids but I'd love to see it on exp mobs. I get the feeling
that most players wouldn't though.
