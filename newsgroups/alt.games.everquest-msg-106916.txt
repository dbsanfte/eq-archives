On the front of my Velious box it says clearly "International Credit Card
Required".  This was bought in the UK.  On my US boxed Triloty set which I
purchased for my son it states on the back in capitals "Valid Credit Card
Required".   My Luclin package also states the same.

I can't locate the orginal EQ boxes whch I got for my first account so can't
verify those.
