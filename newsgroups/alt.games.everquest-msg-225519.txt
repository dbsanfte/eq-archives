This is a great solution, first I've seen it suggested.

Its still not perfect, though, because you can start casting, then have 
someone else land their spell or missile or melee blow or even prox 
aggro -before- your spell finishes casting, unless its insta click, in 
which case you can't tie it to a hotkey such as this as far as I know.

Faster casting your pull spell is the less likely this is to be a 
problem, and at any rate, using this key represents a very sincere 
effort to check before starting your pull.

Is there a hotkey command for archery or throwing weapons?

Pulling with Cancel Magic... which would be particularly rude if it hit 
a snared or rooted mob someone else was working on!
