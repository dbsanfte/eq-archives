Reverse kiting allows you to do something that neither root/DOT nor
snare DD so... melee damage.

Snare, Fear, and chase it down pounding on it.  Since the only
spells you have to cast are some fears and one or two snares,
running out of mana isn't really an issue.

You are at the whim of pathing though, you can't really control
where the target is going to go.  Best plan is to drag to a zone line like
those in GD, EW, Overthere... snare and run to zone, then fear and
chase it back up the long roamer free tunnel.  When fear breaks
run it back to the zone line before re applying fear.  If this isn't
possible where you are hunting, some trial and error will be needed
to find where they path and where the roamers are that might add.

Also, as a druid, melee isn't really your long suit.  Reverse kiting
is usually a group activity (except for necros, who's pets do
the melee part of the job.) where you get some real tanks in
who get all the free hits making the whole thing all the more
mana efficient.  Rogues especially make excellent partners
for this, what they can do with a back thats always turned is
just outrageous.

The other benefit of reverse kiting is that it, like root, makes
your DOTs take full effect.  A mob that is chasing someone
takes only 2/3rd the DOT damage that one which is standing
still or running away does.  If you have the mana to root dot
something to death you should also have mana to fear dot it...
although both break often enough that this isn't really a good
plan in the lower levels.  If you -are- reverse kiting and the
mob is going to take a while to die, tossing in a DOT will
get you more damage for the mana than a DD would.
