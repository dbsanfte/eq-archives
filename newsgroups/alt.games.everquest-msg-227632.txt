Well, as long as you get what *you* want then. Screw anyone out for 
anything they can use to improve their gear, huh?

I can follow it just fine. I just can't stand people who skew the facts 
for effect in a cheap attempt to bolster their case, or put everything in 
terms of how they themselves prefer to play and consider it gospel.

It's one thing to speak up and say that you like NBG because of a 
particular way that it works for you. To each their own. It's quite 
another to fight tooth and nail to discount the benefits of /random just 
because it doesn't fit into that perfect little personal scenario of 
yours.

Please feel free to rebut, but I'm finished here. This has become quite 
counter-productive. Thanks for your contributions.
