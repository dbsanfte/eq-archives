Verant posted that there seems to be an issue with AMD's floating point
thing.  I'm not a coder...every time someone attempts to explain the
floating point thing to me I drift off to a pleasant sleep, and I'm at work
right now, so please don't explain it, I can live without the info. :)

Jazz posts that his not-great Pentium zones in 14 seconds (I'm assuming that
"all continents besides Velious" includes the non-continent of Luclin) and
AMDs zone in over a minute.  Ouch.  Do you have an AMD as well?
