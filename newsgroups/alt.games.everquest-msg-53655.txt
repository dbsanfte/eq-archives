Yeah I know.  But the thing is, I fell to his level at Highpass, not when I
petitioned.  IMO if you're going to push the naming policy, you should stay
off the GM's radar.  Pull a bonehead and guess what happens?

No different, except its done by one guy.  I'm actually amazed at the skill
level involved in getting druid up to the high 40s in such a short time,
then actually being able to twink (yes on FV) a lvl 18 enchanter with gear I
can't hope to get unless I get into a decent guild and am willing to pour in
some major playing time.   <-- No I'm not jealous, I'm just astounded.  I
know that people will say, "Yeah well, if you play 24/7 anyone can do that."
I don't think *I* can with a clear 24/7 schedule.
