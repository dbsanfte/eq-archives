I don't think I've ever been in PoK for more than 2 mins and not seen
someone asking in OOC for a port.  My Druid is a port bot and sees
almost no playtime other than this (2-3 hours/week tops) but still
gets asked for ports at least every 10 minutes in busy places like PoK
and Nexus.

Example: last time he was logged in was to take a friend to buy a
Drogmor, we'd just finished the transaction so I /ooc "Heading to
Nexus if anyone wants a lift" and two people immediately sent tells;
one of them offered a Defender's Lightblade as payment and the other
50pp.  I turned them down as I was heading that way anyway but that's
not a bad return for someone who needed the cash.

Of course if you're perma-ANON you'll probably not get asked very
often.
