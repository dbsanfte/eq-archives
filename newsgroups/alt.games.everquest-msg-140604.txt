I only used America as the example as the poster was commenting on a US
scenario.

Being poor in the countries you mentioned above generally means only having
one TV, a shitbox car and living in a trialer park. Being completely down
and out generally means your out on the street and lining up in soup
kitchens between drunken binges.

Being poor in a lot of other countries means watching your children die of
malnutrition helplessly.

Again, I fail to see the grounds for legitimate complaint. A job goes in one
field creates a job in another one, if someone is not prepared to adapt then
the show just goes on without them. No loss. If a complete clusterfuck like
myself can manage to keep meaningful employment then I can only assume
others are not trying very hard or are not prepared to adapt.
