Yeah - that dawned on me when I looked again and they were green :)
I never realized they were so cheap.

Duh - of course (/bonks himself on the

If I play him - this needs to be something
with more AC.  Bronze at a minimum.

Definitely needs replacing - Strawspun
should be really cheap.  Save up for spider
fur.

Ahhh - of course I should have realized.
my only melee since SoL is my BL and never got
one of these for him.

hmmm - don't remember.  I noticed that Symphonic Sabers
are pretty cheap in the bazaar the other day, that might
be it.

Being an AC/HP junkie I'd change a couple of things - but in the
main VERY playable.  With maxed fighting/singing skills and Sense
Heading - he's ready to run :)

I know I want a character on Test to play when my friends aren't
on - now I just have to decide:

I really liked the gear for the BL, the Bard (both kittys) and
the SK (not sure - probably make a lizard)
