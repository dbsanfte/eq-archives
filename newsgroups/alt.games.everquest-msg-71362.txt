You know I should check out the daoc newsgroup and see if anyone
posts there about how many things daoc ripped from EQ.

90% of EQ was ripped from MUDs and AD&D and 90% of daoc
was ripped from EQ but when EQ rips from daoc its pointed at like
its something that's not obvious or a revelation.

EQ is responding to competition and altering the game for the better.
All I can say is "Duh"
