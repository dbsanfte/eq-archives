You got a 63 Wizard and havent got a clue about nukes? Can anyone say
ebay...?
Isos is better than the Draught of Ro, but it cannot be chain cast. Also at
63, use the Ice damage enhancer spell and use Isos.. it rocks. You should
read up a little before you post such nonsense and admitt to yourself that I
am Uber.
