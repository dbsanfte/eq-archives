Yes, that works, but it has been overdone to death and it screams "troll"
like a deaf person talking in a public library. You would have to come up
with a pretty original crosspost list to achieve any originality and not
just rely on the standard format of "alt.law-enforcement.interpol" -
"alt.underage.sex.tourist" - "alt.games.everquest" format.

The trick of trolling is of course to be offensive thus bait a response, but
if you trigger peoples "sense of troll awareness" then the smart people
refrain from replying for the same reason you don't reward a monkey with a
banana for smearing shit all over your wall.  Crossposting attempts to drive
and explosive laden semi trailer over peoples "sense of troll awareness" so
you have to be rather inventive for it to still work. For example, if the
said monkey was a cute little spider monkey and instead smeared shit all
over your visiting mother inlaw, it would be understandable to reward it
with a who dang bunch of bananas.
