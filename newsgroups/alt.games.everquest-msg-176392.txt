The truth is, in my email field in Outlook, I use joe@noname.com for my
email address (obviously fake).  Busterboo was pissed off at me and dug up a
post by someone else entirely who used (Joe@noname.com) as their email
address.  Ignoring the capital letter in the one address where there is none
in the other, as well as the fact that the similarity in the two addresses
was pure coincidence, the dumbass posted it as if it were fact in several
newsgroups, including this one.  I am still not sure if the oversight was
intentional or due to abject stupidity on Busterboo's part, as both
explanations are plausible.

In any case, the accusation is false.
