My shadow knight did her first experiments with pets last night. The
pet wasn't taunting, but if I needed a small break to cast a spell, I
just had to take a small step back and the mob would be chewing on
poor Jarn (I knew him well) instead of me. Don't know if it used to be
that easy for a level 9 SK to distract a mob.
