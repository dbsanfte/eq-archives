Heh, my 35 mage has 4pp to his name right now :)

He has about 400-500 pp worth of gear and his
focus items (gems alone cost ~400)  Plus I gave
300pp worth of stuff and plat to a RL friend to
help him catch up, and have all my 39 spells in
the bank.

So, in all I've made 1500pp + the cost of spells
through 39.  Not a lot, but then, I don't focus on
loot much.  I figure that when I get higher I'll have
trouble not making cash,and mages aren't
equipment dependent.
