Since druids and shaman get SHeal as well, its hard to say its class
defining... but you have a point.  When clerics get this heal it
puts them at the "this is a healer everyone else better find another
job" level, while when the other classes get it its "well the cleric
is busy using his real heals on the important people, maybe I
should mem my pathetic SHeal and try to keep the "also ran" alive.

SHeal at 34 is very different from SHeal at 51
