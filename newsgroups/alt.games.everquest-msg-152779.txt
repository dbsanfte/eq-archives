First off, it's in Beta. It would be a Very Rare occasion to see 4
Jedi's together any time soon after release, considering how difficult
becoming a Jedi is. These guy were more that likely made Jedi's to see
game play.

Why not it is Loot.

You still need to interact, you what alone go play Diablo.

Still Morons who lose their bodies, This is strange considering the
Cloning Save feature, wouldn't think you'd need to find your body.

SWG


No LVL system, only gain exp and not the EQ type.
Where in EQ can you be a doctor or own a bar.
Since when in EQ can you run for a Political Office and be Mayor of
your town.
You actually get better and making Weapons just by having people that
bought your weapons use them.

the list goes on and on and on......
