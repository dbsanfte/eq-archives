Try /gu

And /g is group.

I amuse my friends by typing 
/g Hi there!
on instant messager all the time.
I just leave my window on /say.

Oh and r starts a reply with the name of the last person who sent you a
tell, and tab lets you cycle through the last folks to have sent you
tells. So when Abillsilidi sends you a tell, and then Dieiillei sends
you a tell, you don't have to swear profilically while trying to send a
response.
