If I desire to kill a mob I either do it or fail.  Then based on my
failures I either "adopt adapt and improve" (10 points for getting the
reference <g>) or reassess my desire.  I have never sought out ubers
that I might find their method of success as to me finding the method is
the game, not going through the motions that someone else came up with.

Yes, I would imagine they would, but I was here first.  If VI had held
to the beliefs as originally stated as being the core of EQ before there
even was a was a VI, ubers would have come and gone very quickly with
little damage to that original ideal.  The game as described by the
developers in those days of pre alpha would have driven them to greener
pastures where ubers might grow fat grazing upon phat lewt. Rather, the
powers that be rode their cash cow all the way to the slaughterhouse and
what remains is merely the stinking carcass of what might have been.  By
catering to the weak they created the ubers,  by not holding to their
original intent they sacrificed integrity for cash.  No, on second
thought, there is no way the ubers are as rightfully bitter about the
whole thing as I am <g>.

When beta was very young and there were no guilds I was one of the very
few who left the safety of Blackburrow and the Commonlands and hunted
those empty spaces where one rarely found  another soul in the zone.  I
died and learned how not to die and eventually convinced my friends to
join me on these great expeditions into what then was the unknown. 
Together we conquered the very things that kept most others safely at
home.  Jealous yet?
