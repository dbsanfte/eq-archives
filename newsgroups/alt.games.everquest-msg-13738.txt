I must have missed the post where she said she was wrong--could you give a
quote or a lin please?

Hell, if she has admitted the error of her ways, there is no longer nay reason
to keep flooding the thread with extrinsic sources that show how screwed up her
position was.

I make no claims to be a nice person.

Oh, here are some links on the subject of getting passwords with a sniffer:

Download your "high-tech" sniffer here.

Interesting quote: 

Sniffers

One of the biggest innovations in hacker technology is the password sniffer.
The idea is quite simple. Data on the Internet is broken down into packets,
which are sent from one system to the next until they reach their destination.
Anyone who can sit on a system anywhere along the route the packets take can
sift through them looking for ones that interest him. When a user connects to a
system, the first thing he must do is log in. The name of the host he's
connecting to, his account name and his password are all sent in the first few
packets. All the hacker needs to do is grab those first few packets and he has
everything he needs to access the account.

If the users are only using their local accounts this is no problem; since the
hacker needs root access to do his sniffing, he doesn't really need the
passwords of local users. But many users have multiple accounts, and frequently
go from one to the other as needed. This means that if the hacker and user are
on host A, and the user telnets to host B, the hacker (using his sniffer) now
has the user's password to host B. Now that he's on host B he can try to get
root and set up a sniffer there too.

The hyper-connected nature of the Internet makes it very convenient for users
to hop from system to system. But many of them never realize they're bringing
along an uninvited guest.

1996 FBI article on the increasing rise in the use of computers to commit
crime, along with an overview of sniffers being used. I guess the more things
change...

In order to stop this "non-existant" form of attack, government and industry
have started to use dynamic passwords that require hardware and passwords that
change every minute.

One of the websites for the hackers out there attacking, well, I'll let you
figure out which game it is they like to attack...

Enjoy reading about this mythical threat!

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
