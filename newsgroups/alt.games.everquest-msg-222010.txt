This was long after the level cap got moved to 60, late Velious era
when Fear really should've been trivial. I was part of the original
break crew and you knew it was gonna be a long day when the first
person to zone in eats a death touch from across the zone. Ended up
watching 2 good mid tier guilds wipe trying to do a CR and a 3 group
break crew from Bristlebane's resident uber-guild do the same. Just
one of those times when the mobs in Fear don't ever seem to loose
chain agro for some reason. As soon as one mob is agro'd half the zone
comes down on you. 

Finally ended up with about 50 people from the top two guilds rushing
the place with enough clerics so that they could click casualties
faster than the mobs were killing them. A zerg-fest in the true sense
of the word <g>.

On the bright side, death at 65 means a lot less than death at 20th
lvl used to.  Heck we all make mistakes, I came real close to wiping a
LDoN group this weekend through a really stupid move on my part. I'm
sure if it had been a pickup group we woulda wiped and people would've
been complaining about that damn shaman in their guild chat. 

I do tend to be a lot more forgiving with screwups when it's someone I
know than some random guy in a pickup group which really isn't fair.
