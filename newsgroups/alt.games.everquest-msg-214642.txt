Alright, after spending last night running around gettin my Stone, and
sitting waiting for one group to form which eventually disbanded
because the High Elf Cleric didn't like the Necromancer or some damn
thing, and bing outright rejected for being 'too low' for the only
other group forming around my level, I wasn't terribly impressed.

Made another try tonight, and got lucky.  Put on the old LFG tool and
some players gave me a shout from 3 zones away.  "Be right there."
They were waiting on a cleric, so it wasn't that big a deal.  Formed
up, got a port to South Ro and we were in!  Nice n easy.  Had the
'kill 50 mob thing" which was probably gonna be easy.  Sure enough, we
started walking through single and double pulls.  Made the 50 with 40
min to spare.  

Loved the dungeon, loved the new orcs in the Rujarkian hills.  Left
the Chests til last and got nothing much out of them, save for a
Goblin Pet (?!?!) and a Group Heal(?!?!), which was pretty cool.  Only
found one trap, which I couldn't seem to disarm,.  Loot was pretty
good.  made about 8 playt on the split, and we got 4 Augs amongst the
kills.  Seemed to be pretty random what they dropped off though.  Won
one too!  Woo-hoo!

Also made a level, 2 yellow in about 60 min isn't too bad.  The 'Kill
50' mission is like a forced XP crawl.  You don't have to worry about
respawns, but you know there's going to be at least 50 mobs there with
no killstealing going on.  A dedicated group could probably repeatedly
grind some decent XP this way (Everything in the dungeon was DB to
me).

So all in all, I was hooked.  Depsite the Cleric master-looter skating
with all the drops (cept for the augs which we rolled as we went)
after getting the win.  Doh!  Still, very enjoyable overall.  I think
I'm hooked.
