AFAIK, attack values are all multiples of 5, since they are the "new report"
for the "cryptic" old values of Vengeance, which was labelled I-X ....but
anyway....

attack + 10, for example, means that the ATK rating (under HP, under AC,)
will go up by 10 ... you won't notice the difference

if you round up a good amount of +attack items, little by little, you'll
notice you can connect with your opponent more often, and your hits will
more often toward the higher end of your personal spectrum (if your max is
100, you won't hit for 105, you'll just hit for closer-to-100 more often)

if you really want to try it out, get some ranger buffs and see...attack is
like dex, but better =)
