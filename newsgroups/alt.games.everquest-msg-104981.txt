    I'm guessing Icewell Keep and Kael are the first two zones so changed.

    So now mages can remove slow effects from their pets again, and more. A
very neat enhancement.

spellbook

    There's someone with druid ancient spells?

druids)

    Heh, even when the druids managed to find a way to get Temple of Sol Ro
armour, it has to be taken away from them.

> - Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood proc effect is now level restricted

    Because having level 1 twinks with an 80 DD proc ruined the game! I
still need to get one for my 45 warrior, to replace the Velium Short Blade
she uses.

> - NPCs in Sanctus Seru no longer show fear (or are affected by such
spells)

    Heh, I can imagine fear kiting Lord Inquisitor Seru before this change.
:-)

    These updates have been a lot of fun. Anyone know if any other newbie
zones have been updated on Test?
