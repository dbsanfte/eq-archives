The quest is still in place, however, the stonebrunt forage table is screwed
up.  In 2 hours, with 200 foraging, I got NOTHING except generic
vegetables/fruit/berries/pod of water/ etc.  and yes I know that the bamboo
looks like roots and the palm fruit looks like berries/fruit, believe me, I
force fed enough of them on accident.  I had my remaining 2 of each forage
that I got WAY back when the zone was new and have had in the bank since
then, they were in the bottom of my inventory, so they wouldn't get eaten,
and after 2 hours, with no force feeding except off verified stacks of food
in my inventory:

Palm Fruit forages: none
Bamboo shoot forages: none

So, the quest IS still there (I just did it with my old supplies a week or
two ago), but the forages are NOT.

Also, there's the rumour that they are now ground spawns, I'm fairly sure
this is false, because in that 2 hours, I did a lot of running around, and
saw nothing on the ground (well, except the fishing grubs I had been
dropping).
