My level 25 NEC has finally reached skill lvl 40.
It seems most of the words I find are for MAGs or for higher lvl NEC spells.
I know I will get fails with the High NEC words, but I was wondering if I 
can do the MAG researched words and then sell them?
If so, it will not matter as much if the research fails as I do not need the 
spell anyway, plus by raising my skill level, I would not fail as much with 
the spells that do matter to me.
TIA
