Except that Rand is the GL and Mat is a senior officer in a guild with
hundreds of thousands of members, their experience is not relevant to
any but a very few EQ players.  If you want a better comparison for
very nearly all EQ players try the soldiers who routinely threw dice
(everybody /random) and/or drew lots (leader /random) for loot IRL as
well as in most of the best epic fiction.
