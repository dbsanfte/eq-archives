Ok just got to get it off my chest.  I recieved EverQuest for christmas and
as soon as I started to play my children wanted to play too.  Within a few
days it was obvious that we were all goin to play this game.  I soon found
out that I had to buy a set of disks for each computer and create a new
account for each family member who wants to play.

It would be nice if there were a family account plan of some sort.  At least
then I wouldn't have 4 accounts and monthly charges to keep up with.

Now I know it was on the agreement that I click on when I start to play (but
who reads that %$&* anyway) but I can't believe that I cannot allow anyone
else to play a character on my account.  Anyone know the reasoning behind
this?  So guess what kids? Mommie gets to play but you have to get your own
account.

OK neither of their computers were compatible with the program, so some
upgrades were in order.  About $400 later we are ready to play.  NOT
including new software and account charges.  In the meantime, they really
wanted to play so I let them play on my account.

Now we all have our own accounts and I have to pay $50 to transfer my
daughters character to her account!  What a ripoff!

I'm not trying to pull a scam here.  Come on-I am investing a lot of money
so that my family can all play this game.  In a little over a month we have
set up FOUR accounts and purchased FOUR sets of software.  I'm paying to
play here....

Please cut this family some slack!
