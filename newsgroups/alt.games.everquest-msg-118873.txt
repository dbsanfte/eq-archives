RP-wise, it depends on the character. I play 2 pet class characters:

One is a necromancer, and arrogant noble. Her pets are most definately
slaves, tools for doing her dirty work and sacrifices to save her hide
when things go bad.

The other is a Beastlord. His pet is his companion, partner, and
friend. He keeps it alive in battles and/or fights alongside it...
