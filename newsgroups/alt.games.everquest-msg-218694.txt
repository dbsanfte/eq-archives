I like Americans, generally. I work with a lot of them and have dated
a few of them, most of whom are Good People. But... you know a lot of wealthy
prosperous Europeans hate you? Its not envy. They think you're arrogant
bigoted assholes. Bin Laden has a personal fortune of millions
if you believe the media reports.

Really, I think its just an inexperience of the world; a solid belief
that your values are universal and anyone disagreeing must either be
oppressed, deluded, envious or stupid. But its not. Some people really
value other things - religious virtue, national glory, duty, honour,
or such - more than individual pleasure, liberty and freedom. They
place more value on it. And they hate you for trying to impose your
values on them 'because its good for them'.

Shrug. Just dont believe its cause they 'envy' you. Its actually because
they genuinely despise 'you'. Or the public Americana hyped by fox,
anyway.

Like I said, I dont agree, but it doesnt help to completely mischaracterise
the situation. Much better to understand your enemy - and some genuinely
are your enemies, dont doubt it.
