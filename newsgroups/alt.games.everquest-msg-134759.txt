I have a job.  Still have my girlfriend, no children, have completed my
epic.. sorry is there a point to these questions?

The point of Graefaxes response was morons like you ask the SAME fucking
question EVERY fucking patch day.

Why don't you try looking on the official everquest website, or read a few
posts on this NG, before clustering it with the SAME question, asked over
and over and over, time after time?   It doesn't even take 2 minutes to load
the website, and you will get an answer faster than anybody here will reply
to you
