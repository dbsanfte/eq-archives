You are correct about the dangling preposition.  I will correct it. Also, I
described Norrath because I have several friends who know nothing about it,
so I tried to describe it as best I could so they could understand the
story.

I used the wrong word when I used 'revere' I will also change that.

Thank you for your feedback. Please, I encourage you to read the rest of the
story.
