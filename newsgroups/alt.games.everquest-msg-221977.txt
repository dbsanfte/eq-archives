These bad boys drop plate look legs that a ranger can wear, a commodity
that seems to have gone the way of the dodo since PoP (though those yummy
legs from Maestro are an exception...if I had a chance in hell of ever
seeing them :P ).  So...a couple of questions.

1.  I've heard that the drop rate of items on Dark Masters is pretty
slim.  Truth?

2.  What is their respawn time?

3.  I know that killing these blokes while they are chanting will spawn
Doomshade.  As such, will killing them for their own sake when they are
not chanting earn me the deathly ire of every guild currently engaging
Doomshade?  Will I be "resetting" him somehow? 

Thanks in advance for any info you share. ^_^
