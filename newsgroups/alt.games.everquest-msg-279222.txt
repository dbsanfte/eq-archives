I never send a direct tell to someone who has not indicated in some 
fashion that they are willing to perform whatever service I am 
requesting.  I go anon in certain zones in order to reduce the liklihood 
that buff beggars will send me a tell.

I watch ooc/auction/shout to see who is offering the service I am looking 
for, or I use ooc to advertise that I am looking for said service.  If I 
don't find it available, I do without.

It just never bothered me in the slightest that someone was anon when 
sending me a tell begging for a buff, it bothered me that they sent me 
the tell period, their anon/roleplay status never figured into it.  In 
fact, I almost never even know what their anon/roleplay status is, I 
generally don't bother to answer or buff or check on them.  Which is why 
I don't understand the attitude you are describing I suppose.
