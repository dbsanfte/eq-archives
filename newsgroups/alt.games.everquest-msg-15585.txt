Can you put a backpack inside another backpack?

And what's a "Dimensional Pocket"? I was running back from the bank in FP
when someone who I didn't know stopped me and gave me a Dimensional Pocket.
Being as this was my first container of any kind I put some stuff in it to
hold. It only held 4 items and was a small container. I *think* it said NO
RENT, but I can't remember for sure. What does NO RENT mean?
Well I camped to try and find info about this on the web and after
unsucccessfully finding anything I came back and it was gone.
I guess NO RENT means that it is not persistent between camps?
Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
