It wouldn't matter if America was a communist or monarchy state. Nor
would it matter if no American ever set foot in the Middle East.
America is hated for being rich, and NOT populated by fundamentalist
muslims.

The fundamental truth is that the "Islamic Extremists" have bred
generations to hate all outsiders to the point of murder/war. Once you
wind up an "army" like that you have to turn them lose on somebody or
they feed on themselves. It's the same reason the Romans sent the
legions out to conqure new lands. It is also the main motivating force
behind the first Crusade.
