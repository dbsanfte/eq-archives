True, the Tunare symbols have a lengthy (but not outrangeous) cast
time.

The buffs last 5 minutes so if you are going to be fighting solo a
shaman or any other poision or disease casting NPC, I think the 15
seconds to swap neck items and cast the buff is worth 5 minutes of +15
resists to each. In a group, probably not worth it unless you are
fighting someing with AOE poision like the Poison Dragon.

The other cool effect is you can chain cast it while running and it
makes you look like you are leaving a trail of colorful sparks :-)
This looks particularly impressive in wolf form.

The root is the Druid's level 5 root spell. Most Druid's probably
remember this spell form level 5 where you would hope it would last
for 30 seconds--many times less. However at level 46, I would more
often than not get the full duration of the spell IIRC 2 minutes.

Solo or group the right-click root frees up a valuable spell gem slot
since most of the time you want to have root memorized.

Solo this spell saves mana leaving more for DOTS and nukes. Also comes
in very handy when you are OOM, allowing you to keep a MOB rooted
while you med. Now this won't allow you to solo a high red Ice Gaint,
but it does mean a few extra kills. Without this item, if I pulled 3
spectres, I could barely finish off the third; with it I can take out
all 3 and have mana left to spare.

Also very useful in a group. Rooting things is great for crowd
control. If MOB starts beating on the enchanter or cleric, I root it.
If it comes after me, I root it. As long as I have some space to move
around, I can keep MOBs rooted until the tanks have time take them
out.

Even you don't use the root, the stats are about as good as you are
going to get for sub-level 50 Druid neck item.
