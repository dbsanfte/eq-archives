Actually, that was my personal statement, However, there is a large
caveat,  The whole bit about telling random people on the street that
they are evil sinners and all going to hell tends to be counter
productive,  It is signifigantly more productive, and efficient to be a
friend, and friendly before pressing/presenting the heavy artillery,
that doesn't mean, I'm one of those "closet Christians", It simply means
that I'm not going to shove it down your throat as that tends to turn
people off to the whole message.

Thats great, but I am convinced that I have found the only way.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
