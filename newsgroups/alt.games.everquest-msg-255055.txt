I have no input on either of your points, as I already had my VP key so I
just killed the dragon and went in.

I do have one complaint.  There are, quite simply, too many wanderers to
make it even a semi-decent exp zone.  The way it's set up, you pretty much
have to kill in from zonein to get to a camp other than just camping the
zonein.  You can invis past a lot, but not everything, which makes that
semi-pointless, and you start fighting the moment someone loses invis cause
there are few, if any, safe spots.  And there's no breaks once you're inside
unless you plan ahead for them and restrict your killing to your camp/afk
spot.

Add on to that, the wanderers are the hardest mobs there.  That's just wrong
(though no different from PoE dillos/gators).

Loot...  eh.  Only did a couple hours there, and got something comparable to
a PoE trap or PoF mini drop, so it's not terrible.  But most of the PoE trap
or PoF mini drops rot for the people actually fighting there.

And the dragon to get in...  he's not "hard" as such, but he'll be beyond
your average family guild that's pre-elemental unless they just bring in the
zerg force.
