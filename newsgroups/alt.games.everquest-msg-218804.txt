I need your help guys!

My wee guild is just getting on it's wobbly legs, and my old friend who
has just started playing again is considering putting his 61 ranger aside
for now to start a plate class.  We plan on trioing a lot, and I suggested
that since he loves to tank, and I love to melee from a mobs rear-end, he
should be a plate-class.  

He brought up the point, however, that since our guild is so teenie right
now, he could very well end up as the guild's main tank.  I think he'd
enjoy it.  But while a paladin or SK would be the strong preference for
our trio, guild groups, and any 2-group raids, how far can a hybrid plate
tank go as a guild's main tank, assuming they are well-equipped and the
player is smart?  Where would our glass ceiling be?  Are we dooming our
friend to eventually having to step out of his favorite role so that a
warrior can take over?
