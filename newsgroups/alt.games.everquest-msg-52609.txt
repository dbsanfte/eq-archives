Bref extract from one of your replies where your trying to justify your Camp
Stealing.

"I agree, and also have it in a log file that he didn't start casting a
spell
until Hadden was about 3/4 dead (com'on...a big backstab and
a quad attack, followed by me getting pummeled and attacking back
twice doesn't exactly happen instantaneously).  Which the GM
apparantly noticed, too."

How can someone KS you when the player or Group that does 51% or the Most
damage gets credit for the Kill?
