You got a lower total because your technique was poor; "only killed 
giants if I could help it" is the opposite of what you need to do, the 
key is to kill the lizards, skellies, and cyclops and basilisks.  This 
is because the spawn table can randomly be any of the above, so if you 
kill only one of the above, you rapidly run out of that kind of mob. 
Killing a lizard takes a lot less effort than a HG, and has the same 
chance of spawning another HG.

I also deliberately dumped out everything not relevant to the task at 
hand into my bank, so I had maximum room, and I was using summoned bags 
so there was 100% WR in them.  Even then I'd have been better off 
looting only the FS weapons if I was going to stay long, because the run 
to a vendor shaves a lot of killing time, and nothing else vendored for 
over one pp.  Someone suggested going even further, not looting anything 
at all.. I'm not clear on the reasoning, since that 5pp FS weapon comes 
close to doubling the cash I get on about half the giants... and since I 
don't have to worry about the weight of the weapons, while the Cash does 
drag on me!

Splendid
