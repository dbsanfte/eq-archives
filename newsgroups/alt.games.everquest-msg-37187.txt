No, they haven't.  This is not something new, it's carried over from the
nonTCC zones.  Most mobs excluding undead, will never aggro if it won't give
you exp, unless they are over a certain level.  I believe 20 is the cutoff.
So basically, anything over 20 will aggro me no matter how green it is, if I
get within range.  So let's say that Stonebrunt is akin to LoIO.  Away from
the newbie area of Ill Omen a lot of mobs are over 20.  So if Stonebrunt is
similar, then high level characters who wish to explore the zone will be
forced to kill green trash which will aggro them, but will give no exp and
drop them no loot.  Seems fair.
