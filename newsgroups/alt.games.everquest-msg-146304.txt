DOH! found it, info is posted here:

http://www.eqloft.com/fullpost.php?languesite=uk&id=1579

and reads as follows:

If you want to know what to expect in the future patches, check out the last
one on the Test Server (the new SoW effect is rather nice)...

Test Server Patch message :

** Friday, August 30 2002.

Another week, and quite a few more changes. Some of these have gone in
unannounced earlier in the week, but here they all are, nice and organized
for you.

** New Particles:

- Welcome to the first testing of EQ's new, more efficient particle engine.
We've put some new effects on a few existing spells for people to look at.
- We've implemented a "Near Clip Plane" for the new particle engine. If
you're drowning in particles too close to your face, you can make this
number larger to cause EQ to "clip out" particles very close to you. This is
stored as NewParticleClipPlane in your eqclient.ini. For now, you can change
it there.
- The particle density for the new particles is controlled by the option
"NewParticleDensity" in your eqclient.ini. The range to work with is 0.0 to
1.0.
- Unlike the first version of this patch message stated, commands such as
/showspelleffects won't effect the new particle system.
