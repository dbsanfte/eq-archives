Halflings roasting on an open fire
Frogluks hanging by their toes
Warlike chants rising up from the mire
And Trolls dressing out the vanquished foes

Every Ogre knows Gnomes garnished with some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny cubs with their fangs all aglow
Will find it fun to feast tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of Elves and goodies on his sleigh
And every Ogre's child is gonna spy
To see if Papa's really got the spawn timed right

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
For those in groups six, five, four, three, and two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Wait 'til I call assist or I'll eat you!
