Mirriam Webster gives a date of 1795 for the word.

A brief search with google yielded this:

Terrorism did not originate in the Middle East. Rather, the word, along with
terrorist, first appears in English in 1795 in reference to the Jacobins of
France. They ruled France in what was called the Reign of Terror from
1793-94. By 1798, the term was being applied generally to anyone who
attempted to achieve political goals through violence and intimidation.
The word is thought to have been coined by the Jacobins themselves, but the
French terrorisme is not recorded until 1798. If the Jacobins did coin it,
they are the only ones to have used it self-referentially. The term has
always had negative connotations since then.
