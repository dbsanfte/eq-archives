1 Opinion. So far, all I've found are a bunch of Blogs with conspiracy
theory. But I'm still looking. 

As far as the 98% brandishment thing, in his book at least, he stated
"If National survey;s are correct, 98%..." So As far as I'm concerned
on that, he covered himself, at least from a weasel point of view. 

Let's keep on looking tho... I'll be giving you the benefit of the
doubt. And no, I don't believe you, or Donald Kennedy. I'll do my
checking for myself, thank you very much.
