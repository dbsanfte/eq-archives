Thats a good example of the sort of thing I'm thinking of.  Here's 
another.  Commodore.  Best computer I've ever owned (from the TI-58 up 
to my Pentium 4) was my C-64.  But the upgrade to the C-128 had a button 
you held down to make the machine work like a C-64, so you weren't 
running your C64 software on a C128, it wasn't compatible, and there was 
very little C128 software produced.  Then they went to a... what, colt? 
  Amiga? I forget.  Totally non compatible.

I looked around long and hard, and moved to IBM/DOS, because they had a 
committment to backwards compatability.  I've stayed with the IBM 
compatible, sadly moved into windows, but ever since the move I've never 
once been forced to stop using something I had been using, never lost 
all my data by  moving up.   Eventually some of my old games became 
unusable because I didn't care to keep putting 5 1/4 floppy drives into 
my machines... but in theory I still could.

This sounds like something that they could still change.  And should. 
Call EQ2 a working title, and say the real name is EverQuest Lite.  Or 
EverQuest Entrance.  Or... heck, those aren't very good, but I bet if we 
put our heads together we could come up with something, and we aren't 
even in marketing.

IF they sell it as that.  If they sell it as the upgrade to EQ, then 
they are getting the wrong people to come to the game (existing and 
former EQ players) and driving the people they -want- (new players and 
players from other MMOGs) away.  And if they spend a lot of time touting 
their new engine and up to date tech and graphics, they invite the 
impression that original EQ must not be as good.

Well, I think EQ has an advantage in that its had years to develop, and 
its adherants have funded hundreds of dollars in content, in the form of 
buying the series of expansions over the years.  You can't sell a game 
that costs $220 in box, so how do you pay for an equivalent amount of 
content production?

I don't agree.  I think its an effect of the way the game designers have 
treated the world.  In order to sell new content, they make it "better" 
than the old content.  Which is fine at first, whats wrong with people 
running off to explore new areas, and leaving the old overcrowded zones 
to those who haven't yet bought in?  But after a while, you no longer 
need to force that expansion down people's throats.  A three month 
period where you're rewarding the people who buy in would be sufficient. 
  Then (IMO) you want to start spreading people around again.  Make the 
old world stuff fit into the continuum along with the new.

I'm not only referring to the butcherblock levels, though, there are 
zones in the world from level 5 to 60 that are deserted.  Many of them 
fun entertaining zones.  But the quests that used to be popular in those 
areas, the gear that used to drop there that people wanted, the exp 
rates in those zones, those have all be superceded by new content that 
puts them to shame.

Some of the quests that used to be fantastic, the Sol Ro class quests, 
for example... you can buy better than that stuff in the bazaar for less 
than the material components (platinum bars etc) that you have to buy 
from the stores in order to run those quests.   IMO they should have had 
quests in each of the expansions to upgrade those core quest items to 
the new standard...not the best that expansion has to offer, but good 
enough that you don't just slam it all into the nearest dumpster.

Epic items are another higher level example.  Those things involve 
quests that took people years in some cases to complete, yet in many 
cases you can now get better for a few Kpp in the bazaar, in MOST cases 
you can get better for less effort before you hit level 65.  Rumor had 
it POP would have the "next step" epic items, where you had to have your 
epic in order to get epic 2.  Didn't happen.  Might never have been in 
the pipe.  But when you look at how strong that rumor was, you have to 
wonder why no developer has ever thought "hmmm, thats a good idea".

Closest I've seen to any of this is that the old Planar armor (drops in 
old Hate and Fear) could be turned in to guildmasters in POP for random 
gems plus exp.  Thats a mighty small carrot, but at least it was 
Something for the effort of collecting that gear.  No drop stuff thats 
totally useless is somehow just... disheartening.

Hopefully, the people in the guild would be people who do see the point.

You could also require that people group ONLY with others in the guild.

Thing is, though, people progress at different speeds, due to skill, 
talent, choice of class, time comittment, luck... unless your guild 
consists of 6 people who only play that character when the other 5 are 
all there, and none of whom take a race or class with an exp penalty or 
bonus (hmm, maybe I'd allow barbarian rogues, does that cancel out?), 
and thus can all play grouped with each other at all times... well, your 
guild ends up spreading out across the level lines.

They are there... but for the most part, there's little reason to go to 
them.  Exceptions, like Rathe Mountains, only serve to prove the rule; 
people will go to zones that have things worth doing;  RM Giants are 
good money for the effort and power needed to get it, so people still go 
there.  Also helps that its now only one zone away from a POP book of 
course...

If I offered you two jobs, roughly the same in difficulty, but one paid 
$10 an hour and another paid $6 an hour, which would you take?  This is 
whats happening to the old world zones, they generally "pay less" 
(whether that pay comes in worthwhile items, worthwhile quests, cash, 
gems, exp... or once upon a time, even faction could be a drive)  for 
similar effort, so they've been abandoned.

Another example to prove the rule.  Very few quests anything like that 
seem to exist.  The plan seems to be for new content to replace old 
content... but this means that instead of a world consisting of 7 
expansions worth of content, you really have perhaps 3 expansions worth 
of zones that are actually in use.  What a waste!
