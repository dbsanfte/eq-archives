Okay, I can't seem to let this go.

After my latest trip to the Warrens, I was converting
loot to cash. I had these two items:

Bronze Tanto, Dam:3, Delay:22, Range:40, Wgt:3, Piercing
Bronze Jutte, Dam:3, Delay:23, Wgt:4, Piercing

These stats are nearly identical, except that the
Tanto appears to be superior in that it weighs less,
is slightly faster and can be thrown.

Regardless, the offer for the Tanto was 2 gold and change
while the offer for the Jutte was nearly 2 plat.

Why is the Jutte so much more valuable? Is it really a
better weapon? If so, why?

What makes one weapon more valuable than another, nearly
identical weapon?
