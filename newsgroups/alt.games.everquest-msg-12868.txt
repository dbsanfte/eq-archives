If I'm in a group and the others aren't playing like morons, I'll usually
just ignore it.  However, if I'm travelling or working on tradeskills, I
expect anyone that requests something of me to take the time to type it
properly.  Someone who just walks up to me unasked and says "nd Sow plz"
probably won't even get a response, let alone a buff.  After all, it's my
spell and my mana, so I get to set the criteria when dealing with ranodm
non-grouped strangers.  :)
