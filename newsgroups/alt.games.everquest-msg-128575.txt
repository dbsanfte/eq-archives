As a general rule of thumb, clerics get better heals than shaman or druids,
or rather they get the -same- heals but get them at lower levels where
they are more useful.  A better heal is one that is either for more points
(putting out more heal per cast means you can overcome faster hitting mobs)
or for a better mana to HP ratio (meaning you can sustain healing longer.
Clerics also tend to specialize in alteration, which means after 30 they
rapidly are getting a better ratio even with an identical spell, since they
spend less to cast it.

A shaman competes with a cleric as a healer only if you take into
account his slow line.  Reducing the incoming damage rate down to
where his lesser heal capability is still up to the challenge works fairly
well... except early in the fight when he hasn't landed slow yet, or
when he is outclassed by the mob; you can throw a lower level cleric
in your group and not see much change in healing out put, but throw
in a low level shaman and you'll definately notice the difference.
As for a druid, they make up for their relatively crappy heals by...
not calling themselves healers.  Druids are basically wizards who
have some healing capability and other utility spells, a fine class but
if you are relying on one as your main healer then you probably could
have killed the mob without a healer at all.

While CHeal is the "killer app" its really not all that big a deal with
tanks in the 30s and 40s, its painfully slow and a huge mana hog, unless
the tank has a vast reservior of HP and is fairly badly damaged its
probably more effective to cast other heals.

Hmm, this makes me keen to go play with them.... you know who is great for
soaking HTs?  Other mobs.  Charm something with enough HP to stand up to
a few HT before vanishing, let it go in and die gloriously, and I'm facing
several
pissed off mobs that are hard hitting but low on HP... perfect charm kite
fodder.
