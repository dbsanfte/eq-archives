I think this is a great example of what I'm talking about.  If
you are at 10-20 mana and the rest are at 80-FM, then you need to
start doing less.  Keep them from going FM, you are wasting mana
regen.  Skip slow on the easy mobs, or stop stunning, or tell the
puller you want him to bring fewer mobs, heck, go pull yourself
with Pacify if he needs the help.

Now if they are running 60M-80M while you are running 10M-20M,
then your paces are matched, which is great, but you could still
slow down for a few pulls and get your average mana level up to
50M or better while they spend a little more than usual, and then
resume so you all have 50M-60M during all pulls, no mana wasted
and everyone much more ready for a disaster.  Heck, then you
could all med for a little bit and get everyone up to the 70-80M
level... resume pulls with an even bigger safety net, and you've
only lost whatever time you spent medding; its not going to
accumulate because you fixed your problem, everyone is going at
about the same pace now.
