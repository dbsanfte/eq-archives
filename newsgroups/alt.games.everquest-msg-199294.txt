Ok, I agree then. If my druid was a wood elf and had wisdom items I'd 
have stopped porcupining at 20 as well.  As a half elf battle druid I 
used the tactic into my 40s.  Of course this was years ago on old world 
mobs, I don't think I'd want to try that tactic on SoL/PoP mobs <g>. 
Clearly in terms of efficiency druid melee is not the route to follow, 
but if you are looking for fun without concerns about exp per hour, 
number of times you have to run away and number of horrible deaths, 
battle druid is something to hold on to as long as you can.
