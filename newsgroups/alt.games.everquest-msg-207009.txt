Only for feign death.    If you simply run out of range, the mob may stop
chasing, but it continues to remember you.  It is possible to stay far
enough away after that it isn't an issue, but the mob you aggroed will
remain extra sensitive to you.   They will come after you to "continue the
battle" as soon as they come within range.  (A range that is *much* larger
than thier normal aggro range.)
