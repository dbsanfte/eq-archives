Well, most of my DT deaths aren't listed there.  Luckily in my guild
we have to fight to see who takes the DT.  Bards can run the fastest
though, so we have been known to take one or two when it's not even
our turn.  It tends to upset the Paladins though, complaining that
we're taking their special raid skill from them.
A whole lot of them were from whatever big mob we were fighting saying
"Arolpin, you will not evade me!  Bards make good crunchy snax!"  I
was amazed at how often I was getting summoned.  I guess being 5
levels below the rest of the guild did have some disadvantages.

bard of many deaths
