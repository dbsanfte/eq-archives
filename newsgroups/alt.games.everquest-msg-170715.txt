Combo yesterday in Maru Seru:

2 BeastLords
1 Warrior
1 Cleric
1 Druid
1 Shaman

No real crowd control except for Root and Pet tanking.  Warrior would
often pull 4+ mobs but we just mowed them down.  Mobs died so fast
that I barely had time to get off a Slow on them.  Those beastlords
are quite powerful.   Only time it got hairy was when the warrior
pulled 7 or 8 mobs plus we got 2 lightcrawler adds and 2 Ancient
Zelnaks - 10+ mobs with no enchanter.  We actually had to take a break
for a few after that as mana ran low.

This was also my first experience with KEI.  I was 28th and 4 yellow
from 29th.
Decided to fork over the cash to see if KEI would speed leveling to
29th and my new spells.  MEIN GOTT!!!  Regen to everyone, buff
everyone, still lots of mana.
No need to cannibalize at all. I'm used to being close to 0 mana after
buffing everybody and sitting alot. Plenty of mana - spent much of the
time nuking (DOTs weren't needed as mobs died within a few seconds),
felt like a Wizard.  29th came rapidly.

I am definately going for a KEI on my 24th Wizard.  He's been stuck at
24th for forever as the wizard downtime is too boring for me and I
discovered other classes. Plus it is a long haul from 24th to 29th
where he will get a snare.  Root blasting = lots of downtime.  But
with KEI the Wiz should rock on.
