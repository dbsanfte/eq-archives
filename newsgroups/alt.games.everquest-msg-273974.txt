Why *would* he call someone, who started crap and then backed off after
running a big mouth, a vagina? It makes zero sense. On the other hand, it
does make a lot sense to call that person a coward or a wimp.

I find your use of "lame" in reference to others that you believe to have
inferior opinions to be offensive, because you're making fun of handicapped
people and thus imply that they are inferior individuals, which is fairly
low of you. Shame on you.
