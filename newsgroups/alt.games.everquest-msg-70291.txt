	Root will change the mob to proximity agro -- for as long as it's rooted,
it will hit whoever is closest to it.  (This is why Rangers HATE earth pets --
they root constantly, causing mobs to turn on people unexpectedly and to
become unJoltable.)

	Of course, against high-level mobs with decent resists, it doesn't last
that long.

	It's the HP disparity.  Alone of the fighter classes, Rangers get no
significant hit point increases past level 50.
