    This can be a big problem when the GM is also willing to bend rules. My
buddy had one instance where (back when this was a big thing) they found
Tolapmuj up. They were ahead of a "big guild" raid, and were about to get
him, when everyone from his guild (and only his guild) went LD. When they
came back, the big guild was there looting Tolapumj and a GM was standing
right there. Must be "connection problems at their end", right? =/

    Ah, so YOU were the server with the grief guild! For people who hadn't
heard: when the recipe for mature cheese was put in game, it sold back to a
merchant for much more than the cost of buying the components. People were
making 750 pp per hour making cheese and selling it back to the vendor. On
one server, the local big guild started killing the vendor whenever he
popped - apparently that was Jazz's server. The funny thing is that after
the GMs arived, guess what they did? You got it - they permakilled the
vendor pending the next patch, which corrected the pricing issue. Who knows,
maybe the GM told them to do it in guild chat! ;-)

    I imagine no action was taken because the players, even if they were
jackasses, were only doing what the GM ended up doing anyways -
perma-killing the vendor so nobody could exploit a pricing error. If they're
as close as you indicated with CS staff on the server, they may have
actually asked if they should do it first. I am surprised that a guild would
do something like that to other players, though.
