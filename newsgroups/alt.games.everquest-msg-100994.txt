Well then, I suppose they should figure out a way for my old 75 Mhz Pentium
1 PC with 8 megs of RAM to play it too, seeing as how that cost my family
$2500.

Newsflash: money years ago doesn't equate to performance today.  That's the
nature of the PC industry.  Programs get more powerful, so do the computers
needed to run them.
