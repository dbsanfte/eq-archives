A very good concept, but we dont' do the merit thing. If there are five
warriors on the raid and a good BP drops, they all have the *right* to
roll on it by our loot rules. That said, if I suggest that I am going to
pass on the first BP for the "good of the guild" so the MA can get
beefed up, there's a fair chance the rest of the lower level warriors
will follow suit. Well, that's my plan anyway.
