Got one char at 200 in fishing and the other two are on their way.
For my one at 200, I was pretty much all over the board with her.
I went to eqtraders, looked at their list of 'Fishing Holes' and
looked up each 'special' fish and saw what could be made out of
them and then would go to wherever seemed like a good deal or had
fish that I could use in tradeskills.  There are lots of different
fish that are usable and, if you're a foraging class, there are
lots of places that will be a 'double whammy' for you (i.e., you
can sit, fish and forage and get usable, sellable items out of
both.)

Too many places I've fished to list them all. Besides, eqtraders
has already done it for me. :)
