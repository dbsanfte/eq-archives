Yeah ns, we had about 80 people for one tormy killing, and other then no
real sense of achievement, the lag was atrocious.  Im probably being unfair
about no real achievment...3 cheal rotation clerics all went LD at the
start, which isn't the best start.

I don't mean the MA losing agro - when he rampages though, he hits the top
series of people on his hate list (which for some reason always includes the
puller).  We only really have clerics in the cheal groups, so the puller
gets squished.

Last time I pulled him, he rampage killed me when I was on the floor FD
heh.. grrrr
I suggested last night we try AoW.. statue is up soon, so wish us luck :)
