Actually, this isn't quite the right comparison.  So though this
doesn't really pertain directly to your BER/ENC duo questions, let
me try to separate the apples from the oranges. :-)

If you fought two identical mobs one at a time, without the chain
stun, you'd take some amount of damage on average from each mob.
Call that damage X.  Total damage taken from two mobs is 2X.  For
simplicity, assume the mobs never run, so they're hitting on you
the whole time.

If you fight them at the same time, you take damage 2X while killing
the first one.  Then you take another X while killing the second.
Total is 3X, or 1.5 times as much.

If the mobs would normally do a death march at 20% hits, then it's
even worse, because the first mob usually keeps fighting due to
its buddy being there, so you take more than X damage from each mob
while you kill the first.

Fighting three mobs, you'd take 6X damage, or twice what they'd do
individually.  Fighting four you'd take 10X damage -- well, except
you'd probably die before that. :-)

Anyway, throw in your chain stuns so you normally take X/2 from a
single mob.  Now you take 3X/2 from the pair, plus another X/2 from
the second one alone, for a total of 2X, whereas fighting them one
at a time you'd take a total of just X.  So yes, you take three
times the DPS while you fight the first mob, but the total damage
you take for the pair is "only" doubled compared to two singles.
Fighting three with stuns you'd take 5X/2 + 3X/2 + X/2 = 4.5 X,
which is triple what you'd take from three singles.

None of this should come as any real surprise, since it's really
just the flip side of what players regularly do to mobs.  We all
understand how having two, or three, or six! players beating on the
same mob is far more than two/three/six times as efficient.  Much
of the efficiency comes from the mob dying so much faster that its
damage output is reduced.  If two similar PCs each fight separate
similar mobs one-on-one, and each player takes damage X doing so,
then the two of them ganging up on a mob will kill it after it does
only X/2 damage, after which they can pull the second mob and kill
it as it does X/2 damage.  The mobs together did X damage instead
of 2X.  (Of course, some of the efficiency also comes from the fact
that the mobs' damage can be concentrated against the tank, who can
take it a lot better than the caster. :-)
