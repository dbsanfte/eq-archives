So true.

I sincerely hope that Sony continues to revamp the older zones. The
"newbie" gardens that have been revamped are fantastic for characters
1-12. The class armor quests are fun and challenging. Some are broken
or too hard, but most are really good.

Now if they would direct their attention at the underused or ignored
low-mid level zones. (12-30), and then the mid level zones (40-50),
the game would really shine.
