    The one person I know that bought an account to play is a gentleman who
has MS and realized he didn't have the time to level his own character up to
"catch up" with his friends, so he purchased one of my guild's retiring
characters that was the same class. Everquest is one of the few things he
can still do for entertainment. He's quite capable of distinguishing a game
from reality, thank you very much.

    I'm not suggesting that Playerauctions is a good thing. I know of
several people who buy and sell characters professionally, or who sell a
character, get it back through Verant, strip it of whatever the purchaser
put on it, then move on to the next person. The big con artist on my server
that does this is 15, and yes, his mother allowed him to use her credit card
to get started.
