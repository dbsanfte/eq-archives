The Shadeweaver quests (with the exception of the BP) are all very
easy to complete.  You get the stuff in the course of normal leveling.
Are PSU's very spendy on test?  I'd think that any server with a 
population of 40's in DSP would see these fall fast.  Also, the
Orc fang stuff can't be terribly spendy - again, a population of
40's in EW will flood the market with them.  Now, the BP is a
good call - although if you took the time you could have one by
25 on test - again  it's quested, you just have to get lucky on 
the bug pops.  Now, the goranga idol and the spider fur belt are 
different matters - lots of farming needed to drop those so fast.
