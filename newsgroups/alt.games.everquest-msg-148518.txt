I think he wants to become a trader, ya know, buy low sell and make good
money! Well, my friend, on our server (the nameless) I like to buy cloaks of
the maelstrom cheap and sell for a couple k higher. Or perhaps helms of
raldukan. Got one of those for 8k and sold for 12k. Hope this helps, just
look around in the bazaar.
