Ok, the rangers role will change at least 2 times over the life of the
character, between 25 and 35, plate classes and monks will take over as
tank(meat shield) between 43 and 48  you will no longer be able to tank
acceptably even in the absense of a plate class/monk.  you will be a
caster with weak spells and high damage output.  and monks and rogues
will outdamage you.  above 50, if you get hit, you will likely die.

Personally I like being a ranger, but there are down-sides.
