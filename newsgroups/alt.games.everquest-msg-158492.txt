Why the Brell not?  DA is a very powerful tool.  A couple years ago, it was
merely a cowards spell, used to escape a bad situation at the cost of running
out on your party.  I note you keep Gate memmed, so you already have the coward
angle covered, not that thats a bad thing.

But they changed what DA does, by adding a component to it which drastically
lowers your position on the Hate list.  This means when you are forced to slap a
heal on someone too early or too soon after the previous one, and get mobs on
you you shouldn't have, you can ditch that aggro right back to the tanks where
its supposed to be.  Further, you can sit down in the middle of an outrageously
bad battle situation and mem whatever spell you need for the situation without
getting interupted.  Mem DA instead of Gate, and if you ever really need gate,
Brell, just sit down and mem it.

I spent most of two years as cleric without using DA more than as a way to get
down from Kelethin... and now its always memmed, and DB is very often memmed as
well.  Aggro control is one of the keystones of any fight, and DA/DB is a
powerful tool at your disposal for this purpose.
