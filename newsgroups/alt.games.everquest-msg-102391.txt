levels 1-15 are hell for an enchanter, but the levels afterward make up for
it many times over. I was able to get into OT groups at 26, and DL at 35,
and no sitting around waiting for groups. When everything you kill is red,
the xp goes kinda fast, and clarity pretty much guarentees a quick pull
group.
