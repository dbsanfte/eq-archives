You "wasted an entire EQ day" "proving" your point? And where are the
fruits of this labor? Where is the "proof" you wasted so much time
gathering? You have given nothing, nada, jack shit to back it up still
except only to say "It's true, so neener!".

Simple fact remains, you are full of shit. That is not an opinion. You
can make as many claims as you like, but if you refuse to back them
up, then you are full of shit. So far, you are the *ONLY* person who
has made or supported the claim that taunt will raise without priming.
NOBODY has backed you up on this. The only voices aside from your own
are saying the same thing: "Bullshit!".
