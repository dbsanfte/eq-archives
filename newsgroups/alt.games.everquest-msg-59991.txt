Are there any alternatives to getting freeport faction? Is getting the
faction for the dark elf city (aargh. I can't remember what it's
called. I've only been playing 18 months, I can't believe I forgot
this) easier that freeport?

Or is there any other way to buy food, drink etc? Banking is useful,
but not all that important. Can iksar bank in the overthere without
gaining faction, or are they KOS there too?
