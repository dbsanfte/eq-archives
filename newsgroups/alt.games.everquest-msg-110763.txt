Agnostic you are not KoS in highpass or SH/Bazaar

If you are an Inny worshiper you are kos in highpass, agnostic are not. Also
there are some guards near the spire (bridge to the south) which will be kos
to you if you are an Inny worshiper.

The dwarves are very kos to dark elves, but you can get around them if you
are careful (jump off boat, swim around the right side of dock area wall,
watch for the other guards). If you have invis they don't see through it.

The High/Wood elves are kos to you like noone's business, but you don't have
to get near them to get to the gfay spire.

Easiest trick if Inny worshiper: Go to WC with about 10-20 plat, wait for
someone offering a port to NK, Toxx, or DL (don't beg, just wait, someone
will show up in the next half hour). Amazingly enough Dreadlands is your
safest port up point, nothing agro near the spires or between the spires and
the druid circle.

Toxx is pretty safe as well, though if Inny you will need invis/camo during
the port if going to the druid circle. Ditto with NK.
