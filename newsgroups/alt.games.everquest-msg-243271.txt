Granted, there are a few exceptions to every rule... but most of the stuff
that can *only* be found at such and such camp, isnt worth the hassle to
get. yes its rare and you can only get it in one area. but in the time it
takes to get that item another camper could have hit several targets and
acquired several items to sell for the same ammount or more.
