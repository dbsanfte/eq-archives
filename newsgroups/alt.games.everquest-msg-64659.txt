I have only two pieces of 128MB PC100 SDRAM in my motherboard.  Its a
"Gigabyte" brand, model "GA-7ZX, VIA KT133 series chipset".  My question is
if I bought 256MB more RAM but was only able to find PC133, can I run PC133
with my PC100?  I know PC100 and PC66 both in the same system will run as
PC66 (can't run faster than the slowest part).  But it seams I've read
somewhere that some PC133 can ONLY run at 133, not 100.  Is there any truth
to that?
    Also does brand matter?  NewEgg http://www.newegg.com has Kingston PC133
SDRAM and I'm not 100% sure what brand I'd put in there nearly 18 months
ago.  Would it matter to mix brands?  I'm looking at
http://www.newegg.com/app/viewproduct.asp?description=20-136-112&DEPA=1 for
the price and info.
    Also want to get the ATI All-in-Wonder Radeon 32MB DDR card.  Its here
at http://www.newegg.com/app/specification.asp?item=14-102-162  Someone on
EQ claimed to be currently using it and it works great.  Verant claims that
the All-in-Wonder 128 Pro works, and so does the Radeon, so I don't see a
reason that a combination of both shouldn't work.

Also I'm running Windows 98SE, currently with a VooDoo3 3500 AGP 16MB RAM
which isn't doing too good, plus my other PC has an older ATI All-in-wonder
and I like it for video capture/record so thats why I'm looking at this one
again.
