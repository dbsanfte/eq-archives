just FYI . . those scorpions are the absolute best experience short of being
grouped with the 3 wizards left alive on a dragon raid (and being there when
they get the finishing blow . . full yellow at 51, wute!)

at level 35 (this is back when hell levels were obvious, not greyed), one
dead scorp = 1 blue of exp

NEED cleric and NEED warrior . . . recommend druid as the third, but use
your imagination and be smart/buffed/twinked

they HT for 450-650, have DS's and hit for 60's (?), double, and are fast .
. BUT they have low hp (their HT can't recycle most times)

lev to fall in . . . don't play near astral projection . . . don't get lost
. . . keep cool and ya rake in the exp

(if they darkness you, don't run . . . and their HT's are ranged, so if you
have aggro and go anywhere near the pit . . ZAP !)
