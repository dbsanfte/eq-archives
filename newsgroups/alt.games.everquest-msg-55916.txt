I believe that's what he was referring to. Ubermob raids (and his guild
can certainly speak to that) apparently have that quality. Former
members of our guild who left for uberguilds posted to our boards about
a similar restriction on taking down Cazic. Don't know about the ToV
dragons or ST mobs and such, since none of my close friends have done it
yet. Demogorth could probably speak to this question well if he wants to
jump into the thread. I know he's done the third warder a couple times.
