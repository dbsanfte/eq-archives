Oops! Right you are. My mental block from embarrassment caused me to
recount it incorrectly.  I believe I had actually mapped the "m" key
to both move forward and Sense Heading on the first char.  The button
on the second char which corresponded to the first char's Sense
Heading button happened to be LFG.

Anyway, that's the basic idea, just keep it in mind.
