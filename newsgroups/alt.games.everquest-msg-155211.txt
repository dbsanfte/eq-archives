OK well the muffin quest has already been mentioned but there is another way
to get it started if you have a friend who has not ruined that faction. Get
him/her to do the quest up to the DE corrupter in EK and you loot the tomb

wrong. The biggest PITA I found was doing the bats wing guest which seems to
take forever :0(
