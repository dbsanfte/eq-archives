yeah there is one way.
Use a voodoo 3 card. Set your game properties "Screen Resolution Same" to
off. This alternates the resolution when you switch between the view modes
with the F10 key.

You can then alt tab and do what you like.

To return to the game just hit F10 3 or 4 times and the resolution swapping
will bring your game screen back up.

One minor glitch with this is that anything you type when alt tabbed will
also show up in the games chat box. So be careful what yer typing. Also
hitting the I key whilst tabbed will often open the inventory and drop you
back into the game.

Its not a great solution and its practically the only one besides EQwindows
which is still very under development. You can't get banned for using EQ
windows unless you run it from your everquest directory.

So its a throw up between using an old card with some quirks or EQwindows
which has quirks also.

You decide.
