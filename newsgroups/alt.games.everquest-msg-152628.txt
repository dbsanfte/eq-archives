Unfortunately this game requires massive time commitments to get 
anywhere in it.
Whether it be medding/healing for a long time.
Or waiting for boats that take forever to arrive then get to there 
destination. Or as in this case camping things for ages just to get 1 
item, worse still the mob you need to kill probably requires a group 
so are the people with you prepared to camp the spot for ages too? 
Probably not.
I think verant took the whole realism thing too serious and its ruined 
the game.
I hope they learn from a lot of there errors for eq 2 but i doubt they 
will there only after our cash after all.
EQ is still very addictive though, at low levels the game draws you in 
and gets you hooked.
At mid to high levels though the game is spoilt.
In another thread i started recently ive learn just how long the game 
takes to get a level after 50+ and very dissapointed.
I cannot believe everquest has 400,00 subscribers and we all put up with 
this bollocks
Although from previous experience with feedback and tech support they 
dont read any of the complaints anyway.
