You may very well think that, and I certainly
wouldn't fault you for drawing that conclusion,
but you don't know, and can never know, for
certain, exactly what her motives might be.

You can guess, but you don't know.

The court case (if not dismissed as frivolous),
will decide whether there is indeed, someone or
something, other than herself to blame for the
death, and in particular, whether EQ was at fault.

>>What if EQ caused the depression?

>What if it didn't? 

Then there is no problem for Sony, is there?

I don't know if you read the earlier part of the
thread, but the question was raised "What about
blaming depression for his death"

I think asking "What if EQ caused the depression?"
is a fair question. One that, I think the people
at Sony will be preparing to answer.

Not at all. 

I suspect this will be one of the most un-moot
points in the whole affair.

If EQ caused his depression, and you can be sure
that the lawyer will be trying to prove that
particular causal link, then the case will gain
some legs.
