Fair enough point, but the two don't have to be mutually exclusive. The best
levelling I ever did post-50 was in S Wing Howling Stones. In 57-58 it's
easily better than 1 blue per hour and omg the loot!

Ok sure, raid skills are learned on raids. I'll stick to my guns that people
who have levelled in dungeons will learn these faster and have a less steep
curve to climb.

Dear god yes.
I've been thinking about this and the conclusion I've come to is this:
The reason I am so against outdoor levelling is because PreKunark there was
a straight choice. You either played in dungeons, took the risk and levelled
fast with decent loot. OR you levelled outside but progressed more slowly
but with added safety.
Kunark changed all that with LOIO and OT where you have the safety of oasis
coupled with the exp of an efreeti camp. And that pisses me off, especially
when people brag to me about how fast they quad-kited their way through the
OT levels in 3 days as if that makes them 'the shit'.

I levelled all the way to 50 without a cleric. My group would make back lost
exp in half the time other people wasted looking for a cleric to res them.
Granted, 49 clerics were rarer in those days but my prejudices remain :)

Ok I will concede that point basically because it's a long time since I was
in a pickup group. Even when I was doing pickups though, I was one of those
players that would insist on need-before-greed before there was a phrase for
it, and (after some nasty experiences at very low levels) would never leave
a group until everyone had their corpses and was safe. I'm nowhere near this
honourable and altruistic in real life, but that's what fantasy games are
for, right? :)

That

Heh I have anecdotal evidence from a chap I work with that his raid leader
(also guild leader and main tank) has told him not to use CH. He (rightly)
disagrees. CH is the most broken and powerful spell in the game so it makes
no sense to disregard it.

In a deep dungeon crawl a dead cleric is just as bad news as a dead
enchanter. I'd rather see 'Barrier Up!' so I can stop worrying about at
least one person for a few seconds while I taunt off the enchanter (who with
stuns and Berserk can look after himself pretty well for a few seconds).

One can't help but love that spell. I remember the days of the 10-sec cast

Absolutely. If your tank needs a CH that early with 4 mobs though, he may
well need some more AC. Or to stop pulling hasted krups :)

Haha Aegolism isn't so bad unless you are the ONLY 60 cleric on the raid :)
I've always enjoyed trying to do what others do with whatever tools I have
at hand regardless of the gear I'm wearing. That's probably why I managed to
level to 50 without a cleric and did other 'crazy' things like explore HS in
the very early days without access to a necro (seminaked CR in HS anyone?
:)).
Ability, efficiency and understanding the game mechanics can make up for
pretty much any equipment deficiency.

My point here being that there are almost no skills that you will never be
called on to use, and to neglect them in the race to level fast is a
mistake. Some examples would be us using ID to open locked doors (/cough)
before VI 'fixed' that, and using poison to slow otherwise unslowable mobs.
I need to be able to rely on having every tool possible available for me to
deploy on raids.

Well TBH the simple logistics of equipping say a 40-person raid with 3 vulak
pieces each is futile. Sooner or later you reach a point where, yes, there
may be upgrades available but the chances of you even seeing them, let alone
being awarded them are so remote or so much effort that you may as well give
up even if you are in the uppermost guild of your server. And if you are
solely motivated by the need for uber gear, what are you gonna do when this
day comes?

EQ is a progression. You'll have a harder time surviving the raids unless
you've got some decent dungeon gear on. Which reminds me, I still need some
fungi tunics and another cobalt bracer would be nice. . .;)
