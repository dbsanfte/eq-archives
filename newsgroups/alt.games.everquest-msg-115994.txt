Not being a smartass, but "deal with it" is the only suggestion I've
found thus far.  For me it started the day after the "Saint Valentines
Day Eve Massacre" patch. My sound has never been the same since. Some
days I log in and get all sound working fine. Later that same day, no
battle music, but all other sounds are ok. The next day, no sound at all
followed by all sounds working fine that night.

/shrug

And this is with NO changes in drivers since the new set I installed
right after that patch. (I couldn't log in <at all> with the previous
drivers. These at least got me in, even if the music was fubar.)

There's a chance there was just a minor stealth "tweak" that VI did this
week, and maybe your system doesn't like it.
