    If you look at what monk boots are out there (and Dream King, our
resident leeezard can comfirm this), you'll see that these are pretty damn
slick. To put it in perspective, a lot of mid-to-higher level monks were
estatic when Wu's Fighting Slippers came out, and these things drop-kick
Wu's. I could almost get my 38 MNK's STR over 100 with these (Iksar, almost
all starting points went to STA).

    Snowbeast, level 40 if people's /ooc's about "It's blue to me" can be
believed.

>thing there is blue up to level 59.

    I think that's the named panda. I'd heard the original plan was for
there to be Titans, a mob of each of the animal types out there that was
just massive. So far the only titans I've heard of are the panda and the
Snowbeast (ape?).

>No, actually they don't care.

    You're mis-reading. I think it's a bit ironic after hailing the loot
code as stopping farming that a solitary mob, of a level such that nobody
normally hunting there will take him, which drops uber loot, is placed in
the loot coded zone. He is a PRIME target for the level 50's soloists.

    It DID bring a smile to my face. I posted the drop, which is about the
power level you'd expect given what the quest piece drops from, specifically
to give Dark Tyger a smile. ;-) Oh - the quest bumped up faction for
PeaceKeepers and KejekanVillage.

    I think that might be the same cat.
