Really.  This "quest" is the biggest pain in the hiney.  You make this LONG RUN
up there, (there's no way to port up - or out unless you get incredibly lucky
and there's a high level wiz / druid in the zone, which is rare), then the dumb
quest is going on... AGAIN!!!  And I've only known of a few people who said
they were able to make it END.  Otherwise you have to wait til they do
"maintenance" and put it back to normal.  Really sucks.  Bad.
