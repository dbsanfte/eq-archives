Aye, I saw it too 42.  As a woman, I sometimes appreciate this chivalrous
approach, and sometimes hate it.  

For example, my husband and I (eek, the dreaded married couple team!) had
a disagreement waaay back when with a guy who had invited us to be
officers in his new guild.  I became more and more frustrated with what I
was and wasn't supposed to be doing, and eventually left, but not before
explaining why I wasn't happy. My husband was in agreement with me, but
I'll admit I was the one who was the most vocal and concerned.

Fast forward a year later, and come to find out that this guy has issues
with my husband, blaming him for being an asshat and telling people that
my husband tried to take over his guild, but thinks that I'm A-OK.

Hello?! I was the one trying to take over your guild!! Pah!
