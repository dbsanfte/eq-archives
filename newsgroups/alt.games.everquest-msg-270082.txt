No. They think its a simulated world, with a massive amount of other 
people in it. You know: like the "real world"... of course, in the real 
world one doesn't have to form a group before one can accomplish 
something, where one can even live like a hermit.

There is nothing implicit in a game that supports a world full of people 
that suggests mechanics should also force them to interact.
