 in OOT the nearest you get is sister island when you use the gnome from 
freeport ... after that it's a long swim across pretty much the whole of the 
zone ... never noticed a break when I swam there, although it was a few 
patches ago ... but I did speak to a low lvl in OOT the other day who had to 
go to the island with the goblins for OoW task and he made it ok.

try deleting the OOT files and re-patching them ... shouldn't take too long 
:)
