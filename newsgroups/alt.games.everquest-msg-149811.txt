Hmm i had a similar problem, only i saw all bearformed shamans and wizard
flappys as naked bald male models.

I think the solution had something to do with turning off cached textures in
prelogin options, then deleting all cachefiles from EQ directory there was a
bunch of files that where at 0 up to 100 bytes large that you deleted and
then i was set to go, i should have saved the log from my talk with the CS
rep, but i dunno where i saved it atm.
