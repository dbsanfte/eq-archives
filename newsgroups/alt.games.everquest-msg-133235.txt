I have been wondering for some time now how the AC pans out.  That's
armor class, not some one eyed doof or a guk dwelling reptile.

First, I would like to know exactly how the AC is calculated.  From
personal observation, I am led to believe the following:

AC = (base AC + sum of armor + sum of buffs) * (defense skill mod)

This is guesswork, but seems to be apparent when equipping gear with
AC and seeing the AC go up more than what was advertised for.



Second, how does AC affect the bottom line in a fight?  Is there a way
to measure it?  I would suspect it is some insane equation that is
hidden in server side code.  Has anyone done any solid testing on it?



Third, is the cleric line of AC buffs at all worthwhile?  The level 49
AC buff costs a whopping 300 mana to add only 32 AC for 72 minutes! 
Without external mana regen and having a med skill of 250, that's 2
minutes of med time per cast.  Assuming a high defense on the castee,
the total AC added when cast is 50-ish, what good does it do on a tank
with 1200+ AC?  I have seen the argument to have it up on those in the
group wearing tissue paper for armor, but seriously, will that much AC
really help if they've angered a mob to the point of peeling it off
the MT?  (note: see my second question above, and enchanters excluded
from this last statement)

I would say I haven't really noticed a difference when I cast it on
members of the group.  The only obvious use I have seen is for PL'ing
the lowbies where that much AC actually matters.
