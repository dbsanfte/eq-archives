I guess I owe you all a big apology for disrespecting your freedom. It would
be a major understatement to say that God and Satan have been fighting over
my soul the last 2-3 weeks, perhaps there is a battle going on for your
souls as well? Anyway, I don't know who the 2 final prophets are but I know
that God doesn't want me to throw my life away over this, if you want to
learn about Biblical prophecy there are plenty of avenues you can check
into.

I feel that nearly everything I did and wrote on here was influenced by
Satan, and possibly also due to pharmacological problems and my own
imperfect nature. There may have been a few things I wrote which are
actually true and divined from God on the other hand as well. I probably
deserve to be thrown in prison but hope that I am not as I feel that I
deserve to make one mistake in life, and I guess this was it. Well, most of
my life has been one long mistake, whose hasn't?

Anyway, a real Christian if they felt the world was screwed up or the end of
the world was coming, would watch, pray and wait. I don't know the verses to
show that but I have read them before and I know that the best thing a
Christian can do in times of adversity are try to find other Christians to
fellowship with, read the Bible, stay out of trouble, stay in school, work
etc.

What I have done here was not totally bad, but was not good either, and I
can only assume that God meant for it to happen as everything is
pre-destined, so I can only look at it for what it is, try to mature a
little as a result with what I have learned which is a lot admittedly almost
like this was all for my own benefit instead of yours and move on.

So let's see what would I like the last thing I communicate to be. Basically
that I believe we are in the end times and that the antichrist's last name
was Ribera. I think you have about 3.5 years to accept God and live your
life his way, which I must assume is very hard to do as I am just starting
to do it now myself and most people who know me think I am pretty decent so
it's not an easy thing to do at all.

So here is Ecclesiastes 7, hope to see you in heaven


Qoh.7
[1] A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than
the day of one's birth.
[2] It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of
feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his
heart.
[3] Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance
the heart is made better.
[4] The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of
fools is in the house of mirth.
[5] It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the
song of fools.
[6] For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the
fool: this also is vanity.
[7] Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the
heart.
[8] Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient
in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
[9] Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom
of fools.
[10] Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than
these? for thou dost not inquire wisely concerning this.
[11] Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them
that see the sun.
[12] For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of
knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
[13] Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath
made crooked?
[14] In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity
consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that
man should find nothing after him.
[15] All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man
that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that
prolongeth his life in his wickedness.
[16] Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why
shouldest thou destroy thyself?
[17] Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou
die before thy time?
[18] It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this
withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them
all.
[19] Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the
city.
[20] For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth
not.
[21] Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy
servant curse thee:
[22] For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise
hast cursed others.
[23] All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was
far from me.
[24] That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
[25] I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom,
and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of
foolishness and madness:
[26] And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and
nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but
the sinner shall be taken by her.
[27] Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to
find out the account:
[28] Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand
have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.
[29] Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they
have sought out many inventions.
