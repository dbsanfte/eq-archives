Worn attack is a bit out of my range atm, unfortunately.  With SV
and IoS on I only hit 1300 atk.  I'm going after some items with
slot type 3's in them in LDoN soon, then some Vengeane augs - but there
are other things to get in the meantime, and aa's and such.  Also,
I occasionally farm Natimbi for a bit in the hopes of getting the neck
piece, but it's hella rare and I'm not paying 200k for it in the
bazaar (if I had it :-P)  I'm going to be without really high attack
numbers for quite some time, so I think the 2.0 modifier is probably
very accurate for me.  I do, however max Str with focus on, somewhere
around 270 with IoS (No PP yet, so max is 280.)  I don't pay a lot
of attention to Str on items, it just comes.

Heck, a much bigger DPS increase will come from Golden Wraps of the
Compact (17/21) that only cost 115k (if someone will just buy some
of my stuff I'll be in striking range)
