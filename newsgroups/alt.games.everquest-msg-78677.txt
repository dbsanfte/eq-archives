Gosh, it really doesn't matter.  The stable area (to the left of entrance)
drops some epic piece (shammy I think) and the temple area to the right has
some good pulls, too.

It's a pretty easy zone.  The only thing to remember is this:  NEVER EVER
USE ANY AE SPELLS IN THIS ZONE.  No AE stun or mez, no AE snare, no AE
proc'ing weapons, NOTHING.  Ok, that's rather all-encompassing and quite
frankly there are places where it's perfectly safe (I believe the stable &
temple are safe but it's been a while) but in that zone it's best if you
just shelve those spells.  On the eqmaps maps by Kronus, the temple is on
the north side past the entrance.  The stable is the south side.
