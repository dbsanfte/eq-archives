Low-Mid end game is gone unless you have a regular set of friends to 
hang out with, or a guild with a lot of people in that range, or the 
ability willingness to solo/box.

High level game is pretty well populated, xp, gear and aa's are easier 
than ever which is useful because you need them to catch up.

It's the same EQ it's always been, you get no help from the game and you 
have to be pretty motivated, but there's a gazillion things to do.
