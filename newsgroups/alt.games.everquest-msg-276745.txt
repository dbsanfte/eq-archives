I'm always amused by people who discuss things with such familiarity, and
yet it's obvious from what they say that they don't actually have any
firsthand experience whatsoever.

For example...


> Mobs drop inordinate amounts of plat as level increases


I'd say that, on average, I got more plat-per-mob at level 35 than I do at
level 70.  In fact, 35-45 was pretty much the peak of mob-plat-dropping,
with mobs dropping several pp each.  It hasn't gone up from there, and in
fact has drastically gone down on average, with entire *expansions* worth of
mobs not dropping a single copper.
