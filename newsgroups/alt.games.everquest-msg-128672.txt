    Try and find out what guild on your server is the "top guild", and if
they're at the stage of doing their Vex Thal keys yet. One of the pieces
needed is off the Shik'nar warriors in Fungus Grove, and the best place to
camp them is in the room with the Warlord and the Royal Guards. Every Royal
Guard drops either a Chitinous Belt or a Brown Chitin Leggings, every time,
and you're there hours to get shards for everyone. Last time I was there
everyone left with at least one pair of leggings. So if you contact this
guild and let them know you're interested in purchasing some legs, odds are
they'll be able to hook you up with some.
