Interesting.  I have a friend with a 65 Enchanter and he says he
can never seem to fit all the spells he needs into 8 gems.

My druid and wizard are generally fine with 8 gems, often using
one of them as a "plan ahead" gem, where I pre-mem the buff I'm
going to need to refresh in a minute, etc.  But those characters
are still fairly low level, and I can imagine getting gem-tight
well before 65.

While I agree it's lots faster than using the book, I'm impressed
that you can do it in 2 seconds.  It usually takes me about that
long just to navigate the menu tree to find the spell.  ("Let's see,
is that a statistics buff, an HP buff, or a utility beneficial?")
Then there's the actual mem time, which is often another couple
seconds.  Sure, it's fast, but a lot can happen in those 4-5 secs,
not to mention the 4-5 secs when you try to mem back the other
spell.

The /memspellset command can help, but you're limited to 10 spell
sets.  Which means you either blow most of the 10 on single-spell
"sets" for fast swaps, or you put more spells in each set and then
you usually don't really want to switch all of them in the middle
of a fight.
