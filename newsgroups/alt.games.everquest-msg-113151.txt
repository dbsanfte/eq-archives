It pisses me off when a total stranger sends me a /tell for a sow.  Pisses me
off even more when I find out they are on the other side of the zone and could
*I* run to them or WAIT while they run to me.
Next time do the proper / polite thing:  "/Auc WTB a SOW for a long journey at
entrance to tunnels.  Paying 5 PP".
You will probably get a free sow, and you don't come off as "just another buff
begger".
