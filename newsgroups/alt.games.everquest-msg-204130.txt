This is because people are idiots.  With PoP making transportation easy, and
LoY adding nice group and player search tools, it *should* be easy to find a
group on any server.  But people just don't use the tools.

(And it's not just EQ.  DAoC has good group and player finding tools, and I
don't recall them being used that much).

Here's the way it *should* work:

1. At the end of your play session, you go to the Bazaar and camp.

2. At the start of your next play session, you do you selling of vendor
loot, buying supplies, and banking.

3. While doing #2, you are using the group tools to look for groups that
might need you, and chatting with friends and guildmates to see about
starting a new group.  If you start a new group, set the "group looking for
players flag".

If most people did this, it would be a lot easier to get groups.

Most people, however, do their selling, buying, and banking at the end of
their play session, and then often go to where they hope to fight next time
and camp there, maybe spending a while socializing before camping.
