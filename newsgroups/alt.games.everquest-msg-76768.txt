There are now 4 types of server :

1) "Blue" servers : these are the standard servers and are non player vs
player.
2) Red / PvP server : These are player vs playe (Duh!) and I *think*
that they all have zek in their name. Some of these have different rule
sets.
3) Anatonius Bale (SP?) : European server, hosted in the UK. This is
otherwise as per the (1) blue servers.
4) Frirona Veal (SP!) : Role play server. This has a very different rule
set. See the sony eqlive web site for details.

You are probably best off starting on a blue server to learn the game.
If you are in europe or play at odd hours AB could be good for you.

Ping time *should* be the same for all servers other than AB as they are
all hosted together.

The best you can do for player count now is sort by player count in the
login window. There has been some debate here about if this works or
not. The PvP servers are likely to be the lowest used so pick a server
near them in the list. Having said this over crowding is not generally
too much of a problem. (Nore is not being able to find anyone). The best
bet is if you know anyone who plays to join them on their server.

Human paladin is not a bad way to start. You get a few levels of pure
fighting and then get to play with some spells. Main drawback is that
you have no night vision. This could cause problems if you are looking
for your body after dark.

A couple more hints that I just thought of :

y.1) Get some help with hotkeys and how to assign them, they can make
your life _so_ much easier.
y.2) make your first hot key /loc then learn how to use the location
information. This should prevent you loosing too many bodys.
y.3) Get some maps from www.eqatlas.com these help. print them out.
y.4) Sense Heading will suck for 10 - 15 levels, but it does really help
once you get good at it. Start training now.
y.5) Dont beg etc...
y.6) Do NOT hand in the book that you start with to the Preist of
Discord. This will screw you up. Distroy the book. keep distroying it
till you hit level 4 (or is it 5 or 6 can't remember)

HTH,

Jim
