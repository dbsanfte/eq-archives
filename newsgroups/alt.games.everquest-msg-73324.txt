Because he's DT!  I still haven't figured out the logic, but it probably 
goes something like this:

Given that all lizards are reptiles, and therefore all reptiles (including 
those that may be amphibians) are lizards.  Trolls have green skin, like 
frogloks, which are amphibians, and therefore reptiles, so trolls are also 
lizards.  If trolls are lizards, then it must be a joke.
