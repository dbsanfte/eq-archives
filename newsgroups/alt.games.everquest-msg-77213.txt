Ok i think i see whats going on here.  Your account is registered for kunark
as well as sol right?  your problem is that you dont have the software
installed on your new computer.

here is what I did.

I have one computer that i installed kunark, velious, and sol on.  I
registered for all of the above with my cd's.

My wife got on and registered for all of the above using my software and her
keys found on her cd's so we wouldnt have to install everything twice.

it works just fine.

so what you need is the kunark software and that is it.
