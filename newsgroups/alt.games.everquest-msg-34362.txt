  That's because EQ is a PvE game.  PvP is sensibly restricted on the
"blue" servers.  You can do (or try to do) the things you described on
Sullon Zek, and more.

  There are still ways to play an evil character without ever doing
anything PvP.  Kill "good" NPCs.  Roleplay.  Refuse to cooperate with
good aligned characters, or do so with only extreme bitterness or
reluctance.  Or, assist your characters' enemies, but have a
condescending attitude about it.  "Poor little Paladin of Quellious
needs help killing the big bad bear?  Very well, I shall add my superior
strength to your weakness so that you may survive, for now."

  Yep, RPing is pretty much nonexistent.  I'm a big fan of RPing, but I
pretty much quit trying to RP in EQ after about 2 months.

   Yep.  EQ is about gaming, not RPing, and the mentality people have
reflects this.

  Sounds almost like you're describing Sullon Zek.  From what I've
heard, though, SZ is hardly a bastion for roleplay, though.  EQ just
isn't built for RP, no matter which way you cut it.
