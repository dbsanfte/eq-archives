MObile OBject, was first used to describe anything living thing (NPC,
Monster etc) which was controlled by the dungeon master.  Way back in the
good old days of paper roleplaying games.
Also it is interesting to note that the instruction manuals for MOST older
3D Design and Sim engines describe a Mob as anything which moves and is not
under the control (Direct or Indirect) of the user of the program.
(Maybe the programmers were avid D&D fans :-)

I remember this definition from all the way back in 1990 when I used my
first 3d Design package in College
