Yeah maybe thats my problem
Theres always been the lets get to the next set of spells mentality 
rather than just enjoying playing the class for what it is.
Now i have all the cool spells i wanted, snare invis levitate etc it 
just seems like theres nothing else to aim for.
Surely there much better nukes, ae and other things than a level 35 wiz 
has been theyre just upgrades of what i have already
At 65 ill do 2700+manaburn bonus damage and at 35 i do nearly 400
But to the mobs i kill at 35 400 is a lot of damage! so its just really 
an upgrade to allow me to compete at whatever i need to kill for that 
level
Im not really sure if i do enjoy playing a wizard anymore
I know i would absolutely loath a meleee class after level 2, ive always 
played spell casters in rpgs and that will never change
Maybe i need a break from the game or something
