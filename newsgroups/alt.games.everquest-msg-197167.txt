That's one way of looking at it, and certainly before I got my pet I
resorted to root rotting shrooms in DSP.

That's as dull as dishwater, though, and once I reached 34 I ended up with
the following:

* Cast pet
* Have haste on self and regen up. If mana permits, also have AC and STR
buffs up.
* Pull with slow
* (Optional) Cast a DoT while the mob approaches - disease if a tough one,
poison if the fight is shorter.
* Melee away. In the 30s, Shaman melee is more than adequate if used with
slow and haste.
* If it looks like going bad, root the mob and retreat. The pet won't keep
the mob occupied for long, but it'll last long enough for you to heal
yourself and get back into action.

I kept that up into the late 40s, by which time melee types really pull away
in terms of damage dealt. Those shrooms in Dawnshroud were also great for
raising weapon skills, as I went from a 2HB skill of 30 to 140 or so over
the course of two levels.

I'm now at level 50, with offense, defense and the weapons skills all at
200 - and yes, it was worthwhile for me at least. Of course, I'm not a tank
and my tanking days in groups are over, but in a group in the Plane of
Justice I can take quite a pounding before getting worried.

However, I know this is a whole can of worms (WIS shaman versus AC shaman,
for example), so I'll shut up now! :)
