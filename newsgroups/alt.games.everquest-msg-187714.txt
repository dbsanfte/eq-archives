Kinda funny you mention that. My warrior on test just hit 50 and I was
comparing her to my warrior on tribunal WAY back, before Kunark, when
SHE got to 50.

Today's warrior has about 250 more AC and 600 more hp, along with a
weapon that is grossly better than anything available then even after
the planes were put in. 

If only I could put Lorianne back in time. She would be a GOD in those
days! Best tank on the server - and as a GNOME! I'd be the first in on
EVERY Nagafen raid, yessirree....
