DKP systems are fine if you want to tie participation to loot awards
exactly. The problems come in that people try and cheat points and that the
value of equipment changes all the time.

Equipment rots happen if equipment is priced too high . If too many points
are awarded then eventually you get the case where only part of the people
can ever bid on equipment.

If you use a bid system you will do fine usually but it is a major hastle
for the one running the system.

If you dont feel particularly capitalist which from previous experience I
know many people dont :) Try just the loot list method . Whoever asked for
the item and has gone the longest without an item gets it. Just requires you
to keep one list and is very simple , works well too. It is a socialist
system that taxes the rich while providing for the poor but socialist
systems work on the small scale where you can kick the weenies out of your
social structure if they wont behave.
