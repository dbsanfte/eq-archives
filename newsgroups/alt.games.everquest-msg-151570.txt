Warrior's higher HP and defensive disc do matter when the shit hits
the fan and everybody is too busy keeping the crowd controller alive
to heal the tank.  And as for damage, your higher offensive melee
skill caps matter a lot, a Paladin whiffs significantly more often
than a Warrior.  In general, I'd much rather work with a Warrior than
replace one.

SKs get some very nice spells, Invisibility plus Feign Death allow them
to do some things Paladins can only dream of.
