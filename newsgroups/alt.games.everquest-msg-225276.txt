Haste spells with buff components (like augmentation) stick to a BO'd
mage pet - BUT only the highes haste takes effect, although the agi
and other buffs apparently work.

I'd also swear I've seen a shaman haste buff on Spike at the same time
as a burnout spell - but it was when you still used /pet report health
to see buffs.

Basically I just tell hasters to save their mana - BOV is 85% haste, with
a muzzle of Mardu (11%) the pet is at max haste.
