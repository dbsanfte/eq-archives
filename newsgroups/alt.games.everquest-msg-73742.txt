Houses as some kind of a reward for success in the game would be nice.
People
are buying horses not just for their speed but as a status symbol. I think
that houses
would be a good idea for the same reasons, but obviously you wouldn't want
people
to be able to build houses just anywhere (and I doubt their grahpics engine
could
cope with such a dynamic world anyway), but having new zones attached to the
cities where you could buy a plot of land and build on it might be a nice
idea.
