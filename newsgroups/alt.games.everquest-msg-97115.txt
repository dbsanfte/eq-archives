"...that violate a previous rule". Not quite up to par on your

"Clearly" to you. "Clearly" to you is not necissarily "clearly" to
everyone else.

Time, yes. But what about the setting? Sorry, Norrath isn't England,
Rome, or any of those other places.

Bottom line is, however, the rules are interpreted by the GMs. It is
their call, not yours. "Xtermin Ator" was a clear effort to slip in an
"iffy" name and. If you have any doubt whether the name you choose is
acceptable, why chance it? Last call as to whether a name is allowable
or not isn't yours.
