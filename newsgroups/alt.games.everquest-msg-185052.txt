I'm running a GeForce4 Ti4600 that I've had since mid-last year and EQ 
still slows down a lot. In the Bazaar I turn down the draw distance to 0 
and it still has a choppy frame rate (and I don't 30fps compared to a 
usual 60 or anything, it drops to like 10 or 15, though I don't have a 
reading for it to know for sure). I recently took a trip to the Plane of 
Knowledge for the first time and that city slows me down a hell of a lot 
as well.

Not to put down video card manufactures or the developers of EQ, but 
shouldn't there be some way to fix this? Morrowind slows my video card 
down as well, but not like this. Is the graphics engine in EQ outdated 
to the point where as much as they can do with it now still will not 
improve it to current standards? I realize there comes a point when 
overhauls simply aren't enough, you must start anew with an updated 
design and work from there. Is this the cause of EQ video slowdown?
