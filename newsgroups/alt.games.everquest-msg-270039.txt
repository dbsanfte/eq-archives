However, I think the important thing to notice about the XBox Live mode is 
that, according to how it is written in the article, if you reach the 
threshold of complaints on XBox Live, you are banned from XBox live, and 
thus, from all the games that you play online. This would be comparable to 
being TOSsed by your ISP and, as a result, getting banned from *all* ISPs 
you have access to. I think that hreat would do quite a bit towards keeping 
griefers out.
