Or just click the icon off out of your buff box.

My shaman clicks off both his mount icon -and- Fungal Regrowth icon, and
clicks his Black Fur Boots... all in all, there's a definate delay in

Of course I generally only have several unslowed mobs trying to chew my
limbs off when I decide to run, not a hasted buffed former pet.
