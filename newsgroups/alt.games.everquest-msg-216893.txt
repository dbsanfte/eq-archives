Pop-outs won't do any good.  Keeping the window open 2 inches will only
lower the interior temperature by about 8 degrees.


Saw some nasty little stats a while back.  Here's some miscellaneous bits
(various sources, so varying levels of detail and accuracy):

Canadian Driver:  95 degree day, interior temp of small car will hit 122
inside 20 minutes, and 150+ inside 40 minutes.

InjuryControl.org:  Both dark and light-coloured vehicles, 93 degree day,
both vehicles exceeded 125 in 20 minutes, and 140/138 (dark/light) in 40
minutes.

co.yuma.az.us:  95 degree day, interior temperature will reach 145, steering
wheel 159, seat 162, dashboard 181.  On a 79 degree day, car with white
interior will heat to 135, car with black interior will heat to 192.
