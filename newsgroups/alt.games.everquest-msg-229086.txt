IIRC, it actually was at one time, but they nerfed it because the zone
became too crowded. At least, that's the story I've heard. Back in the
day, I hadn't been playing long enough to pay much attention to things
like ZEMs. Scarily enough, even with the low ZEM, you can level
decently there in the mid-20's due to fairly constant and easy pulls.
Especially with the low PC population now. Combining the easy-ish mobs
and constant "pullability" with a high ZEM was apparently decided to
be too much.

Curious, considering Paludal now days...
