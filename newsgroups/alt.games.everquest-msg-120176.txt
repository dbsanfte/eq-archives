I don't remember you confirming whether or not your friend actually
turned off attack first.  An unhappy ping will give you 100 percent
failure if you don't wait after turning attack off.

It's obviously because the Cyclops has a GIANT ALL-SEEING EYEBALL that
sees past your friend's pitiful feign ability.  I believe the guide was
blowing smoke up your arse about mobs that are "unfeignable".  Sometimes
it just doesn't work but I've *never* come across a mob that I couldn't
eventually feign off if I was doing everything right.  I know for a fact
I've feigned off the same cyclopi in RM that you're refering to.
