    This is bollocks. I'm not reliant on a group, but my solo XP rate is
still half what a fair group can pull in (half an AA yellow per hour, versus
the "this group is good enough for me" one AA yellow per hour). Given the
choice, I'll always want a group over soloing, and given a choice of tanks
I'll always prefer a warrior over another class with Taunt. No, a class
without that Taunt button is not acceptable to me for a main tank.

    I can do things with a warrior in the group, like not heal him and look
after others first when multiples are pulled, that I could not do with other
tanks due to lower HPs. The warrior can also make his HP pool effectively
MUCH larger with a single /disc Evasive. Except in very rare circumstances
(like versus the undead) I'm not relying on the main tank's DPS to kill
things since all the plate tanks have cruddy DPS, so I don't care how bad
you are at that. =)

    That's a HP differential thing. Warrior gets beaten up just as hard, but
they have a larger pool of HPs to pound through before they take the dirt
nap. During that extended time, a cleric can get off a heal to save them.
The point the warriors make is that at the endgame, the percentage
difference between a best-HP monk and best-HP warrior is small because they
both have 125 HP items in every slot nearly. They also feel that having a
Taunt button is useless for holding aggro, and that sustained damage output
(like a monk has and a warrior doesn't) is the best way to maintain aggro.

    Without a cleric?!? Hopefully no group is doing THAT!! ;-)

    Again, I'll make more XP grouped with you than I will alone. The same is
true for you grouping with me, unless you can mitigate/heal very well. I
don't see any reason for a cleric to turn down that grouping for reasons of
efficiency.

    Paladins and Shadow Knights are useless to a rotation no matter what
they have, so that would seem to me to be a barrier to participation.

    Our findings, from hours upon hours in VT, are this: we have paladins
and shadow knights as MAs for most of the hall trash. They gain aggro
fastest, and they can stand the pounding. For Eoms, warriors offtank because
only they can handle an unslowed Eom and live. I believe they also try and
gain aggro on certain Plis (Senshali and Centien IIRC) as well due to damage
output.

    When it comes time for a boss, warrior MT always. Depending on number of
clerics and warriors present and how redundantly safe we wish to be, we may
have a warrior, shadow knight, or paladin RT if one is required. We've had
an enchanter RT one of the easy shadow bosses, so it really depends on who
is there and what we're facing. ;-) Against anything with real damage
output, the RT is a warrior if we have one to spare. The first warriors in
the MT rotation are ones with AoE Taunt, then ones with no AoE Taunt but
with EB weaponry, then the ones with none of the above. We've had warriors
that handle aggro fine that lack AoE Taunt, but not ones that lack EB
weapons.

    Give all your warriors the Call of Sky-style items from VT. One of our
main tanks has the gloves, another has the orb. No matter what weapon they
are forced to use to hold aggro, they have that extra DPS and especially
extra hate going off. I've seen other guilds not on points systems give
those items to monks and rogues to up DPS, and in my opinion it's a horrible
mistake. Just like you make the effort to get Brilliance of Ro items in the
hands of debuffers and casters with spells that'll scale post-60.

    Actually, what you're about to see is a reduction of the Evasive timer.
As it stands now, at level 65 you will be able to stay Evasive non-stop -
three minute duration, three minute timer in PoP. There's your inherent
damage reduction. The only question is how you'll be able to hold taunt in
that situation. Right now, procs are your best bet because your actual blows
won't be landing as often. Depending on how you view proccing items
(artificial prop versus "natural progression of the class"), that could be
good or bad.

    Hmm, are you sure about that? We saw a link last night to an unreleased
item with 150 HPs. Could be that was just the first test, though.

    This can be changed in PoP very quickly. The only issue then becomes
stacking, and whether the new HPs added force the warrior to give up other
desirable traits.

    XP situations? No real use for a second warrior if you're being
efficient, but lots of classes (like cleric) suffer in exactly the same way.
On raids, having redundant warriors can be the difference between coffins
and loot calls. One little hiccup (like yesterday, when channels went down
just as DXXV was incoming) can eat that first tank fast.

    I think the way that tanking has been divided by class changes is
nothing short of brilliant. Paladins and Shadow Knights have been given the
role of offtank due to their quick-aggro skills and are better at it than
warriors, so they have a raid-useful role (which they completely lacked in
the past). Some tweaking is needed so warriors can hold aggro once they get
it on a big mob, but I don't agree that major changes are needed. Warriors
aren't the only defensive tank in the game, and changes shouldn't be made
that would make them the defensive tank of choice in all situations.

    In XP groups, warriors are as useful as their competition. They
outdamage the knight classes, they are more efficient tanks for cleric
healing (but less efficient for non-clerical healing). They lack the
flexibility that knights have with spells, but depending on group
composition the knight's spells could be redundant and useless. They don't
stack terribly well, but neither do the knight classes. Conclusion:
depending on group makeup and choice of target, a warrior is just as useful
for XP main tanking as the other two usual choices, paladin and shadow
knight. So where's the problem there?
