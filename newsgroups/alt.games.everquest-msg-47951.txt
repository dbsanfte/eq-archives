Wow.  This thread has certainly grown far beyond any point I thought it
would have.

Let me explain, that I am here only to participate in the many subjects that
are taken on by many other persons.  I am not here to participate in the
"flaming" and otherwise childish arguements that may or may not take place
in this newsgroup.

Just because you, as indicated above, "Decline" the EULA, doesn't mean that
the copyright laws still exist for that software.  If it came to a court of
law, you could not simply act (or anyone else, remember, this entire time
I'm NOT pointing at just you, only anyone with your thought process, which
we know as fact, you are one of them) the fool in court and say "Well, I
didnt accept the rules, so they do not apply."  WRONG.

I am all the while talking on a "technical" aspect here.  If you are certain
that I am incorrect.  Please show me copies of court rulings and/or
documents with references so that I may become a more informed person.
Otherwise, the EULA is clear and ignorance is rarely if ever (especially
software, music, or many other type of medias) an acceptable excuse.

I will watch for a reply with those court rulings and/or documents with
references, otherwise, I am going to cease participation in this thread
since it will only be a forever "nah uhhh" and "yess huhh" type argument
with not substantial support to go with anything.
