On the subject of necro gear, ummm... 
[*cough* TWINK *cough*]
Not that I know anyone like this, mind you, but let's just say
hypothetically that somebody was playing a low level necro that
obviously couldn't hunt/quest for much on their own, but they happened
to have a higher level character as well. Let's say a ...... ummm....
oh, a 51 warrior with access to a nice group of other 50+ players to
hunt with. And let's say this hypothetical person was considering maybe
picking up a few "nicer" items for their necro.

What would you get for the necro that wouldn't be too much of a end of
the world, bleed from the ass camp/quest etc.? Also, aside from the
obvious player made jewelry to max out INT and mana, any items to shop
for in Feymart and EC that would really give a young necro a leg up in
the world?
