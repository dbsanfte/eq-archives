J. J.,

You write:
> it says "Triggered."  What does this mean?

It means each time you want to use one of your 9 remaining
charges, you must put on (equip) the bracer (on a wrist
slot), stop moving, target yourself (F1 key), and then
right-click on it from the inventory window. You should then
see a spell-casting message and a new buff should appear in
your buff list. By the way, you've already managed to use it
once since it begins with 10 charges.

> How do I recharge it?

Most items with charges in EQ aren't meant to be recharged.
There was a thread earlier about how you can recharge an
item if you have two identical items, one full of charges,
and the other empty, but this process would be too expensive
to be worth it for this item.

> And most of all I have not found a Web site that answers
> these kinds of questions.

Most of this kind of knowledge is either passed along in the
game from person to person, or across message boards (like
this). You might be out of luck for finding a site with this
kind of info, but you probably won't need one anymore anyway
in the near future.
