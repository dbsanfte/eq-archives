Since the most recent patch, when I go LD a popup box comes up asking if 
I want to send a report to SOE.  If I say yes, I crash the rest of the 
way to desktop.  This has happened several times (I'm going LD on zoning 
still about one time in three, like always since LDoN release).

Today it happened and I clicked no in the hopes this would work out 
better... I still crashed to desktop, but now the error reporting 
process stayed with me and locked up.  Cancelling that got me a 
microsoft reporting the error with the error report box, which ALSO 
locked up.  What fun!

Anyone else seeing this or is it just me?
