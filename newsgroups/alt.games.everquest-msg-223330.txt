Ah, never had it explained quite that way and have never experienced it. I
guess the people I've adventured with are experienced enough with what
you've described to be able to avoid it. Thanks for the explanation.

Ugh, that's awful! Anytime you have to force players to choose an option
they don't want by making it unpleasant not to, there's something wrong with
the design... But seriously, my experience has been that although the
annoyance arises, it's usually enough to move people off their first choice,
but not necessarily enough to force them to try something they're dead set
against. So, for example, no group I've ever played in would accept a Rescue
mission, it seems to be the only category that everyone agrees is not worth
playing. The one time I played one was because it was chosen by accident,
the chooser *thought* they were getting an assassination.
