  Are the players on the line of scrimmage or are they allowed to stand in the
end zone and wait for the qb to pick a pass??

In football your not allowed to be beyond the last defender before the ball is
passed. In NFL your not allowed to leave the line before the ball leaves the
ground. Same rule different wording.
