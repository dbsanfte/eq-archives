Sorry, still not needed.  Those spiders have very small agro ranges,
and -- here's the best part -- they're ranger-types.  Yes, they *can*
and *do* SoW themselves.   So getting by them doesn't require a
SoW, because they might be able to outrun it.   And, even if they
don't, they can root you.   SoW doesn't help a bit when you're
rooted.  (Unless you consider standing in one place very quickly
while dying a help.)

You don't *need* a SoW;  you *need* to be careful.   A SoW can
substitute for being careful, or being careful can substitute for
a SoW.   All classes get "Careful" at level 1, but it's amazing how
many people never prime it and never see any skill increases.

But, if you feel that you *need* SoW for CRs, bind near a bank
and *buy* a SoW potion:  10pp/dose.   Keep it in the bank, and
you'll never have to bother anyone for a SoW again for a CR.
You'll find it's surprising how many "gotta have a SoW" situations
become manageable without using that potion....
