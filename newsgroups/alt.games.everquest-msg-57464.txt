Fight orcs in High Hold Pass. When you ding 20, maybe 21, move into the
Keep. You can stay there right on up to 30. Great exp, great loot,
moderate to high degree of danger. It can be tough getting a group
sometimes, just be patient.

Your soloing days are numbered, as I'm sure you've already figured out for
yourself.

Probably because they already have one in the group ;-) Trust me, HHP is
always looking for more warriors. One of the best groups I've ever been in
was when I was 18 in HHP - an 8 hour weekend exp grind with 3 warriors, a
monk, a cleric, and myself the enchanter. Talk about a mob-blender...
