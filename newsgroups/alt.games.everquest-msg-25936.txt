The general trend of your question seems healthy and interesting,
but reading between the lines, I think you have missed one of
the prime lessons of the game... -never- by anything from
vendors if at all possible.

Leather armor, if that's literally what your druid was wearing,
is a vendor purchase.  Likewise, chainmail is only available
from vendors.  There are leather type drop armors and
tailor made armors galore, but to my knowledge not "Leather"
and likewise there are any number of chain type armors
that drop or are made... but not "Chain mail"

Vendors charge -outrageous- amounts for what they offer.
The correlary is that they -pay- ludicrously low amounts.
If I were to sell you armor for twice what a vendor would
have paid, you'd still be paying a fifth what the vendor would
sell it back to you for.  Because of this combination, you'll
find you can readily afford markedly better items from
players than you'd ever be able to buy.

Even more interesting in many ways than the "drop" item
phenomenum is player made stuff.  The armor I'd reccomend
for you as an upgrade from random loot you've been wearing
would be Banded.  Generally this sells at 1pp per AC, so a full
suit of it head to toe would cost you around 90pp.  If that
sounds like a lot, price just the chain hauberk (shirt) at a vendor
sometime.  Further, you can buy pieces, rather than a full suit,
as you are able to afford it, and can often get -much- better
prices than 1pp per AC.  You see, someone working on smithing
will make the same item again and again, occaisionally improving
his skill until he can no longer learn anything from making that
item.  Normally he will (contrary to what I said above) simply
sell these off to the vendor, rather than taking the time to sell
say a dozen or two banded masks.  Offer to buy from him for
whatever the vendor would have paid, he'll like as not be glad
to see someone wearing a little of what he's producing.

Most clerics go with 1hb.  This allows you to carry a shield,
which at low levels means more AC, but more importantly
at higher levels will allow you to carry two items with stat
bonuses (one in each hand) rather than just the one.

Personally, I was a melee cleric till 44, using a very slow
two hander, which allowed me to sit between swings and
med just as much as if I hadn't fought at all, and to do
more damage per minute than many paladins of my level.
Three additional problems with this idea:
One: you are a wimpy high elf, while I am a dwarf who's
Strength for most of his life has been over 150
Two: its not the easiest thing in the world to continue
to do your cleric jobs well and add in melee
Three: at 44, you'll find that your nukes do so much
damage that you're better off doing that than meleeing,
and your skills stop improving while real tanks continue
to skyrocket, so that you'll become as useless at melee as
a caster, relatively speaking.
