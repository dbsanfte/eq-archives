in addition to using quotes, i have found that it's possible (takes a while
most times, but is worth it) to find out the number of the guild

every guild gets a number upon creation; these numbers are sequential (on my
server, 2 guilds were formed before the GM guild was created ["Order of
Fennin Ro"] hahaha)

there will be hundreds of guilds, but if you ask the older players / members
of older guidls, they'll be able to help you find the numbers for most
guilds

it's tedious, but once you have a list in front of you, you can check up on
all your favorite guilds


and btw, doing /w all "this is a guild name" does work for the most part,
but if it doesn't, and using just 1 'keyword' doesn't work, it sometimes
helps to use 2 keywords, as in /w all "this name" or /w all "name of silly"
....leaving out a few of the words, you see

good luck
