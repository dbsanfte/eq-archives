It is normal aggro not faction unless you kill them. I kill every
deathfist orc I see to raise my Freeport faction. Usually I pick them
a little forst and intimidate them for fun, then I backstab them.

Ways to advance:

1) I pick pocket green mobs and get skill ups. A Favorite is the
cockatrices in OT, but for your level use Deathfist pawns.

2) While fighting turn off auto attack and pick pocket the mob, then
turn auto attack back on. Make a hotkey for that. Punch it a lot, add
other skills as you advance like sense traps or sense heading. While
others med practice your skills.

3) Pick pocket mage pets, familiars, boats, spires, and soulbinders.
Soulbinders used to have all kinds of things on them. I have never
been attacked by one. You can also use these same things for
Intimidation practice. Again, while others med, practice.

You are a skill based class, like a monk, but more money and profit. A
lot more money. I recommend you save those pennies and buy a decent
piercer (for your level), like a walrus tooth, a Drachnid leg tip, or
a Crystal Grinder. There are better piercers, but I know those are
both cheap.

Nobody told me this as well, but, practice your 1h slash and 1h blunt.
You never know what decent weapon will come in that form!
