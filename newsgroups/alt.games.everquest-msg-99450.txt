There was a post with more info on these on the
mage compendium earlier - see my post with the 
link.  Also, someone there has Alan's post about
all this - not bad in what it says, and in what
it implies.  Everyone who is interested in the 
changes in general and the focus item changes in
particular should read it.  He flat out says that
one of the reason these things are summoned and
so easy to get the spells for is so there is very
little investment in them, so there is less impact
when they have to alter them.  I have no problem
summoning these things as a beta test of them, 
they're just too cool  :)
