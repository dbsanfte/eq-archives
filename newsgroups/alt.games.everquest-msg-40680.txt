    There aren't enough to fill every camp spot, and I'll even concede that
I doubt every item worth having will be camped. Do you want to be the one
porting around to find out where the uncamped camps are? It would be a whole
lot easier if we had /who all ZONENAME, but that'll apparently never happen.
Especially since giving us that would circumvent the removal of the /who all
count function.

    I spent this weekend, and last weekend doing eight hour plus XP camps in
Velk's to finally get level 60. I usually would either get in US (Upper
Spiders) right away, or camp-hop my way there, as the camp never disbands
and I could stay as long as I could play. Every time I was there, there was
a list to get in. If I was the one responding to a camp check, people would
ask to "get on the list". So, as horrifying as it is, lists still exist.

    Not that any of that is related to my point.

    James
