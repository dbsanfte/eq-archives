Yes, I'm actually doing quite well for myself money-wise, just from
selling looted drops. Mostly from the tons of adept I books and
tradeskill scrolls I've been getting while soloing group mobs.

While everyone else is out there fighting over critter nests and
rocks, I'm out there getting a couple good drops every hour :) I'll
open my store while sleeping and usually sell about 50-75% of the
stuff overnight.

I'm hoping I can get another Adept I Tellurian soon... Right now
people will pay anything for them :)
