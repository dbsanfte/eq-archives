Not quite: there is no "much later".  E.g., suppose you need 1000 XP for
an AA, and 3000 XP to level.  (Numbers totally made up, but they illustrate
the point).

Let's say you can earn 1000 XP per hour.

If you go 25% AA, then after four hours, you get an AA ding and a level
ding.

If you go 100% AA until AA ding, then 100% XP, then after one hour, you get
your AA, and then (assuming the AA doesn't change things), after three more
hours you get the level.  So, at the end of four hours, you have both the AA
and the level, just like the 25% case.

If you went 100% regular XP, then AA, it would be three hours to level, then
one hour for the AA.  Again, after 4 hours, you are right where the 25%
person would have been.

So, compared to the 25% setting, the 100% settings get one thing sooner, and
the other things at exactly the same time...not "much later".  (And, as you
point out, getting the one thing sooner might speed up getting the other).
