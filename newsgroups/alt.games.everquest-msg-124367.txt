<Graciously SNIPPED diatribe>

You're right -- "detention" for Jose Padilla is wrong.  That cocksucker just
needs a bullet in his head.  Even making a JOKE on an airplane or in an
airport about anthrax, a bomb, whatever, is just plain stupid and those who
think it's funny just need to eat some high-velocity buckshot fired from
close range.

How many oxygen-thieves will we need to kill for them dumbasses to realize
we're not fucking around?

Regards,

Matt
