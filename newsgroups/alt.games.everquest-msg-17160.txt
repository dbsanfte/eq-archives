Why not?  How is

	Them: /tell You would you like to join our group?
	 You: /r yes
	Them: invite
	 You: accept

or

	Them: /tell You would you like to join our group?
	 You: /r no

better than:

	Them: invite
	 You: accept or decline

It's not like a drive-by guild invite, where you get an obnoxious dialog
box you have to deal with.
