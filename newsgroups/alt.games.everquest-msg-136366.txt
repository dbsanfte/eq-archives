Minor Correction here: DEs can just run through FP and take the boat. The
hardest part is getting through Nektulous Forest in one piece. And they have
to avoid the caster's guild and bard guilds.

It's the trolls and ogres that have to run through Feerrrott and Da Swamp,
Oasis, and the Ro deserts.

Vah Shir also have a tough journey- Paludial is not easy to cross very
young.
