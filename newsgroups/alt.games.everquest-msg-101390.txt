Misty Thicket is good, RE is hairy but a fun first dungeon, the gorge is
great place to learn about weird pathing next, then comes EK and the gorge
hounds there and gnolls, and somewhere in there are the aviaks in Lake
Rathe, or the gnoll/undead camp there, and then Rathe Mts. That's my circuit
usually, not real busy, not real empty either, seems to be juuuuuust right.
