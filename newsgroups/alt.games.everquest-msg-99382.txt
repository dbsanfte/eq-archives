     That's been my experience as well.  The best way to keep your
pet alive is to let the monster hit you instead of it.  It takes
zero mana and there's no chance something will fizzle or not finish
casting in time.  You will NOT have the health free to keep Darkpact
running to get mana back quicker...but neither will you be spending
mana casting fizzly, 4-second Fear spells over and over, so it's
about even there.  Plus, if by some chance you take the boat rides
from the Oasis of Marr to the Timorous Deep to the evil race outpost
in The Overthere, you can buy the level 16 self-only necro damage
shield, Banshee Aura, and kill things even faster by tanking.

     Well, not "ensure".  Only if your DOT damage plus your melee
damage exceeds your pet's melee damage.  This gets harder and harder
as your pet and you both level.  The original poster will be fine at
his (her?) current level, but that will eventually end.
