+5 mana regen = 5 more mana per tick 
eg: Latent stackable clarity

+5% mana regen = each time you would've regenned 1 mana, you'll now
regen 1.05 mana
eg: for every 20 mana you regen per tick, you now regen 21

+5 meditate = 5 points added to current meditate skill
eg: A current meditate skill of 150 = 155 meditate skill

+5% meditate = each point in your meditate skill is worth 1.05 points
eg: a current meditate skill of 200 = 210 meditate skill

It clearly states the last option
