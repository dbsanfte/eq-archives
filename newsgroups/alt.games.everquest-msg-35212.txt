I've also been able to get out in win 95/98. What you have to do is
have your EQ res a DIFFERENT size than your desktop res. Next you have
to have same size in EQ OFF ( so that when you switch to inventory it
goes to 640x 480 full screen.. instead of that small screen with black
around it)

Then, last time I checked, you can still alt tab out. What you do next
is like hit ctrl alt delete if you have no mouse then hit "cancel".
Then you can do whatever, you then hit the minimized EQ on your start
bar to get back into it, whereupon it has changed to the other
resolution or something. Sounds funky but its really easy. It also
might not work with all graphics cards or drivers.
