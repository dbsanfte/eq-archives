This is the first complaint I've seen about the
blue bar by anyone who has played with it for
any length of time... or have you?

At early levels, you could easily see visible
progress in your gold bar for most kills and some
quests.  As you progress up, though, discerning
gold bar movement becomes more and more
difficult, in hell levels you may sometimes swear
that gold bar is moving in reverse!  The blue bar
addresses that nicely, by magnifying the gold bar
five fold, so that even 1% advances are visible.

Given that mobs con blue over a -vast- range of
levels at the mid to high end (yeah, at 40 I'm still
a lowbie in Velious) it is really nice to be able to
tell in a kill or three if what I'm doing is really
worthwhile or not.  Also, as you level up, you
may find yourself in parties composed of quite wide
level ranges; again, very difficult to tell if you are
getting any measurable experience while killing that
red to you mob with a party member 10 levels
higher than you in the group... until now.

Quests, too, now have a visible meter on the
exp side; for example I did the frost giant
toes quest in Thurgadin yesterday with my
level 40 cleric, hoping that here would be
a side bonus to hunting giants, but noticed
no movement despite reported experience.

Then I had my 19th level bard come and do
the quest, and saw a -very- small move; this
quest experience must be on the order of half
a percent of a level 19 bard's level.

Faction hits seem to be substantial, and there
is some sort of quest item involved which
seems to be only partially implemented, but
there seems to be little reason to repeatedly
do this quest for experience purposes.

I do wish they had picked a lighter shade
for the blue or a darker one for the gold;
I'd love some way to make it less tacky.
