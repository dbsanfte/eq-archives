There are usenet groups that are not flameridden. There are message 
boards that are not flame ridden. There are email lists that are not 
flame ridden. I do my best to not flame, though I will confess to having 
a long slow fuse and can rampage with the best of them. just because it 
is an 'open' forum, there is no reason why you cant behave in a civil 
manner. I seriously doubt that the heavy flamer/assh*les on the 
newsgroup interact in interoffice memoranda like that. I really doubt 
they act like that in personal emails to friends and guildies, and if 
guilded, I *really* doubt they act like that on the guild message boards.

There are a fair number of people on this list who are helpful and dont 
flame, Annie being one, though she can use sarcasm nicely to a turn. And 
as I said, *if* I had been asked nicely, I would most likely 
intersperse/bottom post. I dont know, if I were asked nicely at this 
time, I might change and become a bottom poster.

And since lately all I see is references to his saying that top posters 
are not caned there, that is what I am going by. I dont save newsgroups 
past 14 days normally. If there is a post with information I like, I 
copy it into folder to read and use later. If there is a link I like I 
will go there and bookmark it.
