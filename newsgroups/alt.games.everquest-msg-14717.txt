 Yeah me too... was auctioning for items in NFP the other day. One
guy was BEGGING for a GG to North Ro for almost an hour. People
kept /ooc'ing that it was only a few minutes walk but he just
kept on shouting for a group gate. I send a tell to him asking
just why he needed a gate to someplace so close but he never 
replied.
 
 Eventually I put him on ignore. What a moron.
