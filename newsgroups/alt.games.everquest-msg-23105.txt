Lake of Ill Omen - fear kite the sabretooths.

South Karana (would be my personal preference, I don't like Lake of Ill
Manners) - harmony pull aviaks to kite (that way you can pluck the
choice mobs right out of the treehouse using lev), move up to Tesch Mas
gnolls outside Paw at level 24 or so. Also, wandering centaurs etc. The
aviaks and centaurs are non-aggro and factionless, and both have in zone
merchants (slaughter them all, then sell their remains to their
kinsman)...

Both Aviaks and centaurs range from level 20 (egrets, foals) to level 30
or so (avocets, chargers/coursers)

Kite the centaurs and either ignore their annoying arrows (they don't
hit for much, unlike their melee hits), or root/dot them and move to a
safe distance to med (you'll probably want to wait until you have decent
dots for this - at 22 you'll be nuke-and-run kiting I guess).

Nice coin and drops in that zone too (ringmail and gems from centaurs,
Fine steel from gnolls, lots of words etc)

You could get up to 30-ish just outdoors in SK, then move over to
Velious for cougars etc...

Also, at 22, many wandering elephants will give xp. They are melee
hard-hitters in the same way that griffawns etc are, so are good to
charm as pets, plus you can fear kite them. Move from calves up to
regular elephants, up to bull elephants.
