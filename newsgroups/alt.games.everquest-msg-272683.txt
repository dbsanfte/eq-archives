Sure there is.  The slur makes the culprits less like "us", and therefore less
sympathetic.  The fact that a lot of selling is done by americans doesn't
matter.  Oh, and it also masks the fact that this point is basically unfounded
regardless; automated merchants are a feature unrelated to content expansion,
and even if they were, platinum gets pumped into the economy by game design
error rather than ebay.

Both are necessary for the problem, if it is a problem.  The base issue,
though, is that the game is flawed if a lot of people's fun can be ruined by
this activity. 

Personally, the bad effects I've seen have entirely been from exploitation of
bugs, and the biggest culprits have been weenie powergamers rather than
professional ebayers.
