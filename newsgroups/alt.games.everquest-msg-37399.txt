Ok... 39 cleric here.... Last eve I was in Unrest with a couple of
guild mates....   Having a good ole romp.
I get a tell from someone asking if I could Rez (I was on Role).
Me:  yes..(Foolish,honest me)
them:  can I get one
Me: Im in a group with guildies and cant now but when leaving I will
assist you.

Im in unrest and some other groups pull goes totally wrong... Numerous
skellys and hags come out and start hammering me.
one of the guildies with us was a little low and I tell her to run.
I take the train outside. and shout Train...
I zone with less than half a bubble life.
I get a tell from the same person,  what you doing now....
me: Im recovering from a train I didn't pull.
them:   yeah I got killed by it  (I took it as they ment I owed em)
me: bummer but IM OOM and low on life.
no response
few min later
them:  what you dong now
me: im trying t keep my group alive (one of ours had dropped very low
in health during my absence)
Them: could you rez me, its a long run (this just bothered the crap
out of me)
get things settled and tell group I am going to rez this guy so he
will leave me alone.
find his body... Rez... heal etc.... Medding... he want me to rez the
other body now too....
I comply  (yeah im weak I guess)
he then offers me the Dwarven Chain mail from Crush... (im level 39
don't need it, in fact have one already Lore)
them: oh you have one already..
Me: yep
they turned around and left...

Personably, twas my fault for doing this guy the favor... but holy
F-ing Shit....  
He could of at least offend 10 plat for the royal pain in the ass he
was....
Koldan I believe his name was... He as been black booked by me for
sure
He is on the Quellious server.


Hunt well and if asking for a rez... give at least something... (and
dont be a pain in the ass)

I dont rez for money... but I do play to enjoy myself.. this guy
sucked the life out of the moment for me.  Even after I told him I
would rez him but was with my group...


Peace
Quindell
