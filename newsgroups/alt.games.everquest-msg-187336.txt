So a 1 in that equation would change the equation (effectively) to:

XP=(group_bonus)x[(level_bonus)^2]x(high_level_differential_bonus)

A 1 would be a non-modifying modifier, in that it makes no change to the 
end result.

So if 1 isn't the default, what is? Since you categorically stated my 
assumption (based on sane coding practices) was wrong, I would assume you 
know the real default?

Tangential at this point :)

OK, bad example. 

I can know that as a circle gets bigger, it covers a nonlinearly-scaled 
greater area without knowing <pi>r^2.

Agreed on the proportionality, as I did not follow this entire dickwaving 
thread.

Aha! You're just kiting indefinitely!

Oops. I got locked into flame-mode and thought you were an anonymous James, 
since I think of you as Grahame. I have seen a lot of worth come out of you 
as well, and retract that statement.

I have no excuse. In fact, I wrote a damage modal/maximum weapon comparison 
CGI in Perl using the (unfortunately quite dated)formulae at monkly-
business.com that compares two sets of (2 onehanders OR 1 2hb) and decides 
which will be a bit better, based on factors such as your dual wield skill, 
your weapon skill, and your level (and thus damage bonus). I regularly 
parse my logs- I SMB mount my EQ directory on a Linux box on my LAN for 
that very reason. 

I am not strong in math, but I am certainly not phobic of it.
