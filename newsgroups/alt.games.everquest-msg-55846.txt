One of the best things I love about it is the ability to explore zones
unhindered for the most part. A great way to check out routes and paths the
MoBs take and see the static spawns. The monster choice is purely random but
sooner or later you will get to play a zone. I was a bunny in Stoneburnt Mts
and that was fun running around looking at stuff without every green MoB in
the place agroing on you.
