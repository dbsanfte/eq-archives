1) I stipulated that plat drops would be significantly increased.
Buying your merchant spells should not be problem.  You could also
hang onto merchant fodder a little longer if you need to buy somehting
pricier than you usually get in one session.

2) Weapon upgrades and highend spells which costs hundreds of
thousands of plat would switch to a barter system. That was the point,
to elminate plat as a major currency, to eliminate the temptation of
buying plat from yantis etc.
