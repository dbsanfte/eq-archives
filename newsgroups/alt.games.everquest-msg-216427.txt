The point is that the pathing changes were utterly undocumented, sneaked 
into the patch. A few weeks later, SOE finally admitted them.

What a load of shit this is. You can walk into a room, look around, and say 
"Oh, I bet mobs will aggro through that wall there on the north"? Right.

You aren't looking too deep if you think that's true.

They're a PITA. I prefer X Mobs ones, or Assasinate ones.

No, I just have learned that having one player in the group that puts the 
group at risk consistently is a bad idea.

I learned that lesson the hard way.

Oh, I'm sorry, that must mean you know the capabilities of his cleric 
better, including how many CHs he can squeeze off with 20m and all those 
other factors.

Really? What is healing aggro?

Yes, I am quite aware of healing aggro, as you'd have realized if you read 
my full post, notably "I med every second I am not casting, running, or 
avoiding sit aggro." By sit aggro I mean, of course, the likelihood that a 
mob that is freshly pissed by my heal will come for me the second I sit, 
not the propensity for some mobs(like Faydedar for example) that do not 
tolerate anyone sitting at all.

Nor do I.

I see. So now you are espousing wasting mana as a faster, more efficient 
method of grinding. Is this so you can get to your golden 20%?

Yes, I have done this too. In PoP with weakish tanks I have been known to 
drop a cele on inc, just to tide them through the first cheal while the 
slower does his thing.

OK, so lets look at the math here.

Assuming that a ranger takes the exact same DPS as a Warrior(cough)- let's 
make that DPS 100, just for the sake of argument. We know this is silly, 
the ranger DOES take more damage.

Now the hitpoint disparity: Lets put the ranger at 3k and the warrior at 
5k. This is reasonable, mid 50s.

Assuming that I try to land my CHeal when the tank is at 25%, and assuming 
that we have a perfect kill queue lined up (one always mezzed on the rocks 
and ready to die- IE the tank is taking solid consistent damage):

I will heal the Ranger after he has taken 2250hp of damage (every 22 and a 
half seconds, 10 seconds cast and 2 ticks of med). I will heal the warrior 
after he has taken 3750hp of damage(every 37 and a half seconds, 10 seconds 
cast and 4 ticks of med).

A CH is not a CH, and saying so proves you really are pretty ignorant about 
the game mechanics, math, or any of the other logical ways to approach your 
efficiency argument.

By contrast, if you have a Druid or something with no % heal, a tank is a 
tank is a tank and a heal is a heal is a heal.

I don't know, I'll tell you when I hit 62.

Meanwhile, Temperance costs me somewhere around one whole blue, and thats 
with MP3.

What is needless caution for you and your elemantal-geared twinks is sane 
gameplay for the other 90% of EQ.

Because Z is variable, based on different equations that are much more 
fluid. I NEED z*3, because when you bring in an add, or aggro management 
goes in the shitter, or the ranger has to step in for the LD MA, that spare 
z*2 will save my ass and yours. I don't have FT15 (14 to go on that), I 
don't have +med items, I sure as hell don't have a manastone... I need that 
buffer when the pull rolls in because I don't med as fast.

Yeah. I stay a fair way away from the tanks when I can, so I can sit right 
after casting and have time to get up if the mob comes for me. In thick 
fights with lots of adds, I stay close so the tanks can pull them off me 
with ease.

If he's as much of a prick as you, and as ignorant of the math involved, 
I'd count that as a blessing.

Note that mob difficulty is based on levels, not gear. In other words, LDON 
is much easier for you, because no matter where the scale is you are way 
above it. In other words, you are slumming by default in LDON.

Go spend about 40k on your ranger, and replace EVERYTHING on him with that 
40k. Then go through an adventure on Hard with him, with a group of other 
characters that are not uber twinked.

Then you can come tell the rest of us how to play.
