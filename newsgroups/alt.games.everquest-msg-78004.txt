My lvl 26 Dwarf Warrior (Atheist) has now had 837 positive faction hits with
Legion of Cabilis, would that make him able to walk unmolested in Cabilis
and
make his shoppingrounds there instead of the treacherous run through FV zone
(got killed oh so many times by those pesky drachnids, and boy are they
gonna feel payback when i hit 35-ish :). Or are there other factions that
would make me KOS or negative for shopping purposes in Cabilis?
