At level 22?
Not many ways. Money comes faster when you hit 30 and 40.

I suggest you do the bandit sash quest in qeynos. You kill bandits
in various camps in the karanas, lake rathe. Then turn in the sashes
in to qeynos.

Quest info:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=499

You get some cash and a bronze weapon for every sash you turn in.
Plus the bandits themselves drop bronze weapons as well.

I could usually make 40-50pp per hour doing this quest in my 20's and 30's.
Depends on how fast you can kill bandits.

Important!: don't sell the bronze weapons to the vendor right next to the
quest giver, he gives crap for the bronze weapons. Search around to several
vendors to see who gives you the best price.

Make sure you get a couple of opal encrusted steins (+25 charisma each, not
lore)
to sell all your loot with. This will save you tons of cash in the long run.
