	Well, why not do it like a "real" Dungeons and Dragons
quest?  Have a quest (that doesn't require a full group! but does
require at least three people) where a boss has a whole mess of
relatively low level underlings.  The higher level player goes ahead and
fights her way into the boss's chambers while the low levels have to keep
the underlings from reaching those rooms (sort of liek the spiders
in the MB raid).  The XP comes from finishing the quest not from killing
the mobs...  The rewards are level appropriate gear etc.  (And none of this
alternate currency crap, k?)

	Or have a dungeon where the central boss is a *weak* character
but the way in is guarded by mobs with "reverse aggro".  Instead of ignoring
high levels but aggroing on lower levels they do the opposite.  (The story
line explains this as something like "Your group mates appear harmless to 
the watchers".)  So the HIGH level has to stay outside and keep the powerful
mobs busy and make sure there's a clear path for the low levels return when
they kill the weak boss only they can reach.
