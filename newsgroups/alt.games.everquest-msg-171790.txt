I would have guessed this was an attempt at humour except that it appears
the author made effort to be serious, though not from the unbiased view that
was suggested.

Whereas I admire someone who does consider the consequences of his belief
and actions I find it disheartening that someone who is able to "think for
themselves" would fail to see how ludicrous many of the points made were.
For sheer lack of time I won't argue with you except to say that I am a
proponet of just about everything you have denounced and consider myself a
member of my viable and useful member of my community.

I play everquest, I enjoy what some might call porn from time to time and
despite your child-like innuendos I have sex regularly.

So as not to get dragged into an arguement that cannot be won by either
side, I just ask that you seriously look at yourself and at the world around
you and choose a life that you can look back on as worthwhile when you are
on your death bed.

These "end times" that drove your post are not truly that for time will
never end. This world as we know it will pass and so shall we all... I just
hope that not too many righteous people do too many well-intended bad things
to average joes who live their lives one day at a time.

Please feel free to email me on this at baram60@hotmail.com. Or don't.
Either way I can't change your mind and I scarcely think my existence will
be affected by such views as yours.

Let the end come.  I have lived my life as I saw fit.
