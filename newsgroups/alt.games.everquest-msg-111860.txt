Hey all,
Just have a few questions about what my role was/could have/should have been
when I had grouped last night.
First off, let me start by saying usually when I group, I have a real role,
and feel satisfied with it, however last night was different.
Stage - enter two Shadownights, one level higher than me (i was twenty at
the time) and another 2 levesl higher. They invite me to group with them in
Overthere, so I join up, buff with Skin like Rock, SoW, and Strength of
Earth.
First Pull - some animal than conned even to me, and it was hopelessly
slaughtered while I watched and medded. Suddenly, I realized they didn't
even need me there. I tossed out a bunch of heals during the night, kept
everyone buffed, but mostly was throwing around DD's.
I thought about damage shielding the SK's, but they weren't getting hit
enough for it to do much damage.
Is there anything else I should have been doing? Neither said anything, I
just sorta felt like the odd one out. Any other buffs I should have been
using? Anyway I could have been more mana-efficient? Or are druids doomed to
be great porters, and have to be second-third best at everything else?
Thanks in advance
Chaos
