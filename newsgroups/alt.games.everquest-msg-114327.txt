From what I've heard "deficit" just means it's an exp penalty that won't
remove your level. Think of it as more of a raising the bar to the next
level rather than lowering where you are now.

I nearly laughed myself off my seat when the guy who started this thread
suggested removing CRs and Exp loss from EQ for the rest of the levels after
10. I would NOT want to play that game, I can assure. No risk = no real
satisfaction = no fun. Of course, I don't buy items, I hunt/quest for them
myself or I am fortunate enough to have someone of a higher level bestow
upon me something useful (like that Skull of Jhen'tra a passing dwarf gave
me after I SoWed him in WK). I feel much more rewarded knowing that I got my
Bloodforge Hammer by pulling Trumpy Irontoe to the docks and killing him by
myself, it took two tries and I can never go anywhere NEAR Fish's Ale again,
but it was worth it. And I didn't do no /shout anyone porting to BB: I ran
across Antonica and camped the boat for 20 minutes.
