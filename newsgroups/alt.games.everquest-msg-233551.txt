@ndrew,

As Darren noted - not quite right.  Druid Ensnare can last 10 minutes unless
dispelled; the best wizard snare lasts two and a half minutes.  Wizard DDs
are faster-casting and usually more mana efficient, though.   Thus, druid
kites are ten-minute snare-DoT-DD sessions and wizard kites are two-minute
snare-BLAST-BLAST-BLAST sessions followed by eight minutes of medding.  :)
Of course, I did it before Flowing Thought and KEI were common, so Your
Medding May Vary.

Rhian,
65 Wizard
