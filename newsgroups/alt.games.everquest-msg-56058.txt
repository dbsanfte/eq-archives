No.

Sending in lots of petitions for the same problem DOES help because of
the way the petition que works. You should never assume that this guy
over here sent in a petition so all is ok. For one thing guides even
vary in their handing of issues. Also petitions are very likely
recorded possibly to see what people are petitioning about the most.
If you are the only person ever petitioning about something you look
like some crackpot with a sign while none of the other players seem to
be bothered by it.

Its a bit like report, if I report someone saying naughty things in a
zone its just one report but if 25 people do its a problem with that
customer and more noticeable and all reports are logged.
