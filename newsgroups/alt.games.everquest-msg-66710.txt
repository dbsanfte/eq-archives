Thats what Mark of Karn does.   Each time you hit it, you are healed a bit.

Nobody seems to quite know what Mark of Retribution actually does.  I can
confirm that it is not a lower level version of Mark of Karn.  (The cleric was
casting it tonight, and fighting with my inventory screen open showed that I
was not gaining health on each hit.)

One guess is that it might be a debuff that makes a monster take a few extra
points of damage every time a player hits it.   Another guess is that it does
a few points of damage to the monster each time the monster hits someone.  I
keep meaning to ask our clerics to duel me and put it on me, but I've
forgotten so far. : P
