    To expand on that: the entire zone (or rather the parts that you'll be
able to access) is a series of walkways connecting the odd house-like area.
The walkways have traps on them that spawn mobs. The mobs are almost exactly
as tough as PoV golems and spiders, right down to the silly procs. There may
be nameds to pull out of the house areas, but honestly most people don't
spend long enough here to find out. There are two unconfirmed tailoring
recipes from the zone, but they require a component which only drops in two
raid-only events in the zone. It might make an OK change from PoV, and I
always liked the music and mood, but it's a lot harder than PoV (limited
ways to run) for worse reward (no tradeskill drops of use).
