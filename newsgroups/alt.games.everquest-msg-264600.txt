A laptop labeled as Centrino has a Pentium M processor.  Pentium M
processors are nice.  They're roughly equivalent to a Pentium 4 that
is 1 GHz faster.

Example: A Pentium M running at 1.6 GHz is roughly the equivalent of a
Pentium 4 processor running at 2.6 GHz.  Don't be fooled into thinking
Pentium M's and Pentium 4's can be compared by their clock speed.

Pentium M's run cooler than Pentium 4's, so they put off a lot less
heat when running demanding games like EverQuest.  Most people
purchasing a laptop, including EverQuest players who intend to play
EverQuest on their laptop, should prefer the Pentium M-based laptops
over the Pentium 4-based laptops, as a general rule.
