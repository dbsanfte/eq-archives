Good for you, according to everywhere I've been, 125 is the cap, and from
personal experience I concur, however, since +50 skill caps got raised in
the past month or so, I can see how it changed, but the only thing I can
find specifically referring to druid tracking is the archived March 6 2001
patch message on Castersrealm at
http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3275 stating the cap has
been raised to 125.

Keep in mind this is TRACK that I say is limited, not forage, which can
indeed go higher than 125.
