Please pardon if this double posts.  I wrote the post but lost my connection
before it sent and when I tried resending it didn't show up so I rewrote it
and sent it a second time.

Oh believe me I didn't let him off easy on this whole thing.  I pointed this
out to him.  He was impatient and didn't want to take time out to research
items as he should  have.

 For starters item pricing is subjective, maybe the

Could be, but this guy seemed pretty savvy.  He was even running a casino in
the bazaar.  (yeah I know, told friend that should have been his first clue.

Like I said, there are other things that were said that lead me to believe
he had be purposefully deceived on this issue I just didn't go into them
here.

I didn't mean he can't trust ANYONE in EQ, or that I meant the EVERYONE was
deceitful.  Certainly I would be upset if someone painted me with that
brush.  What I meant was the he shouldn't assume that he can trust everyone
and that he should double check the value of items before he
buy/sells/trades with anyone, even a fellow guild member.

Agree completely.  What bothered me here, and the reason I said something,
was that is appeared to be a pattern and not a single occurence by one bad
apple.  I have never been in a guild that would tolerate this kind of
behavior and I was kind of shocked.  I know these young players can be kind
of a pain, but he's really a nice kid and very trusting.  I really hated to
see this happen.
