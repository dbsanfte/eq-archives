You're a fool, so I take pity on you and will explain one last time: go
to everquest.com. Click the store link -
<http://store.station.sony.com/> - realise it does not work. Follow
<http://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/http://store.station.sony.com/>
confirming it doesn't work for anyone.

Now feel like the brainless moron you should for utterly failing to test
whether I was right, and even failing to follow the links I gave
previously. Instead you choose to make a complete dickhead of yourself
in public by responding as if you were right and I was wrong. Opps.

FYI - I've already solved the problem - SOE failed to make their store
links secure ones - i.e. manually change the http to https and it works.
Pretty sad that all their store links throughout their station site are
broken as a result. But not as sad as your fail here. If only it were
shorter I'd submit it to failblog :-D

Have a nice day you pathetic little brat.

P.S. I'm laughing at you.

P.P.S. A lot.
