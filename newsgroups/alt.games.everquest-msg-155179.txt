But you are looking at it from the standpoint of someone playing
a cleric because he has to, who thinks its a healing tool, and a
boring one at that.  If you played a real cleric instead of a bot,
you'd be thinking outside the box more, perhaps.

You yourself, elsewhere in this thread, say that monks mitigate

Here, from a different part of the thread, you say:
================================================
My guild has rangers and rogues who can tank mobs that I do, and the only
way you'd notice a difference is by logging and parsing.  Im not saying
there isnt a difference, because with different skills/caps it clearly
implies there are (or should be), but at this level of the game the
difference is not something you can spot by observing the fight
================================================
Why not?  Because you have fewer HP but take less damage.
If you are using CHeal, then there is no difference at all.  But
my point is that "barring CHeal, barring disciplines like defensive"
monks take less actual HP count damage than other classes.

If you don't have a cleric around (you always do if you are botting
one) or if you are too low level/HP max for CHeal to make sense,
or if HP totals get up past the nerfed HP level, so that CHeal turns
into a partial heal, then this matters.  Monk and warrior lose
HP at 20% per tic.  CHeal hits warrior for 60% or monk for 100%.
Who do you want to heal?  If you don't have a cleric handy, this
math applies accross the board, you get more milage for your
heal on someone taking less damage.

It means she's worked out a way to do all those jobs adequately.  It
doesn't convince me she's doing all she can do with each character.
There's a difference between someone who is competent and someone
who is good.  There are so many incompetent players out there,
and so very many people become incompetent when botting, that
someone running three characters competently may seem like  a
miracle... but that doesn't convince me that she's running any of
the characters at peak efficiency.  You didn't, for example, say
that her cleric was meleeing, or stunning, or rooting, or keeping
abreast of cures, or doing anything other than sit and heal and
occasionally buff.  A bad cleric does those other things instead
of keeping heal and buff job done properly, a good cleric does
those things in right and proper situations on top of keeping the
heal and buff job done.

That monks take less damage than warriors, and are thus more efficient
to heal if you don't have a "complete" CHeal available to you.  Also,
being MA for a boss mob means using your defensive discipline.  What
about the 95% of fights in the game, where you are working your way
in to a boss mob, or aren't after a boss mob at all?  Can't burn defensive
on every single mob out there.  This is why I keep saying "barring defensive"
I recognize that a warrior with defensive up is a very different kettle of
fish.

You were getting CHeals.  You have fewer than 10500 hp total.  Thus
my entire arguement is moot; I never suggested that a monk was a better
MA in terms of use of mana under these circumstances.

They don't NOW.  They don't in circumstances where warriors would use
Defensive.  They don't with CHeal as the principle form of healing, under
current CHeal and HP totals.  In short, they don't under the circumstances
I specifically keep ruling out.

I'm saying that they take less damage in raw HP on a sustainable basis,
and so are better, more efficient heal targets for anything BUT a
CHeal which excedes the HP max of all targets.  No cleric available?
How about lower levels where HP totals make CHeal inefficient?
How about in a Balance situation?  How about with the coming
CHeal nerf and the coming HP totals boost with POP?

In short, is it possible that VI is looking at the future consequences
of their CHeal nerf and PoP expansion, and realizing that monks
are about to become gods, anticipating this by applying a fix?
People complain about them not forseeing the Manastone abuse,
the Donals BP abuse, so on and so forth.  Here's one they seem
to be on top of (well at least they recognize a part of the problem)

Its an aside.  An exception.  Not the main thrust of the arguement.
Put in solely to forestall people bringing up the rare case where
the opposite of normal is true.  Its not valid, no, but that
was my point; in rare cases you might see something topsy
turvy like this, but its rare and not the thrust of my arguement,
so please don't bring it up, yes, I already thought of it.

Depends on HP totals, the math is simple enough to do, figure out
the point at which CHeal does more HP per mana than other heals,
and there's your sweet spot... although its not something you want
to do regularly in a dangerous situation, where getting max efficiency
out of a CHeal means flirting with death.  Since an SK can FD,
they tend to be your best CHeal target if you can arrange to have
the mob not come interrupt the cleric while the SK lies doggo.

You miss my point entirely.  What if that ER is all you have?  What
if your best heal doesn't do "more than all the HP you ever thought
about having".  CHeal is certainly the god of heals, but believe
it or not, some classes don't get CHeal, and in the new high
end game, CHeal is about to become a spell just like ER in
its way; it will heal part of your damage.  Forget ER for a moment,
say you are down 7500 hp instead.  A warrior with 10000 hp
and a monk with 8500 hp both get 7500 hp out of the heal...
but for the monk its still a Cheal, for the warrior, it looks like
a druid heal does now, 75%.  If both got down to 10% hp
in the same time, you would clearly see that the monk  is a better
CHeal target.

Yep, yep, defensive breaks everything I'm talking about.  Which is why

I agree strongly with this.  AC is the problem, monks are just the

Again I'm not arguing this point at all.  Rogues and rangers should
sponge better than monks but not as well as warriors, paladins,
SK, bards, or clerics.  AC should matter.

I agree, AC is so very broken.  And I think its broken conceptually, at
all levels, not just at the high end of the game.  AC should always
matter, it should never be a "get out of fight free" card, but you should
be rewarded for getting more, penalized for having less, regardless
of your class, and regardless of the level of mob you are fighting.

That wasn't on your list.  There are only 3 rogues in your guild, but there
are lots of monks and lots of warriors.  You already have 3 monks in
your group, do you want 3 more monks, or 3 warriors?

I imagine at the highest level this ends up being true... I'm more and more
convinced its true over much of the 50s, even... but as long as I can
solo tank blues to death, its going to be hard to convince me cleric
damage is inconsequential.

Apparantly thats being done, although they aren't heralding that part

I very much agree, more AC should mean more mitigation, and less should mean
less.  Hard cap, and half the classes in the game capable of getting over the
cap, means that at the high end, AC becomes useless as a balancing tool.

It all is.  Only thing is, the point at which this starts happening is where enc
= str.  Since warriors are usually ungodly strong, they can carry around a heck
of a heavy kit out without it slowing them down appreciably.  Wonder why there
aren't more wood elf warriors out there?  Its because their low strength makes
them unable to operate in the heavy gear their class demands without severe
penalties.

I agree, 6% isn't near enough to represent a deliberately lightly geared man
trained in avoiding blows as practically his only means of defence, versus a
heavily armored man who knows full well that most blows are going to glance off
without scratching his paint job.

Well, you can... assuming the Fat Bastard isn't in good shape.  Someone in good

Well, I've always assumed as a baseline that monks have about 2/3rds the hp of
warriors, so your figures seem to be right in line.

Now, assume every cleric in your guild drops dead tomorrow.  Assume further that
in the normal run of things, both your monk and your warrior see their HP bar
drop at the same rate.  Who do you think your druids and shamen are going to
nominate as MA?
