Right.  Good example.  They didn't hate each other.  They had a degree of
mistrust that they eventually got over.  It is only the commoner that lives
his whole life hating another race.  The hero has enough something better
that he is able to rise above the ignorance.  Would you like to roleplay a
commoner, or a hero?  Obviously we play to become great ones, not fools.
