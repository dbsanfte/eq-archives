An interesting challenge, but....
my main character is a monk.  My hand to hand skill is maxed and I hit
(almost) as hard with bare hands as I do with my fighting batons.
Replacing the armour (mostly wu's) would take a while, but I would be fully
able to function.
(I imagine the same would be true of most casters)
