Just to confirm what others have said, EQ is *the* most lag-tolerant game
I've ever seen. 56k is just fine for normal gameplay - you can have a ping
of 3000 and the game would still be quite playable. 
Exceptions:
- if you're a bard, you can make use of better ping.. it's *not* to say the
game would be unplayable as bard if you had a bad connection, but it's the
only class where a good connection discernibly helps.
- if you're ever getting to high-end game (in 6-12 months of playing), where
people are raiding dragons and other uber stuff in groups of 30-50 people,
your 56k modem is gonna have some serious trouble keeping up unless perhaps
you're playing a pure melee character.

For normal gameplay.. 14.4k modem would probably do.
