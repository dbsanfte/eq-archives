I recall the discussion, but I'm also sure it was pointed out to be
anecdotal evidence, (i.e. "Gee, it sure *seemed* like I was getting more
xp that way") and nobody has posted any logs comparing shots of xp bars
after killing "x" number of mobs grouped with an uberlevel and "x"
number of the same mobs grouped with a like level person. Can't prove a
negative very well, and I'll doubtless be too lazy to go do the test
myself, but I find it unlikely in the extreme that this is the case.
Otherwise everyone and their brother would be powerleveling their level
40 alts with a level 60 rather than grouping. And VI would squash that
like a bug in no time flat.

Actually, I suspect that what's happening is as follows: People taking
their first character up the levels have to fight and scrap it out
fighting appropriately leveled mobs while grouped with like level range
players. They get used to a certain rate of xp gain. Then, later on,
they take a new character through those levels and PL them by grouping
them with a much higher level character and taking on mobs *way* past
what they'd be able to kill on their own, and getting 40% of each kill.
And thus, it certainly seems like they are getting more xp.
