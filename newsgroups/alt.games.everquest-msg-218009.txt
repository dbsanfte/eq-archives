Hi all,

The dwarven paladin that my friend and I started a while ago has a major 
problem. We upped the AGI to 79 (someone advised to get it above a 
minimum of 75). However, with tanking and taking the bulk of the damage 
through level 27 his defense stands at a pathetic 16. All of his other 
defensive skills seem to generally go up (dodge, parry) as they should. 
However, his defense refuses to budge. As the skill is unable to be 
trained (I believe) is there a way to get the skill up?

We have tried duelling- a guildies level 28 warrior bashing it with my 
cleric healing as required - tried this without a skill up for 45 
minutes yesterday before calling it quits on the duel.

Any advice would be appreciated greatly.

Thanks,

Matt
