Using a real third party macro program to do this sort of thing is 
apparantly possible, but no, I don't think you can do it strictly within 
the everquest game.

However, you -can- set up to eat on any given key press.

First, you need to put that food in an open inventory slot, slot 2 in 
your example.

Now drag slot 2 over to a hotkey, lets say for the sake of arguement, 
hotkey 2.

Now whenever you press the 2 button, you'll eat the food in slot 2.  If 
you replace the food with something else, pushing 2 will work as though 
clicking on that... if its a spyglass, say, you'll instantly activate 
the Telescope effect.

OK, now you are only halfway there.  Since constantly clicking 2 is only 
a little easier than clicking on the inventory slot, you aren't really 
automated yet.

Now go into options and find your keyboard settings.  Go to a key you 
hit a lot, say the left arrow.  Tell it to press the 2 button for you 
whenever you hit it.

Now, assuming you move around with the keyboard arrows rather than using 
mouselook, you'll be tapping 2, and thus eating food, every time you 
turn left... which is a lot more often than you probably think, since 
you constantly adjust heading a little left or right as you travel in 
most zones, and spin back and forth to see whats going on even when 
standing still in most places.

The benefit of doing this, by the way, for people who might be wondering 
why the OP would want to find a way to accomplish it, is that by force 
eating junk food in slot 2, you stay full, and therefore don't eat the 
food in slot one.  You can put some expensive or just annoying to get 
food in that slot that will improve your stats, and yet avoid eating it 
as long as you can remember to keep slot 2 full of food.

This is moderately inefficient, since force eating food only gives you 
half the normal duration of the food; but eating twice as many fish 
rolls (cost about 4 cp each to make) is a lot better than eating your 
Misty Picnic (cost about 10pp in bazaar)

Another good trick is to put just one picnic in slot one, and the rest 
down in slot 8, with lots of fish rolls in say slot 7.  Now if you 
forget to keep slot 2 full, you'll eventually eat the one picnic thats 
in slot one, but then will go back to eating fish rolls until they are 
all gone before you finally start nibbling on your backup picnics.

The stat foods don't have to be in general inventory slots, they can be 
in bags, only the one stack you are force eating (in this example, in 
slot 2) has to be.
