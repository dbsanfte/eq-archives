You are on the path of wisdom and doing exactly what you should be.  Don't
worry about breeze.  You'll get there eventually.

That whole line of spells is something I rarely use.  All it takes is one
resist to get the whole group on you...

It slows their attack speed, which is a Good Thing.

Just try to keep selecting until you get the one that hasn't been hit.  If
I can't tell, I just mez what I've got targeted, which will work 50% of the
time.  Another trick is to stun them, which usually manages to seperate
them.
