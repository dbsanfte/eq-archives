You have invis...with that, there are no faction issues.

There are only 2 places where an Iksar (or troll, or ogre) need worry
during his quest:

1) Talking to the barbarian and greater spirits in north freeport at the
beginning of the quest. For clarity's sake: THE BARBARIAN WILL NOT ATTACK
YOU. He is on the "truespirit" faction (as are *ALL* of the mobs you talk
to during the epic).

2) Passing through Qeynos on the way to Erud's crossing for the test of
patience.

Nowhere else is an Iksar in any greater danger than any other race.
