Are there any quests that can be completed in any zone?  You usually
need to do a turn-in to a particular NPC in a particular zone, but if
you could do a quest in the Arena, you could determine the ZEM there. 
Another way would be to attend an event where exp was earned for a
GM-MOB kill.

In any case, it is also possible that whoever originally created this
list started with a spreadsheet of all zone names and set the
"default" ZEM to 75.  Since he found no ZEM for the Arena, he just
left it at the default.
