IMOSHO :
If the changes make it take less effort (at all!) to get to level 60
then this will lessen the achievments of all characters already 60. It
will also lessen the future achievment of all chars yet to reach 60.
Thus cheapening the game.

This is my opinion. There is NO fact. You can not say no to this as I
know my own opinion. Feel free to have your own.

True, but then again I don't think that no CRs is a bad thing. I was
stretching :-(

If you can find a definition of Too Easy, that we can all agree on then
we can have a factual argument. If not then Opinion is all we can have.

I think that there is a difference between changes to a system that is
3-6 months old and has just been "tested" by 400000 users and changes to
a system that is 2.5 - 3 years old.
True the difference is arbitary, but it remains.
Comparing todays patch to bug fixes from the first months of live EQ is
apples and oranges, and I think that you know that.

True, and I would not take back the early changes, or these changes.
However do you agree that there is a line somewhere that VI should not
cross ?
If you do agree then that is the reason that people want to talk about
these changes and have some fear of the future of EQ. 
If you do not agree that there is no change that VI can do that will
make the game too easy then I give up.

Ben what would be your line ? Where would too easy kick in for you ? I
assume that you have an opinion.

Yes there is.
Look at the differnce between the average person that you meet in EQ
compaired to the average person that you meet in Quake. In my opinion
the people in Quake are more annoying and the reason that they are not
in EQ is cause it is too hard and takes too long and does not give them
instant gratification. (No I don't have any proof)

The curent changes move EQ (miniscutly) towards Easy, Short, Instant
Gratification.

Eaqually you can't prove that it won't, it works both ways Ben.

The last line there is a matter of opinion. In some peoples opinion they
have already gone too far.

True and for the most part I agree, But remember that this is all
opinion.

Undeserved IN YOUR OPINION.
It is not illogical to fear that VI may do something stupid.
They have done stupid things in the past.
Hell the simple fact that a software vendor is releasing a patch with
sweeping changes makes me afraid. I see nothing illogical about that.

You agree that the current changes make things easier (not too easy)
You agree that the creent changes seem to be a departure from The Vision
Why not agree that future changes will follow on from this one ?
That sounds logical doesn't it.

We have changed our vision here is the new mision statment.
3 patches later EQ *could* be too easy.

To fear this progression does not seem at all illogical to me.

I agree there is no reason to start burning effegies of EQ execs or
deleting chars or canceling accounts. 
Mad ranting is bad.

Proper in your opinion (and mine).
I think that Jazz has over reacted, but you inability to admit that he
has any point to make (he does) or any right to his opinion (he does)
while stating your opinion as fact (it's not) has not helped any.

HTH,
