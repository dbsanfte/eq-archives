Greater Wolf Form doesn't give Haste, to my knowledge, it gives only a movement
speed boost.  Haste doesn't let you run faster, it makes your melee attacks
happen more often (faster, in that specific way)

IF I'm wrong and GWF includes a Haste, the answer will still almost certainly be
that it stacks with your SBOC haste.  There are three types of haste (in the
melee attacks more often sense) in the game, "Item Haste", "Spell Haste" and
"Song Haste".  All three stack with each other, so you can have up to one of
each affecting you at any given time.  Item Haste + Spell Haste have a cap,
based on your level, the two will not exceed some certain limit, even if you
have say a 200% haste item and a 200% haste spell on you, if your limit based on
your level is 80% you still are only hasted at 80%.  Song Haste also adds to
either of the above two types, or to them added together, but moreover also
raises your cap per level, so if you have a 10% song haste in the above example,
you can then have a total haste of 90%.

Song Haste is a bit confusing, though, as it applies only to a very limited run
of songs that higher level bards get, their normal run of songs with a haste
component count as "spell haste", and do not stack with other types of spell
haste, nor do they raise the cap.

At any rate, the point of all this is that -if- GWF has a haste, its almost
certainly a "spell haste", and will stack with your SBOC which is definately
"Item Haste".  There are a couple items which cast "Song Haste", if GWF counts
as that, it will -still- stack with SBOC's Item Haste.

Greater Movement speeds never stack, you can have either SoW or SoE or Selo's or
Wolf Form or SoS or a Horse or a Drogmar or TBoots or JBoots or Run AA (or
probably some other run speed buffs I'm not thinking of), but will never run
faster than the fastest of those various movement speeds; in the case of the
mounts, you'll in fact run only at mount speed regardless of what other buff you
might have up (or AA you may have).  I don't think you can actually have a mount
and be in wolf form anyway.  But the only way SBOC will affect your running
speed is if it makes you more encumbered to wear it, and slows you down (or
boosts your strength and reduces your encumbered status to speed you up, but I
don't think SBOC has a STR boost)
