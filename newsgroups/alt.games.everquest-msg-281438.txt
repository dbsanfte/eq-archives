Between 1-8 hours maybe.

Noone I know plays either so I'll have to meet new people in the agme, but
isn't that part of what the game is about? :)

I want to explore, experience, craft, I want to live in the world, not rush
through it to become ythe most powerfull beeing (there will always be
someone better anyway).

I love RuneScape, that already has the quests etc, now I want the same, but
with better looks. So content is important and must be variating and
challenging, but looks and the wow factor is very important to..

Best Wishes
