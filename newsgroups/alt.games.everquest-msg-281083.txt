You seem to have entirely missed my point.  Perhaps I made it
ineffectively.  Or perhaps you are my straight man.  :)

I thought I had tipped my hand with my last comment. :)

By and large, I agree with you.  My highest character is level 60, and
I feel that I got almost nothing from GoD and precious little out of
PoP, Omens and DoN, so far.  It doesn't help that I haven't played my
level 60 in some time either, failing to realize what only that
character might have gained from those expansions.

My point was simply to observe the trend that the high-level content
invariably gets bundled with other features that low levels can use and
may come to find indispensable.  I think my main killed a dozen or so
mobs in Natimbi, mostly for giggles, but I haven't killed or looted
anything else anywhere in GoD.  On the other hand, as a tradeskiller, I
have found the Abysmal Sea zone to be incredibly convenient.  If I
could bundle Abysmal Sea, the corpse summoners and the PoK books into
one expansion and sell back the rest of the content in PoP, GoD and
DoN, my own game experience would not change a whit.  (Well, OK, I've
been on one DoN mission and one Hedge raid...)  Undoubtedly, others
have different experiences, but for me, the high level content was
largely wasted.  Nevertheless, just about every expansion has something
that I can use, somehow.  Does this mean that I will rush out and buy
the latest expansion?  It's getting harder and harder to say "yes" to
that question, as time goes on...

I think a better analogy would be that a $1,500 PC is more "geared for"
your soccer mom than the $500 PC, not because it has faster graphics
and a better sound system, but because it also comes bundled with a
utility for organizing the family photos that she takes.
