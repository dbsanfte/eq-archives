}What's good twink gear for a monk in the affordable range (200 - 700pp 
}per piece) optimized for effectiveness (i.e. not paying twice the pp for 
}a dex+7 instead of dex +6 ring etc ... maximum gain). He currently has a 
}CCS and Wu Trance Stick, but I need some sensible armour and jewellry. I 
}noticed Wu Armour concentrates on AGI only .. what should I opt for?

Despite only having agi, Wu's has pretty good AC.  For rings:  Velium Fire 
Wedding Rings - 6ac 65HP...  I sell them for 450pp on Ayonae Ro.  Orc Fang 
Earrings are good, or Cougar Claw, although they do weigh more than 0.1..  
Gem Inlaid Gauntlets are nice, but weigh a whole pound.  Foreman's Tunic 
is lovely... 10AC and 3 str, 0 weight.  I've heard good things about 
netted kelp, but that looks pricey and a bit heavier than wu's.

I'm also quite pleasd with my Drakkel Wolfhide Leggings, which have a 
lovely salmon pink graphic. :)
