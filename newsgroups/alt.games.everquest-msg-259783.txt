This came about as a result of a saturated economy and player 
appeasement.  For the first few years in EQ the usual way to get anything 
was to earn it, or buy it if you saw someone auctioning it in a zone.  
There were few enough items to make that fun and interesting, some things 
you quested and killed for, the others you ran through zones asking for, 
or looking for someone selling it.  And you really got excited when you 
finally got it, either way.

But over time, with items not decaying, and not destroyed for any reason, 
the stock(and money) built up until itemizing through most of the game is 
now just earning/twinking money, going to the bazaar and buy that hard-
to-get item, then pass it on later.  DAOC has gone the same way, with 
it's housing and market zone.  You can find almost anything you need 
there, no need to do quests or tradeskills or dangerous drops any more, 
just earn enough money the honest or gimmie way, walk over to one npc, 
find it, go buy it, get on to the next level.

Totally ruining the gameplay experience of proudly earning something 
yourself.  (aside from working for the money of course, though with so 
many high levels, you can get tons for free easily now)

Not sure of any solution, aside from having a game segmented into 
different parts, so that you have to move into a new section at a certain 
level, and can't interact monetarily or physically with the previous.  
Say at level 30 you have to take the boat to continent 'b' from continent 
'a', because on 'a' you can't give money or items to players any more, or 
kill things there under your level. Just talk and look around. This would 
somewhat slow down to a crawl super twinking and money passing.  And it 
would make multiple game experiences out of one, new lands, new 
experiences.  Details would be tricky I'm sure though.  But the whiners 
would cry that it was their money and they should be able to do with it 
what they want.......


Gee, I've ranted twice in two days. Just seems like all these games are 
reverting to easy peasy treadmills with no fun and excitement.

I need Sims 2 to hurry and come out so I can start that all girl 
neighborhood or something.
