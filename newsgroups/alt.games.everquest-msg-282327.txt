what new secret methods that weren't included with the last 5,000 or
so scams???  You've been asked this bazillion times but never answered
hmmm...

I've made over 10k per day without haing to raise a finger, all I need
is a buyer offering the best price on popular items like radiant
crystals or blue diamonds, then resell them at a markup for a profit
while cutting below other resellers.  Best of all this is legal and
won't get you banned at all.

Also there's the Hill Giants in Rathe, still good money if it's not
camped.  Plus if you melt those fine steel weapons to HQ ore, you get
almost double the plats reselling to npc than what you would get with
plain unmelted weapons.
