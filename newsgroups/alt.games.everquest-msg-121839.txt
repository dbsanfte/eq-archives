Hopefully verant and other makers will learn what not to send from the
client. Not sure if it does now, but showeq used to be able to change 
the way you see at night (because ultra or infra was sent from the
client too or something) Evidently spawn locations and location of
spawned items like everqreen leaves in gfay on the ground are still
sent, or at least loaded into the client? I think I heard that showEQ
can track those also.
