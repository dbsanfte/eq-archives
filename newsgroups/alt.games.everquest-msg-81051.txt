Only down side I see to this is that some players don't have SoL and, due to
the system requirements, May never get it.
The Bazaar, in it's current state (about 30 - 50 ppl in zone) is a bit rough
on the frame rate so what it'll be like with 80 odd traders I dread to
think.
Good points are that it is not a newbie hunting zone (or indeed any sort of
hunting zone) there is an Arena there for Duals and also a bank with 4
bankers...Although I dread the 5FPS I expect to get in there, can't wait for
the zone to be implemented fully.
EC was never a good choice to trade in, although I'll miss people bringing
Slate to the tunnel for a beating, perhaps they could make him a random
spawn, just for old times sake :ï¿½)
