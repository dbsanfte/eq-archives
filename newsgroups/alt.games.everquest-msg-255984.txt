Not all melee are tanks (rogues, rangers, monks).  Even when they are all 
tanks, only one of them should be actively tanking the mob, the others 
should be concentrating on doing damage, which means not attacking from 
the front arc.  By attacking from the sides and rear, any melee class 
will see about a 15% increase in DPS due to the lack of ripostes and 
blocks and such.
