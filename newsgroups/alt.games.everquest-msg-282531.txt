	I suppose it depends on what you mean be "better" :)
	
	Yes, in theory you can progress from "bazaar gear" (which of course 
everyone magically gets the best of without needing to camp difficult 
group-drops in raid gear to sell) through to some decent gear via the 
coupon-mission-coupon cycle Sony have been repeating ad-nauseum of late.

	But christ it would be mind-bendingly boring to actually progress this 
way. I found OoW to be wonderful, except that for the "teir 1" groupable 
quests, you need a raid to obtain either the legs or the chest piece. I 
loved the varied zones, the way we *could* kinda sorta catch up a bit on 
gear without raids, but it did fall short of the mark... the gear was 
nowhere near Elemental quality, which is what it needed to be to bring 
us into shouting range of raiders, and as I said, some pieces you needed 
a raid to get anyway.

	DoN is when I quit. (actually kinda faded out then and canned my 
account when the first descriptions of DoD came out...)

	Whatever you may say about what players *might* be able to do, with 
this kind of contenct, they *invariably* trap each other into doing the 
same mission over and over. Fourty hours of missions would be a cool way 
to upgrade your gear, but not fourty hours of the same one-hour of content.

	Yeah, you're going to tell me that raiding can be repetitive too, and I 
know, because I eventually did some of it... but I found even being a 
robot-soldier to be more interesting than grinding endless creators. Not 
to mention, far more rewarding in terms of time, quality of loot, etc. 
*three* pieces of time gear seemed to render creators totally trivial. I 
went from dying a fair bit on them to seemingly invincible. (9% 
shielding, I suspect, was a big culprit there, more so than the silly 
amounts of HP and AC I gained)

	I think these expansions could easily be a lot better, if Sony 
implemented a system whereby overdone missions lost value. Or, you know, 
came up with something less trite than "missions" and "points" or 
"crystals" or whatever cornflake-packet-tokens they're making you 
collect nowadays.

	To me, for single-groupers, the peaks were Veksar (not even an 
expansion) and OoW. Probably Veksar more so, because you could really 
gear yourself out there and at least be ahead of most groupers if you 
put the time and effort in, at the various camps, even if you never got 
close to even VT gear (by then many, many expansions old). LDoN was fun 
for about a week, then turned into a mindless grind of the same one or 
two mission types, a lesson they failed to learn for DoN or apparently 
even DoD.

	I'm in the market, and they sure aren't satisfying me. On the other 
hand, yes, level 45 mobs wouldn't either :)
