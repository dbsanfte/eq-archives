Personally, I'd make droppable items tributeable for buffs, and NO DROP 
items tributeable for straight XP. Don't ask me exactly what's the 
reasoning behind it, I just think it could work, if not for other reason 
that it would allow both sets of items to be balanced separately.

Not a bad idea at all.
