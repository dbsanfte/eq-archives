Not enough for XP even :)  I've only been on one machine with XP
running 128MB Ram.  For it to feel decent I had to disable a lot. 
They use a telnet program and wordpad so its not like the machine was
being tasked very heavily.  Under normal use I've seen XP not running
optimal until there was over 300MB Ram.  The 320MB I have on the
computer at work works fine.  The way I run my machine at home 512 is
sometimes not enough.  But I have Kaaza running in a VMWARE session (I
don't trust putting it on my PC) while running Quake3 :)
