You don't play much Quake, do you?  Or better yet, Half-Life?  Those levels
are WAY too huge and three-dimensional for a quick, handy 2D automap to be
possible.  EQ is a piece of cake by comparison.  Aside from the realism
issue, I think the reason you don't get automaps in those shooter games is
because of the exhaustive effort it would take to make the rotatable
wireframes you'd have to use.  There would have to be a separate "map view
mode" that filled the screen, otherwise you would get no detail.  Maps would
have to zoom and rotate freely so you could get a real sense of where you
are.  If all you get is 2D, your XY position probably won't help, since you
could be in any of corridors A, B, C, or D, which all have different Z
coords.
