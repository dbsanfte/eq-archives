I think that in addition to the soul binders, they should definately add in
soul porters, and maybe soul xp grinders.  No more need for this tedious xp
grind grouping, just go to a soul xp grinder, say I want XP, and voila,
another level gained, with appropriate skill increases, just as though you
had actually joined an xp grind group.  But wait, why stop there, what about
soul loot providers?  Want that hard to obtain no drop planar armor, look no
further...
