Now your just being an idiot. 

Many of the activities possible in everquest from the use of bad 
language, scamming other players, exploiting pathing bugs, macroing, 
harrassment, kill stealing, etc etc etc are all against the rules, and 
yet are *not* <gasp> enforced by the game code. So... ergo... the game 
code is irrelevant. Please try again.

Ebaying items is against the rules; whether the game code can or does 
enforce that rule is irrelevant.

So now we agree its against the rules then.

*Whoosh* that was my point that you didn't actually make one going over 
yours.

Oh... so now we agree you bought a sword then. And all that hand waving 
about how its not a sword but just *time* was simply silly thrashing. 
Good, glad we're on the same page.

Actually, they make you look stupid. Nice counter argument though... 
oops... wait... you forgot to make one.

But the former is against the rules, while the latter is within them. 
Can you see the difference? 

Sneaking $100 out of the monopoly bank has the same effect on the game 
as turning over chance card and being award a $100 by the game... so why 
is the former ok, but not the latter? Oh... right... those pesky rules 
again.

So what makes EQ different? Why do you figure its ok to cheat in EQ?

If your only answer is "Because you can get away with it." then you've 
failed utterly at being a human being.
