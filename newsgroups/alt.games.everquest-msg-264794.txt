What they should do is provide a way to "archive" characters.  Allow you to
have 4 "active" characters, and some large number of "archived" characters
(32 would be cheap).  When you archive a character, the server would take
all the character data, encrypt it with a random 128-bit AES key, and
download the encrypted data to your machine, retaining only the key and a
checksum on the server.

It would be your responsibility to keep the archive character files (e.g.,
if you lose them, those characters are gone forever).  If you want to
reactivate an archived character, you can upload it back to the server,
which checks the checksum, decrypts, and puts it into one of your 4 active
slots.
