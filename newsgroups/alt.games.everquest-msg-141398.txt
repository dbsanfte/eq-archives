I researched it ahead of time, so I did buy the Netgear router.  I have been
very happy with it.  I saw that some people were having lots of trouble with
the Linksys, while others had no trouble at all.  Noone was able to pin it
down on one specific problem, changing firmware revision helped some, but
not others.  With the Netgear, I saw far far fewer complaints, so, being the
same price anyway, I didn't see any reason to go with Linksys.
