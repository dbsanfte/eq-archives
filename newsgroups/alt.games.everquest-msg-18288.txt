I would suggest Cobalt Scar and kill wyverns.  Most are still blue at
53, but some are green.  They randomly drop armor quest gems and are
decent EXP.  The zone is usually empty except for people going through
to Siren's Grotto.  The one bad thing about the zone is that if you
die, there is rarely a cleric to be found.

You might also try Eastern Wastes.  There are tons of giants that are
blue and also the ulthork man'o wars are great EXP at 53.  

Good luck to you,

Keith
