His dex is about 75 without adjustments, 78 with adjustments right now. And
he's wearing 2 Jagged Bands. I'd rather not sacrifice Str for Dex, if possible.

I know what you mean. I have a player-made bow (I paid for the components and
found a fletcher nice enough to make the bow for me for free), and I hit maybe
once out of every five shots. I only use it sparingly, as a result.

My warrior is level 10; Velious is a no-no, since everything there is level 35
or higher.
