Did Castle Mistmoore with my 25 cleric. After a couple of long
sessions, he's now a 29 cleric. From the patch message I understood
that Castle Mistmoore is the level 20 - 30 Hot Spot and the xp I got
when I soloed a DB seem to bear hat out -- roughly maybe 3 pct xp from
one kill (although I may be mistaken, definitely 2 pct). A druid who
dinged 31 reported many of the mobs had greened out on her (of course,
we are only talking about mobs outside the castle).

I always grouped since the placement of mobs is nowhere like Paludal
Caverns where a group would have spots (hill in Camp 1 comes to mind)
where casters could med in relative safety even as mobs respawned. In
Mistmoore, excepting the ramp to zonein, you would sit and med
virtually among the respawing mobs though the respawn time would
nominally allow a reasonable amount of mana and health regen.

If you kill the mobs fast, they respawn in close succession which can
cause problems as they add to the fight or aggro on clerics and
casters standing away from the melee. In addition,
enthusiastic/impatient pullers can easily find Red (to me at least)
con mobs not far away (deep in the Graveyard and in the castle
entrance area) which combined with respawning DBs can cause groups to
wipe or flee.

It was fun despite the deaths and rezzes. I haven't seen xp like this
since Paludal Caverns.
