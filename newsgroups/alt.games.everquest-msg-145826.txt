I went to East Karina after today's first patch. I was lucky to have the
crag spiders almost to myself for a while. I got to melee 3 three at a time!

Except that crag spiders now poison my 34 druid each time I melee one. That
happened very rarely before the patch, even with poison resistance at the
default 20.

I cast poison endurance to bring res to 40; didn't help. Holy cake and
kaladim constitutional brought it to 50; still didn't help.

I think that, even though the chance of a green mob sticking a spell effect
on you is low, long melee gives them many chances to do it.

So, as announced in the patch message, the game balance is changed by the
new resistance system.

I can still farm silk, but it's a little more dangerous now.
