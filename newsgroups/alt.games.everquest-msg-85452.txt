I am new to everquest (two weeks) thanks to the PC Zone free trial and have
found myself addicted. I have just found out that Everquest and the Ruins of
Kunark are to released on budget soon at ï¿½9.99.
What I want to know is:- If I buy this, will the monthly charge go up or
stay the same. Please let me know if the situation would be the same for the
other expansions as I think Trilogy will be out in March sometime.
