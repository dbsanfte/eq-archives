Skyfire is great as a weapon under 45, then either ditch it or use it only
outdoors (and you're not the sole tank)
The proc on the Skyfire is AoE and will not only dam any mob in the area but
also you, 75 x 3 may not sound a lot but in my experience it procs 3 or 4
times in a normal fight at that level, more wasted mana on healing you.
Only time I can think this can be used effectively is a full group hunting
outside, the proc has a small warning time before the first wave hits so you
can get out of it's range and let the other tank hold the mob in place.

A better weapon for that sort of cash would be a crystallized spider fang
(only velium shards as a proc but at least you won't hurt yourself or break
mez) same dam/del as skyfire, either hand usable...looks like a tooth pick
tho. Were around 2k but have prolly dropped to close to 1k now.
