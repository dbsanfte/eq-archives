My cat once peed on a stereo amp I had sitting on the floor behind my
computer desk. I quickly turned it off, dealt with the cat, and then
proceeded to apply some industrial strength blower fans to the amp for about
three days in hopes of drying it out before trying to turn it back on again.
Do you have any idea what my house smelled like during that time?
