Hi all,

Have you noticed how the compass work since the new UI ?
You have to close the window if you want to see the pointing direction
updated, that make that nice tool really uncomfortable to use.

I hope theyy'll fix it soon, I've already filled a bug report, would be nice
if a lot of people were doing the same.

TIA,
