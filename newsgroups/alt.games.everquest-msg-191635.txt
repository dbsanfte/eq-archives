This guide was written due to my recent experience in Burningwoods. It
applies to bards but I'm sure it would also work for dr00ds or wizzies. Your
character will have to be high enough to be able to kite giants.

1 - head to Giant fort in burning woods
2 - grab the two sentries near the ramp and mop them up.
3 - Enter Enchanter (or group with enchanter as the case may be)
4 - Run up ramp and a giant in the fort
5 - Run underneath fort and let go a Chant of Frost on target
6 - do a few circles under fort to get a few giants agro'ed (not all, save
some for chanter or others)
7 - swarm kite first round of giants and repeat as required
8 - inevitably said enchanter will get mad watching you blow through
multiple giants in the time takes him to do 1 or a couple if in a group.
9 - enchanter tries to mez a few of your pulls to piss you off
10 - mez breaks and giant ancient waxes enchanter

This guide does work, all you need is an greedy envious enchanter.
