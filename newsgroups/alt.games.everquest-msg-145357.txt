Sure, but he wasn't talking about that - he was talking about damage
dealing. In the discussion of the term 'Warriors add some decent damage'
discussing tanking abilities has as much relevance as their swimming
skill or their faction in Rivervale.

And if they see that 'things are going wrong', what do they do again? Oh
yeah, hit their 'HEAL ME!' button, right? and if there are 2 warriors
left alive and they both hit that button, which do the clerics heal?

More to the point, if you've gone through 5 or 6 of your best warriors
(AE taunt, best taunting weapons, usually means your best tanks are the
ones to get agro first when it's needed, right?) how much hope do you
honestly hold out that your few remaining 'second string' warriors will
be able to save the day. Sure, once a week maybe, something will go
wrong as you describe. Out of those, maybe 1 every few months will be
saved by having a non-frontline warrior stepping up and saving the day.
And all this for the low low price, of 10ks worth of extra damage each
mob from a damage tailored class?

Warriors are NOT an adequatly scalable class. After you reach 'critical
mass', they're place on the raid is MUCH better served by putting a more
scalable damage orientated class in there. Since we first killed Emp, I
don't remember more than one where we went past the 3rd MT. Sunday night
I single tanked all 3 minibosses we fought in VT. Monday night we
cleared the entire rest of the zone, with only 4 tanking warriors the
whole night.

You were the one saying that any number of additional warriors were
beneficial since they could all call for agro if the fight went bad.
Please explain how they KNOW which of them should be shouting for agro
rather than them all being 'complete idiotic fuckwits' <sic> and calling
at once? If the warriors know who is calling for agro one at a time,
surely the clerics can know too? 

Warrior01 thinks, 'I'll hit my button now'
Warrior02 thinks, 'Warrior01 will be hitting his button, so I won't'

Why not:

Cleric01-07 thinks, 'Warrior01 will be hitting his button now, better
start healing him' 

I simply fail to see how having hoards of warriors with 'HEAL ME' keys
provides a benefit to a raid, when they can only realistically use them
one at a time, and if you communicate with the clerics in the slightest,
they'll know who's next going for agro, just as much as the other
warriors will /shrug


Oh, and for the record, THIS is what happens when the shit hits the fan:
Casters back off nuking
Rog/Mnk get in the mob's face with autoriposte at the ready.
Rangers chain agro with spells while having autorip ready
Next MT waits until heals start landing steadily, and only THEN goes for
agro.
