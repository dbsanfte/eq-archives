Yeah, I'll believe that when I actually see it completed.

10's, maybe 100's of mages/wizards/necromancers/enchanters
have spent a *SHITLOAD* of plat on these quests (not to
mention time) and had to conclude by trial and error that
they are broken.  Each patch where they say they've fixed
it, they've fixed small portions of it - but (obviously)
not the whole thing.

Why don't they make a character with an artificial research
skill maxed out, and provide him with all the items needed
to do the combines?  So they can actually test each part.

FEH!
