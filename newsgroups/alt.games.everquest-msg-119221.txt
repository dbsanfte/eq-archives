What he is saying is that despite what the scroll claims regarding race,
there are no race restrictions on it.  What those race restrictions mean is
that you as a half elf could not equip the spell, assuming that it's an
equippable item to begin with.  Memorizing the spell is not the same as
equipping it.  Opinion does not seem to be divided on this issue, except
perhaps in your mind.
