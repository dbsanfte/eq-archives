There seems to be this strange filter over our eyes, where we see only those
things that are relevant. There *are* harmless bunnies in the Karana, there
ARE regular sized rats and wasps and beetles, and there ARE wildflowers and
bumblebees and rainbows after the rains. It is just that, because they can't
harm us and do not interfere with our narrow objectives, we don't notice
them.

Same thing with  buildings and people in the cities. Certainly, a city as
huge as Freeport had many more people than the few score of merchants,
questfolk and guards. Where are the children? Where are the mothers hanging
out laundry? Where is the laundry itself? And where do these people live?
However, this filter is not perfect. We still see bats even when one hard
glare is enough to fry them, and there DO seem to be plenty of apparently
empty, unused buildings around. Ah, the things we miss....
