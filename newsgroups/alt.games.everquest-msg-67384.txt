Where did I say you had to solo everything?  I said you had to actually DO
everything.  Does it make sense to you that Verant could possibly think:

"Oh, it's ok...we're assuming that an enchanter who wants their epic to
delegate 20 people to get certain pieces for them...WHO on EARTH would
expect the enchanter to actually BE there when even one TENTH of the pieces
was acquired???  Pure foolishness!"
