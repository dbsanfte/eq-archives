What should happen is: In BB the shuttles move when the shout is heard
about the boat being ready and shortly after you zone into TD. 3
minutes shouldn't be a problem. The shuttles then wait around, without
moving for a while then head off into TD towards the Maidens Voyage.
At some point you should see a large ship, and the shuttles stop at
the bottom of a ramp next to the ship.

Now, I don't for a moment dispute what you say :) One thing you could
try if you're desperate is you jump off the shuttle in TD, and swim
towards the Elven Outpost (don't have a loc) - at the outpost is the
Island Shuttle, which goes between the outpost and the big boat. Try
that.

I've never been aggroed on in DL when invis AND levitating very high,
and there are enough high points after you exit the tunnel to do this.
I'm not saying you won't be aggroed, just that I never have been. Lev
+ SOW + Camo is mandatory :)

Good Luck,
Dave B.
