Interruptions occur either because you were hit by a mob, which is
easily verifiable and reasonable, or because the game engine thinks
you moved while casting.

The latter one presents a problem, because while *you* may be certain
that you didn't move, lag may mean the server thinks otherwise. I
think this has frustrated everyone who has played a caster at one time
or another.

About the only solution is to stop, count off a second or two to make
sure the server has had time to agree that you're stopped, then cast
the spell. Some people have said that stopping and then turning in
place a little will have the same effect, which may be true. Try that
as well.
