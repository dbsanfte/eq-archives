The cheapest horses (about 8.5K with CHA over 105) are only about 10%
faster than unbuffed running speed - definitely not worth it if you're
a SoW'ing class.

Horses do have other benefits/drawbacks beyond speed modifiers though:

+ You don't need to sit down to meditate
+ You don't need to worry about sit aggro
+ You get a degree of safe fall
+ You look cool :-)

- Manouevring, targetting & looting are awkward 
- Climbing steep slopes is virtually impossible
- You can't interrupt spell casting by ducking

Worth it?  Debatable.  If you have plenty of money it can't hurt.  If
you're short of cash, there are other things you're likely to need
first.
