Hey, People, I have a problem maybe someone can help with.  My sound in EQ
is not working correctly.  It seems that the sound balance between things
like opening my bags in inventory and clicking buttons works fine, but
sounds that you would normally hear when my group is fighting a mob ( i.e .
swings of swords and mob attack sounds and ambient dungeon noise ) is very
very low.  So low in fact that I must turn up my volume to almost full
blast, and then that is no good because the other sounds are then way to
loud.  Anyone have a fix for this.  I have tried all possible adjustments to
my hardware and sound options in EQ that I know of. I also have all my
latest drivers.  My systems specs are below.  Thanks for the help.

Ge Force 3 TI 500
