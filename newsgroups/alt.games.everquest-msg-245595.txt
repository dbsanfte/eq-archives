Short answer, because charm is overpowered.  (Not dire charm).

Between the druid and enchanter, you can have two charmed, hasted, snared
mobs.  Just one hasted charmed mob can outdamage an entire party...  As Mr.
Navarro put it, two at once isn't just obscene, it's bordering on
pornographic.

Having a druid adds snare (very important so the players survive charm
breaks)  evacs, and healing in case someone takes a hit.   Having an
enchanter adds mana regen, magic resist debuffs (so snare and charm stick
more) and crowd control if an add happens.



The reason everyone is making fun of the original poster is that he harped
on Dire Charm.   Dire charm has in its favor that it never breaks... but
it's limited to level 46 mobs.   They have to be specially placed in PoP
zones, since theres nothing there weak enough, and they do crap damage.
More like a non-charmed pet. (double 150's)  Charmed pets hit like normal...
triple 500's.
