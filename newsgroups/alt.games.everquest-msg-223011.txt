    Amusing little issue in Planes of Power that I imagine they're fixing
right now: they fudged up the regen rates on named mobs. Badly. As in, a
non-aggro named mob would LOSE 5% health per tick until it despawned. Most
nameds weren't up because, surprise surprise, they'd despawn soon after
popping. I'd love to see what got messed up to cause that problem.
