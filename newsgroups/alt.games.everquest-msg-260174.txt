The GPS is on average much more accurate, and takes far less skill to use.  
The GPS would also be much more helpful than the alternatives in 
'uncharted territory', where you wouldn't have a map by definition.

Except that inventing ways of finding your way around can be quite fun.  
So if we're -given- a perfect way to find our way around, we'll never have 
that pleasure.  I remember in old school EQ being quite pleased when I'd 
figure out that if I went to landmark A and turned in direction B 
(which might involve referring to say, the direction clouds moved, or 
the direction a dropped dagger pointed...) and ran a bit, I'd always 
manage to find landmark C.  Nowadays, landmark C is always on the map, so 
I just watch my arrow zip over there.  To me, that's not as much fun.  I'm 
deprived of an opportunity to feel clever.  *shrug*
