The bump for explorer knives is really good: +100 for warrior faction, +25
for all the other non-necro factions. About 1 in 4 explorers drops a knife,
and additionally each explorer gives you faction as well. If you were
starting from scratch, farming explorers until you had 6 stacks of knives
would make you non-kos to warriors. Turning in the 6 stacks of knives would
max out warrior faction and make you non-kos to the other factions. Or so
the numbers worked out at one time :)
