this one is a problem i have ran into with a office pc of my(games internet
cafe) I ran eq at home with no problems on G-force3 and i go to install eq
at work so i don't spend the whole day watching people play CS. I can't even
get pass the loading screen after i selected the server. The whole screen
goes black and the pc locks. That was with a Ali 266 ddr mobo with mx 400
64mb agp card. It can't be a agp power problem due to it running UT2003 and
all the other high end stuff with out a glitch. I think some EQ technical
issues are about as hard to solve as the quest inside the game.
