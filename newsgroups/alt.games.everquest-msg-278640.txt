Okay - except, as I keep pointing out, your whole impression
that they offer "different ways of doing the exact same thing" is
wrong.   That's NOT the way it works.

Yes, there IS a different "flavor" for the heals of the three
healer classes (cleric, shaman, druid) but they did NOT
balance the classes by simply using the same heals and just
making them different "flavors."   That's certainly not as
*obvious* at lower levels, but that's not unique to EQ2.

At any rate, *in EQ2*, the classes and subclasses all bring
different things to the table.  The only real difference is that
shaman didn't get overpowering slows and clerics didn't get
overpowering CHeal.   But a cleric still heals better than
the other priest classes, a druid still needs to keep in mind
they've got offensive firepower to make up for a lack of
raw healing ability, etc.

I can understand your point-of-view if you've only played
EQ2 up to around level 20-25.   The differences just aren't
as pronounced yet.   But one could make the same argument
in EQ for priests at that level as well.   Clerics don't come
into their own until level 39 in EQ IIRC, for instance.
