I see that many people have responded to this and pointed out that the
suspected motivation is to cause people to go LD. What I haven't seen
mentioned is an important additional fact that the Bazaar currentlly only
supports 550 vendors at once (I believe that's the number, it might be
different, but there is a limit). I discovered this the other night when I
went to set up my vendor and got an error message telling me that the limit
had been exceeded and that I should check back later (Right. At 2am I'm
going to wait around and check later). I realized right then and there why
these people have been trying to get me to go linkdead. Some of them may be
pure griefers, but some of them are trying to weasel you out of your vendor
position for their own benefit.
