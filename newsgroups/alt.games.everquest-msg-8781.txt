The Crippling blow comes when you have taken so much damage you have gone
bezerk. It is more damaging than the normal crit.

You get a bonus for your level, not sure how it is calculated, at 40th level
I get +5 dam bonus to the Yak in my primary hand and 0 to the off hand. I
also get +8 to the damage on my Mith 2hnder. I know that the higher delay
the weapon the more of a bonus you get I think that is in groups of 5, after
40, so 40, 45 and 50 all have a different bonus to damage (there is a table
showing the calculations for this)
