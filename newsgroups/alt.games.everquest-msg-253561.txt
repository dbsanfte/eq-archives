Elemental Form AAs

View the Forums for extra details 
<http://forum.magecompendium.com/viewtopic.php?t=3731>

Common to all Forms

      Duration: 36 minutes, recast time 15 minutes*
      *All four forms share the same 15 minute timer

      Zoning removes the elemental form; it has to be recast.
(Comment: These two factors combine to an annoyance; if you get up a 
given form, then have to zone soon after, you can't get any form up for 
up to 15 minutes.  Zoning should, IMO, not be such a big factor in game 
play in EQ, as it tends very strongly to discriminate against certain 
classes and not against others.  At least rumor has it they are stopping 
the incredibly annoying "pet dies when you zone or LD" Feature.  This 
form thing should be in the same bucket, or it should have a much 
shorter reuse timer.)

      Zones that prohibit levitation (such as Temple of Veeshan) prevent
      Air form from working.

(Comment: Annoying, since the principle reason you'd want the form is 
for the added resists; mages get lowered resists in zones where levitate 
doesn't work, does that make sense?)

      Your faction does not modify when under elemental illusion

(Comment: Brell no, we wouldn't want that.  Think of the sheer raw power 
mages would have, in those few zones where elementals aren't KOS!  I'm 
not too steamed about this though as most other faction modifier 
illusions were nerfed long ago)

      You cannot ride a horse while in elemental form.

(Comment: well that sucks, in that I spend quite a lot of my time 
outdoors BECAUSE of the mount.  Major mage problem, IMO, is lack of 
aggro control, and a mount means my mana regen stays adequate while I 
never sit, and more, I can swap spells (which I do more than I'd like) 
without aggro.  Have to give up all elemental forms for it, or 
contrawise give up a near constant 20+ mana per tic regen rate for an 
elemental form.  In particular I'm thinking even Water form III would be 
a pittance compared to what I'd be giving up.  Indoors only line of AA, 
almost)

      There are no stacking issues with Elemental forms. Everything
      stacks with elemental forms except other illusions.

(Comment: OK, I bet this is a lie.  Even in a group I usually have more 
than 15 buff slots full these days.  Unless elemental form, unlike other 
illusions, doesn't eat a buff slot, there -is- a conflict of sorts, in 
that I'm going to have to click something off to make room for it.  When 
you consider how many mobs I fight will Tash or Malo me, then DOT me, 
and then listen to my cleric complain that I don't have room for her 
HOT, I really only have room for 12 buff icons.  What I really need is a 
complete list of every high level buff from every class, so I can be 
sure I'm clicking off useless [to me] attack buffs and the like, rather 
than HP or Stamina buffs or that sort of thing.  Anyway, one more self 
buff means one more cast buff I have to get rid of to make room)

Water Elemental Form

Rank 1: (3 points)
Illusion: Elemental
2: Water Breathing(1)
11: Decrease Stamina Loss by 5
12: Increase Mana by 1 per tick

Rank 2: (6 points)
Illusion: Elemental
2: Water Breathing(1)
11: Decrease Stamina Loss by 5
12: Increase Mana by 2 per tick

Rank 3: (9 points)
Illusion: Elemental
2: Water Breathing(1)
11: Decrease Stamina Loss by 5
12: Increase Mana by 4 per tick

*Note: Water Elemental Form does NOT add to the Flowing Thought limit.

(comment: OK, at the moment I'm at FT1, so this isn't an issue.  I know 
though, that high progression casters are running around at FT15 in gear 
alone, not counting the Mental Clarity they may have picked up along the 
way.  Spending 9 points to cap out my elemental form FT, only to see it 
become a waste of time later, seems really annoying.

More comment: Decrease Stamina Loss?  There IS no stamina loss anymore. 
  Whats up with that?.

More comment: Water Breathing.  Yawn.  So easy to quest WB pieces and 
wear when needed, and its needed so rarely?)

Air Elemental Form

Rank 1: (3 points)
Illusion: Elemental
3: Levitate(1)
11: See Invisible(1)
12: Increase All Resists by 10

Rank 2: (6 points)
Illusion: Elemental
3: Levitate(1)
11: See Invisible(1)
12: Increase All Resists by 15

Rank 3: (9 points)
Illusion: Elemental
3: Levitate(1)
11: See Invisible(1)
12: Increase All Resists by 25

*Note: Zones with Levitate disabled prevent this form from taking hold.

(Comment: Levitate is nice I suppose, since sometimes I keep levitate up 
in irritating zones, or just to make travel a bit safer and smoother. 
Preventing the form taking hold, though, instead of simply preventing 
levitate portion working, seems like sloppy coding to me.

More comment: See invisible?  Come on, Orb of Exploration.  What else am 
I going to put in my ammo slot?  And OoE is Plainsight, which is a 
damsite [note, place to build a dam] better than petty See Invis

More Comment: Increase Resists by a pittance?  Isn't it relatively easy 
to buy bazaar gear to cap out any given resist if needed?  Particularly 
on FV where LDoN resist augments are droppable?  Resists are rarely an 
issue anyway in my experience, other than on raids, where there's 
usually a lot of help available in maxing out a resist with buffs.

Fire Elemental Form

Rank 1: (3 points)
Illusion: Elemental
2: Increase Damage Shield by 10
11: Increase INT by 10
12: Increase Effective Casting Level by 1

Rank 2: (6 points)
Illusion: Elemental
2: Increase Damage Shield by 20
11: Increase INT by 15
12: Increase Effective Casting Level by 3

Rank 3: (9 points)
Illusion: Elemental
2: Increase Damage Shield by 30
11: Increase INT by 20
12: Increase Effective Casting Level by 5

*Note: If you are level 65, Effective Casting Level has no effect.

(Comments: The increase effective casting level thing sounds really 
nice.  Except that I'm 65 now, so its useless.  And if they raise the 
level cap to 70 and raise this cap with it, then it will only be useful 
for 5 levels at best [and only the lowest form will be useful that long] 
  Funny thing is, I think without the cap this would be an easy answer 
to one of the big mage complaints: that wizards and necromancers get 
nukes that have negative modifiers to resist built in and mages don't. 
A level 65 mage casting as a 70 mage should be a good bit better with 
resists.

More Comment: Increase Int.  Hmm.  I'm always capped with KEI, and am 
working on being capped without KEI.  I do need to raise my caps, I 
suppose with enough points dropped into doing that this would be helpful.

More Comment: Damage Shield.  On me.  You do know I stopped getting hit 
on purpose roughly 45 levels ago?  I guess I could get a nice long 
duration regen and farm greenies with this, noting though that I still 
have to do one point per mob so they don't poof on me.  Mobs that don't 
run, and spamming my cheapest PBAE maybe?  Sounds about as useful as a 
druid's pet.)

Earth Elemental Form

Rank 1: (3 points)
Illusion: Elemental
10: Increase STA by 10
11: Increase Max Hitpoints by 50
12: Increase HP when cast by 50

Rank 2 (6 points)
Illusion: Elemental
10: Increase STA by 15
11: Increase Max Hitpoints by 100
12: Increase HP when cast by 100

Rank 3 (9 points)
Illusion: Elemental
10: Increase STA by 20
11: Increase Max Hitpoints by 200
12: Increase HP when cast by 200

(Comment: Cute, a little HP buffage.  I'd be much happier with it if it 
increased HP by a percentage, rather than a paltry few points.  Does 
raising stamina still add hp?  If so, does the added HP from raising 
stamina stack with that from the 11 and 12 slots?_
