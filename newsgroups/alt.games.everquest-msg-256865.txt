Our range is 1 to 6 per raid mob, based on similar factors.  We just 
tweaked our system some because points were going up faster than they

items, they are all fixed cost based on the mob difficulty, and quality 
of the loot.

If you have someone who is fair dealing with it, it can work, but, as 
with most loot systems, it will lead to complaints at some time or other.
