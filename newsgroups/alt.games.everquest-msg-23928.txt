Hiyas

I need to raise my faction with the guards in East and West Freeport that I
stupidly lost from agreeing to help a friend kills guards in WC. I did this
on my Ranger just before I stopped playing EQ about 14 months ago, and now I
am addicted to EQ again and have been playing my Ranger a bit, and being KOS
in Freeport is a pain. So any suggestions on how I can go about impressing
these guys? A friend said its near impossible without effecting faction with
gaurds in North Freeport, is he right? Any help / advice is appreciated.


Thanks


Ben
