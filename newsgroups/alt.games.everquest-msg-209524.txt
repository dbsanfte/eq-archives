Hmm, that wasn't what I saw.  Fixation of Ro (ATK and FR debuff) had
the same effect as you report for a pair of poison DoTs, namely that
even when I managed to dump agro onto the MT I could not sit without
the mob coming after me.  That's a lot more agro than I get from a
Snare. In fact it's more agro than 2 Snare resists and a Snare that
sticks.  Meanwhile, snare would turn a mob away from the Shaman if
her slow stuck, but if the mob resisted slow I had to do more.  On
top of that our Cleric was only L40, she was melting like butter in
a microwave the one time a mob started pounding her, and our MT was
needing too much healing when the mobs were unslowed, so the only
tactic that worked was for me to keep the mobs rooted at all times.
Also worth noting is that these were undead mobs, and I've seen in
other situations that not all mobs follow the same agro rules, and
undead seem to be different from most other mobs.
