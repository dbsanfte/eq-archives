We have a local park in my town with a large colony of feral cats.
It's a "convenient" dumping ground for unwanted kittens. 

There is a local group of volunteers that capture, spay/neuter, and
then return the feral adults back to the colony. The kittens are taken
into "foster" homes where they are socialized with people and nursed
back to health. The kittens are then adopted out to people that sign a
contract with 2 conditions....

1. The cat must be kept indoors. 
2. The cat must be spayed/neutered. (You get a vouched for the service
at a local vet)

They deliver the newly adopted kitten to your home in person, and if
they do not approve of the conditions you don't get the animal. 

This same group of volunteers distributes food out at the park on a
regular basis to make sure that the feral cats that can never be
places in a home do not starve.

Spaying/Neutering is a responsible act. Dumping unwanted
kittens/puppies in a park or the local SPCA is "convenient". 

Clear enough for you?
