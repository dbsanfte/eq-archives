    Root - indoors, at 49, you have better than ghetto mez or you usually
end up going at a snail's pace. Can be used for aggro control as well, but
since mana wise I'm usually the weakest link I let someone else do that.
Many of the situationals also looked iffy - Invoke Fear, Retribution, Atone
(never really works when you wanted it to, slow refill means no chain-casts
when needed), Flash (the idea of a blinded mob running away scares me more
than me getting beat on).

>Yes, Superior if tank heavy, Great for robe based groups.

>kill?

    The Force/Retribution/Strike slot. You aren't pulling, you likely aren't
in a three stun mode, and using your mana for damage seems silly when you
look at the damage output of the people you could support with it instead
(unless special situation, like MUST DIE NOW!!!!) When I go to three stuns I
drop Celestial Healing - if I'm chain stunning and have to stop that to
heal, it must be some sort of "heal now plARGHHH!" situation. No time for
Cel Heal to work its magic. When I load in a nuke I usually drop either
Complete Heal or Divine Light (using Cel Heal as a Divine Light substitute).

>I use all the spells on that list regularly, and feel a little selfish
taking
>-one- slot for self preservation.

    Don't. If you die, they're all doomed anyways. If you live, you can get
the group back up and running in place OR buff the survivors up enough that
an assault back to the corpses is possible.

>Kill the root slot?  What if I need to park adds?

    Then things are going badly. ;-) Whenever I want to park an add until
it's mezzed, I me-park it. Drop a big heal on someone, then start
alternating stuns on the mob (while RIGHT in the face of the mob) with heals
to myself as needed. Usually doesn't take too long, I gain in reaction time
and slot versatility what I may lose in mana effiency, and Root doesn't cut
it against anything level 50 and up that's taken damage, or against casters.

    I wonder what I did before it. ;-) But I DO kill it when chain-stunning,
reason as given above.

    Fear kiting has a few inefficiencies built in, but not many. Casters
can't sit in one spot and med, usually - they have to slowly follow the
target, or hop-med. You also tend to require a "clean path" to kite along -
adds can get messy, especially if they start spreading out over a fair area.
But it is sweet. I remember the first time my first guild (all dwarf) went
to kill Sand Giants in SRo. The other cleric wondered why we had to use
fear. So I stopped casting it for a bit and let him find out. ;-)

>Wave of Fear.  Good if attacked by a cluster, or no?

    Rarely should you find yourself under attack from a cluster of mobs you
didn't see coming outdoors, that were all in one place and are high enough
to be a threat, that can't be outpaced, that will allow you to channel Wave
of Fear through the beats and which will ALL not resist the spell. I've used
it twice maybe, to see how big a train I could make indoors when nobody was
around.

    I hear that our poor dwarven CHA may partially be to blame for our roots
breaking fast, but as yet I haven't seen any hard evidence.

    If I want a lot of healing on everyone, I refresh Heroic Bonds. Gives
about the same healing as Word of Vigor, less aggro, and helps me space out
buffs. Hey, I have to refresh it at some point anyways. ;-)

    Iffy. Odds are, the DD component would break the root and it would end
up closer. :-/

    I usually Stun, then Holy Might a runner. Faster reaction time, and if
the party STILL isn't on the runner then we have bigger issues than one mob
getting away. Fast reaction time is crucial - not only for stopping adds,
but if it gets around a corner on you and you lose line of sight you're
doomed.
