Warrior are fighting machines right. Now I like a few of the discs metioned
but would't you rather have a new abilities like Charge or Berserk/Frenzy.
Charge is a stun like attack, kinda what Jlmc mentions with his Shoulder
Block but without the self stun effect. Berserk/Frenzy is a short burst of
anger towards a mob. Like 6 or 7 swings (that land land ofcourse) at
once..usable each 10 mins whatever.

Don't get me wrong I dont have a high end warrior but I am just letting my
mind wander...and hoping it comes up with something.
