I didn't say I can't play without the 9th slot. ;) But I know I
sometimes had a hard time deciding what songs I should load. This
decision has become a lot easier once I got over 60. Those planar songs
are often bundles. I mean for instance Psalm of Veeshan. It just gives
you a DS and resistances against every element. Until 63 the best
a bard can manage is protecting against three types of elements. Same
goes for overhaste and spell boost.
So a 9th slot would enable me to load up on songs that usually would not
make it into my lineup. Just because there is no room for 'special
occasion' songs. :D
Having such a song available then makes me more capable in....hm terms
of flexibility!?

Just speaking from a bard&enchanter perspective I don't find mounts very
appealing. For me it's way to clumsy. So I can't argue here.

A tanking enchanter? You mean when you play mana sponge, right? :)
At least the clerics in my group weren't to pleased to have me
demonstrating my aggro holding tricks.

It has been quite a while since I last checked them. But for bards it
looked much like the planar songs. Just spiced up quite a bit but
nothing special.
