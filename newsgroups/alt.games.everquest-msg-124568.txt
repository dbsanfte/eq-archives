Holy crap...A night of firsts for Tzen.  I grouped in Velks with THREE
epic'ed characters - ranger (L58), warrior(L60) and Bard(L60).  Never
did that before.  There was me as well (52 Ranger) and a druid(51). 
To be honest, the dru and I were mooching xp as the three epic'ed boys
were thrashing the mobs (spiders and statues...the rest was camped
(suprise suprise!)).  We were all at full health and mana 99% of the
time.  I never got aggro, unless jumped by a pop, and even then I
didnt have it long :)

I also had never grouped with an epic'ed ranger before, so I got to
see the earthcall proc etc, and his damage output with swiftwind haste
was incredible.

It has re-affirmed my desire to get my epics - I have many battles
ahead but it sure seems to be worth it!

Tzen,
52 Pathfinder, Seventh Hammer.
