The abandoned orc shovel is a cult item at the rangers glade.

It used to be that the only weapons a Ranger would ever use were 1hs. Nowadays,
there are good weapons of all types - 1hs, piercer, 2hs, 1hb, 2hb and even
2hp, so its worth skilling up on them if you're bored. Otherwise, just raise
them when you get a toy that needs them.
