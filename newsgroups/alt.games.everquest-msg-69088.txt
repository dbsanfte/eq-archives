I'm glad they did something like this.  They SHOULD have made the
Nexus an old world, free zone add on, and let everyone use it.
Actually wizard spires should have all connected from the get go via
firepots, mirrors, hard to get keys or something. Ridiculous having
only 2 classes able to gate another person.

If anyone thinks its gonna cut into "taxi" type players, it won't in
the slightest, and will actually boost the business, becasuse when
someone lands in Gfay, how they gonna get to WC or South Ro?  Us
gaters :)   

The boost in traffic to Odus will be great, Stonebrunt is such a
awesome zone for low to mid 30's. And around Warrens zone is great for
20 to 30.  Doesn't take long at all to get amiable in Paineel, kill
the King a few times, and you in. And once amiable you are free to
walk around city, "Heretic" is the only faction in entire zone!!

I'm saddened that my mage outgrew Stonebrunt before the new traffic
arrives, woulda been great to not be only one in zone most of the time
:(  Went from 20 to 39 there tho. Can easily make hundred plat an hour
in heavy weapons. all praise diminsional pockets :)
