Ok, my necro is 20... I've heard the information about forget Delay of
the weapon and just look at the damage because the PET will "always"
swing at the same delay (I think someone said 30).
So, If I have a 2hand sword, or a Scythe... when should/shouldn't I
give my pet a weapon?

Thanks again for your time.
