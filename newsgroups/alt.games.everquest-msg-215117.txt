Staying out of court is the best move Sony has made, all well and good
to claim such and such in a EULA but when faced with a jury those hard
facts begin to melt somewhat as there is no telling what a jury will
do...ever.  They know a jury is bound by very little and can in fact
rewrite law if in an offhand manner. Personaly I would love to see it
resolved.
