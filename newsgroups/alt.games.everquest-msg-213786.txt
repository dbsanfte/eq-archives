Granted you aren't gonna solo as fast as a melee with a fungi and
haste but a low lvl shaman will appropriate gear will solo about as
fast as anyone with the right tactics. He looses out on the DPS but
gains it back through lack of downtime. Decent DPS, sow at 9th lvl and
the most mana efficient downtime heal at low lvls (Inner Fire) makes
for a decent combo.

Ever watched a 65 necro solo? He outperfoms my shaman so badly it
isn't even funny. Imo, PoP pretty much put an end to efficient shaman
soloing, with mobs that hit for 500+ and slow mitigation your options
are too limited. Combine that with the fact that there's no
Lull/Harmony/FD to pull singles and I'd rate a 65 shaman as middle of
the road on the solo scale; pretty far behind Necros, Druids, Bards,
Enchanters and Wizard and comparable to Beastlords, SKs and Paladins
and maybe rangers. Granted, I can solo a summoning, slowable mob that
hits for 500 and I doubt anyone else can but it doesn't make for
efficient soloing, those kills are about bragging rights <g>. Either
high end shaman soloing is a myth or I'm missing something. 

... not that I'm complaining, I don't solo all that well any more but
that's more than made up for by the fact that nobody is better at
picking one of any other class and creating a viable group. 

It's probably also worth noting that, as much as I detest the time
limits in LDoN, from everything I've read about the expansion a 65
shaman will probably be the most wanted class even if single target
slow is irrelevant.  A cheap AoE slow to take the edge off of a big
pull combined with Quiessence and Cann5 is gonna be a godly combo.
