Well I live in Southern California where Edwards/Regal theaters are.
"The Twenty" started about two years ago. "The Twenty" at the Van
Helsing showing was about the final Friends and Fraser episodes, some
SC Fri channel movie with Coke, mars candy, Levi, cell phone service
providers, ect ads through out it. Usually just before "The Twenty" is
wrapping up; a computer or console game or two commercial will play.
"The Twenty" always follows this formula, promoting major TV series,
promoting made for cable movie or series, possible pop star promotion.
Commercial in between all that (damn where is my theater remote).
Ending with a computer game ad or two.

I'm not sure if this "Twenty" thing is just a So Cal experience or if
it is accross the country as I have only ever been to movies in So Cal
in the last 20 years.
