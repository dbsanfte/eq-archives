*shrugs* My guild constantly harrasses our rangers. Is it because we think
they're bad players? No, it's because they have done some things that make
for very amusing stories. Also, they initiate a lot of it themselves; you're
taking it too seriously, most of the anti-ranger jokes are meant in good
humour rather than as an insult.
