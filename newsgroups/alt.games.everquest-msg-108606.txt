Hey I just left Diablo 2 due to the crap that was there and decided to join
a better rpg game :)
but im a little confused on how the game is setup due to quest/skills and
what not:(
I have a barbarian/shaman  and im lvl 3 right now
only played 2 times so
how do you travel to other areas and how do you get your millions of copper
pieces into 1 platinum piece :)
I'm on the Cazic-thule server if anyone out there can help me out:)
well thx for your time on anyone that reads this
Tek
