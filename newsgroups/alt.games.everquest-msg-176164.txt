There are two questions to ask yourself:

Does your guild frequently wipe with the mob being low HP (e.g. Gore
at 20%, IV at 2%)?
Are you still standing when the big wipe starts and do you have mana
left? AKA you cannot nuke hard enough during fights to use all your
mana without aggro.

If you answer yes on both questions, get manaburn.  Your ability for
one big hit at the end might turn the tide in big mob fights.
If your guild usually wipes early or finishes the fights you don't
need it. If you have a great MA that can genrate enough aggro for you
to use your more mana efficient nukes, you don't need it either.
