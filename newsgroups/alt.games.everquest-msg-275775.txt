I'm dividing my time on EQ2 fairly unevenly between two characters.  What 
I'd like to do is log and monitor their progress using a log parser much 
like I used to do on EQ1.  But I'm having a problem with the way the log 
files work.

It seems when I first start EQ2 each session, it automatically starts 
logging to eq2log.txt (or similar) in the 'logs' subdirectory, and it seems 
that both characters' info is getting appended to this file.  If I /log to 
switch the recording off, and then /log again to switch it back on, it 
starts logging to the correct file, which is the one stored under the 
character's own name in the appropriate server subdir (in my case Neriak).

It's only a minor pain in the butt, but I wondered if anyone had any idea 
how to correct this and make sure the game begins logging to the correct 
file at startup?

It's my opinion, is all.
No, I'm not qualified.  No, I don't know everything.
No, I probably haven't got all the facts.
And yes, you probably *are* better than me.
Believe me, I can live with it.
