Used to be a troll vendor in Innothule, not sure what has been done to 
replace him for evil types.  He had all the poison line equivalent to the 
vendor in Everfrost.  The troll vendor was actually usable by barbarians 
as well, so, perhaps the barbarian one is usable by evil types, don't 
know.

I don't have Infusion of Spirit, so no clue on availability, it came 
about long after I surpassed that level.  Hmm, doesn't stack with Harness 
line...

At lower levels, I agree, I rarely used the debuff, did not get enough 
resists to make it worth while.  On raid level encounters, it is nice to 
get your best debuff out, as that can really help spells to stick.  While 
soloing, at the high 50s and on up, I used my best debuff a lot, and 
still do.  Malosini gets a lot of use, will untill I get a copy of 
Malosinia.  I tend to use Malo more though, just because it is 
unresistable, and seems to be enough of a debuff for my soloing purposes.

I use Plague only in extremely rare cases now, I stack epic dot with Bane 
of Nife.

I did not realize that clerics don't get this one, never checked.  For 
most of the applications I have run into, 18 counters of removal is 
sufficient in one cast, which is great for AoE slows, Blood of Nadox is 
awesome for that.  Mobs in CT and in PoS that I have encountered have not 
required more than one cast of BoN to remove the slow/dot.

Lucy says it does not stack with the harness line.  Lucy says it does 
stack with the stamina line of spells, so, IoS+Stamina+Tuna = more hp 
than HoS+Stamina, in exchange for an extra buff slot.  IoS has less str, 
but more dex than HoS.  Three buff combo gets you 50 str, 55 dex, 82 sta, 
250 hp.  Two buff combo gets you 67 str, 50 dex, 37 sta, 250 hp.  Seems 
like if the buff slots are available, until you get to having focus, the 
three buff combo would be better overall.
