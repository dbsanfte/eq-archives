Really?  Which class is it that has self-only ports to all the
newbie zones at level 1?  Oh yeah, not a single one of them...
until PoP released and they all got it, even the Druids.

Yeah, no doubt it was just peachy keen when casters (only) got a
collection of free ports by binding at the firepot room in TD.

LOL.

I'm a lot more interested in the possibility that you and Ingot
might be shocked into stepping back to give some dispassionate
thought to this than I am in debating.

My taunting is <not> pointless.  The world was a lot less about
touchy-feely build-up-self-esteem when I grew up, and getting
your nose rubbed in it when you said or did something stupid was
how you were made to realize that it was stupid.  Getting all
defensive essentially involves closing your mind.  It seems to me
that while my abrasiveness may not exactly be dripping in virtue,
defensiveness is utterly lacking in it.

Really?  I sure would, and I've enjoyed the hell out of my recently
acquired ability to rez people, on those rare occasions that anybody
actually wanted a rez less than the 90% they'd get by logging their
Druid on and fetching a Cleric from somewhere.  Even so, I've had to
rez myself a fair number of times, and frankly I'd much prefer a 90%
or better instead.  Please, bring on the rezzer NPCs.

That is the first even vaguely legitimate beef I've heard about this
yet.  I even understand it perfectly, my FV char is a 25 Druid, and
I chose Druid in part because I figured that would give me something
to offer a guild even though I only play occasionally on FV.  But
it applies to so few players, that while I can sympathize with you
on that narrow issue, I still see no justification for Ingot's whining
and calls for compensation.  The more so as it doesn't apply in
Ingot's case.

Why?  You still need a Druid or Wizard to get you to those far-away
high-end zones (no PoK ports there).  You still need a Druid or
Wizard in your group if you require evac capability.

Sorry, I'm of the same opinion as David on this.  The class defining
ability of Druids is their versatility.  Having ports nearly as good
as Wizards (Wizards still have a monopoly on Hate and Sky I believe)
is part of that versatility.  While your value to a guild may have
declined somewhat, that's pretty specific to FV server.  For a high-
end guild on a regular server that needs to be able to mobilize at
the drop of a hat a Druid or Wizard in every group is still gonna be
a helluva good idea:  no muss, no fuss, no running around and zoning
multiple times and regrouping, just mem/cast/HailMightyRaidLeader.
And for those that don't require a breakneck race to FCFS a target
but still want to move quickly I'd be shocked if they didn't have
bot accounts used for exactly that purpose.  A grouping Druid has
lost nothing except the need to go anon to avoid tells for ports
when his group is hunting in a popular zone.  A solo Druid likewise
has lost nothing.  Other classes have gained mobility, which makes
your extreme mobility less special, but I don't see that as the
end of the world.  And you've gained substantially in power with
the recent DoT changes, not incidentally becoming "stackable" in
groups as a result.

Quit bitching.  Druids now are more powerful than ever.  And it's
totally indefensible, IMO, for you to be whining that other classes
were made less gimped subsequent to the Druid upgrades.  If you
want to talk about "compensation" then try this:  you were
compensated BEFORE the PoK release.  Did you hear a huge wail go
up from everybody else over your power increase from the DoT
changes?  Hell no!  We applauded!  And now you have the gall to
come whining about the PoK ports?!?!?!
