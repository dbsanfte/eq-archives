Lavastorm is VERY dangerous.  If you go there remember the following 3
experiences I've had, and try not to test them out for yourself.

1)    If someone gives you SoW, try to get a levitate too, or be VERY
careful...running through Lavastorm with SoW, but not lev, is VERY dangerous
(due to all of the high hills with steep inclines on each side).

2)    And don't be like my Ogre Warrior and decide to go AFK in a lava pool
(with only natural fire resist).

3)    Or like my Barbarian Warrior and decide that LV17 and drunk is a good
time to explore Sol A (or Sol B, which ever one has the lava pits right at
the beginning of it)...corpse recovery from a lava pit isn't fun, though the
lava is a VERY quick way to sober yourself up again (from so drunk I
couldn't drink any more).
