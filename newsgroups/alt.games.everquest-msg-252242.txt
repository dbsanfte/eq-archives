What did you expect? People to delevel. Of course theres more people at 
the highend then ever before. Sooner or later everbody who keeps at it 
gets there. Particularly as SOE dumbs it down to accelerate the 
leveling. It used to take a year to reach 50 if you played semi 
casually... now it only takes several weeks, even untwinked, even at 
only 8 hours a week.

For some things yes, for some things no.

Better transport was needed as the game grew.
Soulbinders were needed, especially as the newbie areas started to thin 
out.
LDoN AP bought equipment was a good idea.
Instanced content is a good idea.

But on the other hand.
LDoNs are much too static, predictable, and easy. EQs instanced content 
is weak compared to what it should be.
PoK books are overkill. A pok book to gunthak is ridiculous.

The HotSpots are ridiculous. The ZEMs need to be be toned down, not UP, 
people are leveling too fast, and can't equip themselves for the 
mid-high game without twinkage or bought plat or hours farming greens 
for pp or items. Between PC, the Hotspots, and LDoN players aren't 
merely missing most of low & mid content... they *can't experience it 
even if they want to* they simply level so damned fast they spend one 
night here hours and one night there and gain 7 levels, leaving half a 
dozen zones they never got to even see behind.
