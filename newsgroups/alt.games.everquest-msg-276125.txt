That's the "it's new" part.   They don't need to add more
quests or tradeskill recipes until they get all the ones in
the game now working.   Later they'll be able to add
new recipes a lot easier, etc.

One big problem is people comparing it to EQ -- it's
just not EQ.   There's nowhere near the same amount
of content.   That's highly visible in terms of items and
even more true in terms of visible armor.
