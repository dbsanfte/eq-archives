Way, way back, even before Garfield, there was a game supplement set published
by Bard Games:

The Compleat Alchemist
The Compleat Enchanter (or was it Spellcaster?)
and one other I forget.

That developed into a full game named Atlantis or somesuch.

When Bard was folded into the new company, Wizards of the Coast, WotC published
a much revamped Atlantis, called Talislanta, the main book being their first
release.

This was all long before magic was even dreamed up.
