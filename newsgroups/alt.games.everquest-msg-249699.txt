I agree - fantastic Idea.

That was a very exciting run for me too!  infact, the first time I ran to
the druid ring in NK for TP.  There was no Jagged Pines and I think that was
the nearest TP ring for my Halas-based Barbarian Warrior!

Oh, and the first time I accidently ran into the cyclops in EK <run run
run!> followed immediately by a HG <LOADING...>   -  such magnificent
suprises!  Thank the gods I was only level 9 (on purpose) so I could die and
rot without losing my junk!

Nowadays, people create a new toon, run to the book outside their city click
up to POK and never return.
