No, but its asked here constantly. You actually would make more
tailoring leather padding for smiths than tailoring yourself, 80 plat
or more per stack and 40 plat for any hq bear skins you get. The trick
is to do vendor delving in areas you know the spiderling silk and low
to high quality skins will be on vendors (skin the med and high to
low, none are worth keeping except HQ bear) and buy a ton while making
paddings on the spot.

Trade skills, except jewelry if an enchanter, suck more money and time
from you than they make you money. The trick is to instead be the
person making the money by supplying the already busy tradeskill
people.

Vendor delving works in the following way:

You go and select a vendor you know will have some low to high quality
hides while also having spiderling silks and most likely other things
you might want (to build faction or level a low twink) like bone
chips. An example of a good vendor to delve when the server has been
up for longer than 3 days is the wood elf lady newbie lift vendor in
gfay. 

You open up the vendor and you see the player sold items from the
bottom and up a bunch of spots. You then buy out a slot on the vendor
(player sold slot), such as one of cheap stacked items like snake
skins for instance. When the slot is empty, you don't close the vendor
but instead you try to fill the slot. You sell back the vendor one of
the item you might be looking for, like spiderling silk. If the
spiderling silk instantly shows up in that empty spot the vendor has
no more of it so you are out of luck (buy it back right away). If it
DOESN'T show up there its because the vendor has yours and at least
one more. You then refresh the vendor and a new item is in that spot.
You keep doing this until you get the new items showing you want,
usually getting hides or bone chips or other things you were not
thinking about in the meantime.

With an ogre sk on a server that was new to me, starting from scratch,
by level 7 I was relocated to a bind in east freeport and had 45
leather paddings I had either killed the critters for and used a
skinning knife (which I made with 5 smithing skill) or made by buying
out many vendors in neriak of spiderling silk and hides. Neriak is
great for this giving evils an advantage. While doing this I also got
2 HQ bear pelts along the way I sold for 40 plat each. Of course a
higher melee type is best at this who can run around killing bears in
one whack, everfrost on the bear cubs and spiderlings would be
perfect. As a wizard though who can port yourself I think the vendor
buy out way is the way to go. You won't make 80 billion plat in an
hour but you might make more than killing stuff for a bit.
