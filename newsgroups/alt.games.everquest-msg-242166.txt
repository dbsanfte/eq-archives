Here is a list from the Emarr boards, don't know if it is all accurate.

1. There is now a pink box around spell icons. Thank goodness they added 
this instead of wasting time trying to get people back into the game.
2. 'collision' issues have been reassessed. the development team felt 
that autorun was unbalancing to the game, so players will now stick to 
everything they touch.
3. Most zones are now more challenging because they appear empty. Mobs 
must be pulled from thier new spawn points under the world.
4. pet pathing has been improved so that pets will now autofollow rocks 
or trees
5. by popular demand, targetting with the mouse has been made more 
difficult
6. casting invisible on horseback will now make you unable to move
7. normal movement on horseback will now cause the view to shift to the 
inside of your head making it impossible to see
8. some people were having issues with horses being able to climb hills. 
This has been fixed, and horses will now stop for things like a rusty 
weapon on the ground that somebody dropped.
9. The skies are now black and the moon is purple
10. looting your corpse causes serious lag and ld now for some users
11. the new graphics engine causes some systems to crash when opening 
downloaded maps. maps must be deleted and defaults reloaded from patcher
