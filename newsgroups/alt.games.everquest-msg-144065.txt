What about them?  They were charged with crimes against
humanity, AFAIK, not crimes against any specific group.

Not in the same way.  Lack of a motive is relevant;  the
specific motive rarely is.  It doesn't matter as far as the
charge goes if you kill someone for greed or just because
their dog keep digging up your roses;  you still get charged
with premeditated murder.

Umm, you should be held accountable for the crime regardless
of the motive, correct?  So, what's the benefit to society
of creating new law to cover specific motives?

But he does!  He's been charged with a hate crime and the prosectution
has ample evidence of hate.  It doesn't matter that, in this case, the
hate might be a totally seperate issue.  All that matters is that the
prosecution can prove hate.  And, as I pointed out, bringing in that
totally irrelevant charge allows the jury to convict on one (he is,
after all, guilty of hate) and convict on the other (guilty of one,
guilty of all.)

Because with any other crime the jury is specifically charged NOT
to vote their views.  In this case, it's necessarily part of the
decision.  You don't have hate crimes against despised groups.
Or do you seriously think a pedophile could file a hate crime charge
against someone who beats him up simply because he's a pedophile
hanging around a playground?  While the law may allow the charge,
it'd never actually be charged.  No jury would convict solely based
on the idea it's not right to hate pedophiles.

Interesting thought, actually.  Crimes against minors (or the elderly)
often have specific charges.  Why?  Because those are groups that the
general society has deemed worthy of both special protection and has
deemed below-average in their ability to protect themselves.  So I
guess your point is that gays (for one group) are worthy of special
protection and/or unable to protect themselves as well as the "norm"
in society?

And, as long as the motive is free of hate, it's okay?  No, you
obviously don't agree.  So, as long as the person is going to be
charged with the crime itself (murder, assault, whatever) what's
the issue?  IMO, the only issue is that his motive means he's far
less likely to be "rehabilitated" and far more likely to be in the
same position again.

A person who kills his neighbor because he's always blaring his
stereo late at night isn't likely to be put in the same position
again and, after seven or so years in prison, isn't likely to commit
the crime again.  A person who kills someone simply due to their
race/whatever IS more likely to see another person of that group
again and, due to the senseless motive, is more likely to act on it
again and is far less likely to rid themselves of the motive.  The
crime -- premeditated murder -- is the same.  The punishment shouldn't
be.  Not because of the "severity" of the crime; because of the idea
that part of punishment is meant to protect society against repeat
offenders.
