Xylobot now works with DirectX 8 games like EverQuest.  For more
information, go to:

http://www.xylobot.com

Xylobot takes the grunt work out of playing your game, and makes it more
fun.  Xylobot can record keyboard, mouse, and joystick sequences; and then
play back those sequences to the game.  Advanced users can set up triggers
and scripts to respond automatically to game events.  Xylobot also displays
on-screen maps, an in-game web browser, and much much more!
