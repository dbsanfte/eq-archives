Phantasy Star Online I & II dating back to the Sega, and later ported to 
the GameCube have been around for years and have subscription fees. But 
I'm not sure if they're transferable or not.

A consumed activation code renders the game unplayable. In my eyes that 
is a defect. The discs might as well be scratched because that how 
playable the package is now. Any store selling used games warrants that 
the game is not defective.

Seeing as they've got a 'invite your buddy' deal going on there is 
absolutely no reason to pay for the game right now anyhow.
