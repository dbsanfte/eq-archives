Well, if you start practicing your brass skill with the first spell that
uses it, that would be level 18's Denon's Disruptive Discord.  Now, the
locations you mentioned do have guards and, even if you find an area they
don't wander, there is always a chance some silly player could attack a
guard and drag it into range of your DDD.  If you've gone AFK for a few
hours, it could be a nasty surprise to come and find yourself naked at your
bindpoint and having lost experience.  I'm not saying it's LIKELY to happen,
I just prefer to stay out of the way to avoid the possibility.
