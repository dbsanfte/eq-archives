Well, you know, I checked my log just in case, and wow, I *really* feel 
foolish now.

I've been hunting the courtyard in Unrest, and it keeps saving my scaley 
hide when all those assisting and aggressive monsters start ganging up. 
  And I use the healing-up time in between to practice. (Flop, stand, 
sit, wait... flop, stand, sit, wait...)

Yeah.  Worst came to worst, well, I'm bound in PoK and it wouldn't have 
been a *bad* corpse run, just annoying (the way all corpse runs are).  I 
had plenty of time to note my location, at least... and if the 
pop-up-and-run-like-heck idea hadn't worked, I was planning to just 
/quit and hope for the best.

Oh, and according to Illia's Bestiary, Drin's level 22.  One day soon, I 
will go back and have my revenge.  *hisss*
