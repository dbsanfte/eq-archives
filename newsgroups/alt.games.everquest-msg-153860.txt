This robe I'm talking about is white and is all/all. There is a quest to get
it by taking a lost kitty girl back to her father but you can get the robe
just by waiting til she walks down an alley in the city and just knife her
:)

This would be a great robe for weddings and such....I'd just love to see my
ogre shammy in something other than leather and chain.
