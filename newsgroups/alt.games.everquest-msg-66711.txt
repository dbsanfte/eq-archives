Okay first, you might want to overclock to 400 mhz. I have a p2 333
and overclocked it to 400 mhz with just the regular fan it came with.
This let me run at 100 mhz FSB just like you can at p2 350. Basically
the p2 333 - 450 are the same proc, but some are just rated higher so
they get marked 350, 400, etc. I overclocked mine to 450 mhz first but
then windows would crash after coming up. I scaled back to 400 and
have been running it that way now for a year and a half (with my
computer always on for the most part) In all benchmark programs it
meets the performance of a p2 400, etc. It might not make a huge diff
but will make some. If my chip was rated 333 mhz and I have it
overclocked at 400 mhz with nothing more than the fan and heat sink it
came with (not even any thermal paste), then you should have no prob.
Disclaimer, I am not responsible for product meltdowns or your
computer blowing up, do this at your own risk. For the most part
though worst case scenario is it doesn't boot, windows crashes, etc.

>P2-350MHZ(Yes, I know it's slow)
>256MB Ram

Second, I had 128 meg ram and got a 256 meg ram dimm for a total of
384 meg. I have ALL models on and LOW textures. This is the key thing,
LOW TEXTURES. Its NOT the models and social animations which need tons
of mem but having the textures higher than LOW when you go to options.
I have LOW textures and dynamic lighting off and am fine. As an
example of the difference:

With low textures cacheman (www.outertech.com) shows that at worst i
am using 483 meg of  a perm min/max swaipfile of 700 meg (so I could
actually make that smaller.. like 550 meg or something)  Now, when I
move the texture quality to HIGH (what eq, in its sadistic nature
recommends as the DEFAULT for my system.. wtf is verant smoking???) I
crash and note that with my previous perm swap file of 900 meg EQ was
using ALL OF THAT. So the difference between using LOW an HIGH
textures on my system is a WHOPPING HUGE MOTHERLOAD OF AN ASS 450 meg
or something larger cache use (well even more than that since it
crashed)

I tried it both with ALL the models and NONE, and its SURE AS HELL not
the models which make a big diff. So even people with systems like
mine may as well go for it and see the new models.

So you should set textures to low in options, see how that works.

3rd, get a 256 meg dimm. The one I got was like 32 bucks at an outlet
place near me, pc 256 meg pci 133 mhz 168 pin sdram. You may even want
to try getting the geforce 2 64 meg FIRST, setting textures low,
turning on all models and still see if it seems you need another 256
dimm but it would probably greatly improve things. Verant recommends
512 meg ram for a reason.

A LOT. Get the geforce 2 mx 400 64 meg. Its barely more than a 32 meg
and its my next upgrade.  Currently im on a p2 400 with 384 meg ram,
tnt 16 meg agp card. Yeah, thats right i got a tnt 16 meg agp and have
all models enabled and EQ runs pretty good. Yeah, I zone pretty slow
but everyone is that I talk to. My next upgrade is going to be an mx
64 meg and I asked for another 256 meg sdram for xmas. 

What helps the MOST for the textures, especially in luclin, is simply
more memory and that is both system memory and graphics card memory.
The more the better.

Oh, and www.outertech.com  cacheman is a freeware for the most part
for home use caching utility that kicks all ass. It has presets and
does memory saving things like recommend and set your disc cache size
according to the ram you have and stuff and if you check "pc mostly
used for gaming" in its convenient wizards. It set me at a maxfile
cache of 26 meg but I scaled it back to 12 to have even more free mem
for EQ and perform fine. For jollies I limited my file cache to 100
meg and rebooted and cacheman showed that after playing EQ the
discache did indeed grow to 100 meg yet I noticed no improvement in
performance. Cacheman does not manage your virtual mem swap file size,
you still have to do that in control panel but it does manage
swapping. Its also useful because you can see just how much you
actually use. 

Luclin slowed me down to, but with 256 more memory, textures set to
low, all models enabled (even horsies and new elementals) and clipping
set just a notch or two from the VERY bottom (the clipping seemed to
change and also REALLY can lag your graphically) I am actually doing
pretty darn good.
