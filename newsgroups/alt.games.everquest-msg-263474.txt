HeHe, first thing to do is develop a thick skin and you're good to go! 
In this and in the CoH newsgroup I had and have been accused of being 
arrogant etc., I put this down to my job (Director of Programming as in 
coding all day long) where terse messages are the norm due to the 
enormous load of emails we must endure from each other and customers 
participating in the early stages of program development. That is 
entirely MY fault. You cannot see the smirk or wink behind a comment on 
usenet.

Major props on stepping up!
