the idea of orcs, elves, etc, is not copyrightable

the expression of those things in sony's world is copyrightable

i'm still not violating their copyright since i paid money to own the
software and am free to use it in ways that do not violate the
relevant copyright statutes


whether or not i'm creating a parody or derivate work, etc, is a
different issue...i think it comes down to no one's taking money from
SOE, they're not hurt at all, so any liability would be moot

however, this is usenet, so let's discuss it to death ^_^



someone research such things and let us know =P
