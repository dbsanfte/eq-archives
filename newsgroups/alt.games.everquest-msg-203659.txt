well, since my router didn't get along with the power surge during a 
thunderstorm last week, I can't play EQOA and EQ at the same time for a 
while.  This means hubby will be hogging the internet all day and I'll 
barely be able to keep up with the group, and I can't even think about 
playing EQOA until I get a new one, which at this rate will be 5 minutes 
after never.
