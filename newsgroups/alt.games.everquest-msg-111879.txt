Of course.

Agreed. That's a possibility, but if I were a bettin' man, that's not
where I'd be putting my money. If they DID handle, for example, fine
plate and dyed fine plate objects like the above example, then I would
be REAL interested to hear their reasoning. All things being equal, it
would be a programming faux pas.
