For quite a few years when I began programming, the max
addressable memory for a program was 64kb (16-bit addressing).
No overlays, no virtual memory.  64kb, period.

It's amazing how much you can fit into 64kb if you have to,
and how much you learned about efficient programming practices.
I developed good habits that even today keep my programs
small and lean.

The idea of a program that requires 512MB to run smoothly
still boggles my mind.
