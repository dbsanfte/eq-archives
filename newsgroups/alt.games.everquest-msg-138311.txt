umm aren't hoppers in dawnshroud level 40 or there abouts?   I know I 
had a group of 40+ who were wiped out by the hoppers in dawnshroud one 
time, that's what they get for having a ranger pull and not having a 
decent healer.

Mayhap you meant Marus seru? Carefull there, the durn lightcrawlers can 
see you coming from halfway across the zone and they run like lightning.
