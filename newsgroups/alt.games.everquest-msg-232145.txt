Indeed, since the emergency itself bypasses effective competition, this is
proper.  However, the laws against price gouging do not prevent the seller
from legally increasing the price, but rather limits how much it can be
raised.

OTOH, many companies (like Home Depot) have been known to donate gear or
sell at a loss in the interest of disaster relief.  Dunno if they take it as
a tax write-off, but still.
