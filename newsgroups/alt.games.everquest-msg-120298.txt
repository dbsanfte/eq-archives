Just a quick note on zoom spells.
I routinely use them when in a group in dungeons where we are pulling
from down a long corridor.  Many times I have saved a puller from a
nasty surprise by spotting a mob that was partially hidden behind a
corner or another mob.

Sure it's not usually a major saver but it is an advantage and costs
so little mana, you might as well be prepared.

Also, I have used it in large plain type zones (in good weather) as a
feeble replacement for track.  I find if I am parked with some others
and we are all waiting for a mob to come by, a zoom spell lets me get
there first.  Of course a tracking class shuts you down, but still
sometimes it helps me get the second or third mob while the tracker is
busy killing.

Most spells have some use, if not spectacular if you use your
imagination.  To me, that is what makes a caster stand out from the
rest.
