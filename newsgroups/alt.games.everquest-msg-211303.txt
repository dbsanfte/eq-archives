The boglings aren't out very often, and generally have a smallish agro
radius. It's really not that big a deal to just do it visible. I've done
the quests a few dozen times and only been killed once. Even running the
level 2 and 3 guys thru, there isn't much risk from the boglings. If the
boglings are out, I just run around them and don't sweat it.

Needlites, on the other hand, if they are dangerous to you, are more
problematic. They aren't out roaming very often, but they hit way fast.
As a L24 cleric, you'd be unlikely to get much off other than DA. Then
you'd just have to run to zone or guards.

Advice: boglings, just run around them. needlites, lead them to guards
if you are in a hurry, or come back another time when they're gone.

Oh yeah, speaking of which. You could always just Divine Aura past the
boglings if you felt they were too much. It's 18 seconds of invulnerability.
Should be enough to get you to a zone line or guard without too much sweat.

Oh yeah #2. And in addition to Trade Commissioner Henry quests, be sure to
look up the SH faction quests for Hardam and Steaion. Both are guys in SH
who need you to deliver something to Bazaar. As long as you're going back
and forth between SH and Bazaar for TCH anyway...
