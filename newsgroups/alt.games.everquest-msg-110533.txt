Well none of the stuff is "illegal" yet. If you mean does verant not
like it, they won't really say. They don't like something that gives
you an advantage like showeq, but EQW just lets you play in a window
which gives you zero advantage. 

Some time ago verant said they no longer scan for files on your
computer and EQW is even made to run from a fully different DIR. So
unless you are a total goof and page a GM and say "HEY, I'M RUNNING EQ
IN A WINDOW, JUST SO YOU KNOW!" Its nothing to worry about. I'd not
mention it to anyone at all and keep it private.

Running EQ in a window has nothing to do with hacking or whatever, as
a real hack like Showeq demonstrates (don't need EQ running in a
window at all for that) It is simply a convenience for the user and
letting the user have control over the desktop realestate and his own
operating system, as he should have.

Yes, as far as I know if you have 2 everquest accounts you can run two
instances of EQW (though you might need two everquest directories
also) I've heard at least one person state they do this on the same
computer via EQW. I'd guess you'd have to have a pretty darn hefty
machine (or perhaps keeping one window minimized much of the time
helps)
