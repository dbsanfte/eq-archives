Different game, whole different set of circumstances. One factor they've 
pretty much eliminated is gear-flation. That gives them much more to 
work with in balancing an encounter than just upping the mob's HP and 
damage output. Also, as I understand it, there is now a limit on raid 
numbers? As such, encounters are no longer so easily trivialized.

So you wanted access to leading edge content at earlier levels than 
necessary without benefit of the primary tanking specialist class.

I'm sorry. I still don't see any huge problem there. Find a warrior to 
do the job or wait a couple of levels and do it with the next best tank. 
I don't understand why SK's and Paladins are created knowing full well 
that they are second-best tanks, yet still can't get over the fact that 
they are the second-best tanks 60 levels later when it actually first 
becomes true.

See above. Leading edge (or most difficult) encounters should involve 
optimum situations, IMO. The biggest challenge for the devs should 
involve making sure the hybrid classes always have a roll to play, even 
when that role isn't one of the main two or three.

Again, leading edge...

Honestly, isn't that a little like having your cake and eating it too?

WoW appeals to me in a whole different way. I don't approach it with the 
same mindset I do with EQL and EQ2. As such, I've stopped comparing 
them, as they each offer me their own form of enjoyment.

Fair enough. It probably just boils down to difference of opinion on 
what the perfect MMORPG *should* be like.
