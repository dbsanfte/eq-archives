I am running a P3-1.2GHz, and I never turn the clip plane down.  The 
bazaar sucks, and I use overhead view, on raids, I turn off effects, and 
the sky.  I do have 1GB of 133MHz SRam, and I do have a GF4 ti-4200 video 
card.  I always run at 1280x1024, used to do the same with a P3-800 and a 
GF2 MX-400.  Even with the older system, I was still able to attend raids 
and such.  I do have all Luclin models on as well, did with both old and 
new systems.

If your system is at least as good as the one I described, then your 
issues are not due to the system alone.
