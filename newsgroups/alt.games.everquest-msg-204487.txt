The amount of exp you get for the quest drops as you level up, but I've
also seen it said that it drops the more its done, until the next patch.
Supposedly each patch refreshes this list so that you get great exp from
it for a while and then it drops back off.

I have -no- idea if this latter is true, never bothered testing it out.
In general, I find I can get more experience and cash actually killing
stuff in the time it took to do this quest, several times my bard did it
enough to level and get a bit of a buffer with when close to leveling,
because somehow he tended to die shortly before leveling doing anything
risky.
