Three things to factor in. One, Forager sometimes spawns into named
MoBs in his place, two, high levelers agro and drag him through the
zone to Seb, and three, a dr00d may come along and pull him away off
your tracking. Basically I find hunter on track at the EJ zoneline and
forager on my track while sitting at the cave to Swamp of No Hope.
Their wanders do cross at times at those two spots and they both will
show up. But for the most part you will mostly see the one on track at
those spots.
