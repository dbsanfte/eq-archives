This is/was a common occurence, I doubt has anything to do with accounts
being "hacked" but who really knows.
You'll sometimes get the infamous "it was my little brother" excuse after a
GM warning.

What to do in this situation
/report <retard's name>
/petition please see report under <retard's name> spamming abuse in Bazaar.

/ignore <retard's name>

Politely request anyone who insists on argueing with said retard to stop and
follow the above steps.
Anyone who carrys on argueing add to /ignore.

Most common around the release of an alternative game, DAoC brought out
plenty in it's time so Malakai is very likely right that this is an SWG
player but one who is quitting EQ not upset over SWG's content,
Unfortunately, you might be saying good ridance but AB is a Euro server and
so there is high possibilty I will be getting, or already have, this fuck
knuckle on my server
/sigh.
Hope he does think SWG is shit...That's all I can say.

As Biz said, it's no big deal. Used to happen all the time in EC, before the
Bazaar.
