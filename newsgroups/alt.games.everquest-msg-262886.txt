Fair enough. :)

By preventing them from having any reason to or deriving any joy from 
killing ice goblins/giants for the axe, cape, etc etc in their 20s or 
30s or 40s. In general when you twink a true noobie for the next several 
months he loots mob after mob after mob and never sees a better item 
then the one you gave him at level 2. Then they do a quest... and the 
result is worse then the item you gave them at level 2. 

They look around, and the only item they can get that's better than 
stuff you gave him at level 2 drops from 55th level mobs...

This can be disheartening.

And later if they still play when they look at back at their memories of 
their first character... all they remember is getting twinked, and not 
seeing anything really worth doing but grinding xp/pp for 55 levels. 
(And then perhaps they decide that buying pp for cash is ok because they 
think having to grinding 55 levels before you see anything worth getting 
is stupid, and they're for anything that speeds it up.)

These people will never have a PGT or Dragoon dirk still sitting in the 
bank as a sentimental trophy. 

Its just one perspective; and I'm not saying your doing anything 
'wrong' but I think it robs them of their innocence. You only get one 
shot to be impressed with the very first Magic weapon you get...and I'd 
rather it be from a kill than from someones 'pile of junk barely worth 
carrying all the way to a merchant'. The former is a much better memory.

The lottery is just another tax on those that can least afford it, imo.
