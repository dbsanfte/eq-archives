This is how horses work, anyway, I've heard lizardmounts work the same way.

You'll regen mana while running, casting spells, standing still, using clicky
effects off items,  but not while attack is on, even if  your target is out of
melee range.

It would be possible, if you use a slow two hander, to turn off attack and turn
it back on when your weapon un-greys, just long enough to swing; I used to do
something similar as a melee cleric (only I had to sit down cause I had no
horse).

The trick here is that mana is regenerated not steadily, not proportional to the
percentage of time you spend on your butt, but rather in chunks at the tick; if
you are sitting (or ahorse and not attacking) -at- the tick you get the full
"sitting" mana regen, if you aren't, then you get the "standing" regen for that
tick.  If you click on and off quickly, you're often spending a half second out
of every tick ineligible for the med bonus, odds are strong you'll get it.  The
slower your weapon the less often you miss the bonus.

This is terrible tactics if you need to maintain aggro as MA, but nice if you
aren't MA or are soloing, get a weapon with a great ratio but slow attack time;
given a similar ratio your damage output should be similar to the "fast one
hander" plan... but as a paladin I'll wager you can actually come up with a
better ratio weapon in two hand mode; unlike a warrior who gives up some of the
advantages of two one handers, which you can't use.

Hmm, I don't move around so much, but I thought moving didn't matter.  Perhaps
it does.

If you aren't the puller, you'll be surprised how much time you spend standing
around.  Not having to sit means things add up nicely.

Also, as a paladin, consider the DW helm.  Clicky heal, very nice, but the
drawback is you aren't medding while you use it.  With a horse, you are looking
at no lost mana regen while you are quite rapidly healing up to full between
fights; I'd guess paladins would benefit quite a bit from this feature alone.
