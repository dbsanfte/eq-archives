I thought I read somewhere that it was going to be zoneless, which will
help.  People tend to crowd in around zone lines for safety, missing out on
a lot of good hunting grounds, and making the zone seem more crowded than it
really is.

With a zoneless world, people should spread out more, allowing a lot more
people in a zone than you might be used to.
