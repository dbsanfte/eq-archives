    Nagafen/Vox is usually a person's first ever raid. So you get some
really interesting folks showing up, people who have never raided in their
lives and some who you swear have never grouped in their lives. Stuff like
the above is par for the course.

    I'd do it until you've got a handle on basic raid protocols. Pickup
raids are also good places to meet people around your level and network with
guild types. But never go expecting to get loot or even keep the same level
of XP.
