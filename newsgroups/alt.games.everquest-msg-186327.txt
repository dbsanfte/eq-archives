61/62 spells are cheap, and most are also crap.  Unfortunatly I can't sell
them to vendors either, so I have 3 copies of Fury of Ro sitting on my
bazaar bot at 200pp each.  I expect them to sell sometime around when Satan
and I have a snowball fight.

I ended up with most of my 61/62 spells soloing in PoD, only paid about 5-8k
total for the ones that I had a hard time getting on turn in (and Imbue
Storm).  On the other hand for my level 60 spells I paid 15k for Moonfire,
7k for Mask of the Stalker, 700 for PotG, 300 for Entrapping Roots, 150 for
Banishment, and 6k for Nature's Recovery.  I still don't have Mask of the
Hunter (but it's a direct downgrade from stalker so I don't care to get it
either), or Form of the Hunter (but wolf form sucks so no big loss there).
