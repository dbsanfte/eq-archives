Well, you can prove anything with figures.
Another analysis:
I'm in the same timezone as Blew, so get hit by all the same patches. I'm
a casual to moderate player (self-labelled).
I guess with other interests and commitments out of the way, plus time
for my loved ones squeezed in here and there, I can play maybe 3 nights a
week (for an arbitrarily sized session), plus maybe two sessions on the
weekend (usually on the same day).
So, 5 sessions. This week, I hypothetically have had all three possible
weeknight sessions taken up by the patch. That's three out of five
completely gone.
And let's say I was unlucky in this four-week month and had another two
sessions removed by other weekly patches. That's five sessions gone, out
of twenty in total. A quarter of my intended EQ time is gone. That's
rather more than 1/36th. If I had that US$3.25 back I could buy another
pint of Guinness.

But is it that much trouble? No, not really. There are other things I can
do. I certainly wouldn't sign up for EQ Legends on service levels like
that, though (regardless, I doubt with my non-standard online hours I'd
get much out of Legends anyway). My gripe here: I understand the need to
patch at the time they do, and I can plan my time around patches, but
would it kill them to list upcoming patches in the server MOTD? They have
the capacity to do it, and it would be a damn sight more considerate and
more accessible than some random Station webpage somewhere.

Bah.

But anyway, I love the game (except druids), despite its many flaws. I
didn't even get affected by the patch horror last week since I spent many
many hours reinstalling everything on my PC after one of my drives
bollocksed itself up. If I'm going to demand a refund from anyone it's
going to be IBM...

Cheers,
