 Not to the experienced player, perhaps. But the first time player
powerleveling their first character is a bad idea, particularly if that
character is an Enchanter. Maybe you don't mind being in a group with an
inexperienced enchanter but the rest of the EQ community probably would.

 If the person being PLed knows about the game and each class, it's
probably not that big a deal. Personally I prefer being with characters
who know what they are doing and who earned/learned their levels the
hard way.

 Once again though, you're lumping everyone together based on your
(percevied) 'uberness'. Not necesarily a flame, but try getting off your
horse sometime.
