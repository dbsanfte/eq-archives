>Hi y'all... Since I play at such erratic times, it's really hard to find people I can play with on a consistent basis.  So, I decided to create a "BYOG" 3-person trio.  Now, I'm at the level where I need advice on a hunting grounds.  What I'm ideally looking for is a spot that a puller can pull do, with a limited amount of adds.  A spot tailored to a tank, that has healers.  (Basically, I find it difficult to cast anything other than heals & buffs with the occasional DD/DoT thrown in).  Anyways, I suppose I should lay out the group setup...
