My funniest experience as a Wizard:

Fighting, grouped with a Monk in Oasis, near the shoreline of spectre lake.
I forget what level I was but I do remember that the "A orc warrior's" were
still very red to me. Well, the monk doesn't conn it, and thinks it's a
normal "An orc warrior"... things went down hill very fast.

The monk got down to about a bbl of health and tries to FD, and failed. Of
course he died immediately, and then Mr. Orc looks over at the Wizzy who had
been tickling him with spells (that he had mostly resisted anyway), and
gives me "the look".

"Ahh", I think, as he's pounding me for a bbl of health every round...
perhaps I should do something now. I had just enough mana for a shadowstep,
which I fired off successfully at around 2bbls of health.

I reappeared in a part of Oasis that I'd never been before... as I turned in
a circle to get a better idea of where to run, the last thing I saw was the
Spectre closing in for the kill. Yup, I ST'd to the edge of the top of
Spectre Island  = )
