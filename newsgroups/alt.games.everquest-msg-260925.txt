Hopefully there will be some tuning with this.

I can't speak to the red mob issue, because I haven't had to kill any mobs
for a task yet.  I did two tasks last night with my little 24 chanter.  Both
were "Go here, then go there, then speak to Npc_01 somewhere else" type of
progressions.  Grand total was a yellow of XP and a handful of plat
(something like 12 plat and change).  All were centered around Kunark, so
Illusion:Iksar was a big help.

Not too bad for an hour's outlay of time, really.  But again, I never had to
fight anything.
