Atticus is currently level 26.  AC is his god right now.  Wis, as I
see it, is just not that important.  The only spells that I HAVE to
cast in combat are Snare and, on occasion, Root.  Neither are
particularly expensive spells.  

Now at 30 I get my first decent DoT and then mana is gonna get tight
fast.  Particularly considering my Conjuration skill is at like 20.

I figure that a rangers FIRST job is to be a damage dealer.  AC is god
because rangers are delicate little flowers and can't take much
punishment.  Str is second because it has a real effect on melee
damage.  Dex is a personal choice for me because I like the idea of my
character being an archer AND because I understand that archery can
become a viable method of doing significant amounts of damage at
higher levels.  Wisdom is last on that list because all ranger spells
are, at best, just for utility.  Helpful, but not a make or break
issue in combat.
