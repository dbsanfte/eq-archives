After you install and register you're prompted to select a server. There are a
bunch of them, and different servers have different rules - some are
Player-versus-Player (PvP), some are Player-versus-NPC, and the Firiona Vie
server encourages roleplaying.

>And how?

Once you select a server you are prompted to create a character. You have a lot
of race/class combinations from which to choose. You can create up to eight
characters per server, and you can create characters on as many servers as you
like.

>Does it take months and months and months and.....

It's up to you to determine your ultimate goal in this game, so the amount of
time you spend doing so is open-ended.
