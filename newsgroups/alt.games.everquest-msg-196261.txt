Funny you should say that, I just spent yesterday evening tanking dark blue  
mushrooms in FG.  Yes, I had my pet to add to the damage, and, yes, I did 
DoT them and slow them of course.  With Replenishment going, I ended the 
fights with the same amount of hp I started them at (no heals used).  I do 
realize that is the exception, most of the mobs that I take on solo or in a 
group, I could not even consider tanking.  Also tanked a few of the Dreggs, 
but they are a bit tougher.
