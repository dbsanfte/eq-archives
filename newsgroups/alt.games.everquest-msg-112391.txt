First, don't buy armor from NPC merchants.  They sell at outrageous
prices.  Buy armor from other players.  You can get banded (player
made) armor for 1 platinum piece per point of AC.  I believe the
banded tunic is AC 15, much better than leather.  Dropped armor you
can buy would be ringmail and bronze.  Ringmail is heavier and has
less AC than banded; it has a chain look.  Bronze, which is much
heavier than banded but has a golden plate look, has similar AC values
and is sold by players for 1 platinum per AC point on my server.  

When in town or at a druid ring, auction that you want to buy armor,
ringmail, banded, or bronze for 1 pp per point of AC and you will get
buyers from those players about to dump it to the NPC merchants.
Mention whether you want medium or small armor as the small armor is
lighter for dwarf and elf paladins.  As you get pieces, you can chnage
your auction so that you are looking only for specific pieces (e.g.
/auction looking for 1 bracer and boots for a dwarf paladin - paying
1pp per AC for bronze or ringmail.  

If you are a dwarf or elf, get maps and go to Mistmoore.  Hug the
walls in Lesser Feydark to avoid the brownies and avoid the Dark Elf
camp against the wall on the way there.  Once in Mistmoore, auction
you want to buy small bronze armor.  You're probably too low to fight
there without a good group of level 20's letting you in but you can
probably pick up a lot of bronze cheaply from the higher levels there
who want to drop the weight or bronze armor and fine steel weapons.
(You can get exp as long as no one in the group is above level 21.)
