make sure that you snuck correctly, sometimes it doesn't work right. 
Also make sure your BEHIND the guy alot of times it doesn't work they 
can see you in the corner of there eye. If your not kos and they are in 
a corner hail them so they will turn around giving you more room to 
sneak. These are just some of the things i learned with my shaman. 
Before you saw a shaman that sneaks!?!? My shaman is a vah shir.

Another question about the factions there. I wanta do the hero bracer 
quest for a alt or two of mine, What is the best way to get the faction 
high enough there without hurting my other factions baddly? I was 
thinking about putting a dent into the gnoll population in BB.
