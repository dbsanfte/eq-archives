I see nothing wrong with awarding points for guild-assisting
activities beyond simple attendance, even though encouraging
attendance is one of the primary reasons for implementing
a points system.

It's not an either-or issue.  Clearly some of both is involved.

There's also a third component, which is that people join raid-level
guilds to achieve their *own* advancement, not to selflessly "improve
the guild".  It's a mistake to ignore the fact that ultimately
the guild exists to help its members do things they couldn't do
on their own -- the guilds doesn't exist for its own 
self-perpetuation.

Just as labor unions or government bureaucracies all too often
forget why they were created and end up serving their own
needs (or the needs of its entrenched management) instead of
the needs of the "little guys" they were created to serve,
big guilds sometimes make the mistake of thinking that
"improving the guild" is an end to itself, instead of a
way to help all its members achieve their individual goals.

For example, it's easy for a big guild to fall into the
trap of awarding all uber-loot to its uberest raiders,
because this arguably makes the guild able to tackle
larger targets.  This improves "the guild" as an entity,
but it doesn't do jack for the mass of little guys without
whom the guild couldn't raid at all (try raiding with
just the uber tank, the uber puller, and the uber clerics).

And sooner or later, the "little guys" will realize that
the advancement of "the guild" (i.e., the core officers
and raiders) isn't doing *them* any good, and they'll
move on.

See above.

Or maybe it is the system, and the main tanks are satisfied
with it because the "main tanks" get the lion's share of the
upgrades, and thus don't want to face the complaints of the
people who are being left out -- because changing the status
quo would detrimentally affect the main tanks' share.

On the other hand, I know what you mean about "drama queens".
We had to eject a few from our raiding alliance because
they stirred up too much friction -- and we don't even
have a points system yet so that couldn't have been a
factor.
