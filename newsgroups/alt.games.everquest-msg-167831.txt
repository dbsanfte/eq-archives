Sounds like the guy who was selling at 450pp is a dick.  I have no problem
with the bazaar free market, but it's sure a pisser when there are people
who will sell at a loss.  If you had the money, I'd suggest possibly buying
all of his stock and reselling it at a more reasonable price.  This topic
was hit on not too long ago in the newsgroup.  Only problem is, if you
cannot buy everything he has AND everything the proceeds of those sales
would allow him to make after the sale, buying him out isn't really an
option.
