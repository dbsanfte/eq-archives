Greetings,

Having recently reached level 47, as a cleric I am finding that I keep
getting invited on open raids for both Naggy and Vox, to date all of which I
have turned down due to low Magic, Cold and Fire resists.

My wis is 185 and I have been told that it's ok to substitute some wis for
resistance items when doing these raids. Unbuffed resists are all around 32
IIRC.

I have listed below what I'm currently wearing (stats from memory), can
anyone please advise me on some of the items I should be looking for to
increase my resists without losing too much wis.

Face - Velium Ruby Veil wis8
Head - Nightshade Wreath wis5
Ears - 2 x Forrest Loops wis3
Fingers - 2 x Velium Jasper Rings wis7
Primary - Dark Ember wis5 SF7
Secondary - CGS wis9
Legs - Gator Scale Leggings wis4
Wrists - Cleric Quest Bracers wis5
Chest - Cleric Quest BP
Arms - Ulthork Hide Arms wis3
Shoulders - Adomantite Epaulets wis7
Hands - Gauntlets of the Black wis3
Feet - Cleric Quest Boots
Neck - Chysoberl Talisman (sp) wis3
Range - Seal from Thurgadin Shawl quest wis3
Waist - Girdle of the Diligent wis5

Also what items should I look to replace in general in an attempt to hit 200
wis.

Thanks in advance
