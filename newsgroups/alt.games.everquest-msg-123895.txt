If I was insecure I'd do exactly like this guy did & try to get a pat on the
back for my computer. Truth of the matter is if money were no object intel
would be the choice by most. Intel sells plenty of chips, wonder who are
buying the overpriced things?  I would never run an AMD chip because I don't
have to. Maybe because I remember the days of AMD & Cyrix, both were crap &
all you saps used Intl.....
