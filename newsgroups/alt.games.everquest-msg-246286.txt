*Grumbles* Yeah, no one under 50 will do any theme outside of
Mistmoore, and very few from 51 to 60. I find Rujarkian and Miragul's
both to be plenty easy, and, while it's harder, don't find Guk to be
that hard... Takish is about equal with Guk, IMO, but that opinion
comes from getting charmed through 100+mr at level 30 every time I've
gone in there. >< Everyone's too concerned about being able to breeze
through the themes with little trouble, though.

I just get tired of seeing vampires every time I do an adventure.
