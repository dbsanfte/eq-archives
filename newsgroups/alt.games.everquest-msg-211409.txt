I believe I was the one who drug out that tired old pearl of wisdom, so I'll
respond.

To me, it's just a game.  A way to pass the time, no different from playing
golf.  Now, do I get frustrated playing golf?  Sure I do.  Do I get
agitated?  You betcha.  Does it make me mad when some moron who thinks he's
Tiger Woods spends 15 minutes analyzing every shot and won't let me play
through, so that it ends up taking me 5+ hours to play 18?  Oh yeah, you'd
better believe it does.

Do I let it ruin the rest of my day.  No.  It's just golf.

Now, substitute EQ for golf and you see where I'm coming from.  Believe it
or not, honest to God it's just a way to pass the time for me.  Do I have
opinions about the game?  You betcha.  Am I passionate about them?  Some of
them, yes (see your favorite KEI thread of choice).  If someone tromps all
over the camp I've been on for the past couple of hours then insists I was
never there, sure it cranks me off.  I may even get pissy about it.  But
once I log for the night, it's over.

Does everyone think like I do?  Probably not ... but I can't speak for
anyone but myself.

Crash
