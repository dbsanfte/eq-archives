 Amen.

Few classes are more familiar with the nerf bat than druids, so we've
learned to adapt. The huge rush of druids grinding exp off stuff like
burrowers was sparked by the exp nerf (personally, I played lowbie
alts till they came to their senses).

A class with spells will always have more adaptability than a pure
melee class. Monks cannot work around this exp nerf.
