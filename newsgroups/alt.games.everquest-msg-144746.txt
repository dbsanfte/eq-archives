Easy, one is a melee. I could easily do this with my cleric and sk or
druid and sk. Start the sk a meleeing, ignore things like bash or
taunt for the most part, switch to druid or cleric and heal. Switch to
sk occasionally for a spell maybe.

Melees honestly don't do much more than take hits and auto swing a
sword, so the healer character can be paid attention to the most.
