Hell, I'd pay for it...

Even if they didn't want to release a multi-player version for
fear of competing with their new games, I'd pay a one-time charge
to get a single-player copy of EQ that just let me wander
around the zones, hail the guards, smack some Orc Pawns, etc.

Years from now it'd be nice to be able to revisit the world
of Norrath and stroll the lands again to reminisce.
