*shrug*  The closest thing to RL law we have in-game contradicts
you.  And as to the stupidity of the act, that is actually another
reason to grab the stuff.  A painful lesson like that is often
very educational, one could reasonably hope that the overall
stupidity level of the player community would be slightly decreased
as a result.

Nope.  But if I logged on after he was off, thus missing his message,
and saw a bag on the ground, I might well choose to pick it up.  If
ever it actually happens I'll let you know.

Apples and oranges, the usual danger of arguing by analogy.  Somebody
transferring gear between characters is _not_ obliged to do a drop
transfer.  It is an optional act, and very risky.

I well recall the first time I drop transferred gear with substantial
value (FBSS, full Crafted, assorted weapons, jewelry and other armor
pieces), it was quite nerve wracking.  Why?  Because somebody could have
come into the room and grabbed everything, leaving me with no recourse
at all.  Can't even bitch about it without being ridiculed, best course
is to eat the loss in silence if it happens.  It would really suck.
It would also be entirely my own fault.

He made off with stuff that didn't belong to anybody.  More specificly,
he made off with stuff that has the same status as any ground spawn.

Well, I actually got even more carried away with it than that before
I rediscovered the delete key, heh, but I left that much in because
I find the accusations of theft to be rather carried away.

*chuckle* I'd be rather concerned (or at least confused) if you
were unhappy about it.  :-p


Kaev <--- ooh, ooh, I get to make another arrow sig!  :)
