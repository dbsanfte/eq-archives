The balance issue is well known.  Warriors have been left behind by
every class with a manabar, not just knights.  Warriors have gotten
nothing but silence from SOE in response to their complaints and
requests for some sort of upgrade to bring them in line with the
rest of EQ.  The manaflow boost, no, that's not right... the HUGE
increase in manaflow from ridiculously long-lasting KEI, mid-hi
Beastlord buffs, hi level Druid buffs, horses (applies in PoP), AA,
and FT items has changed the world, and Warriors have been left
behind.  Knights and Warriors compete for tanking spots in XP groups,
knights have benefited from the manaflow explosion in a way that
directly complements the transformation of casters into high-agro
sustained DPS classes, Warriors have gotten jack-shit out of the deal.
So now, frustrated by SOE's non-response to their problems, they quit
trying to get their class fixed and turn on what they see as their
nearest competitors.  Paladins become the preferred target over SKs
because there are a few pathetic asswipes who happen to play Paladins
and have been trolling the Warrior (and FoH?) boards.

Furor, OTOH, has no excuse.  He has nothing more to defeat in EQ, so
now he's gonna try and get his jollies by griefing the entire player
population, one class at a time.

Sorry, he's obviously intelligent and manipulative.  He was trolling,
trying to get a rise out of people, and I called him on it.  His words
were chosen carefully to suit his purpose, look again at his first
two posts in the thread.  His word choices and phrasing are calculated.
You and Ben are trying to convince me to cut him some slack, it ain't
gonna happen.  Every nuance of his first two posts is the result of
deliberate choice.  There's nothing accidental until he tried to get
too cute responding to one of my questions.

Oh, one more thing.  I hope you noticed his response to my question as
to how nerfing knights was going to help Warriors hold agro...
<crickets chirping>
I'm assuming you didn't miss his little tear-jerker about how hard it
is to play at his level, and how his Warriors just couldn't hold agro
the way that was required to succeed, and this is why knights must be
nerfed.  After he posted that load of shit there was no more chance
that I would even consider giving him anything but the bum's rush.

That is not how it ought to be.  Nobody but a few trolls is arguing
against the idea that Warriors should be the ultimate tank.  Raid
boss mobs that are preferentially tanked by a hybrid ought to be
incredibly rare, perhaps even non-existent.  Tanking is a big deal
to knights, but it's the only deal to Warriors.  When you gather a
sizable raid force to take on a mob that is a serious challenge to
that force, Warrior should be the preferred choice for MT, and ought
to be the only choice if you want decent odds of success.

Aye, and in groups there is rarely more than one tank-class character.
Easy choice then.  It's wrong if Warriors arent the best choice to MT
raid content, or challenging raid content anyway.  Souds like that part
of the endgame is broken.  It ought to be fixed.  But when SOE fixes
the endgame it can easily have horrific results for the casual player,
EQ is a very complex system (I'm including the players as part of the
"system" here) and it's incredibly easy to fix one thing and thereby
break a score of others (manaflow fixed caster sustained DPS, but it
has very nearly obsoleted Warriors, for instance).

I don't think it's necessary to leap directly from the Warrior Taunt
level of agro management to the knight spell plus knight taunt level.
That's a mighty big leap.

I don't play at that level, so I can't really comment on it (well I
could, but I'd be talking through my hat).  If, as you say, it would
address a big piece of the imbalance at high level, then perhaps it
would bea good thing to do.  But I can tell you that Warriors are
hurting some already by mid-50s which your suggestion wouldn't touch.

At least you aren't suggesting an an agro nerf, I can't imagine SOE
getting that one right in a hundred years.  To do it right, they'd
have to go over pretty much every spell in the game, possibly adding
many new spells so that the reduced agro on hybrid spells (have to
do Ranger and Beastlord as well, or the casters would just use them
as agro magnets instead of the knights) didn't screw up intentional
high agro as a _disadvantage_ on spells cast by robes and priests.
And even then outdoor zones might well become nearly devoid of tanks
except in certain very select areas.
