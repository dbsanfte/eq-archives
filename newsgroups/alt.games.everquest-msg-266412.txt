Do it. I quit playing over a year ago, and it was the best thing I ever did. 
MMORPG's are bad things.  Will I go on TV and whine about it?  No.  Your 
time is what you make it.
Why did I come back here tonight?  I heard EQ2 was released and was just 
fielding out a reaction.  Personally I feel it will be the same game, 
repackaged.  Nothing to see here...just new graphics.  I could be wrong, but 
"oh well".
Monual...once, about 3 years ago, you gave me some PP.  That was cool.  You 
are a good person.  Give up the game.  Move on.  There is a real world out 
there worth living.

Good luck in life.
