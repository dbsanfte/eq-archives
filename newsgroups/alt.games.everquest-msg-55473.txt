You can do anything you want with the monsters inventory. Drop the items or
destroy the items and coin. You can even kill other monsters and level up
some. =)
I leveled up a large rat in East Freeport to level 3. Imagine the newbies
surprise that forgets to con you first.

You can not however loot other monsters or pick up items. You do not get XP
for killing players or other player control monsters yet either which I
think sucks.
