This is a weird topic for me, since I'm not 100% sure I understand the
concept of "twinking."  It's either using high-end items from high-end
PCs on low-level PCs, or using large sums of pp to out-and-out BUY
items for low-level PCs.

Anyway, a friend of mine that has been into EQ for a long time (I had
no idea, only found out at work today that he even played, and then
only because I mentioned it as something I'd just gotten into) is
thinking of stripping down some of the excess off one or two
characters he no longer uses, and offered me about 40,000(!) pp to use
on my new characters if I wished.  He offered items initially (a few I
understood, like a Wormslayer weapon, a Centi Longsword, Iskar
chestplate of something), but since I don't know a lot about the game,
the pp seemed better, since I can squirrel some away for spells.

The question is, who is easiest to shop for (I'm thinking of breaking
it down among two brand new PCs, and not "tainting" anyone I've been
using and trying to build up on my own)?  What would be some good
items that would help without terribly overbalancing the character(s)?

Here are the characters I was considering creating for this idea,
since I've never used them before, and hopefully I won't ruin things
too badly;

Dwarven Cleric

Dark Elven Shadowknight

Dark Elven Necromancer (I have one, but I liked getting her to L3
honestly, it seems a shame to "twink" her, so I might create a new
one)

Val Shir Beastmaster


What would be some good items to pick up that would help without being
overpowering -- or alternately, what would one really incredible item
be that would help each?

Or, should I simply refuse overall, since this runs the risk of
spoiling my ability to play and understand these characters?

Thanks in advance for any advice anyone can offer.

I'm leaving my friend's name out only because, if this is a bad/unfair
thing, I don't want him in trouble because of me -- as for the items I
rejected, I suspect he may sell them at the bazaar on Solusek Ro or
Tunare someday -- unless he has other friends to give them away to (I
think he has PCs on BOTH, I'm on Ro).  No idea if he is guilded or
not, either, so no help there :)
