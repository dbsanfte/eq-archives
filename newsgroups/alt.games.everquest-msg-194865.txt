Nice ratio, but even more important to Roguelings it has a high
base damage (12?), and Backstab damage considers onyl base damage,
delay is irrelevant (used to see a lot of Rogues swapping in a
high damage piercer when BS cycled).

My Druid on FV started hunting wisps via porcupine method just as
soon as he made L9.  With Flame Lick (baby DoT) and 5pts worth of
DS, heal self during "fight", and nuke the wisp down when it turned
(often had to med for the last nuke or two).  Got lucky on GLSs
and bought a Combine Warhammer before making L10.
