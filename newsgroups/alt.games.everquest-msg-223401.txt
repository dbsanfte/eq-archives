It's handy if you're in the bazaar in Trader mode, or if AFK at length; if a
guildie or propsective buyer tells you in the night, you've got it right
there when you come back.  I haven't tried it while advertising ports; seems
it'd be handy there, too, provided I could stack 'em somewhere.  I keep the
option off rest of the time.

And Lance, check your eqclient.ini; I think you can twiddle with the default
size and placement of the box when it pops up.  I think.
