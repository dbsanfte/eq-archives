I had a small windfall in the bazaar yesterday, and I find myself with 
about 15k to spend (which, pathetically enough, happens to be the most 
cash-in-hand I've ever had). Since most of the spells that I haven't 
bought yet are "convenience" ones, like group versions of buffs and the 
like, I was thinking of spending the money on equipment instead. Some of 
those ceramic Focus items are beginning to fall into the range I can 
afford, but no the truly useful ones like Improved Healing IV or Spell 
Haste IV... On the other hand, droppable FT items seem to start at 50k+ 
if you are lucky.

Any Druids out there have any ideas, or should I maybe keep on saving 
for something in the 20-30k range? If I get any more money that that, 
I'll just buy a Fungi tunic and twink a monk instead ;)
