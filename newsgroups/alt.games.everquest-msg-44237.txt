Copy from my history page on our website:

Found by a childless dwarven couple Rhand was raised by dwarfs. His
childhood was harsh for he outgrew his playmates in a few years. Toying with
magics unknown to other dwarfs he became an outcast, yet still loved by the
small mountain community.

In a dark period his town-cave was raided by goblins. To help with whatever
he could, Rhand summoned a fiery defender to protect his town.

The raiders were defeated succesfully, but Rhand's inexperience and lack of
tutorship made him lose control of the awesome elemental. Instead of
returning whence it came from it released havoc on the town itself, killing
both Rhand's adoption-parents as well as half of the survivors of the raid.

Vowing to become a master of his powers and defeating evil in the lands
Rhand left his home town.

After many ferocious battles a noble paladin approached Rhand and invited
him to join his noble cause. Palli, the name of the Paladin, was leader of
the guild named Destiny's Shadow.

After a few good years the guild broke apart in a time of great turmoil.
Rhand took over leadership and pieced the remnants together to forge an ever
stronger guild.
