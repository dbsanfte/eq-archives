You could easily go five or more levels, as a Druid, hunting stuff that 
on average drops *NOTHING*, with perhaps the odd 1gp drop every tenth 
kill or so. Of course, if you wanted specifically to pharm cash, you can 
do it with a Druid, although it's nowhere near as efficient as with a 
melee, but cash in the course of normal XP'ing is very poor indeed.
