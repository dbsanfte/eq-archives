Aggro aside, I prided my bard's tanking abilities until the mid 30's when 
I noticed many more mobs were able to beat the crap out of me than 
before. At that point I had to seriously consider putting the weapons 
away for many fights and looking into instrument swapping, which changed 
my experience dramatically. I will say that the MR song is *incredible* 
with a decent drum.
