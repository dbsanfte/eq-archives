I'm not seeing this very much on Antonia Bayle (on the Freeport side, I just
hit 16 and started the betrayal quest, so I'll know about Qeynos soon). 
There are certainly idiots and inconsiderate players, but the majority of
groups I've been in have been willing to help each other out, and to help
each other get quest items rather than dropping when they have what they need.

I strongly prefer to group, which is why I play an Enchanter.  Most of my
guild has outlevelled me by a long shot, so I spend the majority of my time in
pickup groups.  So far I've had only a few times where the group just didn't
work and I had to leave.  Dozens of groups have been fun, friendly, helpful
people.  

The community feeling is certainly less than I found in EQ1.  The groups last
for shorter periods, and there's almost no interaction between groups (no
drive-by buffs, no "/ooc <thingy> to first taker in <campname>".

I'd argue that this is a failing of the vendor system, not the tradeskill
system.  Having to be online and inactive to sell things really bites.  I'm
not a bit tradeskiller, though, so I'll take your word on it.

Possibly just a random idiot, I doubt there's any game that's free from them.
If this is the norm, I recommend trying a different server.  It's not that way
everywhere.

Really?  Groups I've found are very death-averse.  After a wipe, it takes
effort to get them to try again sometimes, unless we can add a person or
something.

Ahh, I see, maybe.  If you're looking for short-term helpers for quests
you're on, you get offended that you're treated as a short-term helper
for quests your groupmates are on?

If you plan to spend a few hours in a zone, and don't really care what you
kill, you may find better groups.  Or maybe not - perhaps I've just been
lucky.

>So my question is, does WoW have similar problems? 

I'd love to hear reports of WoW as well, from people who prefer to spend hours
in a pickup group over soloing and running back and forth for dumb "find X,
Kill Y" quests.  From what I can tell, the community aspect is rather less
than EQ2.
