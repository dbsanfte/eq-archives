hi, it sounds like you are a lower lev char, if you are not i am not trying
to be offensive, but anyhow. the penalty as you gain levels does increase,
also though the amount of deaths should decrease if ya die 5 times every
level when you get to higher levs you might wana reconsider your play style.
don t get me wrong though there will be levs that you are just gonna die and
die and the reprecussions for death you will see are harsh!! i had 1 such
level when i was lev 30 i was stuck there for a few months, because of
diing. also the levels after hell levels have a greater exp penalties then
the other levs
