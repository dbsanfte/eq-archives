On EMarr, I see a bunch of high level bards in OS.. well not a bunch, 2 or
3. I usually dont pay much attention to who is in the zone unless I'm
grouped with them or I know them
I have also seen 3 different bards with their epics on my server, and that
was a few months back... I am also in a guild with a 59 cleric that has a 50
bard. he might be 51 by now
