There's a big difference between a new player and new character. I can't
stop newbies from taking time out to loot bats and rats.

Even for an experienced player, 1-17 in an hour seems a bit high. Time it
takes to get from your spawn point to an area where you can get to level 17
usually means quite a bit of that time is taken up just by zoning. It also
means you didn't take out time to train with your guildmaster for things
like dodge or meditate or whatever else would be nice to have at level 17.
If you twink them, it usually means 20 minutes of running to a bank and
trying stuff on.

Even the time spent at the bazaar shopping and twinking should really be
thrown into the equation too along with just how much pp was spent.

Let's say you average ~2 blues per kill going 1-17. That means 2.5 kills per
yellow, 12.5 kills per level, 212 kills in an hour. Other then the fact it
is hard to find an area with 212 things to kill in an hour, that means at
any one time you are having ~3-4 things beating on your twinkie with little
or no down time.
