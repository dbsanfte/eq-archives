Isn't it funny that among all these people posting in this thread,
"Thomas Houseman" (thread initiator) and "Mary Poppins" are the only
posters with aliases that have never posted to any other thread, let
alone any other newsgroup?  It's almost as if the aliases were created
solely for posting to this thread.  You don't think someone created one
or both of these just so that they could post a rant on SoE do you?

mary.poppins@blizzard.com???

Nahhhhh.  But I do think that the person who fits the profile the best
really shouldn't be casting around such allegations. :)
