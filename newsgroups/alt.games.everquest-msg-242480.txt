If you are going to die, make sure you bring a cleric with you, is my motto
:P I may have a slanted view as my bro is a cleric and usually rez's me if I
die to something stupid I tried solo.  No I cant solo guardian wurms yet, or
at least havent figured out how to (self buffed, only tried once) :)) .  Bet
my 58 shaman could though (but he cant solo cliff golem yet :D):/

Did solo Tantor though, was unsnared till he was at 40%...
