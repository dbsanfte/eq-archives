While it may be true that some druids ask for money for ports I have been
given free ports on numerous occasions. Most will outright refuse the money
I offer them! Druids are probably the most generous class out there. I
cannot count the number of times I have been given SOWs and ports.

What is so wrong with asking for his share of the gem drops? Obviously the
druid was doing their share of the work or you would have punted him from
group. Why don't you grow up and learn to share? Yeesh! Are you 8 years old?
Why don't you take your toys and go home?
