I got to level 60 (mostly grouped) and even participated on raids
while I was playing 3-4 hours a night. The current grouping situation
is a bit different, with everyone tucked away in LDoN you'd have to
calculate time to spare for that, but elsewhere it is usually okay to
stay as little as an hour or so. Just give a heads up before your time
runs out so they have time to look for a replacement if they need one.
