You're using 800x600 on a 19" monitor, and having trouble reading the text
in windowed mode unless you let it switch resolutions?

Hmmm....  I honestly thought you must be using a 15" monitor, which is why I
mentioned something about a larger monitor.

I'm using 1024x768 mode on a 19" monitor and have no trouble reading the
text in windowed mode (without switching resolutions, so the windowed
display is smaller than the screen).  And I also used 1024x768 mode on my
old system with a 17" monitor; sometimes I had to lean closer to the screen
to read text, but that was because I usually play leaning back in my chair
away from the monitor.


Just thought of something: for my 19" monitor, the optimum resolutions are
1024x768 and 1280x1024.  If your monitor has similar specs, using the
800x600 mode could be costing you some sharpness.

Something else that can reduce the display sharpness is using too high a
refresh rate.  Generally, you want the lowest rate that doesn't cause any
flickering.  To check for screen flicker, don't stare straight at the
screen; instead, look off to the side: your peripheral vision is a lot more
sensitive to flicker.

I switched to full-screen mode within hours of first starting to play EQ.
Now, I can't even imagine actually trying to play in windowed mode; for me,
it would be extreme torture.

Note: if you check the keyboard part of the options, you'll discover that
some of the newer shortcuts in there are handy for managing your full-screen
display.

One that's handy is <alt-L>; that locks or unlocks the size and position of
the on-screen boxes.  Unlock when you want to rearrange or resize the boxes,
then lock it again so you don't wind up dragging one of your boxes all over
the screen because you clicked on the wrong place.

Another one is <alt-M>, which toggles on or off the panel with the menu
buttons from the right hand side of the windowed mode display; useful for
setting up new hot keys, etc. without having to switch to windowed mode.
