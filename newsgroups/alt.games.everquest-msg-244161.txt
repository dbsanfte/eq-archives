I have been seriously considering the new Nostromo as well. Can you give 
me some specifics on what you don't like or what isn't working for you? I 
had the Thrustmaster Tacticalboard a while back. It should have been 
perfect, especially for my bard, but while the button layout was more 
comprehensive, the button configuration and macro software was lacking to 
the point of rendering it impractical.
