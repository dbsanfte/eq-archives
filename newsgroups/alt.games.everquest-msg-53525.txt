Oh bullshit, you didn't come here for answers, you came here to rant.
Re-read your own post.  You asked one little question at the end (at least,
I assume it was a question, perhaps you only know what exclamation marks are
and haven't gotten as far as question marks?) but the rest was pure rant.

Get over yourself.  Post a rant and expect abuse.  If you don't want abuse
don't post anti-EQ rants on an EQ group.
