My fiancee both have high level druids which are not overly group/pair
friendly. I am wanting to start a pair which can group off of each other
very well and was considering rogue/necro combo. The thoughts behind it are
she fears/dots it and while it's running i come behind it and bs it. Anyone
have any thoughts about good pairing classes. We considered shaman monk
combo but neither of us have the desire to play a shaman. I have enough int
and mana gear to twink her sufficiently as well as an iksar regen bp and can
cough up myro gear easy enough or other twink rogue stuff.
Thanks in advance
