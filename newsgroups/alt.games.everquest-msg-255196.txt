Don't know why you thought it was "made ok".  I was making fun of you.  =P

"Allows tweaking of the actual world rendering rate so that the interface
still works and responds at full speed, but the display of the actual world
updates less (NOTE: If render limiting is on, the display will "flicker", so
this is only good for background windows). Rendering the world takes
approximately 50% of the CPU time used every frame (MMOTools Subscribers
only)"

Or, you could set the background framerate down, as you suggest, and forget
about using autofollow (something a lot of 2-boxers rely on often).

I.E., "for the functionality being discussed, you have to pay."

Here's my assholish smiley again!  =P
