And changed it back about 2 months ago.

We're in essentially a similar situation to the OP.   Grog was our server GM
for years. Over that time he gained a lot of respect, and a reputation for
fairness among pretty much everyone that wasn't a total asshat.  He has
since been replaced by a random, facesss GM, who appears out of nowhere to
spam LOE advertisements, then disappears back to the same place.
