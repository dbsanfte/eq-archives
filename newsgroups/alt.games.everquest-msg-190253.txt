Well, I used the customer service email on the EQ website,explaining my
problem.I received the following  about 4 days afterward:

Greetings Dan,

    Thank you for contacting Sony Online Entertainment's Customer Service
department.

I've looked for your missing items and was able to locate them.  I have
placed them back onto your character, you should see them the next time you
log on.  Hopefully everything is ok now!  I apologize for any delays in
getting this matter resolved.

If you have any further questions please feel free to contact me and let me
know.  Safe travels!

Regards,

Justin Allen

the
results..  :-)
