Thought I'd ask for some help with EQ lag.
All thoughts welcome - I run EQ on a PIII 450 MHz - 196 MB RAM without
Luclin. For the past two weeks I have been suffering from
non-connection-related lag. I do have broadband, and the lag happens at
certain, known times, for which I cannot see an obvious connection (.
1- EQ Storms screw the hell out of me - It basically hangs for a couple of
seconds. It has cost the life of a fellow player, as I was healing him and
then, boom thunder, and the computer hangs for 3-4 seconds, making one of
these electronic, terrible noises. Next thing I know, he's dead.
2- Minor lags happen when I stand up ! 1/2 second, but still happening.
3- The worst lags I witnessed are usually at the start of fights - it hangs
for about 5 seconds, which are essential.

I have tried to switch off spell effects, reduced fight spam as much as
possible, it still happens.

Somehow I have an inkling that this is sound related - any suggestion ?
Music is not turned on, only the basic settings are on, etc... can you turn
off the sound ?

Also, might be related - when listening to mp3s (not playing EQ), I do
notice the music "hanging" for half a second at times - with that terrible
noise - Could the soundcard (a basic Creative Soundblaster) be at the origin
of the problem ?

This is starting to drive me nuts !
Thx for your help in advance !
