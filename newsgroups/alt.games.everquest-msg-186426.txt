/agree

I'd been solid as a rock for months.  I started having problems CTD and
VXD crashes on the first loy pre-patch like mad (I'd never had a VXD
crash in 5 years of EQ before, about 2 years now on the same machine),
they have been slowly getting better, and I haven't had a VXD crash for
at least a week now (was every day right after first pre-patch).  I
assume they are finding what they broke and fixing it.
