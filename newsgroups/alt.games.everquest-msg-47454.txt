In some of the games out there, the gaming culture is pretty harsh and
unforgiving toward newbies.

EQ is not that way.  Act civil, avoid using abbreviations when 'talking' to
people (it is the trade mark in the game of the 'l33t d00dz'....the utter
jackasses), don't beg for stuff (despite the fact the game manual says it's
acceptable, it isn't), work hard, don't steal other people's kills, and you
should do just fine.  Unless you start begging, kill stealing, or doing
other socially unacceptable acts, you should have few or no problems from
the more experienced players.
