Yup, if I drive-by buff you or drive-by give you something because I'm being
nice...getting a "thx" or "ty" translates to, "yeah, sure, ok, nice
buff...go away now."

"thanks" or "thank you" means "I didn't really need it, but I appreciate the
gesture."
"thanks!" or "thank you!" means the receiver appreciated a lot more than
just the gesture.  This is the only one I really enjoy hearing.
