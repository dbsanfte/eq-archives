Bill Diamond answered your question.  You don't have to convert the file
system, though, and once you do, I don't believe there's any way to convert
back to FAT32 besides doing FDISK (though maybe a simple real format would
do it...it's Monday so my brain isn't up to speed yet, and I've never had to
go from NTFS to FAT32).
