I prefer to use the W A S D keys instead of the arrow keys to move
about. But a problem has arisen that is causing my huge headaches.

Many times an active cursor appears in the chat window and when I use
my WASD keys I obviously don't go anywhere but instead fill the chat
window with whatever key I'm pressing (WASD). This has caused needless
deaths and much frustration. I know I can reverse back to the arrow
keys but I would much rather use the WASD keys.

Also, changing to a different chat window does not eliminate the
problem.

Thanks
Zebuxoruk.
