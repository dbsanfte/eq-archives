Spirit of Wolf, also known as SoW or sow, is not a paladin castable 
spell.  You'll have to beg for it or group with someone who has it, 
druids and shamans both have it at low levels, 9 for both I believe.
Go to eq.crgaming.com and look up your class and all the spells, that 
site will also give you some help finding where to buy it.  The listings 
there don't include Plane of Knowledge, if you have Planes of Power 
expansion, your low level spells are most probably there in addition to 
where Caster's realm say.

Misty acorns are useful, don't let them go cheaply.  If you have Luclin 
expansion, go to the bazaar and see what other players are selling them for.

Good luck
