<<<<<<<<He thinks that because many of us feel that KEI at low levels is 
overpowered that it also means that we believe that any mana regen spells 
are not useful as anything but a crutch.  Personally I am always happy to 
get a level appropriate mana regen or multiple mana regen spells cast on 
me.  I still regen my mana with canni/heal even then, means I can 
accomplish more in less time.>>>>>>>>>

You can accomplish more in less time?  Why would you want to do that?  You
should be talking with all your friends or working on tradeskills or something.
 Don't miss out on the social aspects of the game.  If you accomplish more in
less time it means that you'll be done playing the game sooner and SOE isn't
gonna like that.  They'll "fix" the mana regen spells and probably your canni
too.  They're really an exploit after all and a crutch especially at lower
levels.  

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<  Oh, and if he is to be believed, he quite 
EQ over the KEI change, but he still trolls here for some reason, guess 
he gets his jollies out of people pointing out what a clueless idiot he 
is.
