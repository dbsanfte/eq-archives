Drake,

Most of your posts these days are useful, and generally you come across
as a reasonably intelligent kind of guy, but is your action here any
less pathetic that what you are accusing others of ?

The fact that your accusations are total BS is another matter entirely,
but if you expect other people to stop defending people from the type of
unwarranted crap like that which you spew above, then here is a hint :
stop posting it.

For the record, I would rather read Biz post his (mostly) on-target
rants than read your fanatical and personal hate mail. 

Still that just my 2 pence,

Jim
