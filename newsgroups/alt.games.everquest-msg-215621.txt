There's mana song, and then there's juggling mana song;

Playing just mana (or better, cantata) is a matter of turn it on leave it on,
very simple and restful.  You can go AFK for an hour on autofollow and be
playing any one song the whole time.

But its possible to put out more mana than that.  Cantata is a standard three
tic song, so you can sing it and other songs in a normal twist.  Even at high
levels when you have more than one cantata, you can't stack them (nor can you
stack the original of the line, Hymn, which has no mana component, just the HP
regen).

But the other line of mana songs is a "pulse" song, which gives mana at the
instant of completion only.  Its possible to leave that one run, in which case
you get one pulse per tic.  Or you can force feed it, which can give you 4 or
even 5 pulses during the same time frame as a normal song duration, but now you
are constantly on the job, stopping and restarting the song every time it
pulses.

The pulse mana stacks with Cantata mana, though, so you can get even more mana
out by twisting Cantata, mana, mana, mana, Cantata.

Oh but wait, there's Amplification.  Manasong is a voice based song, which means
that normal instruments don't help (a couple do, including the epic); thats a
relief because cantata requires a string instrument, and so you'd have to
"juggle" (swap weapons and instruments around in time with your various
songs)... but Amplification, a 9 tic duration song, dramatically improves the
output mana per pulse.  So you can sing Amp, mana mana mana mana mana mana mana
mana, Amp (and so on) in order to get more out of manasong.

But thats not enough, no, you can combine both methods for your ultimate mana
output: Cantata, Amp, Mana, Mana, Cantata, Mana mana mana Cantata Mana, Mana,
Mana, repeat

This ultimate mana twist is good to know, in case you need to wring every ounce
of mana flow out in order to break a camp, or because someone just got a rez, or
because an overpull required people to burn out lots more mana than usual.
Doing it for the occaisional long recovery isn't a big deal, and it can go a
long way towards cementing your reputation as a superbard, "ordinary" bards
won't even have heard of this little feat.

Using this flat out full bore mana production twist during down time means no
rest at all for your poor wrists, and its 9 beat cycle requires even more
attention than a standard twist, any bard who's called on to do this during all
the down times for an extended period is going above and beyond the call of
duty.  If mana regen is needed that badly, then the natural conclusion is that
the casters should have got a KEI, which would stack with bard mana, and
probably permit the bard to strum cantata and take his hands off the keyboard
for a few seconds.

I'd hate to think that level 55 adventures on normal were designed to require
the casting of a hard to get level 60 spell.  Wouldn't be surprised, but I'd
hate to think it.
