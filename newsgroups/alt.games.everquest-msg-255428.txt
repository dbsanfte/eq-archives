Something that takes 2 months to complete, is not a 'farm' in my books.

'helping' no. But involved? why not? Isn't that what 'Legends' is all 
about...or supposed to be about. The 'premium everquest', as it were.

Been a while, but yeah, that sounds right. Most of the Silmarillion 
focused on Morgoth over Sauron...

RPGs are about heroes, not pawns.

I suppose if we back away from EQ, and come right out and say 'this is 
not an rpg do not play this game if you want to play an rpg' then 
yeah... EQ is fine as is.

But then there is a gaping hole in the market for an "mm-R-P-G" that is 
waiting to be filled =)
