lol, I got really bored yesterday, and checked my list of alts, and 
noted that if I changed my bazaar mule from a dorf cleric to a warrior, 
and changed my second SK to a pally, and made the empty slot a wizard I 
would have one of every class in my 2 accounts...so the first thing I 
did when I finally could get into the game this morning was do it=)

What I have normally been doing is playing a different under 30 alt in 
the morning before my normal partner gets online, then we play our 
mains. I figure it will take a fair amount of time leveling 10 alts to 
30, and the alts over 30 are going to wait until our mains hit 60, then 
I will start playing them until they hit 60=)Then I will work on getting 
the alts up to 60=)
