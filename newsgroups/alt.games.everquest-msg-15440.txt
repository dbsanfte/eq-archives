This is a MMORPG.   I solo my Bard while waiting for a group
which is normally little or no time.  I play a Necro too,
and even though I can solo him constantly and not group at
all, I still ooc for groups or a partner.  The reason I
myself started a Bard was for the classes very group
friendly nature.

That being said I COMPLETELY agree with you on the solo
guide thing.  Every solo guide I found for the Bard was
terrible.  The running in circles thing is kitiing and it
does take a Bard longer than a Druid or Wizard to do it.  A
lot longer.  But I was quad kitiing at level 12 or 14 (not
sure which).  Haven't played Dr00d or Wiz, but my Necro
could not do that, certainly with NO down time at all.
