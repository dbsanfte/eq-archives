Actually, patches are generally scheduled to start at around the same
time, every time. Usually 3am PST, but can be +/- 3 hours depending on
the size of the patch. I'm guessing that would account for the vast
majority of non-emergency patches.

That does hit the same people every time, but the problem is, the number
of people it hits is a minority. They could vary the patch times, in
fact, it would probably suit them to start patches at 9am PST, but that
would inconvenience more people.

Patches are so often scheduled at the same time, that VI actually went
to the trouble of adding specific game code to combat the fact that the
same time zone was getting too much benefit from server respawns. They
added a random timer to each high end, long respawn mob. I sincerely
doubt that if everyone was getting : "more than your fair share of
'equal treatment' " they would've gone to the trouble. A majority was
complaining about a minority getting an advantage, so changes were made.
A minority complains about a disadvantage, and nothing is done. It may
not be 'nice' or 'fair', but it's certainly business.
