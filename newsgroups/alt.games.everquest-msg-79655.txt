I have heard a lot about people having problems with going link dead and
crashing out. I have been playing for about a month now and have been
disconnected maybe 3 times.

While I do understand that people's problems may be Verants but I am curious
how much of the problem lies with your ISP and your own computer. I am
running a new machine with a very reliable ISP. I never go link dead and
maintain a good connection when zoning. Sure it lags in certain places but I
think these areas are common to everyone.

Just my 2 cents.
