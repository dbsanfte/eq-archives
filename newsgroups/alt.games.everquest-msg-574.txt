Etiquette as it applies in this newsgroup is a difficult target to
hit, to put it mildly.

As a long-time participant, *I* have no problem with such sales
notices appearing here. I don't know what kind of success rate you'll
see, though - it is my impression that this isn't a good place for
selling items, mostly because people don't really come here looking
for sale items.

I'd recommend you find the web site for your server. Many servers
seems to have a non-official but highly utilized web site where sales
posts are more successful. Also, don't discount the big sites for
auctions - Allakhazams comes to mind, and no doubt there are countless
others.

Taras Bulbas is working on the first ever FAQ for this newsgroup.
There's a thread on the subject - feel free to jump in an offer your
opinions as what *you* think should be included.
