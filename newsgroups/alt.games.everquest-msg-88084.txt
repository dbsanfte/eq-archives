Here goes my best 4 person group.

Necro
Druid
Cleric
Bard

The necro and druid make the best combo EVER you just need to give
them a good supporting class.  All except for the cleric can solo
until 60 so you can all play if you can't get on  at the same time.

The only reason you add a cleric is for lag deaths, but sense they are
in the group have them use spells like stun, DD and even fear.  Most
people fail to realize the value of stuns when reverse kiting.  Why?

Bards are there for everything you want an enchanter AND shaman for.
Clarity (which is better than enchanters when twisted), charm and
mezz.  They can also do a little tanking, haste and slow if needed.
Plus you have that cleric to heal him.

There should never be any down time with this group.  Never ever.

If you want to go to a dungeon just do a /shout looking for stupid pet
warrior to take a beating and go away when done.  If you want to add
another for outside look for a rouge or Mag.
