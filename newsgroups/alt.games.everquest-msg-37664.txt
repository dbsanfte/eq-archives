    Honestly, I think it's the brand new "feature". Question: how can you
make a quest take every player that wants to do it a long time, making it
"epic" in some way? Answer: force them to complete it over the course of
several levels. The Crystallized Shadow Weapon quest in Stonebrunt is a
great example of this - you have to kill the spiritlings at low level before
they green, and you're nowhere near ready to go to ToFS at that point. So
you HAVE to delay completion of the quest.

    But yeah, last night in SB was frustrating for a lot of people. They
came to the zone hoping to at least do the quests, and were locked out. The
shouts of frustration were rampant last night. Then add in how poor the
hunting will likely be, and I imagine they just made a zone where the
Snowbeast will be camped, and not much else.

    To elaborate on the hunting: to get there, one must get through the King
room in The Warrens, and out the back of the dungeon. Many classes will be
unable to do this solo, period. And once the classes that CAN do it solo get
into SB, they'll find a zone where half the hunting near zone was in camps
that cannot be soloed, and the other half is the usual mixed bag of mobs
with mobs blue to a level 42 wandering in the same spots as rabbits and
spiritlings. No hunting unless you bring a group - which excludes most of
the people in the damn game.

    Those shouldn't be too hard to get, actually. Snowbeast is up a lot,
from what I saw. (Could be nerfed later, we'll see.) He was reported to be
blue to a 55, and blue to a 41, making him level 40 dead on. So anyone up to
55 can hunt him - your guild should have someone 55 or less that can go farm
him. He apparently also can be talked to, but I doubt he'll be up more than
ten seconds before dying after seeing the stats on the Footpads of the
Tiger.

    And farmers will love Snowbeast....

    Other tidbits from the zone: I completed one quest and heard the results
of a second last night. The one I completed was Miranda's lost bag of dice,
which drops in The Warrens off a level 18 mob (Lore, No Drop). The result
was an all/all, zero weight, No Drop Ball of Yarn with 4 charges of snare,
casting time 5 seconds or so. Since the character that I had in the area was
level 42 and unable to get the bag of dice herself, I had my rogue kill
every mob between Prince and Foodmaster/Smithy, brought a level 15 monk
friend down, and we killed Prince like that while I looted the dice. I took
the HT,  the monk was buffed and healed during combat by a level 40 druid
friend. Yay, Warrens loot code.

    The other quest done was the "kill the named kobold" quest. Apparently
after killing a level 37 kobold the reward is a 6/24 one hander with 5 HPs
and AC 2. Blech.

    Oh, and I haven't mentioned the broken scripting yet! Talk to Miranda, a
little kitty, and she mentions how one of the elders gave her Chocolate
Covered Cherries and Pixie Powder Cinnesticks. Well, even though Cinnamon
Sticks have been unforagable since the patch that put Morning Dew on the
forage table in GFay, I figured I'd still like to know the new recipes. So I
asked the named elder about those two items. Both prompted her to tell me
the sad tale of her people, just like her normal [bracket-encased text] did.
BAH!
