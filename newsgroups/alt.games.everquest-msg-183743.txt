I've been there with a druid.  I've fought right alongside a ranger there,
as a matter of fact.  But when he ran off to scout and pull, I stayed in the
rear with the gear ... so I know exactly bupkus about being a ranger in the
planes.

I can speak fluent druid on the subject, though ...

Forgot to mention that in my excitement over the prospect of finally
quadding, I'd forgotten to re-bind myself ... a fact I remembered as soon as
I saw LOADING, PLEASE WAIT.

Fortunately, even a naked druid can port to Butcherblock easily enough.
