> If your enchanter dies regularly, it's not the classes fault.

I think he was trying to imply that while enchanter may be an awesome
soloer,
it is leaps and bounds more dangerous than any of the other classses he
mentioned.

Lack of snaring, self healing, sow (this one can be solved though), means
that things can
go bad real fast.

Now, a great enchanter soloist, wont die very often, but if that same player
also solos with druid/bard/etc guess which one has racked up the most solo
deaths.
