I understand that point. But isn't that pretty self-correcting?
Or, another view *might* be that if what you're making is
regularly sold at cost by those using that item for skillups
only to find something else to sell for profit?

I'm not in the high end of any tradeskill yet. Nothing is
over 200, though the majority of them are in the 100 to 199
range. Right now, the only item I can think of that I'm
skilling up on that I'm also selling in the bazaar are
arrows. I'm selling them for under cost (I think) but for
more than what vendors buy them for. If I'm screwing up
someone's profits, I'm sorry about that, but at the rate
my arrows sell, I'm not so sure they're good profit-
making items anyway.

Yah, I understand that as much as I can understand it while
not living it. :)

True.
