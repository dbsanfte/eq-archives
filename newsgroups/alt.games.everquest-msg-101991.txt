Sorry to disappoint you, but his girlfriend's a chef. She makes yummy
dinners too, I dined at their place just last week. No liver in sight
either! ^_^ Hmm, but most of the time we get by on pizza and other
takeaway meals, so the offer *is* tempting...

I think she's getting tired of me hanging out there, though. Not a lot
of Quality Time when her boyfriend's off slaying vile beasts all the
time... But whenever I suggest we take a break, he's all gung ho to
play more!

Ah, might your field of interest and education be something that
warrants its own department at universities, but not many "real"
jobs, like philosophy? Or is it something that was in high demand
when you started, and a dead job market now?  Still, what matters
is that you chose to pursue something that interests you.

Hmm, new computer or DSL first? Get DSL, you'll save money for the
computer fast then! Well, your expenses aren't all that high, so if
your computer is real old, maybe replace that first...

Speaking of large phone bills, one guy who used to play the game and
got quarterly phone bills once got a NOK 12000 bill. He quit Real Soon
after that...

For our international audience: NOK 12000 is, unless the dollar has
become even stronger since the last time I checked, more than $1200.
For 3 months of Everquest.

I'm beginning to wonder if the name generation filters and GMs have
been instructed to specifically allow him to make stupid names. He
changed this one without any prompting though, realized it was stupid
after a couple hours, so there's hope for him still. Although the
name he changed to is an international trade mark... I'll not reveal
that though, don't want any AB'ers to petition him in case they hate
my guts or anything.

I know a few players on AB who are not too far away from you, for
large values of "not too far away". If I remember your general
location correctly, at least. Ok, very large values of "not too
far away", then.

And where I live (A small town by any standard, ~5k inhabitants),
I know of six who play, and a couple who used to. Bet there's more
I don't know of though.

Rune, my condolences on the passing of your canine companion.
