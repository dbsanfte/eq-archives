That is too funny.

I do something similar to up my cleric's "begging" skill.

Go to any newbie garden and give a green MOB a copper.

If you just start begging, after a while, the MOB will wander away, making it
hard for you to continue begging.


So, you just arrgo him, he will whack on you, staying put while he does it, you
beg away.

Takes a while to up begging skill this way, any where from two begs to over 72
to up a skill point, but it works.

Also, after a while of bashing on you, and not really doing any damage, the MOB
will wander off, totally humiliated that it couldn't really hurt you. So, you
just arrgo him again, like with a Hand to Hand swipe at him (so you don't kill
him), then he stays put for a while so you can beg some more. :))

I upped my begging skill on a Saturday morning a while back, about 25 points in
about 90 minutes. Yes, it was boring and I couldn't move my mouse hand for hours
after that, hehe. But, it worked.
