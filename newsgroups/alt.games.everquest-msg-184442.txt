That is at least one problem you avoid with points.

Well, I know the feeling myself, I get it every time we kill Feshlak
and he doesn't have boots for me :) (He dropped them the first kill I
was present for, but I got outbid. I slept for the previous Feshlak
kill, during which boots dropped and were won by a beastlord for a
song and a dance) It's when you want something, know it is within your
grasp, but it never materializes. I think everyone has a bit of that.

In contrast, how do you think druids and shamans in your guild feel
about being passed over for their godly shield and whatever other
priest class loot defaults to cleric, every single time? Us non plate
wearers don't need AC, or hps, or ft? You bet your sweet ass that if
we ever go there, I'll be bidding against clerics for that shield.

(Yes, I'm annoyed at how for instance Shield of Dragonkind and Shield
of Thorns compare, and how most druid loot is all/all or clr/dru/shm,
which becomes translated to clr only by many people. Sue me :p )
