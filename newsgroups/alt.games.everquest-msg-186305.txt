Helping to pick nits...

In my Velk-hunting days, I jumped off the very highest ledge of the "upper
spiders" camp many times as my quick way to the floor.  I've also seen a
monk take that same jump and 10k.

I can jump off the valley ledge to Kael in EW and not 10k on one computer,
but on my other computer it's a guaranteed 10k.

Not exactly consistent ("consistent"), as CPU/video/lag obviously have some
impact.
