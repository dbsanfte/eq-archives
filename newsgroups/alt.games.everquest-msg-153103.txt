Another reason they should increase drop rates if you are forced to wait
until another time.

Right...I was meaning within the raid/battle area.

No you would still be able to try, you'd just have some of your aggro
remembered, causing a slight increase in damage (5-10% maybe?).  If you
waited long enough, then that % would be dropped.  Maybe have it drop over
time until it finally reaches 0%.

Yes.  Again not zone wide, just room wide.  But I still do mean to port to
another random zone, & even random location within that zone.

Again like the failed attempt issue.  Just increase by small percentage the
damage inflicted on you.  In this case less than someone who was actually
involved in the attempted or successful killing.
