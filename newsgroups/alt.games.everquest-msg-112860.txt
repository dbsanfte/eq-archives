Ok first off check your IRQ resources. Durring POST (when you first
power up) you should see a list of devices and the IRQs they are
using. Make sure your network card (or modem) has it's own IRQ, and is
not sharing with another device. If there is a conflict, you may have
to shuffle your PCI cards around in different slots until you find the
right combination. You do NOT want Video, Sound, or Networking sharing
an IRQ.
