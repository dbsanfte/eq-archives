The Shaman pet must cost a ton of mana to summon.  I can recall getting
pissed as hell at a Shaman who was so damned obsessed with saving his
fucking pet that I died.  He, of course, gated out, and the SK with us
managed to feign with under 150hp left (we were low-/mid-fifties).  I
never did happen to group with that particular Shaman again.
