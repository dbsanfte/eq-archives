Nah, you are paying 40 bucks for a SERVICE on the legends server. You
are paying 40 bucks for the EQ the rest of us would like to play. This
just seperates the have's from the have not's even more, paying 40
bucks for the EQ we want to play and the EQ2 we REALLY want to play. 

EQ2 is set up to NOT need the CS attention you pay for on the Legends
server and is more dynamic out of the gate to boot. Anyone with the 40
bucks to spend on ye old EQ would certainly have the computer for EQ2.
My prediction is that Legends will be the first EQ1 server to die.
