 The point being, there wont be enough zones to support the people that
can't XP anywhere else because the level limit is too narrow. The few
zones that are open to everyone are ridiculous with the amount of people
and trains in them. Even the flagged zones such as PoV are crowded and
you can be LFG all day and not get a spot.

 So yeah, of course they will go to them. A lot of good overcrowded
zones are going to do them though. Luckily we've pushed past those areas
and have moved into Halls of Honor. Hopefully we'll be out of there
before druids and wizards 'tag along' on Aerin'Dar raids and get
themselves flagged so they can try soloing in there.
