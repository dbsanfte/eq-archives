First off If your a druid you can "BIND AFFINITY" yourself in Dl and gate 
back.

Second off if your a druid that is truely high enough level to be in DL you 
also have "TRACK". So It should be easy to find him.

If you dont Like to be bothered there is also this thing Known as 
"/ROLEPLAY",  Which makes it impossible for them to know you are a druid at 
all unless thewy are are right there with you which negates the finding them 
part all together.

My suggestion is to just delete the druid since obviously you dont like the 
fact that part of the druids job, is TAXI service.  And Just like all 
services there should be a charge.

Not to mention the fact that you could just as easily have replied "Im sorry 
but I am busy right now so I can not port you.  Maybe someone else can give 
you a ride."
