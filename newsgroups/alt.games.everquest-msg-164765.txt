Ideally, these "bonuses" are offset by some sort of severe limitations.

Dwarves might be sturdy but incapable of magic.
Elves could be highly magical but frail.
Or in a different venue, Vulcans are smart, strong, and have limited PSI,
but are incapable of intuition or emotional attachment -making them lousy
leaders.

Unfortunately, EQ classes are kind of shallow, so for the most part if
you're heavy in one stat, the rest matter very little. What should be sever
limitations become minor annoyances.

And on a totally unrelated rant, where they got the idea that Halflings are
supposed to be exceptionally wise, I do not know. I always envisioned
Halflings as being sneaky, cowardly little hedonists, wanting mostly to
sleep, eat, steal, and be left alone. The optimal class for Halflings ought
to be Rogue, not Druid.
