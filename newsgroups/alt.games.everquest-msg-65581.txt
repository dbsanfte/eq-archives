They big problem with Tom's is that it greatly blows negligible
differences way out of proportion.  E.g., I seem to recall that on a
recent motherboard chipset review, they were saying some new chip
blows the old ones away.  Yet, if you looked at all the benchmark
results, the tests fell into three categories:

1. There were about 5 motherboards with the new chips that scored,
say, 100.5 in the benchmarks.  The two with the old chips scored 100.
And then there were 5 or so with the new chips that scored 99.5.  Most
of the tests were like this.

2. There were one or two tests where the old chips were at the bottom.
Range was similar to the above (e.g., about 1% difference between best
and worst).

3. There were two or three tests where the old chips were at the top.
Again, difference between best and worst was about 1%.

Rational conclusion: there is no noticable difference in performance
between the old and new chips, and no noticable performance difference
between different vendor's implementations using the new chips.  Buy
whichever is best for you on price, features, quality, etc.

Tom's conclusion: the new chips completely blow away the old, and the
particular vendor whose board tended to be at the top of that 1%
variation is the clear choice.

On the plus side, Tom's *DOES* give you the data, so you can look at
the charts yourself and make your own decision.  This is much better
than some reviews do, and Tom's is an invaluable site.
