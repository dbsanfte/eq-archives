	I would say that your conclusion does not follow logically from
your premise.

	I would also say that your conclusion in no way negates the basic
point.  There are things which are "facts."  There are things which are
"not facts."  "Speculation" falls clearly and unequivocably into the "not
facts" category.



>and conversely, facts can be twisted just like statistics...

	Again, this in no way negates the basic point.

	I can certainly see how you would feel this way.

	This is what we call an "ad hominem" argument.	Here's how
Merriam-Webster defines "ad hominem" at http://www.m-w.com:

1 : appealing to feelings or prejudices rather than intellect
2 : marked by an attack on an opponent's character rather than by an answer
to the contentions made
