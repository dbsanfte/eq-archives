Well, that's up to you.  If you plan on taking up tailoring or smithing,
keep those supplies.

As for spell casting, the only class that can "cast" and move at the same
time are bards.

I have gated out of battle many times.  And I've died many times TRYING to
gate out of battle.  Any time a critter hits you there's a chance they'll
interrupt your casting (break your concentration).  As someone mentioned,
channeling is the skill that is used to "regain your concentration and
continue casting."

Here's a tip:   If you want to interrupt casting a spell (and you will MANY
TIMES...either you hit the wrong button or the spell doesn't need to be cast
afterall, or whatever) the most popular method is to take a few steps.
However, channeling will SOMETIMES allow you to do that.  The only SURE way
of interupting your casting is by DUCKING, and keep ducking until the
casting bar is completely gone.  If you stand up early there's a good chance
it'll go off.
