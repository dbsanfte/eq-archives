Which was my point earlier. Monks do fine dammage and if they can attack
from the rear consistently they are useable. A paladin main tank that can
always hold agro meets these conditions.

The monk problem devolves down into a pitcher that only has a nice fast
ball. Its good and untill the batters learn that he only throws one pitch he
will do fine. But when you have a choice of pitchers you will get the one
who has a nice fastball , and a good slider , a fine knuckle ball, and a
useable curveball.

Rogues do more dammage ,tank better, have universal invisibility, can
completely lose aggro on all mobs, can cause all mobs to forget they where
ever there, and can open doors and chests that none of the other 14 classes
can some of which are in completely critcal spots. They can also disarm
lethal traps that are also in critical spots . Rogues are properly balanced
in the middle of the pack of the 15 classes.

Rogues are properly balanced in the middle of the pack of the 15 classes. So
sad that warriors and monks are not . It is absolutely ridiculous when you
compare monks to beastlords and even those lofty creatures are not near the
high 3 of cleric,bard, shaman.
