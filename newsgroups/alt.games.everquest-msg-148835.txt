My, convenient that you didn't "prove" it in the newsgroup yourself.
Why not? because you're bullshitting us again. It's much easier to say
you "proved" it in email to someone and they never passed the proof
on. I notice you don't even tell us who you supposedly provided your
proof to.

Jesus, man, you must think we're total fucking drooling idiots if you
think we're buying this steaming pile of bullshit.
