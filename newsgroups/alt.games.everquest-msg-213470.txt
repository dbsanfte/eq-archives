Had a level 8 necro doing its Blackburrow run (Qeynos faction) - up 
against a beastlord with a higher level pet. My pet was outdamaging the 
Beastlord's... Why? (no gear on either).

Also- how do you raise faction with the wizards in Qeynos? Or don't I? 
They're pretty much the only thing I'm KOS there to right now. Amiable 
to the merchants though some (priest of life) wont sell to me...
