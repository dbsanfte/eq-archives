The reason why I questioned the damage output is because VS's lifetaps
wouldn't be blocked.  He's healing something like 1200hps everytime he
procs.  Even with that many wizards, I'm not sure you could burn him
down fast enough.

Almost as a rule, you need someone to rune the tanks holding VS's
aggro.  But I guess the warriors can all trigger their riposte disc
and have everyone just opened up at full damage (although, I'm not
sure the tanks could hold aggro in that situation).

VS does only have about 18khps which makes him bit of a gimp.
