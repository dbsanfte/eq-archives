Never said I didn't say anything.  Once it dropped just before the fight
started and once while I was medding and missed the message.  If any of the
3 druids had thought to use themselves as a timer (like I had suggested),
neither the warrior, the paladin nor myself would have had to mention it,
let alone say something every time.  With 3 druids, each of them should have
been the buff buddy of one of the non-druids.
