Rogues - I love 'em.  My chanter ( 18 ) fought in Oasis for a bit ( from
15-18 ) and the best group I was in was 4 rogues, a cleric, and me.  By
best, I mean the mobs went down fast, all 6 of us were intelligent and
understood grouping, etc.  There are better combos of classes, of course,
but I just really enjoyed it.  Everyone having a good sense of humor helped,
too.

One of the rogues had to camp, so we picked up a Monk and the party rocked
on.  We were camping at the Ogre Temple in the NW section and there was an
endless stream of Mobs.  It was total fun and endless excitement, and THAT
is what is important to me.

The Exp was good, too =)  Of course, none of this has anything to do with
25+ rogues...

I just got a TP to NK to fight in EK.  Will be a new and exciting
experience.
