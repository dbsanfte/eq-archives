Ah, but their characters represent 400x as many hours as I've put into 
the game. If I spent that much time in the game I'd be right there too.

The relative effort is fair. If I walk up to you and you say I'm uber, 
I've been playing 5 days a week 10 hours a day for a year... I'd say you 
have no life, but you deserve to be uber. If you walk up to me and say 
I'm uber, I bought my account yesterday, and kitted out at the new soe 
online item store for 50.00 I'd say you pretty much sucked the point of 
playing the game out it.

The real flaw here is that EQ is slow enough that you *can* play 
multiple characters simultaneously.

Their is fair and their is fair. Should I run a gf1 with 128MB RAM 
because that's all Jane can afford? Should I only play on weekends for 2 
hours because that's all the time Joe can spare?

Of course not. They're just progressing slower real time. Their putting 
out the same effort, and getting the same stuff for that effort. Buying 
plat devalues the effort itself.
