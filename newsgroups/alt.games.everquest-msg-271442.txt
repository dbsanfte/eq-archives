This is what happens when you build a game around customer whining
rather than having a vision of your own. They set out to solve
'issues' of the original EQ regardless of their effect on the spirit
of gameplay. Its like when they took all the old playgrounds(slides
and jungle jims) and plasticized them with neutered versions of the
same item... you just couldn't hurt yourself. That's EQ2... a decent
game for those who want to be saved from themselves... but a real let
down by those who want to be turned loose.
