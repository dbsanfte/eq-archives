Heh, you beat me to it. :)  He did ask for the BEST way...

But seriously, I'm guessing you don't have 4 manaburn wizards at your 
disposal.

Resists: concentrate on magic, cold resist won't overly help much.

Firepower needs to be caster heavy... all melees WILL get slowed, it's 
just a fact of life.  This IS a caster battle, make no mistake.

While buffing, have a ranger or bard kite her around a bit an try to get 
her mana down.

Pull her in to a waiting melee group.  As soon as they engage melees hit 
offensive discs to build agro and damage before the slow goes off.

At about 70-80% health, 

1) start your enchanters sieving 
2) Land a Ro's Fiery Sundering
3) Wizards, Druids, Mages, start fire nuking

All of this must be done at POINT BLANK RANGE.  That's very very 
important.  It probably goes without saying that as high level as 
possible.. but seriously, too low of a caster probably won't be able to 
land much on Gore.

Good luck with it.
