   It's not that the zones near the gnome homeland that lack for hunting 
that makes the gnomes want to leave.  It's the cities of Ak'Anon itself.
The place is hugh.  The bank is not that easy to find (have a map, and
probably could find it if I really tried, but lit out at level 2 so I
never had to.  Everything is spread out way to far.  But that isn't the
worse thing...this city ticks.  Constantly.  Drove me batty.  I
practically
ran from there screaming.  Really.  I would rather live in Kelethin (my
second least favorite city) than Ak'Anon.
