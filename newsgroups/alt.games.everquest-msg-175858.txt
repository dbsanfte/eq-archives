The Monsters at Outwar are hundreds and thousands of feet tall. They
are armor plated and armed with the finest swords and armor available.
Claws are just the beginning for these monsters.

Best of all, you can actually be one of these monsters. Well, best of
all you can be one of these monsters for FREE. That is right. Be a bad
ass monster who could kick the butt of any of those found in
Everquest, and it won't cost you anything. You can build you monster
and attack other monsters or
better yet Popstars. Imagine taking a bite of Britney or Hanson. The
more you attack, the stronger you become.

No risk. All free. All ages. No credit card. Play anonymously.
