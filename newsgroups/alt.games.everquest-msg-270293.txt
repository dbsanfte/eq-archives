Fortunately Everquest now has a graveyard zone where corpses pop after
a week: so the worst that can happen (bugs aside) is that you don't get
a rez and have to wait a week to get your stuff back.

But in general I agree: up to 35 I used to go all over the place with
my Necro since the XP loss could be made up in a few minutes and I
could summon my corpse for a couple of platinum. Since 50 the XP loss
takes forever to make up if I don't get rezzed and corpse summoning is
expensive, so I'm much less likely to explore level-appropriate areas
on my own (though I do solo the Plane of Fear now and again just
because most people are afraid to go there on a raid, let alone by
themselves :)). With a Cleric or a rich Necro the XP loss after a rez
in the 50s and 60s is fine, but without it can take an hour or two to
recover the XP... who wants to risk that?
