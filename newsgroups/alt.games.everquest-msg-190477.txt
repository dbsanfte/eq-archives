My guild leader, at the time a 54 cleric, made it through the trials back 
in December the first time she tried.  The group that asked her to join 
them had previously failed several times with another cleric so replaced 
them with my GL.

The 4 people I know in the group ( I have the december 5th screenshot of 
the final kill ) are a Warrior, Cleric, Chanter, and Necro.  I don't 
recognize the other 2 people.  3 of them are in the same guild, so are 
probably used to each others' play styles.  I don't think any of the peole 
I know were 60 at the time.
