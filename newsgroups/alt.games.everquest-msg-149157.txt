I was referring to the fact that a mob randomly spawns almost rarely. Even
with my superb tracking skills I can't track a mob that has not spawned yet.
I was hunting in SK for a while kiting gnolls and aviaks and hoping to do
the monk headband quest while I was there. All the time I was there 2 of the
3 npcs I needed did not show up on track which I refreshed after each fight.
About a week of playing there. I did not mind because it was a secondary
objective.

So once again, are there any quests where the npc does not spawn once in a
lifetime? Running around a zone for hours primarily waiting for a mob to
spawn is just boring in my opinion. The hunters pike quest in DSP is good.
Since the 4 mobs are triggered.
