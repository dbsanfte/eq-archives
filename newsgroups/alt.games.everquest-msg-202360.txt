Hm, let me take a look... Eye from the first Griffon I killed... 2HS FS 
sword from the first HG I soloed... A playing card that I have no clue 
where it came from... My quested Rivervale Squad Ring (and also the one 
I looted off a deputy corpse I came across)...

My bank vault is a veritable cabinet of horrors... :)
