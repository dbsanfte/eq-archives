I know this is the generally accepted philosophy, but I don't really get it.
The casters can be bound anywhere, and they can usually gate, so corpse
retrieval is much quicker and easier.  A tank may be bound as far as 6 zones
away in some cases, usually no less than 2, and travelling back without gear
is treacherous. While they are waiting for thier tank to return (in some
cases they can go get him of course, but this is still time consuming) the
casters are sitting around.  Had they allowed (or encouraged) the tank to
make a run for it, while one of them took the hits, the caster would then
respawn in the zone, and tank can escort for corpse retrieval.  Everyone
would be up and running much sooner.

If there is error in my logic please point it out to me politely.   :)
