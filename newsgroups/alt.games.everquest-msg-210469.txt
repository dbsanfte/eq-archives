How many mages do you play with?  The epic pet not only outdamages the
61,62,63 pets but it also has more HP....a LOT more (4500 if i remember
correctly).  For those mages that are leveling before getting AA (which
would be most IMO) then the epic pet crushes those other pets hands down.

But it still stacks with their other dots and most will get it because it is
so easy and has great stats.
