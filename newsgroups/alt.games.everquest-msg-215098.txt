    I get three weeks per year, but I'm not allowed to take vacations when
anyone else I can cover for is away or at times when I'm needed by another
department (payroll, etc.). Since I'm capable of covering for everyone in my
staff, and for both people above me, I'm pretty limited in when I can go.
Entering September, I had two of my three weeks left to take, and if I don't
take 'em, I lose 'em.

    It was nice. Got some rest, played some fun EQ, and just had a blast.
The only sad part? I'm in a Time-capable raiding guild, so I raid daily. I
slept in on Friday and missed morning adventures, and I went out all day
Saturday. The leader on our server Saturday night had three times as many
adventures as I did, and is also in a Time-capable guild. I later found out
that the character is being played in shifts to rack up as many wins as
possible.
