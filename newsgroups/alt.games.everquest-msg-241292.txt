Take your items back to the gnome in SRo and Give them to him. He will take
the item, tell you something about giving you another chance, and will
refund your adventure points. This works for non-LORE augments, probably
works with most any non-LORE item purchased at an adventure merchant. This
is how people buy and sell adventure points on FV. Someone with AP that
wants to turn them into plat simply buys up a bunch of non-LORE augments
from any merchant and then sells the augments to someone who wants to pay
plat for AP (going rate is 80p per AP). The person who buys the augs then
takes them to the gnome and gets AP credited.
