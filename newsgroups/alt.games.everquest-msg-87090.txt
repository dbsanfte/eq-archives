Frankly, yes...

The dynamics are simple -- I won't sell it for
less than 2.5k (or whatever) because if you won't
buy it at that price, someone else soon will, so
it's worth it to me to hold on to it until I
find someone who'll cough up 2.5k.

*However*, I sure wouldn't mind selling it for
more if I run into a buyer who would be willing
to pay more, so I'd be foolish to simply announce
my "lowest amount I'd take for it" price.

Similarly, a prospective buyer would be foolish to
announce the *maximum* price he's willing to pay
for one.

There's a good reason that haggling has been a
millennia-long tradition.

The buyer initially offers less than he's really
willing to spend, and the seller initially asks
for more than he's really willing to settle for.
Then the parties work towards the middle by
changing their bids bit by bit.

But someone's got to be the first to name a price,
and in your example, the seller is asking the buyer
to open the bidding.  The buyer can do so if he
chooses, or turn the tables by saying, "hmm, I
don't know what would be a reasonable offer [*snicker*],
how much would you take for it?"

Haggling can be fun and profitable for both parties
if done properly.  Fun because of the gamesmanship
involved, and profitable because it tends to
prevent buyers from overpaying and sellers from
undercharging.
