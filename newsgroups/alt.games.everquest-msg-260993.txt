My old internal BellSouth DSL modem was a victim of Hurricane Francis and I
got an external BellSouth DSL modem to replace it. My internet browser and
mail/news reader are working but I can not get on Everquest ): . When I
click on the Everquest icon I get "D3D8.DLL files linked to missing export
DDRAW.DLL:LockCB" in a window and "a device attached to the system is not
functioning" in a window under the first window. Can anyone help?
