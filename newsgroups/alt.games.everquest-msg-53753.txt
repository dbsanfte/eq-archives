All of the answers will depend upon the player. Your favorite may be
wildly different than mine. Mine depends upon my mood.

If I want to roleplay, have loads of fun, and not give a damn about exp,
then I pick up my ogre warrior. "Me dink yu a ugry elf, but me hunry -
does yu tasty goot?"

If I want to travel, quest, or solo I play a druid.

If I want to group, be extremely challenged, work for my exp, and bask in
the glow of a damn hard job done well, I play my enchanter.
