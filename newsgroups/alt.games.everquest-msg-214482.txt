Yep, PoK book to Everfrost, zone into Halas, go to the person i was 
directed to, talk for a few moments.  Gate back to PoK (melee would have 
had to make the onerous run out to the PoK book in Everfrost).  Book to 
Freeport, zone into EC head to tunnel, LD, back on a few minutes later, 
talk to the NPC, get my stone.  Took me all of maybe 15 minutes, 
including the LD.  As Sean said, the hard part was picking out my parts 
of the what the NPC said with all the spam.

I will agree that it was pretty pointless to make someone go through 
that, but not terribly time consuming.
