** Demise of the Classic/Velious Interface ** 

Over the last six months we have been keeping the Classic EverQuest
interface as well as the Velious interface working through all of the
features that we have added (built-in MP3 player, item links, compass,
enhanced /bug reporting tool, and others). However, with the release of
some of the new features in this patch, such as running EQ in a window,
we must now say goodbye to the older interfaces. They have been disabled
as of today. 

They served us well. 



** EQ in a Window ** 

EverQuest can now be run in a window. To place EverQuest in a window,
simply press Alt-Enter. You can also switch out of EverQuest to another
program by using the familiar Alt-Tab. It is important that you do not
do this until you are in-game, do not do this during the login process. 

It is important to note a few things. Running the game in a window may
reduce game performance a bit. And, as always, the more programs you
have running at the same time the more resources they use. 

At this time, due to some changes that need to be made on the front end,
it is not possible to run two instances of EverQuest. We will be working
to make the necessary changes over the next few weeks. 



** Songs Window ** 

We have added a new window to the interface along with new game
functionality. The Songs window is a new buff window that holds up to 6
bard song buffs. This increases the potential maximum effects that a
character can have to 21 (15 standard and the 6 new ones). The new
window only holds certain bard songs (generally the 3-tick songs). Only
beneficial songs will qualify for the new buff box, and not all of
those. Any buff in the new Songs window is considered temporary and will
not be saved when you zone. 

Songs that qualify to go into the new window will go into that window
first. Any qualifying songs over six will be rerouted to the main
Effects window. Cancel Magic effects will see these new buff slots as
buff slots #16-21. 

Note for User Interface skin creators: The Label EQTypes 80-85 are the
Songs window song names. 



- Some magical effects on Planar class armor have been altered. In most
cases the effects were upgraded, but a few items were given weaker
effects that were more in line with the difficulty of obtaining them. 
- Fixed a bug that was causing a few Planes of Power NPCs to take too
long to respawn. 
- Wu's Attack should now work correctly. 
- Incoming damage now interacts with Wrath of the Wild and other
rune-type spells in their proper order. 
- Pact of Shadow and Shadow Compact will once again heal player
characters. 
- Charmed Pets will no longer remain charmed after the owner dies. 
- Sending special characters (such as < and ") via EQIM will no longer
freeze the game. 
- Hitting Autoattack when in explore mode at Character Select will no
longer cause the game to crash. 
- The Loadskin window will now load skins other than the default
properly. 
- Fixed and issue that caused some NPC's text to be cut short. 
- Fixed (but did not rename) the Broken Golem. He should no longer be
hated in Fear, just feared... 
-Lowered the duration of calm-type spells that effect creatures level 50
and over.
