At level 65, the only time I use IoS is to buff a cleric that has HoV and 
his self buff that does not stack with Focus.  If the cleric has Po9 and 
Kazad, he can't use his self buff anyway, so he prefers Focus then.  At 
lower levels, I'm not sure, I didn't have IoS until my high 60s.

As an alternative method of getting the spell, Ethereals are easy to 
obtain, and, the BL spell person can give you that spell for an Ethereal.
