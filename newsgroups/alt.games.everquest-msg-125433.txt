it's the minus sign on the numberpad.. if you are using a laptop you'll have
to find out what that equates too.  Also, in the F10 in screen (the one that
gives you 6 hotkey options), there is an 'Option' Button, and in that menu a
'Keyboard' button, in there you can scroll through what all the keys are set
to do.. like instead of having attack being 'A', you can make it 'insert', I
know some people do this so they don't accidently attack merchants and the
like.
