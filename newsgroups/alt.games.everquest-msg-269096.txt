>Do grey con mobs drop chests?

Nope. It's a major way of preventing farming. Of course, some people
have already found the IoR loophole...

You do still get quest credit for grey mobs, so you're not gated if
some quest requires you to kill bog slimes or something.

Otherwise, to make any kind of loot, you will need to actually kill
things of your level. Funny, that.

I'm wondering if the reason I like EQ2 is because I played on Firona
Vie -- which had SCS and Trivial Loot. To me, this is just the way the
game's ALWAYS been...
