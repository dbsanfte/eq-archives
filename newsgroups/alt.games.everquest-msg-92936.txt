After Drianna Poxbourne handed me my hindquarters on a platter when she 
conned light blue to me, I developed an irrational fear of casting 
mobs... Of course, I came back at level 40 and we had words, but even so, 
I try not to engage any caster now, unless they are very green. 

Anyway, the question is... what is the best strategy for a Druid against 
a casting mob? Buff up and nuke nuke nuke? or perhaps Snare, DoT and run 
out of the mob's casting range? Melee it?

What's your advice?
