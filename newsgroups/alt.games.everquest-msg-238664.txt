Reading through Moorgard's description, it sounds a lot like how
Horizons works crafting and adventuring, as I'm sure other games have
handled it, too. (I've never played DAoC, but I swear I recall hearing
they do something like this) All in all, this is the most logical way
to go about it. You still don't have to go out and adventure ever if
you really don't want to, but you can without having to sacrifice
being an artisan.
