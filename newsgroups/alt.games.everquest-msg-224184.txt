They are enabled for player-killing (but see the last paragraph
below.)

When Everquest was originally designed, the developers apparently
thought that it would be fun to occasionally battle other players
instead of just killing monsters all the time.  And indeed I have
heard that it can be very exciting and rewarding, when both players
are willing.  There's nothing like a pitched battle against a crafty
human foe.  And it gets even more exciting when whole teams of
players battle each other.  Kind of like Team Fortress or Battlefield
1942.

Unfortunately, there are players who abuse this ability and
deliberately set out to ruin your game experience, killing you over
and over when you have no chance to fight back.  That's no fun.

Therefore, most of the Everquest servers don't allow player-killing,
except in special circumstances.  One of those circumstances involves
performing a quest with the Priest of Discord that turns your name
red, indicating that you are enabled for PvP (player vs player)
combat.

However, as you have seen, red-named players are extremely rare,
because it puts you at a HUGE disadvantage: blue players and red
players cannot cast spells on each other.  No heals, no buffs,
no SoW.  Ever.

And it doesn't really gain them very much, because the only players
they can attack are the other players who also turned their names
red.
