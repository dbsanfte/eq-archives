Well I'm no jeweller, but AFAIK the only +WIS rings you can make are
jasper rings - the engagement rings are made with rose quartz or
something and give +INT, not +WIS. I'm sure your intended would be happy
to recieve a velium jasper ring as an engagement ring though, they give
+7 WIS I believe, and are going for about 450pp each on MT if my sources
are correct (next step down, platinum +6 WIS rings are about 200pp
each).
