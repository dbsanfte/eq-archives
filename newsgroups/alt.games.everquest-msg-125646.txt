Nice idea, and would work in the manner you suggest... but (you KNEW there
had to be a 'but')... switching to target yourself, and trying to channel
Cancel Magic onto yourself while a ghoul is whailing on your defenceless
face probably isn't worth the loss of damage you could be dishing out in
return... and by the time you CAN get a spell off, the root might have
already faded.

I'm reasoning along the lines of... 'if you're low enough that you're facing
opponents where Cancel Magic would work against their spells, then you're
probably too low to reliably 'channel' thru a melee situation... and if you
ARE high enough to 'channel', then Cancel Magic prolly isn't going to be
powerful enough to remove their spell'

Your idea sounds pretty good... good enough that I suspect someone else must
have tried it before... and if it works well enough to use on a regular
basis, I would have thought it would become a standard tactic... and bearing
in mind it isn't a standard, I'm guessing it doesn't work reliably enough.
