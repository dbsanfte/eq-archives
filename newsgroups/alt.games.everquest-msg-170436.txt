The problem occurs when a "family guild" sees the higher ups leave and
doesn't realize its a natural lifecycle thing and everyone takes it
personal. So if A leaves I am leaving too happens and once all hell breaks
loose if there is not enough "critical mass " the folks remaining slowly
fade away burnout server switch play alts etc etc..

I think recognizing the guilds goal as a family guild and well wishing those
that move on to endeveavors that take more than one group would help
maintain developed relationships.
