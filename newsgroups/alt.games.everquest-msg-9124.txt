Some guy handed me an Ice of Velious  (my level 8 enchanter) and told me if
I take the boat to velious, and give it to a dwarf in a hut at the dock, he
will give me directions to a cave where I will meet level 15 frost giant
cubs who drio velium weapons.  Is this correct? I can find no reference to
mobs under level 28 on allakhazams, and obviouslyt this would be a great
source of money in my teens if this is true? can anyone confirm or deny
this?
