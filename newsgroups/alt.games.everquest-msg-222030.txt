Hardly typical though. I've been in a group were a 55 druid was main
healer for consorts in PoN but it's not the kind of thing I'd hold up
as a good example of druid healing. Your average group tries either of
these and they'll get own so fast it won't even be funny.

Are there still high levels out there that aren't willing to take 90%
pally rezzes?
