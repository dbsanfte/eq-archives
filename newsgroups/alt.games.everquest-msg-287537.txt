*** Test Server Update ***

Here is a list of some of our more visible changes that have been made 
with this update.


*** Highlights ***

- The 10th Veteran Reward, Summon Resupply Agent, is now available!

- Type 3 augmentations are now available. Check your local Faydwer 
faction vendor!

- Alternate Advancement experience has been accelerated significantly 
for those with fewer AAs spent and will scale back down to the normal 
rate as more AAs are earned.

- The experience gained formulas have been modified to present players 
with a much smoother increase in the number of kills required to 
progress through a level as they gain more levels. This change has the 
side effect of reducing the number of kills required to gain a level in 
certain scenarios between levels 50 and 75.

- All keyed zones from the Ruins of Kunark, Scars of Velious, Shadows of 
Luclin, Planes of Power, Gates of Discord, Omens of War, Depths of 
Darkhollow, and Prophecy of Ro have had their key/flag requirements 
modified. All players that have obtained the key/flag will still be 
allowed entry into the zones, as will players that have met minimum 
level requirements for the zones. The minimum level requirements are as 
follows:

Required Level 46

* The Howling Stones
* Old Sebilis
* Skyshrine


Required Level 55

* Veeshan's Peak
* Vex Thal
* Locked areas of the Temple of Ssraeshza


Required level 57

* Bastion of Thunder
* Halls of Honor
* The Temple of Marr
* Tower of Solusek Ro
* Drunder, The Fortress of Zek


Required Level 60

* Plane of Water
* Plane of Air
* Plane of Fire
* Plane of Earth
* Ikkinz
* Uqua
* Yxtta
* Kodtaz


Required Level 62

* Plane of Time
* Inktuta
* Qvic


Required Level 65

* Txevu
* Tacvi


Required Level 68

* Anquish


Required Level 70

* Dreadspire
* Demiplane of Blood


Required Level 72

* Theater of Blood
* Deathknell


*** Items ***

- The engineer steamworks that work within the guardian have developed 
devices that help them move within the beast. Fortunately for 
adventurers they can be a bit absent minded about them and adventures 
can find them lying about.
- A vial of raging heartblood is not as vile as it was previously.


*** Spells ***

- Secrets of Faydwer's Talisman of the Puma has been renamed to Talisman 
of the Cougar.
- Cast time on Quellious' Word of Tranquility has been reduced from 4 to 
2 seconds.
- The Adrenal Boost focus effect has been changed to Life Line, which is 
a mana cost reduction on Pure Life.
- The Closefisted Claw focus effect has been changed to Ethereal Breath, 
which is a damage increase on Ethereal Conflagration.
- Breastplate worn effects that enhanced one rank of a spell or 
discipline now enhance all three ranks.
- Reuse time reduction bonus on Assassin's Efficacy, Impenetrable Body, 
and Fit of Berserking Rage have been set to 25%.
- The Rage of Tri'Qaras effect triggered from Bulwark of Tri'Qaras is 
now a damage bonus that stacks with other effects.
- The recourse from the Challenge for Honor line will now appear in the 
bard buff box.
- The Vinelash Ensnare effect triggered from Vinelash Cascade will no 
longer overwrite Entrap.
- The efficiency of Secrets of Faydwer direct damage spells now scales 
up on higher ranks of the same spell.


*** NPC ***

- Halima in Crescent Reach can now be found in the find window.
- Henrik O`Danos no longer sells Hypericum twice.


*** Quests & Events ***

- Rylin Coil will now show and give all three tinkering mastery books 
for the tinkering mastery quest.


*** AA ***

- Increased the range of the Wrath of the Wild AA line to match other 
Damage Shield spells that Druids have.
- Increased the hitpoints and resists of all "Wards" for all classes to 
make them better able to resist ambient damage while performing the 
tasks the abilities were created for.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- Hidden corpses should now be hidden properly when entering proximity.
- The 'pop in' delay of hidden corpses when entering proximity should no 
longer exist.
- /who corpse should now properly display player corpses in zone.
- Changed NPC summon behavior to summon the player right in front of 
their current heading at 1/2 their melee range. Calculations used to 
determine when the NPC should summon have been made a bit more accurate. 
Please let us know if you experience any odd behavior when being 
summoned, either problems with being placed in geometry or some other 
location that seems incorrect. Also let us know if an NPC summons when 
it still seems like you are in its melee range.
- Pet Hold should no longer prevent the pet from attacking when it is 
ordered to attack.
- Iksar should now be able to receive a cap increase after purchasing AA.
- Corrected a problem with hate generation from skill attack abilities 
such as Hail of Arrows and Decimator's Volley. They were generating 
considerably more hate than they should and have been returned to their 
previous, lower hate generation.
