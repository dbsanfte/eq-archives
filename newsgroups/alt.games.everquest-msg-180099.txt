OK DT, Let's see what you said.
Here's the your original response:

>No, because there are no black elves or asian dwarves in Norrath.

OK true,  there are no black elves in EQ. But there are black elves in
lore.They are an off-shoot of wild eleves with black skin almost like
onyx and black hair, sometimes known as Drows. And for that matter
there are also Asian elves. Now where Elves are from the Fay race,
Dwarves on the other hand are from the faerie race.Five kind of
dwarves, Hill ,Mountain, Plains,Desert and Swamp. And they have
"color" too. Hill dwarves are more Mediterranean in color with Tan
skin and dark hair, sometimes gray. Mountain dwarves are what we have
in EQ,  light skin with black, brown and white hair even though there
are a few "deep" mountain dwarves that never see light with very light
skin some even light blue.Plains dwarves are the odd balls being the
tallest of the lot, with green or yellow skin.
Desert dwarves have gold skin and Swamp Dwarves have green skin.
But they don't really have any different physical feature other than
skin color or height, they pretty much look the same.

Here's the comment you made:

> It's not a racist issue. Asian/black/etc are "sub-races" in the human race.

Asian, black,etc are "sub-races" of the human race...Well, considering
the main topic was basically why most races in EQ are white and we
need more color, I don't think "White" is included in the Etc. And you
said "Human race" not " human race in Norrath" which of course we all
know that there is only one "human race" in Norrath, and it's white.
Well, not sure if that's what you "meant" to say but by saying that
all other races other than white are a sub-race , even if it was in
game, is racist thinking. So in your statement ,if I'm a black
(sub-race) man (Human) I'm sub-human to you. I don't see how I'm
twisting any word around when you made it so simple to see. I think
you just typed how you really feel about "color" with out really
knowing. I mean come on DT, "Asian/black/etc are "sub-races" in the
human race".

>If you want to play a black man, play an Erudite. Asian, well...play a
>human monk.

Hmm.... well a Erudite does have african features so that is as close
in game you can get to playing a black man in game.
And as far as the monk, well.... we all know the monk is a "white
human" unless you want to be a Iksar, not a asian. And what's up with
that quote,"Asian, well...play a human monk." In other words your
saying that anybody that knows Martial Arts "has got to be" Asian,
right? That is what your impling, is it not. That if you want to play
an Asian go play a monk, "because he knows Kung-Fu". In RL I'm a
assist Sensi and guess what I'm not Asian , for that matter my Sensi,
who also plays EQ is also not Asian. You are so wrong .
