Small Portal Fragment.  Componant for all wizard TLs to places other
than bind or big spires.  Wizards can TL you to anyplace they can
port, but if it's not Bind, Dreadlands, Greater Faydark, North Karana,
or Tox Forest, it requires a small portal fragment as a componant.
They can be purchased in Temple of Solusk Ro, and cost about 1pp each.
I pick up a stack whenever I'm in the area.
Side note:  I just saw that there is a Translocate:  Nexes spell
listed at 39 for Wizards.  Does this work from anywhere, or only on
Luclin?
