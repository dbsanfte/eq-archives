Shaman tend to get same heals as druid, but not as early.  Clerics, for 
that matter, get the same heals but even earlier.  My shaman finally got 
Superior Healing at level 51... a spell my druid would also get at 51 
(if he hadn't retired at 34) but my cleric got at 34.  Greater Healing: 
Cleric 24, Druid 29, Shaman 29.

Well that blows my thesis, the shaman and druid get their 1 to 51 heals 
at the same points.

Well, without examining the question any closer, I will observe that the 
drawback of a shaman bot would be that to run a shaman at full power you 
need to be cannibalizing nearly constantly, so assuming that you 
conclude a well played shaman and a well played druid would be equally 
helpful, then the shaman bot is going to be the loser.

That said, you are going to have to work pretty hard to convince me that 
a druid is a better companion for a melee that can't slow or haste 
himself.  Absent a chanter, the shaman can slow, haste -and- heal.  When 
you kill mobs 25% faster due to your haste, while the mobs do only 50% 
damage due to being slowed, thats 33% the HP loss that has to be 
healed.  For a druid to be as good a healer, he'd have to do three times 
the healing, not just the same healing.

The paladin has rez too, and not terrible ones.  Plus again, until 
CHeal, the cleric heals have to compete with a shaman healing a mere 
third as much damage, and even with the advent of CHeal, the paladin has 
to have a LOT of HP loss for this to beat out Stoicism for efficiency 
given this 1:3 ratio.  The cleric might still have the edge over a 
shaman that isnt' chain cannibalizing, though, as a general rule, but 
his buffs overlap with the paladins, while the shaman will be able to 
boost HP with a line that stacks with the paladin's, and boost other 
melee stats too if they become interesting (realistically, only Dex is 
likely to be, but if the paladin has good proc weapons that can be 
pretty nice.

Atone is a mana hog as far as PLing goes, although getting him a clicky 
atone weapon might work out

On the plus side, the druid does have pretty good DS and DOT output 
including an array of no mana clicky DOTs; besides healing and slowing 
and hasting, you have to take into account the ability to do damage to 
mobs in order to kill them faster; druids tend to outshine both clerics 
and shaman at this last.  Whether this makes any sense in a dual box 
environment I'm not sure.

Transportation -to- the fight site yes, but getting OUT is another 
story.  Paladins can't gate without using potions or perhaps the OT 
hammer (can paladins get their faction up enough to get that?) so having 
evac can be very handy for them, thats something neither a shaman nor 
cleric can do for them... on the other hand, with the paladin getting up 
to POP levels, evac isn't really much of an issue for exping purposes.
