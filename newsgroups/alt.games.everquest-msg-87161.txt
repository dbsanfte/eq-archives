I mean why are use Largo's vs. Selo's Constant Chain.  Selo's is the same 
slow percentage, with a HUGE snare, though it doesn't lower AC.  Also, 
since it's single target, you can actually cast it outside of melee range.  
It's also very helpful on runners, as in it will stop them dead in their 
tracks.  Generally the only time I use AE slows are when I'm doing CC and 
slows in a group with neither a chanter nor a shaman.  Even then I keep a 
targeted slow up for pulling or stopping runners.   
A quick hint....if you pull with snare, and you aggro a 2nd, you can often 
run far enough to get the snared one to ignore you.  Kill the add, then 
run back by the first one, and he should aggro again.  Not sure it works 
at lower levels, but it's pretty effective at higher levels.

Hymn is always nice.  Even without a lute it does enough healing to be 
helpful.  Of course since you're using voice songs, you might want to play 
with Amplification a bit.  It makes voice songs MUCH more effective.

Well, pretty close.  Learn how long your charm song takes to recycle, 
start your recharm right before it breaks.  I generally used selos and 
hymn to time.  Start off with selos, with a drum equipped (they can't hit 
what they can't catch).  Run up, find your pet and your intended victim, 
sing charm song, and as SOON as it hits, start selos, target your victim, 
and hit pet attack.  Then hit f1 twice to select your pet again.  If you 
haven't taken any damage yet, let selos run, and just as it pulses the 3rd 
time, start your charm song.  Hit selos, select target, /pet attack, f1 
twice, repeat.  If you do get hit and take a bit of damage, do a selos, 
hymn, selos, hymn twist, which should set up the timing for recharm 
perfectly.

Well, when I was charm-kiting, I was picking the hardest-hitting melee 
mobs I could find.  I considered a perfect charm-kite to be one where I 
never got hit.  I would strongly recommend staying well out of range.  
(The charm songs have a decent range too, I take that as a hint.)  If you 
pick the right mobs, they die fast anyway.  Charming, like almost all 
soloing, is about picking the right mobs.  Hill giants are great, 
drachnids are bad.  SK gnolls are good, unempt druids are bad.

The best place to practice I found was SK gnoll spires.  They hit hard for 
their level, but aren't very fast, and there is that nice 2-spawn.  Once 
you get it down there, go to Rathe Mtns and kill Cyclops.  Watch out for 
the named, though when he spawns, he makes a GREAT pet.  Just keep using 
him to kill stuff, and when he's almost dead, turn on him and kill him for 
exp.
One thing that is hard to explain, but obvious once you experience it is 
how proximity affects your victim.  If you're too close, victims often 
come after you, especially if you've cast on them.  I like to stay just at 
the edge of charm-song range and make sure the victim is attacking my pet.  
This is especially critical with casters.  (The only way I could kill 
unkempt druids to atone for some treant killing was to use the cyclops to 
do my dirty work for me.)

> [1]Say, I notice you ducked the bit about CHA and effect on bard 
> charming.  Your thoughts?

I honestly haven't tested enough to know.  I have good CHA, and even in my 
20s it was over 120 all the time, and over 140 with my CHA gear, so either 
I was past the magic number, or it has a minimal effect.
I don't think charm is the bard class-defining song, but I still use it 
ALL the time.  Last night in Bartender in Seb we lost our shammy and our 
rogue, were down to warrior, ranger, mage, and I.  Just kept pulling, I 
could mez one add, charm another, sic my pet on the target, and then do a 
bit of bashing myself and repeat.  I started off just mezzing the adds, 
but the warrior complained about lack of damage output, and the ranger 
confirmed that he had to heal a LOT less when I was charming and fighting 
alongside.
