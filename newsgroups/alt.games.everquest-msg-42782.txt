People generally don't charge for a sow.  In fact, if you offer a coin or
two in the trade window the trade will usually be canceled, but I would like
to point one thing out.  Even though that trade is usually canceled, don't
think that the offer isn't greatly appreciated.

I can't tell you how many times a player will run up to my druid while I'm
in a group and in the middle of a fight and ask me for a sow then stand
there right in my field of view til I sit, mem the spell, and cast it on
them, whence they proceed to run off without so much as a word, like sowing
everybody is a druid's job and it's expected of them.

Given that the above scenery is the case more often than not, I love it when
somebody offers me a couple of coins to express their understanding that
what I have just done is a favor and not something that is "expected" of me,
although I always cancle the trade.  So even though hardly anybody accepts
payment for a sow, it's nice to offer what you can afford.  Even if it's
just a gold piece or two.

Best Regards
