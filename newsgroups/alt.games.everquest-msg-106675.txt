Well my 28 de rogue hit the shores of Karnark(sp?) on the weekend.  Actually
it was via the nexus to DL, ran from the DL to Overthere and bound myself.
I took a few minutes to acquaint myself with the outpost and then ventured
out for some killing.

Unfortunately, everything I found was either green, or red.  There seemed to
be a couple of other people around my lvl in that zone, but they weren't
interested in grouping.  Looked at everlore regarding adjacent zones and see
that Lake of ill omen runs from about 20 - 25  or so for beasts... I may be
a bit high to hunt there, and without question too low to fight in the
dreadlands (what a scary place for a 28)

Where do I go to kill (while maintaining positive faction to be bound in OT)


Thanks!
