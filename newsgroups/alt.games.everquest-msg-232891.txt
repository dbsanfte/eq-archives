Most definately.  As a matter of fact, he said "if I'm going to get aggro'd 
in wolf form, I might as well not use it since I find it disorienting" So 
he'd drop wolf form and played as normal.  Oh and get this.  We're grouped 
right?  He's slashing away and I'm medding.  I con a mob and I'm still 
indifferent.  Maybe that's normal.  I can't remember if I had healed him or 
not.  Probably not.

Lots of skellies in Unrest.  The greenies wouldn't aggro him like the green 
goblins in Sol A.  I always figured a skelleton would aggro because they 
had a "no fear of death" type of personality.
