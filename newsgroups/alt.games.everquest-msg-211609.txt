So, it's getting more and more common for me to fight MoBs that dispell my
buffs. (That's why you always put your crap/own buffs on top, and let KEI
come in a distant 5 or 6! :-))
But I have yet to find myself a handy right-click insta-buff piece of armor
or something, to carry around in my inventory.
Besides, some guilds REQUIRE that you have this capability, to even be
considered for the guild.
I've been looking around a bit, but have yet to find a single item with this
ability for my 59 druid...
Any suggestions? (It doesn't have to be extremely useful, just instantly
cast, and preferably useable indoors and outdoors).

Thanks,

Lalor Windrider
