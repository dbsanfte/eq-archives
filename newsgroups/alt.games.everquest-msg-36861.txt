Someone got a celestial heal off an orc pawn once. (I watched him loot it,
too)

Sorry I didn't know any clerics (wasn't in a guild at the time)... and no
one seemed to want to buy it for the day that I auctioned it... for 10 plat!

On this same line, the fourth guy to fight a particular Lego (two dead,
second managed to get away) got the "pinata" open...

Velium long sword, full set of small patchwork, a shield, and something else
that I---er... someone twinked the lego with (GLS, maybe? I don't remember
for sure).
