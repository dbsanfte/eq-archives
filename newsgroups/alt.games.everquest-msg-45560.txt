Running 

Win98se, 
Directx8a, 
IWILL KA266-R motherboard
768mb PC2100 ddr ram, 
Athlon 1.4ghz cpu, 
the ElSA Gladiac 920, 
tried both v12.41 and v21.81 of detonators.  

My problem is I'm in a Everquest zone where absolutely no ground,
walls, monsters, objects are painting--all I see is sky in all x/y/z
directions.  The game is directx7 and usually paints at least 25-50%
of the objects in the zone.  Since I built the new system I have
navigated through the game -from memory-.  But not being able to see
anything at all is a prob.

I've deleted all my EQ option and .ini files several times.  

Verant is no help.  They say they've never heard of it and to move my
PCI boards around in my machine when there's no evidence of IRQ
conflict.

Ordered an Abit i850 motherboard for a P4-1500.  When it gets here and
the game paints, I swear to God I'm going to take a sledge hammer to
both the AMD CPU and the IWILL piece-of-sh-t motherboard.
