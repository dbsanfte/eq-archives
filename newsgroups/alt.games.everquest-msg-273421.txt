Start your own group, then. Use the search tool to find some LFG-people
fitting your needs, send them a tell and ask if they want to help finish
this here quest you have. You'll be surprised how many are willing to help
out if you ask them. When you're done, ask them what they want to do now,
and help them do it. Before you disband, make sure to put each other on your
respective friends lists and you may have something lasting and valuable
going on.

IMO, this is the pivotal idea of EQ2. You get to meet people and make
friends helping each other achieve various goals. This not just something
you can choose to do. In a sense, it's what the game is all about.

However, if SOE listened to all you solo-whiners ;-) and made soloing just
as rewarding as grouping, it would become much more difficult to find the
people you need when you need them. Norrath would become a colder place,
because most people would just keep to themselves, myself included.

You just need to reward grouping - or penalize soloing, if you will.
Otherwise, a very basic idea of the game is jeopardized. Those gray mobs you
see are the designers' way of punishing you for not completing a group quest
when it was suitable for you. Take your punishment like a man, or stick to
the soloable quests, of which there are plenty. It's impossible to do all
quests in the game with one character anyway; you'll always level too fast
for that.

Don't think that I don't know how you feel. It's in my nature to keep to
myself, and I solo a lot more than I group. However, because there's so much
in EQ2 that I cannot do on my own, I have to join up with others now and
then, and I have to admit that this is when the game shows its full
potential. Sure, there has been nightmare groups that I wish I had never
met, but the best moments always come while grouping.
