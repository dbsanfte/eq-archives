Hi, Ranger spell nuke/dot DPS + archery specific haste requirements ;)

Not to mention heal focii, mana focii, etc, etc ;)

Sure you have those issues too; but so do other classes. Ranger is
a generalist really, just a weaker one than BL's.

But you're focusing solely on DPS - and obviously its not just about
DPS. That monk needs AC and HP too, maybe a coin purse and some weight
reducing bags, pulling tool clickies/summoning devices, etc

...which means... more upgrades ;) 

You can't say 'They increase their DPS with one upgrade, but we have
to upgrade all these other facets of our class', because they also
have to upgrade all these other facets of their classes; mana regen,
spell foci, utility tools, hp, ac, resists, etc, etc. Everyone is
gear dependant to operate well, and only the real specialists begin
to get away from this. Rogues, perhaps. Wizzies still have to sustain
their DPS via mana regen, capacity, focii, etc.

Damn, rogues are lucky ;)

You're almost entirely self sufficient and can round out any group, so
its far easier to get a group; specialists, unlike you, are looking
for a partciular *slot* in the group, and cant fill any other role
if its already taken.

Really, its jealousy partly - EQ is based around competition between
classes and Beastlords have a pretty easy life. They do, to a degree,
break the EQ dependancy paradigm. Its probably just a matter of persepctive
about whether this is a good or bad thing ;)
