So? And I have seen most clerics I know hand out free rezzes. Man your
server must be full of greedy bastards then. Most clerics I have seen take
donations but never ask for money unless you want them to go across
several zones or get ported somewhere.

You only need a wizard for 2 planes, hate and sky I think. Growth, Fear
and Mischief all have portals to them.

Usually anyone that goes to a plane raid is going with a guild that better have
wizards and clerics there to port, rez and help with a CR. Its not like
a plane is a place where you go for pick up groups.
