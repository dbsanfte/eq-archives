Hail, all!

What type arrows do tanks use to pull: cheap and long-range or do they go
for max damage (and expense)?

What are the affordable throwing weapons used to pull?

As a low-twenties warrior, I pull with my bow and have my fletching skill up
to 102 but it`s pretty darn expensive with my base 37 cha...

Also, my archery skill is just crawling along... Any ideas as to how I could
raise it besides using practice points?

Regards,

OgreLowbie
