If you try out the magician guild in Erudin (Tower of the Gate Callers) one
of the trainers will give you a quest which rewards you with the gloves of
the gate callers (black). From reading some posts on a noticeboard
elsewhere, these gloves are one of the very few which actually show up on
your character. It's a 1st level quest and only invovles summoning food and
daggers, easy.
