One theory I have is that they were all too weak and lacked the
fortitude to stand up to Bizbee's bizarre bully-boy tactics. It is,
after all, a whole lot easier than actually standing by your
principles.

I understand that Lokari showed some spirit at one point, but Bizbee
soon broke her again.

Perhaps the "Usual Suspects" were all victims of bullying fathers and
get some weird kind of comfort in slipping back to their
pre-adolescent role as submissives.

There's a soap opera unfolding? They're all killfiled, so I'm
blissfully unaware of it (other than what gets quoted in mb's replies)
:)

Seconded.
