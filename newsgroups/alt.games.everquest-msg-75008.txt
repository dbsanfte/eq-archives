	Most of the mobs in the Enchanter epic are immune to magic.  The same is
true of the Necromancer epic.  Druids have at least one (Ulump) they can't
cast on.

	If you could cast on them, half a dozen casters would get together and
blow them to pieces.  These are all pre-Velious mobs, they have 32K health
max.  A few Wizards could just ping-pong them to death.
