Hrmm.  Isn't it common to have someone cast Invis on
the porter (after they begin the port, of course) so
they don't aggro the zone-in area?  Unless Invis drops,
you can then run to the wall and (reasonably) safely Gate
out.  And that person has plenty of time to Invis and
disband before the portal goes off...
