Yes, you can convert to a paid account, after which you have to register CD
keys to get the expansions.  I'd still suggest getting EQ Gold, because the
entire package often costs less than any two of the expansions... and there
are four expansions to get.  So even though you've already got Classic,
you'd be doing better to get Gold and use it to upgrade your Classic
account.
