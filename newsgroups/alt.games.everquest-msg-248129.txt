> Please halt the release of EQ2.

Well spoken, but you and I both know that these sentiments won't get any
kind of traction within SOE. The project is a go and there's already way too
much momentum and infrastructure in place; no one's going to pull the plug
at this stage.

SOE is a business and now part of one of the world's premier consumer
products companies. As such, corporate culture is going to make them keep
looking for growth opportunities. EQ is just too long in the tooth. Although
it has a very loyal customer base, I just don't see growth potential in this
product any longer. If I recall correctly, recent numbers have shown that
the EQ subscriber base is declining, not growing. It may not be a critical
decline, but it probably doesn't look like anything like growth.

I think it's a smart thing for them to start building a new foundation for
the franchise, one that has real growth potential. WoW and others loom on
the horizon and it seems a reasonable business strategy to try and fend off
that threat by building a new venue for the game, one that plays to the
strengths of the original, takes advantage of emerging technologies that add
substance, and fully exploits the incumbent advantage. I have no idea if EQ2
has what it takes to do this, but I think if done correctly it's probably
the best long term strategy for growth for the series.

I'm no longer an EQ player and I don't have any current interest in going
back, but I am very interested in EQ2 and plan on playing in the beta.
Here's a way for SOE to capture someone like me (and there must be tens of
thousands like me) and keep the customer base they've groomed all these
years. But (and here's the kicker), I'm also very interested in WoW and
eager to try that out.

Man, this is going to be some race, eh? More than ever, timing will be
critical. All other things being equal, whoever gets out first has the
opportunity to capture a huge part of the audience that could go either way.
And most of us don't have the cycles for more than one MMOG at a time and
will likely hang our hat in one camp or the other. May the best product win
our hearts!

It's a great time to be an MMOG player!
