I've spent quite some time measuring low level haste caps.  All my data's 
on the other computer though.  But I've mostly worked with level 1 
characters of various races and various starting stats.  The level 1 haste 
cap doesn't vary by race or stats, but -does- appear to vary by class.  
For a level 1 warrior, it's about 24.8%. A level 1 shaman appears to be 
capped at ~20%, but I need more data still.

So there'd be no difference for the FBSS, and about a 6% loss with the 
mith2h.  I actually did the test with level 1 warrior naked except for 
FBSS, and measured exactly 22% haste.

The other branch of this thread, "why not make it a 20/31ish weapon 
instead?", seems to be missing the key point that mith2h is a pre-KUNARK 
weapon.  Back when the level cap was 50 and LGuk -was- the extreme 
endgame.  A warrior with a mith2h and an FBSS is something we'd laugh at 
today, but at the time, I'm sure the developers were worried he'd be able 
to 2-box naggy or something if they stacked.  That lovely level 51+ damage 
bonus on two-handers wasn't relevant... There was no level 51+ then.
