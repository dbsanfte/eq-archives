Well, as already pointed out, many EQ players have Real Lives (many more
than you'd think)
On top of this, many casual players know that before posting to an NG to
read some posts first to see if they can find anything that will help them
before, possibly, repeating a question.

On top of this you will notice that Gets' post was in reply Greafaxe and not
yours, Greafaxe would not have seen the post, mind you thanks to filters,
not that Gets really cares who he gets a reaction from.
