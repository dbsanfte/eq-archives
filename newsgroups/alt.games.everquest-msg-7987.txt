1) Enable melees to be bound anywhere that casters can be bound.

2) Enable people to swim through ocean zone lines into OOT, Timorous Deep,
Iceclad, Erud's Crossing, etc.

3) Lower death penalty to half a blue bubble, but you come back with 20%
health and no mana.

4) All gnomes start with an additional +25 to all stats and resists.
