Disagree, most of the goblins in the flag room and beyond aggro anything,
many of the standard fighters don't but the casters do. I was there with my
Warrior (51) and Druid (45) and had to use invis most of the time to avoid
trouble (altho some of the casters have see invis) I had a friend come in
after a piece for the warrior epic, she's 52 and when I met up with her was
very low on health. A 53rd warrior in there could easily find himself in
trouble and swarmed, I'm not saying it's a definite no no just I wouldn't
risk it solo.
