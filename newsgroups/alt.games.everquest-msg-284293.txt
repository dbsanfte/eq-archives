Many of us on Combine are hoping that time sinks like this one will slow 
the headlong rush to open expansion after expansion as fast as possible, 
and let us enjoy the less expanded game for longer; if you have to key a 
raid sized force, and are competing with other guilds for keys, it could 
be quite a while before a sufficient force is set to go break the next 
barrier.

I'm not sure what you think the ideal EQ model would be, one where you 
can level up to the top and get all the top gear in a month of play? 
Thats the model for most single player CRPGs; get someone to buy the 
game and give them sufficient play to feel they got their money's worth, 
but then leave them wanting to buy another game.

The subscription MMOG model, though, is to give them so much content 
that they keep paying the monthly fee; it doesn't make a lot of sense to 
build a game you can "beat" rapidly if you can keep the income flowing 
in month after month, year after year, instead.

I agree that some of the methods SOE has used to help put the Ever in 
EverQuest have been too much, VT key among them... but I don't argue 
with the concept of time sinks, just the nature of some of them.
