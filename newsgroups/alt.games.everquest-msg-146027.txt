I think they went too far with the 'stick' this time as well.
The more difficult mobs should have gotten the exp. boost
to help group exp. 'Risk vs. Reward' should be the norm.

But nerfing the exp from low/light blue mobs is just bad.
All that does is piss off people who just want to kick back
and do some relaxing and easy soloing.

The thing that Verant should also do is go in an look at the exp.
given for each and every individual mob. Not all mobs are
equal of a given level, yet they are all assigned the same
exp. The exp given should take into account special abilities
and spell casting. Everyone hunts the same easy places and
leaves the 'hard' mobs uncamped because of the Risk vs. Reward.

I try to avoid over crowded areas and venture out into the 'wilderness.'
Many times I find a camp of mobs out in the middle of no where
that no one is camping. So I give the camp a go. Which many times
results in me standing naked at my bind point and thinking: "Ah!
Now I know why no one was hunting that camp." =) and if I do manage
to kill something at that out of the way camp the loot is crap. Yet
another reason its not hunted.
