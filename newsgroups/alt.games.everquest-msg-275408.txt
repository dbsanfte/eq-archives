I've met a few people over the years who weren't religious fanatics,
who felt that filtering was a good idea. One was/is an atheist. One
librarian told me last year she didn't like the idea of filtering,
but felt it was better than someone suing the library. Of course,
the stupid filtering software prevents anyone from looking at many
cancer sites.
