Here's a tip in case you don't know.  If you aren't good at getting an
ability up, say, something like.. I don't know, Sense Heading (*wink *wink),
make the Sense Heading key, put it in your hotkeys, say in number 7.  Then
go into options, keyboard, Hotkey Number 7, left click on it, press the left
arrow, right click on it, press the right arrow.  Now everytime you move
using the arrow keys (a lot for me, I use my keyboard and my mouse at the
same time for moving), you'll hit the Sense Heading button.. your skill will
go up nice and quick.
