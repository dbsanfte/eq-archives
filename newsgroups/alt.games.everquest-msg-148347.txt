I was passing through Qeynos hills when a fellow druid named Aluan ran up to
me asking for a heal.  Without thinking, I threw a heal on him.  Next thing
I knew I was getting a bunch of "faction got worse" messages.  Seems he was
kiting  Rilca Leafrunner.

 I went from amiably to dubious in Surefall/Jaggedpine with one heal on the
jerk.  I know I should have stopped and thought of what might do that damage
to a level 40 druid, but I'm not the sharpest person sometimes. My only
comfort is that his corpse is now laying in Surefall,  I'm guessing he
didn't have a clue on what he was doing.

My question is, what is the fastest way to get my faction with
surefall/jagged pine back up at least to where they will talk and deal with
me?   Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Harkenson, Level 29 druid
