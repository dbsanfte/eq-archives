Jimi Hendrix
All Along The Watchtower

There must be some kind of way out of here,
said the joker to the thief
theres too much confusion,
I cant get no relief.=20
Business men they drink my wine,
plow men dig my Earth,
none with a level on their mind,
nobody out of this world.=20

No reason to get excited,
the thief he kindly spoke,
there are many here among us,
who think that life is but a joke,
but you and I, we've been through that,
and this is not our fate,
so let stop talking falsely know,
the hour is getting late.=20

All along the watchtwer,
princes kept the view,
while all the women came and went,
barefoot servants too.=20

Outside in the cold distance,
a wild cat did growl,
two riders were approaching,
and the wind began to howl.=20

All along the tower,
everywhere,=20

everywhere I went...=20
