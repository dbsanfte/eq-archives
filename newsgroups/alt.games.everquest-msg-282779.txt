You might want to read my post before replying to it.  I'm not going
to sit and camp *anywhere* in EQ because I stopped playing it a year
ago.  I still read the posts in the newsgroup because I have fond
memories of some fun times in Everquest.  I'm not complaining that
chanters are underpowered, I'm saying that some of the posters have a
point that EQ seems to remove a class defining ability from chanters.

All that having been said, if I found sitting around and camping
interesting, I'd still be playing EQ.  I don't, so I don't.
