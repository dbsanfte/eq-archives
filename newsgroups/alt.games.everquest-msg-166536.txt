That is a good question.  I did switch the second account over to my billing
informatino when I reinacted it.  Danny, the way to do it is probably to
switch the account over to your billing (pay for one month), wait a few days
for the billing to catch up with them, and then do it.  Such a hassle, but I
guess it makes it harder for people to sell single characters on eBay and
such, as they have to sell the entire account, so that's good.  Thanks for
the thought, Jazz.
