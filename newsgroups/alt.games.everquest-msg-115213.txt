Well... I burned three spells I had in the bank on the FV Druid spell 
lottery, trying to get Egress. What I got instead is Call of Karana, 
Glamour of Tunare, and interestingly enough, Upheaval. Now, since quadding 
in EW will last me for only this level, I was wondering if there is a good 
place to join pick-up AOE groups. I know that Druid AoE cannot compare to 
Wizard or even Mage AOE spells, but 700 damage to an unlimited number of 
targets isn't too shabby either. :)
