Playing a chanter is no way to get your fizzling to stop.  Why is that?  
Because you don't cast spells from most spell lines while playing, oddly 
enough.

Abjuration;  a few buffs and the Tash line.  Won't use this much at low 
levels, so surprise, when you need it, your skill will suck if you just 
relied on it going up on its own.
Alteration goes up just fine; slow, haste, gate, root, you'll use this 
one enough that it won't ever really lag behind.
Divination; needed for sight spells, invis, and illusions, and AE 
stun... which won't be chain cast until higher levels.
Conjuration: pet spell, DOTs, and mez...the former are used but not 
chain cast, pet is once per pet death, DOTs are once per mob death on 
average at best, since chanter DOTs don't stack, and mez won't be cast 
much of the time until higher level; you don't need crowd control much 
at low levels, and when you do, its an emergency, no time for fizzles 
while you hope your skill goes up.
Evocation; nukes and nukes only.  OK, so this line will never be needed, 
only used when you have nothing better to do with your mana and mobs are 
dying too fast to DOT.  Embarassing to start fizzling away at mobs when 
trying to be useful, though.  Or (as I am now) to be slamming 48 point 
nukes into targets in your 30s, because thats the cheap one and you want 
your skill ups on something useful.  Evoc 50 now, yay me.

So instead of worrying about her fizzling away at 24, tell her to do 
what any sensible chanter should, and every few levels go sit in POK and 
chain cast the cheapest versions of her various spells over and over 
again, till her skills go up.  If she does it every level, thats 5 
points each in 4 skills, 3 if she ignores Evocation, probably take 
twenty minutes tops.

I did -not- do this, and now most of my skills are down around 70, with 
Evocation behind at 50 and Alteration waaaaay out in front at 170 or so.
