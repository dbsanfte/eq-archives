I actually agree with you on that... and there is one further point you 
don't mention: Hell levels were an opportunity for lower-level friends to 
catch up with higher-levels.

Still, I have to say, if the point is to add granularity to the XP grind, 
it could have been positive as well as negative. Instead of hell levels 
we could have had "gimp" levels, with low death penalties or where the xp 
flew faster. :)
