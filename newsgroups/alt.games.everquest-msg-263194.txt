It is kind of annoying, I have a very hard time bringing myself to 
destroy certain items, even though they are nodrop, and I know I will 
never use them.  I still have a few pieces of ornate, vindi boots, and a 
few other odds and ends that I have not been able to bring myself to 
destroy yet.

Would not surprise me at all, I am sure I am close to that by now on 
tradeskills as well, and that's just for my main (got my Signet of the 
Arcane), and fletching on my baby wood elf ranger.
