Nope, you did the right thing.

When someone, and especially the Cleric, says RUN then the group is
supposed to RUN!  No debate! No "I think we can take 'em". No delays!
You RUN!

Paw is a prime example of NOT delaying your escape.
Every single time I've gotten killed inside Paw  was because I stayed
back to try and save someone, usually a tank, who just refused to run
and usually got me and someone else killed for it.
Staying behind and not running myself was my own fault. I learned the hard
way that run means RUN right now and NOT after much debate about
whether or not we could handle the adds that triggered the "Run" message.

Mind you, sometimes the tank will tell everyone ELSE to run while he tries
to hold aggro and buy us the time to run.  In that case especially you do
NOT
stay behind to help as he's telling you to run to save the rest of the party
while
he takes the death himself/herself.

When you group up next time remember to ask the leader who calls "run"
and why.  Usually the healer when they are OOM or low on mana and KNOW
they can't save anyone when the adds hit you hard.

hhmmm, actually I have to retract that "every time" I died in Paw statement.
I KNOW I've died twice while trying to run and escape because my personal
sense of direction sucks and I kept running the wrong way and got killed.
