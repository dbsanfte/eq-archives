    Is there any method to his spawning madness? I've heard that killing the
wandering treants will eventually make him spawn and I've also heard that
killing the undead around the spires will too. I've tried both and still no
sign of him. :( I play on Kane Bayle so the population is a bit low for him
to be spotted for me, so, I need to see him myself. Just wondering what you
other Shaman did when you were trying to finish your Totemic BP quest.
