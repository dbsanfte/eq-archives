About 2 pm pacific was the first time I made it on.   I wasn't the first
though, so maybe a half hour before that.

So that would make it about 24 hours.    I can believe thats possible for a
higher geared group than the one in E'ci's Plane of Fire.  And looking at
thier webpage, it seems they're closing in on the final GoD zone, so they
would be higher geared.
