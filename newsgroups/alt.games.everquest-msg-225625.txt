I think a while back, Sony reached the point where it is no longer
"Everquest the game" but rather "Everquest the product family".  I think
there are three stages in the life of an MMORPG:

1. The "Vision" stage.  The game is new.  The developers have in mind
players who want to roleplay and get into the lore of the gameworld.
For the players that do want that, this is a fun time.  However, there will
be lots of bitching from the powergamers and the casual players.

2. The "Fun" stage.  The developers have softened things up.  The vision has
been compromised to make things more fun for a wider group of players.

3. The "Marketing" stage.  The game is making money.  Someone in a suit
noticed, and thought, "hey...those smelly D&D nerds in development stumbled
onto something that has mass appeal, somehow!  Let's put the marketing
people in charge and really squeeze out the bucks!"

EQ is showing strong signs of slipping into #3.
