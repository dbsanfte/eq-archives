The one walk thru I've been able to find for the shaman epic
suggests, cryptically:

    Note: The entire quest is faction based. This means
  that are able to skip the latter parts by doing the first
  ones over and over again until you max your True
  Spirit faction. Once you have max faction, you can go
  straight to Lord Rak'Ashiir and turn in your child's tear.
  However, this can be very time consuming and is not
  recommended.

Well, I got up to the page collection bit on my own (had an alt
do the Black Dire part, but not a raid sized force or anything
like that).  Next step was Lord Ghiosk's books.  So I did that
with my cleric and a partner, and then looted books with shaman
and turned them in too.  Managed to get things cleared out of my
way to get the Icon from under the temple, too.  Then I was
stuck, a trip deep into the Hole wasn't going to happen with a
single group, and I was on the outs enough with my guild to not
go asking them for favors like a raid to help my second alt get
his epic.

Looking back at the paragraph I quoted above, though, there's
some hope; The Hole and what it leads to do nothing but generate
faction hits.  Big ones, I'm sure, but I'm getting faction hits
from pages and from Ghiosk books.

So I'm hanging out in COM whenever I'm not doing anything else,
collecting pages.  And it turns out people kill Lord G for the
exp and have no use for the books, I've done books turn in 4
times and Pages three times.  Finally, I'm Ally.  But not "max
ally."

So in this case, is Ally enough or do I have to keep doing the
quests till I get "this faction can't get any better" messages?

How far, relatively speaking, is the distance from Ally to Max
Ally, anyway, is it the same as from Warmly to Ally, more, less?

Anyone have other walkthru's on the shaman epic I can look at
that might shed more light.

Other than maxing out faction, I need to get into Fear and get an
Iksar Child's Tear.  One group of 65s should be able to kill
Fright, Terror, Dread in order to spawn the Iksar Berserker,
yes?  Just need someone willing to take the DT to pull them.

I've done lord Rak with one cleric one mage both at 60, so I have
little fear of that part, other perhaps than the fact that my
shaman will have to die and then I'll have to log the cleric -in-
to help the mage...
