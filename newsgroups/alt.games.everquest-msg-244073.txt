Sounds a bit like your eqclient.ini file may be borked.  If so the only
suggestion is to delete it and let the patcher redo it.  It will lose
all your hotkeys, messages and screen positions of icons etc though o(

Try copying it to a different place on your harddrive then reload it
from patcher and see if it works .. if not copy the original file back
to the EQ folder.
