I learned a trick some time ago that really helps with this sort of thing.

Step one: /who all LFG 50 60

Step two: look at list, find someone of complimentary class, send them a tell
"want to start a POD group?"

Step three: once you get a hit, send tells to more complimentary classes
"want to join a POD group?"

Step four: once you have a credible force, assemble, buff up, move in.  Don't keep those
people waiting you may lose them.

Step five continue recruiting till group is full, while you fight "yard trash" and get
your force used to working together

Step six: full group, move to a better location.

Step seven: when people need to leave, recruit replacements.

This approach is more work than /lfg on, but it tends to result in groups much faster,
you'd be amazed at how many more people there are who are willing to sit around with the
flag on than there are who are willing to form groups.  Logic suggests the ratio is five
to one, but given the number of LFG people, I'd have to guess its higher still!

Hmm, I forgot, you should also advertise for more group members, hitting POK, POT, and
your target zone, perhaps Nexus too.  Many people, for some reason, don't put the LFG flag
up at all.  Oh, and if you are missing key classes, you may have to /who all class 50 60
and start sending "unsolicited" tells out; lots of those people will be otherwise busy,
but like the old "hey, want to f*ck" plan, if one in ten doesn't slap you, hey, you get
what you need.
