It depends on what class your powerleveling partner is.  At 46 you
have all 3 chants, so you if you can group with someone who can root
easily (long-lasting roots) you become really effecient.  If they can
snare also it becomes trivial.  I would head to Emerald Jungle, park
self and PL partner along the south wall, and use track to find blue
cons.  Pull the mob back to you, have partner root and snare it, and
you start twisting DoTs.  Have partner DoT/nuke as applicable, and
repeat.  The nice thing about this is that if you PL partner hasn't
shown up you, just use a SoW potion and kite the same mobs, it's a bit
slower but still very effecient.
Another good place in the same general area is the goos in City of
Mist.  If your PL partner is a high-level wizard, go into CoM, sit
under the bridge up to the reaver area, turn on manasong, sit while
wizard nukes goos and meds.  A wizard I met said she was able to more
than double her kill rate having a bard there.
