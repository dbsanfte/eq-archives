You're really a disappointment.

I honestly thought you would follow through. Instead, all you seem to be
doing is publicly trolling and ignoring my emails hoping this will all go
away.

Sure, I'll get tired of trying to get you to come through on your offer to
bring me to Florida to kick your ass. Guess I overestimated your character.

TwoHead hit you bullseye when he assessed your character and bravery.

Really disappointing.
