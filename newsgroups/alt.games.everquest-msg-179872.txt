There are three gnome NPC porters in Butcher, TD, FV. They will port
you back and forth. They were added when verant somehow broke the
skiffs from BB to TD boat.

However, whenever the server goes down they do not respawn after it
comes up. You need to petition a GM to respawn these three, Good Luck
on this point, GMs seem scarce these days.
