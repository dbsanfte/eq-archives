I'm even more of newbie than you, Xiphos, and I'm enjoying the responses to
your questions.  Thanks for asking it!

I'm probably doing a more leisurely levelling up than most.  I really enjoy
seeing new territory.  Went on my first LDoN adventure last night.  That
really was an adventure and a half.  Made it to Shadeweaver's Thicket a few
days ago.  Wha?  A mini t-rex?!  Awesome!  A while back (with a character no
longer in existence) I saw my first hill giant (Karana's?).  My jaw
literally dropped when I saw one walking in the distance.  Of course, I had
to run up to it to check it out.  I lived, my husband didn't.  *snicker*
