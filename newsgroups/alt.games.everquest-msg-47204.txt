One more thing about people claiming that gas masks need to be fitted...

It's partially true but not that complicated...

There are 3 sizes...

Small, Medium, and Large...

Small is obviously for children.

Medium is for 70% of the population according to many web sites.

Large is for those who of course have larger hat sizes and large heads.

If you are not sure, call the manufacturers, do not rely on me or anyone
else to advise you.

I am not advising anyone to do anything other than reading some survival
material and stocking up a couple of weeks of provisions...

If you have questions, consult manufacturers and experts.
