>A) The new Zordak Ragefire

Nope, then again I haven't looked

>B) Valdanov Zevfeer

Not personally, but I have seen multiple accounts of people who have
seen him.

>C) Luclin Spells other than Remove Greater Curse and those annoying
>familliars

Yes. Tons of them. Remove Greater Curse ONLY comes from one mob. That
particular mob ALWAYS drops at least 4 spells. Try actually fighting in
appropriate level zones and you can't help falling over spells.

>D) Keys to Vex Thal

Just because it hasn't been found, doesn't mean it's not in-game. Take
the reports for the Seru key. Only 1 guild I've heard of finding them.
Same with Ssara Emp key - only heard of one guild (different one)
successfully completing that key too. The fact that you don't fight in
zones which drop luclin spells leads me to think you've done zero work
on any of these quests yourself.

>D) The Lochness monster.

D) All the answers to everything in a nice easy-to-print format so I
never actually have to work for it.


Ok, maybe I'm being a little hard on you. Some things DON'T exists in
the game and it's very frustrating, but before berating VI (which you
did in a later post) try looking a little harder.

Next you'll be stating the L60 druid spell Moonfire isn't in the game,
but it is, just not in an obvious place...
