I wandered back to Mistmoore yesterday for the first time since
level 30.  I went there back then for my Armor of Ro quests.
I came back yesterday (at level 43) to get my Soulfire hilt,
and was surprised to find that while a lot of things around the
entrance are green, stuff deeper in was blue, easily soloable
(via Paladin melee), and really good exp.

Not sure if I'll stick around, but I was surprised that it
turned out to be a good hunting spot.
