I like to mez mobs as they come in from a pull. Sometimes its hard to target
the mobs at distance, espcially with hills and other obstructions (pets,
players etc). Easy solution...
Hit f9 twice, and then move your camera position up with alt up-arrow. Now
you get a birds eye view and its easy to click on the right mob to mez.
Useful too when you have a horse and the damn head gets in the way.
Speaking of horses, I might just have a quick whine about the fact that you
need to turn on luclin models to use it. Anoying when you multitask, cos the
luclin models use up a lot more memory.
