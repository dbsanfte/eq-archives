I re-rolled anyways. :( But not because of fizzles! I rerolled because of
the whole "aggro on resisted lull" factor...that is one I've *seen* with
my ranger and harmony, and many folks have concurred, so I thought it was 
worthwhile.  A starting charisma of 70 is just...ugh.  That, and I like
buying things cheap at vendors...it's something I carry over from being a
penny pincher IRL.

I'm glad to hear, though, that the fizzle myths are bogus. It's so sad
that in this game the stats mostly do jack-shit.  NO FUN!
