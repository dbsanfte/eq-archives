Hi all,

  I'm a lvl 23 Necro with the utmost "ghetto" equipment.  I've saved up
almost 300PP, not much I know, but what could I possibly get to decently
equip myself at this level?  I played with another lvl 23 necro the other
day who was twinked to the teeth.  It almost wasn't enjoyable to group with
him as he seemed twice as powerful at the same level.

TIA for any advice,
Sharad Sharad
