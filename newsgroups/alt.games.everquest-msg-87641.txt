kk, your system will probably cope well with the old world, kunark and
velious.  Luclin is extremely resource hungry, you could probably run it but
you would have to turn most of the new models off and maybe not load the
texture upgrades for the old world.

To be honest EQ is what you make it.  It's easy to get caught up in the
level-fast-to-get-my-new-skills/spells-so-I-can -level-faster cycle but it
doesn't have to be that way.  My main(1) levelled fast, my alts(2) explore,
quest, roleplay and have fun.  That's not to say my main doesn't have fun,
far from it, I'm just a lot more adventurous with my alts.  There's also a
roleplay server now - incase you wanted to roleplay your characters.  I
think EQ is a very social game.

Hehe, you're in Australia, different timezone.  If you're playing at nights
most people in the US (over 70% of players) will be at work.  Popular
hunting areas and mobs(3) that drop special items are always hard to camp.
EQ, however, encourages grouping - so other people around is a good thing.

Nope.  You talk to folk, find someone nice and ask a few questions. As long
as you aren't rude to people or a newbie begger most people will spare you
the time.  When I first started playing I was surprised how kind everyone
was.  I often go out of my way to help new players.

It's a fun game!

HTH

Bah!
