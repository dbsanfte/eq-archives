i.e. exactly as I explained,

"That's not to say that with excellent gear, like Rangers in excellent
gear, they can't tank, because they can.  But it's not something they're
built to do."

In the same gear tier as a warrior, berzerkers will be far less efficient
tanks.  They need to be geared from higher tiers than warriors in order to
tank as efficiently.

This is no less true for clerics.  The most fun I ever had in WoS was with
a cleric tanking and healing themselves while I played my wizard.  The
tanked very well, held perfect aggro, and never missed a heal, but they
certainly weren't wearing the same gear as a traditional tanking class
would need to be as efficient.
