first dragon!

As Homer Simpson would say "Whoooo Hoooo D'oh!!"
The first dragon raid I went on was Vox and a total success. May I suggest
Vox first, as she dose seem a bit easier to handle. Or maybe it was because
of the organization on the pickup raid. Hmmmm.... Naggy did seem a bit
harder, but not a whole lot. I dunno. I'm rambling.  Hit him again and this
time - kill him! =P  Good Luck!
