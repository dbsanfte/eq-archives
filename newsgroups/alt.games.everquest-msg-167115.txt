Let's see... My guild can handle Golems and Maestro...

}/points jaZZ in the direction of VS,

Yea, we could take him, but we're out of non-epic wizzies.

}Trak,

He kicks our butt.  Then we get to watch some uberguild kill him while 
we're rezzing.

}Lord Bob,

Haven't heard anyone really screaming for any of his loot... what's the 
motive?

}Velk,

My guild took him, but I wasn't there that day.  Sigh.

}Vindi,

Our best attempt so far got him to 40!  We need more clerics.

}Statue,

Well, if we can't do Vindi...

}Vaniki, Zlandikar

Maybe when we're done with HoT.

Was there a theme to this list?  I don't see where being able to do fear 
and hate implies a guild is ready for any of these...
