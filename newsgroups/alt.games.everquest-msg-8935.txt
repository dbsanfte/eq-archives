But seriously, it's a shame you apparently don't have much intention of
creating an enchanter.

It's amazing how much more you learn about the game when you get different
characters up to level 20 or so.

I guess it's THE biggest good thing I can say about folks who can't seem to
stick to one class.  I have 8 different classes that are 17+, and I've
learned so much about the other classes when I play them.

I find it hard to believe anyone when they say "I stick with one class, will
learn to play it well, and play it forever."  I don't believe it's POSSIBLE
to learn to play ANY class well when they don't have any experience with
others.

It sounds like you know how to be a warrior pretty well at your level (I'm
thinking it's low 20s tops, if I remember correctly).  There are very few
really good enchanters until at LEAST level 20 because there's a hell of a
lot to learn about the class.  When you start grouping with older enchanters
that aren't afraid to get hit I'm confident that your role will change.

I have a level 17 rogue and 20 monk.  Those are my only melee.  I can easily
and honestly say that - although there's things to remember - they're a
piece of cake compared to any caster but wizard (I have a 30 wizzie).
Wizards are easier than melee, though you wouldn't think so, considering the
number of bad ones out there.

Enchanters and bards require the most thinking.  No, seriously, give either
a try.

Quick run-down of my characters, in order of remembering (2 accounts, same
server):

51 enc
49 dru
30 wiz
26 mage
25 bard
20 monk
17 rogue
22 cleric
6 shammie
4 necro (I keep starting him over...DE to Iks, to DE, etc...can't make up my
mind. I will probably remake him as a gnome 'cause gnomes are the greatest
at everything ;))

Hmm, I'm forgetting 2...they're probably below 10.

I'm not bragging...honestly it's pretty pathetic on two counts.  First, 51
is the highest after over 2 years?  Secondly, that pretty much PROVES that I
have no life.  I'm just giving the info to let you know that I think I'm
qualified to make the statements in this post.
