Yalp.  Http://www.yalp.org

NIce breakes it down to partie members, click on them to see how there
damage wqas done. (ie magic, slash, bash, kick...) Click on your name under
the Parties tab, and you can see everything you did during that log sesion.
It alows you to search your log for "text" enteries. ( ie. All guild chat,
Tells form Kearmit Dfroag....)

When you get ready to start a new battle you can turn on the monitor to see
realtime damage of everyone, including the mobs.  Broken down to offensive
damage output, offensive DPS, Defensive damage, and defensive DPS.  ( watch
the mob to see howmuch damage the hole partie is doing.)

One cavet is that like all other Log PArsers it will not show the real magic
damage for everyone.  ONLY DIRECT DAMAGE will ever show.  There is no way
with the curent way SOE sends info to your log to tell how much damage that
DOT done by the necro did.  THe one that runs and reports from inside EQ
(eqwatcher) if I remember corectly, when set up right for your class can
tell what damage YOUR dots do, even taking into acount focus effects.  I
haven't been able to get it to work for me, but i THink it was a lac of
prossesor power.  when I get my new machine I will try again.

Hope this helps you deside on a parser.  I like yalp because I can try out
diferent weppon combo's and not have to split the log all the time.  YOu can
just hit reset on the monitor window.
