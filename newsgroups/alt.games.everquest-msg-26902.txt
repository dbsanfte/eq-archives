Yeah, I've given up trying to explain to people what the
difference is (or at least is supposed to be).

A lot of folks couldn't even grasp the concept after I had
explained it.  Even with examples, (e.g. "Look, your
character would certainly ask for directions if he was
lost, so /shout is fine for 'can anyone tell me where
the druid's guild is', but he wouldn't even know the
existence of computers, so asking 'what's wrong with my
video card' should be in /ooc"), I'd still get back,
"huh?"

Remember, these same folks are probably often behind
the wheel of a car...
