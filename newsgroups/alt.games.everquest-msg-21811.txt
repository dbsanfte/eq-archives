Well I don't MIND getting hit - it's the lack of another healer's loving 
touch I'm missing :)  And I THOUGHT I was safe since we had another 
shaman along as well ;)

But yes, tanks are good.  Less downtime since they don't have to heal as 
often, obviously... I mean I've been on both sides of the coin.  Groups 
with not enough tanking power, groups with too much.  (And wow, can the 
latter ever be THE penultimate (sp?) testosterone-fest. *g* "You're at 
20%! I'm oom!" "Don't care! Must kill beast! Must bring home scalp and 
prove self to woman!")
