Clipping is set to 50%. Anything more and I get "stutters" when
running around a zone. I will do more detailed testing tonight.

I am using the x3dfx drivers (They promist full DX8 support):

I have only gone to the Nexus and the Bazaar with the VD5. I will head
over to Shadow Haven, and see how things are. It sounds like a good
zone for power testing graphic settings.

Cheers
