In many ways then, the suicide bombers are very similar to the kamikaze
(remember, even the word means divine wind, reverse the order, and you've
got a wind god).  A few terrorists in an American aircraft did much more
damage than they could have in a conventional way.  We have much better
military equipment than any islamic country.  The people of islamic nations
are also brainwashed to believe that we will destroy them, after all, we're
in league with Isreal, who uses the blood of muslim teens to make matza
(sp?) bread, or so the Islamic media says.  And, Bin Laden sought to cow
America, a nation he thought to be too weak-willed to fight back.  The
parallels are very strong.  The difference is that the Japanese fought for
their nation, while the terrorists "fought" for a religion that has been
seriously de-railed by those who would use it for their own purposes.

As far as the GI that shields his friend from the grenade, I don't see it as
being similar.  The GI is using his body to shield his friends, so yes, he
is giving up his life for others, but it is purely a defensive move.  The
kamikaze-tachi, and terrorists are offensive weapons.  The GI is acting out
of self-sacrifice, and love for his friends, the terrorist is only acting
out of hatred for his enemy.
