All of the rogue type skills raise very quickly either in melee, or with a
little practice so it's not really worth putting a lot of practice points on
any of them.  I think I would just hang on to them.  Maybe at higher levels
you will find a really good use for them. Keep your fingers crossed that
with all the "fixing" going on, that poisons will finally get the fix they
need to be a part of the game.  Then you might find a use for those points.
