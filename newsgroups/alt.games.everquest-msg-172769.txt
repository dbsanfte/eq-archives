Rumble, I've read your posts with moderate interest (even though I disagree
with you) until you made this statement and a couple others like it.  You
are one of those people I can't stand -- people who think that because
they've never seen it done it's WRONG.  You're the same as people who'll say
that modern music isn't music because the classical artists didn't do it
like that, or that modern architecture isn't architecture because they've
never seen any classical architecture that looks like it.  I'm not even
addressing the subject of whether the nickname "wizzie" is artistically
pleasing -- that's entirely a matter of opinion -- but I *am* pointing out
how stupid you are to say that it's not ok simply because "these terms were
not coined in the fantasy world in any fiction of this genre I've ever read.
It is an alteration by players."  In other words, because you've never seen
it published it's wrong.
