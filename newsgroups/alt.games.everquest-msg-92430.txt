When ever I'm running around and see a corpse, I send a /tt to it to
see if they online.  These ones are free.  Also helping CR for another
group in the same zone is always free if I can get my group to help
out.

I used to never charge for rez, but after trying to get to a raid and
having to auction 100p for a port every time I got fed up.  Blame the
wizzies and druids =)

Usually I'll travel a few zones if 100p is offered in the first tell
sent to me and I don't know you.  This is peridot money $

In general, if I don't know you or your guild:

corpse in another zone? I am busy.
can't take the time to spell out plz? I am busy.
you are anon? (and usually a porter /grin), I am busy.

One way to make me go out of my way if I am available is to speak to
me in my native tongue, which is dark elf.  I like that =)

This is from a  lev 60 cleric /w epic's perspective.  I am usually
raiding, exping, or helping guildmates when online, or on my way to do
one of those.  So being busy is 99% truthful =)
