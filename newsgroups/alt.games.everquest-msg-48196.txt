The ranger option suffers exactly the same pitfalls as the stopwatch
option. If your ranger doesn't hit his track every couple minutes, then you
get the same amount of warning.

Plus, I'd much rather have a notice every 5 minutes from someone with a
watch than a "PoGs INC NOW!" with a 2 minute lead time from a ranger.

Anywhere in the zone that you wipe out from, to a safe place to come back
and collect bodies. Trying to zone in a whole raid and loot bodies before
the PoGs arrive if you were at the northmost smurf village is a VERY
effective way to double your corpse count (since the PoG spawn point is
about a 15 second run from the north smurf village).

The treants do, but the wisps spawn randomly up the east hillside. I
haven't been on a PoG raid in some time, but I can never remember a wisp
trying to gate...the treants do, and so do most of the tiki men.
