From the shadows, the mysterious Mudfish <mew@mewmew.com> (if that IS
his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

>I know better than to make any final statements (and trust me, my stuff 
>isn't worth a CIHYS :)), but it's possible that Horizons may be able to do 
>what Asheron's Call, Asheron's Call 2, Ultima Online, Anarchy Online, 
>Shadowbane, Dark Age of Camelot, and Final Fantasy XI couldn't.

Don't bet on it.

Horizons just hangs a stick in front of you and hopes you'll mistake
