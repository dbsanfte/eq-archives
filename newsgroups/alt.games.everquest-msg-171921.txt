It's not the nicknames themselves that I take as much issue with as
the tendency for people to come up with them for no aparent reason.
Name a few if this genre of literature is full of them. I'm betting
that any you might think of had a perfectly logical reason for being
coined. These nicknames I take exception to are not a contribution to
the intended atmosphere. I can't think of any such uses in any of the
credible works I have read.

Fantasy characters would have as much imagination as the rest of us, I
would imagine. However, it really has nothing to do with their
imagination. It has everything to do with people looking for some cool
alternative to an ordinary yet more correct term. I make the
comparison to MTV or X-generation because I see the same thing there.
New language for existing objects and ideas for no reason other than
trying to be "more fresh" than the next person.
