    This is my #1 big time regret for having left EQ.  But as long as I
keep hanging around age, well, then I haven't totally left at all, now have
I?  I've heard it said before that newsgroup is harder to quit than the
actual game is, and I believe that.  

   I actually have mixed feelings about staying in the newsgroup, too. 
I've seen many examples in the EZboard network and to some extent in this
newsgroup (though age does have retired posters who manage to still be on
topic and interesting) of hanger-ons who have left the game but continue to
offer their views on it, usually from a very negative viewpoint.  I've
often felt that such posters were doing little more than adding to the
noise ratio.  And I know that with every patch and little change to the
game, my personal experiences, though they lasted for four years, become
less and less relevant to the game as it is played today.
