Before they nerfed Pet Canni, the 'improved' pet canni AA for mages
broke their ability to canni pets.  I believe it was all the mages
bitching about the fact they took it and couldn't get it reimbursed
when thye found out what it actually did to them that was a major
reason for the whole revamp.  The fact that there was another
expansion planned to increase levels (and therefore mage pets) was
also a major factor too.
