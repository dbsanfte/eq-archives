You haven't posted anything that indicates you have insider
information.

Where have you been that last few weeks? All of the regulars in this
group predicted emergency patches and repeated server crashes. Hell
anyone who has played EQ for more than 6 months would expect no less
from a major patch.

100K online is 100K online. Verant makes no distiction between
multiple account holders. A paying account is a paying account.

You have not posted 1 single fact that only an EQ employee would know.
Where is this "truth" you are dispensing?

LOL! We (the players) never did have a say.

Not surprising since EQ is several years old now, and raking in 400K+
subscribers. It is perfectly logical that the execs at Sony are
interested in the "next big thing". Especially since it is unproven
and costing a lot of money to produce.

Oooh is that supposed to be insider information? It was posted
publically by REAL VI/Sony employees that PoP would be the last
expansion seen before the launch of SWG or EQ2 weeks/months ago. 

Again not suprising. If either game pulls away a large portion of the
current EQ player base, then it will be a clear indication that EQ is
winding down. If the number of EQ subscribes holds steady, I would be
willing to bet money that we will see new content and possibly another
expansion.

That same "tired bastard" will have to watch over the EQ2 and SWG
servers as well. So I don't see your point. If you are trying to
assert that Sony will one day drop support for EQ, then pat yourself
on the back. You have come to the same conclusion that any objective
person with an ounce of common sense could plainly see.

GMs "wander" between servers not zones. But since you work for VI/Sony
you should know the difference. 

>SO when you read something i post, don't just dismiss it as "crap",

When it stops being crap (or old news), I will stop dismissing it.
Nothing you have posted even comes close to indicating that you work
for VI/Sony.

>Forgive them Father for they know not what they play..

Forgive him father for he know not what he is talking about....
