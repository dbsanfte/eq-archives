As name-policy rabid as I am, I'm pretty sure Mezzmer isn't against
the policy. Sure, it's not exactly the height of creativity, but still
not petitionable.

I don't know about the server you're on, but it's been my experience
that most players consider that spot a FFA fight. KS seems to be the
standard there.

Now, that would be a valid petition to make. Of course, nothing will
really come of it - a GM or Guide might eventually show up and tell
everyone to play nice. Maybe.

About the best thing you could have done, assuming you didn't have the
firepower to keep your kills, would have been to simply move on. Some
battles aren't worth fighting.
