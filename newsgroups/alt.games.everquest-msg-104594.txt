Accualy I do research consumer affairs aticals on the stuff I buy my son. As
for jump ropes - there is a line of common sence:

Is my child the type to stay online for hours on end?
Do I want to encourage this behavior?
I see a referance to "EverCrack" - wtf is that about?
etc etc

there are lables on Cigs that say (simplafied) "smokeing is bad for you"
most of the responces you get are "no shit - gata light?"

what is the EQ lable going to say?
 "If you or your child have an adictive personality, then do not play this
game"
 Most people at this point will have more problems then playing EQ.

EQ was just the last straw with that guy, it would have been something else
if not EQ, probaly drugs (including booze) but whos to say. Its sad he is
dead - more to the point that he thought his life sucked so bad in the mean
time.I think his EQ habbit was merly a simptom of what we know was a larger
problem. Putting a lable on EQ is mearly curing (or attempting to cure) the
simptom while ignoring the true problem at hand - mental health.

The lables will do nothing, mabey eaven have the "taboo" effect and make
Sony some money.
