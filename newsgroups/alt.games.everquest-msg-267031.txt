And this is bad how? If they'd done what you want then EQL would be totally
supplanted by EQ2. How does that draw in new business? Those that don't
like EQL's methods now probably won't like an extension of EQL. It's about
choice. They're catering to two different tastes now instead of one
(barring Planetside, SWG, et al.).
