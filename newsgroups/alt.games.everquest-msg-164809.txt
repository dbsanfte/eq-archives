No, you couldn't. No single buff or even set of buffs gives such a
huge boost to soloing at mid to high levels. No good gear can DOUBLE
the xp speed of a soloing druid/wizard/etc. KEI is *GROSSLY*
overpowered. While I don't expect a nerf to hit it any time soon, I
can't say I'll be surprised if it does.

Even cutting the duration of KEI would go a long way towards remedying
this problem. Part of the reason KEI is so high-demand is someone can
get buffed with it then not even have to think about it for a couple
hours. Do you really think people would be depending so heavily on it
if it faded every half hour or so?
