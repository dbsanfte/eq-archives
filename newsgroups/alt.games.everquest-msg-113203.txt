At these low levels, and with no real penalty for death, theres no
need to mem a passle of spells on death.  If you are deliberately
using death to PL yourself, just mem the one or two you need
for your strategy and you are back on your freshly HP and Mana
regenned butt ready to go.

Particularly interesting are the various camps where you can get
someone to bind you right next to your fight, like GFay or the
various mines in cities around Norrath

The down side is that death erases any high level buffs you may
have glommed, making this strategy oddly more successful for
the relative newb PLing himself than for a level 60 making an alt
tool quick.  Course that alt tool in full twink gear with level 49
HP/AC buffage and regen and a DS isnt' going to need to do
anything but porcupine like mad anyway.
