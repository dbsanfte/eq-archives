Well now that luclin is just around the corner it looks like im gonna have
to finally upgrade my old beast of a PC.

I'm looking for a good CPU/MOBO/RAM configuration.
I would like to buy it as a prebuilt bare bones system in a new case as
installing a new MB could be quite aggrivating in my current case. plus
there are soooo many types of mobo/ram/cpu its hard to know if it will work.

Anyways my current config is

PII-300
192 MB RAM
25 GB HD (2 hard drives)
32MB Video card
SBLive!

I would like to get a nice P4 box and just move all my components over to
the new one. Can anyone give any advise on this I have been searching the
net all night and the options are just mind boggling!
