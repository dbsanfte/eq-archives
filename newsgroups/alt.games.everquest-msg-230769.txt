No you need the other classes as you need people who can make the
other parts.

This was hosed by the bazaar. I like you stopped when I got to the
point of needing the other classes.  Of course the zone has also had a
fair change since SoL came out too, there used to be lvl 14 odd
owlbears near the fort, and my bst lvl'd there, those owlbears dont
seem to be around any more. That and everone around that lvl there was
in PC.
