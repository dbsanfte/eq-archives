LOL this is hilarious, in a sad sort of way. <g>

Anyway, in answer to your question, see www.allakhazam.com under Bestiary by
Zone.  But here's some info I c&p'd from there.

She's on a different faction from any or mostly any NPC in FV.

Critters you can kill to LOWER faction:
A Greater Spirit
Bondl Felligan
Camin
Glaron the Wicked
Joshua
Kaiaren
Kinlo Strongarm
Mairee Silentone
Nadia Starfeast
Tenal Redblade
Teydar
Tykar Renlin

Zones where you find the above critters (not in any particular order, as far
as I know)

Qeynos Aqueducts
Fironia Vie
Eastern Karana
Trakanon's Teeth
Erudin
Kaladim North
Erudin Palace
Freeport North
Freeport East
Rathe Mountains
Freeport West

See that page on allakhazam for ideas if you want to raise faction with her.
