    Hmmm yeah, should crunch numbers before posting assertions like that. On
the other hand putting forth something that people can argue with is what
makes for discussions in the first place.

    My only excuse is that I haven't been 48 for a long time and didn't take
very long thinking about the post. I also play an SK, and get less out of
STA and less hp to start with than warriors :)

    Thinking back now I do recall being somewhere near the 4k hp mark,
although maybe only 3500hp, in my late 40's shortly after stumbling on a
raid in kith ;)

    And something like the fact that your average 40's tank loses some
relative HP in their early 50's to increase their AC was also far from my
mind. Justin's 925AC is nothing to sneeze at, at 48 - but way under par for
planar mobs. I believe my AC unbuffed in my late 40's was barely over 800 :/
And in my early 50's I was stuck with an 840AC tank [solo fear kiting is
great up to a point] and ended up sacrificing a fair bit of STA, HP and
other stats to get it up over 1k... am 1118 unbuffed at 58! (but luckily
about to embark on another serious gear upgrading binge)

    The other thing that probably threw me off is that I haven't bothered
with virtue myself for a couple of weeks, and have been typically just over
3k with shammy buffs. (have discovered the shammy/sk deadly duo)

Cheers,
James
