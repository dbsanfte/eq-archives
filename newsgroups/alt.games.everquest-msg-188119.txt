Hi all,

A while back I purchased the level 24 pet spell for a necro (500 PP Argh!) 
I'm quite content with it, but every time  I see another necro thats a 
lower level then me with a pet, their pet is *bigger* then mine.
And they're using the level 20 pet. Has anyone else noticed this ??
Its kinda funny, having a higher level pet, that looks smaller in 
comparison too lower level pets.

Not that it matters TOO much anymore since I attained level 29 last night, 
while laying waste to the poor mutants in the Echo Caverns....
