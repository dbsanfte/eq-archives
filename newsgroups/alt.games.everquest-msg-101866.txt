I'm pretty sure LOIO has been hit with a negative modifier. Bloodgill 
goblins appear to be of a slightly higher level than Frost Giant Scouts 
(bloodgills are mostly dark blue to me, with a few light blues, while 
Giants are mostly light blue with a few dark blues), and yet my XP bar 
seemed to move a lot faster in Great Divide. This has happened to me 
twice already, the feeling that my xp is going nowhere at the bloodgill 
camp.
