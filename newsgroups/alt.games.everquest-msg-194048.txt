    Then let me help a little more. The best loot guide I know is at
www.silentredemption.org - it has errors, but they usually aren't massive
errors. From that lootguide, here's the easier stuff.

PLANE OF FIRE: Fiery Spirit Equine, Jopal Seer, Doomfire Warlord, Captain of
Fire, Sorceror of Fire, General Reparm, Doomfire Firecharmer, Obsidian Tree
Spider Queen, and Flame Overlord are all one-groupable mini-nameds that can
spawn in place of regular mobs. Criare Sunmane, Jaxoliz Dawneyes, General
Druav Flamesinger are non-elemental droppers that are on three day timers.
Magmaton, Pyronis, Quavonis Firetail, Babnoxis the Spider Queen, and Blazzax
the Omnifiend are all elemental mold droppers, on three day timers. All
elemental mold droppers, or the rings that spawn them, are on three day
timers.

PLANE OF AIR: the non-elemental droppers are Baltador the Cursed, Melernil
Faal'Armanna, Queen Silandria, Calebgrothiel, Rinturion Windblade, Arch Mage
Alchtonion, Inlocher the Warlord, Chamberlain Escalardian, Gakamenial
Fir'Disralsi, and Lossenmacher. There are other named non-elemental
droppers, but they are spawned as part of the process to spawn the elemental
droppers in the zone (Avatars of Wind, Smoke, Dust, and Mist).

PLANE OF WATER: the non-elemental droppers are Swordfang, Triloun Seer,
Savage Deepwater Kraken, Razorfin, A Toughened Anglerfish, Monstrous Sea
Turtle, Triloun Egg Keeper, Regrua Overlord, and others which I cannot
remember. The elemental droppers are Grioihin the Wise, Krziik the Mighty,
Ofossaa the Enlightened, and Hydrotha.

PLANE OF EARTH: elemental droppers are spawned by completing the rings, so
you won't bumble into them. Tantisala Jaggedtooth is the crocodile that
guards the way to the guy that drops the EarthB key (Mystical Arbitor). The
mini-nameds are Tribal Leader Diseranon, A Prismatic Basilisk, Calris
Bristlebranch, The Living Earth, A Pristine Gem Golem, A Korascian Warlord,
amongst others.

    Enjoy!

    James
