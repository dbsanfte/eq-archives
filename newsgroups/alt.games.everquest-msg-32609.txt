Probably because the buff names would overlap in an unreadable
clutter, especially if you had rearranged your "buff box"
to be a single long, horizontal row like I do.  Even a
3x5 box would probably overlap a lot of the "buff labels".

But that would still be better than having to right-click-and-hold
on each and every buff.  I don't care if it's ugly.
