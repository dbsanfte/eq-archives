There's a message on the Sony Newbie Zone board from somebody claiming
that all the new GB quest skellies in Najena have been pulled except the
one in the freezer. Can anyone confirm or deny this? I'm currently in
Rathe Mtns. and don't feel like jogging all the way back there to find
out, but I'm certainly curious, as I was pretty sure they were going to
do that for a number of reasons.
