I'm not sure the state of the Xev economy is public knowledge
already...haven't heard it mentioned here.  Just wanted to throw this out,
though, as a very good reason why cracking down on using exploits to get
cash is not a bad thing.

Aproximately one week before LDoN went live, or perhaps right after it,
Xev had an odd little bug.  Sharks (that's right, big fish with fins) were
dropping millions of platinum each.  So much platinum, gold, and silver
that the person looting it would crash to desktop.  But they were able to
come back in and waddle to the bank, then go back for another shark.

In one night, every high end piece of gear was bought.  Vendors woke up to
an amazing profit.  

GMs of course came to clean up the mess, deleting all of the "shark money"
and items purchased with shark money, and rolling back some vendors.  BUt
they couldn't catch everything.  Shark money is still jingling around on
Xev.  And high end items were deleted from our world.  IMagine the
pre-nerf circlet's of shadow completely gone forever and cry, like I do
when I remembered we sold one for 9k back during Luclin's release.  Add a
1 before the 9 and 0 after it and maybe I could buy one now.

Combine this with the release of LDoN, and people who no longer farm runes
and ornate, and you have a drastic lack of high end gear on our server,
yet a lot of people with INSANE amounts of platinum. The only thing
selling reasonably is LDoN gear.  For a while the economy appeared to be
recovering, then it took a wild hike again...it is rumoured that someone
is "releasing shark money" slowly into our economy.

I am now on teh server with possibly the highest prices of any server, and
it's only likely to get worse.  This isn't exactly a whine, because I am
still a golden child...managed to find my ornate boots for 35k when they
are going for 100k+...ornate sleeves for 65k when they are going for
150k+...the gods must love me enough to shield me from the pain of this
situation.  But the bazaar, every night, is filled with cries of "OMFG,
that is so overpriced!" and the 10 replies of "blame the sharks and suck
it up".

So yeah, I was annoyed when they killed the cheese vendor, but I think I
understand now.  And children, if you ever think your server's economy
sucks...just be glad you aren't on Xev. O_O

(If the shark's hit other servers too, I apologize for thinking we're
unique...but I've not heard it mentioned here, so I have to assume we
are.)
