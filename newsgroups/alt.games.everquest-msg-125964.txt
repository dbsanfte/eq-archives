I'm beginning to wonder where the young ronin is as well.  I've seen the AC,
Terrorantula, and Sandgiant Husam each two more times than I've seen him
(never), and there's no way I can be missing him with "enhanced track."
http://www.packetlost.com/ho/eq/sro/ says that he is on the rare cycle with
the rest of them, but either he's perma-despawned (read: the live team
screwed up again), I have really bad luck, or there is some really weird way
of spawning him that I have never tried.
