I have Escape on my main rogue, and the ONLY thing I can say about it is
that I hate the long timer on it.  I wish they would add that in 9 more AA
levels
or something you could halve the timer and then in 9 more halve it again.
Would be great for keeping the rogue around for CR in a wipeout, sorta like
the early days in Sebilis when everybody was level 51 and no maps or
anything was about.  Keeping the rogue hidden until pathing and stuff
was figured out saved lots of time on CR :-).

Yeah, and the main thing about rogue damage is backstab.  If you don't
get back shots, no backstab.  If you have a LONG run of crappy numbers with
the RNG, you might as well have no backstab (my alt rogue is now main-
hand stabbing for a max of 92, and her min backstab is 84...I hate seeing
"pierce x 2 for 92 followed by a backstab of 84...sheesh :-)  ).

Heh, it's an old habit from Naggy/Vox/Sev days. Really keeps down
the ninja looting when your rogues and now MB wizards are
grouped together and can loot the droppable stuff immediately.
