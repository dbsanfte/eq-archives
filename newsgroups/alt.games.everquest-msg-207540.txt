Hmm here's an idea: when the mob:player ratio drops below a certain level,
Zone wide warnings about the Children of Zek are issued, then 1 min later
everyone get's pvp flagged till they leave zone or the general population
drops enough.
You could even get fancy and tie it to parsing the shouts/occs... :P
I think it's better than AC's auto portal system, myself. More interesting
anyway.

Man I'd be an asshole game dev wouldn't I?
