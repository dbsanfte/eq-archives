I don't know why everyone is so against Verant's Customer Service.  Although
I have had some problems with it, like timeliness, it still worked for me in
the long haul.  In game their CS is very good.  Outside the game their
service is a bit slow, but still effective.  I've never used their number,
because I don't feel like paying for something i could handle thru email or
in game.  An 800 number would be nice.

The hositility against people trying to help you and be friendly and working
for free (at least guides) seems a bit silly, and you really should be
grateful for their time and energy in trying to help you better experience
EQ.

I don't accept the EQ CS sucks.  Saying that they don't care about their
game or customer support seems a bit silly also, considering the constant
upgrading and new stuff coming out.  If they don't care about their
customers eventually they will alienate them, which could effect their
bottom line in the future.  I don't think they want this to happen.
