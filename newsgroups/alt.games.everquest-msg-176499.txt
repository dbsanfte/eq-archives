Yes. Soloed about 80% of the time.

Can be good damage dealers early on. Later, can be useful for buffs and 
and DoT's. The Spiritual spells are pretty cool too. Mana and HP group 
regen.

Funnest toon I have.

I mostly work on Wis, but I play a pet cleric. If you plan on fighting 
side by side with your pet, work on Str too.

Instead of a scawny pet poping into the zone with you and you have to 
buff it, you now have a spell that casts a buffed pet. Then you just 
have to add speed and procs.

items and easy leveling. Although I have a Barbarian that was a lot of fun.

Keep your H2H skill up, and try to raise your spell skills evenly. At 
54, I fight bare handed and deal a pretty good amount of damage...until 
I finish my epic. :)
