If I had played WoW first, without years of experience in EQ, I probably
would never have played EQ.  It's a good game.  But it's too much like EQ,
so there's nothing "new and big" to hook me (and the challenge level is just
"off", as I got a character to level 60 in the first month it was out
*while* leading a "hardcore" raiding guild in EQ).
