I found the missions and skirmishes rather dull, while the strong storyline
made a nice change from other RTS I thought WC3 had nothing new to offer.

But it wasnt until I started looking at the scenario's that I really started
to enjoy the game.
 The game ships with some fun ones that are great for playing over a LAN but
http://maps.warcraftiii.net/listmaps.php?type=08 has a good choice of
downloadable ones.

The heavier reliance on your heros and less on swarms of lesser units (In
many of the RPG scenarios you only have heros) makes for a very
Diablo/Dungeon seige feel but set in the warcraft world.
