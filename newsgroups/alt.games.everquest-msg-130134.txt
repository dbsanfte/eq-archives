Laziness owns me, and I don't feel like going through the bullshit I did for
my first one.  Not like I exactly have a lot to spend money on anyways,
everything's either incredibly expensive (40k +) or not useful to me.

On first earring:

Picnic, made myself, total cost ~ 50pp (had foraged stuff and brownie parts
already)
Pie, 750pp, avg price at time
Cabbage, traded 6 wild cabbages and 5 unimbued plains pebbles for
Stein traded 2 iron oxide for
Idol traded 12 iron oxide for (and realized afterwards it was way too many,
I could've done more like 5 and still gotten it)
Robe traded 5 stacks of silk swatches and 3500 for (guy was selling lots for
5k each)
Sickle, 3kpp
Pole got free combine for component from robe supplier, pain in the ass
though because I had enough for 2 combines in case of a failure, but I
didn't bring the tackle box and had to go back out, tried to get it in OOT,
but the broken boat dumped me on Allizewsaur who killed me when I went LD,
ended up getting the tackle box in WK instead.
Champagne paid 300 for to a guy who got given 4 of them for a port.

Totals out to around 8300pp cash, 5 stacks of silk swatches and 14 iron
oxides.  However, I then sold my last 7 iron oxides to a guy who was buying
them for his guilds full scale outfitting effort for 500 each, slashing 3500
off that price, down to 4800.  The reason I was so loose with the oxides on
the idol is mostly because I'd had them on my tradeskill mule since back
when the only thing they were good for was smithing dyes and I'd found a
stack on a gnome newbie vendor (then I bought 1 more from a newbie in
Steamfont about 2 days before the earring was upgraded to it's current form
for 5pp)
