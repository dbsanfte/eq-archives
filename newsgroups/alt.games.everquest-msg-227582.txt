Sounds like corrupt texture cache files. Run a search for everything
ending in .txc. EQ texture cache files are all that should come up.
Delete them all. (If by some off chance something comes up that's not
in your Everquest directory, leave it alone) When you log back into
EQ, the txc files will be re-made as needed. This usually fixes this
sort of problem when it comes up.
