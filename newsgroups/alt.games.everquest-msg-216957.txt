Several reasons:

- First, and foremost, I'm a naturally crabby person. Can't be helped.
- Second, my experiences with LDoN really did piss me off, which is in
rather stark contrast to what playing a game is about.
- Third, I've returned to college and the experience has been far from
overwhelmingly positive. I expect to deal with ignorance in an EQ
newsgroup, for example, but I admit to being surprised at how much
exists in the classroom.
- Fourth, I've put in several really long programming days recently,
12-14 hours, which leaves me mentally exhausted. This just enhances
the first problem in a geometric fashion.
