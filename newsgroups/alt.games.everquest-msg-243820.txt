I had something like this happen to me and after much agony over it
was able to fix it by deleting all the character files and client
config files on my computer (all files that have your character names
in them and eqclient.ini). Something in those files would crash my
computer every time I logged in. Also, if you use a custom UI, delete
it and try starting EQ again. I've had problems with my custom UI
several times.
