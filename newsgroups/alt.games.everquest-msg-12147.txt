Glide, if you have a Voodoo card and the games supports Glide use it.
Glide is the API specifically designed for use with Voodoo cards, it
works with no other card.  It's usually faster and better qual than D3D
(on a voodoo that is).

D3D sacrafices performance for compatability.  It tries to work with all
3D accelerators.
