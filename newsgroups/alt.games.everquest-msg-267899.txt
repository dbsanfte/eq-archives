I think its random as to whether or not the skill increases at use, and it 
becomes
more difficult the closer you are to max. You may be having a bit of bad 
luck.
I've found sometimes I get several skill increases in a row, and then go for
long stretches without getting an increase at all. I do not think the skills 
depend
on each other in any way.

Some classes do not start with all the equipment, so they have
to buy a fishing pole, or mining axe, etc.  I know the mage class starts
with all of them right off the boat. However, my guess is that there are
"advanced" fishing poles, etc available later on.

Not sure, but that is a good idea.  I think I'll do the same if I can.
