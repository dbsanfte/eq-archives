Weight only affects your AC (Armor Class) unless you are heavier than
your strength rating. At which point you become encumbered, and suffer
other ill effects. When you exceed the Monk weight limit you lose AC,
and you will get hit more often and take more damage in a fight.

As a monk your needs will be few. The life you have chosen is one of
sacrifice and discipline. The biggest advantage to being a monk is
that you are not "Equipment Dependant" like a Warrior. A naked monk is
80% as effect as a fully clothed/armored one. Over your lifetime you
will spend far less than any other class when it comes time to buy
equipment.
