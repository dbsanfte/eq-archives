Someone suggested a while ago that being flamed by Bizbee is a
requirement for a.g.e initiation - does this mean I'm finally in? :p

And no, that's not why I wrote that. Getsumj is not Hitler, a rapist,
a murderer, or even pocket avenger (even though he might have been
responsible for bringing the latter here). Even though most won't,
some trolls *will* try to redeem themselves so I'm judging him on a
post by post basis the same way I judge you on a post by post basis
and thankfully, I identify with neither of you.

Besides, I think we can invoke Godwin now. Thank you. Just remember
this thread the next time you complain about being flame followed
around the newsgroup, because that is what you're asking for for
someone else here.

(Notice this thread didn't even resemble a kernel of a flame war until
a bunch of regulars decided to get selfrighteous on getsumj's ass?)
