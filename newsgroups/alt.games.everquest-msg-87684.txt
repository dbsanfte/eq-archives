3 pet classes and a bard :)

I'd love to see a group where the bard pulls, slows, and
does an all instrument attack, while the pets eat the mob
alive :)

I've had the pleasure of duo'ing my mage with a BL, the
two pets just chewed up mobs.  I'd definitely go with a
mage in the mix, sometimes the ability to burn a mob down
fast is just invaluable.
