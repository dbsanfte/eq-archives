Stupid question here, but since I got into the game just before PoP was 
released, I think it somewhat valid.  

PRIOR TO PoP, was there anyway - without paying for a port - for a newbie 
to go from Luclin to we, ANYWHERE else?  I've never stuck with a kitty 
long enough to find out, and haven't gone to Luclin otherwise (no, not 
even to the bazarre(sp?)!)

Just curious, and not taking sides in this issue.
