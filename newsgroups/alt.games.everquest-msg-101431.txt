You got wiped out with *two* druids in the group? I've soloed *three* HGs 
at the same time in RM (of course, at 45, with the ES free DoT)... 
Perhaps you wouldn't have the combined firepower to take down all the 
adds, but man, with two druids and an enchanter what you aren't short of 
is crowd control capabilities. At the very least, you should all have 
been able to make it to the zone.

I don't know much about fighting in dungeons, but if you need money, I 
would suggest trying a to pick up a group in a level-appropriate dungeon. 
Outdoors sucks mightily for money, take my word for it.
