OK, so I've got soloing down pretty well as a bard... but
I also duo quite often with my friends alt monk.  Trouble
is, monks are great at ditching aggro... but I"m not.

Monk just plain cannot get a mob off me after I've
charmed it, and has some trouble getting other mobs
off me.

Is there some song I already have that could be helping
with this?  Or am I going to get one in the future?

Who knew the cleric ability I'd be missing most would
be Atone?  Or even a bloody Root?
