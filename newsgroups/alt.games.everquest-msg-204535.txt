Understand, understand.

Me, I can't handle alts. I hate going from 25-45, that's my most <grind>
<grind> <yawn> area of the game (Imho, many others have different opinions
and I won't say they are wrong)

45-52 was a blast, 52-55 was a blast on those rare occasions I got a good
group. I find soloing, even charm soloing, induces little square imprints on
my forehead from falling asleep at the keyboard.

I myself have left the whole game... was about time for a break in any case,
and SoE has given me this shiny new toy in a SWG beta tester account as
well. Saved me from hours of more Roller Coaster Tycoon I guess (not that
RCT is a bad thing.)

Fortunately, my guild never quite made the hop to Uber Leet raiding guild.
We're just a family guild with some of those people that put the 'funk' in
dysfunctional.... :)

Imho, you are, from what I see, enjoying yourself.  And that, I think more
than anything, is what EQ is about. Enjoying yourself (and paying SoE $13 a
month for the privilege of enjoying yourself, but what ya gonna do. I spend
less a year on games since starting EQ, so I'd say if it's not a win, it's
at least a draw). Good hunting
