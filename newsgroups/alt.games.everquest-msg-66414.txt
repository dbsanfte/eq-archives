  ...?  A 1400 mhz Athlon, a GeForce3 Ti200 and 512 mb of RAM and it's going
to "crawl by"?  If so, something is severely wrong.  I know it'll blaze
through old world zones, unless the new engine is totally jacked.  I haven't
had any experience with Luclin though, but I'd like to think it'll be
relatively smooth there too.

  Anyway, it's a great price/performance system, but I'd go with DDR memory
instead of older SDR.  The difference in price shouldn't be that big, but
the difference in performance ought to be sizable.  It's basically the
system I plan on building in about a month, though I plan on using a KT266A
based motherboard and am leaning towards gambling with a RADEON 8500
graphics card, depending on what I read in the tech support forum over the
next few weeks.
