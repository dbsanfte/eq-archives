Pfft.. if you wanna call it soloing.  The ones that are at 126 ( for the
MOST part, Im NOT making a blanket statement here ) have managed to score
vassals that are producing amazing amounts of Exp for them. I played AC for
a LONG time, and took a couple of characters intop thier 90's solo, with no
vassals. The treadmill just becomes AMAZINGLY bad at that point. Im not fond
of the tread mill in EQ, but at least you can point to various points in the
process and see some sort of accomplishment, whether it be a specific level,
or a certain aa or what ever. AC just didnt have the sense of rewards along
the way that EQ does.

This is all naturaly my 2cp.
