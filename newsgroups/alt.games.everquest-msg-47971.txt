Bah! I'm so used to equipping hafling druids, I didn't notice that you are a cleric
and therefore follow the Little Scamp (as my own halfling calls Bristlebane.) The
Bristlebane idols do not give WIS; they give 3 DEX and 4 AGI. You want to get a
small wisdom deity with 2 WIS.

Vale is a druid armor; it takes a Karana imbue but not a Bristlebane. At this time,
there is no player made armor that takes a Bristlebane imbue (don't complain to me;
write Verant and bitch at them.)
