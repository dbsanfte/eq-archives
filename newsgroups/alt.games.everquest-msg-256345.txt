Although it probably isn't what you are looking for, perhaps the
Forgotten Halls in Nedaria's Landing might be something.

Aside from the kos wolves and majestik grizzlies (fortunately, no
Jaggedpine faction hit), the zone in is not too far from the
expedition npc (elf who is on the southern pier). The zone in is
inside a cave on the north zone wall -- used to have bunches of
majestik grizzlies inside, no more -- with a Taelosian and a gray rock
(click on to zone in) near her.

Npc where you zone in can return you to the cave. Else you can end the
expedition and you get ejected to the same place.

The npcs and golems there /con apprehensive (at least to my halfling
druid) and you might take a walk around to see the sights.

There are two rooms. One with a bunch of "a squeaking rat" and one
with bats. They will con dark blue and indifferent. They will always
/con dark blue unless (I suppose) you gain a bunch of levels without
leaving the expedition. The rats, and presumably the bats, are not
social until you get to 53 (?) then it starts to gets bad or so I
surmise from the comments.

With a late 40ish druid going solo, I found that the rats would resist
my root occasionally, resist my terrorize animal spell occasionally,
resist (fully or partially) my fire-based nukes and dot occasionally,
more rarely resist my ensnare, and do a fair amount of damage (max
about 100). It was most irritating when they would resist several
times in a row. My magic-based dots always landed. They also have a
bunch of hit points (about 2-3K?). They yielded maybe 1.5 pct xp per
kill.

I think there is room to fear-kite down the hallways. You could fight
among the rats without aggro/adds unless you hit them.

Just don't accidentally hit or cast on the Taelosians or the granite
whatits, for they are very social.
