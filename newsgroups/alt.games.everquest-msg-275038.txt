vitality?

When you have vitality then you earn double the experience points and
when it runs out you go back to just earning normal experience points.
You get an amount of vitality every hour (on the hour) regardless of
whether you are logged in or not and you lose vitality every time you
gain experience.

I believe that you have two seperate pools of vitality, one for
adventuring and one for tradeskilling.  I also believe that this is how
it always worked - the only change being that they are now telling you
how much vitality you have and how much experience you are earning.
