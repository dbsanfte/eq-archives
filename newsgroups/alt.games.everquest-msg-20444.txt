What strikes me as odd is that EQ doesn't require any sort of installation
if you have backed up the EQ folder.

Try copying out your opt and ini files like I mentioned before...it might be
that one of them is looking for it.

You might also try simply creating those 2 files and stick them in your EQ
folder & see what happens (if your Windows is set up not to show file
extensions you'll probably want to change that).
