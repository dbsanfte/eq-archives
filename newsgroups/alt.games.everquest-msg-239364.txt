Tracking a target gives replies like "X is forward to the right" or "V is
behind you to the left" or "Q is to the right". If I am facing north and get
the message "D"Vinn is to the north"  Actually D'Vinn is in the tower and
everyone knows that unless there is a bad train in CD. Tracking does not
take into account up and down distances. Track does not take into account
there are building walls and/or mountains between you and what you are
tracking.  Nor does track give a true distance to travel to the target. If I
am standing outside the tower in Crushbone and get the message "Emperor
Crushbone is to the north"  what do I tell the bard? Because you can not get
there by going north from that spot. The entrance to the castle is not
visible from that spot. Nor is the door, blood pit, twisting hallway, Throne
room or the circular stairway. Track sees the target as inches in front of
you. It does not tell you the target is high above your head and 50% of the
mobs listed will have to be killed.  In LDoN adventures many players ask me
(ranger track at 200) if there are named on track. Most of the time they are
not on track. I read someplace they do not pop until 20% of the Adventure is
completed. But I bring up track which I have made into a window from the top
of my screen to bottom of my screen. I will see 3 pages of dark blues that I
must scroll through.  The ones without a "a" or "an" in front of their name
are the named I am told.  Mean while the bard puller has pulled 2 mobs and I
am suppose to help kill him and the healer is asking if there are any named
on track
