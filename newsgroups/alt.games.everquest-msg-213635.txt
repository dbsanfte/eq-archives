I have been playing my bard for a while now, and I am currently level
31.

I have been experimenting with my charm song, but really havent got
the hang of it. I charm a mob, then charge in to attack another,
ordering my new pet to attack.

Now what? Do I just play the charm song continuously, in the hope that
the charm doesnt break, suffering the extra damage I am taking from a
non-slowed mob? Or do I twist  slow, regen, (whatever) and break off
combat every twist to recharm the mob every 60 seconds, hoping I can
target and successfully sing before either the charm wears off, or I
get stunned?

Or do I just stand back, and let the charmed mob take a pounding, and
only join in the fight when one of the two combatants is dead?

S.
