It's funny. My own experience with Dune, and that of most of the people
who frequent rec.arts.sf.written, is that you must have read Dune at a
young age to really like it. Most people who have read Dune *after*
being exposed to large amounts of quality SF aren't really that
impressed.

I loved it to bits, myself, when I first read it, but I've been trying
to re-read the book on ocassion in the last few years, and I just cannot
find in it what I used to.

Now, if you want Science Fiction to blow your socks off *and* leave you
thinking, check out any of Iain M. Banks's "Culture" novels.
