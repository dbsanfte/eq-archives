Ayep. Prepatch, it was rediculously simple. (Though it still drove me
insane, but I just hate tradeskills in general.) When I heard the patch
was coming, I drove my smithing up into the 180's (because I still may
finish the spirit of Garzicor quest someday.) Prepatch you could do it
on banded, and even if you were KOS in freeport (like my troll) I was
able to do it in a combination of working in Thurg and on the moon and
got further than Martin needs in a couple of evening's sessions.

Now that they nerfed the triv on banded down to 115 or so, I'd say the
new smiths are really fucked.
