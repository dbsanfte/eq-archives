You're definitely not stupid...this same thing is happening to me with
Round Kick on my monk, and I've tried it SEVERAL times.  You may want
to take a look at some of your other skills, and watch how many
training points you have when you go back to retrain kick.  Here's my
story:

I dinged 5, and went to train round kick..yay!  So I start fighting,
hit the hot key, and nothing..he won't round kick.  So I'm fighting
along, somewhat puzzled, and notice that mend has come up..so I hit
the hotkey.  You have gotten better at mend (5)!  WTF??  I had trained
mend up to about 12 or so because I got tired of it failing.  So I go
back to my trainer and indeed, not only have I apparently not trained
round kick, mend is indeed back down to 5, AND safe fall, which I had
trained at 3, is showing not trained, and my skill points have jumped
back up to 23.  I've retrained multiple times, and every time, same
result, I jump back to 23 skill points and lose all the skills.  I
sent in a bug report on the matter last night, but  this morning the
matter became even worse, with me getting kicked back to the log in
screen following every fight.  Was going to petition, but ended up
logging after one final attempt at testing the matter, and crashing
again.  I didn't try playing Marxus, but I'll be checking this out a
little more closely on Sunday.
