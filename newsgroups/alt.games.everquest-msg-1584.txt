 From what I've seen, all of the casters have some type of "Imbue"
spell.  They will only be able to Imbue a few specific types of items
(I don't mention gems here as druids have an imbue plains pebble) so
what you'll need to do is find a caster that worships the same god to
imbue you a stone.  However, remember that different stones grant
different things.  There's a great reference chart at
WWW.CASTERSREALM.COM  It's un the jewelry reference chart.  They've
just added the religion jewelry.

Hope this helps.
