My Geforce 2 MX400 is doing very well in one of my boxes.  Had problems with
one of the Radeon 9000's running Windows 98, but managed to get that going.
I suggest you go to the SOE tech forum and follow the video card
driver/directx 9 install instructions exactly as they state.  In the case of
the Radeon 9000 under win98, I also have to start dxdiag BEFORE running EQ -
if I do that, it works great (kinda getting to be like making pentagrams and
burning tallow candles with all the wierd stuff you gotta do to play a game
these days!).
