Uh... choosing a *rogue* as a loner class is going to be incredibly 
hard.  Try a necro.  I've played both, rogue is for when I feel like 
grouping, necro for when I don't (or can't ;p).  It's a nice mix.  You 
could try a druid as well, but they get nagged a heck of a lot more for 
help than necros do (I've been asked all of 4 times for help - 3 from 
guildies)  You don't *have* to stick with one char, despite what some 
people will say.

Nothing starts KoS up there, except *perhaps* some stuff in the Serus - 
I can't remember the exact history, but they got all huffy at somebody 
for letting DEs in and split.  But IIRC my agnostic DE rogue was dubious 
to the entry guards.  Was too chicken to wander farther in and find out.

Thanks for finally posting some info, btw.
