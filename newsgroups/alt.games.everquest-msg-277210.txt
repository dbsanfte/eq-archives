The method of watching who the mob is facing, and watching who is taking 
damage is generally the norm. But its highly unreliable, a slowed mob 
that's missing a fair bit is tough to figure out that way. A caster mob 
who has aggro on a melee, but pauses to cast a debuff or dot at a 
distant foe is similiarly hard to discern.

/assist on the mob is better, but takes time away from your own 
combat... and if the mob is targeted on the enchanter, and the enchanter 
is targeted on a mezzed add... using /assist again to switch back is 
obviously going end up potentially waking the add and and annoying the 
enchanter, if not wiping the party. So you you need target the MA, and 
then assist him to get back on target... its a pain.

If you have GoD, and you have leadship turned on, for 7 leadship points 
you can purchase the Health of Targets Target ability. This gives 
everyone in the group a foolproof method of seeing who has aggro. 
Because when your targeted on the mob, the HoTT window shows what the 
mob has targeted... and that is who 'has aggro'.

Unfortunatly its effectively level restricted to 50th level, because you 
will not be able to collect 7 LXP AA points until you are over 50.

However, once you can get it, the HoTT ability is very much worth the 
price. Along with a number of the other lxp aa abilities. And there is 
no reason you can't start saving lxp now so that you can purchase it 
shortly after dinging 50.

Anyone who's gotten used to working in groups with the "communication" 
lxp/aa's (including delegate ma, hott, target health, spell 
identification, buff inspection and even find path to pc) will tell you 
they are worth every point.
