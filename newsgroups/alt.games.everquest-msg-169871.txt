It was definitely a blast the first time, but now, I find those first 
levels horrible.  I hate, I hate, I hate them.  Test is an exception, 
because there, I always have a group - and a decent group, at that.

Still, I don't want those levels shortened.  Good god, no.  If I run 
into someone and they're an idiot at level 10, it's not a big surprise.  
Level 20, still not any real surprise.  Level 30?  Something is wrong.  
Level 40?  It's time to start avoiding that person in every possible 
way.  I like being able to filter ;p
