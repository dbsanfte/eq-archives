Oh certainly it could.  Suicide is often (though not always) an
act of cowardice.  There's a good reason that these guys and 
gals are convinced of heavenly paychecks for offing themselves.

However, for some it is without doubt an act of sacrifice.  The
true cowards are those of *any* nation or cause who use children
in this way.  The cowards are those adults who sit safe in their homes
and brainwash these kids into dying for them.  It is an inexcusable crime
against humanity to send children to their deaths in this manner.
