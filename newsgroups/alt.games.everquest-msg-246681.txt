But isn't it generally assumed that Joe Public is running unpatched 
winders of whatever incarnation and running OE with the preview window 
open and opens whatever attachment comes along? Making it a downloadable 
program, activeX applet, or something implanted in the user's arm by a 
trusted family doctor who has perused the source code isn't going to 
make any difference to Joe Public who blindly does all the wrong things 
anyway, regardless of warnings etc.

The folks who are uptight about it are, theoretically, savvy enough to 
use activeX responsibly to get what they want and then make sure it 
doesn't do anything harmful later. The rest of the world... well... 
they're ignorant anyway and no amount of folks trying to help them is 
going to help. "But the e-mail was from someone I *know*! Why would they 
send me a virus? Why didn't the free copy I got of McAfee back in 1998 
catch it?"

Seriously, the threat is minuscule. The people who are going to 'leave 
their doors unlocked' (Which is a completely crappy analogy because it 
makes it sound like it's in the hood on a Saturday night when it's more 
like giving the guy at the car wash the keys so you can watch him drive 
it through the funny glass tunnel to wash and detail the car for you. 
After all, they don't say, "and never turn activeX off again."), are 
going to anyway, whether Sony wants them to or not.

This sounds a LOT like folks making a mountain out of a molehill. Sony 
isn't TELLING them what browser to use. What they're telling them is "If 
you want to play OUR game in OUR beta, where WE get to control who gets 
in and who doesn't, you've got to go to THIS website and fill out THIS 
form and THIS applet has to run." They don't care what browser we use. 
They care what browser you sign up with that one time, but as far as 
using it forever, they could care less. They're not in the browser market.

IE comes packaged with windows. Everybody has it. This method, the 
activeX method allows them to keep it local. If it's a downloadable prog 
it could be hosted on any site anywhere and the prog itself could be 
changed couldn't it such that the information went somewhere other than 
Sony? I think the method they used is more secure than the other. Yes. 
ActiveX isn't probably the BEST tool for the job in an environment where 
the admin knows what everybody's running, but here... everybody's got IE 
(unless they remove it) so it's a safe bet they can run it with a 
minimum of calls from ppl saying, "I downloaded the file, but can't find 
it." or whatever.

Sorry it was so long. I dunno what got into me hehehe.
