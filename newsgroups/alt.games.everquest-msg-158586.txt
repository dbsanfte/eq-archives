Most people, I think, start out in situations where they wind up going
on pickup raids (e.g. Vox, Naggy) and get into that mentality where
every chump and his brother who show's up get's to roll on whatever
equally. Hell, often it's somebody who wasn't even in the fight who
walks off with stuff.

It often takes a long time before they get into a guild that has the
capability to take on even modest targets without picking up strangers
(the old planes, Kunark or WW dragons, bigger stuff in Kael, DN, Hole,
things on that scale) where they could have access to loot they would
never see in single groups or with pickup raids.

And there's a definite mental transition that happens to get from point
A to point B. We're seeing some people posting in this thread in support
of the OP, and judging by a combination of their level and their EQ
experiences against larger targets, I'd say they haven't quite made the
jump and are still in "Point A Thinking" mode. I know I sure used to be.
I probably even posted here about it back in the day. However, now I see
that things just don't work that way.
