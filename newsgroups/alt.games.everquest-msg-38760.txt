ISP not working? nah this is AOL (im serious). I did recently alter my network
settings and bound tcp/ip protocol solely to my dial up adapter in an attempt
to shut down ports 137 138 and 139.

This file was the problem. I extracted it from the windows disk and the dns
host not found error is fixed, however while searching for this file i found
multiple instances of it in a few programs. sfc did not mention any file had
been corrupted and i didnt specify a locaton for the extraction so the defaul
dir must be where it was needed(??).

Thans alot for the informative help :)
