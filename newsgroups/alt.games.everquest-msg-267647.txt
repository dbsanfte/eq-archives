Im a lvl 9 fighter in Freeport and I cant find anything to fight thats
any good.  Ive tried the sprawl but its either got underconned boss
mobs in groups or things that are too easy and give less then 1% exp
and very little loot.  When you do get something its worth maybe 8
copper.

Im kinda lost on what to do next, all my armor is green but I cant
make any money to buy better.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.
