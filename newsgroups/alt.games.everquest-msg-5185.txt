I login wanting to make some headway through hell, can't get group. I
start setting up to solo (ick) when a friend going to kaesora offers
me to come along. All I have to do is cross warsliks and meet him in
field of bone. Simple, right?
Except that with my clipping turned way down again, I run off a cliff
as I am about to check where I am, and fall into water. OK, I think,
water won't hurt. It did hurt. This wouldn't have been a problem if
not for the fact that I had just taken some other minor fall damage -
I get hit for 677 points, die, unding back to 34, and have no clue
where I my corpse is. A friendly necro finds my corpse and drags it to
OT zone, running into Grachnist and assorted others on her way. I
proceed - with levitate - find the zone to FoB without falling off
more cliffs, zone and crash. I am now patching FoB so I can log in (I
had only run half the Kunark patch before and never had a problem in
the 3 zones I'd been in) and gate her back to Overthere as my friend
and his group were having trouble in Kaesora and I don't want to die
again.

I am having a shitty weekend and didn't need this game to start giving
me crap as well :/
