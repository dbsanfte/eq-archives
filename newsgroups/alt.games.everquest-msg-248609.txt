So every time someone decides to begin a post on something else which is 
'off topic', he needs to reset his filters?

It's common courtesy throughout usenet to use [OT] in a group when 
talking about off-topic posts, as [OT] is a standard tag across the 
groups. That way, whatever group you go into, anyone not wanting to see 
an off-topic post will have a filter for anything with [OT] in the subject.
