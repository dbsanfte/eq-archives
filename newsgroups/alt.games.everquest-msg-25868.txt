Generally speaking, when the primary healer or enchanter says run, run.

If the healer in your group sucks and you have no enchanter, it's pretty
safe to run when there's no way in hell of winning.  You'll know those
situations...just remember that with an enchanter or high enough level bard
in the group the number of max critters have just jumped noticeably.

When you get to know more than one person in the same guild that you like,
and after you've read their charter and their message board to see what
they're like, and you've decided that your reputation won't be sullied by
having their guild name next to your character name.

Don't ever join a guild that invites you before they get to know you (at
least a LITTLE).
