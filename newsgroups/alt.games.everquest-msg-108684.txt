He also should get flamed by the resident intelligent people.  Believe
it or not, it is possible to make a "test" that actually contains an
on-topic minor question, as was demonstrated above.

If it works, fine.  If it doesn't, also fine.  The "test" has been
performed, and in a sensible fashion.

The only requirements for said test be that it be a message that will
elicit a response which you don't mind not getting, and that it be a
relatively short missive so you don't waste lots of time typing it up.
In other words, a "test" can be performed simply by providing a minor
question, or by providing a short response to someone else's thread.

As for testing a sig, why didn't he simply post a response to someone
and tack his sig on at the end with no commentary such as "Hey!  Look!
I'm adding my sig!  Ain't it wonderful?"  If his sig shows up, then
obviously adding sigs is working.  If it doesn't...
