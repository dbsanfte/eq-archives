The zone line is not the "Train Tracks"  bonehead!  If I had been talking
about the main hallway in KC or even the central entrance on the DL side,
then yes, that would be the train tracks.  I'm talking about people who come
running to the zone line with several mobs in tow and escape by zoning in,
leaving anyone who happens to be sitting there recovering from a near death
experience to deal with their mess.
It's attitudes like yours that infuriates me amd thousands of other
reasonable peeps out there when it comes to this zone.  The people that have
the idea that this is war and anything goes - fuck whoever happens to get
caught up in their shit.
Case in point - I had just exited KC the other day after determining that
the zone was just plain overcrowded, and was hanging around the zone line
with my Ranger and Cleric, buffing and medding in preparation to go out and
work the giants when some asshole comes running in to the LEFT entrance with
2 dogs on his ass.  Two whacks from each of these guys and my Cleric was
down to 2 bubs of health.  Managed to zone back in to try and catch the name
of the fucker, but of course he was gone - and was greeted by a train
brought by someone training out CORRECTLY!  Of course!  All I could do was
zone back out again - at least the dogs were gone.  Sat down to med back up
enough to heal myself when ANOTHER idiot comes running in with a couple of
spiders!  Two stuns and about 500 hp damage and my Cleric is dead.  Talk
about pissing me off...
I'll tell you one thing - people who work this zone with this attitude can
rot as far as I'm concerned.  I will never give them a rez no matter what
they offer me - and sooner or later they WILL need it.
If it weren't for the fact that I HAVE to come here to complete my epic I
would never come back.  As it is, it's a great zone for xp and there are
some decent drops to be had.  I have to admit that I have met some very nice
people here, but all it takes is one asshole to ruin it.
As I play on an American server (as do 80% of the worlds players), I expect
people to use the same side that they drive on.  It's the Europeans that
like to drive on the WRONG side of the road so if I were to play on a Euro
server I would expect the direction of flow to be bass-ackwards, but this is
not the case. (Our Aussie bro's also drive on the wrong side of the road,
but since they are on the bottom of the world and everything else is
backwards there, I can allow them a little slack :)  (J/K)
Perhaps we should petition Verant to put up a big yellow caution sign with a
big black arrow pointing the way for the E-Babies to follow when they come
here...
