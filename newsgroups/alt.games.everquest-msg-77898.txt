Lately, I've become a bit curious regarding the Norrath statistics. I
would love to know how large Norrath is in terms of surface area, and
how many NPCs inhabit it -my own ballpark guess would be 10 to 15
thousand mobs at any given time-.

It would be also interesting to know the size of the Norrathian economy,
as in how much money is floating around, and how much platinum enters
the economy in one day. Of course, with vendor prices fixed, there is no
way to accurately measure the inflation rate, unless you resort to
averaging items that have been in from the beginning, but are still
traded these days, like the Stein of Moggok or the Flowing Black Robe.

Stupid little statistics, like number of mobs spawned and killed per
hour on your average server, number of player deaths per hour and things
like that would be fun to know, if admittedly useless. A few others,
like percentage of deaths that get resurrected, broken up by level,
percentage of players with a speed buff on at any given time and things
like that would be more useful, and of course, Verant would be also more
reluctant to share them.
