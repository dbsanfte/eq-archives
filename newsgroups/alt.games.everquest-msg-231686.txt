Depends on the class-based system.  Some class-based systems allow
multiclassing.  D&D 3rd edition is a good example.  The D&D system is very
sensible.  When you level, you basically can pick which class to level in.
So, if you were a 9 Fighter, and leveled, you could level to 10 Fighter, or
you might instead take a level of Cleric, becoming a 9 Fighter/1 Cleric.
That counts as a 10th level character.  The various class tables mix in an
intelligent way when you multiclass, so the 9F/1C, for example, will not be
as good at combat stuff as a 10F, but will be better than a 10C.
