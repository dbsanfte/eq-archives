For those that complain about the lack of customer service by Sony regarding EQ
issues, you should try ebay's.  Ebay has very little interaction with anyone
unless it could potentially cost them money.  Ebay pulled EQ sales due to the
fact that they didn't WANT to fight a court battle.  Other auction sites have
exploded in use  and have pretty much told Sony to "Sue Us", which they
haven't, even after a few years of operation.  

I don't think that Sony feels they could win a judgement and even if they did,
it wouldn't be enforceable.  What Sony really fears is a judgement AGAINST
them, which would open up ebay to once again accept these auctions.  The suit
regarding the RIAA is an unrealistice comparison, since that suit regarded the
COPYING of material, sales of EQ items would be different, since you are
actually selling the original item.  Kind of like selling a record or CD after
you have listened to it.  Would that be a lawsuit the RIAA could win against a
seller, since it is virtually the same thing...the resale of an item in your
posession?   I don't know if they could win a suit in that case, but almost
guarantee that the RIAA would not invest millions of legal dollars to try it.
