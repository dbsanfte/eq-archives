Well, since you were saying it as a refutation to my claim that one server 
certainly COULD do it. What you stated, in the context you stated it, 
extrapolated that it could not be done.

Perhaps I misread that.

>Seven percent load on your 7000-user server? 

One of my servers is an SGI ChallengeL. She's the sister of the boxes that 
brought Jurassic Park to fame. She is ~6 years old. Man of my "users" are 
geeks. These are people that run mailing lists, pull a LOT of web traffic, 
and receive a lot of email. Right now she has around 600 processes running 
and is at under 10 percent load.

Many of the new machines on the market outdo her in all regards.

No shared pipeline calculating the motion of millions of pixels. Person X 
loc is 100.87,352.10(the .xx part is heading) and is (running walking 
casting). People in combat really don't have much more than that. 

EQ is effectively, from the server point of view, the largest MUD ever 
made.
