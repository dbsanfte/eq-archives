Depends on what you plan on fighting in there, but if you are going in to
start getting a feel for the zone, you have a decent group for it.  Chanter
for crowd control, Pally to MA, Monk to do damage, Shaman to slow, Druid to
get out of the zone, and to succor in case of emergencies, cleric to rez.  I
got a map at www.eqmaps.com, as www.eqatlas.com does not have one yet.
After you zone in, you will want to hop down in the basement, and kill mobs
until one of you gets a key off one of the giant sharp toothed sperm.  Then,
you can venture into the North wing using the key (it's a candle).  I would
guess that you will want to take care about how far you venture in given the
levels of your group memebers.  You get keys to the other wings by killing
more sperm in the wings.  Others can probably offer you good advice on
levels, and what to go after.
