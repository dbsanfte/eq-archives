Guess they will take the percentage extra that the hell levels took and add
it to regular levels with a ever increasing gradient towards lvl 60.

If they don't, then the extra exp that we had to do in 25,30,35,40,45,51
will be a boost to those of us sitting in 54 and 59. You would end up with
people logging in at lvl 59 after patch and get a message Ding! Welcome to
lvl 60
