Soloing as an enchanter is risky to say the least :)

You have 4 basic methods:

0) Melee.  On second thought, make that 3 methods.

1) Root and nuke/dot.  Given that your roots are weak (usually break on 
the first nuke) and that your nukes and dots suck when you look at the 
mana cost per damage, this isn't a very good option.  I really only 
present it here for completeness.

2) Animation.  Summon an animation, haste it, buff it, optionally equip 
it, slow your target and hope the animation wins.  Help out with 
nukes/dots/debuffs.  This is a decent method of soloing if you can find a 
spot where your animation does sufficiently well against the mobs around 
there.  You'll have to get beat on for 1 combat round minimum, but your 
rune should keep you from getting beat up too badly before your animation 
can taunt the target off of you.

3) Charm.  The riskiest method of soloing, but also the most rewarding 
and most fun (IMO).  Find a weak-minded (read: low magic resist) target 
to bend to your will, tash it, charm it, (optionally, and if you feel 
you've got the situation in hand enough to try it) haste it, equip it.  
Find a target you'd like to kill, root it, slow it and send in the pet.  
Here's the important part: keep the target rooted.  A hasted pissed off 
ex-pet beating on you is enough to deal with.  With any luck, you'll blow 
through 5 or 6 kills before your charm breaks :)  When your pet gets low 
on health, break charm using an invis and root/nuke/dot it to death.  My 
typical spell lineup when I'm doing something like this usually looks 
like (not saying this is anything close to the "best" order, it's just 
what I've been used to for a long while so it's the order my spells go 
in):
1) PBAE stun (color shift line)
2) Rune
3) Root
4) Tash
5) Long mez
6) Slow
7) Charm
8) Short Mez (lvl 4 or whatever the first one you got is)

You'll need to pick one to swap out for haste when that wears off.  When 
charm breaks early, you'll want to use your fast-casting stun on the ex-
pet, then your short mez, then tash and re-charm.  Also be sure to keep 
the target rooted while the short mez wears off.  If you can find a 
snaring class to duo with (druid or ranger works best, the other 
classes' snares are too short in duration), this gets a LOT safer :)
