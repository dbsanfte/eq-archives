I just noticed that begging is still a skill, it was worthless a
couple of years ago, but then again so was fishing, and now look what
we get (well until tommorow I'm told), so I've decided to go ahead and
lvl it up.  Just wondering if anyone has maxed out beg and what the
best reward you got for begging is?  Also is there place I can skill
this up quicklier than other places?

Thanx for the info
