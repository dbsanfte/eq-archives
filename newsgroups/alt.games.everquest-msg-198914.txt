. Always bind in a safe place.

Actually, as a side note to this, places that you might *think* are safe are
not always so. When I started my Wizard many moons ago I bound myself inside
the bank in Qeynos. I'd hunted in Black Burrow untiil the zone was almost
green, and had turned in the Gnoll Fangs for the experience they gave. I had
a bit of a fright when I logged on, and was attacked and killed over and
over by a wandering corrupt guard!

When grouping it's an idea to have Instill or one of the higher level
root-type spells memorised, because these are best used to *park* any mobs
that were pulled in error. These root spells are great for crowd control.
Simply have your group take out the mobs one at a time whilst you refresh
the root on the mobs thus keeping them *parked* - HTH.

Regards,

Stevie. (63 Wizard)
