Wrong.  Their game, their definition.
You have no rights in CoH except those you are granted by the OWNERS.

Language evolves.  Words and expression are not writ in stone - they
change.


The term "Hacker" had one meaning before the media go hold of it and
used it to describe the activity of "Crackers".

How about "Fag" and it's meaning of cigarette in the UK and homosexual
in the USA.  

How about "Gay"?  
Sure had a non homosexual context back in the 1920's didn't it?
Doesn't now.

How about powerleveling?  
This used to be what they called someone who played hard and leveled up
fast all on their own - now it's used to describe people being fed
experience and leveled up doing nothing.
