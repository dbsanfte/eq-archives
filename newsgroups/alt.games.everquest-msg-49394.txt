Maybe its new, the bashers are just the guards so its odd he'd be
named "Basher" something and be an sk. I never saw an sk one there
before either. Was he as high or nearly as high as the basher guards?

There is a quest to kill troll slayers or troll slayer captain in
ogguk but they are quite low I think. Marda's secret mission.
