When I was leveling my druid up there, many, many, MANY moons ago, it
was FFA.  We even had a GM tell us it was a FFA zone.  That said, I
generally had a good time there, even when we were competing for
kills.  Everybody just seemed to have a good time with it.  Granted,
this was pre-Kunark and the aggregate IQ of most of the severs seems
to have fallen drastically since then.
