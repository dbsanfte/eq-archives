PoI is probably the worst of them for trains, maybe PoJ.  If you fight 
near the PoN graveyard, then, yes, you will likely have problems with 
trains.  Personally, I like to hit a spot on the wall not far from the 
stalkers, it's far enough out that the only people who would be training 
you would be the ones camping the stalkers.  If you get the stalkers, 
then there is no reason at all to ever get trained except maliscously, as 
there is nowhere you can come from farther out in the zone, there is an 
insurmountable cliff past the stalkers.  To get there after zoning in, 
keep the wall to your right, and follow on past a waterfall.  You will 
sometimes get aggro from a single mob as you pass the waterfall, so just 
move up on top of the hill past the waterfall, and take care of that mob.  
After that continue on along the wall, and pick a likely spot.  Pull mobs 
up to the wall, and you should never get adds.  The stalkers camp is just 
a bit farther up along the wall, you will see them, and likely someone 
camping them, so just pick a spot between the waterfall and the stalkers 
in that case.
