I bet!  I'm sure we'll be getting help from friends, including some other 
chanters, for our Royals raid.  I've been on one, and I won the roll on the 
piece and deferred it to the guy who was the closest to his epic ( I hadn't 
started mine ).  He said he'd be sure to help me when it's my time to get 
it - we'll see.

Went on a KCoG Fear raid on Friday, and I was one of 3 chanters there, and 
the other was already epic'd.  The other was the raid leader who had been 
on a LOT of Fear raids and had never seen the Wraith.  The Friday before, 
the KCoG took down a mini ( Fright ) for the first time.  On this raid, we 
took down all the minis, including the Wraith.  I rolled a 238 on a /random 
200 500.  Fuck me, but I'm happy he got his bottleneck piece.  He'll have 
his epic in 2 weeks or so.  Maybe he'll go with us to Chardok =)  Three 
chanters were enough in the King's room last time.  I had no problems with 
Mezzes and I was either level 49 or 51, I think.  We won't be doing Queen.

Fear raid on Wednesday.  Probably 4 chanters going, so chances of me 
getting my piece is slim to none with its rarity.
