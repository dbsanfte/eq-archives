You can overwrite AE mez's? Can you do this with Fascination? Haven't really
used that spell much because of my experiences with the lower leve AE mez
and not being able to overwrite (that was a LOOOOOOOONG time ago tho to say
how long i've been around /snicker)

What are the limitations? do certain mezzes overwrite and other ones do not?
Thanks for answers and time
