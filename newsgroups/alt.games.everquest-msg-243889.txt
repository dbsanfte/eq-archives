For my Dark Elf, as if I would be any other race, cleric the tribute master
is nearly equidistant from PoK as from where the faithstone drops him off.
X zone+faithstone->3rd Gate->Commons->Foreign Quarter(Tribute Master).  X
zone+gate->PoK(even as a character who has leveled nearly entirely in LDoN,
he is always bound in PoK.)->Nektulos->Foreign Quarter.
