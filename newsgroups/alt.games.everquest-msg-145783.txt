Well, for the "lounge chair" necro set the group could be:
4 Necros, Cleric, Druid.

4 Necros gives maximum pet stacking.  The Cleric is a 56+ bot that
is /camp'd at a handy position to deal with the occassional death,
maintaining maximum convenience without giving up any xp.  And as
for the Druid, well...

chimp_01 says, 'I say Basil, have we done Burned Woods lately?'
chimp_02 says, 'What a simply smashing idea, wouldn't you say Neville?'
chimp_03 says, 'Quite'
chimp_04 says, 'Bring the car 'round will you James?'
druid_01 says, 'Burned Woods sir?  We'll be there straightaway.'
[LOADING, PLEASE WAIT]
cleric_01 says, 'Here you are m'Lord, we've laid in a goodly supply of
Chateau LeGimp, will that be all sir?'
chimp_04 says, 'Oh, good show Benson, yes that'll do nicely'
cleric_01 says, 'Very good sir, please ring if you have need of me'
[cleric_01 has gone Linkdead]
[cleric_01 has left the group]
chimp_04 says, 'James, would you be so good as to fetch us a dragon?
one of the blue please, I find that the green simply do not go well
at all with LeGimp'
chimp_03 says, 'Quite'
druid_01 says, 'Of course sir, it would be my pleasure'
