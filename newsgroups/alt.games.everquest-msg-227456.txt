I see that often as well.  I also agree with Lance's analysis,
as far as it goes.  /shrug  I go along with NBG, though I've
occasionally used "any who want can random for any dropable" in
groups I've led (with zero complaints, amazing parallel to the
lack of complaints about NBG, don't you think?).

Lance,
In the end, it just isn't worth giving somebody who believes that
NBG is gospel an excuse to think and speak badly of you.  If you
want to analyze it as a zero-sum "game", consider reputation and
the general unreasonableness of "true believers" as factors in
your calculations and you may reach a different result.  I don't
object to NBG in-game because I play for fun, and acrimonious
debate isn't fun (well, it isn't fun in-game anyway, heh).
