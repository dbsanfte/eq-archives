The Appointed recently reformed, in order to remove a bunch of deadweight.
In order to do this as many as possible met up in one place with a GM, the
GM brought in a guide, he transferred the guild leadership to the guide, and
renamed the guild.  Then he created a new guild called "The Appointed".  So,
it would appear that GMs can do quite a bit when it comes to guilds.
