Pre Kunark, I believe the best regen spell that Shaman got was
Chloroplast, which I believe only does 13 points per tick.  So that
means the Warrior has Double Attack, Dual Wield, Riposte, Parry, and
Disarm, which the Shaman doesn't have, as well as a higher skill in
Defense and Dodge.  The only thing the shaman has that the warrior
doesn't is 13 hp per tick.

Am I wrong on the regen bit?  If it really is 40, then that's pretty
significant, and I'd find it easier to picture the shaman winning.
