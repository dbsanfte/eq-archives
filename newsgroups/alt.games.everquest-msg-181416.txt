First is engine limitations. It's ancient technology. Second reason is
to avoid exploits like standing inside a hut in WC and hacking at a
hill giant's ankles or using them as a sure-fire getaway from bad
pulls. Admitted, the second is *very* secondary. More a side-effect
reason. The first, however, is a huge obsticle and one that would be
more trouble than it's worth to fix.
