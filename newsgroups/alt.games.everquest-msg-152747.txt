It's also pretty random, and what may be a multi-day 30 hour camp for one
person...

Well, when I was doing my VP key, I got the pained soul in less than two
hours.  When I got bored and camped it for a friend, I got it on the second
pop.   Total time camping 15 minutes.

(Finished the key a month ago, still have only found one raid going there,
and that wasn't at a time I was able to attend.)

I think this is the case as well.

Also, other game mechanics make "camping" more beneficial than "crawling."
Casters get more mana regeneration since they are able to spend more time on
thier butts, spawns get split apart in time, resulting in smaller pulls,
meaning safer and faster fights.

That being said, crawling through a dungeon is much, much, much more fun
than camping an area.   We crawled through Chardok last night and had an
absolute blast...  worked our way forward almost to the king room with a
single group.   (We almost got the Grand Loremaster, but a bug caused 2
deaths and an evac as we were clearing the library.)

Besides... camp checks are more fun to respond to.

A person_01 says "Camp check."

Group 1 says "Exit"
Group 2 says "Fort"
Group 3 says "Entrance"
You say "Roving Death Squad"


I do want that summon bandage item though, badly... so that means either
taking every chardok dungeon crawl past the herbalist for 2 or 3 months....
or sitting there and pulling the surrounding area for a night or two.
