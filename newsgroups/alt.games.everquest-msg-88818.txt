Hey all,
Just a quick yes/no question. As having only played good aligned characters,
I am a little confused.
In many areas of the game, there are guards who will kill anything that is
beating on you. In fact, many good aligned NPC's will attack mobs. So, if I
were to be playing an evil char, would some NPC (like Kizdean Gix or the SK
in WC for example) protect me if I was getting beaten on? Or would I only
have the choice of zoning?
Thanks
Chaos
