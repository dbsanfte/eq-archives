Recently I've started recieving random pop-up ads while connected to
the internet, even if I'm not surfing the web.  These don't look like
typical pop-up ads -- they all have 'Messenger Service' at the top of
the window, are plain text (no  graphics), and from multiple
advertisers. 

Until this evening, I've just been anoyed, but have lived with it.
Now one I've spoken to about this has any idea what I'm talking about.
The  main reason why this sin't just OT griping is that one just
popped up in the middle of my EQ screen, and I couldn't make it go
away without camping.

Anyone else experience this?  Task Manager doesn't show any other
application running when the window pops up, so I have no idea what's
causing it.
