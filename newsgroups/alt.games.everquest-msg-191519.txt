Ok this Idea sounded good when I was at work.I ditched it later, but now I'm
drunk,so its like six of one half a dozen of the other.Ok a Cavalier will
get abilities not spells each 5 levels.He or she needs to have high charisma
for the "abilities"to work properly.Except for 14,26,36,ect witch will be
his or her trials where they will go through a test for there shields(as a
cavalier will never get dual wield)From 1st level there shield will signify
there allegiance to there King.As a noble line is needed only races of good
nature with a kingdom are permitted.Humans,High Elfs and Dwarves are able to
be Cavaliers.Ok at 1st lev instead of a tunic you would have a shield with
the code of arms on it.
here are the abilities as I see them:
1st lev "call of will"much like Harm      touch but it will bring your
agility to normal so you can run away from a foe
5th lev "fight til the death"this is self explaining.
9th lev "Battle cry"=an aoe buff centered on the cavalier(trigger)
14th first Shield quest (big named mob plus other quest items)14 shield =aoe
agility also centered around the cavalier,ac buff
18th "Harrang"(trigger)aoe+2 attack,(you know)
22nd "intimidation" able to walk up to a group and pull one.(much like
harmony)(trigger)
26th second shield(bla bla bla)aoe buff

You get the idea the idea the advantage to a cavalier would be that he would
have many buffs going without casting a single spell but his dis advantage
would be that he like a ranger would lack the "Brick Shithouse"Hit points
that a thug warrior would have.

Ok any add-ons or "Your a complete retard" suggestions would be great.
