I'm a young bard - just reached 11 a night or two ago.  While I have a
few 'game friends' that love to group with me, I find it odd and a bit
distressing how many people do NOT want me in their group!

Every now and then I do get an invite to join a group (after very
politely asking of course).  After an hour or two - and sometimes
sooner - someone in the group will say, "Wow - bards rock!"  Then it
all seems worthwhile in my little world again.  :-)

Sure, I can't heal you fast, but I can heal ya at a reasonable rate
while the mana-reliant types are medding.  I can pull like nobody's
business too - selo's is a great boon.   What's that?  We need to run
three zones over?  No prob - let me just start drumming.  We'll get
there quicker.
   
Want an overpull of a bunch of blues?  Heh - chords of dissonance is a
powerful (and/but often dangerous) tool.  Learned that one the hard
way... Nothing like getting smoked in your guild hall when you wonder
what it does.

I can psuedo-tank in a pinch too.  But at level 11, who can't?  My
little ac, haste and str buffs sometimes seem to be appreciated as
well.

C'mon folks - give the bards a chance.  We're fun people, tell amusing
stories and bring more to the table than you might guess! :-)
