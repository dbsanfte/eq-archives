One of the reasons some of us oppose new firearms legislation is that the
current laws are not fully enforced and if they were we wouldn't need further
restrictions.

In the U.S. we already have fairly heavy laws sanctioning the use of firearms
during a crime.

One of the biggest stumbling blocks to reasonable gun control is the fanaticism
of the anti-gun crowd.  At some point in the past (20 years?  I don't have any
details handy and am working from memory) the NRA crowd cooperated and didn't
oppose new legislation in New York City that was supposed to be balanced and
fair.  IIRC what they got was so heavily restricted that a gun owner had to
apply for a permit to take their weapons to the firing range each time (and
anyone who has dealt with NYC bureaucracy will realize that just staying home
and shooting themselves in the head is a less painful process).  In addition it
doesn't help when some fuckwit from the Coalition for Handgun Control is quoted
saying that they intend to end all private ownership of firearms by the 21st
century (which obviously didn't happen, but this kind of statement doesn't lend
itself to achieving a reasonable compromise).
