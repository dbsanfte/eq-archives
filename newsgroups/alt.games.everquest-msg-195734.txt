Of course they are.  Always have been.  "Camps" are 100 percent
invented by players.  There are no rules about them except what
members of the community generally agree to.  If you zone in to EFP,
and shout "Camp check", you will get three answers, "North", "South",
"Back".  Those people recognize those camps.  The person doing the
camp check will either zone back out or they will wait for one of
these camps to clear.  Everyone involved recognizes them as three
seperate camps.  When all the people making the rules say that there
are three camps, then there are three camps.

What happens is that people do take more than one camp, and personally
I have no problem with *that*.  Depending on the camp, in most
situations people can and do take all the MOBs from more than one
camp, from time to time, and I say that if they have the force to do
it, so be it.  Of course, there are limits to this.  A level 60
cutting through SolA looking for Fiery Ore or just farming plat, is a
complete ass if he takes every single gobby in the zone and screws
over the group of level 28 people trying to get experience in the
barroom.  But should he also have to limit his kills to the barroom
camp if he is the only one there when another level 60 zones in and
wants to farm as well?

Perhaps we agree, but are just using different terminology.
