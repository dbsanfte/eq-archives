Actually, "its" as a possessive *doesn't* get an apostrophe.  It's the one
exception that I know of to the rule.  And I hate it.  I always put in the
apostrophe for the possessive, even though I know that it's grammatically
incorrect.

(Another one that people get wrong is putting 's on the end of words that
have an "s" at the end.  The possessive of "boss having a daughter" is boss'
daughter, not boss's daughter.)
