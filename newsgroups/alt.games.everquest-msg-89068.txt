I haven't hunted there personally (well, except to harvest hides with
my level 60 cleric working on tailoring) but several guildmates in
their high 20's have spent some time there.  From their account, you'd
do just fine.

Fighting near the Seru zone (pretty sure you're non-KOS as a
Barbarian), the only aggro mobs to worry about are the zelniaks, who do
have a very large aggro range.  Other mobs there are stonegrabbers &
hoppers - non-aggro, not too tough.

Save any greyhopper or HQ hopper hides you get, tailors will thank
you.  If you're not twinked, greyhopper hides can be used to make
armour with a similar AC to reinforced leather.
