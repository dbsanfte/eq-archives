They're in 3 zones:

In SQ the gnome as you look to the left after entering the mage tower.
In NQ Guard Williamson near the bridge to the castle, the gnome Caretaker 
Somethingorother near the door to Eldarr Grove, and the Executioner 
Someothernamethateludesme near the Ironforge Estate (gives out tradeskill 
writs, the others are all mainly "go kill this a lot.")
The guy standing to the right of the elevator in Eldarr Grove as you face 
the elevator.
