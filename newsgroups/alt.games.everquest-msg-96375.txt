Yeah, it's a bitch for non-powergamers non-twinks.  My first INT caster was
a mage and I think I was only able to buy 3 spells (it's been almost 3 years
now).

But yeah, like others have said, it does get easier the higher you are AND
the longer you play.  You start picking up on tips that make making cash
easier.  If I started out on a new server fresh, I have no doubt I could
have the cash in record (for me) time but it's hard as a new person.
