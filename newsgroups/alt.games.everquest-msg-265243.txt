I don't know ... I generally don't mind people jumping in to assist me 
even if I haven't asked for it and don't need it.  As long as they are in 
roughly my level range, I don't think about it at all, except move on to 
the next group of villains.  I just don't do the same thing myself, 
because I've played DAoC since it was new and there killstealing was a 
bannable offense. I also played two games where killstealing was 
impossible (The Realms and Rubies of Eventide). This seems the obvious 
aswer if the developers really hate it.  (Of course, in CoH we have door 
mission, but not all missions are doors.)

This topic always reminds me of Hawkeye and Cpt America. Hawkeye would 
totally lose his marbles if someone else stole the spotlight, while Cpt 
America would just shrug: As long as the job gets done by someone.  It's 
not hard to guess what side the devs would be on here.
