There are plenty of celebrations that go on in-game in EQ like weddings and
holidays and such and with those events people bring food and drink .It
would be neat if there was a table of sorts to put it all on.I was thinking
of an item you could "rent" from a merchant that could be opened like a
container that you would put stacks of appetizers, main courses, desserts
and drink on(or in) and which then could be "dropped", the graphic would
look like a table with food on it.When a player clicked on it a window that
displays the items would open up much like if you clicked on a container.You
would then grab what you wanted off of it and join the celebration.When all
the items are gone it would vanish,no fuss no muss.There could ,much like
containers , be different sizes of tables each with a different price
range.Since they are "rented" the price should be pretty reasonable like
10gp for a 6 slot table.Just a thought. What do you think,is it a winner or
just another one of my goofy ideas.
