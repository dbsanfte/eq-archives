Bigboy's dumb post did provoke me into using my brain about the very real
issue of people selling and buying plat.

(waits patiently for everyone to crawl out of hiding and stand up again
after they heard "using my brain")

Anyway, I bet you could write a log analysis program using a high level
scripting language (php would rock at it) in under 100 lines that picked up
when somebody bought plat. Items are sold in the bazaar all the time, so
their average worth is easily calculable - you can start counting
characters' networth and 100k jumps will stick out like sore thumbs. So will
10k jumps at the sort of level where someone might consider buying only 10k.

Then you have the problem of proving that the transfer was related to money
changing hands...... and not just friends helping friends.

(uses his brain some more)

Logs could also show that for a week either side of the transaction, the two
characters involved had sweet fuckall to do with one another. No tells, no
common chat channels, didn't group, didn't /say anything about plat within
proximity of one another...

What's everyone think?

cheers,
James
