Theres no kiting room really in PoJ. You could however root/dot and
blast probably pretty well there. Pathing in PoJ is really strange
however, its tough to pull, but once you learn it, its not bad.
Nothing that spawns around zoneout is kos (unless in wolf form - so
dont use it there), but is social. There IS a point at which nothing
will social aggro at a certain level - there are those that kite
through the halls. Somone told me it was 55, but when I pull with my
55 warrior, I still get adds.

Should be plenty of room at certain spots in PoD to kite, but I havent
personally tried it, and at least around the zone in at PoI, its
pretty tight around there, not much room to kite.
