I have no idea why, but something similar happened to me.  I could log
on to any of my characters, except my bazaar mule.  Even another
character in the same zone was fine.  Finally, I deleted the .ini
files for that character, and it all seems to work again.

Perhaps whatever made that character corrupt continued to corrupt your
files on other machines?  I haven't left my bazaar mule up for a
while, so you're making me fear that, when I do, the problem may come
back.
