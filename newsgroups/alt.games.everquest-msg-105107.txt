Agreed, I only collected half the data.  I'll create Beetlfuud to test
L1 with no armor, and as I mentioned in another post I'll have Beetmi
try his armor vs. the beetles as he is now at L4.

[Oh, and btw, we could coordinate a test of "GM reaction time to
complaints about lame names" by having DT or some other volunteer
/petition Beetlfuud and see if a GM shows up before the test is done
and the character deleted :p]

Assuming that an AC buff applies to hit avoidance, I would expect the
same relative benefit from an AC buff on warrior, ranger, paladin,
or shadowknight at lo/mid levels (warrior has a slightly higher Defense
cap, other three are all same until high levels).  I would expect
the apparent benefit to be most easily seen vs. mobs that hit 40% to
60% of the time.  This assumption can be tested, even limited to a
single account I can get some data from my main, tho if the difference
is small (AC buffs from a 52 paladin aren't all that great) it'll take
me quite a bit of fighting to get enough data to be confident it (the
benefit) is there.
