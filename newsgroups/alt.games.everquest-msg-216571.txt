Ya know I already mentioned Sony's malevolent nature.  So you are backing
off your statement that they make pathing/aggro changes without mentioning
them, and instead now say that they may not mention them in a timely manner. 
I'll agree with that.

So you have to re-learn how to pull every time you go someplace new?  That
must suck.

If I know it's plenty for the pull, where is the needless risk?

People that play like you know that.  People that play like me know that
collection missions are the ones you have to play the most like me.  :P

Yes.  Why do you think the cleric should set the pace?  In my experience,
clerics are notoriously overly cautious until they've had some experience
with somebody like me and realize what they're actually capable of.

Cleric sits down after a heal to catch a tick while spell gems refresh.  Do
you not do this?  Do you not notice when your cleric is doing this?  Maybe
you *should* be overly cautious if you are so unaware.

I cast my CHs so they land right after the mob dies so I get full mana regen
time between pulls and minimal aggro.  But I already said I'm not the
greatest 2-boxer nor all that careful with my mana unless I'm in a situation
where I need to squeeze as much out of it as I can.

It does?  Once you adjust for the hp disparity, you'd be surprised at how
close they actually are.  Try parsing mob dps with various sorts of tanks
sometime.

Plenty for a virtue (8%), a CH (5%), and a quick heal if necessary (5%), and
assuming that those all actually take time to cast, I should catch a tick in
there for yet another CH's worth if things are really going bad.

Doomed to think Vindi is a tough fight for eternity.

Well, actually, Vindi is a tough fight.  For a single group...  But you'll
never get to the point where you can have that attitude until you learn to
play.

Ok, say you med to 100% mana and you pull the mob and it starts hitting your
tank for quad 2k's...

Why not?  You want to come up with situations that don't exist, obviously
I should be able to do the same.

You're so far away from what you originally said that you're just sounding
foolish trying to twist into a position you can actually substantiate.

Explain to the guy who didn't understand "body language"?  I'm not sure it's
*possible* to explain to you what it takes to be a good cleric.

The one where you obviously don't use "body language" such as sitting
between heals to catch a tick, timing ticks to start with, etc.  The one
that makes you say that there's no way to regulate mana once a fight starts. 
The one that will make the rest of the clerics laugh at you when you run OOM
while they continue to heal without problems for the next 10 minutes.

I think I've spotted your reasoning...  one mob takes you 20m to kill? 
That's 4 CH's...  please stop letting the magician tank...

Look, it's the "I'm right because this is the way *real* grinding was done
before PoP came out" tactic.  :P  You poor "PoP-tarts" (I love that term, my
apologies to whoever I ripped it off of) are obviously going to require some
training to learn how to play in a dungeon of that relative level of
difficulty.  If you aren't a "PoP-tart" then you simply qualify as a newbie. 
Newbies can be utterly befuddled by my style of play, though those that want
to learn how to "play hard" generally graduate to non-newbie fairly quick. 
It's not difficult to play my way, and considerably more enjoyable if you
have any ounce of adventuresome spirit.  Of course, some people will refuse
to learn the "play hard" lesson and will be doomed to level slowly and
constantly watch people pass them by.

Have fun.  :P
