Rangers do not need Gunthak Gulf WAter.  WE need two drops from nifiliks
(easy easy) on the beach, and one amulet from adherents in Nadox (worth
doing, nice spell). Both times I went seeking the amulet we got it on our
first kill, then never saw another the entire time during that visit.  I'm
guessin you'll have to kill anywhere from one to 20 adherents to get it.
