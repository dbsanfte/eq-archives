My cousin is addicted to computer games. He can be playing game 20 hours a
day and sleep for 4 hours without eating anything other than snacks and
soda. His mom is so mad at him. She take away his keyboard and mouse when
she goes out somewhere. And definately no internet and EQ. Right now I pay
for my cousin's internet and EQ monthly. And he pays me cash at the end of
the month. And yes, he has extra keyboard and mouse somewhere hidden in his
room so he can play when his mom is away.
