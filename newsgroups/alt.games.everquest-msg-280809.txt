No, that's the cry of a 7 year old.  I think the one I heard was more like,
crap, I only have 30 minutes before I have to sort food for the family,
hmm, not going to achieve much in the next 30 minutes then am I.

No, we just had different needs from the game.  We had different desires,
expectations, and needs.  And early EQ didn't meet them.

Engaging a target in EQ, by walking from the Butcherblock zone to the
Faydark ramp you mean?  You've had the game two hours, you know nothing,
and you want to learn how to play with a friend.  It's not asking too much
to expect to be able to learn how to play with a friend.  That's the root
of my point here.  For some, learning how to play at the same time as a
friend without being in the same place can be fun.  For others, the
challenge should be solving problems with that friend together in the same
place playing something which interests you.

>> Oh, an hour?  We'll be gone by then, sorry.

>And? So?

If your play time is short, you've missed a chance to have fun with a
friend.

Yes, you're busy, doing something that you enjoy doing for an hour.  Not
travelling to and from somewhere for an hour.  Travelling can be fun, but
travelling from A to B to do something at B which takes longer than what
you want to do at B is pointless if you don't enjoy travel for the sake of
it.

Obstacles that get in the way of playing the game at a convenient time when
time is limited.  The challenge should be in the playing, not in the
getting together to play.

Fine, and I'm allowed to have fun my way, by getting to where I want to be
quickly, so that I can spend time with my friends challenging the game
content together.

>Of course, according to you, because dying isn't FUN it should be 
>eliminated. 

According to something you just made up and attributed to me you mean?  I
think death adds a challenge, and that the main impact is lost time.  If
you're on a limited time then spending half that getting back to your
corpse or the zone is a penalty.  Seems reasonable.  However, if the kid
takes ill and you have to suddenly quit out of the game in the middle of
the fight, seems ok to me that you can log in the next day safe in the
knowledge that you can recover your corpse for a small in-game fee and not
lose your gear.

>So they should remove dying, make you invincible, and thus 
>allow you to have more FUN. 

Alas no, because for me, the FUN comes from challenging the game with my
friends in a group.  Together.  The frustration comes when the game makes
it hard to get together in the first place.

Insult me as you feel free (I've just ignored those sections mostly), call
me a cry-baby as you feel free, I'm just frustrated by the constant 'the
game is too easy' crap.  It's now much easier to get somewhere and do
something with your friends, of that there is no doubt.  It's much easier
to get your corpse and stuff back if the crap hits the fan, of that there
is no doubt.  But the key for me, is that the *content* is still
challenging and fun and immersive, and that I *enjoy* that content and have
more *fun* in that content when I'm grouped with friends, at any level, and
that make it harder to get together and group quickly is an annoying
frustration that they've mostly gotten rid of.

>Without being worried about pesky hitpoints,

Er of course not, but then, I never said it was, you just made that up for
whatever crazy reason you felt like.

Er sure whatever, personally, I'm happy that I can play with my friends and
challenge the content, and not get stopped by the UI, boat rides which
consume 1/3rd of my contiguous play time or doing nothing other than press
left and right in the run from Qeynos to HHK.
