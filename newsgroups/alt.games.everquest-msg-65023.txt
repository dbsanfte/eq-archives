Pardon me for seeming a tad off here but XML is a markup language for web
interfacing -- external apps to web pages.  How can a color schema for EQ --
a fully controlled internal app -- be impacted by XML settings.  I've had
the 8.1 DX8 installed on my machine for about 2 weeks now with the OLD EQ
(not using the DX8 drivers for EQ though -- just the DX7)

No joke, I am interested in it.  I did a reg scan for XML, found the schem
info, found the color settings  -- bit flip wise, trans seems to be
dynamic/app specific.

I suspect that it has to do with the 4MEG of video RAM on the 82815 onboard
card -- they just pack to much onto the card and it can't handle the new
load (though the graphics, mode shifts, etc... seem to work fine).  Just
transparency color is black.
