Some people don't read the MOTD.  They log on, jump into things and notice
the bugs, but not the warnings.

Remember, we currently live in a world society that believes in the
following:

1) Nothing is wrong with how I do things.  I bought it, you fix it.
2) Unless I am told by a person, nothing else really matters.

You will see this type of behavior being a customer service representative
or in tech support about 90% of the time.  Best example would be my
Football Ticket taking days when I was young.  We had this big sign saying:
"Tickets sold at the Gym."  The Gate is about 10 to 15 feet from the Gym.
The sign is in big letters, right next to the gate with a nice arrow
pointing to where the Gym is.  9 out of 10 people, even some of the local
residents, walk up to me, give me this blank look when I hold out my hand
for a ticket, then asks, "Is this where we buy the tickets?"  Despite the
fact that I am standing next to the sign that states where the tickets are
sold.

The MOTD is just this case.  It is the big sign that no one really reads
until someone points them to it.

Sit in chat sometime.  Especially when a server goes down and look up on
the banner.  More than likely, there will be a mention of a server going
down, with or without an ETA as to when it will be up or what might have
happen.  You will see people still pop on and go, "WTF happen to
<server>?", even though the message is posted on the banner above.

As I said before, 'Unless I am told by a person, nothing else really
matters.'  In some cases, people don't even READ the patch message, so you
will hear people ask about things already answered had they taken the time
to read the patch message, which, unfortunately, is not always the case for
people.
