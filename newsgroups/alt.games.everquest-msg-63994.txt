That's the same feeling i had in AO, nice looks but something was
missing, never bought DAOC and probably never will, to much money to
spend on something you may not even like, at least AO you can get a
demo for 7 days so you get an idea of how the game works, as far as i
know there is no demo availible for DAOC.
