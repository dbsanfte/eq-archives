Only when you pull out in front of them when they are doing 65 MPH and can't
possibly slow down fast enough to avoid hitting you.  Especially if there is
a semi in the left hand lane next to them keeping them from getting over.
Here in Ohio every on ramp has a yield sign, meaning you must yield to cars
already on the highway.  The same for roads, if you pull out of a parking
lot and someone hits your car then it is your fault for pulling out in front
of someone.
