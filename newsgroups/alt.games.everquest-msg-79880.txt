As a general rule, you can get exp in a group if the 
highest level member of the group is no more 
than 1.5 times your level, or 5 levels higher, whichever 
is larger.

Conversely, anyone below 2/3 of your level can't get
experience if grouped with you.

The golden level is 40 -- when you hit that level, you'll
be able to get exp grouped with absolutely anyone, even
all the way up to level 60s.  But anyone 26 or under
won't be able to get exp themselves if they're grouped
with you.
