Ah, that actually makes sense. If you all movelogged at about the same
time its pretty likely you'd either all get in or none. Or perhaps
ONLY HALF OF YOU WILL!!! ;) That is moderately unlikely though.

My take on it though is that its first come first serve, with euros
being first no matter what. In other words, if you are euro and do it
at the very last possible moment you are still moved ahead of a guy
from the US who does it in the first possible moment.
