Perhaps, but it's still true.

And you'd be right.  His achievement is personal to him, and the fact that
some other guy became manager of a store because his brother owns the place or
because he could go to college does not detract from it.

Fine, achievement of those things can be personal wins for those who
chose that particular challenge of the game.  And they are, regardless of
whether others get the results without the achievement.

That's silly.  They worked no less hard, got no less lucky, and get no less
from the use of the item regardless of how many others have them, by whatever
means.

Prestige yes, equipment no.

You can, in fact, buy many medals and trophys on ebay.  Please distinguish the
prestige of being awarded an honor and the prestige of carrying the ribbon.
While you're at it, note the distinction between the joy of defeating an enemy
to acquire an item and the joy of having and using the item.

Sure.  Also separate those who play once a week and those who play twice and
those who play four times and those who play a lot.  And separate those who
just buy a few things from those who buy an entire castle.  And separate those
who don't like in-game trades of items, which is really just a lesser version
of cash purchases.

Oh, but what if two friends want to play together?  Darn.
