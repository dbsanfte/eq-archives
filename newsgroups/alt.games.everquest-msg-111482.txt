You right man, casting slow as first spell/song allow aggroed 
caster to success invoking their spells during all combat, even if 
they get it. If casting procedure can keep on, tanks have time and 
buffs enough to get back mobs' aggro on themselves.

Root is better in dungeons, snare gets its best in open areas (in 
general the snare spells are faster to cast than root ones, but are 
useless in such small places as dungeons, tunnels and rooms).

As a druid hunting in Faydwer, Commonlands and Desert of Ro, I 
never use root, I have not even memorized it. But it is a 
definitive facts that druids are better at snare as enchanters are 
better at root ;)
