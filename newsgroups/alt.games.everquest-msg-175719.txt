The problem with tradeskills is that the actual making of things in current
games doesn't involve any thought.  It is purely "put the ingredients
together and press some buttons".  DAoC improved the *interface* to this
over EQ, so that you could do it longer without destroying your wrist, but
fundamentally it was the same.  Basically, tradeskills make you click and
drag for things that the character should do automatically.

Compare to running.  When you want to run, you just do a command to start
running in the direction you want to go, and it happens.  If running was
designed the same was as tradeskills, they'd make you press you "left leg
up" button, and then your "left leg forward" button, and then your "left leg
down" button, and then your "right leg up" button, and so on.  That would
not be a fun game!

For current games, it would be better if you simply purchased skill.  Say
you want to raise tailoring...you should simply pay the tailoring master a
certain amount, and that represents the cost of material to practice with.
You should then automatically skill up after a certain amount of game time
has passed (which represents the time spent practicing).  You should be able
to do that time offline--pay the master, camp out and go to bed, and when
you log in the next day, you've got the skill.  If you leave town before the
specified time passes, the skill up timer stops or runs slower, depending on
the trade skill (a baker with a spit would still get skill ups out of town,
but the timer for a smith would only run while in towns with forges).  Past
a certain level of skill, the tradeskill master might require that you
provide specific items or do specific quests before you can skill up, rather
than just taking money.

The only time you should actually have to put items in a sewing kit or oven
or forge and press the buttons yourself is when you are actually trying to
make an item you want to make.  That interface should not be used for
skilling up.
