	Compiling it to check for syntax errors isn't testing.

	Actually, I'm advertising the results of an informal analysis
based on publically available data and my own considerable expertise,
but argument from authority is particularly gauche when you cite yourself
so I've avoided the temptation.

	If client crashes are immaterial why did you bring them up?

	Of course I can.  It's demonstrably true by observation.  There's
no way anyone who'd checked to make sure that the new AA code was working
properly could have missed the fact that it wasn't.  Therefore, they did not
look.

	Unless you're willing to postulate that they looked, saw it was
broken, and just went ahead and released it anyway because what the hell
it's only a game?

	Look, I love EQ.  But watching these guys work is like sitting
in your favorite diner and watching them try and make hash browns
without boiling the potatoes first.  You want to just walk over and 
shake them:  "Boil the spuds!!  You can't make good hash browns unless you
boil the spuds!!  Where'd you learn how to cook, anyway??"

	That's the same mistake a lot of managers make.  The fact is
that an effective QA program saves much more than it costs, so arguing
against implementation on costs grounds is illogical.  Any cursory 
literature search will show this to be true.

>They try to find a balance between 
>potential customer dissatisfaction and development costs. 

	I think they ignore the customers, since they realize that 
it would take a series of major catatastrophes resulting in weeks
long outages and loss of XP/items to cause any kind of exodus.  The
issue isn't customer satisfaction.  It's quality engineering.  They're
related but not necessarily causally.  What *is* causally related to
proper QA is the bottom line on your 8K.

	So they could make more money and have happier customers, but they
still don't bother.  Is that dumb, or what?

>And if your inability or stubborn refusal to consider anything other 

	"Nyahhh nyahh, if you don't admit I'm right you're not trying!"

	Give me a break, son.  With all your connections at Sony you ought 
to be able to drag an engineer in here to describe their development
process.  Instead of asking me to accept that a successful make counts
as a quality assurance program.
