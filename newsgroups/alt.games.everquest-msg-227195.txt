If you MOR a mob which has not be damaged by anyone, and it procedes to 
kill itself attacking someone other than you (who is not grouped with 
you) without ever being hit by real damage, do they get any exp?

I think the answer will be no, they don't, and nor do you.

Now try it again, but have them hit the mob just once.  I think the 
answer will then be, they do, you don't.

Now have the next mob kill itself on YOU, with noone hitting it at all. 
  My bet, nobody gets exp.

Now have the mob beat on you but have your non grouped buddy hit it 
(melee or spell) for just one point of damage.  My bet, he gets the kill 
credit.

In all of these cases, you should get a faction hit when the mob dies.

Now try one of the instances where the mob is beating on your buddy (I'd 
go with the one where he is also damaging it) but back well off and then 
Atone a couple times.  Now he should get the faction hit and you should not.

Its possible all this has been changed since my cleric days, but MOR 
used to act like a normal DS as far as kill credit went, which is to say 
it cause "unattributed" damage, damage that wasn't credited to anyone at 
all.

OK, now for the really amazing one.  Mob beating on your buddy, taking 
massive damage off that DS.  He hits it once, say for 50 damage.  Then 
you slap it around yourself a couple times, scoring at least 51 points 
of damage.  Even though the MOR/DS damage was 95% of the kill, and came 
from the mob hitting him, you get the kill.  This is because the DS 
damage didn't count, so he did only 50 points and you did 51+

nicely with MOR)
