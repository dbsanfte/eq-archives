Listen, it's a simple concept.

The argument was that post-50, "Endgame" players make up a small
portion of the player population.  There are several ways to see if
this is correct or not, the most direct being to actually count 50-60
players and see how they stack up against the rest of the player
population.  Thankfully, the "/who all 50 60 count" command lets us
compare the endgame population against the rest of the server.

And when we do that, we wind up with the 50-60 population being (on a
mature server, anyway) a sizable portion of the playerbase.  When
there's 2300 people on Fennin, and a /who all 50 60 count brings up a
total of 600 some odd players currently on...  Well, the conclusion is
obvious.  The "endgame" population not only makes up a rather large
portion of the player population, but in in fact overshadows the rest
of the player level range comparisons.

Honestly, I don't see how this is confusing at all.  600 players out
of 2300.  Please tell me how I'm twisting the math here.
