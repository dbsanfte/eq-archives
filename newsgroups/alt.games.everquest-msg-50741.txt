Told him that with his level he could easily get back most of what he lost
through grouping and that he should petition Verant on replacement items. I
am a former Guide and know from experience that if a player can provide
proof that their account has been hacked or otherwise violated in anyway,
"most" server GM's will give them what they call a "leg up" kit to get them
going again.

Personally, sounds to me like you got taken.
