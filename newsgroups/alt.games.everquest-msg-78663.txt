I thought the rogue epic was one of the easy ones.  Free Ragebringer in 
every box of Batwing Crunchies!  
I'm up to the final battle for my epic, then will look into the Rogue 
epic.  Several guild bards and rogues are considering going for the High 
Elf mask.  If we can spawn the general several times, we may have to 
schedule a time and just beat him senseless, again and again.  Not that I 
have any real desire to be a High Elf, but it's a lot more attainable than 
the gnome mask.
