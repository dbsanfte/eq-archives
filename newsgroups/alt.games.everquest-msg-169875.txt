If by that you mean LOIO, it can take you to 50-51, easily (with a bit 
of a narrow gap around 35-40, when normal mobs are a bit too low, but 
bloodgill goblins are a bit too high. If you hunt in the Sarnak fortress, 
you can bridge this gap.

Of course, as to being burned out with it, I fully understand, and can 
relate. :)

Castle Mistmoore has a rotten reputation for trains and bad pathing. 
Perhaps with the super-powered characters of these days, it wouldn't be 
too bad, but it has sort of already been written off by many people. 
Besides, when you are alone in the zone, you don't have to deal with 
other trains than those you create yourself. :)
