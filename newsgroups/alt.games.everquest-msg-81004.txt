Not sure what the Junk armour is but I easily levelled my bard, solo, to
high teens with very little twinking (pieces of Reinforced leather, Black
alloy, Sarny tabard) and nothing special in weapons (nothing compared to a
symphonic sabre, which I guess you mean) so the items you have sound
fine...your SBS is only good until 17 when you get dual wield, then I'd
suggest either Sainys claw (6/19 +AC about 500pp) or Sionachie's Partisan
(9/19 about 1500pp) SS boots give plenty of AC, SS armour being very cheap
now (bar BP and Greaves)

Sounds like you have plenty of decent equipment there and take into
consideration that your SS boots and SBS add upto more AC than a full suit
of whatever a normal sub 10th level bard would probably have, untwinked.
Mine only wears Fine Steel with lambent bracers, he, still, has nothing
special in weapons but then he was only ever made to test an item out  and
was only levelled to 22 to be a mule (and kill bandits for easy cash if
needed, they don't aggro after 22) kinda wish I had deleted and remade him,
putting more into strength and less of a lame name but too late now...
