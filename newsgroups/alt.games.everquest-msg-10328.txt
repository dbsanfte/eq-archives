This isn't a rant about beggers, we've all had to suffer them and all have
our own ways of dealing with them. What I am interested in is this, I have
always been under the impression that beggers get nowhere (as they get
nothing from me and so I assume anyone else) but I have recently seen a
trend of beggers that are very well equiped and I'm wondering if this is a
trend others have seen?

Eg. I get a tell from a player, Warcrye, tells me he is a 2nd level warrior
from Halas and could I spare some equipment for him, I do a who all and he's
anon...I am in FPW at this time, odd I think a bit far from home. I reply in
character about pride and wolves of the north begging from Teir'dal and I
get the expected response of "What?"
I exlplain this is roleplaying and it's my way of politely dealing with
beggers, I hear nothing further from him.

Next day, in EC, he is auctioning for a Yak, WTF? I find him, sure enough he
is a barbarian warrior, in full visible Crafted (steel looking helm, prolly
SSB) a wurmslayer and a shield (one the chitin ones) he is green to my 20th
Bard and I figure is about to or has just hit 13th so will have dual wield
now/soon.

I have seen the most enviable twinks (sub 13 warriors wearing items of
cobalt and carrying a lamy) but this guy appears to have gained all from
begging, all I can think of is that he was helped by someone and therefore
thinks all high(er) level's have plat and items to burn and give freely or
he got lucky and someone gave him about 10k in plat.

Should I, now, start begging outside in Skyfire and in Sebilis? J/K :ï¿½)

CF
I may just have to ask where this guy got his kit from.
