  Whatever you say.  You've installed "hundreds of sticks of memory" so
obviously you know what you're talking about.  I've only installed three or
four, but my experience CERTAINLY hasn't been that it's as easy as plugging
in a lightbulb.  The first time I installed new memory, it caused my system
to crash at boot up.  I know I used the proper type of memory, but still
don't know exactly what was wrong.  Maybe some sort of voltage issue, or
maybe there was a difference in CAS latency between the two modules.  I
dunno.  But whatever went wrong, I was too stupid at the time to figure it
out and threw my hands up in frustration and assumed my module defective
(though it probably wasn't).

  When I opened on my sister's HP, it was just a maze of crisscrossing
ribbon and power cables.  I couldn't even SEE the motherboard.  So of
course, it's seldom as easy as just opening up the box and sticking in the
memory.  Depending on the layout of the case and motherboard, it may be
difficult to physically plug in the memory unless you take the motherboard
out first.  And if you've never installed memory before, the fact that you
have to press down on the stick pretty damn hard to get to snap in to place
sometimes can be scary, given how thin and fragile the memory itself looks.
And of course you're going to NEED to unplug all those ribbon cables, and
figure out where to reconnect them again.  All of this is not exactly
child's play for somebody who isn't computer savvy, or even for somebody
who's used computers their entire life but seldom has done anything with the
PC's innards.

  And yeah, you can spend a lot of money and have the stuff installed for
you, but that was the point of my message: it's not as CHEAP AND EASY AS
PEOPLE SAY.  It may go off without a hitch, but be honest, for non-technical
computer users, things seldom do go off without a hitch, and if you want the
pros to do it for you, very likely the "cheap" aspect of your upgrade just
went out the window.
