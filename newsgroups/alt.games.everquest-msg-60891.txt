You would indeed have died, as some of the army giants do run SOW fast,
others can cast root on you,  and the coldain are simply unable to handle them.
Good call here.

While your insistance after nearly dying that the monk (body dragger
class) bring his own body up to you was certainly a good idea,
if you know the zone (and I know that you do not) its quite simple
for a cleric to get to the city area.  Just run to the pit, cast DA
(or DB here, you having burned DA on the way in) and jump.  Its
a 10,000 point fall, so you can ignore that, and the 30 orcs who start
pounding on you, and just jog to the city, where the quite efficient
coldain guards will eliminate all the orcs for you.  Bloody things are
only in their low 30s, unlike the train of 50 or so level giants you
pulled to the zone in.  There is, however, no room at all for error
if you don't have SOW on, as those orcs catching you before you
make the city will make mincemeat of you, level 52 or not.
