   I have to vote for fried, also.  Take one can of spam, rinse off goo. 
Slice thinly, fry up till brown and crispy on both sided.  Eat on toasted
white bread with ketchup.  Lettuce too, if you happen to have any.

   I like the taste well enough, though it could be a bit less salty.  But
I do have a bit of a problem with the texture.  It's... it's *spongy*.   I
can get past that, but only once a year or so.  Helps to be very hungry and
drunk.
