If it helps, the US army has wiccan chaplains, and several wiccan 
services in the standard training given to all chaplains.

My wife's father insists, however, that its a cult.

As an atheist, I'm merely theoretically outraged at hearing a member of 
one religion put down the beliefs of a member of another.

I do recall, however, with some amusement, that when she came out of the 
broom closet, he said "well at least you aren't an atheist".

Funny stuff that.
