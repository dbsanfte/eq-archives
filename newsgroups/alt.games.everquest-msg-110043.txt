If you're running Luclin, you need as much memory as you can throw in, but 
your graphics and CPU could use beef-ups too, in that order.  If you're not 
running Luclin, I'd do graphics, then CPU, then memory.

The only other thing about that is that it'll be hard to upgrade your CPU 
to anything decent without having to buy new memory.  Any modern CPU will 
want either PC133 SDRAM, DDR, or RDRAM.  It'll also want a new motherboard.  
I'm guessing you're running PC66 or PC100 SDRAM.  I wouldn't waste too much 
money expanding with that; I'd just save it towards a more complete 
upgrade.

Oh, and yes, what other people said...the GeForce3 Ti200 is your best bang 
for the buck right now, though you may want to see what happens with the 
GeForce4 Ti4200 hits the market.  It may drive the prices of the GF3 Tis a 
little further down.
