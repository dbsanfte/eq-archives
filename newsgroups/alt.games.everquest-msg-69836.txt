I play a lvl 20 nuker as well. and thats what they are. Nukers. at lvl 20
Force shock does 171 damage. It does get resisted in LOIO occasionally but
thats going to happen with any class. Generally all i ave to do is put the
LFG tag on a shout once and i have at least one group sending tells.I did
solo my wizard up to level 16 in northern ro and the oasis of marr. Wizards
kick ass. Not sure i would go with a darlelf though being they are kos alot
of places and getting your faction up in faydwer is easy. just my thoughts.
