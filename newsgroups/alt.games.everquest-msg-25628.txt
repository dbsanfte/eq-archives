Well, being a High Elf, that pretty much puts Bronze plate out of the
equation...

There are some good AC, low weight armors available for plate/chain
classes.  However, these will be fairly expensive for you for a while
yet.  As for right now, chain will serve you well, especially if you
group a lot, and as a cleric, you most likely will.

In the meantime, look for good deals on Fine Plate/Ulthork Hide/Tizmak
armors.  I think the AC on Ulthork/Tizmak is comparable to banded, but
at a much lower weight.

you're best off with 1hb. After a while you wont' be meleeing much
anyway, so it doesn't really matter if you get a 2hb with good stats
anyway, you can just switch them out.  For now, I'd go with 1hb and
try to get a shield for your offhand.
