Been away for about 2 years (after having played it since release).  Bought 
the titanium edition to catch up, which gains me a couple expansions and 
hopefully I wont need to download so much patch.  Where can I go to get good 
information about classes/skills etc?  I still have all my old favorites 
websites saved, but many are no longer up and the official everquest website 
seems to be more advertising than information center.  I'm leaning toward 
monk or rogue, but still open to change my mind.
