For me the cryptic shorthand does not really bother me as long as manners
are used.
Of course as a role playing game i would like to see something to the effect
of:
"Beggin your pardon sire, but my fleetness of foot is failing. Would thou
have anything to remedy
this situation?" However I, like so many others, are slow typers and this
would take quite some effort,
a simple "may i have a sow plz" would also work.  The word "please" in any
of its denominations
is good enough for my help any time, and as I am not a greedy person
donations are always turned
away.  However, to the half question "Sow me" or some form of it my reply
will always be "Donate to me"
