Mesmerization is an aoe mez that mesmerizes the target and up to 4
other mobs near the target.  The caster can also mez themselves with
this one.  Duration is about 28 seconds.  Like all mesmerize spells,
if the target takes damage, it will "wake up".

Color shift/slant/flux line is a PBAOE (point blank area of effect)
stun that affects an unlimited number of targets in a certain radius
around the enchanter.  Duration is short (4 ~ 8 seconds depending on
level) but mobs that are stunned can be damaged without becoming
"unstunned".


Mobs that are currently mesmerized can't be stunned, but stunned mobs
can be mesmerized.
