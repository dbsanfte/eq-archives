Does this just apply to the base starting stat?  If I am able to use items
to boost it over 75, does this AC penalty still occur?  When I made my SK, I
only had 70 base agility and I did not add anything to it (didn't really
know much about the stats at the time).  Having just made 30 with him I am
reluctant to re-create him but do not want to have a below average
shadowknight at later levels.

Thanks,
Charles
