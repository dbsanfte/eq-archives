Well if your going to go for random slayings might as well do it right . Any
joe schmo 8 year old can go down to the corner gas station and fill up a
couple of milk jugs with gasoline . Can then walk up to any high rise
building open the door insert jugs , light and walk away . Could probably
get a nice body count of 500 or so . That must mean that gasoline needs to
be banned . God help you if an intelligent person gets a hankering for some
terroism or creative suicide , what hey could do is really frightening .

Guns dont kill people , people kill people . Guns are an equalizer . Dosent
matter how strong and mean that rapist is if the little woman is packing and
prepared . It has been conclusively shown that widespread firearm ownership
by responsible adults dramatically reduces all crime in an area . It is too
bad that the touchy feely crowd is so willing to ignore science and math in
there quest to do the "right thing"
