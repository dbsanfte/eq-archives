Despite my gender, I am finding it harder and harder to multitask.   Visit
my guild's web page, and take note of our swanky new logo...I'm the one at
the bottom sleeping with my hat over my face. Why? Because I'm constantly
distracted.  People are always chatting at me in tells, distracting me
with gossip and exciting new lewtz they have to link, and it's starting
to become a running joke how easy it is to get aggro off me because I
always seem to be "somewhere else".  A ranger! Unable to keep aggro!!  I
could die of shame.

So obviously I need to stop being such a social person in game, but
seriously...am I the only one who becomes completely ineffective when I
talk to people?  I've also noticed an inability to watch HP bars when I
melee.  People don't let me practice weapon skills as my baby cleric yet
because as soon as I hit auto-attack my brain clicks over to "I'm a melee,
I don't watch health". BUt that's another story...conditioning will fix
that.

Are there any classes that one can be semi-competent in and still be
chatty? Folks say cleric, but I'm afraid about that...I'm sure I'll get
someone killed that way.  The way it stands right now, I'll only get
myself killed while the druid and shaman who watch my arse gate away
laughing.
