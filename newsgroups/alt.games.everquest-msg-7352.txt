Experience for killing mobs is based on levels.   And /con is the only way you
have of telling what level a mob is, so yes.

There are always differences.  First, yellow con means 1 or 2 levels above
you.   If it is 2 levels, it will be harder and worth more experience, but
likely be harder.  Second, certain monsters are harder than others.   Beetles
in North Karana can be killed by anyone while still yellow, while a yellow
griffawn (or even a blue) will hand you your ass on a platter.  Both "yellows"
would be worth the same amount of experience though, despite one being much
harder to kill.

Keep in mind though that the extra experience you get from killing yellows or
whites generally isn't worth the effort.   In the amount of time that it takes
you to barely kill a yellow, then heal and meditate back to full, you could
have killed two or more blues, and gained perhaps 50% more experience than the
lone yellow kill. (and twice the loot)

The mobs in Lake of Ill Manners are well separated by level.   If you stay
between the front of the fort on your left as you come down from Firona Vie
and the windmill, you will have pretty much nonstop monsters wandering solo in
the 15 - 18 range.

At level 16 you can group in Ill Manners quite easily, although finding a
group that believes you can help out enough might be a challenge (the idiots
will sometimes tell you no and hold out for a level 17, as if that makes *all*
the difference (but no, I'm not bitter :P))    As a druid you will probably be
able to solo there as well, which my rogue could not really do.    There will
be plenty to fight, it just depends on how much downtime you are willing to
put up with.
