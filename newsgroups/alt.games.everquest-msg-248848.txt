If he/she is smart enough, wants to learn, and is willing to commit
time to beating it.. nothing stands in his/her way. In case you
haven't noticed.. uber guilds aren't exactly that exclusive a club
anymore and your basic gear-set isn't that hard to get. If you have an
even halfway decent rep on server from groups, show you know what you
are doing in raid, and get to know the people in guild through your
typical app process.. pretty much any level 65 character with 100-200
AA can get a tag and start getting time rot loots. Hell.. if you're a
cleric they'll practically insta-tag your ass.

The reason a lot of 'average' people won't see it is due to time
considerations and desire. You have a good year from scratch for the
average player to generate the above character, or ebay one of the
many being sold and take a 2-3 month time to crash-course yourself in
learning the character.

And i'm sure they have more expansions coming down the pipe to cater
to that... but don't expect the best of the best in gear from it.

Valid concerns with the number of non-renewels, but different issue
than endgame in a normally populated server. I hesitate to use the
term cancellations because really the accounts are just laid dorment.
If for some reason EQ actually does rise from the 'death' via major
surgery on GoD by SoE i'm sure they'll come take a look-see. As per 15
hours a week... yeah most endgame isn't structured for you.

You are a 'tag-along' until you phase your character up through drops.
That doesn't take long these days.. especially with groups who have
long since mastered something since they don't need the drops. It
doesn't take you long to be geared up and being a viable member at
that which they are finding challenging.

Take the Rathe Council. There were issues that pop up deep in the
event as a side-effect of the unusual structure of it. How do you just
bird-dog something that will come up 3 hours into the event? And
should SoE sit and train people to play the characters so they can try
for hours on end to master the tactics needed to complete it in order
to ensure that it can be completed as designed? If you have 72 people
getting paid 6.75 an hour(min wage in cali).. that means your testing
for an event is gonna be $486/hr. Unless you have active players do it
in beta.. and then you still get reamed from people bitching you gave
them a leg up on progression when being the first to accomplish
something is extremely critical in EQ.

Ya.. through massive and complete wipe. The easiest way to prevent
zerging is to not leave it an option in the design of an event. The
elemental gods were a great example.. on each one of them if you zerg
you die or run out of time.

You need only be elemental or so to one-group Velious endgame.

Personally.. if you ask me.. if they know the characters, which can be
learned by casual play... casual player X sets aside a couple months
of evenings where they can put in 30 hours a week, ebay a 65 with
100-200aa.. app an uber guild.. get the rot loots from time/god..
deguild and go to playing casual with a mack character. Then you can
go one-grouping Velious endgame all you want on a casual timeline.

Or just ebay one of the many new GoD level characters soon to hit the
market :>.
