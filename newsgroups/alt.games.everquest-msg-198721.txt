We aren't seriously uber, just used to doing things with the folks
we have on hand at any particular time and pushing it to the limit. :)

Feign pull is really not needed in either of those areas. PoN caves
are mostly static with a few roamers (die warping bats).  The statics
are really not that closely packed in there.  IIRC there's one spot
near the drop off after the water where if you do something really
retarted you might get 5.  Also!  both zones are outdoor, Harmony
is your friend.

On the cleric spiders, get them slowed, have pally off tank 
and stun the crap outta them, rest of group kills the  other
or off tank the non-chealer and gank the cleric.

Nah, all the way to Hobgoblin Anguish Lord spawn can be done if
you play smart.
