Looks like I struck a nerve. First of all, call me whatever you want, I
don't really give a shit, because I know you have no clue what you're
talking about. Second of all, yes, you do own your time, but not the
product of that time. Keep arguing, and you'll just further prove how
little you actually understand about real life.
