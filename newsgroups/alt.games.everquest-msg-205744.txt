Seb NG is a nice cash camp, old world so you don't have to be POP ready to
handle it.  Better, try seb Crypt, where you are camping 6 different named who
drop items of real cash value assuming you have a bazaar mule you can hang it
on.  In either camp there's a fixed number of mobs, so doing the camp with as
few people as possible is the way to make the most money.  For a full group,
try going to POG, "yard trash" mobs yeild lots of blue diamond plus there may
be some velious level cleric plate drops you can get lucky on, unlike
KD/HOT/WTOV you don't need any faction or gems to do quests for it, it just
drops ready made.

That said, you could get yourself a full kit 2000AC and you'd still get
hammered in the planes, POP mobs hit -hard- and clerics aren't on the same
defensive table as ... I was going to say as other plate classes but instead
I'll say warriors, SK, paladins; Bards seem to be on the same "looks like
plate, protects like paper towels" table.

A better plan will be to work on your "not getting hit" skills.  Single best
purchase a cleric can make for POP action would be a pony; most of the zones
are outdoors, and sit aggro is your worst enemy.   Without a horse (or
Drogmor) you end up standing a lot which really cuts measurably into your mana
regen.

Something else you can do is make a point of getting a agro reducing item off
a mage before you head in to a POP zone; these are no rent summoned items, so
you'll need a new one each time you log in, but they can help save you some
grief.
