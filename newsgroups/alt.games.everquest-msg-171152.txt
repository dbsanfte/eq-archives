I traveled around porting my cleric on my druid, rezzing randomly for free
and porting for free.  Then again, I do this a lot, so it wasn't a holiday
spirit thing.. this is how I enjoy the game :).  Oh, and I learned how to
quad kite yesterday on my druid.  Now I know what all the talking is about,
4 kills with 2 blue bubbles of mana.. insane.
