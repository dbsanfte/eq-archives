I have noticed that if mouse is in the upper left hand corner of the 
screen at the EULA and I leave it there even for a minute...my systems 
will lock up, happens on 3 different machines so I don't think it's my 
end. Never really happened until sometime after Luclin and still 
happens, at least it did it on Wed. Not really a big deal but just a 
pain if you go to grab a beer or something and don't make it back in time :(
