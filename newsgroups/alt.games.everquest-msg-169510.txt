Do you?

Does anyone know for sure?

Its about money, not pride. Thats why he mentions
money, and not pride.

This is by no means settled. There are a lot of
people who believe, and with good reason, that
Jesus was not referring to a city gate at all, but
handing out a metaphor of how difficult it would
be for a rich man to enter heaven.

I don't know one way or another, but if you have
definite proof, then there are a lot of Bible
scholars who would be delighted to put this matter
to rest.

An extraordinary conclusion, especially in light
of what happened a few verses before. 

The story is about wealth, not pride.

The contortions that Christians have to go through
to avoid guilt about their wealth are one of God's
less well known miracles.

The list of examples is endless.

Here are just a few of the problems facing them.
