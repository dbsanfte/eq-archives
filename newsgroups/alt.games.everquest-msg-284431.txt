Next question:
I browsed through the spells on Allakhazam and noticed that there
weren't very many charm songs.  In fact the charm songs they had looked
downright gimp once you get to higher levels.  The first two charms let
you charm mobs quite a few levels higher than you.  But after you hit
level 37 (charm up to 51), there are no more charms until level 64?
And the level 64 charm only works up to level 57?

Is that right?
