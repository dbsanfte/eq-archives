Your doing it wrong, Get a 10 slot bag, In there put 2 stacks of each
component in a line downwards.

Now open your fletching kit and move them next to each other.

move mouse to first stack and keeping CTRL key held down at all times. Click
first stack drop one bit into kit, Click 2nd stack and drop bit into
kit..... blahh.. all 4 bits in kit now combine and drop arrows into auto
equip area. Rinse and repeat until all stacks used up.
