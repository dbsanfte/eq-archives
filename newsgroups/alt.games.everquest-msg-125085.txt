Ah, yes. Now I recall it. Yeah, CS people responding to players will
generally *always* be in the least public way possible. /tell will be
the default as long as dealing with one person. Switch to /say if it's
more than one, but gathered together in a small area. Always try to
avoid /ooc or /shout because you don't air out all the CS issues and
resolutions that way.

The giveaway on Conquest was the GM answering in /say something that was
said in */guild*. he he.  That should have been a tipoff for them. ;-)

Acutally talking to the guild in /gu I believe you will find to be a
court of last resort, *very* rare thing, but other incidents of it have
been reported and captured with screenshots before. (There's at least
one in the repository over at Steel Warriors from some frakus in VP one
time. I should go look for that.)

Anyway, probably such a rare fucking occurance as to be almost legend,
but yeah, it happens. And while I can't swear to it in court, I'm pretty
sure that you have to be one of the ones with your ass seated in San
Diege getting a Sony paycheck to do it.
