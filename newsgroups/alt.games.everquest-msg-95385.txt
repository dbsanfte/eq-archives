    I'd be annoyed if the fire pet just cast, because it casts moronic
spells like wizard NPCs cast. The last thing I need is a pet chain-casting
one of the easiest spells to resist in the game (Force Shock). It also
doesn't have the awesome damage shield the 49 and lower fire pets do, but
rather casts O'Kiel's Embers on itself. And not that often, thanks to the
pet buff nerf (see the letter on the Dev boards for details).

    No, see above. Stupid thing casts quite possibly the dumbest set of
spells ever.

    This wouldn't be an issue if the water pet at 54 was either on a vendor
or a normal drop like the other 51-54 spells. Instead it somehow got put on
the high level spell drop tables. You want the water pet? Go do Juggs. And
if the mage is just there for damage output, picking the pet that has
markedly lower damage is quite counter-productive. You'd have to run numbers
to see if the increase in damage output of one damage dealer reduces
downtime by as much as having stuff Rooted increases it - both effects are
pretty marginal, I'd imagine.

    My 30 mage always uses focused water. Big HPs, good AC (especially with
summoned armour on), and solid damage output. I don't use pet heals much
yet, which is why I avoid fire (even though I do have my Torch). If I ever
start farming stuff I'll go with Fire for sure, though.

> What pet is the epic?

    The epic pet is the epic pet. He's got a whole host of features from all
of the pets, so you can't really classify him as just one type. The epic pet
has a load of HPs, casts a 50 point damage shield on itself, does a powerful
cold nuke-proc every six seconds, does a stun with damage every twelve
seconds, and has a pretty hefty inherent AC (it actually is summoned with No
Drop, No Rent armour already on it). The epic pet is a beast that eats any
other pet in the game alive, not counting a Dire Charmed/Charmed mob. The
craziest thing I've ever seen was an epic pet that had been given two Yaks -
it was a monster. It also has solid resists, but none of the actual
near-immunities other pets have (Fire-fire, Air-cold, Water-poison,
Earth-disease). Near-immunity seems to = 255 in the relevant resist - they
can get hit by that type of attack, but almost never do.

    Dyzil's was supposed to be a "throwaway" pet, something you cast when
you wanted to flee, but because of some of its properties can be used as a
soloing pet. It has the properties listed above, and every six seconds or so
casts an AoE damage spell (minor damage) that also increases hate by 100
points. It is tough to taunt off of, fast casting if you chain pets (eight
seconds) and deals lots of non-attributed damage shield damage, hence the
use when soloing.

> Also, how do the monster summoning pets compare to regular
> pets?

    They don't. Monster pets don't cast spells, are resistant to disease
like an Earth pet, and sometimes damage shield themselves like a fire pet.
They won't wield weapons handed to them. They're good as "tank" pets against
stuff that won't be affected by the spells the other pets cast.

    They just like getting something with a cool graphic. :-)
