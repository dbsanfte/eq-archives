I don't know what page you're looking at.  Magelo's homepage won't load
in either Netscape 4.7x or in Netscape 7 because of javascript errors. 
The homepage is coded for IE only.  I can still view profiles in
Netscape 7, however.

By the way, it's Netscape, not NetscRape.  Your use of the latter only
makes you look like a fucking idiot.
