Not all researched spells can be bought It does seem like the other classes
get a few more researched spells available to them from vendors. Best thing
to do if you don't want to put the time into research, is to get the
components. Next start looking for a high level Necro with researching
skills and pay him to combined them for you. The most my Enchanter has
charged was 100p for 15 spells took me a total of 3 minutes
