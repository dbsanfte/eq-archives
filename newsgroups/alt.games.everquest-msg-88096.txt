Ok please ignore my last post , I have sorted the problem.. Sry for jumping
the gun hehe..

finally, after 20plus hours of fiddling, I;ve gotten back into the game.

Ill give a brief rundown of what happened, just incase it might be usefull
for others.

After emergency patch day before yesterday, I was locking up at the patch
screen. I re-installed, and then found I was locking up  after server select
screen. Tried chat tech help, pretty useless.

I then decided to run a thorough, instead of previously only doing standard,
scandisk on the drive that contains EQ (i have it seperate from everythin
else) and running that would lock my pc up too. Ran it again and again, and
it locked up at  same spot each time. So I assumed that particular section
on that particular drive was fekked. (any thought on how to fix that? is it
a take it out and have an engineer sort it job?)

So I then re/installed EQ again on a different drive. And hey presto,
sorted..although the patcher did give me some grief.

It really threw me especially as game wouldnt work right after patch...
So... all is well again...

Cheers

Kev
