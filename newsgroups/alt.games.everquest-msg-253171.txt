It sounds, to me, a lot like many cases of suicide.  I've personally had a 
bad time with that, I remember one particular week in which 4 different 
people I knew all tried to OD on different things... Nobody actually died, 
though.  Basically, I hid in my room and didn't come out for a month.  But 
when I did, I found out from I-can't-remember (since this was over a 
decade ago) that apparently this happens quite a bit... One person does 
something phenomenally stupid, and it gives other people in their social 
group the idea, sort of a 'cluster effect'.  But in many cases it's iffy 
whether the person -actually- wanted to kill themselves, or it was a plea 
for attention.  They may even have seriously thought they were going to 
kill themselves with 75-odd tabs of acetaminophen, even though that just 
means they're going to have to have their stomach pumped.

But I guess what I'm trying to get at is, a person committing suicide or, 
in this case, 'social suicide', probably generally hasn't thought about 
the grief-and-sadness aspect, and that cerainly isn't their intent.  They 
generally seemed quite suprised anyone actually -noticed- what they did.

I bet this person was similarly suprised anyone noticed enough to care.
Not that that's an excuse, mind you, it's still fairly reprehensibly 
stupid.  But punishing them for it is probably just as rewarding to them 
in a negative-attention way as the grief and sadness was.  It's like 
trying to punish a masochist.  Good luck. :)
