What level do you bard types get that healing or regen song or whatever
it is?  This guys obviously wasn't the brightest bulb on the tree, but I
guess I can see how he might ask a bard for a heal since ya'll get one
eventually. The SoW.... well, ok. That's just fucking silly. Unless he
actually expected you to group up and run him someplace with Selos
playing. I wonder how many bards actually get hit with that type of
request compared to druids getting asked for SoW?
