I'm in that category too, but I haven't picked up WoW. From what I'm
hearing though, some of the same bad issues of EQ1 are showing there head
now (see the c.s.i.p.g.r thread on the new patch) such as higher levels
farming greys and such. I'll most likely give it a try, but I'm becoming
more independent of *any* game's entrapment. EQ2 lasted less than a month
with me where before (with EQ for example) I would have gone back and
played because there really were no alternatives that could capture me.

Some of those flaws also turn off EQ1 diehards. I'm in no games camp now.
I'm playing AO (again) and enjoy it to a point. I might pick up the new
DAoC Catacombs expansion (my wife likes the new models) and see if that
holds me any length of time again. It's strange that one game can make you
compare everything else against it. EQ will always be that way to me -
every other game gets compared to how long EQ held me.

I put instant coffee in a microwave and almost went back in time.
