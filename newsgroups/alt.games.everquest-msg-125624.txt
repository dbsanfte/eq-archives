Yes, in raid situations you "junk buff" first.  You get 4 or so buffs that
it doesn't matter if they go away, and then you get all of the good buffs,
so any mob that casts a spell of the 'Cancel Magic' line will not get any of
the good buffs.  Naggy raids always spend about the first half hour doing
thing, hehe.  So yes, if you buff yourself, and then click off the first one
in that window, when you get a spell (root, lets say) cast on you, and you
cast cancel magic, that will be the first to go.  Now, there are higher
level spells in that spell line, such as "strip enchantment", which can take
off multiple spells, so be careful when you cast these on yourself that you
don't take off too many, but also, cancel magic won't work on high level
spells unless you cast it a couple times.  You have to find a balance.
