I'd like some opinions as to something that happened the other day.

Scenario:
I was in a group killing giants along the right wall at the giant
fortress in Frontier Mountains.  The group was going nicely and we had
a slot open for another person and an "enchantress" was added in.
Immediately she starts ragging how HOW we pull........ saying we
should pull more than 2 at a time and how often we are pulling.  We
are all mending, medding and she pops up and goes out and grabs one,
all the while screaming "HELP ON ME" as she's bringing him back to us
- and hell no, she is not the designated puller.  A few minutes later
we are fighting a craig and a brae, two tumps join in and it's ugly.
The melee's are taunting like mad to get the giants off the cleric and
the enchantress and then I see the enchantress say, 'Logging cant risk
losing exp..bye plus its late'.  And she disbands and gates.  So,
basically she had the benefit of being in a group and bailed when it
got risky.  

Impression:
I can deal with the whining, even the ragging.  She definitely started
to piss me off when she started pulling and by logging she pretty much
made herself most undersirable in a group as far as I'm concerned.
I'll never join a group if she's in it nor will I stay in a group if
she is invited in... no matter how good the exp or the loot.  I can
understand if the group leader tells us all to haul ass and a caster
gates out but DURING a fight?  To me it's not the same thing.

Question:
Is this a common practice?  I'm relatively new to the game and it's
the first time I encountered it, but then I've soloed or paired all
but maybe 3 or 4 levels.  Am I out of line in feeling this?

No psychoanalysis necessary, just a little insight.

Thanks in advance, to those of you who shall comment.
