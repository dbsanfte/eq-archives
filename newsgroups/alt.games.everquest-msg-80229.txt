Most all Weapon procs fire automaticly and random. The more you hit the
better the chaces of a proc firing. Also most weapon have a minimum level
before the proc if that is the case you will get a message "your will is not
strong enogh to command this weapon"  some of the exception a Smoldering
Brand, Venomous Axe of the Velium Brood, and a few other weapons that proc
at level 1.
