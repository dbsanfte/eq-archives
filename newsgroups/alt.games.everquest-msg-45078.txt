Yep, you an do that in Mozilla. Block all pop-up windows and totally 
disable the window.open() funtion so you never have to pick and chose or 
see a bunch of pop-ups flash open or anything. However I choose to just 
disable the ones in onload and onunload because sometimes webmaster put 
pop-ups to good use or something needed to see sertain things in the 
website or something (i.e. zooming in screenshots). Whatever your 
preference. You don't need to go out of your way to download extra stuff 
like that with Mozilla ;) It has built-in features like that.
