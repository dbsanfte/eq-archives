I was thinking that might be the way. It seems like there is quite a lot of 
interest in tradeskills of late. It's nice to see so many having fun with 
that now improved part of the game. I know I've been enjoying a quiet break 
from killing mobs, etc. with friends or solo exploring or whatnot. 
Personally, I love Abysmal Sea with the sounds of the ocean and soft moody 
music and banter among the npcs. It's a nice quiet place to relax and do 
millions of combines... ha ha.

Thanks for the ideas. I think I will part with some tradeskill stuff while 
doing AA in HoH and see how that goes.
