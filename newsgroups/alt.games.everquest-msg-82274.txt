If I were actually breaking a law knowingly then, yes, I would take my
ticket like anybody else. However, I've been harassed by police just
because I've had long hair and I guess they don't like people looking
like musketeers. That is something I will not tolerate. If I'm not doing
anything wrong I do not expect to be bothered.
