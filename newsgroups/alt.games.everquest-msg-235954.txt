Playing an Enchanter is certainly an excellent way of seeing those
places you would not normally be able to go. You will also be able to
use all the merchants in the enemy towns too which is a bonus over the
Rogue's Hide & Sneak method.

Be aware that zoning will make your illusion drop. Best bet is to use
invisibility before zoning in. Zone in and then find a quiet
out-of-the-way place to put the illusion up.

The short time after you zone in invis is scary but fun as the
unreliability of invis could deliver you into the jaws of death at any
moment. I remember zoning into Neriak (I'm a High Elf) invis while
doing the Enchanter Tash spell quest. Heart-pounding stuff as the
thought of a corpse recovery using the same invis + illusion tactic
that just got me killed was quite scary. As it was my invis didn't
drop and I found the coin with no problems :)

Having said all that. If you are new to EQ then an Enchanter is
probably not the best class to play for your first character.

Whatever race & class you pick I hope you have fun with it.
