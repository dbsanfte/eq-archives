I use a different address for most purposes and have my mail server set 
up to drop them all into a master mailbox.  If I buy something from XYZ 
corp I tell them my email address is XYZspam@... for example.  I do this 
for ease of telling who sold my address to spammers.  If I suddenly 
start getting spammed at that XYZ address I then set up a rule to 
forward mail for that address to the customer service address of XYZ, 
but I've had really good luck with this tactic and most of my spam 
addresses are not spammed heh.  I think list builders filter them out as 
bogus addresses even though they are valid.

I also use a spamblock in my address when posting here, but have left it 
out of a post a few times.  Just from those times the th@ addy has been 
scraped from this group.  Well unless someone out there is manually 
scraping this group, but that seems a bit far fetched.

Bottom line, when spammers die they will envy the upside down popes 
their comfy circle of hell.
