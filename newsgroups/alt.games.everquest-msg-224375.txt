LOL boy do I know *that* feeling.

Aye, less strong but as you and others point out, there aren't a lot of
better alternatives. Too bad, really, if John's estimates are true (and it
sounds like they are), that 80% of players are picking these two, it's
become too cookie-cutter.

Really good question! I do indeed have Stoicism and I rely on it heavily,
both for my own mana weaving and also as my fastest heal in appropriate
situations. It does add a new element to the equation. But I think my answer
is "Yes".

Very true but in the spirit of "every little bit helps" I will usually
assume bear form when acting as healer for a group, so I guess I'd apply the
same kind of thinking to this. I've gone to greater lengths to secure tiny
advantages here and there so this just seems like another one of those
investments that one hopes will have a demonstrable effect over time.

Unfortunately, *this* seems to be the most compelling argument so far, lol!

I don't have any idea either. But let's share information once we do find
out. You and I are both at the same level on the same server with some
similar objectives, let's get some of the other AGE folks and see if we can
organize our own pick-up dragon raid. Is there anyone else here on AGE who
is Vox-Naggy enabled on Firiona Vie?
