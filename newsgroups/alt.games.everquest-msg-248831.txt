Correct.

You are correct.

I am not saying *at all* that EQ2 is the bane of EQ... EQ has been
mis-managed ever since SOE started stepping in an replacing Verant
(how good or bad a job Verant did, I leave for another discussion, as
it's not very pertinent), and EQ2 was not the reason (at least, I
don't *think* it was).

What I am saying is that SOE cannot fix the EQ problems (of which
there are many, and I cited examples) by releasing EQ2 because most of
them are related to SOE's managment of the game. They treat it like a
regular video game, and it's just not. So, why would I say, "oh good,
EQ2 will be a better game, I'll go play that now"?

No, I will either stop or play a non-SOE game. If EQ2 is changed, such
that it's an upgrade to EQ, and existing characters are "migrated"
(granted the system is different), then I would consider it, *only
because* it would mean that many of my friends would also go to the
"upgraded EQ".

Why would SOE not do this, then? Because they think they'll get better
retail numbers if they release EQ2 without an established player base
(who wants to buy a game when everyone else is level-whatever and has
good gear?) I understand this, but what I'm trying to say is that
releasing EQ2 in this way means that both EQ and EQ2 take a serious
hit in terms of player base available to them while WoW and CoH pull
players away from both games. That's going to make it hard for EQ to
keep a crittical mass of players (already is, and WoW/CoH aren't even
out yet) needed to draw the WoW/CoH players back, should those games
not live up to their hype, while not allowing EQ2 to build that
crittical mass either...

This is as if SOE had waited until DAoC was about to be released and
suddenly banned half the player-base for a month. EQ survived the
immense hype of DAoC (though it was less than that surrounding WoW)
because of the size of the EQ player base and the draw that that
presents. How will EQ (or EQ2) survive WoW/CoH with a divided
player-base?
