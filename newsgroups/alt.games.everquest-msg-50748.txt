I hope that's not the case but I was fully aware
that it could be a scam when I decided to give it
to him.  He said he petitioned and the GM's said
there was nothing they could/would do to help.  I
don't know all the circumstances behind it.  My
thinking that for a 300pp investment I might see a
good return and was willing to take that risk.  I
haven't been to Vegas in a while so I thought I'd
gamble a bit.
