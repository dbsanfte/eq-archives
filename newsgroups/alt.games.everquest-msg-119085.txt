Did you cast nothing but a low damage snare and the fears?  Or did you
stack DOTs on as well, or do melee damage yourself?

In theory (and it sure seemed this way to me when I was running pet
classes, although its been months since I did that) if you do more damage
than your pet the hit is fairly small (the difference between 77 kills and
71 kills is larger than I'd expect too see) while if you do less than the
pet the hit is literally half (so I'd expect you to need 142 kills more or less
to do as well as the warrior.)

A possible explanation is that you normally outdamaged your pet, but
in a few cases he outdamaged you, that way the mostly 3/100ths could shoot
up to the 6/71sts by adding a few 50/100ths to average in.
