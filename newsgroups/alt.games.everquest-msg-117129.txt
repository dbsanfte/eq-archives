I took the Chimp over to Rathe Mt a few times to check it out but it was
always busy so I moved on quickly. I was very surprised to see that everyone
else on each occasion pulling the HG's from the plateau and completely
ignoring the placeholders. There were even ooc squabbles over mobs because
they were so few and far between.

Being the only 50+ in the zone one time I decided to go postal and
completely clear all the PH and within a short time I was surrounded by a
steady stream of HG's for myself and plenty more for everyone else. Of
course - morons being what they are it didn't stop them bitching about a
level 54 farming their HG and depriving them of XP - *sigh*

For a moment I intended to patiently explain in OOC how placeholding worked,
and futher explain that the resulting HG were impossible to avoid now they
were popping constantly because of my PH farming. Then my wits returned and
I just OOC'ed "terribly sorry" and left with a evil little snicker to
myself.

I am sure it didn't take them *too* long to figure out for themselves.....
