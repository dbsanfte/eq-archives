I've been using a Radeon 8500 for some months now, and it did have
some problems for a while.  Namely, while it would render 3d quite
quickly, it's reaction to either Direct X 8.1 or just EQ's graphics
engine was spotty.  I would have the textures on moving objects just
vanish, effectively causing mobs, players, NPC's and Kunark trees to
disappear randomly.  In addtion, boats were displayed very poorly,
painting the entire area around them with boat textures.

Verant fixed the boat texture problem, that's not an issue.  And with
the latest driver from ATI, the disappearing textures are a thing of
the past, leading me to believe the problem was with the card and
drivers, not the game.  

It's a good card, no doubt.  Crisp, shapr 2d images, great 3d
rendering, fast, good FPS in every shooter I own.  But ATI is NOT very
fast at creating and releasing new drivers, and there is no doubt in
my mind that most designers will be working with the more popular
GeForce line of cards in mind.  Just something to keep in mind when
you make your choice.
