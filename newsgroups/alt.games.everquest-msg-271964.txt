I have some input on AC2. My son and I have been playing AC2 for about a 
year and a half now and still love the game. They are coming out with an add 
on sometime the 1st quarter of this year.  AC2 has interesting quests, has 
plenty of crafting if that is what you like, you can do a lot of things solo 
or in fellowships or allegiances. One thing AC2 has that I like is player 
versus player areas and/or kingdom versus kingdom. I have never played EQ 1 
but am playing Everquest II. I enjoy it so far but my favorite is AC2. In 
AC2 I'm a level 57 defender and my son is a level 64 defender. He plays a 
lot more than I do.
