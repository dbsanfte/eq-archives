Listening to the desires of customers can be a double edged sword.  On the
one hand, they may think they want X, and be right, and actually become
happier customers if they get X.

On the other hand, they may think they want Y, and actually become less
happy customers if they get Y.

I suspect you're right that most EQ players, when asked, would express
they like the PoK books.  That much seems obvious since most classes can't
travel as easily as druids and wizards.  And heck, who in their right mind
*wouldn't* want some easy travel for free?

My theory is that people think they like the PoK travel system, but in
fact don't.  Okay, before you break out the flamethrowers, let me
qualify that a bit.  If you're level 60+ with lots of AAs, easy travel
really probably does make you happy.  You've done the "Explore Norrath"
thing enough that traveling the hard way is rather pointless and won't
increase your enjoyment of the game.

But newbies, who are crucial replacements due to attrition, apparently
enjoy doing many things the hard way at first.  Look at the myriad of
posts with people fondly remembering their experiences negotiating the
world of Norrath.  That kind of experience builds long time players.

The PoK does not encourage people to have those kinds of experiences.
It encourages them to play it safe, and when given the choice, most
people will play it safe.  That means safe, easy, predictable PoK travel
instead of hoofing it.  It makes the world feel smaller and much less
impressive.  This is not the way to transform new players into long term
players.

I'm truly sorry the subject tires you, Annie, but it doesn't tire me.
I find it interesting to discuss alternatives, even if they'll never be
implemented.

It's also my opinion that a great many posters to this newsgroup are
having trouble comprehending that just because many of us think the PoK
books were overkill, doesn't mean we're advocating their removal without
some kind of non-overkill replacement.
