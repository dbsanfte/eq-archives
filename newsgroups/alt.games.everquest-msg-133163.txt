Well, thats where the puller gets to have a little fun, meleeing down the
already
massively injured leftovers.  If you have gone the wizard puller route, then of
course you have a wizard handy to do this... but since we are discussing the
relevance of the wizard spell lines thats not really germane.

I think one chanter sounds nuts, myself, I like the idea of overlap.  Three
though, I'm not sure I'm that fanatical, after all there's a 96% res waiting
if I happen to die, and I'm making far more than the remainging 4% back
on a single AOE kill cycle.

The "partially resisted" part is the key here, you often get one or two mobs
lose smacking the chanter... so healer keeps him alive while he fixes that.
Second chanter better because that means less chance of those mobs managing
to interrupt cast of stun and delaying till more mobs wake up... but I can
assure
you I was regularly saving chanters from dying to unstunned mobs during the
three hours we did this.

I don't need the absolute optimal AOE group, I'm willing to accept a
group capable of handling only 50 mob pulls in relatively whimpy
zones like Chardok

I imagine Optimal group would be
3 chanters, 3 wizards, cleric camped out at the SS.

I'm not trying to throw them together randomly... as you can see from this
thread, I'm asking questions, questioning assumptions, and trying to get
the information to make informed decisions.  The difference between 12 mobs
and 60 mobs is in the number of mobs who resist, and the length of time
it takes to gather them all up (giving more instances of resists) and, hmm, the
number of "leftovers" who got enough partial resists to AOEs that they lived
thru the barrage.

I thought about 2 clerics and a druid... but as you see below the combination
I'm currently proposing is 1 cleric, 1 druid, 1 wizard

Thus, I'm asking.  Is there really a reason?  What is it?  Can we overcome it?

How about
GROUP ONE
Cleric
Druid
Chanter_01
Chanter_02
Wizard_01
Wizard_02 (epic wiz, puller)

Is that worse than
GROUP TWO
Cleric
Chanter_01
Chanter_02
Wizard_01
Wizard_02
Melee puller?

Seems to me group one actually has better damage output than group two,
although not as good as one with Wizard_03 (epic wiz, puller) instead
of the melee...

I was also specifically interested in a type two group with a bard as the
puller.  My theory here was that the bard would significantly reduce
down time between pulls, while still doing about as well as any other
melee puller as far as pulling and finishing off the odd leftover.

Here's the nitty gritty.  How much worse is cleric AOE or druid AOE than
wizard or mage AOE?  Can two healer AOErs sub for one wizard
AOEr?  I'm suggesting taking the third chanter slot and giving it to druid
instead, hoping that the druid heals will help keep both chanters alive
and that the druid will then add to damage output

I'm confused here.  You require 3 chanters.  You haven't contradicted the
cleric.  That leaves two slots open.  If your wizard is puller, then no
problem...
but if you have the monk pull then that leaves only wizard/cleric as your AOE
production.  Is a wizard and a half really adequate?  Earlier you said you have
to have two wizards...

If you have to have 3 chanters, and you have to have two wizards, and you
have to have a cleric... then there is only one AOE group construction possible,

and oh by the way you need a pulling wizard.

If you want Divine Aura pulling, hey, you have a cleric handy.  I even have -two

divine spells to use to that paladin's one!  Course now you are happy you have
the
druid along since she can heal the chanters... Cleric can pull himself between
pulls though.
