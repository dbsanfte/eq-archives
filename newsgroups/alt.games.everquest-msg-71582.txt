I've noticed lag seems to have nothing to do with my system nor my ISP.

I use EQW which allows me to run my chat programs and browse web sites while
I play. I've actually downloaded files over my 56K modem at a fair rate
while playing EQ and I didn't notice any MORE lag or link deaths than usual.
I get about 4 or 5 link deaths a night, whether I'm running EQ through EQW
or not.
