	Actually you can draw a conclusion: the law cannot be shown to reduce
handgun crimes in any given city.  (It can't be shown to reduce handgun crimes
overall, either, but you do need to look further than one city to see that.)

	Real lawmakers have known for centuries that writing things down on paper
doesn't make it so.  A guy named Lord Shang proved that one a few thousand
years ago in China (and a guy named Chin Shih Huang-ti showed a few years
later that you can't improve on the concept, either.)  We don't have real
lawmakers, though, just politicians and lobbyists who think that social
reality can be magicked out of the ether by scribing the proper incantations.
