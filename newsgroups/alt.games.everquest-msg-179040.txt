While that last is true, my 33 Druid can kill < L10 trash trivially,
at 0 (that's zero) mana expenditure.  But then I've taken the trouble
to keep his melee skills maxed (and consider ac when choosing his gear)
for exactly that reason.  Regardless, it does not in any way make the
behavior of refusing to kill PHs any less parasitic, it's just plain
fucking self-centered to go in there with a class that can kill the
HGs 3x as fast as a melee 5 levels higher than you and refuse to kill
PHs because you might miss a chance to outrun that melee to the HG
that he spawned.  But hey, its not like you don't believe that it's
cool for Druids to be assholes, right?
