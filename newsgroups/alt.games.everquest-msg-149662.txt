When I'm master looter, I keep half of all the cash loot before I split
with the group.

After all, who can tell?  Who gets hurt?

Oh wait, I'd be an utter ass if I did that, deliberately cheating the
people who trusted me.  And if anyone ever found out, my
rep would be shot.

Guess its a good thing I don't think that way.

Pickpocketing mobs that your group is killing and not splitting the
loot with them is the same thing as stealing directly from them.
