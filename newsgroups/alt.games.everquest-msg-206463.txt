    I was going to be even more pessimistic and say to avoid quadding until
34, and just snare kite. In the good old days before wizards quad kited I'd
see wizards of all levels running around snare kiting single mobs. One
favourite in Kunark seemed to be the cockatrices in various zones - I guess
they're already slow or low on HPs or something. I just avoided them while I
was doing my slow root-nuke on the caster ghosts in Trak's Teeth.
