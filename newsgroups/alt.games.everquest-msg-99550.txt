the x/330 fractions are sent when you get a kill, but every time your zone,
your player profile packet will have your lifetime exp count in it.  So
someone
with a lot of free time could just zone every time he levelled, get the raw
exp
from the playerprofile, and know that exp +/- a kill was the beginning exp
for
that level.  Repeat for every level, and you can get a pretty accurate
picture of
where each level begins/ends.
