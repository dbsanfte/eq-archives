That's what is great about Everquest. You don't 'have" to have a trade
skill. Plenty have made it to the highest levels with drinking as their
only skill. Plus those like us feed the trades folk. When I want
something I buy it I don't make it. If everyone had a trade skill the
economy would suffer. The few that can make imbued fine plate get good
plat for it.
