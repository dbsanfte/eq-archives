Well, heres the deal just because you don't find something important and
interesting does not mean that other people don't.  Also hate to tell you
this, but your vision of the game is no more important then mine or his or
hers.  See to me if EQ was your vision it would be extreemly dull.
As for your 180 people example how does that even compare with fewer then
ten people.  And if you are in an auction zone it is going to be hard to
keep up even if nobody did anything but auction I mean come on how much
harder can an /ooc conversation make it when the rate of the /ooc's are
about 1 to every 10 /auctions.  I would suggest that what makes the auction
zones hard to deal with is the auctioners repeating their auctions every 30
seconds to a minute.  People for some reason think that the more often they
auction the more chance they have of selling, well yeah if another 50 people
didn't have the same idea.  So explain to us again how 15 or 20 /ooc
messages(by multipul people) in a half hour makes the chat box move all that
much faster when compared to 50 people each reapeating the same thing 20+
times in the same amount of time.
Personally when I am in EC and a good /ooc gets going I turn off my auctions
so I can follow the /ooc conversation.  See and this is what I like and I
pay the same amount of money as you do(unless you are on Legends)and I have
as much right to enjoyment of the game as you do.  But to say that people
are doing something wrong by using /ooc for its intended purpose(I read the
paragraph about it in the Everquest manual) is wrong.
Besides you always have an option other then turning /ooc off, you can add
the people using it to your ignore list.  That actually sounds perfect
seeing as you find what people are saying worthless LOOK OUT HILL GIANT
BEHIND YOU!!

Okay, Bizbee your turn to rant away.
