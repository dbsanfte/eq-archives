Everybody does, although few admit it.  It's the connotation that scares
people away.

I, for example, as a heterosexual man, discriminate against other men as
potential sexual partners.  I would expect a lesbian, in her turn, to
discriminate against me as a sexual partner on the basis of my sex.  As long
as she acknowledges she has no right to tell me not to discriminate, I won't
tell her not to discriminate.  You like that word?  Discriminate.  There, I
said it again.  It's not always a bad thing.  Only when people let things
like gender, race, and the like help them choose their friends or employees
or people to beat up when they think a camera isn't pointed their way, then
these's a problem.
