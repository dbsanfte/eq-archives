Hi EQers,

This is a long time problem and I don't know if it's ever been solved,
perhaps someone can enlighten me.

A couple of problems:

1.  Packet Loss - Break-up

This is a random problem which can usually be solved with a re-boot or two
but it is still very annoying.  The lag meter will start to show packet loss
and start to look like a thin green barcode.  I can recover from this
briefly by sending a tell or /who all paladin.  Both my computers do this
but not at the same time, at different random times, so I know it's not
connection related.

2. The other problem is random lockups, and crash to desktop.  This only
occurs on the second system.  It sometimes locks up at the sony screen too.

Things I have checked:

IRQ's these are not shared.
4 in 1 drivers these are correct
Tried DX8.1a and DX8.1b
Video drivers are the recommended ones from EQ site

System Specs:

System 1
=======
AMD 1.3 CPU
Asus DDR Mobo with Ali chipset
512 Mb DDR RAM
Asus Geforce III 64Mb RAM
Soundblaster Live value

System 2
=======
AMD XP 1600
Abit Mobo with AMD northbridge controller and VIA South (Yuk!)
512 Mb DDR
Leadtek GeForce II 64Mb RAM
Soundblaster Live Value

I'm almost at the point of throwing the AMD chips and boards in the bin and
going for Intel and selling my soul to the devil - any Intel users have
these problems?  BTW I have no problems with other games including DAoC when
I tried it.

TIA,

Bah!
