The server that I play on is getting a lot of people asking for epic help
and having just recieved my epic last night (/shameless plug for self) I
would like to share a few things.
Asking for epic help is GREAT we all know that epics can not be done by just
one person, however if you are going to ask for epic help.... please make
sure you have done your homework. I realize that you won't know exactly how
to do your epic, noone does for there first epic. There are lots of good
sites out there for epic walkthroughs, check some out. I did my druid epic
last night and got most of my information from www.eqdruids.com which has an
excellent walkthrough and I was able to sound intelligent when I asked for
epic help (i.e. I knew what zone the mobs were in, what I had to do and who
I had to turn things into.
Last night while I was getting my VSR piece we had an "uber guild" come in
and try to ks us and it boiled down to our guild got one stone as did
there's. I got my stone and was running around doing my last three turn ins
when I get a /tell from Uberguildweenie001 "Hey how do I spawn fay?" no
problem I think to self and answer "you turn in Froglok Essence from Ulump
Pujik in to Dolgin Codslayer and it spawns fay" a minute or so later I get
"Who is Ulump Pujik" and I answer "a 55 froglok warrior in swamp of no hope"
and think little else of it. I then get a /tell from above mentioned
uberguildweenie asking "do you think Ulump is up now?" This person was a
druid and was quite capable of going to see for themselves. My point is...
before you assemble a raid force to go in and try to ks a rarer piece for
the epic KNOW WHAT ELSE YOU NEED! do not rob someone of the piece when that
piece may be there last piece (like it was mine) and then they have to go
through the raid again when you have done none of anything else you need in
order to get your epic. Do your homework before assuming "I'm in an
uberguild and I get this piece because I say so who cares that I have no
idea what to do with it" and if I have tread on someones toes GOOD because
my story struck a nerve and maybe you should consider how you are towards
others who have put the time into LOOKING UP how to do an epic.
