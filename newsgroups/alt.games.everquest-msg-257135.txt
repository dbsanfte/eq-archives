Per the EQ CLerics forum this part should be soloable.  I took my ranger in to
have a *look / see* and Ragefire wasn't up.  Everything was blue to her at 58,
and I used the *D* entrance from Sol A on EQ Atlas, and wasn't able to figure
out a way up to the castle itself.  That said:  I take it its easier to just
clear the rooms all the way down as you go and use the Lavastorm entrance?? 
Will I have to do something to spawn Ragefire?  Is this really soloable?
Am I missing something obvious?
