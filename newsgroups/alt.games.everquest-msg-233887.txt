The problem with this is that the mobs would be unslowed, any adds would be
running around at random hitting warriors, and at least one warrior would
have to sit out the next fight because of low HP.

However, replace your group of warriors with a group of Paladins....

My Paladin got invited to a group in PoV RC with another paladin (I know, I
know, two paladins...but he was a friend), and after a while both the healer
and slower had to log, and neither organised replacements. Instead of
sitting around, we decided to pull and divide agro until the replacements
arrived. Well, we had no real problems. With both of us chain-stunning the
mob, I think we "slowed" the mob about 50%. If one of our HP got a little
low, the other grabbed agro (easy enough for a paladin) and let the first
pally heal up.

Six Paladins, all chain stunning, could conceivably keep a mob
perma-stunned, and therefore doing no damage whatsoever (and any damage done
could be healed easily enough). The "get-out-of-jail-free" card that is Lay
Hands could be used in case of emergency.

With Root for crowd control, this group could do pretty well.

Any thoughts?
Has anyone tried an all-paladin group?
