Possible, but highly improbable.  It all depends on your channeling
skill check, which is helped by the level of the spell.  Lower level
spells are much easier to channel through interruptions than higher
level ones.
That being said, it's probably doubtful you'll ever see someone manage
to pass their interrupt check to the point they can cast while
running.

Depends, do you want to become a tailor?  If so, save them, you might
make something useful out of them.

>3a)  Can you gate out of battle?

Oh, yeah.  Entirely possible.  Gate is a very low level spell, as long
as you're not running about, you can easily channel it through hits.  

>3b)  If so can you do it while running from the mob?

See above. It's possible, but you stand a better chance of winning the
lottery.

Simply because you're not suppposed to move while casting.  However,
one can turn in place.
