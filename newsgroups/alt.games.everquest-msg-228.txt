I know we are told not to transfer the game or account to anyone however =
I HAVE DONE IT!!!

I AM GUILTY -=20

I purchased the game and played a character until level 5. I then =
transferred it to my girlfriend!
Will I be punished??!!

I also did the same and gave that one to my daughter. Am I to believe =
that a 9 yr old child must purchase this game on her own and use her OWN =
credit card to pay for it!!

What about the girlfriend who refused to play unless I made it easier =
for her by getting her the first few levels?

Does that mean I am evil?!??
