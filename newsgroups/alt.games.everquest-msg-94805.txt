Ok, I enter OT, join a group and start medding group songs.  OF COURSE
no-one /shouts "Goons to FM" or anything like that and I get slaughtered.  I
didn't even see it coming.
Anyways, the cleric in my group only has revive.  He couldn't find an exp
rez so I say go for it.  He tried to revive me but gets a message somewhat
like:

You were unable to restore the corpse to life, but you may have success with
a later attempt

I've only been rezzed once or twice and never had this come up, nor have I
ever heard of the clerics in my guild mention anything like this (none were
on to help me).  The cleric tried over and over again but kept getting this
message.
What gives?  Can anyone here enlighten me on my misery?

Lvl35 seems bad enough so far and this is the 2nd time someone has dumped
high level npc's on me at this level.  I've only recently tried OT and 1/2
the time I get chased out by these rotten bastards.  I assume this is from
people getting off the boat when they are KOS and running to FM.  I thought
they don't like all good races, but they ALWAYS pick me out of a group if
they run by.
1/2 elf bard worshipping Bristlebane.  Does that combination add to their
hate?

Thanks for reading my rant and for any help on my questions,
SEAN...
