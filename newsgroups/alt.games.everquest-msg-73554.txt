Actually they do.  If you go to Recipes and look at Tinkering it shows
a link to Fulcrum's Tinkering Compendium which is the EQPortal Site
that others have pointed out.  

Niami, when presented with a site which she cannot improve upon simply
links to it while often putting up minimal info.  This is the case
with Tinkering above, Fletching (Aoenla's is top notch so she links to
it), Spell Research and Alchemy.

The problem was in the "minimal looking" =)

Good luck=)
