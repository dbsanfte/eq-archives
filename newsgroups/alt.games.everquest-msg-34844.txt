You won't be able to make much money at 7th level. Gnoll fangs and rusty
weapons from BB will net you 2 to 3 plat per venture.

Things to consider once you you feel ready for them:

Rabid Grizzlys... will get you 2-3pp per pelt. They're uncommon spawns and
are often quickly killed, but as a Ranger you have a good chance of getting
to them first, and of knowing whether Miss Windstalker is in the area when
you go for a kill. However the main thing about Rabid bears isnt the loot so
much as the excellent XP.

Bandits... I guess 9th level min, before you hunt these. A druid partner
will be able to harmonise them, so you can avoid getting trashed. Bandit
Sashes will get you around 2-3pp each. XP doesn't suck. Beware half elven
bandits, beware the werewolf popping up at bandit farm.

Willowisps about 8-9pp per greater lightstone. 9th-10th level min. You'll
need a magic weapon - a gnoll lariat should be cheap to obtain. The Isle of
Eruds Crossing has the greatest density of wisps for hunting, but its often
crowded for that same reason. As a Ranger you'll be able to locate them
easily regardless. For the run to North Karana Gipsy Camp you should try to
get a SoW - you can do it without, but stay alert either way. Wisps tend to
be fairly good XP too.
