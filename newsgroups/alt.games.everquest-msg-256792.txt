I don't particularly mind that very much, but I do dislike the voice 
acting idea for a different reason: There is no way they can add, modify 
and fix quests anywhere near as fast if they need to bring voice actors 
in than if they just have to edit a text file. At the end of the day, 
we'll either have too few voice quests, or an unholy mixture of working 
voice quests, broken voice quests and text-only quests.
