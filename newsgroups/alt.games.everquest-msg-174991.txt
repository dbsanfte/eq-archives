Er, I *have* noticed, and that's the official Pentagon line too. It was 
Dennis who brought up the matter of it deterring a Russian preemptive 
attack. My line of argument was that, on top of the system not being 
designed for it, it was simply a bad idea to try and get out of the MAD 
paradigm that has worked for the last 50 years, and more so now that 
Russia is both a friendly country and involved in the very same fight 
against terrorism.

No, I tell you what happens: They get hold of an old, forgotten Russian 
missile left behind in some godforsaken republic. They remove the 
warhead. They put it in a cargo ship, they get it into New York harbour 
and they blow the city to bits. I don't disagree that they have the will 
and the mentality to do it, what I disagree with is that they are stupid, 
and from the point of view of maximum carnage, a missile (especially an 
old and unreliable or new and untested missile) is a waste of a good 
nuke.

All that money would be better off invested in stopping terrorists 
getting hold of nukes in the first place.

No, but it uses up funds that would be better invested on intelligence, 
and lulls the US into a false sense of security.
