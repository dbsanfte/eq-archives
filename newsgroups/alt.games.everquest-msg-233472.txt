Looking up all the items with Illusions at Allakhazam's takes too long.

Is there a list of all the Illusion items somewhere, preferrably with what
classes can use them listed?

I know most of the items, other than the Essence potions made by Shamans and
the Transformation potions found in chests in the LDON dungeons, are Bard
and Rogue only, but I'm mainly looking for the items that can be used by any
class. (I have a Magician and a Beastlord who would mainly be using them)
