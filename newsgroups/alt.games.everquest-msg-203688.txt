I'm a pretty new player and have some questions on how best to play in
order to manage mana effectively. Currently, I'm playing a 4th level
gnome necromancer. The issue is that my mana seems to get used so
quickly that I can only attack one mob or so before I have to rest. I
have been doing the following:

Have my pet attack the mob.
Immediately cast Clinging Darkness to keep the mob from fleeing too
fast.
Cast fear and/or poison bolt.

At this point, I don't have enough mana to do much of anything else. I
have 133 int, which is my starting max.

Any suggestions on how to best play at this level to avoid this
situation? Do I just have to deal with this until I gain a few levels?
Will this situation occur pretty much every time I gain a new rank of
spells?

Thanks,

-Rodney
