My very limited and humble opinion:  in DL, (or any other area) if someone
fails to meet your expectations you can boot them at any time.  Not so in LDoN.
 
I've done the preliminary running around, but I hold no great expectations of
LDoN adventuring.  It looks like they are geared towards groups of 4 or more
friends who are very close in level and  who can be on at the same time.  Or
guilds.  
It isn't geared towards "casual players" or soloers.  
Please let me know if I'm missing something....
