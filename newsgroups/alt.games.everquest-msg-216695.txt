Thus far I've heard of exactly no one who wasn't able to get
their characters back after as much as two year's absence.  The
cost of storing an inactive character is apparantly very small,
and the possible benefit of recapturing the lost revenue is
pretty decent.  Odds are, too, as a lot of people abandon the
game for new ones, but thus far all the other MMRPGs seem to not
be able to hold interest.

While I don't doubt they'd love to make money on people who
aren't playing anymore, most of the people who leave -intend- to
stay gone. Paying $5 a month for a game you've quit playing seems
silly.

Thats not to say someone at SOE isn't monitoring this newsgroup
right now and running off to submit his brilliant new scheme to
his bosses for making yet another fortune off practically no
work, like the fee for moving characters from one server to
another.
