Yeah, a friend of mine told me a couple of days ago.

"You win.  Your hobby is the most expensive."

This was right after her enchanter, having charisma at 180ish, and cast
whatever the spell is on the vendor, bought me one stack of each of the SoW
potion components.  She does jewelry, and has a rogue that does poison
making.  She hasn't gotten into high end jewelry yet though, her opinion
might change at that point, not sure.
