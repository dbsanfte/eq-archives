When i first went to Fironia Vie, I was thinking, gee the elves are
building a new city, thats nice. 1 year later, the city hadn't
changed..all the construction material was still in place and no new
buildings were put up. Part of the dynamics could be sublte changes
like that..new buildings, walls, tunnels etc. Lets say they want to
build a new tunnel. A bunch of NPCs have the job of digging out the
dirt and moving it. player can help dig or help move, get some plat or
experience and participate in the new project. If its a construction
project, a right click on a brick would should who placed it there.

Or mob related - if all the spiders in FV got wiped out, it would take
a quest from mistmoore (carry an egg or something) to respawn them.

I thought i heard of a zone where bands of NPC would periodically fight
over a piece of turf (a few expansions ago) but the players had a hand
in determining which side would win. Anyone recall that?
