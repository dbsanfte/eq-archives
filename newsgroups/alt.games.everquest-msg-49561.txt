This is where you're wrong.
There's only about 2 places in the game where a single group cannot
hunt.

What you're confusing is "can't hunt" vs. "won't take the risk to
hunt".

Oh give me a fucking break.
Single group between 45 to 55 can hunt:

Hole, Hate, Fear, Sebilis, Chardok, Karnor, Velk, Icewell, Kael,
Skyshrine, Western Wastes, Siren's Grotto, Dragon Necropois.

What more content do you need?
