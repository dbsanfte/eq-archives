We have a very open policy about working out problems amoung guild 
members.  If you have a problem, think something is wrong, please talk 
with an officer about it frankly.  

She never did, she just blew up one night.

Which is not the case here.  We're anything but an uber guild.  In fact, 
we are rather small, and try to do things as efficiently as possible 
because of our size.  Our MT's ac and HP have been severely bellow par for 
a while.  The better he can tank, the faster we move in HoT, the more 
armor drops we get for EVERYONE.

 A few months back, as a congradulations to this cleric getting 47, we 
took her on 2 hate raids for the purpose of setting her up with a full 
setm of Ethereal Mist. She's been hooked up with plenty of other stuff.  
But in HoT, we hadn't awarded her any plate yet (after only a handful 
raids) because we weren't moving through the mobs fast enough to get drops 
for everyone (ergo the BP auto to the tank).  Then her husband didn't get 
a copy of eagle eye.  Eagle Eye of all things.  And she blew up.

It's cathartic to rant.  And to do so in an anonymous forum away from your 
server community is the best way to do it.  And no, I wouldn't use names.
