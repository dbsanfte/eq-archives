If it was non-trivial without the gizmo, it's non-trivial with it.  That
much has been proven.

Nobody knows exactly how they modify skill, but there's a lot of
speculation.

My personal speculation is that the modifier is applied to your skill before
the skill success/fail check.

So where before, you have a success/fail chance based on (Skill Level / Item
Trivial), you now have a success/fail chance based on (Skill Level * 1.05 /
Item Trivial).

Note that this is PURE SPECULATION on my part.
