You guys are already EQ players.

So they'll buy WoW then. Given a choice between A a new game they can't 
run, B a new game they can, and C a five year old version of the first 
game. They'll pick B.

Outrage by people already playing EQ. New players never so much as 
peeped about it.

Be that as it may, and as great a game as Masters of Orion II was... its 
not going to sell many copies today. Even though it could still suck a 
couple hundred hours out of the life of anyone who gets close to it.

Similiarly EQ is a good game, but its been sitting on the shelves for 5 
years, and its got its own Sequel next to it, along with a variety of 
big name new titles. To top it off, EQ1, after you buy the expansions to 
catch it up costs more than EQ2. 

At this stage the game is almost unmarketable to anybody except former 
and current eq1 players.

And -that- is why it is 'dying'.
