All i know is that people of 4 guilds, and 1 person who claim to know 
the moron in person (hes a guy from my old guild, on my friend list, as 
soon as i mentioned a moron 6-boxing in hate he were able to name the 2 
chars the guy use as "mains". Matched the ones he used to OOC shout in), 
he should be have 8 chars he use to farm planes and HoT. Cant of course 
verify it personally of course, and since the guy got the attitude to 
start to kill us by opening HoT door and then gating out, i very much 
doubt hell like to give me any proof.
