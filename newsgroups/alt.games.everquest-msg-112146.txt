First of all, sharing an account is a violation of the EULA. It can
get you banned. Note I'm not saying whether or not I agree with the
rule, just noting the fact that it is a bannable offense.

Second, the one-character only rule on SZ and RZ is to squish twinking
as much as possible. These are intended to be more RP-oriented server,
and many people beleives it helps create a more RP-friendly atmosphere
if twinking is made more difficult.
