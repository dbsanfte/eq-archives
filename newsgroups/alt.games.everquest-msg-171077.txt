 Sean, 
          I had a similar problem recently, actually it was the exact
same problem, but it didn't effect any other games, just EQ. It
started right after the second patch after PoP came out. I had to
format my hdd, reload windows, loaded the latest drivers for all of my
equipment and it cleared it right up. EQ actually runs better now than
it ever has. I know thats probably not the solution you were hoping
for, but thats what worked for me. My video card is also a GForce
card, but it's a Gforce 4 TI4200 128 mb card. I think they've had some
problems the GForce cards lately. I checked the forums when my problem
was going on and everyone having a similar problem had a GForce card.
Hope this helps some. 

Jerry
