That appears to be a free account. They are for cheapos like me, or
those that wish to have an artificial penis.

Look for a paid account, which has the verified status. I think (could
be wrong, it's happened before) that they have to be updated by the
program, and can't be altered by the user.

I need to try it with EQEMU and see if it takes that data. Be
interesting to see a verified Magelo profile with all Guide gear... ;-)
