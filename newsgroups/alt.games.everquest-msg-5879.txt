That was Rammer

So it would seem Rammer is here because of Posts made by regulars here in
retaliation <sigh> for posts made by Gets, yourself and Sword and so it goes
on and will continue to do so, no matter how many times I or anyone else
says it, you cannot flame someone who is here just to get flamed, it is what
they wanted. It's blindingly obvious what you guys are doing, or at least it
is to me.

Oh well guess I was wrong and this'll be here for a while now.
