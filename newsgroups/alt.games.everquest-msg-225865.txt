Killing Deathfist orcs in East Commonlands does not work for the
Freeport Militia (the gate guards will KoS an ogre though the
Commonland guards will be dubious). I think that turning in 4 orc pawn
picks to a guard [Colin?] in the West Commonlands nets you positive
militia faction. Once you are dubious, you can take the Deathfist
Slashed Belts (mostly from orc centurions) to Capt. Hazran in Militia
building second floor balcony for better militia faction (bad Pally
faction but then you will be killing many more orcs so that should be
solvable).
