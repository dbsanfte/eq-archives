Paladin honestly didn't know what he was talking about. However, as
you mentioned in a later post, you're below level 10. If you're not
having mana troubles, you may as well get up and melee at that level.
(Me, I never group until at the very least my late teens...)

If you want to be able to easily find groups, don't go with the druid.
It's not that they're no good in groups, it's that most people don't
seem to know that they are useful. Pallies make good tanks, and are
always welcome in a group as far as I've seen. Clerics are very
well-recieved, too. Especially if you really know your class and play
it well, but that can be said for any class.
