It is. I ran some tests last night before I posted. Created a c:\temp
directory, ran EQ, the directory was gone. Created again, put a file
in it, ran EQ, folder stayed. I repeated the test several times. 

I'm pretty sure I haven't lost any files because of this, but as a
matter of principle, EQ should never mess with any files or
directories outside of its own folder.
