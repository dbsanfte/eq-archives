Too early to tell if you screwed up or not. I may have done the same thing
myself, depending on the circumstances.

It's an investment that (as is the nature of investments) may or may not pay
off. As long as you can afford it, why not take the chance. He may turn out
to be a fairy godfather, if you like that sort of thing.

Hope it works out, be sure to let everyone know. Maybe you should run a book
on it in the newsgroup.
