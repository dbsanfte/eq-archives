But, it's been steadly growing on my nerves.

USE / CHAR ALL.

For example, consider the following:

* GM * [20 Monk] Appie (Gnome)

vs / all:

* Apprenctice Guide * [20 Monk] Appie (Gnome)

*breathes*  Ok, I feel better.  Is it just a shortcut to assume any
green name is a GM, rather than a guide?  I see this so often.  People
assume a green name means they can help you right here, right now, when
all they can do is forward it for a GM to look over.

Sorry for sounding so pissed off; it's really a non-issue, I guess.
