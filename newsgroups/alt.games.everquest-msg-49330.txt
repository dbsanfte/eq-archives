However, there are also zones with XP modifiers.  They are not in any way
based on race.  Basically there are now two XP modifiers in the game, one is
race (Halflings level the fastest for example), and the other is zone.  They
are completely independant XP modifiers.  So, a zone that gives 20% more XP
will do so regardless of race.  A race that requires 20% more XP to level,
requires it regardless of zone.  IIRC, Everfrost is a good newbie zone, it
has a decent XP bonus, not certain about that though.
