I am on the west coast of USA and I haven't been able to log too
(roughly 3:00am ish). It's a slow "I'm trying but you can't log on"
different from the usual server down "you can't log on". It was
daylight savings here in  Southern California so I wonder if the logon
server's OS or hardware automatically changed the time at 2:00am and
it just didn't like that?
