Are the affected characters all in the same zone??

Had a similar problem recently zoning one of my chars into Qeynos.
Got booted to login and couldn't get back on that character.  Tried
reloading the zone files, etc etc etc . . . Even reloaded everything
from scratch but no luck.

Then finally a guide explained to me that every zone in EQ runs on a
different, totally random, port.  Every time a server is rebooted, the
ports are randomly generated again.  What had happened in my case was
that the last port picked for Qeynos happened to be one that my
internet provider had blocked, blocking me form entering that zone.  

To confirm this, I moved another one of my characters to that zone and
'poof' same thing.  The guide offered to get a gm to 'walk' my
characters out of that zone, but I found another remedy on my own.  I
went to my brothers house, who uses a different internet provider,
logged into my account and walked the affected characters to a
different zone.

I don't know that this is your problem but consider this possible
scenario:  

Servers go down for a patch, your char is camped in the current zone
he's in.

Servers reboot, reassigning the ports used, only this time, the port
picked for the zone you were in is blocked by your internet provider,
leaving all your characters in that zone 'bugged'  (imagine if this
zone happened to be PoK or Bazaar, eeeek)

I know it sounds like a long shot, but consider the possibility.  I
wouldn't have believed it if it hadn't happened to me.  I have been
playing for over 2 years and had never heard of this till about a
month ago when it happened to me.

Pass this info along to your friends

Good luck and Good hunting
