This is partially broken, though, in that nothing will equip to your ammo slot.
grab your arrows by hand and dump em on your character portrait.

Also, I've been having odd results with autoequipping dual weilded
weaponry; sometimes the item I loot first ends up in my secondary
slot.  Don't know how old this problem is, since I only just ran a melee
up to dual weild level since the autoequip patch for the first time a couple
days ago... but imagine my surprise at the message "you must have
a piercing weapon to use backstab"... as I try to poke the A Orc with
my gnoll hide lariat, bloodstained fang safely parked in my off hand
where it can do a pierce once every minute or so!
