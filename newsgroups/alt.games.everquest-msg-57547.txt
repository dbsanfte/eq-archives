  Hi,
      Im not sure that the "spirit of a guild war" makes any sense to me.
Sure I could have mounted a conventional assault.  But the idea of attacking
a large body of clerics(with full mana) and pallys  (with loh) does not sit
well.  I would have had to go into enemy held territory later to pull
bodies.  There is no real fast retreat from kaladim when draggin and rezzin.
War is war and their is no honor in war.  27 dead for them   zero for me.
The numbers speak for themselves   ty
