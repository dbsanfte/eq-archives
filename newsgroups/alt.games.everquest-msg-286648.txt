I see from your magelo that you've already discovered the armor quests
in Gorukar Mesa.  You still don't have the best pieces, the legs and
robe.  The legs are difficult, but mostly because of waiting for
Fantoma to finally spawn.  By contrast, people seem to always be
killing the bears, and it's easier to find the named bear for the
robe.  The named bear is a tough fight, particularly because of the
DoT proc.  My 55 druid had little trouble, since druid soloing is a
non-contact sport.

My 52 enchanter got creamed until I discovered a trick.  Remember
those charm spells?  No, don't charm the bear.  See those "agitated
skeletons" wandering around, right near Scout Madu?  Yep, level 51
skeletons wandering among mid-40's mobs.  What's great about these
skeletons is that, like spectres, they move naturally at snared
speed.  See where I'm going?  Yep, charm a skeleton, and it will mow
through any mob in that end of the zone.  The best part is, on a charm
break, you only have to run away from your target (which you've
hopefully rooted anyway).  The perma-snared skeleton gives you lots of
time to run away and safely re-charm, even if you've made it a hasted,
dual wielding buzzsaw of doom.  This makes charm soloing so easy, it
almost feels like cheating. :)  Oh, a hasted, dual wielding skeleton
should be able to take out Fantoma with minimal help (slow) and the
named bear (Ursulua?) with substantial help from you (slow, nukes,
rune, etc.).  Berserker Strength, a level 47 rune with no gem
component, is a beautiful thing for cheaply adding extra resilience to
your pet.

At this level, you should be able to get quite far on the Charm of
Lore quests out of Crescent Reach.  With enough pieces, this becomes
unquestionably better than the Kobold Skull charm.  At level 52,
you're right at the threshold of being able to get that many pieces
easily.  Also check out the Slipgear's Gem quests in DoDh.  You can
adopt a level 5 goblin rogue shroud and easily hit all of the
locations in 4 out of 5 zones (except the Hive) with no danger.  This
will give you +10 to all stats and some AC and HP (+15, if you can
finish the Hive part too; this is harder since a few mobs there see
invis, and there are some webs that strip invis/hide in the tunnels).
I recommend taking 2-3 SoW and levitation potions to make the run more
bearable.  I haven't yet run the TSS equivalent quests, so I don't
know how they compare.

Check out the armor quests in Blightfire Moors.  You can probably pick
up the patterns and needed drops for a song in either the Bazaar or
even buyback from area merchants!  In particular, look for the helm
pattern.  While the stats aren't anything special, the helm also has a
Wind instrument mod!  OK, it's not about how good the mod is, but that
it has one at all!  Several songs (invisibility, charm) simply won't
work without *some* kind of wind instrument, and this is the easiest
way I know of to get a Wind mod on your gear.  This lets you, say,
turn invisible without the hassle of swapping in a flute every time.
I believe other pieces also have other instrument mods, although I
don't recall specifics.  I make no pretense of being other than a
flaky, fair-weather bard, so you can discount this if avoiding
instrument swapping is too soft for you. :)

Your other low level characters will probably also appreciate the
Blightfire gear.  Lots of yummy effects abound (e.g. Spell Haste, Mana
Regen, etc.).  If you don't have better, do the quest from the
Crescent Reach blacksmith for the 75% WR bag.  There is a repeatable
quest in Blightfire to kill witchlamps (aka TSS willowisps) for a
modest clarity potion (5 mana/tick or so).

The classic advice for newbie bard instruments is to run to Katta
Castellum (on Luclin, not the newest expansion) and buy some Combine
instruments.  They're a bit pricier than the run-of-the-mill vendor
instruments (~100 plat, as I recall), but the mods are around 10%
better.  If you're patient, you can hunt some goblins in Warslik's
Wood for a Tambourine of Rituals.

Good luck!
