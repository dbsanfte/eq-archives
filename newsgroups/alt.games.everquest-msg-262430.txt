Sorry, this is incorrect.    While doing LDoN's a few weeks ago, we started
one dungeon with 5 people, only to have a friend log on as we were buffing
and ask to join.   We all left the original adventure, added him and got a
new one.   Nobody in the group received a failure message and nobody took a
loss.   It simply removed us with no text at all.

If you do not zone into the adventure, you do not take any kind of a loss.

I haven't tested it, but I'd be willing to bet this is not true as well.

If you zoned in with them, yes.
