At the time that it was in Sony's control, sure. The last time those
boxes were in Sony's control was the day they were printed.

Consider... some computer store decides to save shelf space. They put
all the EQ games into a box and stuff it in the storage room. Ten
years later they find the box, and stick all those EQ games on the
shelf.

Is Sony responsible for seeing to it that those games still run?
Hardly. It's the same situation as we're seeing right now, just with a
different time scale.


Now, if after a reasonable time (subject to normal business
constraints of the changes required) Sony is still printing boxes that
say Win95, then yes there might be some liability.

Yes, *the store*. Sony is not the store.

Here's a hint - people who toss around comments like that are rarely
received well, because they demonstrate that they don't have a clue
what they're talking about.
