Its true that 8 clots presents a challenge to the player as to which spells
to have memmed. Sometimes however (see my post about fm) you just need more.
period.
How much do you value the challenge of 8 spell slots vs how much do you
dislike having to click around in your spellbook memming new spells? For me
the challenge isnt much of a challenge... its *obvious* what spells i need
memmed. Sometimes you just have to remem spells. period. Boring licking
around in spellbook with mouse. Micromanagment. Blah. Not fun. Well thats
how I see it anyway, and Im sure so do many others.
