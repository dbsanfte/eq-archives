Well, if you want to add to the list:
The multiple hotmail accounts that posted that get-rich-quick spam
here recently have been terminated.  Of course, it's real easy to get another
hotmail account.

Also, the idiot that wanted to find a hack to someone's account has had
his account snipped and Verant was notified.  Not that they can do anything.
At least the account was wacked, though.
