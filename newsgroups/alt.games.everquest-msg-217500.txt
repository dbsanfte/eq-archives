On the Antonius Bayle server:

Happened to me and my friend last night in Plane of Hate where we were
duoing the magi-house.
Couldn't even gate out after our pets were molested.

Petitioned but it was past midnight and we both had to log.

Really pisses me off now that I have to waste another hate stone and ask
guildies to help me with a CR.
