The most obvious flaw is lack of healing.  The SK could lifetap, but that's
"limited" at best.  If you're planning to strictly be a duo, and not pick up
any groups, I don't think it would work out.  If, however, you are planning
to pick up groups, this would be a fine duo.  If you pick up a healer you'd
have the backbone of any good group:  tank, healer, enchanter.  Add a damage
dealer or three and you'd be set for non-stop kills :-)

If you really want to go with dark elves, you could start cleric and
enchanter.  I doubt there are many messages that say "Cleric and Enchanter
looking for more" that go unanswered for more than about 2 seconds.  Or,
again, if you don't want to pick up groups, warrior and cleric is probably
the way to go, since Dark Elven clerics can snare with an item effect.
