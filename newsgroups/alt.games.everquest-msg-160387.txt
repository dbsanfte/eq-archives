Make the switch.  XP is a thoudand times batter than me.  Either that or
drop back to 98se even it is more stable.  I can tell you that they just
came out with SP1 for XP.  After doing an initial install of XP on my new
rig (details at the end... and no you cant have my stuff) I down loaded all
the patches, then put in the latest drivers. (SP1 includes the lates DX8.?
version so don't get frustrated like i did looking for it) After all that is
done start puting in your aplications.  If you have POP but you antivirus in
last.  that way you have no problems with it interfearing.  Most of the
people that have complained about bad disk's( i know there where some) or
unstable performance had a problem during the instal of POP caused by the
AV.

If yo make the switch you will love it..  or hate it the interface is
diferent, but you can always go to clasic veiw.
