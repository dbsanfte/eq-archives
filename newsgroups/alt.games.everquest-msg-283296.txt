Take Two

note: Please someone write a better one than this!

Rogue

Traditional duty: melee damage.  Other roles: scout, puller, body
recovery, last ditch backup tank.  A poor solo class, rogues have
moderately good DPS from the front but extremely good DPS from the back,
they don't get enough AC, HP, or avoidance to really serve well as main
tanks, and even when (due to good gear and buffs) they  -can- serve in
that capacity, it involves sacrificing a healthy chunk of their DPS.
Value on raids is very high, as they have some of the highest
sustainable DPS in the game, and plenty of aggro avoidance to go with
it, and raids find a lot of value in their "other roles" abilities.

Rogues have no mana bar to worry about, basically functioning off of
timers and player skill; positioning and aggro management and so forth
are their main worries in a fight, outside the fight, they have the
ability to Hide and to Sneak (which other classes share) but also to do
both at the same time, making them able to move while hidden, invisible
in a way no other class can be, to both live and undead mobs.  At high
levels, this ability becomes astonishing, allowing them to literally
walk past (nearly?) any mob in the game.  At low levels, this
combination forces them to move very slowly, but with SOW or the proper
AAs at higher levels, they can end up moving fast enough to make very
good use of this ability.

Rogues don't solo well, classically, with good gear and buffs they can
do so to some extent, but since by and large this means sacrificing a
big portion of their main claim to fame, DPS, this tends to be reserved
for cherry picking lower level named mobs.

The key function of the rogue is their "backstab" ability; available on
a timer, this functions as an extra attack and does damage as a multiple
of the damage stat of their weapon.  This is radically different than
the similar Berserker abilities such as Flurry, which do a fixed amount
of damage unrelated to gear, and is the key to producing extremely high
DPS; rogue is very dependant on their choice of weapon.  The rogue must
be behind the mob when hitting Backstab to do this damage, if she's not,
she'll still get an extra attack, but only at normal damage for the
weapon.  Backstab is also a major Aggro producer, which means that
timing is critical; the rogue must be able to dump aggro to someone else
in order to get that backstab in in the first place, and then must be
able to lose aggro afterwards (or not get it in the first place despite
the backstab).

This brings us to Evade.  Not technically a seperate skill, its another
"rogue only" use of the existing Hide skill; in combat, a successful
Evade (success being predicated on your hide skill) will allow you to
temporarily drop aggro down to the lowest possible level (but not entirely,
thats Feign Death.  To do this, you must turn off attack, then hide, and
hope for the best.  This ability is on a timer of roughly the same length
as the Backstab one, and can be used one of two ways; either evade, then
backstab, then go back to fighting, if you are functioning as "main tank"
(this means the mob is beating on you, but turns away to your companion
for just a blow or two, long enough for you to stab him in the back) or
if your MT has aggro, backstab then immediately Evade if your backstab
got the mob's attention. (a good MT will be able to gain aggro again
fairly shortly since you aren't doing any more damage till you go back
into attack mode).  Or even better, don't evade at all, a really good MT
can hold aggro despite your annoying backstabbing behavior!

Due to evade, it is possible for a rogue to serve as Main Tank on fairly
easy mobs, or early in the game where mobs simply aren't that hard. They
still tend to avoid soloing, because they need someone to stand next to
the mob when they evade; the mob will only turn their back on them if
there's someone else standing there on the hate list to attack instead.
At high levels, some rogues have claimed good results working with feats
which allow them to backstab even from the front... but few say this is
better for them than grouping with just about any other class.

One other thing needs to be said about rogues.  They also have the
ability to Pickpocket mobs, taking with each successful attempt a
portion of the cash loot the mob was carrying.  This is undetectable...
and extremely unfortunate, since it means many groups refuse to take
rogues, fearing that they'll end up taking far more than their share of
the loot.  At high levels, this doesn't matter much, since the actual
cash mobs carry tends to cap out and become unimportant.  At any level,
though, the obvious solution is to allow the rogue to be "master
looter", the person responsible for looting all the bodies and then
sharing out the loot with everyone.  Since this means it doesn't matter
whether the cash was found on the bodies before or after they die, that
pretty much takes care of the issue, you HAVE to trust your master
looter anyway.  Since their pickpocket skills are actually required as a
step of their epic, allowing them the opportunity to practice in this
way is a good idea.

=======================================================
Bah, only said Berserker one time when I meant rogue, and one time (the 
title) in addition to rogue.  And as far as I can see, despite refusing 
to utilize a spell checker, I didn't write rouge once, what a disgrace.

I went in and updated a couple details I thought weren't clear, while I 
was at it, I think this is pretty accurate to the limits of my knowlege 
of the class; I also think its very long, easily twice as long as my 
Berserker writeup!  If I was a newspaper editor tight on space, I'd drop 
the whole Pickpocket part, and probably the "rogues don't solo well" 
section to boot.
