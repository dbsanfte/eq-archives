? Since when does he drop the totem of warrior spirit?

Its just luck as far as grachnist. My troll sk level 35 (so really can
barely kill) got him to spawn in about an hour and got the earring
on that first one. Later my druid came back and killed him like 3
times got no earring. Its all just random very low chances, for him to
spawn and REALLY for him to have the earring.
