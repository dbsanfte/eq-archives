Yes, root the mob with a short root ( make sure your group knows what you 
are doing and understands how root proximity-aggro works ), then step up 
into the mob's face and let it hit you once.  You pet will attack it at 
that point.  Keeping  berserker spirit ( or a lesser spell in that line ) 
on you should keep the healers from having to heal you.  Or, if you have 
Illusion: Iksar or Troll, use those to regen the HPs back that you lose 
from the hit you take.

I think if YOU attack a monster that has a damage shield on it, the hate 
will now make your pet attack the monster just because the DS damaged, or 
tried to damage you.  No guarantees on this, but I will probably test it 
out soon.
