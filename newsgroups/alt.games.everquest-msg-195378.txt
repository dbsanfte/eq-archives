Over the eliminaton of the single largest crutch known to Norrath?! If the 
game is so terrible without it, why would you play in the first place? 
Personally, I don't care if people get KEI or not. I enjoy it myself from 
time to time, rarely going out of my way for it. However, to consider it a 
necessity to even enjoy the game is just plain lunacy.

A tsi tsi fly just called. They want their attention span back.

Maybe we could put medding back in where you have to stare at the spellbook
again.  That would sure be a great test of my tsi tsi fly attentions span.  You
asked why I would play if the game was so bad without kei?  Answer is that I
didn't.  I quit the game because although I thought it had great potential, I
didn't want to sit on my ass and stare at a spellbook all the time.   Somehow I
don't find that entertaining. A friend told me that the game had improved and I
came back to give it a try.  I think it has improved immensely, I frankly don't
care if they raise the requirements to level or make the mobs tougher, I just
don't want to sit around doing nothing.  That's boring.
