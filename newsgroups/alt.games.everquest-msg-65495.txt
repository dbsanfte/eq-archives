Hmm, not sure what you mean. And never been to Muire's Tomb. So far I 
did think that training in DAOC is impossible. You can bring an aggro 
mob to a group, but it won't aggro on them until they either damage the 
mob or heal you. After the mob is done with you, it will go back to the 
place you picked it up
