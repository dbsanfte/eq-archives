Based on the information currently available, I'd say you are out of
luck. :(

<snip theory that there would be a shared bank slot between EQ and EQ2>

I'm afraid I have to burst your bubble here as well. :(

Moorguard on www.eqlounge.com:

"You won't be passing down items from your EQ character. Besides the fact
that our item databases are completely different, we don't want to give
anything to players that would unbalance the game. 

What you get will just be a neat link to the time you spent in EQ. It
won't make you a more powerful characer in EQ2, or affect how fast you
level. 

It's about flavor and immersion, and a fun way to connect the two games."
