Speed weights things in favour of faster weapons but thats all
it does; the weighting becomes more and more dramatic the higher you
level, but its still just a weighting of the core assessment; weapon
damage ratio.

I mean, you'd not suggest someone use a 9/18 weapon over a 24/22 one
simply because 9/18 was quicker would you? ;)

So, given that, the decision comes down to this:

Is the damage gained by the mainhand speed bonus enough to offset that
*lost* by putting the better ratio weapon in the offhand?
