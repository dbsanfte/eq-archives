Jesus are you slow or something? Slapfish just got through explaining
to the first guy who couldn't figure out he what Tim was asking, and
you come along and post the exact same thing the mixed up guy said!

Read for comprehension. The original poster isn't asking where to hunt
for plat. He is asking about proportionally how much plat in the
economy comes from mobs, from selling loot, etc.
