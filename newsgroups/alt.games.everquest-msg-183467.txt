First some background.....

The guild I am in is a lot of fun, nice family atmosphere, and
free-spirited.  But when it comes to some of the tougher raid targets is
filled with a bunch of people that have no clue what they are doing.  We can
handle Kael rather easily (not sure about any of the cycles though) but
after a trip to Plane of Hate (in which I eventually gated out in fear of
where it was all going) I realized that we were in trouble unless some
edumacation went on.  So after talking to the officers (and later becoming
an officer) we came up with the plan of doing Kael and working our way up,
but only taking people up the scale as they learned from previous
encounters.  So we threw together an idea of a point system.  Attend a raid,
get points.  Have points, go on higher level raids, etc.

So now my question is, what suggestions would you have for this plan?  Right
now it is merely an idea and not fully flushed out so any ideas would be
greatly appreciated.

We have no plans of being the next Uber-Guild on the server or seeing places
like Vex Thal, etc.  But I would like us to be able to handle most epic
encounters and such, so I need ideas on how to go about training them.

What I would like help with:

1. Some idea of a point system that has worked for other guilds.
2. A tier of raid targets for the guild to work its way up.
3. Suggestions of how to approach the entire idea with the guild en masse
without destroying the "free-spirited" approach that seems to work for this
group of people.

Thanks in advance for any advice or suggestions.
