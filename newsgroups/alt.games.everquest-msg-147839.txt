Can anyone clue me into the market for these in the bazaar?  Varies by
server, of course, but I want to know if they generally sell
immediately or if they take some time to find a buyer.  Is the demand
for them really high?

I'm thinking with a 49 wiz, it takes about 20 minutes of quadding to
make up for an unrezzed death.  As long as they sell fast, one could
make a decent amount of cash and make up for lost exp in a short time
span.
