With respect, that may be that you dont understand what is being described.

The mob will run to the group and hit the first person it comes across.

The scout just has to stand behind the warrior.

Proximity aggro will do the rest. There is no 'running together'
involved, and, unless you're in a dungeon with twisty turny bits,
the scout doesnt have to leave the party at all. Stalk has an amazing
range.

Should the scout have to leave the camp my experience suggests he'd
simply hit stalk, run back to the camp, and stand with the warrior
between himself and the npc in question - it will happily pound away
on the first group member it reaches.

That is because the mage gets aggro. In this case, as far as I can see,
the scout doesn't. I can stand behind a party member, hit stalk and 
with them doing *nothing but standing there* the mobs will hit them instead,
as they reach them first.

Perhaps I've just had amazing circumstances, I've only used stalk to
pull 4 or 5 times, but thats how its worked for me so far.
