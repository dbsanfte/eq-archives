Was a joke, of course. Honestly, I already tag most of my EQ2 posts as
such, and will likely start tagging EQ1 posts as well. 

As far as it not being the EQ2 group goes, wouldn't that be like saying
the Star Wars group isn't the Star Wars: Return of the Jedi group? To me
this seems like a pretty appropriate place for both EQ 1 and 2
discussion. Kind of like the fact that there is only one
a.g.final-fantasy.rpg group, but some 10 or so versions. 

I agree that tagging would be hugely beneficial though.
