Agent: Robbins has bipolar disorder
RAIDERS CENTER SORRY FOR ACTIONS, STATEMENT SAYS
By John Ryan
Mercury News

Raiders center Barret Robbins has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, his
agent wrote in a prepared statement Monday.

In a release posted on ESPN.com, Drew Pittman said Robbins, 29, is
hospitalized for treatment and his NFL future is ``uncertain.'' The
condition -- commonly called manic depression -- is often accompanied by the
use of alcohol or drugs.

``In Barret's case, alcohol was involved,'' said the release, which was
crafted by Pittman and Marisa Robbins, Barret's wife.

It's the first public acknowledgment by anyone connected with Robbins that
the All-Pro center was on a drinking binge while skipping practice and
meetings Jan. 25, the day before the Raiders lost 48-21 to the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers in the Super Bowl in San Diego.

The release didn't confirm the widely circulated theory that Robbins spent
much of that Saturday in Tijuana, Mexico. As early as the day after the
Super Bowl, self-proclaimed witnesses were trying to sell evidence of
Robbins' whereabouts for sums reaching six figures.

Pittman's statement intimated that Robbins has been confronted with payment
demands to keep embarrassing moments from becoming public knowledge.

``The details of his behavior are not completely verifiable, as even Barret
does not have a full recollection,'' the statement read. ``Individuals who
participated with him and did nothing to help his situation are trying to
profit from Barret's misfortune. To pay these individuals for their secrecy
is in direct conflict with Barret's desire to be fully accountable for his
actions. These matters have been turned over to legal authorities.''

The statement expressed ``remorse and deep sadness'' to Robbins' family,
teammates, the organization and fans. After the game, many teammates -- most
notably guards Frank Middleton and Mo Collins -- blasted Robbins for
skipping out on the team. Both players said they wouldn't welcome him back
as a teammate.

As talk in the ensuing week focused on Robbins' emotional instability,
Middleton and Collins were criticized in many circles. Marisa Robbins told
the Contra Costa Times last week, ``I was so furious at how quick they were
to jump on, `Oh, he was just partying.' That showed a total lack of
compassion.''

Monday night, Middleton said that although he would reassess his feelings
after meeting with Barret Robbins, he doesn't regret his comments.

``At the time, nobody knew anything about anything,'' Middleton said. ``The
way it looked to us was he just didn't show up. . . . I've known the guy for
two years, and nobody told us anything about anything. All of a sudden he's
manic depressive because he goes missing.''

He added, ``When it happened, everybody had the same things to say -- `he
let the team down, everybody's disappointed.' Everybody said the same thing
at the time. Everybody felt the same way. Some people still feel the same
way.''

As to whether they could be teammates again, Middleton said, ``I would have
to talk to the guy. It would be between me and him. When the time comes, I'd
have to face him and he'd have to face me.''

Raiders senior assistant Bruce Allen said he addressed the matter with
several players last week in Hawaii, where most of the offense attended the
Pro Bowl while quarterback Rich Gannon, right tackle Lincoln Kennedy and
receiver Jerry Rice played. ``We've had some discussions, but we'll leave it
at that,'' Allen said.

It was supposed to be Robbins' first appearance in the all-star game in his
eight-year career. Instead, all questions about his career have taken a back
seat to his health.

``The Raiders have not made any decisions regarding his employment,'' the
statement read, ``as they, too, are more concerned with his well-being.''
