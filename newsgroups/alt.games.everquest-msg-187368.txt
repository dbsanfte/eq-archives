Bullshit as usual. I knew it was something added on to zones to make
kills in them be worth higher experience. I didn't know the formula.
Because I didn't know the formula seeing a non-zero number made me
jump to the wrong conclusion that a zone which doesn't raise exp on
regular mobs actually does.

Is this what you're trying to spin now? Have we already forgotten your
initial attack was that you said I was claiming people who knew the
numbers had no lives?

Your attempts to prove I didn't know what a ZEM was have failed
utterly. Not only that, but google shows proof that I was aware of
them at least a year ago.

You're so full of shit you make the Augean stables look clean. Just
admit that YOU were the one who read something into a phrase that just
wasn't there, and that your comments afterwards were uncalled for. Go
ahead, admit you were wrong, and the whole thing will be dropped. You
don't have anything left to add anyways, everything you've tried has
been explained.
