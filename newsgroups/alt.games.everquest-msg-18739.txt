In some zones you can sell Jade for a bit.  It is used for some common
+mana, +hp, +ac items, but is not sold in or near Freeport.  I don't
remember the vendor price off hand, but think it is about 4pp.  You might
get someone to pay up to twice that to save them a trip to elsewhere to get
it.  So top price of 8pp for jade, and that only if you are lucky and find
someone that needs Jade to make something and needs it now.  I just shoved 4
jade in the bank in case I needed some in Freeport.

The stones that are only drops are the ones that can sell for a good amount.
Diamond, Blue Diamond, Black Pearl, and some others.  These come off high
level mobs.  I think the lowest is the Black Pearl which comes off of around
L20 mobs.  Some of these are also needed for quests, which makes their price
go into the KPP.

The ones that drop, but are NOT only drops, and would cost 60pp or more, are
the Sapphire, Fire Emerald, Ruby, and a couple others.  These tend to go for
less than what a merchant would sell them for, but more than what a merchant
would buy them for.  This is also conditional on you finding a buyer.  Many
jewelers do not want to stock up on these things.
