You must have long butt fights. At level 38 my sk has nearly that same
dex and would be lucky to see even one proc during a fight. I stopped
using it. I don't think I'll use it until I get one of the items which
has right clickable vampire embrace on it, since its not worth the
bother to take up a spell slot even otherwise.

Seems more worth it to me past 30 to chain cast the lifetap sometimes,
course 30 is the first good one since its 45 hp. Even with my
swirlspine belt and MOSS, with an enchanter level appropriate haste to
boot, I'd only proc it once or twice during a longer group fight.
