You claim to have known from the beginning the problems and issues. If you
want to simply ignore them and try and squeeze some entertainment from it,
that's your choice. Everyone knows, regardless of the catalyst, you finally
came to your senses.

I don't recall any billion dollar class actions, but then let's just chalk
that up to your predictable over exaggeration of things, or under
exaggeration of things, depending on how your personal wind blows.

Never recommended bomb shelters, but gas masks of reasonable quality are
something I advocate. Once again you stoop to trying to insult and paint me
rather than simply discussing he points. What's wrong Bob, can't make a
meaningful post without tearing the other guy down?

I haven't apologized for anything other than telling Bryan I apologize for
acting a little emotional in responses to him. Other than that, I am here
and standing by my post and responding to you in a civil manner. As far as
names and slinging insult, you obviously entered the thread with that in
mind. Anyone can easily go and see this for fact. My only goal is to impress
upon people I have been talking to through this forum for 5 years that they
are needing to take a long and hard look at reality.

I see so since I have a family and have made money, you admit to have a
prejudice towards me? Kind of sad but I understand. I am sorry you aren't
making any money Bob. Not my fault but you can blame me if it makes you feel
better...

I have a very good social life, but thank you for the consideration. Maybe
Bob, you need to stop trying to tear down people to further your arguments?

Fair enough. I find it a repetitive fact that anytime I post something you
disagree with, you go through several steps of subtle flames, then to direct
attacks, then finally labeling the other guy as "hopeless". Maybe Bob, when
you attack me, you are simply using facts about your own life. If you need a
friend Bob, try not attacking them the moment you disagree with them.
