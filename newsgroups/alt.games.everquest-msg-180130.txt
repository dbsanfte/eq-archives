It wasn't my SS so I can't say for sure...  recruits wasn't likely the
explanation.

Bats are on the way to Akheva though (those little building things), and did
you know those coh thingies (third building from DSP to Akheva) flurry!

Anyway, hell if i know where the train came from.. all I can say is we have
some really dumbass members, and some very weird people, and between them,
you have mass fucking trains in zones like ME.

Also some people like playing the "lets see who can make the biggest train
game"...

We were in SSeru yesterday for Seru, I pulled 3-4 mobs at a time (some of
that shit flurrys and its all miscons... I was "training" but nothing that
was realy devestating.

Well anyway a cleric went exploring or something, I was looking for stuff to
"train" when I saw him, and omfg thats what you call a train!  He ran about
15 mobs back to the raid (we'd been there a while, so lots of ppl were afk),
that was pretty special.

He killed about 9 people within the first 20 seconds haha (mainly healers
who'd toss a heal at the start, not seeing the other 14 untanked mobs).. he
even pulled the gd paladin trainer (or so I was told) - anyway paladin GM
trainer dude = down !

Basically bored people = lets do something retarded, like train ourselves
with ridiculous over pulls
