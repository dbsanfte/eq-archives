You're cutting yourself off from many fine weapon choices, that are
extremely effective, including some of the very best warrior weapons in the
game. (/drool Hategiver.  /drool Willsapper)   I take it you already knew
that though.

As long as you're smart about it, yes, you can keep using 1HS and 2HS
throughout your entire career.   It'll probably be harder to acquire
weapons, but not impossible.   The Jagged Blade of War, the warrior epic
weapon, is a one hand slash (and 2 hand slash) that has enough hate on it
that if you can get it, you'll always have something that is "good enough"
to let you hold aggro.  Be warned though, it's one of the worst epic quests
there is.
