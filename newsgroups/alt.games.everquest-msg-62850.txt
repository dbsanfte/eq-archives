What I find annoying about the patcher is that it seems slower than
the old, bare bones patcher when it comes to checking my files, and
that it litters my eq folder with extra log files.

Oh, and that I spent 20 minutes getting it last night while it kept
messing up on me and insisting it was already running and therefore
had to patch _verQuest.exe at least three times.
