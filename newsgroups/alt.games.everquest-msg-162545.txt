	E'ci does not have much in the way of munchkin guilds.  We have two
serious contenders (Reconstructed and Vane, the latter of which is Asian; both
are in Vex Thal and probably past Valor by now), one wannabe (Arete; they
can't kill anything you can't zerg), and "Some Alliance" (Forlorn/Sacrament of
Chaos/Last Hope, which I haven't heard much from these days.)  The next most
powerful group is the aforementioned public raiding bunch, lead by an
Enchanter named Ashorty (the channel we hang in is also called "ashorty", if
you want to eavesdrop), which has cleared everything in NToV except Vyemm.  (I
wasn't able to attend the NToV raids myself and they haven't been repeated
since PoP came out.)  The public also can't kill anything that can't be killed
by weight of numbers; there are some good players in there but by and large
the majority lacks discipline.  My guild (Arbiters) is one of the oldest and
largest on the server, but we're a social guild and we don't have the
organization for serious raiding.  Our best players have epics and HoT armor,
meaning they are underequipped by today's standards, and that's not likely to
change in the foreseeable future.

	In any case, I've never seen anyone from those guilds LFG anywhere, modulo
a handful of Arete people back when I was in Sebilis.  Certainly not at
trials.
