Your pet is not a tank.

Haste yourself and your pet.

Pull with slow / mailase line, then sic pet.

Pet should get aggro.

Cast you long lasting disease dot, and short lasting poison dot on the mob,
you will now get aggro.

Melee, reapply poison dot, /point then /laugh as the pitiful mob dies in
front of you.

Try and keep your pet behind the mob when you do this.
