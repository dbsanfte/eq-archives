Beneficial in east freeport sewers as a wood elf druid, to go from
threatening to glower dubious. Then you can raise faction to allied
via bone chips and later fire beetle eyes ;)

I did this one night while bored. Once to the fire beetle eye point, I
bound near xelha then ported to misty to a vendor who seemed to have
nearly unlimited beetle eyes (was a while after a patch) Then
gated/ported back and forth raising faction until bored.

FYI, you are still kos to opal dark briar evil after getting allied to
dismal rage when not in wolf form (at least I was.. though I no longer
was in wolf form when done) I was also still kos to the innoruuk
cleric dark elf near opal (thought not while in wolf form) since that
faction can't be raised.

Of course there is really no reason to do this other then to be able
to check the vendors near xelha and make evil characters do kind of a
double take .. "how wood elf druid here??!?!"

The main old world area its ver nice in is Unrest. You can leisurely
pull in unrest or camp since you are indiff in wolf to all the undead.

Since many old world areas were changed so its kos now, like halas,
its best to always get to a safe enough place away from the npcs and
use it while conning one. Depending on the area it could improve or
worsen your faction.
