June 27th, 3:00 am
------------------------------


** Gameplay Changes **

- Aggro Changes:  We've made an adjustment to the way that NPCs choose their
targets.  It's a rather simple change, one that makes a lot of sense.  But
we want you to be aware of it so that it won't surprise you too much, and so
that you won't think that it is a bug.  NPCs are now much more aware of the
vulnerability (or, more precisely, the invulnerability) of their targets.
NPCs will now be very unlikely to waste their time attacking a target that
they can't harm.

- Spell and Item Interruption:  Ducking will now interrupt a spell
instantly.  You will no longer be able to sit while using items or casting
spells.  This will not affect bard songs, which will still work as they
always have, but will affect all items, even those with song-like effects.


** Spell Changes **

- Skin Like Nature and Natureskin should stack with more spells now (though
not with each other).

- Aegolism can now be clicked off.

- Imbue Ivory has had its casting level lowered to 29.

- Shard of the Core will be tradable now.

- Shroud of Hate and Visions of Grandeur should stack properly now.

- Several new Translocation spells have been added.

- Call of the Hero will no longer remove the target from NPCs' hatelists if
the target is not summoned far enough.

- Egress will now work indoors.

- Wind of the North, Wind of the South, Markar's Relocation and Tishan's
Relocation have had their additional restrictions removed, and can now be
cast from any zone where other similar spells can be cast.

- Summon Companion can now be used by Necromancers, Shamans, Enchanters,
Shadowknights in addition to Magicians.

- Deadeye should now stack with Dead Man Floating, but should not stack with
Acumen.

- Plainsight will now stack with Dead Man Floating, but not with Acumen.

- The Great Divide portal spells are now 39th level instead of 44th level.

- Spirit of the Oak will no longer be overwritten by any beneficial spells.

- Paralyzing Poison spells should no longer be broken by direct damage
spells.

- Hsagra's Wrath and Porlos' Fury now have a 5 second recast delay.


** Melee Changes **

- Rogues will continue to face three different check for a successful
Instill Doubt (skill, kick, resist), regardless of the fact that rogues
never get a Kick skill and, therefore, at maxed ID skill will only succeed
about 15% of the time compared to a monk's 50%.


** Item Changes **

- The effect on the 10th ring should have fewer stacking conflicts with
haste buffs.

- The effect of the Monk epic, Celestial Tranquility, will stack with the
higher end haste spells. Keep in mind - the highest haste will always win
out.  This means that the spells will stack, the haste components will not.

- Speed of the Shissar has had its duration increased from 20 minutes to 30
minutes.  This effect should no longer conflict with Call of Earth.

- Bone Ring of Condemnation will no longer be usable in the secondary slot,
it will only be wearable on the finger.

- Druid Skyshrine Quest armor has had a color change so that it will look
more unique.

- Circlet of Shadow will no longer drop in-game.  The Circlet of Shadows,
can now be found in its place.  This item differs from the original only in
that it has a five-second casting time.  Existing Circlets of Shadow will
retain the same functionality as before, though we may change existing
Circlets at some future date.


** Quest Changes **

- King Tormax is now a little more particular about who he gives quests to.

- The Iksar Shaman 6th Skull/cudgel quest should be working now.

- Rumor has it that there is a new source for green dragon scales in
Norrath.


** PvP Changes **

- If you go link dead on a PvP server and are killed you can still be
looted.

- When a player becomes invisible (or hides successfully) every other player
that had them targeted will lose their target.  This is true for all
servers, but has the greatest implications on PvP servers.  The use of
spells that allow you to see through invisibility will prevent you from
losing your target if that target hides or goes invisible.

- Faction hits on Rallos Zek:  Killing a person in one of his or her home
cities will cause a faction hit with residents of that city.


** Miscellaneous **

- We've addressed a lot of spelling and grammatical errors over the past few
weeks.  For example we have corrected all misspellings of "deity" in
messages to the player, changed Cantana to Cantata and others.

- The 'Fab Four' in Dagnor's Cauldron will no longer assist Undertow
Skeletons.

- Instill Doubt/Intimidation can no longer be used while sitting, and
sitting after starting it will cancel it.

- Mastery of language skills now occurs at 100, not at 101.  This was a
problem for masters of a language, since language skills could not go over
100.

- The messages for eating and drinking now say "Chomp... Chomp," or "Glug...
Glug..." so that they can't be copied with emotes.

- Helms on Barbarians, Trolls, and Ogres should no longer block the first
person view when in combat.

- Sirens Grotto has been changed a bit.  It should be a more interesting
zone now.


** NOTE **

Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the
arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers.  Citizens rush to
get a copy of these publications to read the featured articles, latest
gossip, and community news for their home town.
