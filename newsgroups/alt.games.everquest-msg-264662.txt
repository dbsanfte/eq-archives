Anyone have any info on what the deal between Sony and FilePlanet was?  How 
much did FP pay Sony for those slots, if they did? I'm guessing FP will be 
giving favorable reviews to any Sony product , good or not.
How many people signed up for a FP account for a shot at Beta and didn't get 
a key? How many of those people signed up for "founders club", strictly for 
a chance at beta?
Flame me if you must, I'm not jealous, I just feel it was a tacky way to 
choose beta players.
