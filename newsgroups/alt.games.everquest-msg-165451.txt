In the example 1000, -2000, 30000, the first number is your
north/south position. The farther north you go, the higher this number
gets, the further south, the lower.   The second number is east/west,
the farther west the greater the number, east, the lower. The numbers
can be positive or negative depending on which side of the '0' line
you are on.   I believe the third number is elevation, but never paid
any attention to it.   These number will make alot of sense to you if
you go to eqatlas.com and printout a map of the zone you are in.  The
numbers on the right side of the map are your N/S positions, across
the top are E/W.  As someone else suggest, it's good to have a LOC key
you can either press in a hurry, or have it selected automatically, so
it can be activated just prior to getting you butt kicked.this way you
have coordinates to use in locating your corpse....which will be
necesssary after level 10 if you wish to reclaim your belongings.
