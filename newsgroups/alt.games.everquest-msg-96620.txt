I have just escaped my latest hell level of 35 and am discovering
that... well... my AC is crap. I am still wearing a load of Blackened
Alloy that was pretty mediocre 10 levels ago.

So... I decided to start questing for DF in the new Feerot.  I had a 
39 ranger and a 40 druid there to smooth things out, but we saw only 1 
crusader (being killed by someone else I might add) in 2-3 hours of play.
We were killing leezards constantly, keeping 2 of the temples cleared.
My question is- 1) Is there a certain place that might spawn the crusaders 
more often in Feerot?  2) Was the drop rate this slow in the old CT?

I don't mind doing the quests, but if it is truly going to take 3+ hrs per
piece of decaying armor I may need to reconsider my dreams of questing for
a full suit.

TIA
