What is "it"?  Oh, wait...I can skip down, read the post that you quoted in
its entirety to find what part you are referring to, and then jump back
here...OK, now I see what you are referring to.

If you are posting to communicate with people, rather than as just some kind
of literary masturbation, then organizing your post so as to be most
convenient to the reader (e.g., bottom-posting) makes a lot more sense than
organizing it for the convenience of the writer (top-posting).

It always amazes me that newbies can come along and assume that conventions
that have been nearly universal on usenet for well over 20 years are wrong.
