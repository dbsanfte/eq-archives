Everything is easier in WoW.  Contrast and compare two  broadly
comparable classes the Beastlord in EQ and the Hunter in WoW.

In WoW with gear that I looted off mobs and random cheap AH items I
can tear through endless mobs including Elites often up to 3 or 4 at a
time with only the odd death to show for it which in WoW is painless
enough to shrug off.  Add a second player of almost any class and
virtually every quest is possible.  Even solo most quests can be
knocked out no problem for often ludicrous amounts of extra
experience.

In EQ with expensive gear from the latest expansion right near the
best that can be obtained from the bazaar I can be killed in melee by
a single (slowed)  mob multiple levels below me.  If I back off and
let my buffed pet tank while I frantically heal it and  then myself I
can resume meleeing but it's risky and time consuming.

In WoW family guilds (super casual players, young kids and the like)
can do older raid content and win.  My old guild do this.  Even many
expansions old EQ content like Tacvi is too unforgiving for you to be
able to do similar things in EQ hence the WoW-esque introduction of
better quality bazaar gear with the last expansion.

I'm sure WoW raiding at the very bleeding edge is much like EQ was a
couple of expansions ago but a good chunk of EQ raid content remains
untouched (it's almost certainly not tuned but that's another thread.)
