I have several other hobbies. Most of them cost waaaay more than EQ does.
the $80 is just for TV, the internet connection is for a little more than EQ. I was
pointing out that $40 a month is nothing for hobby/entertainment, yet many people
in this ng think that its some outrageous sum or something. Before EQ I used to
spend that much on other single shot computer games. So EQ has actually saved
me money in that regard. =)
