OK, the latest on horses from an interview with Abashi at Castersrealm
(eq.castersrealm.com) - They will cost between 8,000 and 100,000pp,
depending upon the looks and speed.  The fastest horse will rival the
fastest bard speed song.

Vah Shir are getting Ultravision?, Safe Fall, high AGI & STR as race
abilities/stats, but their food consumption rate will also be high.

Beastlords are available to all Shaman races - and are described as a
Warrior/Shaman hybrid.  They can wear up to leather armor.

Oh, and ports to the Nexus are at 15 minute intervals for those who have
purchased tickets at Wizard platforms.
