I originally approached smithing with the same goal, making myself banded
armor.  I followed the guide on how to raise smithing in the cheapest way,
up to around 135 before I made my banded armor.  I did the train, metal
bits, scalers, lantern, skewers, pots, sewing kits route.  At 75 I think you
will experience too many failures to make it worthwhile to make the harder
banded items.  It was quite some time ago that I did this, and as I recall,
it still ended up costing me a few hundred plat to make my first set of
banded armor.  I did make some of that money back by making banded for a few
other players, but not too many people are interested in it anymore.  Since
then I went on to 175 with banded, and made myself some imbued northman
ringmail for my few spots that did not have +wis armor.
