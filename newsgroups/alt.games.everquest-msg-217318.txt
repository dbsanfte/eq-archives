From my experience in being guilded - as a follower, a raid leader, and an
officer:

Guildmembers, of any guild, tend to fall into two categories - followers and
leaders.

5% of the guild needs to be leaders.  These are the folks who take charge,
made decisions, and get the ball rolling.  They're your raid leaders, your
pullers, your lead clerics.  No guild can survive without them, and they
typically know their classes very well, and have very good ideas about how
several other classes work - a lead cleric setting up a CH chain must know
the limitations of druid and shaman CH, the raid leader must know the
effects of various bardsongs, and know where to put the bards for maximum
effect, etc.

95% of the guildmembers need to be followers - and too many leaders is BAD.
The leaders set their strategy based on how many of what class they have,
and issue orders based on their strategy.  A free-thinking follower who
doesn't follow orders - one who thinks he knows more about his class than
the leader does (and he's probably right) and does things HIS way instead of
the raid leader's way - will often wipe a raid.  (Yes, Mr. Ranger, I know
arrows are low-aggro.  Did you know if you get a lucky arrow crit, you can
put the AoW into summoning mode before he's in position and the MT has
aggro?  Whups, got summoned didn't you!  And there go the healers....)

The truly high-end guilds might be different, I'm not in an elemental guild
and probably never will be.  But at the working-on-elementals stage, them's
the facts as I see 'em.  And if you spend enough time doing exactly what the
raid leaders tell you to, you'll earn your DKP and get your uberloot when
it's your turn.  Sadly, this means many uberguild members learn not to turn
on autoattack before they're told, to keep behind the mob, to wait until
told to nuke - and not much more.

Does this mean that uberguilders suck?  Of course not.  It means that if
someone is already disposed to be a lazy player, they can get by just fine
being a lazy player so long as they can follow basic orders.  Do I group
with uberguilders?  Sure - but I pay attention to how they play, and if
they're the "autoattack and go get a beer" types they won't be invited to a
second group.  Oddly, most of my uberguild friends are lead clerics, lead
chanters, raid leaders, pullers.... go figure.

Rhian,
