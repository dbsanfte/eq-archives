Some player sold that to the merchant, they are not normally sold in Halas,
or anywhere else that I know of.  You may be able to find a player that
happens to have one, who will sell any of a number of Velium weapons for
around 10pp (not too likely).  How much money do you have to spend?  You can
purchase a combine weapon from the gypsies in the Oasis of Marr (long way to
travel from where you are) for 70ishpp, not a great weapon, but it is magic.
You could go for a piercer from a quest in Halas, again, not a great weapon,
but it is magic.  Look up the gnoll fur quest for that one.

If the spells are poison/disease related, then you purchase them from a
vendor on the temple ruins at the north wall of Everfrost out on the tundra,
before hitting the river.

If they are vision related, then get someone to buy them for you at the
magic users guild in Qeynos, unless you have done a lot of faction work.  Or
you can go get them from the gypsies in Oasis of Marr.  (same place,
different gypsy as the combine weapons).

You have never said what race you are.  If barbarian, then be sure to stick
to getting medium sized armor, as it weighs less than large, has the same
AC, and you can wear it.  If human or half elf, then you have no choice, you
have to wear medium.  I think Bronze is probably your next step, without
some serious cash to put out anyway, don't recall off hand where medium
bronze drops.  Another possibility is the armor drops in the Warrens, I
don't recall the stats on that armor though.

Wizards and Druids are the only classes that get group teleport spells.  As
a warrior, the only porting you can do on your own is item based.  Don't
worry too much about those for now, it will be a while before you get any of
those.  For now, if you want a teleport, you will have to pay a wizard or
druid for it, this will probably be true for the rest of your warriors
existance, unless you develop a friendship with someone of one of those
classes, and can get free teleports.

Lots of money is the only way I know of to raise smithing.  If you can't
afford it, then don't bother is all I can say.  You will probably never make
a profit on the skill, so only do it if you want to for character
development purposes.
