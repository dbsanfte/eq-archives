Have you checked this with a log of some sort?
Because the last info was that AGI's impact on dodge is so incredibly
minimal (something like 100 point increase might give you a 3% delta),
that it was a waste to even try to raise it.  If it's above a certain
threshhold, there's no real difference either way.

The only thing that should affect damage mitigation is the AC of the
two players.

And no, unless the warrior is totally under equipped compared to a
paladin, there's no way a paladin would have more AC--it *MIGHT* be
comparable since a paladin can in theory have a very high AC shield +
1HS instead of swinging a bit two hander.

Trivia:  What is the single highest AC item in the game?
