All part of the trend to make traveling easier as a continent gets
older. First, there were no ports in the old world - ports were put
in. Kunark was released with one port spot and two other spots you
could only port to from inside a Kunark dungeon - the evacs were
changed to be castable from anywhere. Velious was released with keyed
dragon rings you had to travel to by foot at least once - the keys
were removed. Luclin was released with no port access other than the
spires - Luclin is given port access.

At least they didn't sit down and build druid rings. And since it's
perfectly possible to make up a RP reason for the game changes rather
than whine about how the game didn't stick with the old RP (such as
having people understanding the moon port magics better and getting
more familiar with the moon), I'll be doing that instead.

And yes, I was against druid ports to the moon.
