One thing that bugged me about the D&D movie that showed that the writers
missed some research points was the beholders in the camp of the villain's
army. They reminded me more of the eye things in Big Trouble in Little China
than a beholder. Also, I don't think beholders would follow humans around
like puppes. There were a couple other slips but this is the only one I can
remember ATM.
