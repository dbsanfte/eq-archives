20-40 backpacks is more likely, depending on race and class.

The quest takes 4 bonechips, and adjusts your faction up by 1 (one) point.

8 backpacks * 10 slots * 20 bone chips = 1600 bone chips = 400 quest
turnins.

2000 quest turnins should get you to where people will talk to you, although
the actual number will vary depending on your race and religion.

As an agnostic gnome enchanter, I've done that quest a tad over 400 times
already, and I'm still KOS as a gnome.
