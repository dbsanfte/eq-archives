I think I see what's going on, and you're getting some good answers to
your question, and other good answers, but to different questions.

You need two things to be true in order to go play on Kunark. First,
your account must be registered for it. You had the CD and registered
it, so you have no problems there. Second, your machine has to actually
have those zones loaded on it, which you did on your smashed laptop, but
do *not* on your new machine as you didn't have the Kunark CD's to
install those zones at the time. 

So, you need to load the zones. If you don't want to buy fresh CD's, do
you know anyone who plays EQ IRL and has them? You can just load from
their CD with no worries and then return them. If not, you may have to
knuckle under and buy it.

As to your original question, is it *worth it* to have Kunark? I can't
speak for anyone else, but in almost any level range past 20, Kunark
offers a hell of a lot. Tons of zones and mobs to give you more hunting
options than the original Norrathian package. Towards the high end of
the game it has some of the best zones you'll find. Particularly Old
Seb.
