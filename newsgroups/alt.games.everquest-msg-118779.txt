The only thing I have ever petitioned about was falling through the world.
I don't complain when other players "steal my orc" as you put it.  If
other players are just out to make my time tough in the game, I move on to
another area and deal with it myself.  Everquest is a big game.  There are
many places to hunt and lots of equipment to gather.  There's always some
place else to go.  Coming back to your situation...You stated that you
petitioned twice about it and many others petitioned.  This was all about
the same issue.  Since you were in communication with the other involved,
you could have sent one petition and let the other know when you got a
response.  Sending two yourself and having others send petitions was
unnecessary in that situation.  I'm not saying that you should not
petition when you have heavy suspicians that there is likely a bug.  In
your situation, the best thing to do would be to send one petition, and
while you are waiting for a response, you could keep yourself occupied.
You could either look through message boards and such to see others on
other servers also seem to believe that the quest is broken.  One
possibility is that a recent patch broke the quest, thus you could check
the dates of the posts and if they are all after a certain patch, then the
patch may have caused a problem with the quest.  I would actually suggest
checking message boards before petitioning a GM unless you are absolutely
sure that something is bugged (such as falling through norrath).  While
you are waiting for a response, you could move onto another area and kill
for xp, or hunt for another piece of equipment (I'm sure there are other
items in your arsenal that could be better), or help some newbies, or
practice up some skills, or hunt for money, or explore the world of
Norrath, or anything.  There are tons of things that you could to while
you wait for a response.  Sending multiple petitions just slows down the
process for everyone else.  Be patient with the GMs.  They are there to
help.  You said you "wasted over 200+ man hours" attempting a possibly
broken quest.  I think that you did not waste those hours.  You said that
you talked with other people trying to do the same quest and you still
talk to those people now.  That definately is not a waste.  A big part of
what makes Everquest so popular is the social aspect.  In fact, many
people play EQ for the social aspect more than the urge to have an
incredibly powerful character.  Just calm down and have some fun.  That's
what a game is all about.
