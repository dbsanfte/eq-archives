You can turn off both Torpor and Stoi. I was pretty sure I'd done it
before while healing up from a canni when I suddenly needed to run due
to a bad pull. I just tested it again in game. You can turn off both
spells and neither leaves the detrimental effects behind.

With HoTT (Health of Target's Target) you can see when someone has
gotten agro. Taunt moves you to the top of the agro list +1, so while
it's not very good for maintaining agro, it is good for regaining it
once you've lost it. However, once you've lost it you will notice that
Taunt fails far too often, so you just end up mindlessly bashing it
all the time, just on the hope that it will do some good. =)

The good thing about stuns is that even when they are resisted, they
generate lots and lots of hate. A level 9 Paladin can maintain agro
better than anyone else in the game, except a higher level Paladin.
(And only then because the higher level Paladin can maintain the chain
casting of Cease for longer.)
