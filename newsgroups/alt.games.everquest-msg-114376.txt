On a similar note, I need drops from large giant yellowjackets and thorn
drakelings. These spawn between the wall and the Misty side, no where near
the guards, so they should be safe, right? NOPE. Blixken Entopopp (sp) agros
on all the new mobs ... and pretty much kills them with one shot. I saw him
wipe out an entire plague rat/halfling skelly camp in no time flat.

How am I suppose to find these already rare mobs, if when they spawn an NPC
is hunting them down also?
