Most people doing "drive by" buffs just do it for the simple enjoyment of
it.
I like buffing people on the run past, even more so if I manage to do it out
of range of the "so and so is casting a spell" message so they never
actually
find out who buffed them.  :-)

> But if I am seeking a buff, what is customary to donate??

donations, if offered, just go by the "gut" feeling of what you can afford
to offer for the service, AND if you actually want/need the buff.
I can't keep track of how many times my 20th level shammy keeps getting
drive by SOWs cast on him

while at the bank:
Just hold down the shift button and click on the stack of coins you wish to
"exchange", then drag it over and drop it into the next higher stack of
coins.
They will automatically convert.
ex/ dragging 200 copper and dropping it into the silver coin "slot" will
convert
it to 20 silver; dragging it to the gold coin "slot" converts it to 2 gold.

I played for 5 months before I finally discovered this by accident.
