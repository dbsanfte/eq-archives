Not at all. There are decidely non-ubah guilds on my server who already
use DKP systems and the like. Ours doesn't. We use NB4G random except on
big stuff which is honor awarded by the GL and Elders. But for the ones
who do use it in a working fashion, I can also understand why they feel
they have to implement it that way.

Never said they shouldn't be able to participate. Raiding can be great
fun, even if you only go once in a while. But if you "have a life
outside EQ", or just don't care for raiding, etc. etc. you also
shouldn't be surprised if the guild and the loot system itself aren't
raining down uber items on you.

Well, I still don't fully understand the way the system is implemented
in Lances guild apparently, because that doesn't seem to happen in the
ones I've seen. If you and I are in the same guild, and you attend twice
as many raids as me, yes.. pretty soon you are going to have, let's say,
100 DKPs and I'm only going to have 50. However, There's no way that you
are going to get *all* (or even nearly all) of the loot the way Lance
describes it.  Will you get the good loot first? Certainly! And you'll
have earned it for your heavy attendance and service to the guild, so
bravo! But when you "Get" that loot, you're going to blow a bunch of
your points. Soon, while I was unable to gain any loot, I didn't spend
any points either. So after you've spent a bunch of yours on
Uber_Item_01, the next time it drops, I'll be up to 75 points, you'll
have blown a bunch of yours, and *I* will be the one getting
Uber_Item_02.

In the long run, you'll still get stuff twice as fast as me, and
generally get it first, but I'll get mine. If there is system out there
that let's the highest point value members *keep* getting all the good
drops with no "spending penalty" allowing others to catch up, I'd be
shocked if anyone stayed in that guild long.
