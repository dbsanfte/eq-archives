Ah, the Firepots.  A pet subject of mine.

Once upon a time, Verant was planning to put into place a system of travel
known as MIRAGUL'S HIGHWAY; firepots allowing transportation from one region
to the next.  The only surviving (from nerf) pots still functioning are
found in TimDeep.

I have made up a full page at a site for those who wish to learn, and
contribute, to the subject:

HTTP://HOW.TO/STAYHIDDEN  follow the Firepot link at the top.

I'll check out this Pot, for documenting.  There is also another one in the
end of 3rd Gate, Neriak.  More I'm sure.  If people can provide locales of
the remainders, I'd be grateful.  That info can be provided here, or through
the site's NOTES link to an ezBoard.
