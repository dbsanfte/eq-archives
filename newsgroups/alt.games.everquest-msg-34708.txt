Sounds like plenty of flames to go around.  Is there some reason you had to
tell him what the critter dropped, or do they ALWAYS drop greaves?

Is there some reason why you couldn't petition?  I mean, I know it was 3am
but that doesn't mean no one was around.  And if he admitted to trying to
get you killed /report works just fine too.

Was he guildless?  If anon, did you do a /guildstatus on him?  If he was in
a guild is there some reason you didn't contact them to see if they could
put a leash on him?

Yup, he was an idiot but by your own admission, you proved to be an ass,
too.
