[Snip reasons]

One thing that's not particularly germane to this group[1], but
should be remembered for other groups: Some Usenet users are
visually impaired. Imagine the hell top posting is for them; having
to hear the computer read a one-line response, then getting the
entire thread recited to them, trying to remember what the hell the
top-poster said. If you don't think it's bad, try yourself: I'd
imagine that most decent newsreaders will function with text-to-
speech programs.

some reason.
