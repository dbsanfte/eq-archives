Since everyone is posting about the attack, I would like to bring the attention
to something. Thousands of people are stuck in cities that are far away from
where they live because of this. Since they cant fly home, they will have to
rent rental cars, taxis, trains, etc.

Who do these people send the bill to since they have to spend extra money? Does
the FFA pay for it or the government? And if neither refuses to pay, who do
they sue? I mean what laws are there to protect people over this
