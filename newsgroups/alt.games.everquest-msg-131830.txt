First of all you don't need to be 30th level to go to SolA.  25+ is fine
which means you only need to make about 5 levels instead of 10, especially
if you are going as part of a raid.  Paludal would be the easiest place to
level quickly to 25.  If you play that much you should be able to make 25-26
by Sunday.  Past 26 the exp in Paludal is not as good, but like I say you
don't really need to be 30th level for SolA unless your guild is adamant
about it.

Good Luck, SolA is a lot of fun.  The first real dungeon I went to and now I
am playing my shaman alt there and hitting some places I didn't go before.
