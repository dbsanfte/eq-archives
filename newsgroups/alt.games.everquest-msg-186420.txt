Not bad for a first one... It may have been rendered more fashionable 
with the addition of the insult-du-jour "asshat", unless you are more 
traditionally inclined, in which case "fuckwit" or "dumb shit" would 
have done nicely. For the ironically minded, "capitalist pig-dog" is 
adequately post-modern, and if you want to enhance your standing with 
the media-savvy, a direct lift from South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut 
never goes amiss... My personal favourite is "ass spelunker".

You can also throw a curveball by resorting to a fashionably old-
fashioned one like "foul knave", an outright surrealist one like 
"fishmonkey", a classy foreign one like "connard" or an alliterative one 
like "repugnant rectum-reaming rat-rapist".

But having said that, I cannot really fault your choice... "moron" is 
pretty much the Swiss-army knife of flammage, or rather like the 
Winchester six-shooter... Always ready to be pulled out and fired off at 
a moment's notice, with devastating results.

Welcome to the world of flaming, may your career be long and reputable. :)
