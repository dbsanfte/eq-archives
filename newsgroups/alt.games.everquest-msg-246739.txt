I find spell effects in a busy (even nonraid) fight can even obsure 
critcal items ... like incoming adds.

But overall that's wonderful, and for those of us with the money to 
burn, by all means... But for the average person, or even my 2nd 
computer, which i barely look at ... I don't need any of that.

Top cards with a top system. Absolutely. Average cards in average 
systems... you have to to make choices. If everyone had top cards in top 
systems then this would be a nonissue.

Not at all. 26FPS is playable. If I've eye candy turned on and im 
getting 26fps then I really ought turn the eye candy off. But if I'm 
running bare bones settings, and I'm getting 26fps then the game is 
playable. Its not optimal, and for a game like eq in particular... its 
adequate. If my 2nd box gets me 26fps that's plenty.

As I said, if I'm pusing 60+fps with FSAA turned on, then yeah I'll have 
it on. But I'm not going to recommend someone upgrade a 9800XT or fx5900 
to an X800. Either of those cards should be fine until the next 
generation of video cards. If you *want* to upgrade to the latest 
greatest by all means... but telling people they *need* to upgrade their 
ti-series geforce 4s to play EQ... that's just plain silly.

26fps sustained fps in eq in particular is not too slow. It is the edge 
of playable, but its fine if that's your nominal fps. IF that's your 
maximum fps, and it drops down to 10 when the scene gets busy then yes 
its not playable, but that's not what I've ever suggested is.

That's great.

But that doesn't change the fact that the average persons screen is set 
to a refresh rate of 60Hz. They aren't seeing *anything* over 60fps 
because the monitor *physically isn't even displaying them*.

If the monitor only updates 60 times per second it will display a 
maximum of 60 frames... not one more, not ever. Granted some people run 
  screens as high as 120Hz... but that's not the point, that's not the 
average person.

There is no "why not". I said myself that I'll turn it on at the 60+ fps 
mark.

ROFLMAO. We're discussing my 2nd box, remember. I can see exactly what 
im supposedly missing because my 1st box is 6 inches to the right. 
Figuring that my 2nd box is a ti4600, a P4 2.8fsb800, audigy2, 1gb 
ram... and its my main box where the my newest and best components 
are... how much do you really think im missing out on?

I'm just not some graphics/hardware snob that thinks anything less than 
a 6900ultra or X800 is in desperate need of an upgrade to obtain a 
satisfactory playable experience in EQ.
