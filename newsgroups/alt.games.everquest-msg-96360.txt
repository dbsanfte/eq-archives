I've brought my Erudite Necro up to 29 and although the spell cost is high I
can't recall ever having a problem affording them. Of course, after buying
my spells I had zip for armor and other necessities. This is my first
character, so I had no idea where to hunt to get the most money, but I
looted everything I could and sold it all, I would put off buying anything
till spells were payed for. It was tough at first but as I got higher in
level it started to become easier and easier. Now at 29 I normally have my
next level spells bought and payed for before I make it out of the one I
just scribed spells for. I never got my DE Necro up past 5 and spent most of
my early life in the BB and EF area, so I'm not familiar with that area for
lowbies.
