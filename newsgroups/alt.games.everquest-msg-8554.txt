From what I can work out it wasn't Verant/EQ but alt.net's routers (again)
or another companies routing to Alt.net. If EQ went down everyone would
eventually get kicked, I had the same problem no matter what ISP I used but
my friends had no problem, difference is they use a Cable company and I use
BT. Took little over 1/2 an hour to get back on bit annoying when you were
grouped and the rest of your group is still there but you're not (oh well I
guess that way we don't lose our spot)
Players on server dropped by about 1000 (to about 1300) (on BB other servers
like E'ci reported on eq.com as sub 100 players) but didn't drop any lower
and finally everyone got back on. More of an inconcenience than downtime.

Duke Nukem, hmmm there's a blast from the past, cut my multiplayer FPS teeth
on that game.
