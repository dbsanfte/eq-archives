Against blue mobs, it's damn near useless.
The delta on your damage output from the mana burned it's better to
just not bother since even if the effect is minimal the aggro it
generates isn't.

Against white/yellow/red cons and ESPECIALLY those mobs that "proc"
Flurry/Rampage, Cripple line is anywhere from useful to "GOD DAMMIT
GET THAT FUCKING MOB SLOWED AND CRIPPLED NOW OR WE"RE DEAD!!! (Read:
Someone just pulled two Defenders)."
