I am still very new to EverQuest, this being my first 4 or 5 days. I
started a Druid on Solusek Ro and have gotten him up to level 7 as of
this evening. Nothing to crow about but It's progress.

I am a 3+ year veteran of Ultima Online and thought I'd give EQ a
tryout. Enjoying it so far so We'll see how it goes. 

I am wondering though how to make money. It is obvious to me that
fighting these MOB's and selling what I can get off them isn;t going
to net ne big bucks for a long time yet. So I was wondering What some
of you more experienced players feel are good ways to make cash?
