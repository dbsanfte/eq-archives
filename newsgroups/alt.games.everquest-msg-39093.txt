There is got to be a third factor involved in the price you get from
vendors, besides the obvious Charisma and Faction. With a Charisma of
95, the vendors around the bubbling pot in Qeynos, who are "amiable" to
me, and Human to boot, offer me less than half the money for my goods
than vendors of the same race and faction standing around Freeport, and
even less than druids that con "indifferent" to me (probably because
they worship Tunare and I worship Karana, and I haven't done many Druid
quests).

So, what could the hidden factor be? I thought it could be simply race,
(for example, my faction in Rivervale is very good, and yet, I can't get
good prices there) but this last experience with the Human vendors in
Qeynos blows that theory out of the water.
