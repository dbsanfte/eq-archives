My 50 Iksar Shadowknight on The Rathe is decked out in full dreadscale
armor with greenmist arms and mask (greenmist comes from Fear plane).
He has a Mace of the shadowed soul and clay guardian shield. I soloed
with him from level 1 till now... fear kiting is the bomb and I could
do it very well with him. I currently have him in dreadlands soloing
blues. The regen bonus is very nice and allows for easier soloing. Oh
and I just got him Jboots a couple weeks ago (lucky in SRO I guess).

My 50 Gnome Cleric on The Rathe is also logged in Dreadlands. His
equipment is rather mundane. His wisdom is only around 165 with the
equipment I had on him, but the difference in mana pools is rather
negligible in my opinion if you know what you are doing (besides it
was no more then 300 mana difference between 165 and 200 wisdom). I do
have him in nobles robes right now (decent resists robe that drops in
MM now) and sorta makes him look non-cleric.

Each of these characters have all their spells... except the Cleric
who still needs Celestial Healing (level 44 spell that drops in
Velious). The Shadow Knight does not have Life Leech yet either. That
still needs to be quested.

The level 18 bard on Tallon Zek is in rather spartan gear... he can
solo too... using the dot/run/kite method... I played there thinking
I'd be interested enough with Pvp to keep playing EQ... but the flame
has gone out and I must now take my leave of EQ.

All my characters were never in a guild... I just did pickup groups or
soloed. Their reputations are pristine.

For any inquiries, please email me mooltar@hotmail.com.

I will sell this account outright for $300.00
