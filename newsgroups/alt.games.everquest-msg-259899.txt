You're right, but (since the topic is WoW) do you think it's a good game 
design for a MMOG that the "solution" when you're OG is to not play with the 
MM? I've played on battle.net for years, I was there the day it opened up, 
and throughout those years I've come to the same conclusion: no public games 
for me, strictly private games with friends. This has worked well for me 
because I have a ready group of family and friends who enjoy playing 
together. But we can do this same thing with *any* LAN game. So, in the end, 
what's the point of an MMOG if you're not going to play in public games? 
With Diablo I could always rationalize this by remembering that it was not 
an MMOG, that battle.net was basically an online service in lieu of LAN play 
for me and my friends. But with WoW, that's not the case and if the same 
mentality prevails, it's a showstopper imo.
