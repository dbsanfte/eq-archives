IMHO, it would be more correct as follows:

Primary role: Melee damage, ranged damage, buffing

Secondary roles: Pulling, debuffing, tanking

Tertiary roles: Crowd control, patch healing, utility


They do excel at ranged damage above all other classes. Though the number 
isn't great, encounters do exist where ranged DPS is desired over melee.

I've always felt that if they weren't meant to tank, they wouldn't have 
been given the Taunt skill. Their being a chain class obviously relegates 
that to a secondary skill, but still an emphasis.

I added "utility" to cover additional group-beneficial skills such as group 
camo, tracking, snare, etc.
