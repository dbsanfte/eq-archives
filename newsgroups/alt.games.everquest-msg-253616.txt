Just something I'd like to see on raids:

/stfu

The devs would probably call it something more polite, of course. The
command would be available to the raid leader, and would prevent
anyone in the raid from /saying anything or hailing anyone: those who
try get the message "You try to say something, then think better of it."
Possibly the command coulb be applied to any single channel: /stfu say,
/stfu rs, etc.Just to keep the channel clear at certain times. With /say
locked, however, no one will hail a planar projection early. Some will
try to get around this by /raiddisbanding, but possibly it could be made
so that they also have to zone out and zone back in first.

  Similar idea:

/zonelock

  Would prevent any current member of the raid from leaving the current
zone.
Possibly could be made so that the whole raid zones with the raid leader:
when he
zones, everyone else moves with him to his target zone, wherever they happen
to be
in the current zone at the time. Otherwise, they can't leave the zone
themselves.
That way Fear raids won't wipe because of some people's reluctance to go
early:
suddenly you're in and you HAVE to fight. Not useful in some instances, some
leaders
will prefer to have an experienced break-in team to clear a beachhead.

Just some wild ideas...
