Just a compleatly random thought about this. When I started 2+ years ago,
you had to go sell every 10 minutes. Not that this was a bad thing,
selling=gold=armor ect. when your starting out. But now, starting out
(again) 50% of that time they drop nothing, 30% of the time they drop crap
and just 20% of the time they drop something useful. (I just made the
precentages up based on my own observations.)Trying to do a noob quest on
Lucin, I level 2 1/2 levels so that the quest was basicly nill and still
didn't have all the components. Whats the point of nerfing noob kills?
