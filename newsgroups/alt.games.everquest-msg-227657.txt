   *Gasp* You're not talking Age of Discovery on test, are you?  Because that
progression was Jazz to you to me.  And maybe the talking big and doing little
parts might fit, I hardly was a brand new member.

    Actually, that guild in the end just fell apart due to lack of interest.  I
think the /testbuff command is what finally did us in.   We had all worked up
from untwinked to just get past that level, then *boom*, it all seemed like for
nothing.  Anyways, Lenny logged on not too long ago and found he didn't have the
tag, though I hadn't deguilded him (or anyone, for that matter).  I logged on,
and still have the tag.  So I guess that technically it's still an active guild.
