That's true - or, it's never been proven otherwise by anyone.

But, Dan's suggestion is -doable- if they wanted to do it.  More coding, 
more bugs, more exploits.

They could use their replacement strategy they implement now and then when 
they need loot to change on a living mob.  They could try to do this with 
a dead mob, so that the mob doesn't have any loot on it when it spawns, but 
when it "dies", it is immediately replaced by a corpse that has the "timed" 
loot on it.  There's the problem of turbo-clickers that may loot the mob in 
the nanosecond before the corpse is replaced, and I'm sure other problems 
with that, but it's one way they could implement it.
