Emotionally, I'm with you here; Norrath is its own universe, founded in 
part on a principle of equal access, and I prefer that it remain so, 
with as little connection to the real world as can be managed.

BUT, I have to say, there's something in MJ's arguement here too. While 
its possible to have a fantasy universe in which we don't want the 
wealth we have in the real world to affect what our characters can do in 
-their- world, thats not the only possible model.

I used to play an online "card" game called ChronX.  Similar in a way to 
Magic The Gathering which people are more familiar with.  At any rate, 
ChronX was, like MTG, set up as its own fantasy universe with a back 
story and so on... but the mechanics of your "character" involved 
utilizing the resources you had available in the form of virtual cards 
in your virtual deck... and you could purchase those cards in randomly 
assorted packets.  People with more cards -tended- to be more 
powerful... but skill at play, and to some extent luck, mattered quite a 
lot as well.  WHile the parallel with EQ isn't extremely strong, I 
mention it to demonstrate that an interesting and moderately successful 
MMOG can be run with real world resources of the players (and their 
willingness to expend those resources on what are, after all, just bytes 
and bits)  as part of the environment.

There's no philosophical reason that something similar couldn't be done 
in a fantasy universe like Norrath; call your real world person a God 
and your character an Avatar, and whatever you, the God, supply to him 
in the form of Manna would just show how powerful that God is and how 
much he Favors his follower.  Would players enjoy that as much as a 
setup where there's a firm ethical line drawn against that (even if its 
not being enforced very well these days)?  Perhaps not... but its an 
idea that could be tested to see whether its economically viable (in the 
real world, that is)

Do I want this to happen to EQ?  No, I'd sooner see them instead try 
harder to stop the cheating thats currently going on in this vein.

But would I like to see it tried?  Sure.  And I'll tell you a very 
simple way to try it.

New server.

Allow anyone that wants to to transfer their character from their 
current server to there.  NEVER EVER ALLOW THEM TO TRANSFER BACK OUT. 
Lock them in with the rest of their cheating kind and throw away the 
key!  Er, I mean, "to preserve the integrity of the old school servers, 
the transfer is one way".  At any rate, on that server, and only that 
server, implement an option at the login screen that allows you to buy a 
Credit for one US dollar, and to sell any Credits you may have for 95 US 
cents.

Cap the server size at 4000 or so, whatever their servers usually are 
capped at, and if demand is THAT high, open another server and so on, 
till you reach the right crowding level.  If you have multiple CASH 
servers, allowing transfer of Credits from one to another should be allowed.

Sadly, if we're really wrong about how many people would want to do 
this, they'll probably have to cannibalize some of the current servers, 
because the idea behind this is to do it with relatively low cost.  So 
they'll have to start combining old school servers with low crowd 
levels.   But if its Really popular, that won't be neccessary, they can 
reverse my idea, make a few designated OLD SCHOOL servers and allow 
massive migration to them, and make all the current servers CASH based.

As long as nobody from a CASH server ever gets an opportunity to move to 
an OLD SCHOOL server, I'm willing to put up with the potential that they 
might force a shaking up of the current server setup... particularly 
since my own guess is that there won't actually be all that much 
interest in moving to those CASH servers in the first place.
