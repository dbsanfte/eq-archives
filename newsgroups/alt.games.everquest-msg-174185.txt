Communism lost. Welcome to the 2000s. Reality is different.

Yes, you should pull out of Saudi Arabia. If they want Iraq ruling
them - and Iraq would be a better ruler than the militant Islamic
extremists that would otherwise be there - who are you to say
otherwise?

The cold war is over. Time to figure that out.

Your foreign aid is universally tied to opening markets, which leads
to raping the countries resources for profits that end up in a
multinational boardroom.

There is more than just "this way or no way at all", you know.

I am not the one suggesting attacking everyone we disagree with. It's
been noticed many times now that the people in charge of the current
policies are in love with war, but (for the most part) have never been
a part of one and include draft dodgers and are led by someone who
skipped out on his duties for months.

Not that I overly blame them. I wouldn't be prepared to lay my life
down for these bozos and their quest for personal glory either.
