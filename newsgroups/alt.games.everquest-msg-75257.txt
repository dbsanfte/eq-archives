> Just finished running it and got an 809.  Gonna try the 4in1 update.

what video card and drivers??

And what's the number now(after installing 4in1)??

My buddy blew up a MB a while ago and the new MB was a VIA(Tyan)...he was
getting 500-700 on 3dmark2001 (p3 667/GF2 pro)...then after installing the
4in1(because the place that installed the board forgot to) his numbers were
in the 2400 area...
