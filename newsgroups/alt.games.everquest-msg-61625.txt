I just posted about this somewhere else....if you read what was written and
the info in the KB, they're talking about win95/windows for workgroups
specifically.....not win98/me.... I would hope no one playing eq is using
win95.....Win98/me has no problem with 512meg of ram....I THINK at 768meg
and higher you COULD have a problem but this is also fixable and this info
is in the KB....
