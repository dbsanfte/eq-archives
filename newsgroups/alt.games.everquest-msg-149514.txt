The actual EQ file that loads yer type of video card, then loads the eq
specific driver settings for that device is: eqhardware.ini

The specific problem you're having has more to do with eqclient.ini settings
for Luclin, I am thinking. I have a different video card, but had a similar
problem when I loaded Luclin. Try these additions/changes to you
eqclient.ini file before giving up:

under [DEFAULTS} add these lines:
UseTNL=FALSE
UseUmbra=FALSE

For reference, the UseTNL line toggles between true and false, and turns
off/on hardware texture and lighting. UseUmbra also toggles, and this turns
off and on a function of EQ that buffers some information while zoning...
and yes, it includes while first loading *from experience*.

Hope this helps.
