Are you tashing before charming. That always makes a big difference. 
*shrug* I've seen some last for a second and some last for about 5 mins. 
When you send your critter against the other make SURE the other is 
rooted at all times. That way if charm breaks you only have one to deal 
with ... stun and recharm. Of course my enchanter is only 20 so I'm sure 
others (Dan? Do you charm?) will have better advice.
