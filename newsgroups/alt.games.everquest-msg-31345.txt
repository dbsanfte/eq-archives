Gynok has an approximate 6 - 6 1/2 hour spawn rate.

Pop your head into Befallen, if someone is camping him ask how long they've
been there. Ask them to send you a tell if they decide to leave, or when
they get their ring. Once you learn the spawn time, arrive an hour or two
before the next one and grab the camp. Or check back in the wee hours of the
morning. Basically you have 4 chances a day to nail the bugger.

If you find the camp empty and have the time to wait the whole six hours, go
for it!

But remember, Gynok is the easy camp, The Fungus Mutant has made grown Ogres
cry.
