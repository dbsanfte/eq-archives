<snip raid group info>

Thanks for posting. This is sweet beyond belief and a long time in
coming.  Of particular interest is the /rsay function. We still have a
couple people in our guild who have NEVER gotten the chat channels to
work, so when we're on a raid with allies they have to rely on people in
guildchat, etc. for information.

I'm curious about the xp division. With the announcement saying you will
get significantly less experience, does that just refer to the fact that
you'll be dividing it up among a lot more people, or is there some sort
of additional penalty?

Example:  If six of us currently group up and kill something, and we're
all level 60, we get (roughly, depending on modifiers and penalties) 1/6
of the mob's xp value plus ZEM, etc.  If we have one more level sixty
friend show up who wants to join us and we form a raid, will we all get
1/7th of the mobs XP? Or is is penalized because we're now in a raid?
And what happens to the group xp bonus in this case? Do the original six
still get it? Does the ungrouped seventh get no bonus?

Inquiring minds want to know!
