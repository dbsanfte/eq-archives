Having played a necro a while back for 26 levels (not much, admittedly)
and playing my higher level characters grouping with them a lot, I can
only laugh at the idiots that keep espousing this. We've been working
the wizard/necro duo in multiple zones for a while now, both pushing
fifty, and it's still one of the most consistently effective pairings
I've seen. Our death rate compared to our previous warrior/cleric duo is
miniscule, and the xp gain and leveling rate is insane.

The other night in Skyfire we were in an all caster group pulling some
mobs that were often red to me and the necro.  With her there, we could
fear kite them along the wall, have crowd control, and when things were
flowing very smoothly, extra nukage. Even when the CC aspects totally go
to shit, a necro can often bail out the group's collective butt by
dragging a troublesome add far away, aggro kiting, and FDing if required
to get them off our asses. A well played necro is one of the most
versatile classes in the game. Pity they solo so well too, because that
rep makes a lot of them just say "fuck it" and not bother grouping with
us at all.
