Nope, that would be /ran 42.  I suspect the reason is that 420 has some 
significance among marijuana users.  I've been told various reasons why 
it's important, I suspect that some state has 420 as the code-number for 
marijuana possession.  
Now here's a question for you, is /random 420 the same as /random 0 420 or 
/random 1 420?  
One other question, how often do you just /random X vs. /random X Y.  I 
can't think of a random in the last year that wasn't /random X Y 
(generally /random 300 800 seems to be popular if not seeded).  Maybe it's 
all server specific.
