 I always go around with the CF/SoS combo. However "superfast lowdamage
weapons are (not always) so good" due to the aggro factor. This isn't a
real problem in XP grind groups but when you're fighting mean stuff (thx
1100 hit from a VP wurm) you don't want it turning on you. In those
instances I pull out the 2hb. I may not be doing as much damage but I'm
also not draining the clerics mana, either.
