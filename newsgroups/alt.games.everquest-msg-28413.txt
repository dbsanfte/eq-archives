 Do they even visit these 'wasted' zones? The main reason players of the
appropriate level don't utilize these zones is because they are poorly
designed and not worth the hassle. Lower levels don't stay out of zones
like Droga due to famers. They stay out due to bad design (in my
opinion).

  I've spent time in Droga. A lot of times I was the only person there.
I mean, this is a zone that can knock a level 60 with 2400hps (and high
resists and AC) down to a bubble with no trouble. This is a zone with
the zone out, while being the same as the zone in, a long run since once
you drop you can't get back up the same way. These are the reasons
people of the appropriate level don't visit the zones you created for
them, not the fact that they feel high level players are monopolizing
the area.

 Yeah. Who will twink them to high heaven. Unless they make none of the
existing items usable by Val Shir race. I don't see that happening but
you can never tell with Verant.

 I'm sorry you think your existing customers really want that. But
thanks for saving me money since I don't see a need for me purchasing
Luclin.
