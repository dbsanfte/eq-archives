Yep.
The upper 30s appear to be rather dismal until that 39 pet.  I've
noticed soloing in DSP recently that I need to be in there swinging
next to Poochie.  Heck, Poochie cons cyan to me right now!  Egads.  He
still does good work, but isn't nearly as effective as he used to be
on easier/lower mobs.  So... we stick to blues for a few levels while
soloing I think.

I love my beastlord.  no doubt about it.  For pure soloing any way,
anywhere though?  Give me my bard.  (when my wrists are up to it at
least)
