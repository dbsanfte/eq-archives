Im not certain, but I dont see that there would be any stacking issue here.
One decreases movement speed (chain) while the other decreases attack speed
(binding). Snare and enchanter slow stack, so why not.
Bard slow isnt that great, and if your cleric can keep up with the healing
you dont need it. Indeed if theres a damage shield on the MT, then you are
slowing down the killing. Just use binding if the cleric needs to med
between fights. Also chain doesnt need to be used until the mob starts to
flee. Remeber too that with an enchanter in your group, anthem is largely
wasted since the hastes wont stack.
A bard is a bit like a druid, jack of all trades. Do what the group is
missing. If it needs more dps, then sing bellow, anthem etc. If its running
out of mana, then sing manasong. If you dont have an enchanter, then mez
things. etc etc.
