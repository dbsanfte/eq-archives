I did it with my Vah Shir Shaman a number of times.  I was doing it at
level 9, not level 1 so I had SOW.  Back when I did it, I had to get
to Nexus to get my Disease/Poisen spells which weren't on the Moon.

Getting thru the first fiend lake area is very easy  - stay high on
the walls.  The tunnel connecting to the Bandit/Fiend area is the
tricky part.  You have to cross the path a few times to stay behind
the fiends.  The only real problem is a wandering fiend who comes up
the tunnel.  If he is there, he will always spot you so your sunk.

Once you get into the second area (bandit/fiend area), just stay high
on the walls.  With the large numbers in the caverns these days (40+
at times), often the fiends in this cavern are all dead.  Also, I hear
people asking for Invis all the time so that is an option.

Back when I did it, the caverns weren't that popular.  I waited until
I was the only person in the zone so if I caused a train, it wouldn't
impact anyone.

PS They've since added the Shaman 9th level spells into Sharval.  I
think this was a huge mistake.  The most fun I've ever had in EQ was
planning the trip thru the Caverns to Nexus, then down to NK and up to
Halas to buy them.  All kind of zones I had never been in before (I
started playing when Luclin came out).  A real sense of accomplishment
when I did it.
