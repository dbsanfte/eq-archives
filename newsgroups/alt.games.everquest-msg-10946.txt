LOL!

What game do you play? At higher levels Warriors are GODs in EQ. It's
the mid levels where Warriors suffer if they ever really suffer at
all. At mid levels the Hybrids shine brighter due to the spells they
offer when in a group.

People say that warriors take less skill to play due to the fact that
all they do is melee combat. They do not have to worry about which
spells to cast and when. The truth is that a good warrior is just as
busy as any caster. Spreading taunts around durring a multi-mob pull,
and more often than not being the puller for the group keeps them much
busier than just mashing the auto-attack and kick buttons. As primary
tank they are the one resposible for making sure that any mobs rooted
or mezzed are left alone.

Cheers
