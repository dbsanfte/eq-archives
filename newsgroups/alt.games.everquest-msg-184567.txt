Eh, I'm kinda mixed on the new effects. Some of them look nicer and
there are a few here and there that are entirely new. But, on the
other hand, the majority of them are only slightly altered versions of
the old effects, which disappointed me. I was looking forward to the
kickass SOW effect that was on Test... I also don't like that the old
progression of spell effects was all but eliminated ( So far, only the
HP/shielding type buff effect seems to progress, and that's only by
mixing in blue sparkles, and not until after 50 ).
