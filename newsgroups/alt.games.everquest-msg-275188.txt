No question, LFG has sucked big time for a while now.  I log on, ask in 
guild if anyone has room for me, silence from the 10 or so people that 
are online.  I put up LFG, search through the LFG to see if I can make a 
group, I find 6 to 10 people LFG in my level range, nothing close to a 
reasonable group, unless I feel like doing something easy where I can be 
the main healer with a ranger tanking.  I log off in disgust and play 
eq2, put up lfg, and get group invites and tells for groups usually 
within 30 seconds.  As a shaman, it used to be like that in EQ1 too.
