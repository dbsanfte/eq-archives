I've seen poison take 40hp a tick on a level 30 adventure, set off by a
sense traps gone bad.  I was scouting the remaining mobs, so was the only
one not affected.  The poison would not come off, no matter how many times
cures were attempted.  First the int caster went, then the wis caster and
last the paladin.  I think that it was really a curse, but everyone said
they had a poison symbol.  I fealt like I was in a hospice, watching
everyone die and not able to do anything except comfort them.  I was happy
In didn't lose any of the exp I had just gained for the adventure, and not
ashamed by that, either.
