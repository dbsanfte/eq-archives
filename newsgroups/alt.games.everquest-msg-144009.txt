The mob doesn't have a way to travel from the upper to lower room.
Therefore pulling him from one to the other is a pathing exploit.

Compare that to Dain, another mob pulled via warping.  In that case,
Dain DOES have a path from the upper level to the lower level:  he
can jump down the well just as players do.  The logical place to
fight Dain is below, where he banishes people, so they can rejoin
the fight.  The question is how to *legally* get him down there.
And, in that case, the answer is to get him to jump down the well,
which seems to be warping from the player's perspective (and is from
the game's perspective as well.)

Logically, though, Dain SHOULD be able to get to the bottom of the well
AND he should jump down the well instead of pathing all around the zone
to get to the bottom.  He's humanoid, fits through the well, it's the
shortest path, etc.

That's a different case than causing a mob to warp that's not meant
to be able to travel from one area to another or causing a mob to
warp past other mobs he would aggro if he followed the logical path.
I've watched people pull the Chardok Royals to zone, for instance.
They did that via a chain of non-KoS people.  At no point did any
of the mobs "warp."  That's not an exploit;  that's tactics.  (But
more trouble than it's worth...)   Having a non-KoS person aggro
the Queen, however, and then CotH them back to zone without that
CotH clearing aggro would cause the mob to warp.  THAT would be an
exploit;  the mob shouldn't warp, it has a path to zone it should
follow.
