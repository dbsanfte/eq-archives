Ice Burrowers do not summon.   Really.  They really don't.  I know its unexpected.
Its sort of a secret, must be, because you'd expect them to be hunted out 24/7 and
everyone to know about it.

For ages, they were worthless to hunt.  You see, it takes about 15 minutes to take one
down as a solo druid using root/rot techniques.  Something you might do to say you'd
done it, or perhaps camp out a monk and hunt them to get their rare drop tunic.

But a change some time ago to the exp system vastly increased the exp reward for
killing high level creatures.  As one of the few non summoning mobs over the level of
60, these guys were suddenly hot prey.

Then they introduced PoP, with quite a few attractive targets and a nice ZEM that WW
is lacking, so now they are back to the level of notable curiousities, by and large,
although amusing to hunt if you are awaiting a TOV/DN raid or something.
