What you basically want to do is find a vendor where you should find what
you want (eg the inns in EC for spiderling silk), make sure you have ONE
piece of whatever you're looking for, then buy out ALL of one thing from the
vendor (spider legs, rusty weps, fishing grubs, non-default inventory booze,
etc) then sell the vendor the thing you're looking for, it will take the
empty slot, and then you can buy it back along with all of the same kind of
item that is on the vendor.

If you only get the one sample you sell to the vendor back, then he doesn't
have any of what you're looking for.

Note:  this technique does NOT work on the Tarew Marr server, there's
specific coding in place to prevent it, so don't even try  =)
