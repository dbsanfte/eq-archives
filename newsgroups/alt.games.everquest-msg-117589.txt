Yes, eqatlas maps are far superior to anyone else's I've found...but I,
personally, prefer a mediocre or even a BAD map to none at all.

How hard is it to find a good map of Fear or Hate?  They're outdoors square
zones, for cryin' out loud, and have been out for almost 3 years.  PoA
should be simple to map, as would PoG, though since those two have only been
out for less than 2.5 years I'll give him some leeway there. :p

PoM I can understand...not a lot of people (relatively speaking) have been
through there.
