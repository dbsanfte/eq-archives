As much as I enjoy selling off my old stuff, every so often I run into the
player that is really into the character and not just wargaming it.

So there I was... :)
...... trying to sell my bows and arrows in Kelethin and this Level 4 Ranger
comes up and asks how much.  As it turns out he had so little money but said
so in RPG-speak.  I figured I made a few sales that day already so I gave
him the bow and 40 arrows for a single GOLD piece. (Just to keep him
honest.)  If he had asked me for a free bow, I would have said no but since
he was genuinely apologetic for feeling he was wasting my time, I let him
have it.

Staying in character goes a long way in my book.
