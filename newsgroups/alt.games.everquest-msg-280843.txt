Sue the seller for damages. You have a transaction record. The fact that 
its against the EULA to xfer chars is irrelevant. The other party can't 
deny that he entered into a transaction to transfer you his rights to 
the account. Nor can he deny that you paid him. 

You want to piss IGE off? call them as a witness to the transaction, as 
they brokered the so called "sale".

The judge will more than likely rule that the other guy misrepresented 
the sale of the account, and by reclaiming it violated his agreement to 
sell it you, and award you damages (at least what the acct cost, and 
possibly court costs too.)

If your bored, follow up by sueing IGE for damages too.

Of course they may have weaseled around it by selling you an account 
password or some such nonsense. But in small claims court judges are 
surprisingly pragmatic. (Not "Judge Judy"'s ridiculous antics. But 
they'll call a spade a spade as often as not.)
