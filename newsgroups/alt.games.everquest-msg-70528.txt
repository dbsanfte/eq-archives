I guess it's time for me to think about getting my revenge on Xytl, have
been meaning to for some time.  So far, I've managed to scratch off Dorn,
Goombah (sp?), Gix, Any DE guard in Nektulos.  My list now has Holly, Xytl,
and the goons in OT.  I don't think I'm ready to think about the OT goons
yet.
