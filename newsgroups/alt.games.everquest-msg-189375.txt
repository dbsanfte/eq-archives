I think you just found your solution. :) Give the free version of Tiny
Personal Firewall a shot. In my humble opinion, Zone Alarm is crap. TPF is
easier to use, caught everything I threw at it, let me run servers without
too much hassle, and most importantly allowed my computer to boot up. Some
installations of Zone alarm wouldnt even let me reboot. Hulking pile of
crap.

Theres a reason Zone Alarm is free. TPF shouldnt be free, but thats why the
link to the free version isnt even on their website anymore - its too
good... http://www.tinysoftware.com/tiny/files/apps/pf2.exe

Boy I hate Zone Alarm. :P
