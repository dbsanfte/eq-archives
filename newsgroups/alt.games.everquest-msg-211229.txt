Aoebe is in need of some faction in Shadowhaven.

She has done the first errand for Henry, and was on the way
to drop off a book to Thag(?) in fungus grove, the very end.

Now, Aoebe is level 24, human cleric, with some nice gear that
tradeskill sales funded, but took one look at a 'boggiling warrior'
and about wet herself, and gated out.

How can she do this quest, would invis work?  All she has to do
for christs sake is give the dumb merchant a book and gate.

Aoebe.
