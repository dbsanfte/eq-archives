Maybe I'm a little different than how a lot of people play but I only
have one character, and all my time is spent with this character (even
though I've only gotten him to level 10 since November). I have an elf
Paladin named Garalathdelas. It's a name I made up for a character in my
youth during RPG days, though it was a wood elf bard at that time. I
thought it sounded elvish enough so I used it again. The emphasises (is
that a word?) are on the first and third syllables.
