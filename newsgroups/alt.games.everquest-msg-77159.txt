I have XP Pro, now, but haven't installed it, yet.  I am running Win2k 
right now and have no sound.  Here's the setup:

Win2k
Abit BX6-R2
Cel 1.0gig
Elsa Erazor Geforce2 DDR X2
SB Audigy
544 Megs of RAM

I can't get the sound to work correctly, so I'm going to blow away Win2k 
and go with XP Pro, methinks.

Are there any of you that are still having problems with XP and the Audigy?  
The two people I am killing in Kaesora with that have Audigys are both 
running XP and don't have any problems.
