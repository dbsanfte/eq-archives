Every time you hand an item to an NPC, it forces a save server-side.
Normally, such saves are infrequent enough that it doesn't create any
noticeable problem. However, all those people doing several hand-ins a
minute were creating a HUGE load on the server, in addition to the
calculations that had to be made to decide if and what they won for
each item in the individual turn-in.
