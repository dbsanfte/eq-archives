Going from memory here (which makes it a given it will be faulty in some
regard):

Staff of Temperate Flux
J-boots
Four pieces of Fire/Magic resist gear in case of a sudden pick-up raid.
They are; Crown of the Froglok Kings, Golden Diamond Mask, Velium
Diamond Ring, extra Velium Blue Diamond Bracelet

Food, of course: Stacks of Ten lb. Halas Meat Pies and Pings.
Peridots, Jaspers, bat wings, and small portal fragments.
Bandages

I think that's about it for everyday travel.
