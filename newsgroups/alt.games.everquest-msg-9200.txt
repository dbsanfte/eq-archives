Hail Furher Titan!

I was originally going to side with you because you're a fellow enemy of
Bizbee, but after reading your post, you're just like him. -True enemies are
alike in the end.

You need to resolve your problems yourself as opposed to running to
Mindspring with some sob story about "violent" threats and such. Basically,
you're the type in Kindergarten that would get beaten for "tattling" on
someone.

As for off-topic posts, just deal with it. If it really bothers you, don't
read them... pure and simple. The ONLY type of off topic post I think you
have the right to complain about are from the spammers (unsolicited email).

Kill filing is simply the coward's way out, but if you opt to do so, have
fun.
