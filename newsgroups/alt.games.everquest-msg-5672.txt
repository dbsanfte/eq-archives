Has been for several months now.

Actually, it was kinda a work-around: An SK needs 140% the amount of
xp a cleric needs to level... so, all xp a SK gainst is multiplied by
1.4 before being applied. However, they lose 1.4x the amount of xp
when they die. No biggie, since they gain it back faster...

The amount of xp members suck from a group is now based on character
LEVEL instead of their total xp as it used to be.

Sorry, though, racial penatlies are still in effect.
