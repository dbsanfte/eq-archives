Your a monk.  The shawl quest is something you wouldn't ever want.

Take a look at the coldain ring quest instead.. you could get exp on
virtually every steep from 1-10, and most could be done with a little help

As for the armour quests.. don't sweat it, whichever way you go.  The only
pieces of armour your interested in are the bracer (for right click
shurikens) and the pants (very nice ho, right click stam buff).

You probably wont even wear the bracer, and the pants are nice regardless of
them being kael/thurg/SS
