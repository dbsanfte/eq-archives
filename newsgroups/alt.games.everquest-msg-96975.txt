I am pretty sure names are not checked by a guide/gm durring creation.
There is most likely a "dictionary" of common names/words that are not
allowed, as well as a check made against the current list of names
already in use.

Some names are "Bannable", and Osamabin is most likely one that would
fall into that catagory. The decision to Ban, suspend, or change a
name in violation is up to the GM of a given server.

Anyone who would pick a clearly offensive or stupid name deserves what
they get.
