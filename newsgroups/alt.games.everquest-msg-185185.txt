From the shadows, the mysterious Rob Berryhill
<rob_berryhill@hotmail.com> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

>you have to be gated to?

Gate your way into Nexus via scion or port.

Turn 90 degrees to the right.

Go straight, past the scion, it turns left on its own, that's the
zoneline to Netherbian Lair. Zone in.

Go into Netherbian until you come to a crossroads, keeping an eye out
for stray monsters. There shouldn't be any but you never know what has
been dragged around. At the crossroads turn right. Go all the way
down. It leads right to the zoneline to Marus Seru.

Easy as pie.
