Since you seem to don't know, I will tell you what my mage does:

DS the puller when they get back in range, assist puller to send pet in on 
same mob as puller.   Nuke once, sit down and get the mana back, and depending 
one how fast the melee and pet are killing mob, nuke again when I can kill it. 
 In case of an overpull, I will sometimes jump in and use my PB AoE nuke if 
their is no enchanter, and only if the damn tank seems good enough with his 
taunt to keep the mobs off me.


Getting damn sick of people bashing claiming all mages are good for is 
summoning a loaf of bread.  You a member of FoH or something?
