Pickpocket only works on humanoid Mob types (there are exceptions, Goos for
example).

money and certain items can be pickpocket (words, gems, spells)

Posion is applied to your primary weapon slot.  You need to use a piercing
weopon in that slot to make it work.  I is only good for 1 hit before it
needs to be reapplied.   It will disappear if you zone, log or die.  It can
be interrupted and resisted.
