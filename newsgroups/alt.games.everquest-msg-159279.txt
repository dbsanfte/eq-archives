ROFL!

I saw a weird one just today.  Level 62 Cleric friend gets aggro while
coming to rez some folks who died to Barducks Darkpaws in JaggedPine,
so he Roots the dogs and camps to clear aggro rather than bother
fighting them.  My Paladin is there watching him camp out.  Then
all of a sudden a kobold comes over and starts beating on him.  He
stands up and starts fighting it -- with an LD tag on his name.

Odd parts:

1.  He had camped out successfully.  He had done a /camp, and watched
as it counted down to 5 seconds to go, then in another 5 seconds he
got put back to the character select screen, just like any other
ordinary camp-out.

2.  Between every swing on the Kobold, his character sat back down,
then popped back up to take another swing...

3.  It's not like he actually lost connection during the last 
second or so of camping out, he didn't get a "You have been disconnected"
message, nor get tossed back to the login screen.  Plus, we were sharing
the same cablemodem on the same LAN at the time.  Normally, when one of
us LD's out, everyone on the LAN does.  But I was fine.

He was there for quite some time, since more Kobolds kept aggroing.
He finally poofed out after we helped him clear all the dogs.  Once
he blipped out he was finally able to re-enter the game.

The scary part is that I wonder how often this might happen --
if you get jumped and killed "after" you've successfully camped out,
you could come back next week only to find yourself naked and 
your corpse rotted away.
