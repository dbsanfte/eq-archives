That was hilarious.  From someone who has never been on a raid, and won't be
for a long long time, this is the way I see it going:

"Ok, GO!"

( 3 seconds later )

"Shit."

"Clerics Camp."

2 parts of that stand out as the most humerous.  The 2nd funniest part to me
was the Gnome caster who charged the dragons near the end.  The best part
was the guy sitting on the wall who stood up and immediately hightailed it
out.

Thanks to whomever made this film.  Got a good chuckle from the 4 EQ players
here at work.
