    There were some other interesting errors, like how Shissar Fangs (a
Throwing item, 11/15) were able to be used as bow ammunition. The rogue who
did it was getting Deadly Strikes, too.

    I'm just wondering when they're going to fix the error I have. Surely at
some point I'll no longer be at 4198 HPs fully buffed, when my HP display
shows my max possible is 4168. Perhaps they're making up for when HPs on
food didn't work? :-)
