What level druid are you?  My shaman with 131 Wis at the time, at level 28
or 29, started soloing blue giants in FM.  Didn't even have to cannibalize.
Make sure I have sow and levitate up, I am full mana.  Nuke giant, run,
stop, turn slightly, wait 2 seconds, nuke, repeat until giant stops chasing
me, melee to death, and believe me, I suck at melee.  I've done it many
times, at level 31 the Tumps were sometimes blue to me, but still pretty
iffy on soloing, the Hillocks are still blue to me, and are not a problem.
