    There is. Each vendor has an inherent "greed" factor. For good proof of
that, get an expensive item like a Ruby and go from vendor to vendor near
the bank in Kaladim. You'll find that the upstairs merchant gives you the
best deal, despite all of them being on the same faction. It would be VERY
helpful if someone who was indifferent or better to all merchants in zone X
actually went around with maxed CHA and an expensive item, like a Ruby, and
mapped the merchants to see who is best and worst. Hey, Dan - you dried off
from the swimming yet? ;-)
