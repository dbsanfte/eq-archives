the best advice i can give you is DO NOT IGNORE YOUR STARTER QUEST

I have seen too may kitty bards that didn't know that they could get a prity
good PRIMARY USABLE lute off there starter quest .. Yes .. thats a lute you
can use while having a weapon equiped in secondry and less switching of
weapons .. the BIG bugs just outside your dorstep will drop primary usable
flutes ans rarer but brass too .. leaving you with only your starter quest
drum that you can't equip in primary .. but as your drum is the MOST
INPORTANT peice of equipment you will ever own this should realy look ah
getting a good one in the bazaar
