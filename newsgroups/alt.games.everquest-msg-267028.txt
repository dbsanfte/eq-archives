You'll need to check the brokers in each town. Right now player made is
cheaper than store bought. You're best bet is to find the broker in S.
Qeynos (all I know of... I'm not an evil) and either buy from him.

Yes, they're pretty random. As your skills go up you'll get more and better
materials. And yes, server problems suck.

For spells you'll need alchemy for ink (unless player bought). Other than
that I can't really comment. I'm not sure of the recipes myself yet.

I actually like the system. *Much* better than the old carpal tunnel grind
system. There now seems to be a viable crafter "class" out there (very
similar to Horizons).

Life... is like a box of chocolates. A cheap, thoughtless, perfunctory gift
that nobody ever asks for. Unreturnable, because all you get back is
another box of chocolates. You're stuck with this undefinable whipped-mint
crap that you mindlessly wolf down when there's nothing else left to eat.
Sure, once in a while, there's a peanut butter cup, or an English toffee.
But they're gone too fast, the taste is fleeting. So you end up with
nothing but broken bits, filled with hardened jelly and teeth-crunching
nuts, and if you're desperate enough to eat those, all you've got left is
a... is an empty box... filled with useless, brown paper wrappers.
