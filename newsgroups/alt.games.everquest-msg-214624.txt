The casual players aren't reporting much of a godsend yet...but in 
theory at least it should be.

Anyone take a two box into a dungeon? I agree 6-boxxing is really not 
viable for much of anything interesting. (if you have time to play 6 
different games at the same time you can't be doing anything that 
interesting.) But 4 people with a couple two boxers to get it up to 6 
doesn't seem totally ridiculous.

I don't like the fact that the group requirement is 4. Other than that 
I'm impressed with what I've heard. I'd *really* like to be able to take 
a  duo or threesome through a dungeon though.
