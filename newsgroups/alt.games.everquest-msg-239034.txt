Yep, I used to keep an eye out for the drops I needed to have spells 
researched, and even with the entire guild pooling all the research 
drops, it was pretty rare to actually get a spell out of it.  The bazaar 
prices, which I have not checked in a long time, on the research parts 
were totally ludicrous, you could often buy the spells for less at times 
due to the research parts being used for some other more expensive spell.
