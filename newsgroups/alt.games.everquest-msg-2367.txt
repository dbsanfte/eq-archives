Get your hands on a magic 2 or 1 handed weapon and fight wisps in EC,
but mostly in WC between the toll both and EC zoneline. Good exp and
great money 1pp for lightstones and 8pp for greater lightstones. That
will take you to 15. Magic weapon, plus damage shield, plus spells
make them easy pickins.
