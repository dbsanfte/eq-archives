Yeah, we should all attempt to get along, just like Clinton
with his ultra-moderate cabinet that reached across all
party lines.

Oh, wait...nevermind.

Seriously, though.  America has been sharply divided since
the 60's rebelled against the 50's and decided that everything
done before was obviously backwards and wrong, and took a giant
crap on the folks that kept the world free for them.

Hell, when Clinton won I salivated at the chance to see him
push socialized medicine in the arena of ideas.  I would have
loved to see him bump the minimum wage to $20/hr.  I couldn't
wait for him to use the environmental laws as strictly as
possible to shut down 33% of the country's producers and
watch the economy grow-grow-grow!

I mean, we've had such obvious success with forced integration
and the welfare state clearing up all of our country's problems
with racism and completely eliminating poverty for everybody,
why not push it further if they were such good ideas, right?

I also thought that most of his ideas were based on social
engineering and wishful thinking, so that's why I wanted to
see them come to light...to actually be debated instead of
just written up by left-wing media transcriptionists as
utterly brilliant.

So I'd like to see Bush go a more conservative route.
Reform the tax code, because everybody knows that it
is perfectly understandable and that we probably don't pay
enough taxes, right?  Implement his changes in Social
Security, because the Lord knows that the government
does SUCH a better job investing and retirement planning
than I do.  Fix MediCare while he's at it, because I know
that the fact that I turn 65 in 35 more years mean that
it is the rest of the country's privilage to support me.
Hell, mandate that everybody over age 25 must take a
firearms course and then carry a handgun...just watch
crime spiral out of control when normal people will
probably gun down wimmin an' chiruns just to smell the
cordite.

We haven't been a fully "together" country since Korea.
The progressives and liberals and socialist had 40 some-
odd years of trying it their way, moderated from getting
too out of control by conservatives.  Give the compasionate
and the conservatives and the fundies a go at it...it's
not like every idea will pass muster anyways.  Do you
seriously think that Bush in four years will convince
the country to abandon abortion, clap da negroes back
in chains in da fields, strip mine Yosimite valley,
dump some oil and plutonium into all the country's water,
gas the homosexuals, and take away Rosie O'Donnel's kids?

I mean, honestly, what is there _really_ to be scared of?
(Really, I want to hear).
