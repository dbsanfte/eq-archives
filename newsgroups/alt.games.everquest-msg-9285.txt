I've been searching through Neriak with a friend of mine for the
Large Sewing Kit. I have yet to find a vendor who sells the
darned thing, the only advice I have received is to enter the
halfling village, or Oggk?
If anyone has a better solution (such as the loc of the vendor
who sells), I am all ears.
