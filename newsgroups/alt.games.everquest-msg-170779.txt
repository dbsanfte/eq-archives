That would depend largely on the quality of the sex education they have 
received, whether at home or at school.  Thew conservative stance seems to 
be that sex ed should be entirely the parent's responsibility.  Now, did 
your parents know that?  Are parents in general more likely to provide 
that little statistic than a professional sex ed teacher with a stack of 
flyers from the local HIV prevention clinic?

My dad taught me everything I needed to know about the clitoris.  but I 
was pretty much on my own for finding out actual details about STDs and 
contraception.  Luckily, they scare the piss out of me so I was quite 
willing to do the necessary research.  But actually having a sex ed class 
would have been a good thing, in my eyes.  It could have at least pointed 
me toward where to look up more information, as opposed to the Playboy 
subscription dad got me.  Sure, Playboy had some good articles, but... :)
Note that I'm not dissing my dad here, I think he did a very good job, but 
it could have been enhanced considerably by an actual class.

By the way, that 10% you cite varies widely from study to study.  10% is a 
bit on the low end for condom alone, although most studies are rather 
non-specific about how many incidents of sleeping with whom they're 
talking about.  Most literature also doesn't cover the fact that many 
people are allergic to nonoxynol-9, which complicates matters...
