There's not a lot of call for the Cancel Magic line of spells, and other
classes (at least enchanters, not sure of others) do it better than clerics.
By the time there's much need for it they probably wouldn't have a cleric do
it anyway.

I'm NOT saying the spell is useless...not at all!  Not that long ago I was
on 2 computers, playing my char and my brother's.  He was hated by a critter
and he was rooted...HARD, right next to the zone line and was taking a
beating.  I sat down, memmed one of the better in the CM line (I think the
one that cancels 4 buffs and/or negative spells) at a time and cast it on
him, unrooting him long enough to zone.

A more general use is to cast it on critters that have damage shields on so
that you'll have to heal the tanks less.

Another popular use is when there's a critter you know has a lot of buffs,
such as a dragon.  But again, if you're doing dragons, even though Cancel
Magic doesn't seem to aggro TOO much, you'd much prefer if someone else did
it.  When it comes to "let's see, do we want to have the dragon be mad at
the cleric, or the enchanter?" the answer is, inevitably, the enchanter.  In
high level fights no one is more important than the cleric once the fight
starts.
