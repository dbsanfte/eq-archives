Why would the suggestions above necessarily be bad for Druids?

Attaching new areas off of old-world zones doesn't sound like
it says anything about any class; depending on where they are,
druid porting could even be useful again.

The "Underdark" suggestion does refer to dungeons, but underground
areas don't all have to be "indoors".  Large caverns could be
considered outdoor areas.  Heck, the Highpass basement is outdoors
for the purposes of spellcasting.
