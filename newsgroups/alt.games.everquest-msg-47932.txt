Veeshan is free-for-all first-in-force with all the fun that brings :) There
is still the occasional steamrolling/headbutting/toys-out-of-pram throwing
but, hey, it's part of the server's colour ;p
It used to be a real problem when Fear and Hate were the only zones worth
squabbling over but now there is so much content available there's really no
point in fighting over it. If your primary target is taken, go find
something else to do :)
