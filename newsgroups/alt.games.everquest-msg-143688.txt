How about the charges against the Nazis at
Nuremberg?

If my motive is to hurt someone, and they die as a
result, then I may get charged with manslaughter.

If my motive is to kill someone, and they die,
then I may get charged with murder.

Isn't that separating crimes by motive?

I wasn't suggesting that laws would deter motive.
I was replying to your suggestion that, "the law
shouldn't be in the business of enforcing correct
thought", by giving an example that shows it
already attempts to do so.

It is.

The law hasn't got rid of murder either.

In England in the early 1700's, the punishment for
rape, was a small fine. As time went by, the crime
of rape had far more serious consequences, mainly
because the attitude of the public towards women
and the crime changed.

They changed the laws to reflect the outrage felt
by the community.

This is what is happening with the hate crime
laws. The laws are being changed to reflect the
attitude held in society, that if you target a
person because of their race or religious beliefs,
then you will be held accountable.

> and it's stupid to try to legislate it, IMO.

What do you think is the motive behind people
trying to get these laws enabled and/or
strengthened?

Clearly, the person is innocent of any hate crime.
And, if he is falsely charged with a hate crime,
it is for a jury to decide.

You can't throw out laws, simply because there is
a chance someone may be wrongly prosecuted.

If you are saying that there is a much higher
chance of being wrongly prosecuted under a hate
crime law, than any other law, then there should
be some evidence of that. If the evidence is, that
a high proportion of people have been wrongly
convicted, then I would review my thoughts on the
matter.

He doesn't have to prove his innocence.

How is this different from how juries convict on

I see it as quite different. 

In the same way as I see rape of a minor as
different from rape of an adult.

I think it is a different sort of crime and should
be punished as such.

The people I would like to see punished by this
law, are the ones who would probably never have
committed a crime, unless a Jew, or a black, or a
gay victim crossed their path. The sort of people
that believe they are not doing anything wrong by
beating up faggots, or performing a social duty by
tying a black guy to the back of their truck.

To me, its something more than murder. One
definition puts it down as a crime with a message,
a message to all others in that group, that simply
by being a Jew or being gay, we have a reason to
kill you.

I like being part of a society that has the
intestinal fortitude to say "this is unacceptable
and if you act like that, you will pay"
