I believe it is 46 but I have heard recently that it is actually 45, either
way ditch it before it procs. It can be used in groups after then (or by a
ranger solo'ing) but only in open areas and put it away if you are multi
pulling and Mez'ing the adds.

If you like the dam/del ratio of it, get a Crystallized Spider Fang.
