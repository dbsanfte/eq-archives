Have you checked out www.graffe.com?  Go to the forums there and check
out the Library or AE Kiting sections.

There are four places I can think of to quad at your level:

(1) Spirocs in TD.  At your level, you will need a c3 or a partner, as
your mana pool more than likely will not be large enough.

(2) Giants in GD/EW.  This actually gets annoying because of the speed
at which giants run.  Plus you get the added bonus of faction, if it's
the one you are seeking.

(3) Giant fort in BW.  I did these at 47, but I imagine it could be
done at 44.

(4) Your pick of mobs in DL.  Higher than normal hp on mobs, but
doable with a partner.
