Actually the bugs are there and obvious, and yes some of them should have
been dealt with before the game was published, but in reality many of them
simply could not be found earlier given a nearly infinite array of possible
computers that can be used to play this game.  Hopefully, the worst of these
bugs like the slow loading and constant stalling will be fixed soon, there
is already a work around offered on Caster'srealm which may work if you can
figure out how to implement it and find the right files.  Likely though the
problem will be fixed in one of the upcoming patches.

One problem that I think could have been avoided is if Verant had not
suggested that people with intel i810 video cards could avoid problems by
running 512 of memory.  This does not seem to work, but adding a simple
video card does, however, this also forces you to add another sound card as
well as the sound in video systems seem to be integrated on those boards.
While I do not mind making these upgrades and have, in fact, made or am
making them now I wish Verant had chosen to test the capacity of these
boards which were common to a good many PIII systems and given players fair
warning that they tend to cause problems.  Also give the integrated nature
of the video and sound cards they are not easy to upgrade and it would have
been nice to have had forewarning so as to better plan for the problems this
involves.

In all I think this whole upgrade to SOL has gone well and is far ahead of
what I would have expected from Verant's past performance.  Right now I
think the major problem that remains is with loading times and mini-stalls
and this apparently stems from running above the Ram capacity of most
windows systems.  Fortunately there appears to be a fairly easy and reliable
work around to this problem and I expect it to be incorporated into a patch
very shortly.
