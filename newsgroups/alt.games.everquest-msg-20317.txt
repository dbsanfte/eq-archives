They're not THAT far off the path. I accidentally stumbled across them
at level 3. Ran up a hill, saw bandit tents, ran away... :) (Having
watched someone playing the game for a month, I had a pretty good idea
bandits would consider me a snack)
I had no clue where I was the first time I died, 20 minutes or so into
the game. I rerolled my character but can't remember why - probably
just to get rid of my poor corpse, I don't think I changed any of the
stats :)
