Since there is no good reason to have it at 50/50, rather than 100/0 or
0/100, you might as well simply fix that, and then you won't have to worry
about this potential bug.

Work out the numbers: a split other than 0/100 or 100/0 just delays when you
get things.  Let's take a simple case.  Suppose your next two milestones at
50/50 will be an AA ding and then a level ding.

If you go 0/100 until you get the AA point, then 100/0 to level, you end up
leveling at the same time as you would at 50/50.  However, you will get the
AA point quite a bit earlier.  Going 50/50 merely delays getting the AA
point, but doesn't make you get the level any earlier.

If you pick any XP and AAXP goal (e.g, reach level N with M AA point), you
should at any given time be going 100/0 or 0/100 toward whichever milestone
is next.  That will get you to the final goal in the same time that any
split would, but will get you the milestones earlier.  (And, if any of the
milestones let you increase your efficiency, then you may actually reach the
final goal earlier than you would with a split).
