hahha, they don't realize that the lowered charisma is to "balance"
the fact that necro tend to fear-kite a lot.  But it doesn't help, no
necro ever admits to having a problem with fear sticking.

here's some more myths  that prolly aren't around anymore.

- leaving unlooted bodies lowers spawn time of mob (orc camps in EC)
- standing on spawn point will keep a mob from popping (permafrost,
and its verifiable spawn skip bug)
- sitting when bard is playing mana song is a waste of time, med just
as fast stadning up (bullshit)
- rangers can tank
- damage shield makes fiegn death fail (may have been true at one
time)
