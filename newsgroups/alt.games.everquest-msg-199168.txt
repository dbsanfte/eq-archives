i've heard for a long time that there is a secret to getting quillmane to
spawn

c'mon, is there a secret?

isn't it the same deal as with the ancient cyclops? run around, bum rush
everything, kill all, hope it spawns in a few minutes?

i have also heard that there are secrets to making the ac spawn


......it's been 4 years.....can someone just admit if there is a trick, or
otherwise if i still have some foolish newbie blood in me after all...
