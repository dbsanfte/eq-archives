I have been looking for a pair of serpentine
bracers on Xev for the last week with no success.
I am willing to pay 100pp for two. If you have
them for sale, please contact Rosewhite. I will
need time to head to a bank to get the cash, and
with my self-port I can meet you in/near North
Karana, Butcherblock, West Commons or Toxxulia for
the exchange.
