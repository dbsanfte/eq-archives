I had one of these on my iksar SK for a long time. Aside from the
benefits in pulling that have already been mentioned, it also helps
faction worries a *lot* which really helps out these two evil classes,
especially when you're *really* hated like trolls, ogres, or iksars.
And I could run through Kael, where I'm KOS, without even breaking a
sweat, as long as I kept to a certian path. Invis only stays up a
random amount of time, and you don't want it to drop at the wrong
moment, which it always seems to have a knack for doing. With the CoS,
you didn't have to worry about having to stop and recast invis, while
taking the chance that a nasty mob might spot you. When I retired the
char, I sold it to a friend.
