I second that L'Fay suggestion. I know lots of people are scared to death of
this zone; but I have leveled two druids (one completely untwinked and one
twinked out the gills) and an enchanter (untwinked) from 10-15 or so there and
it's a very nice place (i.e. quiet and uncrowded) to solo once you learn a bit
about it. First thing to know, brownies will keeeeeel you and they are tough to
see; their pathing takes them directly across the paths PCs use in several
places. Always go camo'ed to your camp; once you are there, you will be
relatively safe from brownies.  /grin  Also, since the GM event, there has been
a mob named Equestrielle the Corrupted; she's a bitch. Opens with a 410 pt. HT;
but she's a rare spawn and not up all the time. I logged my main in and offed
her if she became a problem when I leveled druid #2 there (she's lvl40 or so I
think, blue at 52). Without that option, I think maybe I'd hang it up there for
a bit if she was up and no one in zone could kill her; she tends to keep coming
back through your camp (killing you instantly every time, of course) until she
dies. Once she's down, she usually stays down for quite a while; I don't
remember ever having to kill her twice in a night.

Anyway, there are actually two bandit camps here. The sisters camp is a 4 spawn
and is a bit harder/higher level. There is also a 3 spawn over near the pixie
tower. I usually take the 3 spawn until level 13 or so, then switch to sisters.
Loot is pretty good at both camps; they drop bronze and the odd other item
(bags, packs, boxes, rations, bandages, booze, gems, etc.) I made about
80-100pp per session (couple of hours) soloing them at lvl10. As a bonus, if
you are a Tunare worshipping druid, you will probably get the opportunity to
kill a few rancorous ghasts that wander nearby from time to time and pick up a
few hearts (for a nice low-mid level druid/cleric neck quest - you need four
hearts in all.) Using harmony to break/single pull the bandits, you can have
steady exp for as long as you can handle staying there camping them.
