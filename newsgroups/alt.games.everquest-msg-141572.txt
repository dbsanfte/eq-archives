Nope, 225 is a hardcoded max for any stat in EQ. It's *very* unlikely to
change in this incarnation of EQ.

Yes, completely.

Sorry.

Absolutely NOT. 

Get AC first, with sta/hp as a secondary consideration. Ignore all other
stats (other than getting agi over 75). Once you have 1200 or so AC,
slide the focus more towards hp/sta, until you hit 1350ac, then you can
move the focus totally over to hps/sta
