Just to quibble...  My Paladin has been quite survivable dealing with
most dark blue adds since I made L45.  Root plus a mana free heal (DW
Helm is far from uber gear) and being a true plate-class go a long
ways.  But (there's always a "but") an add can turn a 5-10 minute
battle requiring only a minute or two to heal up afterwards into a
30 minute struggle followed by a ten minute recovery.  Not exactly the
epitome of "efficiency", but when your options are victory or death
(not unusual when attempting to solo in a dungeon) any sort of victory
is just fine, thank you.

Not exactly the under-10 scenario the OP mentioned, but still...
