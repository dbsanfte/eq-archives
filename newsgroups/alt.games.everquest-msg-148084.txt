This is something i've been raving on about for years. A white con (equal)
is NOT equal. They are screwing with you guys. If VI wants us to take on
tougher MOBs, they should nerf their NPCs so they become balanced!

As player characters VI have allowed to use our "brains", but the only
tactic allowed by VI is to pull when you are ready to pull, and you get to
choose the MOB (who&when). Every other tactical attack is disallowed (like
standing on locations where NPCs cant reach, using GFlux to thro MOBs into
places where they cant aggro others etc.)

With that said, it all boils down to the following :
- Does the PCs "WHO & WHEN" ability balance out with the NPCs "HP REGEN,
MANA REGEN, XTRA HP, XTRA MANA, MONK HAND2HAND ABILITY, WARRIOR AC, ENHANCED
CAST TIME & ofcourse CRAP LOOT (if they have loot at all)" ?

VI... you make me sick.
