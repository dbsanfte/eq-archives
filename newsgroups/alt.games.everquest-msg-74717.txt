Not sure why you got stupid with this guy.  It could be either/or
actually and he sure didn't get all crazy screaming about Verant
nerfing his life away.  He simply asked if others had noticed this
and suggested it may be a nerf (it could be).  Verant has many times
nerfed unannounced (not saying they did here).  Relax, it's a game.
