If you do go get those nuts, keep your eyes open for wandering bandits.

Once when I was a young and inexperienced 10th level Ranger, I heard of this
Trueshot Bow quest and begain.  Went to Freeport, went to Sister Isle,
bought nuts and Whack!  I'm dead.  Back in GFay!  Took boat to Freeport.
Got bind.  Took boat to Island.  Looted corpse and missed boat.  Got
attacked on Docs!  Back in Freeport.  Took boat, looted corpse and missed
boat again.  I finally got next boat without being attacked and made it
home.
