I have a system very similar to yours, and I can run pretty much
flawlessly with all options on and clipping plane all the way out.  My
system is an Athlon xp2000+ with 1Gig DDR ram, a GeForce 4 ti4400, and
a fast IBM Deskstar HD.  I generally turn spell effects off while I'm
raiding, just because it's too damn hard to see the mob with 100
different sparklies going off, but I have raided with them on.
If you're still having problems, I would verify that you have the
latest video drivers, and ensure that nothing else is running in the
background.
