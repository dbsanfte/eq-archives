You expected that to somehow change?

I never EVER heal someone at a druid ring (dragon ring is different) or EC
tunnel.  In most other lower level areas (1-40) if someone /yells for help I
do my DAMNEDEST to killsteal them if they have given me any evidence at all
that they expect me to PL them this cheap-assed way.  If they seem nice I'll
toss 'em a heal.  If my character can't heal I wait until they ask for help
unless they're below 20% health and the critter is still healthy.

Only pea-brains takes spawns that the player may be able to handle.
