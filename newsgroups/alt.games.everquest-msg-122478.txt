Surnames get rejected if in use on another account on that server... it's
happening to me. 2 accounts on AB... 6 chars on 1st account all have same
surname, no problems ( 1 has gotten the surname since moving from Prexus)...
3 chars on 2nd account have all had the same surname rejected :o(

Had to get a GM to fix it for y Monk... I'll just wait for the name rules to
get dropped completly before trying again :o(
