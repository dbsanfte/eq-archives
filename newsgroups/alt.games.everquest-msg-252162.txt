65 Ranger with between 270 and 305 str at all times:

My max (non-crit) hit with a Greatstaff of the Four Winds (41/31, 36
bonus at 65) is 278.  Two times 41 + 36 is 118.  My max hit is more
than doubled because of my strength stat?  The idea is that you can
use 118 as an index number.  Divide it by the weapon delay, 31, and
you can supposedly use the result to compare the weapon to other
weapons.  The actual result of the formula doesn't tell you what your
max hit will be, your minimum hit, your theoretical DPS, what price
the item will sell for in the bazaar, or whether it looks good being
held by Dark Elf.  It's just a method to index weapons' DPS.  If you
modified the formula of course, it is certainly possible to use the
original calculation to determine the actual max hit, so long as it is
true that the weapon's damage should always be weighted twice as
heavily as the bonus.

Now this brings up a different point.  I think some have claimed that
the 2D+B formula is useful only for 1h weapons.  I don't know if that
is true or not.  But if we take a look at results for 1h weapons, we
will also see that two times damage plus bonus does not come anywhere
near the max, non-crit hit for the weapon.  My Ornate Stone
Battlehammer (13/19, 13 bonus) maxes out for me at 90.  The formula
tells me my max hit should be in the area of 39.
