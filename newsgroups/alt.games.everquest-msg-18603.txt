If you're already in Vellious anyways, you can try just getting into a
group in Iceclad for the snow cougars.  There are generally folks
looking to group up there, from my experience, and at least on my server
you're *far* more likely to find a pickup group than you will in the
Kodiak caves.  And the range of levels on the cougars is something like
28 to 37 so the xp should roll in for you. Again, though, the loot sucks
abysmally unless you get freak luck and win the roll on the earrings
that drop off of *maybe* one in a hundred cougars.
