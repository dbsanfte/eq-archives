I take it that you have decided that you would prefer to wait up to 10
months if you felt that was the 'best' thing to do? Because at least for
EQ2 I would assume that December 2004 is the release date.  A bit of a
wait there. :)  

Beyond throwing that out I cannot help much.  I know lamost nothing about
WoW, and I've lost interest in EQ, so the solution for me is simple: do
something else until EQ2 is available.  I'm determined that by the time
Eq2 is out I'll have the artistic skills to draw character portraits for
friends and guildies (assuming I guild).
