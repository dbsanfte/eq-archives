I just got a new computer.  Boy was I excited. It is a 1.8G P4 on an ECS 
P4VMM2 mainboard (512M RAM).  The video is on board and is the S3 
Graphics ProSavageDDR.

EQ runs, but it looks horrible.  There seems to be some kind of issue 
with the way it is drawing layers.  For example, the names over people's 
heads are usually not there, but any part of it that has only sky in the 
background will be seen.  Any other part of the name that has any other 
thing/terrain behind it does not show up.  It is like the video system 
doesn't know to draw the name on top of the other stuff.  It is even more 
obvious when looking at my characters in the char selection screen.  
There are no facial features (which gives a really bug-eyed appearance) 
and hair only gets partially drawn and it kind of comes and goes as it 
seems to be trying to draw it on top of the head, but then it doesn't all 
get on the top layer. 

Any ideas at all?  I know some may say that I ought to just get a 
separate video card, and I intend to when the budget allows.  But for 
now, I would like to get this system to work as is.  I have a much older, 
slower computer with an Intel 810 video on the mainboard and it runs EQ 
fine.  

TIA for any help.

Robert
