}While your explanation is logical it doesn't hold in THIS situation.

Simply not true.  They are not available in the PoK library, for example.  
They didn't -used- to be available in all cleric guilds, despite what 
castersrealm said, although this may have since been rectified.  So 
finding them may have been a matter of which guild he happened to run to 
for spells.  Within the guilds that do have them, they are frequently on 
a different NPC from the other spells for that level.  specifically in 
Kaladim, that particular NPC is behind you and just out of sight around a 
corner from the other spell NPCs,and hence easily overlooked.  Making sure 
every class has at least one spell or spell line that is not in an obvious 
place or easily obtainable is one of the few parts of The Vision(tm) that 
has not yet died out.
