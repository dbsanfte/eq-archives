My interest in the game has been roused by this discussion so I
reloaded EQ, thinking I would create a new character and kill a few
rats and decaying skellies.   After four hours of downloading upgrades
and such I found myself in some sort of tutorial with golden trails
leading me from NPC to NPC.  This is one of the reasons I quit EQ2.
After getting out of the tutorial I found myself in PoK.  What?  I
never even purchased this upgrade.  All I wanted to do was create a
wood-elf ranger and work my way toward Crushbone.  Can't even do that
any more.  Bah.

I have also read about Brad's new game after hearing about it here.  It
sounds really exciting, but it's still a year away.   Bah.

Bah. Bah. Bah.  Bleh.

PD
