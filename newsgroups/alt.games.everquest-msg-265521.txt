The same could happen with any private organization that might offer up 
space for polling. Eliminating religiously-owned property from the 
available options would just be unnecessary beauracracy leading to higher 
government spending in your example. I don't feel the need to legislate 
preventative measures for every possibility of corruption in government 
when deterrant should suffice. Don't make it illegal to use churches and 
save a ton in government spending. Make political corruption a much 
riskier proposition.

Again, that's political corruption, which should carry it's own 
deterrants and consequences.

Why should they be? If they vote according to their own beliefs and 
conscience, it shouldn't be an issue.

...and that reason would be, what? I feel it is right that churches 
should not be federally funded or endorsed. However, that doesn't mean 
that the elected officials must all be athiests or agnostics. When the 
majority of our elected body holds true to a certain set of beliefs, it 
is that by which we are to be governed. If you want an athiest in office, 
vote for one. If only 2% or 5% or 10% of the nation shares your view, 
then it's not going to happen and with very good reason.

Why does it have to be an issue at all? Again, there is no endorsement 
going on here. Religion is not forced upone anyone during the polling 
process. I'm sure people could come up with some reason to be offended by 
any location selected other than government buildings. There are just not 
enough government buildings to support all of the polls.

Puh-lease. They do not, at least not in either of the two churches I've 
personally seen provide polling space. Free advertising. That's just 
silly.

It's still not being violated. There is no influence going either way 
here. You're manufacturing controversy.
