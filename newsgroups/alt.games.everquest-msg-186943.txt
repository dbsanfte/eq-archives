I'm assuming that's dripping with sarcasm :)

It got rather dull after half an hour, and after 100 black reavers we were
discussing whether we should call it a day. Until someone noticed the highest
reported was 120-something :) Personally I was wondering if the random number
generated had picked -1 spawns and we'd have to wraparound! After 150 or so we 
were considering getting one reaver for every member in the raid, but then it
stopped shortly after. I blame it on a monk that joined us right at the end;
you know who you are, harbinger of bad luck (and sanity! - cheers) ;-)

Made an 'unusual' raid at any rates. 13 jade reavers from 175 black reavers
doesn't sound like a substantially different drop rate to other long chains
I've seen posted around.

As to the cost of jade reavers in the bazaar; the market will bare what the
market will bare... If more and more people farm there then the price will
drop substantially, which can only be good for people looking for the epic
bits. (It only becomes a problem if someone wanting an epic bit finds the zone
camped by farmers, which is a far bigger problem in many other zones than
CoM.)
