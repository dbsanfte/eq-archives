In a group situation there are many situations where Paladin stuns
are very useful.  When you've got too many mobs, for whatever reason,
the fact that I can have 3 zero damage stuns plus root mem'd allows
me to help the Enchanter gain control of the situation quickly.  They
also help me to get the mobs off the Shaman (recently discovered
Shaman/Paladin duo is a wonderful thing) and root-parked when I'm
doing crowd-control, stuns are good for gaining agro even on mobs
that are immune to stun.  Since the resist change patch I've found
that stunning wiz-, necro-, and druid-type casters cuts way down on
damage taken, worth lots more than the same mana spent on healing
would be.  And when you really, really need to keep that wiz-type
mob from killing somebody because the healer and the nuker are oom
(or LD, or <still> AFK, or just plain stupid and you're just trying
to survive the fight so you can leave the group in one piece) chain
stunning works quite well.  Oh, and when somebody makes a mistake and
roots a fleeing Gate caster you have to stun it until it's dead as it
will try to cast Gate until it succeeds or it dies, at least that's
been my experience.
