I don't think your doing anything wrong, it's simply that when you send
your pet to attack another, they have to fight a bit to agro the other
ones (It may be because the thing attacking your pet doesn't hit your
pet right away, so the others don't agro). You just have to circle
around once to get them back on, annoying sure, but it still works.
