Go watch the EQ chat when a server locks up.

Okay, cheap, bad entertainment.  But hey, it's almost better than
watching FOX network. :D

ATM I see all kinds of spastic spittle being spouted about the law
stating they're entitled to their monthly fees back for any downtime
whatsoever, and they're going to quit forever, and DAOC is so much
better, and when's the server gonna be up again goddammit they were in
UP and were rocking when all this happened and they'd better get a GM
rez goddammit and first because they were rocking goddammit.

Ryou
(was just buying her level 24 spells so... wants a full GM rez,
goddammit!)
