Does it under the new DoT stacking?  I've not really delved into how
DoTs cast by different players interact, but I do know that the last
time I played my Druid <all> of his DoTs stacked, even those of the
same line (i.e. Flame Lick stacked with Immolate and Creeping Crud
stacked with Stinging Swarm).  The way SOE originally said DoT stacking
was going to work was that different players could cast the same DoT
and have it stick, but not different DoTs of the same line (where the
higher level spell had always overwritten the lower level spell in the
past).  Obviously that's not the way they implemented it.

You've done some multi-Necro grouping, right?  So how does the multi-
player DoT stacking work out?
