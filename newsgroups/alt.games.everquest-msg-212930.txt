I agree and dissagree...  if I don't own the account then why can't you log
on to my account, or why can't Sony sell abadoned accounts?  Ok, if I
conceed that Sony is only actually "leasing" the account to me what about
what is contained on the account?  Meaning the characters, gear, plat, level
of characters, etc... which are totally a result of my efforts.  If I should
decide, for whatever reason, this has value and decide to part with it then
there should be a mechenisim in place to make this possible only because of
the fact that I payed and toiled to produce it.  Can't you agree that the
characters created and develouped on an account are the "property" of the
account holder?  Won't you conceed that some mechanism should/could be put
in place to allow account holders to receive some small reemburseemnt for
their envestment should they decide that is what they want/have to do?

Hell, I'd even be in favor of a plan where the account holder petitioned
Sony to dispose of such account content for perhaps a set amount depentent
on level...  perhaps Lvl 30 to 39 = $10; Lvl 40 to 49 = $20; Lvl 50 to 59 =
$30; Lvl 60+ = $35 per character contained on an account (if fully geared
maybe) even if Sony sold it for a profit themselves or held them for some
future use or whatever they decided to do with them.  There are people who
play that don't have the time to invest more that a few hours a week into
develouping a character and are never able to take advantage of many of the
games features/Zones etc....  Maybe sell ONE returned character and one only
to an account holder just so such people could take advantage of more of
what the game offers and require the name be changed too.

Even though I can put in 100 to 120 hours a month playing and have numberous
50+ tweeked characters on both of my accounts I wouldn't begruge others the
enjoyment from being able to go everywhere I can and participate in
activites I do.  I'm sure this dosn't make sense to many but it is my
opinion and that I do own, preceeved right or wrong by others, its mine!
