> Could someone give me a list of spells to have memmed for a 39th lvl Ranger?

Depends entirely what you are fighting - and what you have access to in
the form of Luclin and PoP spells.

For me I keep my best healing spell in slot 8
I also always have snare and root memmed. 
Typically I pretty much always have carelss lightning and Flame lick in
the mix too.

That leaves me 3 spell slots to focus on a particular enemy type or for
whatever Im doing at the moment.

I cycle all my buffs through there, Skin, Coat, Riftwind, Str and Agi
buffs, SoW, Call of sky and Precision to maintain that spread of spells on
me at all times. How many slots I use for this cycle is highly dependant
on what Im doing. Spike Shield is often in there as a cast now buff.

I also use these three slots t take target specific spells, eg panic
animal, Anti-summoned DD spells etc. 

If I happen to be needed a DoT then Stinging swarm goes in there, if the
mob can interrupt easily then tangling weeds is an option.
