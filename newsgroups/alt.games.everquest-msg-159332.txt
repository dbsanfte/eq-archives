I was about to say something about there being a fine line between
bravery and stupidity.  But in this case, it's more of a Great Wall of
China than a fine line.

At the time I think we had two level 60's with us. (We now have a grand
total of about a dozen, though they are rarely all online at the same
time.) Primal? We're a wee bit short on that at the moment. I think the
total number of people we have with primal is.... ummmm..

/em stops to count on his fingers and toes

ummm.... zero.

> How close did you guys get?   

Several of us got within melee range briefly. BUA HA HA

If you mean healthwise? Might have gotten him as low as 95%. ;-)

> Do your guildies all have a right clicky?

Doubtful, and since I don't know why you're asking, I'm not sure if it
would do any good if we did. I do, of course, but it depends which sort.
I have j-boots for a self buff right clicky if needed, and my SoTF to
right clicky the bad guys. Most of our folks, I'd say no.

Ummm.... we didn't really have one. Were only going to kill the minis
and were more shocked than anyone else to suddenly find him there.

Oh, I've read about the loot. He's on our "someday" list, but I think we
need to worry about being able to kill Trakenon and Vindi first. (Still
zero for whatever on both.) Plus, we only need the Spiroc Wing blade for
our first pair of light sabers in the guild, so I think our next big
window of raid opportunity is going to be spent up in good old PoS.
*sigh*.

/em goes and loads up on air stones from the guild bank *again*.

The loot for wizards in PoS is complete, ass. You know that don't you?
And I don't mean complete ass for an uber. I mean complete ass for
somebody that can even fight in Kael arena. Wizard only items with
negative INT on them. What *will* they think of next?
