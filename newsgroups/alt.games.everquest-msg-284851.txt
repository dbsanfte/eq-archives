I don't *think* Beal was arguing that audio triggers have little use.
He said "along these lines", which I took to mean "audio triggers as
they pertain to spell-casting messages".

I have about 20 audio triggers per character at this point (most of
them custom .wav files where I've mixed one of the default sounds
with myself saying things like "gate", "rage", "lost follow", etc.)
and continue to think of more.

Most recently I added "out" as a trigger on "Insufficient Mana",
"Insufficient Endurance", and "You don't have everything you need
for this recipe".  You might think the last one is easy enough to
notice on the screen, but when I'm doing long tradeskill sessions
I'm usually alternating between clicking on "Combine" and typing my
autoinventory hotkey while reading a book. :-)

I sometimes wonder how many audio triggers I can have before it
starts to have a noticeable effect on my client, which is presumably
checking each of my triggers against every line in my chat windows.
(There are ways to pre-process the list of triggers so that the code
could check for all of them at once, but I'll bet they don't.)
