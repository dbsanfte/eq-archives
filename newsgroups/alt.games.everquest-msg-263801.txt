Actually, I don't believe it is the original request that has caused so 
much furor here, it is the followups, much the same can be said for your 
newsgroup.  From our point of view, having seen just this exchange here, 
and having nothing else to judge most of you (that are posting from other 
newsgroups) by, things appear quite different.  Again, I am sure the same 
can be said for you.
