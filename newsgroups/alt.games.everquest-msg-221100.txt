Finished another LDoN last night, very close to leveling but
people had to log so we couldn't stay and clear the rest of the
place out.

After doing the split and so forth, I decided to go back to OT
and get the remaining 2% just to finish up before going to bed.

Zone in, invis up, and start jogging over to the ramp, same as
I've done a hundred times since leaving Paladul.  Suddenly out at
the far reaches of my clip plane I see red shirts with silver
helms.. uh oh.  I swerve right and try to move out of the path,
but no luck, the General and at least three Goons all manage to
spot me and given that they move faster than many bards, are on
me like white on rice in a heartbeat.

I don't mind eating a death here or there, my complaint is that I
was about to level... and I don't think there's any time I die
more than when I'm either about to level, or when I only recently
have leveled.

The latter you could put down to trying out new spells or
something... but the former?

I blame SOE, they must have something in the mob AI that detects
nearly full exp bars!

And they said the vision was dead.
