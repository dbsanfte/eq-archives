4 levels wouldn't make that much of a difference.  Per the thread on the 
stress test beta, Blizzard specifically quotes this example:

"Players are free to help kill the tagged monster, but they will receive no 
experience or loot from the kill. Even with help, the player or group who 
initially tapped the monster will gain full experience from the kill. In 
situations where a much higher level player helped with the kill, some of 
the experience reward will be reduced.

Example 1 : Level 10 player attacks level 10 monster, level 10 player 
helps - Player A gets full experience
Example 2 : Level 10 player attacks level 10 monster, level 30 player 
helps - Player A gets reduced xp"

So they do indicate that yes, you will get reduced XP with 
anti-powerleveling code.  But it wouldn't eliminate the XP entirely as you 
observed in that case.  I too have seen this, and I'm pretty certain in my 
case it was due to lag.
