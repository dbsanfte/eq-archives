I think he meant he didn't have anywhere else to hunt BUT the dwarves,
because Kunark wasn't released yet.

It was a common problem. There were even regular groups killing Den,
Lann, Tagnis, and that other one back then, not just quad kiters.

The only alternatives were SolB and LG (few people knew enough about
kedge to go) and they were bloated way beyond full.
