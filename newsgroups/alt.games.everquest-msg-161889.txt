On a similar note, I played my 55 cleric in a group without my rogue
or another alt for the first time in 30 levels. I always assumed I
would be an awful cleric because Sheava's been more of a tool than a
character. But, today, I took a group of level 51 and 52 OS virgins
and held NG for about 5 hours without a hitch, including saving an AE
group from a TPW and giving out plenty of free rezzes to random dead
people who got killed in Discos and Crypt. Nobody in my group died.
Nobody even came close. And, I actually enjoyed playing the cleric.

I know that it's entirely the other end of the 50+ game, but it felt
*good*.
