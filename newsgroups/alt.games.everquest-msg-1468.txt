Really?  A very good friend of mine in game is a 51 gnome enchanter.  I've
seen several others.

Both Cha and Int are important, not sure about the balance though. 
Personally I'd put in all to int, with th remainder to cha, but I could
DEFINITELY be wrong there...

Just as a note, Enchanters can be one of the most difficult classes to play. 
If you don't group to exp, there *will* be plenty you miss out on.

: Can tinkering bring at least enough profit to pay for itself?

Not really, no.  Used to be able to when Fishbone earrings went for 6k+, now
that they are half of that, no one wants aqualungs anymore.
