Update from those wonderful folks at VI on the questions we've posed
here since the patch message came out. The Ragefire loot table will
*NOT* be nerfed down to just drop the heart. (sigh)  If you can possibly
believe this, the reason Alan gave was, (not quoting directly here.. too
lazy)

[paraphrased] ..if we didn't have the good loot for other people to have
a chance at, they might be less likely to come help you finish your
epic. [/paraphrase]

I wrote a feedback immediately. Of course it won't get published,
because I unfortunately started it with, "Alan, do you even PLAY this
game???"

Basically I pointed out that nobody without a guild is going to get a
click stick. Any guild with clerics will basically cut off their left
arm to get them equipped with clicksticks, loot or no fucking loot. So
that reason for leaving the loot *IN* is total crap. However, a full
Naggy loot table on a dragon that pops every few days and doesn't even
need a pearl to spawn, is going to be permacamped. So the reason to nerf
the loot table is *IMMENSE*. Alan's responce was that they would be
"keeping an eye on it."

Sorry, Clerics. What looked to be a huge boon may turn into you being
fucked worse than you were before.

Oh, and the idea of making the heart no-rent was also suggested in that
post. Alan dismissed it out of hand citing concerns of "what if the
cleric goes LD?"

WTF is up with Alan? As I asked, does he even PLAY this game? What kind
of answer is that? What if the cleric went LD in Sol B during the Zord
fight under the old system after the pearl was turned in? Still fucked.
I dont' understand this shit at all.
