Hmm, you're probably right. Oh well, the buzz was nice while it lasted.
Still, I'm going to play my ranger differently from now on. I used to play
him as a half autistic wolfman (doesn't talk to people much, growls often).

wise beyond all, brave beyond belief and serene at all times hero he
deserves to be. And just when the eq flame was dwindling a bit. Woohoo, I'm
hooked again. Screw the real world, plug me in and don't forget to change my
