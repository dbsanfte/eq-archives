Why is it that every time I'm of a high enough level to complete a quest for
weapons or armor, whatever I'm earning is sooooooooo not effective anymore?
Ex: killed Ghoul Messenger (Dark Blue and a close battle at 34), got Map of
Kithicor, go to get Short Sword of Morin, and it's like 6/22 WTF good is
that to me at this level? And it's NODROP too? Are there any attainable
quests out there that are actually worth my while?
