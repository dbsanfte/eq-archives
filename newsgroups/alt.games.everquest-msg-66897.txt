strategy.  my main is a cleric.  a cleric at higher levels has to know his
party well and heal accordingly.  at level 30, 40, etc clerics use pretty
much the same heal on everyone... gheal or sheal.  in seb, when mobs are
nailing my chanter for 170 and i try to do anything other than remedy, she
is a goner.  also, allowing my tanks to drop down to bezerker so they can
get those kick ass discs off and still land  a ch  just before death is a
rush.  CR's are a lot more complex too. if my party dies deep down in the
hole we can send in the rogues to see if they can get the bodies... if not
we gotta summon corpses up.... i could on forever, but these are some of the
cooler things you see in the high lvl game.  at 35, if you die in solb...
you run to get your corpse. not a lot of strategy and fun behind that.  oh
and you'll never see "CLERICS CAMP, CLERICS CAMP" in lguk =)  what a rush =)
Or dragon raids.. there is nothing like watching your whold guild engage a
dragon, 5 seconds later see all of them with [LD] tags come running right
back lol (area fear).  Just lots of cool stuff after or around 50.
