Lokari, that was exactly my point later on in the same message, which
you snipped.

Why take away something that  the folks are used to, that NOBODY
was unhappy with?  If VI was getting emails about "Stop making me
see all those numbers, d00d....they make my head hurt" I'd understand.
Taking the numbers away (for what I've said sounds like a completely
bogus and silly reason...competitors want to steal your server numbers?
sheesh....) will piss some folks off, while leaving them up won't piss
anybody off. At all.
