I have no idea which MMOG he's referring to.

You can apparantly guess, but since I haven't been paying attention to 
Beta testing details, I really have no clue, and didn't get one from his 
post.

So I'd guess he's pretty safe.

BUT if he posted the same message on whatever board you are talking 
about, that would be a much better clue
