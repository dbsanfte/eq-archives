I don't see anything wrong with that.  If people decide to pay you, then
you've made some plat and they're happy for the service.  The only thing I
can think of is why?  Why would you go into a fantasy roleplaying game and
decide to create a customer-service job for yourself?  What, you're really a
barbarian warrior in real life and you just have to get away from all that
by roleplaying a CSR?  ; )

OK, but you can open a few windows and to allakhazam and others to get an
average, I guess.

Nope, guildies will usually chime in if I ask.
