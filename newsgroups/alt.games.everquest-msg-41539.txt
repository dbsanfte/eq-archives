Yes, and we have treaties for that. Among the signatories are Britain, 
France, Germany, Italy among others. Here is my point: Why is the United 
States the only one the world holds responsible to prevent things like 
this from occurring? Why don't these other countries step up and do 
their part? BTW in 1914 nationalism started a war also that resulted in 
unimaginable casualties.. perhaps we could learn something here. I may 
have alluded that I was an isolationist.. I'm definitely NOT. I do NOT 
believe the US should meddle in every single dispute on the planet. I do 
believe we should fully guard our interests and yes, go to war if 
necessary to defend them. But I do think the other powers in the world 
should step up more and do their part. Maybe then those responsible will 
think about their actions and worry just a bit about what the WORLD will 
think of them when they do it.
