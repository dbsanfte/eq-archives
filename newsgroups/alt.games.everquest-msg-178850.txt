I was comparing an animation with full druid buffs, including the high
end damage shield, to a charmed pet with none at all, with OT level
(and similar) mobs. Obviously when things are equal, a charmed pet
does more than the animation, and in higher level zones, the mobs will
do damage faster. Duh. :-p The animation was actually killing the ones
that don't run away *faster*. But as I said, if this was applied
equally to a charmed pet, I would expect considerably faster exp, at
the cost of a great deal of safety, not being able to watch the
enchanter's screen while pulling.

I'm not worried about my druid ever being in danger. What I am worried
about is the mob breaking charm while I'm pulling. Enchanters don't
last long when they are being hit by something while they are for all
intents and purposes *afk*. :-p I'm afraid I might spend the whole
time switching between windows in worry.
