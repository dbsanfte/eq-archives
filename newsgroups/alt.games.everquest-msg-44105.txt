Unfortunately I don't think it's totally Verant's fault.  I have a SB
live card also.  I have noticed similar things.  I usually have to turn
my sound off (fortunately i run my sound through my stereo, so i just
turn my stereo off), if waiting for the boat in East Freeport, because
the surf sound is so loud it hurts your ears, at the normal volume for
hearing other noises in the game.  I think a good portion of the problem
lies in the fact that Creative has for all practical purposes stopped
supporting the sound card it's mass producing.  Last driver update was
in 1999.  It's now 2001.  Creative needs to write some new drivers, and
maybe implement support for dx8, since that didn't exist at the time of
the last driver update.  I am not holding my breath though.  I think my
SB live is the last product I will purchsase from Creative.  Their
driver support has fallen to nil on many of their products over time,
and not when the item is no longer "cutting edge" or whatever.  SB live
is a great sound card, it's a shame they stopped supporting them.
