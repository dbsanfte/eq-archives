Other people have probably given you better ideas about the best place to
go, but currently in Lguk myself I thought I'd say a few things about it.
Number one, you will probably find it difficult to solo anywhere past the
BR, which would be too low for you as well.  You might be able to ITU to
safe hall or something and try pulling one or two at a time from there, and
might work OK, so long as you don't get a wizard.  However, it would still
be risky and I probably wouldn't recommend it.  The best advice is find a
group in Lguk.  The exp is great (I can do a level in about 6 hours), loot
is good (many times our whole group was so full we just started throwing the
FS away), and Clerics and Paladins rock in that place.  It is also good if
you have never experienced dungeons much, and will start to help you
understand dungeon grouping, pathing, pulling, add-handling techniques etc.
for when you start going into higher level dungeons and raids.

For this reason I also recommend a group, as that is what a cleric is most
needed for on raids - looking after the well-being of the group, and a
cleric that doesn't know how to do this in such a situation won't be highl
sought after.  But up to you, sure, not going to dungeons now doesn't mean
you won't be any good at them later.  But I am finding that there are many
players out there that have spent their entire lives in outdoor zones, that
they come into a indoor one and just have no idea how to operate.
