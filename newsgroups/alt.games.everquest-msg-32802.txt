Woot, after 3 really interesting days of killing Ghasts in LFay, i
finally managed to get my Warden Symbol of Tunare.

Its druid/cleric only, Tunare worshippers only. AC 7, Wis 3, Cha 2, Mana
15, and with the Effect Grasping Roots.
Nodrop of course, but definitely worth the struggle to get it.

Started out by spending 1 hour in LFay getting all i needed for the
second of the 3 quests, then spending 3 RL days on getting the damn 4
ghasts hearts. Try imagining a mob that only spawn at night, is rare
spawn with undeads as PHs, and you need 4 rare drops. REALLY funny. Well
at least i got 1 blue bub of XP on level 35 from Thistle Underbrush, who
con green to me (try imagining how many times you need to kill a green
mob to get 1 blue bub of XP on a hell level), and got 5 Braided Ivy
Cords, that helped a little.

Then joined a raid on Mistmoore to get a nodrop item from there. Tried
to go in there alone, at level 35 its IMPOSSIBLE to solo in that place.
But got the item there, and the rest of the quest was a piece of cake,
and now im the proud owner of the Warden Symbol of Tunare


Its just SOOO nice to be able to cast a manaless root, even if it take 5
sec to cast. It even do 10 dmg, so can kill mobs with it, killed a Orc
Centurion in GFay with it.

Can clearly reccomend for all you wood elf druids out there to do that
quest. Heres a great link about it:
