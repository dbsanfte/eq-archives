    Nothing. But the item goes poof and doesn't enter the skeleton's
inventory - it won't be there when you kill it. Quest items are coded a
little differently - if you give an NPC an item he needs for a quest, he
eats it whether it's No Drop or not. I can remember at least one quest where
what to hand in was figured out by handing the NPC a number of droppable
items from the zone, then killing the NPC to see what stuff went poof.

    Heh, you might be surprised. 8) There have been MANY No Drop transfer
bugs in EQ's history. For example, they never thought people would put No
Drop items in a forge or other tradeskill container and leave them there for
the next person.
