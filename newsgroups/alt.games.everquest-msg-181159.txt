}Heh. I just love people like you in the bazaar. Makes it SO much easier to

Boy are you missing a trick.  Get a second account, put a mule on it with 
substantially the same stock, and over price it, then undercut yourself at 
slightly-above-market... And as you sell your 'cheap' wares, just tool the 
mule over and restock yerself. :)
