Quite true. Since my acquaintances all consider me some kind of
computer expert (which isn't strictly true, and even if it were I'd
put great effort into discouraging that impression!) I often get asked
questions like "I want to get a computer, what kind should I get". Hit
them with the question "What do you want to do with it", and their
answer often leads me to recommend they get a calculator and a pad of
paper instead.

>much better than a Packard Bell 486.

Ack! Any time I see Packard Hell on the chassis, my first
recommendation is to throw it away!
