I agree with the STA comment to a point. STA is the hardest stat to 
raise... but overall it doesn't matter a dang bit where your starting 
stats are really. Putting them all into WIS would be a waste but 
wouldn't really affect you're effectiveness in the big scheme. EQ is one 
game where you simply can't really gimp a character.

Ditto for Agnostic. It won't save you much grief at all... a little 
greif maybe. But its a small challenge that's easy to overcome (or 
simply avoid), and it adds a little flavour to your character in a world 
of agnostic enchanters. Theres no real advantage to selecting a god... 
but there really isn't much of a of real disadvantage either.
