> 3. Feign Death (level 16)

> Your role as a snarer
> This is a simple but key role. Snaring a mob that runs is important
> because otherwise it will wander and give you adds. Dooming darkness

> from a rooted mob is much more desirable than having a train pound
> your ass.
>
> Necro Cleric
> Necros make very good and mana efficient healers. Very few people know
> just how good of a healer a necro can be. However, we really start
> shining as a cleric once we obtain the spell Pact of Shadow. This
> works as a heal over time that drains away your HP and transfers it to
> your target. Couple this with your lifetap DoT that you can use at
> your current level and you become a monster healer while doing damage
> at the same time.
>
> The key point in using this line of spell is to pact early, even
> before the person you pact on may not need a heal right away. For
> example, as soon as something is pulled, you want to pact the main
> tank right away, even if he/she is at full HP, because they won't be
> for long. As they take damage, the tick goes off and they get healed.
> It may be difficult to keep a tank at full HP at all times, but you
> can for sure keep them at a managable level.
>
> To compensate for your HP loss, Use your lifetap DoT when needed. This
> is where practicing a bit before you actually need to use it is
> important. You must get an idea of how much HP loss you sustain, while
> how much the target is healed. Also, know around when you should cast
> your lifetaps.
>
> Necro Chanter
> This is where Screaming Terror comes into play. Screaming Terror is a
> 18 second stun/mezz. Meaning it mezzes the target for 18 seconds or
> until someone breaks it like someone breaks a mez. It has a refresh
> time of a few seconds. If you are the chanter for your group, have
> this memmed as well as a form of root that you can use or are
> comfortable with.
>
> If you have adds, target the add and cast ST. Proceed this by casting
> root, to keep the target in place once the 18 seconds are up. This
> works well if its a melee type. This is called root/parking.
>
> If the add is a caster, it is important that you keep it mezzed at all
> times. If you are in such a situation, as soon as ST repops, cast it
> again, even if it is not close to 18 seconds from the last time you
> cast it. The reason for chain casting is because you will get resists.
> Casting ST again on the mob as soon as it refreshes gives you once
> more chance to cast it again if you get a resist before the 18 second
> timer is up.
>
> With the given refresh time, and no resists, it is possible to keep 2
> things mezzed at all times. With resists, you will take some hits, so
> make sure you get buffs accordingly. Couple ST w/ root parking, you
> can become one effective crowd controller.
>
> Necor puller
> Yes, necros can make great pullers too. FD and a pulling spell is key
> for this role. A good pulling spell could be anything. A snare, your
> level one lifetap (very fast cast time, and low mana cost), or a
> debuff. Choosing the right one depends on what you are gonna pull.
>
> Choose your mob, pull it using your pulling spell, and run back to
> your camp. Sound simple enough?
>
> Of course its not that simple in some situations. When it comes time
> to split pull some mobs then it gets a bit tricky. There are a couple
> of ways to do this. First way is to snare the mob that you want to
> pull, run out away from their spawn point a bit, then FD. The adds
> will walk back to their spawn point, but the one you snared will
> remain there until snare wears off. Do not get up until the other mobs
> are back at their spawn point because otherwise they will remember you
> (if you are above level 34). Once they are back, aggro should be clear
> on those adds but the one you wanted to pull should still be aggroed
> on you and you can then proceed to your camp to kill it. You may have
> to play with this a bit because if the snared mob is too close to the
> others, they might re-aggro and you will need to FD again. Patience is
> important here.
>
> The second way is a bit more tricky and there is more luck involved.
> This method uses ST. ST the mob you DON'T want to pull (if there it is
> a 2 spawn camp). Hopefully the one you do want will come charging.
> Wehn ST wears off, it might forget about you. Using these methods you
> can effectively split pull your way to a nice and easy exp grind
> session.
>
> Necro Buffer/Debuffer
>
> With the advent of Luclin, We can now be pretty good buffers. This
> role is pretty simple. Once a mob is pulled, use your luclin taps to
> buff your party.
>
> Necro Damager
>
> This role is self explanitory. Necros are damage dealers. There are
> many ways we can deal damage. First thing to know is that your pet is
> your most mana efficient DoT. The longer you fight with it, the more
> efficient the mana used compared with the damage done by the pet
> becomes. If you are in a fast killing group, this may be the only form
> of damage that would be necessary. In other groups, picking the right
> DoT is important. Usually the Poison ones are good for the fast action
> DoT's. Other one to use is the Heart Flutter line. These spells have
> the unfortunate side effect of high aggro. I will explain how you can
> deal with that later. The key thing to understand is gettin a feel for
> how long it takes to kill a mob, and picking the the DoT accordingly,
> so that you don't waste mana on DoT's that take WAY too long to do a
> good amount of damage. This just takes some practice.
>
> Necro Tank
>
> Yes, Necros can make ok tanks, but only after 54. Deflux/Bond of
> Death/Heartflutter are you spell choices here. Get your HP/AC buffs.
> When a mob comes, cast Heart flutter to get aggro (This line has some
> nasty aggro on it), cast Bond of Death, and chain cast deflux. Works
> pretty well. Works better if the mob is slowed :).
>
> Other key notes
>
> Here is a list of other random notes to take into consideration:
>
> 1. Notice how I didn't list Mana battery as a role? There is a reason
> for this, and it is a simple one....it is NOT a role. Twitchin is a
> tool that should rarely be needed. If the cleric is running low on
> mana, play the necro cleric role. If the chanter asks for mana, play
> the necro chanter role. The ONLY time you should have to twitch is if
> you are in those places where you just can't keep the tank healed
> enough or your mez won't land (like in some ssra temple camps).
>
> 2. Playing your necro to its fullest will get you aggro eventually. FD
> works great in this situation. FD can be considered as an evade, much
> like the rogue evad or the ranger jolt. If you get aggro, FD, and if
> successful, you will be lower on the hate list once you get up.
> If you still are gettin pummeled, HS/QVoX yourself and wait till FD
> refreshes.
>
> 3. As a necro, you must be able to forsee a wipeout when it happens.
> You can do a few things in this situation. Either sacrfice yourself to
> give the cleric time to get away, or FD and wait for things to settle
> down. If you choose to FD, get consent and drag the corpses to a
> nearby cleric, or a safe point for recovery.
>
> 4. A pre-nerfed Circlet of Shadows is a nifty item to have. Get one if
> you can. It will greaty enhance your role as a necro puller, and help
> greatly during a wipeout. Why do you think rogues and monks make great
> draggers? The rogue can instant inviz without fear of it dropping and
> the monk is able to FD pull. With the pre-nerfed CoS, you can do both.
>
> 5. It is possible to play ALL these roles at the same time. You can be
> the cleric/chanter/puller/snarer/damager/buffer all at the same time
> if you play around with your spells.
>
> 6. Even if there is a cleric, or a chanter, or a shaman in the group
> that can do what you can do but better, play the backup role. It is
> important to be prepared for the worst. If the chanter dies on a pull,
> be ready to crowd control. Likewise with the cleric. You can save a
> lot of wipeouts if you are prepared.
>
>
> 7. The most important thing to understand is to know what your group
> is capable of. Necros are masters of efficiency. When we solo, we do
> it efficiently. We kill stuff and move on to the next without wasting
> time. Use this attribute in the group. Know what the group is lacking
> and compensate. Necros can't do any one thing perfectly, but we can do
> just about everything pretty damn well enough to make sure the group
> runs at its most efficient level. And realize this, an efficient,
> non-stop-carnage group = more exp for you :).
>
>
> There may be more to grouping then what I have listed. However, I hope
> those of you that feel like they aren't good in groups will now learn
> just what a necro is capable of. I also hope that you dispell the
> rumors and beliefs that other classes have about necros and groups.
> Knowing what to do in groups as well as knowing how to solo will make
> your EQ experience and your necro experience a much more enjoyable
> one. Happy hunting.
