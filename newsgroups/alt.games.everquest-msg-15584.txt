There is no "Best" class/race. There is only the "Best" class/race for
you. You have to decide what you like. The Ranger class is one of the
most challenging in the game.

The diseased Wolf Pelt and Bear pelt looted in Qeynos Hills are part
of a quest. You give them to Preistess Caluria inside the Temple of
Life (Flying Saucer in Qeynos). Great quest. The Bear pelts give
fantastic exp levels 9-12, and 1.5-2.5 in plat.

Cheers
