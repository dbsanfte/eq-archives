Addenum because I'm stupid in the mornings.

Yes the proc is self only. So it owuld constantly remove the pets buffs. 
I was just thinking of an alternative way to be irritating to the 
beastlord in question. If you want to practice your weapon skills just 
find a high level beastlord, get him to activate pet hold, duel him and 
go to town. Make sure you're behind the pet, thos level 64 pets can 
riposte fairly nasty, especially if yuo're a low level
