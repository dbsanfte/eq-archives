From personal experience (No pun intended), different kinds of mobs
give different experience. For example, that DB Elysian I was pulling
gave a LOT better experience that the DB Hill Giant. Or than the DB
Bulthar. And Named might just give bonuses as well... Can't tell for
sure... But I'd bet platinum that mobs with extra abilities give exp
bonuses, and of course you get bonuses in certain dungeons... It's not
a straightforward affair at all...

But this is just the feelings I get from playing for almost 3 years...
I could be full of crap. :)
