Nice try...nooooo it was about the time he (StanMann) took his and Morley's
exchange to alt.2600 that I got severely pissed off.  It was all good fun
until then, hell and I was even *with* StanMann showing the mouth a thing or
two until we went to 2600.

That was just lame, especially after bleeding the guys personal info.

What then Dan, do you suppose StanMann's reasons were for cross-posting that
over to 2600?  That was all okay with you?
