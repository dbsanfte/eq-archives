}> }I know.  That makes it *so* much easier.  Well, for the only real class 
}> }in EQ, anyway ;)
}> What do you mean?  Chanters don't get Sneak/Hide... :)
}Right, right. Go sit over there with the casters, *they* like you. ;)

/em cries softly.

}> Lozani will be happy to take any illegible scrolls and cantrips you may 
}> have. :)  Fairly rare spawn in the bar.  After 6pm though, watch out for 
}> Lenka Stoutheart and her ogre chum.  They like Dark Elf pate`. :)
}I seriously doubt he'll ever be in the mood to take anything from me :)

Sneak/Hide?
 
}especially since again, I couldn't find any faction info on him.  And 
}yes, those two were the ones whom I was smart enough to con first.

Heheh, I've had then charge up to the door and pound me when I was barely 
in the room.  Think they're on Halas factions, so there isn't much you can 
do about it.

}> They're in the 1-2gp range from a merchant last I checked.  You may need 
}> about a hundred of them... about 40 per faction level, as I recall.
}Ah so just slightly more expensive than muffins.  Good, good.  Soon, ALL 
}WILL LOVE ME!  Of course, how can they not?

You'll have to ask Lenka that one. :)

}> There's some variation, yep.  The pawn pick quest raises most of the 
}> relevant factions... Can't remember for sure on the ones you specify, I 
}> think those may actually be the exceptions.  But EFP is much easier for 
}> kiola sap making anyway.  I think the ones in the port authority building 
}> may be beta neutral or something.  The bank ho is probably knights of 
}> truth.  But she's a greedy wench anyway, so heck with her. :)
}EFP is a longer run for water though.  I really *hate* the way they set 
}up water sales in Freeport, btw.

Bah, it's not like you have to zone or anything.  Just buy all your water 
first.

}"Tradeskill Central" my ass.  Is 
}Shadowhaven any better?  Assuming I take the time to do whatever the 
}heck quest it is that makes the sellers there all happy happy with you?

Well... as I recall, there's no kiola sap merchant, which is rawther 
inconvenient.  I usually did all of mine right there in EFP (my main 
tailor is a DE Wiz of Inny, btw).  It's actually pretty convenient, since 
the loom and pattern merchant is only a building or so away from Trader's 
Holiday.  And then if I get bored of tailoring, there's smithing supplies 
local too.
