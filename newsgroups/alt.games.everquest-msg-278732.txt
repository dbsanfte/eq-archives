For fun, I'm trying to raise faction by using the Exterminator quests.  I'm 
non-KOS to half the guards and the shopkeepers, but KOS to everyone else.  I 
did several turn-ins, but didn't seem to make much leeway.

Does anyone have any direct experience with how good the Exterminator quests 
are at raising faction?  Are we talking hundreds of turn-ins?  Thousands?

Thanks.
