 Ran from Thurgadin to get my corpse from FV, yes forgot to bind in FV and
then ran past Vekis (<<

could you post the zones? I'm not familiar with that part of the world.

I was thinking of this: bound in Ak'Anon, corpse in Permafrost Keep

Ak'Anon

Lesser Faydark
Greater Faydark
Butcherblock Mtns
(get on boat)
Ocean of Tears
(get off boat)
East Freeport
West Freeport
East Commanlands
West Commonlands
Kithicor Forest
Highpass Hold
Eastern Karanas
Northern Karanas
Western Karanas
Qeynos Hills
Blackburrow
Everfrost Peaks
Permafrost Keep

haven't done it personally, but I almost came close.
