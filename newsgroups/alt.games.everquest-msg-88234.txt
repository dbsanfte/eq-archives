Lemme tell you from personal experience...

A friend and I were camping the undead monolith in Nek.  We were lowbie DE's
and were getting xp from the kills.

A guy came through who was higher level than us and began pulling left and
right and stealing everything from the spawn.  Even the things we were
getting ready to pull...

We petitioned because in our way of thinking, the other undead spawn point
was uncamped and he could have just as easily moved on to that one.

We had asked him nicely several times and he told us that all we were doing
was sitting there.  We weren't killing so therefore he had every right to
kill whatever he wanted.

I explained that we were medding and getting ready and blah blah but he then
became even more aggressive with taking the spawns.

We petitioned him and the GM came along and told us that as long as we were
not actively engaged in killing a mob, he was free to pull whatever he
wanted.

So, there ya go.  You were not kill stealing or camp stealing or anything.
Too bad for them that they were medding or waiting for healer or whatever.
If they were not actively engaged in battle then you stole nothing.

I personally always try to ask first to see if the group there wouldn't mind
sharing a spawn while they med, but a lot of people don't and there is
nothing a GM will do about it.
