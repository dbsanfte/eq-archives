I'm glad (in that misery loves company kind of way) that someone else had
similar issues.  At one point, EQ became totally non-responsive for what
seemed like several minutes, then the screen went black I was back at the
account login screen (fortunately I was in PoK at the time).  I was
two-boxing, but the other session (on the same internet connection) was fine
(and the indicators on each session had never been other than green).  One
thing I had noted was a lot of lag when other characters were in my view.

I logged back in with the first session and went trampling around Marus Seru
and here's what happened.  As I was entering the zone from the Neth. Lair
area, there were about five or six people in the round building standing in
a circle getting buffed.  Once they entered my view the lag was horrible.
They were directly in the path to the entrance/exit to the building and when
I pressed the arrow key to go left or right around them nothing happened for
several seconds, then suddenly I went way left or right.  I got past them
and went into Marus, hunted for a couple of minutes and got one too many
stonegrabber adds.  I made a quick dash for the Neth. zone, no problem, but
the six people are still standing in that round buildiing near the entrance
buffing up.  Again my session became unresponsive once they entered my
view - I held down the movement keys for several seconds and nothing seems
to be happening, then suddenly that right or left movement that I had tried
15 seconds ago kicked in.  It was so bad that standing just a little to the
left or right of the entrance to the building I could not make it in.
Finally I was able to turn around and ran for the Sanctus zone line.  Of
course, the whole time my movements were unresponsive, I was getting
messages about stonegrabbers pounding the daylights out of me, so they were
unaffected.

I have a nice DSL connection and have never had those kinds of problems
before.  I just guessed that their servers were overloaded.
