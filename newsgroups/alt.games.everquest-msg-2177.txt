You haven't been here long enough for me to get to know, but I seem to have
the impression that you don't say stupid or pointless things.  I could be
mistaken though...like I said, you haven't been around long enough. :)

Examples:

Stupid:   "Druids (or necros, or mages, or clerics, etc) should be nerfed!"
(this could also be termed pointless or trolling)
Stupid:  "I'm outraged that an expansion pack gives me free stuff and
doesn't fill the CD with 650MB of the expansion itself, and anyone who
disagrees with me are obviously children that know nothing about how CDs are
recorded."

Pointless: "This may be Usenet but I really don't see why you have to flame
people."

Hints:

1) Feel free to ask questions about EQ.  If you don't know the answer you're
ignorant, not stupid.  There's nothing wrong with ignorance if you learn
from the answer.

2) Feel free to answer questions about EQ.  Even if you're wrong there's a
good chance you won't be flamed (I've been wrong many times...only flamed by
a few idiots who almost always are wrong themselves).

3) If you feel inclined to give your opinion when solicited, try to avoid
black & white judgment statements.  Saying "twinking is just wrong and
people who do it are killing the game" is stupid...especially if left
without explaning why you think that.
