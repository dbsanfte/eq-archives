Palindrome  said:
}The "pseudo-traditional" image of a monk is someone who can move
}stealthily, evade and block blows in combat, use poison darts and
}weapons, and who also has some skills in herbs and medicine. 

See, it's an odd question.  Where did this 'pseudo-tradition' emerge?
The -traditional- image of a monk would be, say, St. Francis of Assissi, 
or Friar Laurence in Romeo and Juliet, or Friar Tuck, or the Dalai Lama.  
Not exactly DPS monsters... Not even likely to engage in combat, more 
likely to look for ways to avoid it, if at all possible.  Even Bruce Lee 
and Jackie Chan, whom you mentioned below, seem to do everything possible 
to avoid combat, and only use it when the plot absolutely forces them to.  
Jackie Chan, especially, has made an entire art form of running away.
Although he plays cops much more often than monks, lately.

So how'd we even end up even -having- monks in this game?  Much less 
agnostic monks?  If you wanted to properly roleplay a monk, shouldn't you 
be walking from town to town with a beging bowl instead of beating the 
crap out of everything you meet?  Sure, that wouldn't be much fun, but 
wouldn't that at least have a semblance of realism to it?  

}Oh, and Feign Death? I don't see quite how Feign Death made it as a
}monk skill - I cannot recall offhand any book or film where the monk
}could suddenly pretend to be a convincing corpse!  Well, not in any
}Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan movies I've seen ;)

They had it in AD&D, as I recall, which probably helps answer my question 
from above.  And in tune with what I said above, FD is all about avoiding 
conflict, which makes absolutely perfect sense for a pacifist follower of 
Quellious.  It doesn't make as much sense for a monk following Cazic 
Thule.  Iksar monks actually make some sort of sense.  Following the God 
of Fear, though, you'd think their intimidate skill might work a little 
bit better. :)

Monks in D&D made a lot more sense, where there's an actual human GM 
monitoring things, and he could actually give you experience for 
roleplaying properly, whether or not you actually kill anything.  But in a 
game built around acquiring experience, where the only realistic way to 
acquire that experience is by showing a lethal and blatant disregard for 
life, peace, and tranquility, monks generally are just not going to make 
any sense.  I think they should just rename the class martial artist, and 
do away with any semblance of holiness.  That would open up a whole world 
of possibilities for them, in the game, I suspect.

But look at what Merriam Webster has to say about monks for a sec:

  Etymology: Middle English, from Old English munuc, from Late Latin
  monachus, from Late Greek monachos, from Greek, adjective, single, from
  monos single, alone : a man who is a member of a religious order and 
  lives in a monastery;

And you're asking why monks have no role in a group?  They -should- be a 
solo class!  Their name is derived from 'solo' for Cazic's sake!

How about this:  Do away with human monks entirely, or let them all switch 
to following Cazic Thule, give them an intimidate skill that actually 
works, and make them powerful enough to fearkite solo in GoD.  Presto! 
Monk class fixed.  Monks wouldn't be very happy, I'm sure, but at least 
there'd be logic to it.

I could see logic also in giving them some part of enchanterlike 
abilities...  Consider that guy with the bulbous red nose in Princess 
Mononoke, who was clearly a monk, and more of the butt-kicking variety.  
But even he wasn't much in a straight fight, and got by by playing 
complicated political games of 'let's you and him fight'.
