  I am educated about the potential of that fact.  And I do group with
wizards, giving them the benefit of a doubt.  And doubt there is,
because I've found many, many wizards that don't know that one must wait
till the mob is half gone to open fire.  Going full burn as soon at the
target is within range is a Bad Thing, and I'm shocked how many wizards
there are that don't know that.  Presumably soloers, I suppose.  
   But yes, a well-played wizard is always welcomed in my group.
