    Yup. But they ALSO farm the hell out of zones with "essential" gear.
People wouldn't be in ToV killing drake after drake if they didn't need the
armour, after all. By going to PoM these "lesser" guilds are getting BETTER
armour than Kael (at least for the casters) while staying on Giant faction.
Although the antics of the Dragon guild alliance are making a few think of
switching over.

    No, but they sure do complain if it isn't up to their ideal of reward,
now don't they? But that gets into the area of escalation of power.

    SoL apparently won't have "phatter lewt" than Velious, although it will
contain the new "hardest zone in the game". Not having "phatter lewt" means
VI can FINALLY start to tailor encounter strengths correctly. If there's a
hard cap on the AC a given class can get per slot, number of HPs, stats,
resists, and damage per second at level 60 of a weapon, then PROPER
playtesting can occur. Instead of having a chain of boss mobs, each greater
than the last and each therefore expected to have greater drops than the
last, there can be several "top tier encounter" bosses with the same
relative power level. That allows for guilds to coexist, since on patch day
they could ALL grab a boss or two. As it is now, as guilds gain in power
they start fighting over the few mobs worth fighting.

    LoS had an interesting rant on The Safehouse once. They were furious
that Dozekar had been made weaker, because then they had to compete with
"gimp" guilds to get to him first and kill him. Hope that doesn't make them
too unhappy, because it's the future of EQ.

    Been to ToV, been bored stiff. Sounds like it's a necessary evil,
though.
