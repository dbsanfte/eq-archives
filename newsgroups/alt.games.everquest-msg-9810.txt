I am now averaging one sudden disconnect every 1 1/2 to 2 hrs play time.  On
a good night I can go 4 hours without a disconnect.  On a bad night I get
disconnected 3 times in 45 minutes.

     I have read every post and tried everything suggested.  I normally use
Windows 2000 Pro and DSL 640k connection.

        1. Am I hoping for too much. Is it really unrealistic to think I can
regularly play for 4 hours and not suffer one or two disconnects.  I know
everyone goes LD occasionally, but it seems like I do a lot more than those
I play with.

      Things I have tried
         1. Using an analog modem instead of DSL (noticed some lag)
          2. Dual booting Windows Me and running from ME (Improved sound)
            3. Updating all video and sound card drivers
                4. Increasing virtual memory.
                    5.  Setting CAS 2 memory to run Cas2.
                        6.  Stop overclocking processor
                          7. Running DSL alone with nothing else on sharing
the line,
                             8.Making sure sound card, video card and
DSL/ATM card are on there own IRQ
                                9. Stopping all backround operations
Anti-virus, any thing in system tray.
                                    10.  Set network/ehternet cards ip
address to prevent DHCP look ups(I USE a Intel 2100
ATM pci card/ not an external router for DSL.

Is Everquests software and network just inherently unrealiable?
