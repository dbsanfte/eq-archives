I have played a bit there, but not much as my main is on another
server.  It is insanely quiet to say the least LOL.

I do have a friend who plays there though and loves it.  She is a 24
Shaman IIRC and loves the way it works over there.  She says it is
very refreshing to see people running around in Banded,
Studded/Reinforced Leather and such  in the mid 20's even because that
is good armor there as there isnt a LOT of other options yet. 

She loves it though admits that it can be tough to get the items you
need sometimes for trades and such as there is a much lower server
population so you dont have as many people collecting them.

As for the RPing she likes that as well.  I think I would too but it
is hard for me to leave my main as I pretty much only play him (as
135+ days played on a 35 warrior will attest).  I do play his mirror
over on FV though on occasion but not often.
