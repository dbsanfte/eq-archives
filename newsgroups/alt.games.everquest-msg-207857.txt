Having helped a BL get his epic recently, I can tell you we went after 
whichever one we could find up at the time, in no particular order.  We 
did do the Permafrost one last, the others were done in no particular 
order.

The Permafrost battle is a bit of a pain, as it's down in the pits with 
the bears.  At our level, with one group of about average level 63, it 
was a cakewalk.
