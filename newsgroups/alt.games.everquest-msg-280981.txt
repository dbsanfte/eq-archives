	If you... read the above paragraph, it says:

	"I've made a living out of making every tiny little advantage I can get 
add up to something significant."

	That means that although more than likely getting all 5 levels of each 
of the mitigation and avoidance AA's for DoD will not show any effect 
that I'll notice outside a log parse, it's nevertheless important to get 
them, because its by adding up tiny advantages that I've got to where I 
am today.

	I didn't say I was useless to my guild without them... I'm not entirely 
sure whose message you're replying to here; it can't be mine.

	I simply said that tanking AA's are for more important to me on raids 
than clicky invis or staying feigned through casts.
