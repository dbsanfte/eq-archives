I play just because it's fun (for me). Regardless of whether it's the
interaction or the battles or what, it's a good time and that's all that
matters. Personally, I can't see how people with a good imagination and
history of fantasy books, etc. couldn't enjoy this game. But worse than
that is I can't understand why people would pay to play and then
complain, but keep paying and playing.
