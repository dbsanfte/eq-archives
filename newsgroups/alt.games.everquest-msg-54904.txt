As a paladin, I worry about Armor class and have worked to get fine plate
everything (still got a couple pieces of bronze).

Lately been hunting Split Paw.

Now I ask

would you trade in your fine plate collar (AC 8) for a split paw tooth
necklace (AC 2, +5 to CHR, +10 Poison save)??

Would you trade your sm bronze girdle (AC 7) for a split paw hide belt (AC
5, +5 Poison save)???

Basically is CHR stat / Poison save enhancement more valuable than AC to a
paladin?
