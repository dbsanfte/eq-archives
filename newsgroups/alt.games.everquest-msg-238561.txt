I hope so. What would I need a hi resolution 720x348 monochrome
display for? =p

But to say one should upgrade their Hercules would be lost on people
who associate the brand with recent-modern ATI cards. Better than half
the people out there have no idea what Hercules *was*... and if they
looked they'd likely find radeon 9800s... and figure you were making
an ati slam... 

few would get intended humour of the absurdity of even having a
Hercules card (the "real ones" at least)... unless you were actually
intending to make an ati slam ;)
