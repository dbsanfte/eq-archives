In my spare time, which EQ eats most of these days, I try to keep the PS2 in
use - just finished Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance and am 75% through Final
Fantasy X the first time around.  Looking forward to D&D Hero's and Devil
May Cry 2.  On the PC I just got Warcraft III, but haven't installed it
yet - used to love those types of games, but ever since the EQ bug bit, I
can't get as into them.
