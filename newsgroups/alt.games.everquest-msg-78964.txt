    My ENCH is also a High Elf that killed a few CB Orcs, although not many.
When she went to get the coin for Tash, she saw no NPCs along the way that
would give her any problems. When she went to the library for her Rod of
Insidious Glamour quest, she met one dark elf along the way that was dubious
through Teir'Dal Illusion. I imagine that one elf is the only one you need
to invis past. In general, the only Neriak elves you need worry about are in
the Warrior's guild, which is easy to avoid. But I will mention I DID run
into that one that was Dubious, and the first thought as to why was that he
was on Indigo Brotherhood faction.
