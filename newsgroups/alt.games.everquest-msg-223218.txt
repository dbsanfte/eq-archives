People generally say that myopic people have lower visual acuity
because their glasses shrink everything, but that's only generally
true for myopic people without huge eyeballs. For people like you and
me, the extra size means whatever gets projected on our retinas covers
a larger area and thus appears larger to our brains than 'normal'. The
glasses effect will partially compensate for this, but I wear mine a
little closer than the distance where it'd cancel out. Hence I can see
a tiny speck at 20/10 on occasion, and with your contact lenses, it's
all the other things that make your vision poor, not the size of what
you see.

How odd. I hope you mean when you look at the whole line, not when you
actually READ it (as in moving your eye so the fovea looks at each
letter in turn)

Hehe, I quit looking for job based on old degree and am getting new
degree that might give me a job :)

I took my boyfriend to one while I was in the US this summer. He was
happy when I told him what the different instruments tested when the
optometrist was out of earshot, while I was appalled at him only being
tested on a 20/20 line and not getting a lot of other measurements I'd
expect, especially from a first time appointment (including the
distance between his pupils). 
It's especially bad when they don't explain sufficiently that a
certain test relies on the patient seeing blurry pictures, so the
patient ends up thinking they're doing something 'wrong'.

I won't be a doctor. But I will be able to prescribe (and make)
glasses, and to send you to a doctor if your eyes show you need it.
I also have a vested interest in catching it if my retinas should
detach.
