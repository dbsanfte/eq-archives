    For pickup groups? Sebilis was always a favourite of mine. Lots of
multi-mob pulls, and a lot of cash loot. Frogs also cast, so you get to use
your stuns.

    The question I have is this, though: why are you bored as a cleric?
Being a cleric isn't for everyone, and I just want to see if you're bored
with what you've been doing or bored with the idea of being a support class.

    You don't give your overall WIS, which is important as the amount of
mana you gain/lose with changes in WIS changes when you go over 200 WIS.
Looking at your gear, and factoring in that you're a High Elf, I'd
guesstimate that you're at 200 WIS plus or minus ten points. I'll use that
when I make suggestions.

    Gold Black Sapphire earrings. HP 25 MANA 35. Watch the bazaar carefully,
you should be able to get them for 250 pp each.

> Finger: Platinum Jasper Ring 6 wis

    If you can find some friends, try going up to Fungus Grove and doing
some XP there. It's boring, but every so often the AoE group will shout to
the zone that there's some Shadel Bandit Rings available to be looted
(they're Lore). AC 5 HP/MANA 55 DR 10 CR 5 - it would be a good replacement
for one of your rings, especially seeing as you'd get it for free. I
wouldn't suggest buying one - they sell for 1000 pp, which is out of your
price range.

> Arm: Ethereal Mist Vambraces AC 15 str 9 svm 7

    If you aren't too badly off for STR, get some Donal's Arms when in
Sebilis. They drop commonly in the Disco camp.

> Shoulder: Tattered Mantle AC: 12 Disease Resist: 10 HP: 20

    I'd go with Adamantine Epaulets here (those old AC 9 WIS 7 shoulders
from Guk), and keep the Mantle as DR gear. Ad Eps go for a couple hundred
pp.

> Feet: Boots of the Reliant AC 11 svd 6

    Some of my guildmates have been selling Dusty Soriz Boots as low as 500
pp. They're AC 12 HP 40 and 25 points of resists, and I believe you could
wear them. A very nice general-purpose upgrade.
