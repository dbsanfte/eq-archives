I'm not happy with any current games I'm familiar with, as far as helping
and XP goes.

On the one hand, there are games like EQ1, where if someone helps on a mob,
they either get no XP or all of the XP.

    Pro: if you see someone in trouble, you can rush to their aid if you are
    careful to not do too much damage.  (Also, casting buffs and heals on
    them doesn't risk taking away their XP, so you can help someone that
    way).

    Con: it makes KSing possible.

On the other hand, there are games like DAoC, where the XP is split
according to the damage done.

    Pro: much harder to outright KS someone.  Generally not worth trying,
    because you will end up with about half the XP, as will they.  You are
    simply better off going and finding your own mobs.

    Con: Helping someone reduces their XP.  (Even healing them gives you
    some of the XP).

Just looking at it from an in-character point of view, helping should be
something that is almost always welcomed.
