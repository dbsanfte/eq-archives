Regardless, like monopoly your pp bank account is a scoring mechanism in 
EQ (granted EQ has multiple scoring systems). Along with your gear, 
level, and raid flags. At any rate, allowing you to up one of your 
scores with greenbacks violates the premise of what the pp score 
represents in terms of "Accomplishment in EQ".

But its not an in-game ecomony if you allow outside funds. It 
fundamentally transfers the economy of the game world to the real world 
wholesale.

That is a clear philisophical violation of what a fantasy rpg entails. 
Period.

A healthy economy? Is irrelevant. Its pegged to the USD and its health 
is ultimately governed in the Real World. Unemployment shoots into the 
statosphere and suddenly game plat becomes scarce... Johnny wins the 
lotto 6-49, and suddenly he's paying people 5kpp to suicide into Lava 
Pits en masse for giggles.... Billy finds an exploit and generates 
60,000,000,000,000pp and then spends the next year trying to pull it out 
of EQ without triggering tax consequences... meanwhile he plans his 
retirement...
