I was under the impression that it was any skill that involved combat and
was not a starting skill that required priming.  So, those skills that you
didn't "just get" but actually had to train at later levels required a
point.  IE - my Rogue 'gets' Riposte and Dodge without visiting the
guildmaster, but had to put a point into Backstab.
