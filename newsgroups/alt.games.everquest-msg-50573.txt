Ah, I'm too lazy to email you...yer gonna have to work at it to get the
answer. :P

INT/WIS (assuming you get spells at level 1) work the same way.  Each point
of INT gives you your level divided by 5 mana.

Say you're level 15 to make the calculation easier:

1 INT = level 15/5 = 3 mana
A 5 INT ring would give you 15 more mana (5 INTs x 3 manas per INT) than a
ring with no INT.

STA isn't something your mage should be worried about.  A point here & there
won't keep you alive. :)  After playing almost all casters for 2.5 years I
have no idea what that formula is because it's not significant.
