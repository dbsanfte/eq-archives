There is your issue.  The last set of drivers 3DFX released before
going under were barely DX7 compliant, let alone DX8.  Your best bets
are either going to 3dfxtools and trying one of the beta DX8 drivers
(not supported by anyone, including the ex-3dfx employees making them)
or getting another card.
