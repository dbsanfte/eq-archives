As far as Everquest is concerned they do nothing at all. They are all added 
by the install program. Everquest will function without them.

The only part of any real significance is the last key and it's values. You 
are basically correct. It just shows where the application is installed. 
Sometimes applications will store the paths to help files or utility 
programs here too. For example, ICQ stores the path to NDetect.exe under 
this registry key. But I digress.
