Because, if you limit what the parents can give to their children, you are
limiting the rights of the parents.  That type of interventionism, IMHO, is
far worse than any "unfair" advantage the kids get.  Also, there will always
be those who's parents have better equipped them to handle the world, ie
better parenting, teaching the children responsiblity, etc...  This goes for
blacks as well as whites.

Well, the societies (and taxes) of Nigeria, India, and Romania don't support
our educational system.

I'm upset because this unfairness is _government_mandated_; any further
replies on your part should at least answer to that point.

There are also many sandboxes run by blacks.  The government caters to them
all the time, with it's emphasis on awarding contracts to minority-run
businesses.

All of those examples are fatally flawed in that they are based on what the
person has done, not what he is.  A veteren should recieve preference
because he was willing to serve his country.  A non-citizen still maintains
his aliegance to his country of origin (and we don't exactly deny schooling,
anyways).  A convicted felon is only so because he chose to commit a felony.
Where is the ability to choose to become a protected minority?

Again, it's a matter of what they have done.  If the person is not convicted
and sentenced, then we cannot proceed as if it has been proven.  If he's
innocent, then he has done nothing to merit his state.

You cannot eliminate hatred by legal means, but you can sure as hell instill
it.
