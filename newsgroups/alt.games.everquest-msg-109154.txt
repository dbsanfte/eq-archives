True. But you're missing the point of what DT is saying. He's noting
quite correctly that "good" and "evil" are extremely subjective terms,
and vary from one individual to the next. You think they were evil. I
think they were evil. I imagine DT thinks they were evil, as well. But
from their own perspective, what did they think?
