<<<<<<> I won't be now and I'll be moving on.

Geez o'Pete ... how many times must you say goodbye?

Leave already!

Crash>>>>>

I'll be moving on from playing the game, not necessarily this group.  You
really are stalking me now though.  Have you even thought about how much of
what i've said about you rings true?  You have and it's bothering you just a
little isn't it?  That's why you keep following all my posts and trying to
prove me wrong because you know I'm right and deep down you don't like the
shallow little do-nothing base my whole life around a pc game loser you've
become.
