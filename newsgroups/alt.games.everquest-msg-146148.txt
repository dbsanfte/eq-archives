No, grouping with rogue is fun, if your agro control is doing good you can
help the group a lot and dealing tons of damage. Just make sure that your
tank pull the mob and you keep BS a few second after the fight start. When I
was 28, I fight in LOIO and FM and Overthere. I also spend some time in
lower guk as we need the mask and also SBD is a nice item to keep. Last, if
you not yet finish the burning rapier, you should consider doing this quest
at this level.
