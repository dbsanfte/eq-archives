I don't think its that big of a deal.  The people who were using /BUYSELL on
xegony (I was) wouldn't have been the ones to buy your bonechips anyway.  I
think it will make it a lot easier on newbie elves in gfay (not that there
are any ones really left on xegony heh).  There was more than 'uber' items.
Pretty much gfay of old was in /BUYSELL.
