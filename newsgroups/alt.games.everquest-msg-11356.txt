It used to be but its not really a PITA now - just get a decent ini file
editor (Pasketti's or something) and change the colours of all the
different types of message text to something you can see (you should get
a colour picker/set of sliders so not too tough), and set the opacity of
the chat window to be completely opaque (or 90% or something) so the
background of the chat box doesn't change colour when its in front of
different terrain. If necessary bump up the chat font size. You'll
wonder how you ever did without it - you can see so much more of whats
going on around you in full screen, it seems like you have tunnel vision
going back to windowed mode. Note that fullscreen mode is probably
horrible if you don't have Velious installed with all the interface
enhancements - but then I know you do have Velious, since you've been
wrecking your factions there :)

I used to swear by windowed mode because of all the little annoyances
with fullscreen mode - all the res-switching when looting/trading, the
smaller font size, the illegibility of text in the chat box, etc -
they've all been fixed. As soon as you use fullscreen for a bit you'll
never go back.
