Its sad that you have a hard time believing it. It is the whole reason that
casters are now getting balanced. Not only can a solo melee solo a low blue
mob at 60 they can do so while losing less health than they regen. This is
somewhat easier for monks than the other melees since monks have a good
natural regen anyway in mend but is possible for others. For an iksar monk
wearing a fungi and having spent his 12 aa points the regen is over 40
standing.

You would have to have adequate equipment though. An ac around the 1300
mark, 3000 hps and weapons at least as good as priceless 15 20. any 60 monk
in any uber guild qualifies easily. The grey is a favorite place for this
since the mobs only have around 4k hps only hit in the 140s.
