I'd give 50/50 odds this is Dalnir.  Fighting Baton anyone?  But suggesting
that much money is stupid, it's not that easy, I went down to the lumpy hall
on the second level, the place was swarming with goos and kly, attack one
and you get all 30.

Could also be the FM cycle given the numbers given, since only a few things
on the cycle are killable under 30, but by 35 a lot of them can be, and by
45 they are all easy to kill,  A guildie of mine managed to have 5 cycles
going at once before somebody else started breaking it up.

Actually, now that I think about it, this probably is the FM cycle, some of
the crap drops are worth less than 50, and some of the rarer drops are worth
upwards of 1k.
