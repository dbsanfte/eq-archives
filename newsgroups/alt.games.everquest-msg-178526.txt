I'm not sure how Zenin could make <an extra 1k> in 3 (or 4) hours
hunting HGs, but my Paladin can make over 200pp an hour off HGs
<without> KEI (less if there're too many Bard-parasites around).
Of course, in recent months the only reason I've hunted HGs was
to kill a few for KEI money, if I've got KEI I go somewhere that
I can (hopefully) get a group or manage half-decent xp solo (can't
xp worth a damn solo without KEI).

This is just silly.  I've watched people bitch about this for years.
EQ does NOT force you to spend all your mana in one or two fights,
you CHOOSE to play that way.  You are NOT forced to have downtime.
You take a class that has the option of focussing its power in
relatively short bursts (as opposed to a melee who does not get that
option) and then you whine about having to wait until you can once
again briefly have power way beyond what would be "balanced" for
your level.

>> It's simply not fun.  It isn't a "feature",

Play a damned melee if you don't like it.  It is a feature of your
class that you are not required to exercise your power evenly over
time.  A solo caster whining about recovery time is and always has
been the stupidest bitch in EQ.  Actually I should have said that
it <was> a feature of your class.  Now it is a feature of your class
that it is ridiculously overpowered.  Or perhaps, since casters and
caster classes outnumber melees, it would be more accurate to say
that, with KEI commonly available, melees (excluding extreme twinks
under L50) are once again as badly underpowered as they were early
in the history of the game.

And that's why KEI has changed the game.  Now there is no longer a
meaningful penalty complementing the casters' grotesquely unbalancing
advantage.  SOE has "cheapened" the experience of the game, bowing to
the pressure of huge numbers of whiny children demanding that they be
able to have their cake and eat it too.  That it was inevitable (the
whiners are a substantial fraction of the player base, SOE likes
their money every bit as much as anybody else's) does not make it,
IMO, a good thing.
