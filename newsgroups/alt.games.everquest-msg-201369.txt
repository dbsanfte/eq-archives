That depends on a lot of things.

Class?

Grouped or Solo?

Total actual played time or real life time counted in?

Are you grinding only or are you doing quests along the way? Like the epic?

Any trade skills? If so you can safely Quadruple any time estimates. =)

I made level 50 with my mage in 4 days played no twinking.
I did some quests and green farming alond the way. Mostly solo.

I made Level 50 on my monk in 20 days played no twinking.
I did a lot quests and green farming along the way. About half the time
solo and half grouped.

It generally takes the same amount of time to go from Levels 1-50
as it does from level 50-60.

Tips:
Fastest way I have found to level is to kill massive amounts of
low blues(not light blues just dark blues). Its safer and you have less
downtime.

Don't die and if you do die and are above level 40 get a rez. Lower than 40
you can generally gain the exp you lost faster than finding a rez
depending on where you are and how populated it is. Always
carry 50pp or a few peridots with you at all times to pay the cleric.
