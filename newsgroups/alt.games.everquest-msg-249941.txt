Lol, yeah I know the type. I think the whole fellowship-vassal-patron
construct created more grouping scenarios than would have otherwise been the
case for this game. Did you belong to one of those?

Yeah, in retrospect I proabably did rate SWG too high. I was taking into
account all the little duos and threesomes that people did just to have the
company of their friends around. But you're right, if you could solo a
Krayt, what other than this was the purpose of grouping?
