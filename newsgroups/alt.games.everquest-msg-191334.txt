We have some tradeskill freaks in our guild.  We have one that puts the 
rest to shame.  Tomorrow is the day we will try to get him his 8th shawl by 
escorting the General to the Pirates.

I've read the writeup on EQTraders on the escort.  Do you guys have any 
tips you can offer for the "event" that aren't on the EQTraders writeup?

TH - if you or any of your friends want to come along, you are of course 
quite welcome.  We may end up having to cancel it if we don't have the 
personnel there.
