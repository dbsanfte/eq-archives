Surely you mean 4x.4=1.6! :)

A good summary.  But one should note, speaking as one who's actually tried 
this...  Make sure you drop that last nuke to kill the quad -while you're 
in close proximity to the PLee-.

I tend to wander all over the zone when I'm quadding... and you know that 
'bug' where nobody gets any exp if the puller runs out to pull before the 
mob's dead?  Or when the mob runs away, and only those who chase it down 
and thump it get exp, and the casters who were medding get boned?

It sucks when you waste a whole quad that way.  Get the quad one nuke from 
dead, then train the PLee before you fire the last one.
