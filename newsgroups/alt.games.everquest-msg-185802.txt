I accidentially did a nosedive off the canyon wall in front of Kael,
and was hit for 20K damage. I filed a /report both in game and on the
web site, and today received a response from my server GM that I could
get a rez on that corpse, but that it had to be done while I was in
game, so I would need to file a /petition next time I'm on. What I'm
worried about is, there's only 2 hours left on the rez timer. What if
I log in and do the /petition, and the rez timer is up by the time
they get to me? Will I still be able to be GM rezzed?
