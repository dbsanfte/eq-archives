There's lots of info on the SBLive available at:
http://www.3dsoundsurge.com/drivers/Live/index.html

With W2K info at:

I'm using 98SE, so YMMV, but one thing I have noticed is that the Live
drivers for 98 are quite old and Creative seem to have stopped updating
them, but you *can* run older cards (I have a Live Value CT4830) using
the drivers for the 5.1 cards.
