Actually, neither is right *g* It's /chatfont size <number> with the 
number being anything from 1 to 6, 1 being the smallest, 6 being the 
largest.  Dream King is right in that there's a HUGE difference between 
4 and 5 for some reason - 4 is much too small for me, and 5 is just a 
bit too big - but seeing as I wish to read my screen, I go with 5.  So:

/chatfontsize 5

Ryou
but since the OP pointed out that this isn't the problem, it's kind of a 
moot point:
