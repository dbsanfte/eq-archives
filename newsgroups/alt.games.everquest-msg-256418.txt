Specifically, duelling someone who can summon a pet can help raise skills,
because you can fight the pet and gain skillups from it.  The few times I've
dueled someone I've not seen any skill increases from fighting another PC.
As long as the pet is at least Cyan to you, you can fight it for gains in
Offense and defensive skills.  Just called "timeout" and have to pet owner
back the pet off while you stop attacking, once in a while. The fighters
heal up and you can go back at it.

Your Druid can summon a bear pet at 55, but I think little BooBoo will be
too low for you to gain skill.  I honestly don't know if this works with
Charmed pets, but perhaps others might.
