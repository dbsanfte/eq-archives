But you are using their software. Without looking at the EULA or the 
stuff you agree to during the install, I am quite certain that there is 
something in there where you agree to using it only on official EQ 
servers and that any other use is in violation of the Terms of Use.

You don't get to install/use the software.

It depends on the intent. If the intent is to ensure that traffic is 
being most efficiently routed, probably not. If, however, it is being 
sniffed to aid in the reverse-engineering/hacking, it probably is.

Don't know about the EULA, but he would probably be going against the 
copyright/IP covering it. Especially if he is going to be using it to 
create a direct competitor to EQ.

It is if the other product states that you are only to use the product on 
their severs.

Not in this case, no.

Wrong. Each time the player loads EQ, they are agreeing to the terms 
stated in the EULA.

You can reverse engineer, however to use thier IP for your own use is 
illegal and requires the payment of royalties/licensing fees. To use it 
without their permission is not permitted.

Red herring. This doesn't have anything to do with the argument in 
question.

But when you disagree with it, you don't get to use the software.

The thing is, buying model figurines is completely different from 
buying/using software. When you buy figurines, you buy them and they 
become your property. When you buy software, it doesn't become your 
property. You are paying for the right to use a copy of the software, 
that is it.

What makes it different is that models and software are two completely 
different things. Thus, the comparison of one to another is not valid.
