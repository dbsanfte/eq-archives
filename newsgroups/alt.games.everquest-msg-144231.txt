    Monks aren't supposed to be able to move through a solid wall? The "get
a monk up through the roof" means exactly that - get him Flung (that's the
name of the GFlux-like ability the boss in the lower room has) up to the
roof, and either by having him in wolfform or by having him duck and unduck
at the right time get him through the floor and up into the next room. He
Feigns immediately. After the fight in the lower room is over, he stands and
the rest of what I described happens.

    The GM claims they turned down the force on Fling to prevent this sort
of thing from happening, but last night we got wiped out when pets (yes,
stupid us) that were on a big blob with Fling got flung through the roof and
pathed through the courtyard to come back to us, bringing every last mob
from the courtyard. Not only was that train incredibly lethal, but the
courtyard mobs that warped onto us refused to path back home and are now all
hanging out in a fairly crucial area until the next patch.

    Had LoS said "someone got Flung upstairs, we trained ourselves by
accident" there would have been no issue. But from what I can read into
what's been said so far, I'd bet they did this on purpose to pull that mob.

    People flying up through the roof better not be "working as intended".
And it's very important to make that point, because anyone with two Spined
weapons and some time can push themselves through any roof in the game
(lord, I hope they nerf those stupid things soon).

    Being able to go through the roof.

    Most people would. =)
