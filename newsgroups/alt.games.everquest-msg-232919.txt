Try turing the machine right off, wait a few, and bring it back up.
Verify that the link light for the ethernet cable is on on your PC (if 
it has one), and on your ADSL router (it had better have one!).

If you are using an onboard LAN port, pop into BIOS and ensure its 
enabled. (It should be if its still showing up in windows, but it 
doesn't hurt to check). If you've got multiple LAN ports (several 
motherboards do these days), make sure you are in the right port.

If your lights are down, swap cables, swap router ports, etc. If that 
doesn't resolve it remove your network adapter from the Device Manager, 
reboot and reinstall it. If that doesn't resolve it get a new network card.

If your lights are up, pull up the command prompt (cmd), try pinging 
both the Mac and the gateway. You can also trying pinging the PC from 
the Mac from the OS X terminal command line.

Where does that get you?

-PS there is nothing flakey about the tcp/ip stack in XP Home. The 
'flakiness' has to do with some of the arbitrary limits MS imposed on 
the Home Edition to Windows File Sharing, and the security model imposed 
on users to 'motivate' business users to purchase the Pro version.
