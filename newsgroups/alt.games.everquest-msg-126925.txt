While I have no experience with Grimmy, I can tell you
that the Snow Griffins in EW, which run faster than a SOWed
ranger.. are really just normal speed mobs (faster, of course,
than an unSOWed ranger) with SOW on.  Use the Cancel
Magic line on them, the bigger the better, and you can strip
that buff off.  Of course its buried in there about 5 deep under
the two ranger DS, and feet like cat and something else...
they sure are wimps if you remove those buffs.

Possibly Grimfeather just needs a little similar attention?

They are also slower with their buffs up than a level 30 bard
with Walrus Skin Drums.
