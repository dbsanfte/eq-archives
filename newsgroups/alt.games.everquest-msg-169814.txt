True, but I believe there's an assortment of caps, like eg. that you 
can't save more than 35% of the mana cost of any given spell (not at all 
sure of that number, it was anally extracted :) ).  There are some item 
effects which stack with each other too.  I was referring to the ones 
where the name's the same and the number differs, though, like Affliction 
Efficiency II and IV.
