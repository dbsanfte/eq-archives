Probably because no one can predict how a jury will decide any case, civil
or criminal.  So why chance loosing such a decission when even if you win
the probability of collecting any judgment is slim and none.  Most of thoes
selling games or game items for currency wouldn't have the kind of assets it
would take to pay for the stationary Sony's litigation would use let alone
the actual settlement.  Better to just handle it by revoking access on a one
by one basis and wait until someone challenges you.  Seems logical enough
but who knows why the really don't drag offenders into court?  Who really
knows for sure except for Sony's legal department and I doubt there going to
shair that with any of us.
