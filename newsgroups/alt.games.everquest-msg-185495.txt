Clinton may have been a reprehensible person, but as a president, he was
1000x better than GWB. Sure, he had his flaws, but they had nothing to
do with his performance. In fact, he managed to get more good work done
while the republicans focused completely on his personal life than Bush
does without people having to hold him back.

And at least Clinton was literate and could speak at at LEAST a sixth
grade level. My toddler speaks better than Bush at times. 

As for the implication that Hillary ran the country, is that any worse,
or particularly different, than the fact that Bush is just a party
puppet who does what Chaney and crew want him to do,

I will take a moral reprobate who knows how to run a country than a
mentally deficient puppet who is determined to start an uneeded,
unwanted, and unwise war.
