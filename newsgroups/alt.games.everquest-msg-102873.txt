There are no "underground folks". Just Bondl. Don't bother going through
the sewers, nothing in that whole town can see through invis.

That would be pretty stupid, wouldn't it?

You shouldn't even bother to follow him. When he starts walking, just go to
the room. The spirit will show in a minute or two.

I have heard a rumor that some of the quest mobs were made to not talk to
people under 50. Depending on how young of a hatchling you are (and the
veracity of the rumor), you may not be able to get very far in the quest.
