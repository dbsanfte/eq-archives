Because after a 4 hour raid a DoN is a refreshing break... after 4 hours 
of DoN's (folling a previous days 4 hours of DoNs, and the day before 
that's 4 hours of DoNs...) yet another DoN is strangely unappealing. :)

It seems to me at least that its becoming apparent that this 'gear gap' 
issue is primarily (but not exclusively) an issue for knights/warriors. 
Support classes (including monks) aren't generally demanded to have 
gear.

Tanks are. (And occasionally some specific caster is 'expected' to have 
some specific spell... e.g. a high enough level mez...)

Fair enough. Finding a suitable raid guild for a off-peak or erratic 
player is brutal. Raid guilds like to do raid every day, or every other 
day at a set time and they like everyone one to be there most of the 
time.

For the more erratic players who want to spend 3 months raiding on 
thursdays unless they're going out with friends, then take a month to 
mostly fool around with an alt, then want to raid some more but this 
time randomly on Tuesdays or Saturdays unless a new movie comes out that 
they want to see...  its exceedingly hard for people with external 
commitments and obligations and interests to commit to a raid schedule.

And even if they do find a guild that's willing to "take them when 
they're on" they'll still find it unproductive as they'll likely hurt 
progession once they get into the complex encounters because they won't 
know whats going on and of course they'll be down at the bottom of the 
dkp or whatever loot system is in place.

And then there just a lot of people who don't like raiding. Who find it 
down right unfullfilling to be a faceless dps class in a large group, 
following orders, and being personally responsible for 1/50th of the 
damage. Or who despise the politics and bullshit that goes with 
selecting targets, revising the dkp system/awarding loot, etc to the 
point that it undermines their enjoyment.

I think you failed to take into account that that below a certain 
critical mass of 'regularly scheduled' play time it becomes impossible 
to do any more than seize on pick up raids of opportunity, which are 
often dismal failures and are rarely doing anything newer than teir 1/2 
PoP. If you add off-peak to the list you can just forget about it.

LMAO :)

I manage to raid once or twice a month. And that's about as much as I -
can- raid. I've won around 3 drops this year. I've since upgraded all of 
them with 1-group content (LDoN, camps, etc). My limited raiding is for 
the change of pace not gear... I'd actually be losing ground on what the 
1-group players were wearing if i wore my 'raided' gear.

True, but it breaks down when the golf courses tell you you can't solo 
there, and the other 3-somes refuse to group with you because you aren't 
good enough. Enjoy that.

He pays his green fees, he's part of the club... he has every right to 
feel entitled to do more than dip a toe in the expansions they nag him 
to buy every time he logs in. I'm not saying we should give him uber-
raid-gear... but these players do need to be included more. They are 
entitled to THAT. Dumping them into a single instanced zone in the new 
expansion or telling them there is all this old empty obsolete content 
they can go play by themselves in just doesn't it.
