So don't be nosy OR give them plat, if your generosity is based on
inspection first.

Or, if you're talking about a friend you're upgrading, have them toggle the
option to ALLOW you to inspect them.

Verant wants it to be intrusive.  You want it to be intrusive.  Lokari wants
it to be intrusive.  I want to be able to opt out.  I may or may not be in
the minority but we're almost as loud as you are. :)  I'm happy that they've
given me a tool in which to be IGNORANT of such intrusions and I turned it
on the very first day, but it would have been nice if they fixed it the
RIGHT way.
