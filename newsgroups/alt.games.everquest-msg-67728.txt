I started playing an enchanter recently (have played a pally to level 30)
and am now level 11. Still wearing cloth.

What are the best items for me to upgrade to and where can they be found.
I'd like to move to mid level armors without breaking the bank. I see quests
for bear hide boots/capes, wolf belts and have seen cured silk armor (but
who makes / where do you buy it)?

Lastly I have been using a fine steel 2-h staff, but hope to do the stein of
moggok quest soon meaning I'll need to go 1-h weapon. What is a reasonable
weapon for me to obtain and where?
