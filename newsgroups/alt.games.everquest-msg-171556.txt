    Always bother to sell. Sticking an item on your overnight trader costs
almost nothing, and all those 750 pp's start to add up fast. Especially when
you're a tradeskiller, as you are. Every time I'm in CoD (as an example) and
another one of those too-common Maces of the Fallen Crusader drops, I loot
it, move it to the sales bot that night, and usually sell it same-day for
2000 pp. 2000 pp is a fair number of tailoring combines!

    There is. One of the named skeletons in those mines drops a No Drop,
cleric only item with three charges of "Summon Peridots". Each charge
summoned a stack of actual Peridots. It was a great reason to help out
farming bane ore!

    The quest to get into Inner Acrylia has been disabled for some time now.
They wanted to re-itemize the place to make it worth the immense effort to
get there, but seem to have put the whole project on the back burner. It is
one of the greatest flops in EQ.

    The Praesertiums are interesting mobs, but they don't have the sorts of
drops that would justify actually raiding them more than required to key up
for Seru. I always thought if they buffed them up a little and gave them
some reasonable guards that the zone might be worthwhile to raid, but as is
it's a stop for shard campers, and the one raid a week that's there for an
hour to kill Seru.

    A mix of both. There's no question players have been spoiled about loot
ever since Kunark came out and Monty Haul areas like the Crypt in Sebilis
were created. But by the same token the designers are very lazy about
getting stuff completed and tuned before release, and the players always get
there before the designers finish stuff.

    You should be sitting at about 7 percentage points below what a
grandmaster gets (so if the GM has 70% success, you have 63% success).
Depending on how good the full success rate is, you should be fine making
the stuff. And Heraldic is an immense cash cow - even in my guild all the
warriors have at least one piece of it on.

    I'm sooooo lucky in that regard. Remember a while back, when for a
period of about a week or two a cleric could scribe any of the Imbue spells?

=) =) =) =) =) =)

    Still miffed that I missed Imbue Amber, though. It was the only one
where I got lazy and asked a newbie to buy it for me, instead of sending in
an alt, because I thought the spell might not be there. It was, but the
newbie didn't find it and I didn't try to verify. Bad on me.

    Yeah, I'm looking forward to using strands to go from 191 to 212.
Especially since the things are on every damned vendor, and cost so little
to buy off vendors. Watching Bazaar folk gouge on tradeskill supplies can be
depressing.

    Yeah, I still need to max out my Pottery and make my faithstone. I used
to get an x-loc to The Nexus and re-bind there, but now with AoE x-loc to
bind wizards are getting lazy. ;-) I'm not sure we'll ever go back to Vex
Thal, though, so it may be a moot point.

    Just be sure to have that gamma turned up, and have Acumen. It's not too
bad once you're in deep, but it's still a pretty dark place. City of
Shadows, and all that.
