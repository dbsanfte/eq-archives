To what extent does haste stack? If you have a 41% haste item such as
the Gorget of Superiority and haste cast using Kizrac Gauntlets 30%,
do you have 71% haste, or so the higher of the two prevail ?

What about if you are wearing a 41% item, and have valons 68%? Which
would total 109 but that can't be,  so, what is your haste? capped at
100% or does the higher prevail an you are at 68?
