If you're talking what weapons to specialize in, try to max your
skillups in all of them available to you as you progress through your
levels.  You never know when a good weapon will drop and you don't want
to be level 65 holding a Great Staff of the Four Winds with a 2 skill
in 2HB.  Moreover, in the high end game your H2H caps higher than all
the other weapons available to you.

If you're really bored you can read through the "bio" button on my
magelo and see how I did it (detailed the zones I fought in from
30-65).  However, it's looking like LoY zones will now be exp heaven
with all the new ZEM bonuses.

To each his own I suppose.  You can always look through the Hunting
grounds section of these boards: http://tinyurl.com/32nuh

Best of luck!
