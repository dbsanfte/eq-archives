There used to be the same problem with Enchanter mobs,
they could Charm you with ease, even if they were *way*
green to you.

But that was mentioned as changed in one of the recent
flurry of patch messages -- now you get a normal
level/MR check against being Charmed.

And I can verify it.  Last night I soloed the Sirens outside
of Sirens Grotto to clear them away before our raid
group came through, and although they tried to Charm
me a total of about 30 times, not one stuck (58 Paladin
with 91 MR).  Hooray.

I wonder if Drowsy and some other "too easy to land"
spells now work by the same rules.
