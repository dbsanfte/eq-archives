:Quick and (hopefully) easy one.:

    Jazz this quest is really easy.  I did mine at lvl 26 by myself,
dragging along a 40 druid just in case to Lake Rathe for the bone rods, but
it turned out I didn't even need him.  Bring along a higher level friend for
protection (I like the druid choice for porting, healing and rooting
purposes) and you should have no problem doing this with just your wizard:)
Best of luck to you:)
