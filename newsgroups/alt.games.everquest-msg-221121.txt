Plat is more plentiful and steadily decreases in real-world value.
When I first saw people selling plat on EBay, it was going for about
US$100/10kplat.

This is a product of an economy with far more inflow than outflow.
There is more plat in EQ today than there was yesterday. There will be
more plat tomorrow than there was today.

I've seen less people quit to play SWG than I've seen quit out of
sheer ennui since SWG came out.
