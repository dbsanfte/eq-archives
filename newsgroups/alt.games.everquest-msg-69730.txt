It's HUGE.  It's scarcely populated.  I never see any high level mobs with
the exception of a werewolf on full moons and an occasional giant.  However,
once in awhile I see a small group of high level players there for some
reason.
What exactly is in this giant boring zone?  It really doesn't bother me or
anything, but when I'm making the big hike to Qeynos, this seems to be half
the trip and it seems so empty.

TIA and safe travels,
Sean...
