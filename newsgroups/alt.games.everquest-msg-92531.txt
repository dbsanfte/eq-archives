Healing potions are very expensive, and bandages aren't all that great.

Hate to tell you this, but EQ really is a grouping game.  I don't know what
level you are but if you're playing a warrior, rogue or other
solo-very-unfriendly class you're going to be very disappointed in the game.
If you don't like the idea that you're stuck having to make friends in order
to progress you're going to be very disappointed in the game.
