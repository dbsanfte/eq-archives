    Well, he does have an inflammatory style, so I can see how Kaev would
take it as trolling.

    The two of you have been talking about different things. Every post I've
seen from hybrids on FoH's own site said, to paraphrase, "Sucks to be you,
maybe they can toss you a bone, but don't nerf us or get fast aggro or we're
buggered and we'll hate you forever." So that doesn't address the balance
issue. Here is the balance issue:

(1) Knights can get reliable fast aggro at will and hold it almost
indefinitely with the amount of mana regen in game. Warriors cannot get
reliable fast aggro at will. Since DPS classes want to maximize their DPS,
they prefer the tank that holds aggro at will.
(2) Knights can deal with getting and holding aggro. They have AC values
very close to those of warriors, and HPs very close to those of warriors.
This means they are almost as easy to heal as a warrior. So there is no real
reason to have a warrior instead of a knight, as long as a tanking /disc
isn't required.

    Any change that addresses these two points is going to involve fast
warrior aggro OR a nerf to knights. You can't get around it. Say you itemize
future expansions to make knights weaker than warriors - that does not
change the balance of things for warriors and knights that are below that
level of play. Warriors at that end will still be hosed in comparison. You
have to make fundamental changes to the classes, changes that hit everyone.
And paladins, at least the ones I've read like Kreugen, are scared shitless
by this and are fighting it tooth and nail. They remember when they were
second class and laughed at, and don't want to go back to being considered
tanks of last resort.

    He's not talking about you, he's talking about the class design. The
class abilities knights currently have, via buffs, AA's, gear, etc.,
overstep the bounds that were set for the class in design.

    Note how the warrior is supposed to tank the most powerful of foes,
according to that description? Problem is, they don't. Two of the four gods
in the last phase of Time before Quarm (end boss) are tanked by hybrids, not
warriors. Hybrids with Time gear are also perfectly good tanks for a good
deal of the elemental content. That's something that's very unnerving to
warriors, that they're being replaced on content that they've just moved
past. Imagine, in the old days, using a paladin to tank Dain after you'd
cleared NToV. Or using a shadow knight to tank Trakanon after having just
cleared Veeshan's Peak.

    The warrior description also mentions going "toe-to-toe" with the foe.
Well, which one of you is tanking? Can't be both of you.

    The only ability you could give a warrior that would allow him to do his
thing would be fast, reliable aggro. And no sane knight or developer would
want warriors to have that. What's left? Knight nerf.

    The paladin nerf I'd like to see is for Crusader's Aura to no longer
stack with Focus. On raids, it knocks 300 to 600 HPs off the paladin and
makes them appreciably weaker tanks than warriors. In many XP groups, this
change would be a non-factor. In XP groups with a shaman, it would force the
paladin to choose between the extra 600 HPs or the mana regen to maintain
solid aggro. That would make the paladin a weaker tank relative to what he
was in groups with a shaman, which may help a warrior get a group in areas
where a shaman is preferred (tougher XP mobs). Such a simple thing, but it
accomplishes most of what the warrior rebalancing crowd wants done.
