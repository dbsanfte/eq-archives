Strawman.  The stuff thats dropping off low-level mobs in Stonebrunt for
instance, TCC managed stuff - is *well* beyond rusty daggers wiseass and you
fucking know it.

Oh, and I'd forget about replying to Cortese as he indicated in another
group he frequents that he was full to the rafters of this elitist attitude
so many of you *helpful* sorts have here (and in the game for that matter).

Now Thomas, from me to you - go fuck yourself.  Oh yeah, and TCC is your
daddy, deal with it.
