  The new Iksar character model in particular is much improved over the old.
What I personally want to see are the new erudite models though, and more of
the new polygonal plate armors.  It'll be nice for a fully armored knight to
actually appear more "bulky" than a guy in robes... the skintight armor
really was starting to get old.  So far all the character models do look a
lot better (in my opinion), though I'm not too impressed by the high elf.
Maybe he'll look better once they get him in some robes or armor.

  Hopefully an Athlon XP 1900+ and a GeForce3 TI500 won't be necessary to
keep the game from playing like a slideshow.
