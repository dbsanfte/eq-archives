Speaking of quests, has anyone ever seen an NPC named Tolon Furbyte in
Felwithe? I was given a quest that involves him but doesn't appear to be
anywhere in the city. I checked the Akhalazam (sp?) site and there is no
mention of any such quest originating in Felwithe. Are there any other
websites with quest info that I can look at? I'm not necessarily looking
for a blueprint of the quest, just a clue. I've wasted a lot of time
that I could've used hunting looking for this "shady" NPC.
