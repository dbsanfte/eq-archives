I was in Seb last night with a 52 rogue.  He said that he couldn't pull
because he didn't have but 700AC.

Err, my level 59 self-buffed ENCHANTER has 696AC (yeah, I know, it's
crappy...I'm working on that).

I ended up pulling 'cause of my level (worked out fine) but I TOLD them that
it was because my AC was better than the rogue's (he's going for STR and he
was an idiot so I didn't feel like teaching him...his main is a 58 cleric so
he knows ALL :p ).

Luckily the cleric went LD a couple times (after fights, thank god) so that
gave me an excuse to bail.
