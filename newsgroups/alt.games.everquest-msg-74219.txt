The effect is the same, whether you sell it to them on the cheap, or give it
to them outright.  If they are paying less than what the vendor would charge
them, then there is some degree of twinking going on (sure, you may use the
term "vibrant economy," but that doesn't make it any different).  The net
result, either way, is that the character is getting something that they
otherwise wouldn't be able to.

The economy has led to the same type of inflation that twinking does, only
slower.  I was talking with one of the guys on my ship, telling him that I
was planning on questing the Armour of Ro once I hit 30.  His first response
was that Ro was beneath me, and I should be buying Deepwater Armour.  Was it
really Verant's vision for level 30 Pally's to be wearing Deepwater?
Somehow I have my doubts.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
