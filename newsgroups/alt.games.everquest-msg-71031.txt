>that's dynamic like EQ?

Yes.
A "Dynamic" game lives and dies by it's content. EQ is not a single
game. Over the last 2-3 years it has grown through expansions.
Unfortunately the last growth spurt took the game beyond the hardware
of some players.

>... shouldn't be punished for choosing not to buy it, and that's basically what Verant's done. OS issues
>aside, Verant also screwed everyone who didn't buy Luclin. 

You are *completely* wrong about this. Only Win95 users have been
"punished" to use your word. A few others with older hardware (eg
non-DX8.1 compatible video cards) are having some problems.

>How do you think everyone who plays a bard felt, after Luclin went live, and found that their
>class was completely and utterly unplayable?

This was fixed within the first couple of days. Bards have been broken
before, and unfortunately it will probably happen again. They are a
complex class when it comes down the coding.

>That sort of thing, and a host of other problems,
>affect folks who didn't want Luclin, didn't purchase Luclin, and don't
>*intend* to purchase Luclin. 

You can't stop the world from turning. The people that chose to
sit-out Luclin suffered equally with those that purchased it. Patch
days and server outages effect all players.

24/7 service available most of the time (except for patches) to anyone
in the world with a compatible PC and an Ineternet provider. I am
sorry my friend, but if you do not call that quality service, I don't
know what is.

You have obviously never been an AOL member. When AOL 5.0 launched it
killed many PCs due to a bug in the client software. People are
constantly being dropped, and that is if they were lucky enough to get
on without a busy signal in the first place. 

>Beginning to see my point yet, or should I just quit wasting my time in

There are many sides to any issue.

>This is Verant's screw-up. 

Forcing DX8.1 unannounced, Yes

>Not Microsoft's, 

MS decided to drop support for Win95, so they are partially to blame

>not the end user...

Upgrades are part of owning a computer. If the "end user" does not
want to face periodic "forced" upgrades (for whatever reason) they
should go out and buy a game console, and a typewriter.
