With groups I rather have more melee, but with duo I rather have anyone who
can root and dot since I am not a tank and I cant do major healing either.
Not sure about mages since I dont think I've ever duo'd with one.  Think
your pet could tank?  OTOH, I once duod with a monk and she seemed to be
able to heal up well enough herself.  Just random thoughts I guess.   Hope I
haven't been too inconclusive. :-)
