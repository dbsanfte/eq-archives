What you're doing "very wrong" is thinking that since you don't have a horse
(or whatever) you suck.  It's your attitude that's wrong.  This game isn't
about instant gratification.

I've been playing 3 years and I have TWO characters that are 50+ (52 druid,
56 enc).  If I pulled all my money together among all my characters (2
accounts that originally belonged to me, about 14 characters) I MIGHT have
enough money to buy the CHEAPEST horse (about 7500p).  My situation is
common enough (being broke at high level) but I'll be the first to admit
that there are others who have lots more money than me at level 30 on their
first character because their goals are different from my own.

If you have the attitude that this game is like most of the others out
there...that you'll be able to accomplish end-game things in the first few
months, you're simply playing the wrong game.
