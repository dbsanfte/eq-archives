Slightly longer range my scorched and smoking behind.

I camped the Troll SK in Rathe Mountains for quite a while and I got
to truly loathe that bastich's Harmtouch. Unless I was very careful
about being far enough back (and this distance was about 1.5 to 2
times the width of the Tower), I WOULD get hit by that Touch.

True, many of those times I got my first spell off before the SK used
Touch on my pet, but I was still WAY out of melee range when he zapped
me with it.

Try this: Have someone with a Bow shoot at an NPC SKnight from way
back. Note how far from you and your sword he/she is when you suddenly
"writhe in agony". I say that NPC Touch has a way longer reach than it
should, but that's just my opinion...
