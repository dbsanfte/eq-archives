Thought I'd get some advice on what sort of new equipment I should be going
for.  I'm a 35 High Elf Cleric with 187 Wisdom.  Been hunting Giants in
groups in Rathe Mtns and making around 100pp every two hours or so.  So
looking for advice about what I should be shooting towards.  A balance
somewhere between semi-quick reward and willing to save up for something
really good.  So not items that are gonna cost in excess of 1.5k sort of
deal.  I do have access to Luclin/Bazaar.  I look around in there, but I'd
rather know some things that would be better for me to save up for than
minor upgrades that will waste my money away.  Thanks in advance for any
advice.
