Where can you hunt that hurts Cabilis faction?  Well, unless you've been
hunting in Cabilis itself for some really strange reason.

You have Legion of Cabilis maxxed, which is what you need non-kos to do the
bone chips to trooper Mozo in FoB.

Note that just because "your faction with Legion of Cabilis cannot get any
better" does NOT make you ally, most non-iksar max out iksar factions at
indifferent. (might be amiable for Cazic worshippers, possibly Innoruuk and
agnostic also)
