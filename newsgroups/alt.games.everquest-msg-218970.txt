I'm a swordsmith by trade, when I create something I my instinct
isn't to treat it like a delicate flower, its to pick it up by
the handle and bash it into a log repeatedly, poke the point into
something and then stand on the flat, twist, hammer, and
otherwise do my level best to destroy it.

Then I make another one, designed to hold up better against
whatever broke the first one.  When I can't break it anymore, NOW
its a weapon!

I guess I'm looking at your idea the same way; as a devil's
advocate: what's wrong with it?  Much easier to fix, replace or
if totally unworkable, discard the idea now, before it really
gets rolling in its present form.  Oh wait, I just thought of the
word for it, its not devil's advocate, its "constructive
criticism".

(If you wonder why I'd apply my "test to destruction" plan to
ideas outside the realm of blacksmithing, well there's an old
saying: To a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. 
"Man with a Hammer" is a pretty good job description for me,
although many of my friends call me Runs With Scissors.)

Yes I saw that one, interesting in a way, but doesn't handle the
LD part, and doesn't combat the PLing angle.  Guild logs on the
guild PLing tools, casts a full set of buffs, then the people
with those accounts go to bed, and you play your character while
they sleep.  Particularly handy for regen, haste, and DS; with
this combo anyone can be level 30 overnight, might as well just
enable testbuff on live servers.

Thats a much better PLing preventer, as being forced to group
with high level people is really going to cut into the PLing
potential.  Still, once you are in level range, go ahead and
group, just stay out of exp sharing range and you are fine. 
(Even in the same zone, if they are far enough away they don't
take any of the exp, and if they didn't do any damage, they don't
keep you from getting any)

You didn't NOT suggest it either.  But a duplicate line of spells
would go a long way to alleviating some of the drawbacks of your

Sure it is, you don't know in advance that they are going to LD. 
But your suggesting of them reverting to the timed version would
take care of that to some extent; then you wouldn't have to know
in advance after all.

Utility would be much higher if you could click them off
individually.  But now thats another 18+ slot window, with icons
and names for each slot (DS on Ralph, Regen on Ralph, Regen on
Bearash, etc.)

No no, its err drastically on the side of the players, leave it
that way for a week, then patch it drastically in the opposite
direction so its pretty much worthless for all intents and
purposes, leave it that way for a year, patch back to too good to
be true, leave up for two hours, patch back to worse than ever,
leave up for 6 weeks... clearly you don't work in the gaming
industry.

I did make several suggestions already, such as the Off Switch
idea, the "limit to group" idea, the fact that you could just run
a bard if you want things to work that way...

But here's another for you.  Make it so bards don't have to
overlap and constantly twist songs, just have 5 slots that they
can leave running at the same time, or click off to change song
or retarget.  Leaves out the Carpal Tunnel balancing plan, of
course, but it would be pretty close to what you seem to be
describing at this point.
