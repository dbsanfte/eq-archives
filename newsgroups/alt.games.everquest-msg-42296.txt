First, I'll say that ten bucks for three months isn't that much for the
amount of stuff available on that site. I use it almost *daily*. I
haven't signed up to pay for the full service yet, but I'm leaning
towards it, providing I can access it from all of the computers I use it
from without some sort of cookie nightmare to deal with.

However, the comment "adding new functionality that's only available to
paying members." isn't accurate. I happen to be one of the raid leaders
for an alliance of three guilds that we are in. One of my favorite links
on there has been the "equipment by zone" feature so people can see
ahead of time what items drop from what mobs in a zone we plan to raid.
That feature has been there as long as I can remember, and it's now part
of the premium service. I'm sure there are tons of other examples. I hit
that one the first day.
