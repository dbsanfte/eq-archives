    Last time they played with aggro they effectively disabled all "pure
hate" effects, like Enraging Blow. I wouldn't be surprised to see it had
happened again, and only pure damage was being considered for hate. We did a
parse on one boss last night, and the person with the highest DPS, a rogue,
was the one to get killed. That shouldn't happen if Evade is working.

    KtF must not have a big group of healers, then. Here's what changed on
Fennin, from what I've heard, and it's just two things. One, he no longer
has AoE Rampage. Instead, he has single Rampage with 300 range. Two, the
range on his AoE has been decreased a little. So now you can put melees on
him, but need a second set of healers (who can be outside AoE range, as
opposed to the first set of healers that have to be inside AoE range to CH)
to cover the rampage tank. If you don't keep the RT alive, you're hosed as
Rampage will kill everyone in exactly the order of aggro (huge rampage
range). Goodbye, CH team.

    Yeah, 300 range Rampage is just wacky. He can't melee me here, but he
can rampage me!
