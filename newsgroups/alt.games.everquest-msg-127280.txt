> Hm. As far as I know, STR may be marginally important if you loot lots of
FS
> weapons. Otherwise, the only stat you ought to be looking at is STA.

Once STA is past 100 it is pointless to raise it any further, since there
isn't any negative effects when you are low on stamina.  My Monk has a STA
of 109 and I consistantly fight mob after mob for about 20 minutes while my
STA bar is empty and see no difference with slowing up or any negative
effects.

Like it was mentioned in the other posts, STR is important for a rogue for
better backstabs as well as carrying loot, coin etc.

DEX will allow skills to improve faster and weapons proc more often.  My
monk has about 160 DEX buffed and my weapon (either Wu's Trance Stick or
Stormwood Battle Staff) proc on average of about 4 times a fight, sometimes
more sometimes less (while soloing).

AGI helps with dodge, parry, riposte, etc those types of skills as well as
an increase in AC or HP or both, i forget.  I recently neglicted to get any
AGI gear until recently (level 39 currently), now I am at about 155 buffed
and seen alot more skill ups in dodge, riposte, etc.  I also seem to be
hitting either a little faster, more often, or more dmg now too but not sure
exactly what it is but I do see like the dmg output is more.
