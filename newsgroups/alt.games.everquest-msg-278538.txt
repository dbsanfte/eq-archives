Now this is a straw man arguement - you are assuming that you either solo or 
group exclusively, but thats not the case. Most of the people I know who 
solo do so to kill time while finding a grp, at higher levels the solo exp 
is just slow. You do it but you would rather not - you are just killing 
time.

No arguement there

Here is where we go in different directions Loral. Below you argue that 
there should be a different way for non solo classes to get exp and I agree 
with that - but I completely disagree with the above statement that groups 
should desire every class equally. I just finished a DoN mission as the only 
healer, I had to make sure they knew I had no heal over time, they would 
have to watch agro and we would have to go a bit slower to avoid long sit 
time. That to me is group learning to live with the skills they have with 
them, they have to adjust to the people there. That is group community - 
not - every class should be able to the job equally. That is exactly what 
made me leave EQ2.

They do now - there is no way at higher levels for a solo hunter to get exp 
faster than in a group. I can solo Fire tables but will take a group there 
anytime because the exp is so much better in a group.The mobs go down faster 
and overall there is no comparison. Your arguement fails here.

It is now - I see no reason to change anything so far.

You have set up the straw man and are now taking it down - I disagree with 
the premise that solo is much better exp than grouping.

This is the current situation Loral - there is no way to beat group exp at 
levels above maybe 60. I would taylor my arguement to SOE to levels below 
that, because above that there is no way to beat group exp as the game is 
currently configured.

This is just wrong - it doesnt work in EQ2 and wont work here, in EQ2 you 
put up an lfg and get lots of invites, sure, but they are spam. No - we are 
hunting here, doing this etc - just anon invites.
Its like drive by group invites in EQLive, when was the last time you 
accepted one of those Loral?

Please - if they cant find the group maybe the zone they are fighting in is 
beyond them. I have had invites to groups in new zones and explained first - 
Im new to the zone and may need help - and have either been told they had no 
time or been escorted to group. Much more often been escorted and those are 
the people you remember and who remember you. That is community building - 
not fuzzy yellow trails.

No problem with above, except I think you are hung up on the "perfect"

Please take this as intended Loral - a critique of your opinions on the game 
and nothing personal. I look foward to more DoN missions together.
