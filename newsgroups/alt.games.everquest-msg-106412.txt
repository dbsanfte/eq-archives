Heh, Desmond swore himself blind at me for that about not wanting to
be pictured nudie but I said line up for a photo about 20 billion times
and he didnt put his tunic on so I think he *likes* flexing...

The blue chain is Matchless Dragon, which we used before we got ToV chain
out the wazoo... The dark green is (on me) Forest Stalkers, and on some
others is Runed Scouts or Untamed. Almost all of it is FS now though.

Neither had I ;) Imagine my joy ;)

I know what you mean - I thought my lil druid had been turned into a
porno barby doll by the dopropertinting patch but I've got used
to it now. I think of it more as beach wear ;) 

I have a few pictures of Perl pretending to be a ranger I'll hook out
for you - wood elf druid, dual wielding, plate legs/boots/bracers/gloves/
arms/helm, chain BP ;) Its pretty convincing ;)

Of course, I have a weakness when it comes to wood elf druids in beach
wear, but I'm sure the latest batch of screenshots will tell the story
of that. I'll try to have them up later today ;)
