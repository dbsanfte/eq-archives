For those who might not have seen this site before, 
http://www.mmorpgchart.com tracks subscription numbers for most of the 
current MMORPG's.

The most recent update was interesting because while I expected to see 
EQ1's numbers continue to fall somewhat, I didn't expect such a dip in 
the number of EQ2 subscriptions.  As a matter of fact, EQ2 has just a 
hair larger subscriber base than Star Wars Galaxies which is really sad 
considering it (EQ2) was supposed to be their 'star child'.

Although you might not be able to call EQ2 a flop, it certainly isn't the 
success SoE was hoping it would be (and the reasons for that could 
probably fill an entire seperate thread...).
That being the case, I wonder if they will ultimately divert more 
resources back to EQLive?

Thoughts?
