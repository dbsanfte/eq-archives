One of the good things with velious, no begging, for my lvl 4 and 18
guy it's like having a vacation lol.

Last night in freeport there was this female warrior lvl 2 who whas
running around begging, she got something from a guy and then asked
if he had any more stuff /smack , found her later by the bank begging
away, gee how i hate it, in the mean time i had been whacking rats and
bats and some orc pawns, had gotten my self almost 2pp in loot,
managed to buy my first three songs at once, shure feels better than
to beg for it.

When i played my ogre shaman i took a trip to neriak and was later
killed inside the commons zone, i did run back from oggok without sow
or any buffs other than the ones i had at lvl 4, it works, shure takes
longer but still, i feel bad even asking for a bind in neriak so i
rather run instead :)
