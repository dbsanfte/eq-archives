So you're saying that a Warrior should _always_ be able to taunt?
And thus there should be _no_ place on Norrath where a hybrid tank
can outperform a Warrior?  Then why bother to have a variety of tank
classes? or a variety of dungeons?

Please note that I agree with most of what you've posted to this
thread, but I vehemently disagree with the idea that there shouldn't
be a place or three in EQ where Paladins and Shadowknights are actually
and honestly valuable, valuable in the sense of being _more_ effective
than an equal level Warrior.  Variety is the spice of life. :)

And on the subject of the unbalancing effect of CH, I'm wondering
whether adding something like a 400 mana 2000hp 6-second heal post-50
to the "pure" wis casters wouldn't make the Druid and Shaman more
functional as backup/substitute healers in high end encounters.  This
would not change the fact that the Cleric is the undisputed premier
healer in the game, especially since they would presumably get the
new spell at a lower level than Druid/Shaman and thus be slightly
more efficient with it (fewer fizzles).  At 6 seconds the casting
time would fall into the modifiable range for the Mage focus items so
maybe it would have to be slightly longer to avoid creating a new set
of encounter balance issues.  I've long wondered why, given the huge
number of hp post-50 tanks have when buffed, there isn't a healing
spell substantially larger than Sup. Heal available to the Priest
classes.
