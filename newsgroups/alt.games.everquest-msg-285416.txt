I think you misunderstand the relationship between mage and wizard nuke
damage.

Yes, mages can drop the big fire boom, but up against fire resistant
stuff(which is usually also heavily magic resistant, and suddenly all
they have is a pet. and some minor DS's

Wizards have big booms in every flavour, as well as Lures.  mages don't
get lure based spells, and don't get variety.  also, wizards can do
slightly higher nuke damage per mana bar.
