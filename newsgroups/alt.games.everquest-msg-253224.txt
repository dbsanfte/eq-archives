I just don't get how anyone can figure they have a chance with a chick
over an online computer game.

I mean.. just.. it... I... uh... how? 

I've played female characters; my 65 cleric was created as female
because, darnit, I certainly would rather be healed by a cute little
elf than a slobby looking dwarf. Of course, once you're in the game
and high enough to realize that rarely do people even roleplay, it's a
tad difficult to reroll the character accordingly.

Myself, I never once "came on" to people as the female characters I
used; I simply have no interest in that sort of thing. If anyone (and
it has happened more times than I can count) actually tried hitting on
-me-, and not the -character-, I would simply accept whatever
compliment and not encourage any more -- that usually ended it right
there. Just show that you have no interest in pursuing any sort of
"online relationships" (what a dirty phrase).
