Well... there are a lot of combos I'm fond of.

Necromancer/Druid. -Godly damage, ports, SOW, regen for the Necromancer when
they start using those HP-Mana spells, and in areas where you can't Fear
kite, the Druid can keep the Necro pet alive with buffs, DSes, etc.

Necromancer/Ranger. -Pretty much same except as the Druid except it's more
melee reliant... Ranger heals aren't exactly the best, but it would pretty
much help a Necro save mana on leeches.

Necromancer/Rogue. -...This is getting redundant... Fear kiting, BS,
emergency heals.

Shadow Knight/Paladin. -Nice damage, emergency heals, a -form- of crowd
control from the Paladin (Root)

Shadow Knight/Ranger. -Fear kiting... SOW, damage, etc...

Enchanter/Ranger. -SOW from the Ranger, Clarity and Haste on the Ranger (a
Ranger with 60% Haste is pretty nice...) and it's basically Fear kiting.
Since the Enchanter can DOT-debuff it also turns the Ranger into meat
grinders.

Cleric/Warrior. -Slash, slash, slash, Bash, heal. If you wanted to, you
could even Fear kite! <Gasp> That only works with Dark Elf Clerics, though.
Overall, probably the most simple of all of the combos... but pretty
effective. (Just a bit slow)

Shaman/Monk. -Good god, this is uber. Tons of buffs on the Monk, heals,
Haste, insane damage output, Slows...this is a hard combo to beat.


Of course, I know I skipped over a few... but you can really just use a
little logic to think of the rest. Cleric/-Melee- will pretty much be a good
combo (except in the case of Rogues).

And before someone mentions my Ranger bias, my main is a Shadow Knight so I
don't have any more reason to make them seem superior to the rest... they
just happen to be very good when they don't get hit a lot. -It's hard being
one of the only people that likes Rangers... :b
