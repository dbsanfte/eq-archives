umm  Kunark wasn't this bad.  Not 12 hours after launch and patch
still jammed.   They really shoulda left the patcher up during the
patch, so at least folks could be partial patches and stuff and not
have it jammed.  

hell I tried earlier and couldn't even get th epatcher prepatch to
connect, and its just downloading a 1K file telling it to go on.
Unacceptable.
