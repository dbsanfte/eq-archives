Nah not really. But nice thought. If you're gonna bash DragonLance please
come up with a better arguement or "dig".

Tolkein works and the DragonLance saga are two totally different stories
and characters. As for someone who played DnD avidly as a child I'd have
to say they are a great read. Someone who has not and prefers a more
"intellectual" read would like the Rings. Do you see the difference???

Why are you comparing? Who cares? Apples and oranges???
