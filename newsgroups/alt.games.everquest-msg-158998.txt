    If you weren't trained, you could kill stuff. Resists are slightly high
because of the level of the mobs, and some mobs are casters, but other than
that they're very killable. Any strategy that involves tanking really
requires a slower, and we found (unsurprisingly) that in PoD Disease-based
stuff was very hard to land.

    No "no movement change" things that I saw - everything was snareable,
everything I tried to root was rootable (after a few tries). Stunnable
depends on level, but stuff near zone-in should be fine.

    Jazz, it'll all depend on how often you're trained. It's that bad.
