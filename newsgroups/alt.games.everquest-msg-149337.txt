?!?  I agree with your theory on mend.  I don't announce when it's up and I
rarely use it.  It's my "last chance" after everything else has gone wrong. 
It's my "Casting CH on Faned" ...  that's gonna land about 2 seconds too
late, get out of jail free card.

But don't heal when FD?  Would you rather the cleric wait until I stand up
so they can transfer all my aggro to them?

I know some clerics that think like this.  I know quite a few that used to
think like this and got over it.
