You expected him to be happy about it?

Even aside from his understandable disappointment due
to being betrayed by someone he trusted, there was
another point to his followup that you missed:  Even
though he had immediately changed his password after
lending out his character for a one-time event, the
scumbag still managed to steal his stuff *later* because
he changed the "account contact" info during the short
time he had access to the account.

In this post "u89s" is warning us about this type of danger
so that if anyone lends (or has lent) their character
info out at any time (even in the past), they'd better
double-check the account contact info to make sure
they're not vulnerable to this type of future rip-off.
