wow, what an utterly ignorant post.  what side of the road do you drive on?
huh? wha?  if in england i'm driving on the left side.

again, you must think that all people think the same and must subscribe to
your way of thinking or the American way - ignorant and foolish.

you've never entered a zone during off hours and have had either no one in
it or perhaps a couple of groups that know what they're doing and don't
train?  I have, many times.  Not everyone plays on Saturday night, eastern
standard time, bud.  Especially people who've had enough of the likes of you
who go ranting and dissing people in shout and ooc.
