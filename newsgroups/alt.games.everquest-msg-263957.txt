Follow-up continuation.. I loved LDoN up until I left. It was a hugely
refreshing change from "sit pull fight sit pull fight" in a static
spot. Some people think instancing kills immersion, but, frankly, I
think 50 people in a single dungeon fighting over spawns does FAR more
damage to immersion. Just doesn't seem reasonable to me to have a
world with adventurers practically tripping over each other everywhere
they go. It also helped immersion, IMO, that the dungeon didn't
magically refill after you got to the end.

LDoN kept you moving in more goal-oriented hunting. Possibly there
were flaws in implementation, but, overall, LDoN was one of my
favorites.
