Even though my character is level 8 I am having fun sneaking up behind mobs 
under stealth and pouncing on them with high damage lunges.

I started a Freeport  woodelf scout, will go Predator at level 10 and then 
Assasin at 20. Am I right to assume this is the best choice for good old 
fashioned "sneak up on peeps and jump on them from concealment" type rogue?

PS - one thing that confused me in case anyone else starts a scout: you 
don't dual wield 2 * 1 hander weapons. A one hander is used in one hand only 
with a sheild or what have you in the second hand. You need to find 2 
weapons that are specifically labled of  "dual wield" style type.

But once you 2 * dual wield daggers going with a delay of 1.2 each they sure 
do make a kitchen wizz job of a mob... even if your only hitting for one and 
two damage for a non special hit it adds up damn fast.
