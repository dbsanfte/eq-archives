Except in the case of Sebilis .. Ten minutes before the servers came down,
and after 3 hours of being there (A decent chunk of it spent on CR) we went
away with about 200pp cash, 6 Fire Opals, 1 Fire Emerald, 1 Sapphire, 2 Star
Rubies, Spell: Yaulp IV, Spell: Pillar of Frost, Elder Spiritist's Helm, and
Mrylokar's Vambraces. I love Sebilis. =)
