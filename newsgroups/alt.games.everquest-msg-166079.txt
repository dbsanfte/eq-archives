As my warrior has increased in level I have been doing some shopping in the
Bazaar.  I have found some very nice armor pieces that have good str and sta
bonuses but also cause you to lose some cha points.  Since my guy is a
warrior does it really mater if my cha gets extremely low while wearing this
armor?  If I absolutely must deal with a vendor then I take the armor off
and store it away until I am done buying stuff.  Will having a very low cha
cause me to become KOS to npcs like guards and such?  I mean the dwarves in
Butcherblock con as an Ally to me so if I went there and had like a zero cha
would they then attack me?

Thanks in advance for any help with this question.
