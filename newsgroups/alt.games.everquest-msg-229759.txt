However good/bad EQ turns out to be I think I am going to wait a couple
years after it is released before I jump in full steam and play this game.
There are many titles on console that I want to check out, let alone the
handful on PC that are worth a look as well. EQ is too time consuming as it
is. I think there will be a good majority of EQ players who have been here
since beta who will jump at the opportunity of something new and familar to
explore, yet on the other hand by the time it is released there will be a
number of current EQ players who will think that it is another distraction
from becoming the best of the best.
