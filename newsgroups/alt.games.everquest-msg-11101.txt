/safelock is probably useful for people who don't feed their cats....for
days <G>.

I have never left corpses lying around unlooted (beyond res, etc).  I have
never (nor probably ever will) understand why people leave corpses lying
around.  They have given ample warning about this and I look foreward to
reading new threads concerning players griping about lost corpses.

I love the way Verant talks down to us (eg, Runnyeye).  They once said, as
an example, Trumpy Irontoe went on vacation when folks were farming that
quest for too much xp, instead of just saying, *up front*: people are
gaining too much xp from that quest and we've disabled him until we fix it.

They should just say "we retooled Runnyeye because it's been underutilized
for over a year as everyone knows." /yawn
