Anyone know how to get the baby dragon ?  

And is there any truth to the rumour that you also get a statue for
your house ?

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
