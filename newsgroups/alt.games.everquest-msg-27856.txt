(Channelling Rosewhite, halfling druid)

The story the Stormreapers tell is that, before the Ages of Chaos, there was a lovely
zone just north of Surefall Glade, the Jaggedpine Forest, where stood the druid ring
for western Antonica. During the evil times, when Bertoxxulous first came to
challenge Karana and Rodcet Nife, the Forest was so polluted by the Plague Lord that
the Order of Life sealed off the zone forever, lest its corruption further poison the
land. Cut off from the rest of the ancient travel Rings, the once mighty kingdom of
Qeynos began to slip in to decline.
