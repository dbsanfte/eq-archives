I understand not to do it.. but Frenzy is the reason why, you can't suggest
that frenzy doesn't exist.

I find Frenzy is not a major factor while snare/nuke kiting, but it -can- be
one
while root/dot ing.  That mob is stationary, and you can't conveniently
move him over if you spot a wanderer coming.  At 29, heck, you can't even
spot the wanderer at all if you are taking advantage of the root to med.
