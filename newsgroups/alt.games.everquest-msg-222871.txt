But it's wrong to side with ANOTHER country. If you need to revolt, do
it. That's patriotism. Siding with another country? Treason. BIG
difference. And fairly disingenuous of you to try to twist what
Faendar said.

Ahh... the "Bush is stupid" argument. How many stupid Harvard MBSa do
YOU know? is the man a genius? Probably not. Does he have good common
sense? Absolutely. Has he  screwed up enough to have learned from his
mistakes? I'd proably say yes, but that's a judgement call. Is he
stupid? Absolutely not. But then again, the Democrats were calling
Reagan stupid when he was in office, so this comes as no surprise to
me. Also, the "elite press" (wow... Peter jennings and Tom Brokaw can
read off of a TELEPROMPTER! What a pair of Einsteins!) stated that the
voters in California just weren't "smart enough" to vote correctly in
the recall election. Hmmm... so anyone who disagrees with the left is
immediately labellled as "stupid." 

Oh, and I have contended more than once that Clinton was probably one
of the smartest Presidents we've had in the last century. Look at what
THAT got us...

Oh, so now he's a terrorrist? Puh-Leeze! You're laying it on a little
thinck there skippy. Better go take your lithium.
