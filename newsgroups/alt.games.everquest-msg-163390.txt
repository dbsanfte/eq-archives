Yes indeed.  I think this is only for melee skills, but its been that way
forever, my first cleric (abandoned at least two years ago) literally dumped
over 75 points into 2hb when she suddenly acquired an unbelieveably uber 2hb
and decided to try becoming a battlecleric.  That Drakkal Icegrinder was a
thing of beauty to a level 44 cleric!  (braces for the hail of derisive
laughter) and there was literally no imaginable use for all those points
anyway  (this was before the addition of quests that meant learning every
single trade skill was at least an interesting plan)

At any rate, yes, I did just spend 10 points going from 155 to 165 bash, so its
still usable that high. Saved me eons of bashing every mob as often as possible
to get the skill capped... now I just do it for the morsel of added DPS, but on
caster mobs I know I have my best possible chance of scoring bash interrupts.
