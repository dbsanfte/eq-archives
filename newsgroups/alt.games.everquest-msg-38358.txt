I like trying to help people who run into problems that I may have
already encountered. But I can't help you. Why? Because I don't know
what problem you're having. Why? Because until you buy a keyboard with a
shift key and some punctuation, I can't read your posts without my eyes
trying to leap out of my head. A couple typos is one thing, but man....
are you just doing that to try to be "kewl" or "unique" or something?
It's irritating as all shit.
