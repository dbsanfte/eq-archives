Check me on this, you're not having fun now?  Why in the world are you
playing a game where you seem to need to put a year's work into the
game before you can "really start having fun"?

5 years.  If you've been grinding your way simply to get to 65 so that
*then* you can start having fun, I really wonder about you.
