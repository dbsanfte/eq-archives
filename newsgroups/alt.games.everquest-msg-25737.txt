There is an alternative quest that can be done to get the fish, though it adds
time to doing the stien quest it also save you from the massive faction hit. )
This info was located on Allakhazam's web site.






The Ak'Anon zoo keeper, Kimble Nogflop will give you a regurgatonic if you bring
him a flask of nitrates. You can get the nitrates from Gerael Woodone in
Surefall Glades.

Give Kimble the flask and you get you get experience and faction; +GemChoppers,
+MerchantsofAkAnon, +KingAkAnon, -DarkReflection.

He then gives you the regurgatonic, and says to give it to "who may need it and
they will surely cough up whatever may be inside them with no harm to them
whatsoever."

One known use for this is to give it to frostbite the dog to get him to cough up
the koalindl fish, which is needed in several quests (most notably the stein of
mogguk quest).

fishing village, though he sometimes goes off roaming the zone>
