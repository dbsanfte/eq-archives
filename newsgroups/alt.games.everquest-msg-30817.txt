    It also sounds like it would be dangerous, as with three you have
exactly enough time for ONE re-mez attempt if you get a resist. I learned a
long time ago not to sit beside a bard-mezzed mob. ;-) How ARE bard resists
on mez, anyways? Is there time to Occlusion if you get a resist? Once a mob
breaks mez, other than tanking what sorts of defenses do you have (ENCH can
AoE stun, for example)?

    In my experiences, once we hit three parked mobs the bard stops singing
anything other than mez. Even at two mobs, they usually drop one of the mana
songs. Look at how much mana you give with those - it HURTS when those stop.

    How does a bard pick up on pulses? Is it visual, a text message, just
"know" the timing?

    That meshes with my experiences.

    You're thinking like a bard - they don't HAVE to do it all at the same
time. ;-) Dazzle lasts a long time, haste has a fair duration (and is
right-clickable if you have epic), slows need only be applied as mobs are
killed. Add in ToT, and it takes a REAL disaster to see an enchanter go OOM
before they die.

    There's the other thing that can stop a bard from being a capable ENCH:
the desire to do damage. An enchanter never worries that they aren't doing
any damage. Lots of bards do.

    Ah, so that explains the twitching I see the mobs do - a combination of
mez moving them, and breaking out of mez for very short periods.
