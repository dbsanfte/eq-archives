ROFL, I didnt say minor characters twinked by them, all these were twinks
from my level 60 DE/Cleric... hahah  fewlio, making assumptions that are
incorrect..  As you saw, the Wizard has most of his shit minus the planar,
but has over 200 INT and high MR which is boss on TZ.. and this isnt a
"blue" server either... hahah some people are really sad. :)

Oh and im selling because im tired of this game.. and not for DaoC.. I
bought it, played one night, realized it was an EQ Clone, and took it back
to EB... I really dont care for MMORPG's anymore.. been playing EQ Since
beta, and played Meridian 59, and others before that... just burned on the
same "Fantasy/Medieval" game.. even Anarchy Online isnt fun anymore.. BTW, I
have an account on there too if anyone wants it :)
