I was asking a question to get some common ground.
It wasn't meant to be an accusation.

It seems we agree on that.

One that you seem to have trouble grasping, as we
shall see.

Look what I found;
http://groups.google.com/groups?q=g:thl159203649d&dq=&hl=en&lr=&selm=39a9ca3c.821879179%40news.mindspring.com

This is you replying to someone who has you
killfiled. And, its not the only one. At one point
you even beg to be quoted, so that the killfiler
will see your post.

I guess this makes you stupid, idiotic, foolish
and your post pointless, doesn't it?

Or does that only apply to other people, like your
ethics?
