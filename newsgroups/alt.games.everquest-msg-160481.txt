The HQ hides are used to make 10 slot backpacks, which on my server sell 
for 70pp or so, so getting 150pp each is just plain stupid to aim for.
Usually 30-40pp for HQ
150-400 for supert (for studded acrylia armor, worse armor, but more 
people can make, so easier to sell the hides, might explain the high 
prices).
150-200 for Flawless.
