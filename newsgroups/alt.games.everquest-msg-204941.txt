And ya know, I enjoy the hell out of dissing hypocritical morons like

you.  When nimrods like you do something obnoxious in public, as in
Bebinn's example of some dumbass cybering via /say or /em, you are
the fuckwit trying to "impose their morals".  So you can take that
pathetic line of shit and 10 pounds of sand and ram it where the sun
don't shine you sniveling self-righteous putrid pile of stinking
manure.
