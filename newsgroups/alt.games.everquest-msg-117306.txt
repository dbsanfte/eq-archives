I am not disagreeing with any of your reasons.


I WANT A TIME LIMIT SERVER.


There are over 30 servers now and I am sure there will be a bunch of
servers in EQ2.  I am asking for one server with a time limit.  If no
one plays then they remove the time limit.  If you do not like the
time limit play on another server.

You might not play on that server but I bet it will not be the least
populated server.
