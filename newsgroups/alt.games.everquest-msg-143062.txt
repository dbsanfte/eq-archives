Yeah, they would, sorry.

Rephrased:  "So we get silly arguments like full-automatic weapons and
Teflon-coated bullets in the hands of a VERY small segment of the
population are enough to stop a government with control of F-15SEs,
Apache helicopters, and M1A1/2 Abrams main battle tanks, and the
willpower to use them.  Therefore, legislation to help keep those weapons
out of the hands of mentally unstable children or criminals isn't worth
the potential risk to our freedom."

There, that better?  ;)
