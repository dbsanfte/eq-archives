We're not completely ruling out the new x800, or even the 9800 Pro.  Soon
the 9800 Pro will be a really good card for a *good* price, but it's
just...the x800 is twice as fast.  *paws longlingly at the x800 or nvidia
6800*  In the end it will probably come down to price, and we've seen the
low end 6800s for just over $300, but nothing so low yet for x800.
