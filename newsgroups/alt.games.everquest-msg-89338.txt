I can atest to this as well. I joined a group of friends in RM one time
and asked them how the loot was going and they all complained that Verant
'must' have nerfed the giant spawn because they were geting very
few giants. I do a /who all and see there are about 20 people in the zone,
hmm, then I look around and see about 30 trash mobs walking around the hill.
"Hey guys lets take out the trash and see if the giants spawn  more" So
we begin a whole sale slaughter and Lo and Behold more giants start
popping! =)

It may have been a coincidence but it at least passed the time between
HG waves if it didn't. Besides those lizards drop bronze weapons. I am
a loot whore and sell everything. With charsima gear and buying and
selling items to the vendors in the zone to convert the copper up I bet
I make 10-15% more money than most people.
