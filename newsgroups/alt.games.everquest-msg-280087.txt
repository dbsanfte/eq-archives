It is a huge time sink for the pitiful Cleric.
And it isnt a "huge" timesaver,600 mana is nothing today,especially on
a raid with lots of classes which have buffs which help in one way or
the other to regain mana.
Talking about wipes,doing the PoP progression lately up to being
elemental flagged,we wiped exactly twice on all the raids,and this was
on RZ,cleric epic wouldnt have made any difference in this case.
