('shiek' = 'chic'?)

Designing a good game requires FAR more than polling players. Poll some 
kids about whether they like going down snakes in snakes and ladders. 
After reading that: should we remove the snakes?

Players don't like long boring travel... but players don't like feeling 
like they're selecting levels in Crash Bandicoot either.

The old travel system sucked. The new travel system sucks too. Something 
in between might not suck. The firepots for example didn't suck. 
Teleporting wizards and druids didn't suck. The spires didn't suck 
*that* bad... although it should have been possible to bind at the other 
side... because pre-soul binders it did suck to spire down, die half 
ways to somewhere, and then wait 15 minutes for another spire down 
before you could even start the CR...

The portal rings in AC for example were pretty well thought out, and 
didn't suck, as an example of a better (in my opinion) system than 
either that EQ tried.
