Given that a buck a month increase, for continuous zone revamps adds 
value to the product, and is more profitable than an exapansion it makes 
a lot of sense to do it. They can't really push more expansions on us 
any faster without meeting ever higher resistance... so this is a new 
way of getting in our pockets.

What short term drop in profits? They up it by a buck and start doing 
revamps. Profits go up. How many people do you think will cancel their 
account over a dollar/month for revamps? 

And bear in mind that they raised it $3 last time, with no value add to 
us at all.

And this effectively lets them squeeze one more expansions worth of 
content out per year, with 100% buy in.
