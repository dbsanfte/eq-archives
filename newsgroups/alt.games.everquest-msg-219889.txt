The first rule of online game design.   Never trust the client.  The client
is in the hands of the enemy.

They followed that rule... all information is stored serverside.   If you
deactivate your account, they guarentee they will hold your character data
for at least 6 months.   But they have never deleted a character yet.   I
cancelled for a year, completely uninstalled, and came back to find
everything as I left it.
