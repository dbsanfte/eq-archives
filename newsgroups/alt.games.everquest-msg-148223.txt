That's a pretty big call. That's an absolute huge call actually. Methinks I
smell bias...

There are many civilised cultures who have not survived at all and not one
"civilised" culture at all has had an easy run of it. History is *fucking*
barbaric. The only thing that seperates some cultures from others is the
records they left us with and the popularity of those records in modern
time.

BTW, no-one left records saying what utter pricks they were and how nice
everyone else was. I have read the old testament and it read to me that the
Hebrews kicked ass just as often as they had their own kicked.
