The difference is, then, that Paladins are schooled in the methods and
techniques of a cleric.  A druid or shaman are not, even if some of the
lower techniques are the same.  This isn't so much about whether or not a
paladin should get the new spells, but rather a question of the nature of a
paladin.  I object to the idea that we are simply an amalgam of warrior and
cleric.  We are clerics in our own right.
