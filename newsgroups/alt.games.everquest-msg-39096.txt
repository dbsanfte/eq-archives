Bah, that's the one thing I was very glad to see EQ not bring with it
from the old MUD's from which it sprang.  I always thought level
limits on equipment was the absolute worst violation of the fiction I
could find.  It's a sword, for cryin' out loud.  Magic or not, it's
still a shaped bar of metal with which you whack things about the
head.  It's not rocket surgery  :)

I'd much rather see twinking any day.  Course, I'm not bothered by
others twinking.  I wish I had a character high enough I could do it
myself.  :)
