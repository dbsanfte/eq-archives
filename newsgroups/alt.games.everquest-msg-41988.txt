I know that faction is very important on the velious continent (moreso than
anywhere else in the game).  But I'm having trouble finding information on
it.  I've hesitating adventuring much there because I'm not sure who I
should and should not attack and for what reasons.  Can anyone point me in
the direction of some good solid information on Velious factions and/or give
me a rundown?

Best Regards
