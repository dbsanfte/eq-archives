I'm sure they are feeling some pressure, but I can't imagine that it is too
overwhelming.  Rogues asked to be fixed for a year and Shaman's asked for a
working Alchemy skill for about 18 months, and Verant did eventually
capitulate long before the threat of DAOC.  Besides, I doubt that a European
server would prevent anyone who is planning on switching to DAOC from
switching anyway.
