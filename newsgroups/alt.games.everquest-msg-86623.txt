DAoc is currently pretty deficient in the dungeon department, but it
does well in the outdoor department.  I did some measurements when
bored one weekend.

Basing the measurements on normal unbuffed running speed in both
games, most DAoC outside areas have an area in the 60-64 square units
range.  Each Realm has 10 of these large areas in the homeland, and 4
of them in the frontier.

That gives DAoC the following outdoor world size:

	Your homeland:  600
	Your Realm:     840
	Reachable:     1320
	World:         2520

"Reachable" is your homeland, your frontier, and the two enemy
frontiers.

Here are the sizes of outdoor EQ zones in Antonica:

    48.1    South Karana
    22.5    North Karana
    15.0    East Karana
    51.6    West Karana
     7.2    Qeynos Hills
    17.1    Everfrost
    10.0    Lake Rathetear
    16.9    Rathe Mountains
    11.3    The Feerott
     7.3    Innothule Swamp
     7.2    Southern Desert of Ro
     7.3    Oasis of Marr
     8.3    Northern Desert of Ro
     9.4    East Commonlands
     7.8    Nektulos Forest
     7.5    West Commonlands
    10.9    Kithicor Forest
     4.7    Lavastorm Mountains
     5.6    Misty Thicket

This gives Antonica a total outdoor size of 275.7.

Anyone want to do the other continents?  The scale on the EQ side is 1
unit on my scale equals 40 on the /loc scale, so you can get the areas
on my scale from any good map, if you don't want to run around the
zone yourself. :-)

Anyway, based on this, and rough guesses for the rest of the EQ
continents, I'd say DAoC's outside area compares well to pre-Velious
EQ.
