How specifically do I install the Trilogy Expansion over my original
Everquest? I do not want to lose my characters. Do i have to be
on-line when I stick in the CDs? The instruction book that comes with
it assumes it is a fresh install, and not that anyone is "writing
over" the original.... Any help?
