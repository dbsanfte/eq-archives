There are many Deluxe Sewing Kits on the Servers only players have them
though. May cost you up to100p. Most towns have a public Loom (10 slot) some
where and you can use it, if you don't want to spend the money or can't find
a deluxe kit. Verant in there infinite wisdom made all sewing kits a deluxe
kit then nerfed the Vendors back to regular kits.
