Check your clip plane setting. On one of my characters/accounts the first
time I logged in after the patch I had the clip plane reset to 0. It was a
character I had not used in a while, but I know before the patch I used
another character on that account/computer and had the clip plane at around
50%. Is the clip plane set by character or account or computer???
