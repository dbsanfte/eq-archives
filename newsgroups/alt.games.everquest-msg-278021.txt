Actually, it is you who are missing the point. PvP can be kept on other 
servers. Sales of in-game items cannot. PvP is not a detriment to the 
game. It is merely a matter of preference. Their establishment of 
item/coin sales is an endorsement of the very practice itself, which 
will only spur the growth of that same practice on other servers as 
well. Many who refrained from doing it before out of principle now see 
SoE themselves coming out and declaring that it is not a bad thing for 
the game after all. Many who did it discreetly before will now feel even 
more inclined to do so.

Case law discussion are like teets on a boar at this point. They mean 
nothing until SoE decides to pursue the option. I see no reason to think 
they will suddenly decide to do so when they never have before.

It *is* undeniable. They have endorsed the practice. They have now 
officially reversed their long-time stance that sales of in-game items 
are bad for the game. That's a green light to many people who declined 
to do so in the past out of principle. After all, now they can view it 
as something that must not be bad for the game after all.

So, again, why would they try it now? Even if they changed the wording 
in the EULA, it would only take them so far in a court of law. I've 
never heard of an iron-clad EULA.

Same difference, except they can't keep it off the primary servers. Do 
you really thing all those who want to buy items are going to flock to 
the Exchange servers? Get real. They will need a market, and it will be 
there as always.
