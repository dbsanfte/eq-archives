I tested this over a year ago on a level 12 Necro. I gave the pet a Sporali
Defender Blade which was 17damage 37 delay and it did not hit any slower but
of course was kicking ass with the extra damage. So at lower levels you try
to give the pet a high damage weapon, forget about the delay (unless this
has changed recently) as this does not come into it. I only took this necro
to level 20 so never found out what complications occur during the
transition to dual weild.

Presently at 55 I notice no difference whether the Gimp has weapons or not
apart from the type of damage he does, ie, blunt, slashing or peircing. The
amounts stay the same though so I only give him weapons for vanity if they
would otherwise rot or I want him to use the proc, ie, stun from a Gnoll
Hide Lariat.
