I'll bet your account got hacked by some punk who toyed with your account.
Maybe it's just a complete mistake.  Just be patient and try to call
tomorrow.  I have a friend who got in the same predicament and it turned out
that his name was very close to the name of the actual offender and his
account got pulled up as a result.

Good luck.
