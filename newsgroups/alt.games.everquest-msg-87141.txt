Ah, and this is what differs gate-casters from port-casters. You can hop
around the world no prob, but other casters can't. For us non-porters
binding in the nexus is the smartest choise because of the extra ports we
get besides the obvious advantages of loading time and the Bazaar.
If I was a wizard I would probably keep my binds in Luclin almost at all
times. Nexus port only works there and the Norrath ports work anywhere.

90 minute spawn. I got 3 packs already and a guildie about 6. He's VERY
predictable and there are nice things to kill around there to pass the time.

As another sidenote: I have a guildmule on my second account who is
stationed in The Bazaar. The lack of encumberance penalties and easy
accessability make it a good spot for him. If I went on a raid with my guild
I usually have some cash and items to hand over to a guildmule. Haveing one
at my bindspot simplifies that.
