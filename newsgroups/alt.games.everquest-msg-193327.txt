Sorry, but I can not find a clear explanation[1] of what Fear Kiting is
and how to do it. Character/class of interest is as a bard in early
30's.

Also interested in charm kiting as well.


[1] Even when I eventually find someone's describing fear kiting, they
tend to use EQ jargon and I'm lost as to which songs they are actually
using.
