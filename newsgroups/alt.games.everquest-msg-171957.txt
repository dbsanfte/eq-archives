 I don't delete pain in the ass keys either. I deleted all my ToFS keys
along with Seb and HS and a few others. But I still have VP and ST in
the bank. Not that we've been to VP in over a year now. Actually I don't
think I have VP on my keyring due to that reason. Even if I did I
wouldn't delete it. A couple spots in the bank is a small price to pay
for now having to do some pain in the ass quest if you need a new one.

 Good luck. I know of someone who has VP items and somehow his key
poofed. Verant wouldn't reimburse him a new key.
