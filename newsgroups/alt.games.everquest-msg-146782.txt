No, my argument is that druids and shaman are viable group
healers now at higher-levels.  Very few XP groups need a
cleric:  they take one either for the extra healing or for
the rez capability.

Assuming the healing power is "balanced" by giving them their
versions of CHeal, that means the only extra thing clerics
offer is rez capability.  That's the same problem druids say
they have:  we can port, but people buy ports to and from a
zone, it doesn't get groups.   After the change, people can
still buy rezzes (or just get them for free.)

Part of the balance was supposed to be the extra damage a
cleric could deal, but that doesn't go in until 56.  Assuming
the heals go in at 54, that leaves 54 and 55 unbalanced.  So
it should be fixed.

The only spell in the game currently that would make a big
difference at 54 is UHoF.  And, it's a DoT now, and DoTs aren't
group efficient, especially from a healer.  MoR is 54 as well,
but they'd have to give it a huge boost (unbalancing tons of
encounters) to make it sufficiently better than a druid's
damage shield.  Making UHoF persistent gives them some balance.

I don't care what they do to ensure the balance is still there
at those levels, but they should do something, even if it's
just moving the new heals to be level 56, which is where the
cleric changes take place.

Seriously:  a 54 cleric doesn't have the "good" rez yet, so
that's not a factor.  The ONLY thing they do have is better
healing.  If you make that a non-factor, what's left to get
clerics a group until they hit 56 and get both the 'good' rez
and the melee changes?

The changes to "fight higher mobs" might help, but those camps
are far more likely to be filled with 56+ cleric-based groups
than by 54 and 55 clerics.  After all, it's harder mobs, you'll
want a rez available, and NOT the 90% rez.
