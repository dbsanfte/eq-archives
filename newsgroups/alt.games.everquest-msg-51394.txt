I love this topic.

This is actually germaine to something happening in my guild at the
moment.  Level 45 warrior who'd been a guild leader last year was
sent out in the boonies in the army.  He gave most of his equipment
away to guildees so it wouldn't go to waste, and all of his money,
too.  When he logged back on, I believe it took us as a guild about
3 days to get full crafted armor for him (except a SSB from Guk).
We even got him a FBSS and a Yak on the same trip Guk.  In
his primary hand he's weilding a Slime-Coated Harpoon, one of
my old ones.  I think the only expense involved has been the gems
for the crafted armor quest.

Of course, we did it WITH him as a guild, so the solo part doesn't
really supply.  But  nobody was really out of pocket much, because
on our raids for quest pieces, we generally looted enough money
in coin/items to make back for the gems.

All in all, a good time.  Our guild is hardly uber, but very dedicated
to it's members.  I would think at 51 and with a good crowd like
Jakugg runs with, he'd have an easy time getting back up  to his
normal level-appropriate gear.  Who would refuse help from
friends in this situation?
