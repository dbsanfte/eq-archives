By spamming the original poster's email address in the body of the post,
he's made it easy for spambots to look through the newsgroup archives and
add his email address to their spam lists.  He's basically made it a
certainty that "zachary44" gets put onto every spammer's list of addresses.

Which is no less than he deserves.  =)
