Nothing at all.. in fact that is how I do request a group... so you
complaint isn't about someone using channels to get a group, it is
using just the shout.  I agree with you on that... and yeah I can read
and saw it up there in your message, I guess I got in the Kleenex
trap...   or Coke trap...  You said Shout, and I "assumed" you ment a
broadcast channel, any broadcast channel..    
(kleenex or coke trap.....   can you give me kleenex yet that is a
name brand,....or how bout... can you make me a xerox of that paper,
when your copier is a minolta)

just general discussions

I have use LFG on all my characters... and to this date, I can count 4
total times that the LFG tag is the reason I got a group.... all other
groups I have gotten because of reputation, or my OOC message.
