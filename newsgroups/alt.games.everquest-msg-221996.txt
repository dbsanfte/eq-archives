I think someone else got it right.  Take the chance of making 10 in a row on
the first 10 (.5^10) then subtract that from 1 to find the chance to not
make 10 in a row on the first 10.  Then raise that to the 91'st power to
find the chance to not make 10 in a row in 91 sets in a row.  Then subtract
that from 1 to find the chance to make 10 in a row on one of those sets.
1-(1-.5^10)^91 = 8.5%
I'd guess that there is probably a simpler algorithm out of a stat text but
this calc makes sense to me.
