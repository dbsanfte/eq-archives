    You're missing my point. At level 10 people aren't playing the sit-down
healer, the crowd control ENCH, the only-slows-and-buffs Shaman, and so on.
*Everyone* still gets up and fights, especially the priest classes, which
have a 5xLevel cap on Offense and a 4xLevel+4 cap on weapon skills. Since
almost none of the classes HAVE all the neat tank abilities like double
attack, or dual wield (yeah, monks - I did say "almost none" :-P), or
Riposte at that point having a cleric melee isn't much different than having
the tank melee. And clerics are balanced at lower level (when they're
soloing in the newbie grounds, or in small groups without class balance) by
being able to take swings and contribute damage, as are shamans and druids.
If you capped Offense that low then you'd be hurting those groups and
players.
