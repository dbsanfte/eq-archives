You might be interested to know that SOE is, in fact, not a Japanese
company.  It is a division of Sony Picture Digital Entertainment,
which is also not a Japanese company, but part of Sony Corporation of
America.  SCoA is a subsidiary of Sony Corporation, which is Japanese,
but there are few or no Japanese involved in the day-to-day activities
of Sony Online Entertainment.

I suppose you'll prefer to keep living in your world of Japanese
conspiracies against your enjoyment of Everquest, though.  We all know
that all changes to Everquest are intended to make customers unhappy
and drive them away, after all.
