   Not really true... my DE cleric looks for the day when she
gets her snare clicky 3 symbol of Innoruuk.  And she does have
two different types of fear, for verse the living and dead.  I
know I'll never be as good a snarer as a ranger or druid, but I
was thinking that when I do get it, I can sic Lenny on the
target, snare it, and fear it to hopefully good effect.  

  Yes, I know you also said solo... but just because I don't play
my cleric as a soloer, doesn't mean others might not to good
effect.
