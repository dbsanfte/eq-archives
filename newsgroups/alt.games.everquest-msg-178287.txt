A penny in your pocket, suitcase in your hand,
They won't get you very far,
Now you're a 21st century man.

Fly across the city, rise above the land,
You can do 'most anything,
Now you're a 21st century man.

Though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow,
You still wander the fields of your sorrow.

One day you're a hero, next day you're a clown,
There's nothing that is in between,
Now you're a 21st century man.

You should be so happy, you should be so glad,
So why are you so lonely, you 21st century man.

You stepped out of a dream believing
Everything was gone,
Return with what you've learnt they'll kiss the ground you walk upon.

Things ain't how you thought they were,
Nothing have you planned,
So pick up your penny and your suitcase,
You're not a 21st century man.

Though you ride on the wheels of tomorrow,
You still wander the fields of your sorrow
21st century man.
