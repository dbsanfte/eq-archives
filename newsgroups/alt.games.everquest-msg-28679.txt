Well I won't go into the merits or ethics or etc or lack of thereof, However

I will say this you are right after High School and college all the Jock are
done with.

They think that they walk 3 inches off the ground, but time comes they are
working dead end jobs like the rest of us.

    When I was in college the biggest jock on campus was dating the
homecoming Queen and had all these foot ball records and held all of these
weightlifting records.

Now flash forward 10 years I have a good job, wife, car, computer, a
collection of Sabres and Daggers that looks like a blacksmith exploded.

and Mr. Jock Strap???????

Oh he is working as a cook for Waffle house, with his "degree" in phys Ed.

and his girlfriend???? the home coming Queen?
She is a elementary school teacher married to an accountant.

So I think that says it all. Nerds of the world WAIT!!!!!!!!
Don't worry about killing the jock with a gun, he will kill himself with his
life and his actions!
