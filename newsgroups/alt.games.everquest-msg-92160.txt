Usenet is a text forum.  It has traditionally been a text forum.  It will 
(hopefully) remain a text forum.  I am currently posting from a Unix 
server using tin, and I can not read HTML.  At home I use Forte's Agent, 
which I have set up to not read HTML.  I have used a number of Unix based 
mail programs, most of them do not deal with HTML well.  
The reasons that I prefer text to HTML is that it's smaller, faster, and 
more secure.  I can access it from any internet-connected computer and not 
need to worry about what application is loaded on the computer.  I am not 
at risk of some asshole posting a recursive-link or other anti-social 
trick and harming my computer.  
Using text I can scan 100 messages easily in the time it takes me to look 
at 20 messages on my guild's ezboard account.  When I was active in 10-12 
high-traffic technical newsgroups, there was no way I could have even 
scanned them using any HTML viewer masquerading as a newsreader.
I suggest that you try using a real newsreader for a week or two (I would 
suggest Free Agent, since it's good and free) and then try going back to 
an abomination like Netscape or Outlook Express and see how slow it seems.  
Learn how to tag stuff for download or just download all bodies (depending 
on how you read) and then wonder how you ever dealt with that annoying 20 
second wait while the post loads, for every post.
