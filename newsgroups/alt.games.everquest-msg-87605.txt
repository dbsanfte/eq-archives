The reason why there isn't a perfect 4 person group is there isn't
enough room for all the specialists needed.  That's why people
are suggesting groups with generalists.

also, remember these folks are mostly new to eq, don't expect
them to soar up to 50+ in no time and start raiding.

I'd definitely go with a non-traditional group with lots of 
generalists over the holy trinity + one other, because that
one slot is just not enough.

Bard, Monk, Druid, Mage is one such group.

or all kitties -

Bard, Shaman, BL, rogue/warrior.

Nice thing about BL pets is how well they
hold aggro.  It's child's play to step out
and let aggro revert to the pet.
