step one
/lfg

Step two: in the LFG field write Have LDoN will travel

Click LFG ON button

Step three: switch to LFP

In the field write LDoN group forming

Click LFP ON button

at the bottom hit the Get Matches button.  Look at the other groups out 
there your level, send them tells asking if they need more DPS and a 
snarer... hmm, you do have snare at 29?  Or is it 34?  DPS is king in 
LDoN, there should be little trouble finding a spot for you.

Back to LFG side.  Start looking at the players your level.  Find plate 
tanks, paladin or SK by preference but Warriors will do.  Get one of 
them to join you.  Find a healer; shaman, druid, cleric, at your level 
it makes little difference which.  See if you can scare up a mezzer, 
enchanter, bard, necro... but with the necro you must ask (innocently 
enough) "do necromancers get mez?"  If they express any doubt, they are 
-not- mezzers; the class is capable of it but most necros don't realize 
that and have no practice at the art.  Now fill remaining slots with 
DPS: wizard, mage, necro, rogue, beastlord, ranger, monk...lots to 
choose from.

The order above is pretty much also the order of importance for you: 
with a tank, healer, and DPS you can do normal level LDoN as a trio if 
you are good, the rest just make things easier.  End up with two healers 
or two tanks?  Not crippling, heck, you -could- do the run with just one 
of each anyway, so what if there's some overlap.

Being group leader is the answer to most problems that the less popular 
classes have with forming groups.  9 out of 10 people don't form groups 
at all.  So they sit around LFG for however long it takes for someone to 
get around to inviting them, perhaps shouting or OOCing about it... but 
still, not forming their own groups.

The LFG tool makes this stuff far easier, and if you make a point of 
picking people from the tool then you'll reward their behavior, 
eventually it gets used more and more; LDoN has been the best thing for 
the tool (and for LFG in general) since the idea was invented.

Splendid
