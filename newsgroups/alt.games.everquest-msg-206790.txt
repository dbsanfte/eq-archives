There's this long-standing preception that chanter slow is horrible compared
to shaman slow.  Generally, chanter slow is 5 percent behind shaman.  So,
the chanter is slowing for 30 pct and the shaman for 35 or so - over the
life of the mob, that's what, ten swings difference?

If your mezz is landing fine, then I agree that Tash isn't  your top
priority.  If you get a resist on one, it's often worth the time to get the
Tash in there - kick off the fast stun, Tash, kick off the second stun, and
mezz.  Remember the first stun lasts 4 seconds (1.5 seconds after your gems
are un-grayed) and the second for six seconds (3.5 seconds after gems
ungray).  It's quite viable to use the first stun to get the second one off,
and the second stun to get another spell off.  Also, remember Tash helps all
magic-based spells, so it helps many caster spells stick, including Snare
and paladin stuns.

Agreed that quickness is being cast constantly - you're going to love
Augmentation at 29, it lasts over twice as long.  Swapping in Breeze is a
good way.  You might not be feeling the pain now, but by the time you're
forty you're going to be swearing at those eight spellgems wishing they were
sixteen. IMHO, animations are for farming spiderling silk.

For me, Debuff is/was usually Cancel Magic or Strip Enchantment if you're
fighting mobs that buff themselves, or your highest Strangle line DoT if
you're not.  (Remember those spells have an AC and ST debuffs; you can
increase your melee's damage output by 5 to 10 percent.  Who cares about the
DoT damage!)  Stat debuffs are generally crap unless you're dueling (there's
nothing more hilarious than mezzing a melee and ST debuffing him until he's
encumbered by the weight of his own armor).
