Ok, Since the last posting I have upgraded much of my enchanter's equipment 
and I'm now happy with much of it. There are still a few bad bits to fill 
in. I'm an Errudite Enchanter, level 33 on FV who spends too much time in 
the Bazzar for my own good. A combination of Jewelery, Spell reserch and 
speculation has let me get a few pp together.

Here is my Magelo : http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=659992

And here is my basic unbuffed info (For those who don't like Magelo)

Level 33
Hp 718, AC 377, Atk 380, Mana 1728
Str 69
Sta 87
Agi 81
Dex 88
Wis 108
Int 234
Cha 120
SVP 29, M 33, D 48, F 28, C 34

Focus : SH2, MP2, ReagenC1 (EE2 On A batfang head that I swap in)
Other : Jeweling geerlock to swap in

I'm looking to spend under 3k per slot atm, Note that this is on FV so 
NoDrop stuff is available.

Going through the slots alphabetically :

Arms : Resplendent Arms
Upgrade? : Transient Arms @ 750pp More Cha, AC and Mana Less Int

Back : Tattered Hide
Upgrade? : I can't think of any :-/

Charm : None
Upgrade? : They all cost too much or give me no benifit so I will leave 
this for now

Chest : Robe of Asylum
Upgrade? : Froglock Bonecaster @ 2500pp More Mana and Saves but loose Int 
and Cha

Ear1 : Shrunken Skull
Ear2 : Bat Skull
Upgrade? : The shrunken skull is good, but I want to swap the Bat Skull.
Ear of Blazing Energy @ ? (I saw one for 100pp once and have never seen it 
again) Swaps Mana for Int
Inlayed Jade hoop @ 500pp Again swaps mana for Int

Face : Diamond Inlayed Fine cut Mask
Upgrade? : Don't really want to loose the SH2 but the options seem to be 
Death mask of Elysians @ 3kpp For AC HP Mana and Cha  or
Mask of secrets @850 for AC Mana Int and Cha

Feet : Clodain Skin Boots
Upgrade? : Can't think of one cheap enough

Finger1 : Feather Ring (Got this for 5pp !)
Finger2 : Fine antique Ring (Don't really want to loose the MP2)
Upgrade? : ? I can't find any ?

Hands : Iksar Skin
Upgrade? : Coldain Skin @3000 For AC Mana HP Int loosing Cha
Or Insidious@1800 for  Int , loosing Cha

Head : Loam Encrusted / BatFang
Upgrade? :Platinum Tiara Gets me EH2 (but can't be used with Batfang) and 
Mana, but looses Int and Cha
Thought Horror Scalp May be nice for Research (yes I do do research)

Legs : Giant Scalemail
Upgrade? : Are there any better for a mid level Enchanter ?

Neck : Stone Bead Choaker (Man this is good for the price (800pp))
Upgrade? : I doubt it

Primary : Ok this sucks hard. Sacrificial Dagger (+5 int Pie 5/21)
Upgrade? :Suggestions please ? I can always swap My Stein of Mogg into 
Primary and get a new secondary instead ?

Range : Annother Bargin Hive Fiend's Brain (got for 1300)
Upgrade? : Unlikely Beat 2AC 30Mana 7Int and 7Cha

Secondary : Stein Of Moggok (Could swap this to Prime)
Upgrade? : Again suggestions please. Note the hint about Shields becomming 
better in the patch after next, also note that searching the Bazzar some 
strange items are flagged as shields.

Sholders : Fur-Lined Cloak
Upgrade? : I could go for an Extended range item like Drachnid Thyxl (ER3) 
1700pp Or just try to go for the next shawl. Loam Encrusted looks like the 
only other option swapping 1 int for 10 mana and some saves

Waist : Braided Cinch Cord
Upgrade? : No end of options here. Most invlolve loosing Int for Mana. Also 
I could get EE2 or SH2 items here. (Drake Scale 150pp or Antique Corset 
500pp)

Wrist1 : Blood weave
Wrist2 : Unkempt Armband of Apathy
Upgrade? : The Unkempt is sweet, but the Bloodweave could go.
Supple Scale looks nice @2500pp or Bracelet of Beauty or Bracelet of 
Quintisecence @3000pp Anything else I should look at ?

I guess that the whole Primary / Secondary mess is the main area of 
consern. One option is to go for a 2HB like Stave of Wit, which I have seen 
for 9000pp and would effectivly replace both items. Still that is a little 
much for my likeing.

So what would you guys do ?

Cheers,

Jim
