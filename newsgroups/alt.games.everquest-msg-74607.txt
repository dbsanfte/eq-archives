I'm in a similar boat.  I recently made it to 24, and went over to EK
to hunt the gnolls.  Well, it's necessary - I have rather bad faction
with Highold Pass guards and I'd rather not have them pouncing on me
should I ever go in there to hunt.

Good exp, good loot.  One death. Ding. Welcome to Level 23.

Go back to NK, regroup.  Killed one yellow griffenne, Welcome to Level
24.

I've been killing yellow and white griffennes all day.  Bad loot, but
very nice exp.
