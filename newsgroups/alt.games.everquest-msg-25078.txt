    No, I imagine this is more of a "he'll respawn in seconds, loot his
corpse, and not really be inconvenienced by any of it" message. Meanwhile,
Lokari has expended mana on this piece of trash and been forced to zone
twice (once to escape a possible XP death). It is pointless to interact with
beggars - just ignore them.
