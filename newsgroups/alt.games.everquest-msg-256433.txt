Of course it does. And I'll thank you not to go to childish insults in
a civilized debate in the future.

The person you quoted said "scuba" doesn't rhyme with "bubba". You
said that it's because it's NOT spelled "scubba", implying that the
extra B caused its pronunciation to differ. So then "scrub" should be
pronounced the same as "scuba", with the OOH.

Please pay attention.
