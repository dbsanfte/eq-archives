All of those are "special attacks" so using one disables the others.
The special attacks have different reset times.  Round kick is particularly
long, if I recall correctly.

Conventional wisdom is that you abandon the the previous skill while working
on the new one, until the new one maxes out for your level.

One reason you might want to keep working on your Kick skill is that
a check is made during an Instill Doubt whether your kick is successful.
It is a requirement that it is succesful for Instill Doubt to trigger.  I think you get
that skill at level 20 or so.

By the way, you can find lots of good monk information at www.monkly-businees.com
