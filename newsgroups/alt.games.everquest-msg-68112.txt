There are a couple of players that post to one of the message boards I
frequent http://pub57.ezboard.com/btheeverquestnewbiezone who had a hand
in writing this guide book, and the second edition of the Kunark
guidebook. 

While yes, there is a lot of info on the web for free (and often more
detailed info at that), I still use my other guidebook for quick
reference, and I still plan on getting the newest guidebook as soon as I
can.
