I nearly fell out of my chair at the 'Bard=Plate tank" comment...

Next time I start playing EQ I'll have to remember to tell the bard to 
offtank my unmezzables.

Also ought to tell the uberguilds to dump all those worthless wizards. 
Can't be of any use to them.

Better tell Lance to stop, he's apparently already lost.

One thing does occur to me however.
You can't win, if you concede defeat before the race begins.

parse outdamaged an entire PARTY after two peeps said they should look 
for someone who was actually playing an effective job combo.
