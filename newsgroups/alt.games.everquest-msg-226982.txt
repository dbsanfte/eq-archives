We're pretty happy with it.  It was in development for a good long time, and
we really tried to think ahead of time about what might be problems and
solve them before they became such.

The main reason for having a base value is so that the single magician on
the raid (last night is the first raid we had more than one magician at in
literally months) doesn't get the magician-only super-duper-blows-em-up-good
item for "1".  :)

There's a schematic for the base values.  +15 to a stat or 100 hp = 10 RP
base value.  +10 to a stat or 75 hp = 7 RP base value.  Less than that is 4
(with a few quest items that will have competition assigned a value of 2). 
Those relative values don't change a lot as you climb the ladder of mobs,
and in the absolute worst case scenario of mudflation you just end up with
everything at a base value of 10 RP and let the bidding start from there.
