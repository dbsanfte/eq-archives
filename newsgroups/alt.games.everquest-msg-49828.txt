how long ago did you do your reading? UO now has a PvP free world (for well
over a year now). What they have done is mirrored the Ultima world so now if
you want PvP you can have it, and if you dont you can be free of it too. The
world of Trammel is PvP free, the world of Fellucca is PvP +. So UO DOES
offer a PvP free situation. Also this proves that OSI *is not* ignorant of
this.
