: Suspicious man attempts to lure young girl into car 
: 
:  Police have released a composite of a suspicious man who allegedly
: attempted to lure a young girl into his car earlier this month.
: 
: On several occasions earlier this March, a suspicious man parked across the
: street from a school bus stop at southwest Alexander and southwest Alicia
: Streets in Aloha tried to lure a 10 year-old girl into his car. 
: 
: He told the girl, "I know your Mom, it�s O.K. to get in my car."
: 
: The suspicious man is described as Hispanic, in his late 20�s to early 30�s
: with a mustache and bushy eyebrows. The girl also said he was wearing a
: white baseball cap.
: 
: The vehicle he was driving is described as a red early to mid 90�s Toyota
: with a narrow black stripe running along the mid-section of the car from
: front to back. Detectives say the narrow stripe is possibly rubber door
: trim.
:

: schools or playgrounds have been reported in the last few weeks in North

: New roadside memorial goes up for slain Tahoe girl
: 
: CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) - After repeated vandalism, a new roadside memorial
: has been installed for a young Lake Tahoe murder victim. 
: 
: With the help of a crane, a 1-ton metal cross went up Saturday near the
: spot where the body of 9-year-old Krystal Steadman was found two years ago.
: The cross features a heart with Krystal's initials. Toys also were left in
: her memory. 
: 
: Three previous memorials at the site along U.S. Highway 50 west of Carson
: City were desecrated. 
: 
: "This memorial is made of solid steel and concrete, and I'm confident it'll
: survive," said project organizer Gary James. 
: 
: "Krystal had such a short time to enjoy life, but had to endure such pain
: and misery ... To me, the memorial is not only for her but for all children
: that have suffered untimely deaths." 
: 
: James is a friend of Krystal's father, John Steadman of Gatlinburg, Tenn. 
: 
: Krystal was killed at Lake Tahoe in March 2000. The man charged with her
: murder, Thomas Soria Sr., committed suicide in the Douglas County jail in
: January 2001. 
: 
: The first memorial to the girl disappeared in October 2000. The second was
: vandalized a month later. 
: 
: Earlier this month, vandals damaged a cross made of wood and train rails
: with a chainsaw, and tossed toys into a nearby canyon. 
: 
: Stormy Stone, 9, of Carson City, was among about 30 people who watched as
: the new memorial was installed. She left some of her favorite toys. 
: 
: "I wanted to come to support the family," she said. "This memorial is
: special to us." 
: 
: Krystal, a fourth-grader from South Lake Tahoe, Calif., disappeared after
: Thomas Soria Jr. lured her to the apartment he shared with his father in
: Stateline, where her mother was visiting friends. 
: 
: The child's nude, battered body was found the following day along Highway
: 50 about 20 miles away. Authorities said she was raped and tortured before
: her throat was slashed. 
: 
: Soria Jr. is serving a no-parole life term for his role in the crime.

Another American killed by terrorists, this time a child by the La Raza terrorists who 
Bush gives amnesty to so they can continue to come here by the tens of thousands and 
then breed like cockroaches and cleanse Whites from the continent.

If you read "The Color of Crime" (http://www.amren.com) you will discover that the 
"Justice" Department in Washington D.C. classifies all Mexicans (mestizos) and Puerto 
Ricans (a lot of black blood) as "White". All of their sex offenses, all of their "Hate 
Crimes" are blamed on real White people.

The media casts all sex offenders (particularly child molesters) as White by 
broadcasting their pictures and publishing them repeatedly in their "news"papers, while 
hiding from public view the much larger number of spic mongrels and niggers who commit 
far more offenses of a deviant nature, most notably "Hate Crimes" in which White people 
are usually the *victim* of a nigger or spic mongrel offender. 

Naturally niggers are never charged with committing a "hate Crime" against Whites and a 
"Hispanic" can't be charged with committing a "Hate Crime" against a White person 
because these mud colored animals are classified as White.
