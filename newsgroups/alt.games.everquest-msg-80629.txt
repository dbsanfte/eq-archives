No freakin' way.  Warriors have it much, much, much worse than
Clerics.  At least there are mobs that give EXP to pull in Sol B.
There isn't a single blue to 56+ mob in Emerald Jungle.  No firegiants
to play with.  No LDCs to pull.  No lava tubes to swim in.  Nothing.
Ohhh, you can train those stupid mosquitos, wow, fun.  Bleh.  
(Actually, there is alwasy Hoshkar, so at least Warriors have an
option, though I'm not sure how often Hoshkar drops a scale.)

Once nice thing about the bard epic, almost evey drop is fairly
common.  I didn't have to camp a single mob, just got the pieces in
normal raiding and a LOT of running around with track going.  Of
course Gorenaire and Talendor aren't exactly killable with a pickup
group, but still, you know they'll drop a scale pretty damn often.
