	But there would be, in fact, no choice.  Your essence would precede your
existence; the particulars of your creation would dictate your response to
every "decision" you'd ever make.

	Consider: an omniscient deity would, in the very instant he considered the
existence of Dennis Francis Heffernan, know that I would be an atheist if I
were to exist as he considered me.  Yet he chose to bring me into existence as
such anyway, and according to some, I will be burned in fire forever as a just
consequence of a a *decision I never could have not made*.
