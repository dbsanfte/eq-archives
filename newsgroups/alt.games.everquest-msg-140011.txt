I am more for the challenge of EQ. It's more fun to kill a very hard mob
with a good group of people and loot an uber item which you can sell off in
the Bazaar.
Has not happened to me, but I still can dream about it. Can I? Hehe

Sure there will be people who have a few hundred dollars in their pockets

myself.
