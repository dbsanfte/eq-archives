I've had a few sources say that this was not the fact, and that you could not
zone back in unless it gives you your level back.   Was a big discussion in
/gu, with one person relating their story of being on a public raid with a
person who went afk and got caught in a death loop.    They had to take him to
the specters and powerlevel him before he could go in for his corpse.
