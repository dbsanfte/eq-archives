I have a B.A. in sociology, so I offer this (perhaps obvious) insight.


 I think what is happening is that when you ask for donations you
establish the relationship as one of give and take, conning the other,
haggling - which is fun / rewarding.  

If you let the SoW-receiver determine the relationship, he may define
it as one of gratitude and generosity, which has a bigger price tag in
order to affect the feeling he is seeking to affect, rather than the
low-ball, haggling effect which is also fun/rewareding
psychologically.

Hell, I'd say "Troll Shaman with few possessions but his spells and
pride, offering free SoWs to the fine people of EQ"  They see the
relationship you hope will get established, yet they get to decide it
(a little help / sympathy...) and control it. And if they can 'change"
you by virtue of the brief encounter (i.e. make you a person WITH
possessions and get a bigger thank you from the offerer than they had
to give as the original sow-receiver, they get a big heartful of
"done-good."  You'd have even more free offerings of cash and items.
You're saying come to me and you'll leave feeling better for having
helped a down-on-his-luck nice guy, and leave with your sow and a heap
of gratitude.

That's my 2 cp
