Never being put in a server queue and I play mainly at peak times.

I don't think Runnyeye that bad any longer. At first the lag was so
bad at times you had to stop and wait else you could magically jump
half way across the zone. I recalling being in one zone and all the
NPCs and PCs vanished! I just sat and waited for 5 minutes until
everyone turned up again!! But now I'm getting no major lag, even in
busy places banks.

Patch times are generally at 12-3pm. So, if you work it only hits at
the weekend and only for an hour. Plus it gives you a chance to do the
101 other things you should be doing instead of play EQ2!!
