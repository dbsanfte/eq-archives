No, in this case there is an actual difference.  Its a small one,
but critical to this discussion; running means you have to have
the fastest pull rate you can sustain, running out means you
discard "sustain" in favor of going as fast as you can, buring
out all remaining resources.

You can't burn that fast for an entire hour, its always possible
to spend more mana per minute than you regen in that minute.

My cleric's abilities are completely irrelevant to this
discussion, for the sake of which I'm using a clone of whatever
cleric you have, with the same instincts, gear, stats, and even
luck (perhaps he's used the same seed for the RNG:)

No, its impossible to sustain a pace any higher than a "steady
state" one for any length of time.  You can sprint for a little
while, spending more than you make back, watching your mana pool
slide down towards zero.  But not for long; eventually you run
down to the barrier, which is that unlike the US government, you
can't operate on deficit spending.  So I'll grant you that you
can pull twice as fast as normal for say 5 minutes.  Whether you
do that right after zoning in or at the end of the mission is
nearly irrelevant, an hour mission in which you double pull rate
for 5 minutes at any point (beginning, in the middle, at the end)
is now a 55 minute mission either way... the "nearly" part in
this case is exactly the issue under discussion here, which is
that if you pull at the beginning you have to do 50 minutes on
low mana, while if you do it at the end you get to keep a safety
margin for the first 50 minutes of the mission and only spend
down to low at the end.

Worse, though -you- propose not killing twice as fast for the
first five minutes, but rather zoning IN already LOM, wasting
your potential advantage, now you MUST take the full 60 minute to
complete the mission, while group B can do it in 55.  Your group
is actually slower at missions than group B, even though you
think somehow because you do the whole thing with practically no
mana available in case of emergencies, your group is in some
unfathomable way faster.

Well it -isn't- faster, because there's only so much mana
available, and because the two groups play in the very same way
in all instances except for their starting mana point.

No, your continuing to refuse to even attempt to understand the
single point I'm harping on here is silly.

I do have a lot of other problems with your position.

But I'm willing to adopt YOUR pull rate for the sake of THIS
argument.

Because this argument isn't about your pull rate, its about the
base mana level behind that pull rate.

Its about you operating at 30% instead of at 80%, at 20% instead
of at 70%, at 10% instead of at 60%.

Focus on this difference.

   Try.
     
       Try hard.

Because I'm tired of you going off on tangents.  

I'm speaking slowly, in short sentences, in paragraphs of one
sentence each.

"Play hard" isn't the issue, my hypothetical group is going to
play exactly as hard as yours, for the sake of this discussion.  

Its "play risky".

And my question is, what do you gain?

My point to asking is, I think you gain very very little, and you
risk a higher rate of failure.

And I thought you said you played to win.

If you really don't understand how the pull rate can be the same
even though I say it is, I'll explain it one more time, but
you'll have to ask, cause I'm tired of doing it and having you
ignore it.

If you don't understand what the difference is, if the pull rates
are the same, I'll explain that one more time, but you'll have to
ask, cause I'm tired of doing it and having you ignore it.

If you understand both those issues, and yet come up with yet
another non sequitor, I give up, killfile you and go on with my
life.

I will have to congradulate you on your amazing ability to seem
-almost- capable of rational thought for so long, I actually
thought we were having a heated but coherant disagreement... if
you can't get those two points into your head, though, you are
either some sort of idiot savant or a troll.
