I've finished my healing AA completely, I can crit Chloroblast for
1018 pretty regularly without a focus item which isn't too bad for a
ghetto healing class.  Unfortunately the only readily available
healing IV item goes in range which, for a Ranger, is a problem.

My Beastlord is only 40 but the pet heal he got at 39 is just...
scary.  600+ pet heals with a cheap bazaar earring for 125 mana!
