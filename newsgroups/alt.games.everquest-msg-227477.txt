1 have a 55 monk and druid, and was 2 boxing in jaggedpine (the gnolls) but
it's going cyan and i was hoping to try somewhere else. I noticed a lot of
the mobs in places like the LoY zones seemed immune to root and other zones
seem to have nasty summoners that ignore the monk and pound the druid to
death... can anyone think of a half decent duo spot?

I used to like the rockhoppers of DSP but people prefer the  tribals...
there's a lot of farming of the entire cave system by lv 65 bards etc and
the resulting wave of destruction if they zone is appalling; i seem to get
on their hate list even if i'm ages away, and 20 tribals can smack you down
pretty damn fast.
