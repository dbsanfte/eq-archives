OK I went and saw The day after... at a Regal/Edwards theater in
Orange County Southern California, and sure enough during the
infomercial called "The Twenty"; the EQ2 commercial we heard and
talked about played. The down side for me was I didn't get to see it
as I decided to get a coke instead and missed most of "The Twenty". I
thought it would be an ad, but it was actually a full length feature
piece of "The Twenty", as a matter of fact it was the second feature
of three. I only knew this because when they were wrapping up 'The
Twenty" they summarized what had been covered. 

I thought about staying to see it prior to the next showing, but they
cleared the theater because the next showing of "The Day After.." was
sold out. Oh well, I hope something comes out next Friday I want to
see... :-P
