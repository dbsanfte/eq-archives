I've started a thread at
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum4/HTML/046046.html
(URL will probably wrap) basically inquiring if SoE could come up with a
deal to ship Evolutions cheaper than $33 to Europe.
If any Europeans / Australians in this NG are interested in getting a copy
I'd ask you to reply there and maybe someone at SoE will take note.

As I mentioned in another post, I want to start another account and buying
this expansion seems a very cost-effective way to get all the current
expansions...untill you see the price: $33 to ship a $30 product.

When PoP came out they managed to come up with a $10 shipping charge which
was fine.  I realise that the interest in PoP will probably be better than
that in Evolutions (esp with LDoN imminent) but I'd like to get it sooner
rather than later without having to incur large shipping costs.

If they shipped it digitally, or on DVD (or even just sold account keys)
that would be cheaper all round...

Anyway, if you are interested in getting Evolutions and are not based in the
US, please go to the thread above and add your say!

Thanks in advance

Tzen
