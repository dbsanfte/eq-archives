Shaman would be the best partner in my opinion. Pet, haste, slow, heal, stat
buffs, decent damage output.

If you can self heal decently, the enchanter might not be bad, but I'd
rather have the shaman personally. (I can't do crowd control when 2 boxing,
and mana regen is nice, but especially at later levels, you're going to pay
100cr to get your group kei'd anyway... Shaman can also canni himself,
should never run out of mana if two boxed well) I don't want to try to
twist, even with a programmed game pad, so bard's out.

Cleric and Druid primarily bring good healing, and damage for the druid, or
cleric vs undead.

Powerleveling with a ranger would be an interesting trick. You don't say
what level you are. I think what you want to do is taunt (but not attack)
like a maniac while the other powerlevellee gets em damaged below 50
percent, then melee. Remember to snare. You also can help with buffs that
are above what they can do themselves.

This is about how a 53 warrior  pl'd me 2 levels back in the 20s. (I had an
enchanter, so what we did more of was he beat it till it turns,  I root,
memblur a couple of times, then nuke it down.)

If you've got a PL expert in your guild, see if you can round him up. We've
had a guy in our guild with 7 50+'s that would powerlevel anyone in the
guild for an hour a day.
