Don't forget to do the math:

Old full group xp bonus 20%, new full group xp bonus 80% plus 20% of the 
xp per mob on top of that, or 180%x0.2 = 116%.

So, if you go to a zone that the ZEM has not changed on (nonPoP zones 
according to SoE), then, you get 96% more xp than you used to get prior 
to the change, in other words, almost double the xp.  In addition to 
that, they extended range of dark blue mobs so for high level players 
they can get that xp bonus in zones that they were unable to xp in prior 
to the change.
