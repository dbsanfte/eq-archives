I do believe trolls are KOS to the commons guards, so it'd probably be 
safer for him to run to East Freeport (keeping to the right hand wall) 
get a bind just inside the city line, then go back to N Ro and join a 
derv group.  No wandering guards, good exp.

Ryou

(or he could try and get a group with one of the orc groups in EC.  
There's zone lines close to both in case of a wandering guard, he can 
once again bind just inside the city line (WFree in this case) and he 
can definitely use the faction.)
