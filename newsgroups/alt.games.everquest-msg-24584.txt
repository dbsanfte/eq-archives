Last time I tried it was  a couple months ago.  To say it was buggy would be
an understatement.  Considering the responses you've already gotten, it
sounds like it hasn't been improved much.

It's against EULA but hell, I'm kinda FOR the stupid program since I don't
cheat and I really like the idea of seeing what the frame rate is.  But
until they work out all those bugs I'm not going to bother with it again.
