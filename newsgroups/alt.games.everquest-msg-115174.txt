It's possible to do, I've got a level 1 ogre warrior in Kael just to do
corpse dragging, I can pull a corpse from just inside the temple area (on
the bridge) to down past the see invis line without being killed with the
arena area fully popped.

You have to pull the corpse from maximum range, always, as well as not pull
it to or from the feet of a giant.  Wait for wanderers to go past, and if
you do get agro, try to keep dragging a few more feet before you die, every
extra bit helps. ( I did die one time pulling a corpse from the see invis
line down to the bank, wanderer warped on top of me as I hit the /cor
hotkey)
