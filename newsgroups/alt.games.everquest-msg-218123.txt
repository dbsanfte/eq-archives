Can't get anybody interested.  I've tanked for higher level casters
and so seen the next "step" up from the stiffs I usually have to
fight.  But I was more of a meat puppet than a meat shield there
(you know, like the wounded goats they stake out to draw the
giant lizards out where the tourists can see them) I doubt I
outdamaged any of the three pets over the course of the run (and
it was, of course, another easy success).

You and your friends got any alts you haven't leveled all the way
up yet?  Kaev's only 56, so he doesn't yet have any possibility of
seeing those 800 hitting mobs in the "hard" L65 missions.
