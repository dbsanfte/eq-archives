BoT CY is not significantly harder to solo than PoV golems or outer cave.  
Same goes for HoH in the places that single pulling is easy to do.  In 
the BoT CY you just have to watch for the storm riders that CH 
themselves, as, at least for a shaman, they are a bitch to kill.  HoH has 
the problem of some mobs, that look exactly like the others you are 
killing, being immune to root/snare.

I have spent load of time soloing in LoY, and, it is better than PoP 
soloing in that you actually get cash loot in addition to xp.
