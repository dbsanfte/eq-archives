I considered WoW, but I don't really feel like learning a new game.
I'm afraid it'll be disappointing as I pine for the "good old days" of
EQ.  Of course, at this point EQ is like a new game anyway.

I admit it, I'm nostalgic for a video game.  Kinda sad.  But then I
still have a working Atari 2600 that I fire up sometimes.  I hope some
day, several years down the road, SoE allows (stripped down) private
servers to be put up, or maybe keeps a server going for free for us
old timers.
