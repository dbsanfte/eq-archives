From the shadows, the mysterious "James Grahame"
<jamesgrahame@shaw.ca> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially
whispered:

No biggy, just recreate.


>(2) People with evil characters logged in Grobb will log them on and get
>ganked by frogs before they can say "Mommy!"

The city DID get invaded by an army. I think its a good thing to have
to try to extracate themselves.

That's too damn bad. Next time maybe they'll remember that no faction
is guaranteed to be useless forever.

Only takes one trip to learn. The Dark Elves are good teachers.

Yes, that will be annoying.

You have no evidence of this.

Because resists mean oh so much at L10....

On new servers all the newbie zones are packed regardless. Does it
really matter if a zone is at 500% capacity rather than 300%?

The capacity for the playerbase to pointlessly whine continues to
astound me. I thought you had been around longer than this.
