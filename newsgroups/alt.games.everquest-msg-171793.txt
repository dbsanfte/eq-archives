Winged Death is the only druid dot that will stack with earlier dots.
Prior to it, drifting death would overwrite drones of doom and so on
down the line. While I first thought it was a bug, it's stayed the same
long enough I guess they don't care, but it was definately the first dot
other than the one fire based dot, immolate, that druids could stack.
Winged death was really the one that made root/dotting worth doing for
druids, IMO, other than a brief few levels when the 250 dmg of immolate,
stacked with drones, would kill a mob in a reasonable time. Breath of Ro
also helped the druid root/dot effectively, as you could stack up 3k of
dots. I guess it was done because the healing spells back then were so
ineffective the druid lost his role as a healer in experience groups.
