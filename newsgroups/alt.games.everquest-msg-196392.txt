Kunark and Velious did little for low level characters (Kunark at least added a
race so there -were- new low level characters) but after that they seem to have
figured out that they should include something for everyone in an expansion.

SOL gave us (belatedly, very belatedly) the Bazaar, as well as easier
transportation via nexus.  (also added Shar Val, a city with no faction troubles
for anyone, so your party of mixed races can all play together, as they
eventually will thru the higher levels all the time)

POP gave us the book transport system, opening the world up to everyone= a Vast
expansion for newbies who can now fight at level one in every newbie zone in the
game  (well nearly, LOIO is tricky for a level one to get to...)

LOY gave us the Maps; love those maps.  The world is vastly easier to get around
in when you have a map, particularly since you can make notes right on them.
Apparantly there are also some journal functions to help make quests easier to
follow, I've not looked into that.
