I've got a few friends that keep raving about how awesome DAoC is and how
much "better" than EQ it is, but I don't think they've even played EQ for
more than a few hours at the most on their friends computers.

Have any of you played it?
Why is it they're so adament about trying to "convert" us?
Is it worth paying the money just to give it a shot?
