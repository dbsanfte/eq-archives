Go to the Hole and camp the entrance with a small group of equal(ish) levels
(one tank, one healer class and you will be fine) and you'll make 52
in...well, erm...much faster than you would anywhere else bar the planes (I
can't compare, don't own the expansion) that'll take you to 53 easily, after
that you'll need a bigger group and have to head a bit further in to avoid
light blues.

Personally your suggestion of giving up on levelling a bit might be an idea
but if you want to make some fast(?) safety exp that would be my suggestion.
I went thru 52 - 53 there, pulling only as far as the Golem/Crusader bridge
and have nearly made it thru 53 (Druid dinged 54 and Chanter not far behind,
Warrior working on AA) killing trash trying to complete TS Quests.
