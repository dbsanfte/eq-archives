I don't know the locations where you get ported to. The best way to get
there is to lev yourself, get on a boat, and run down there.  If you want to
get on the evil boat you can, just make sure you have levitate on and when
you zone into TD just run around the ogre island. You can't cast on any boat
so you'll need to have it before you get on.  Just write down the /loc, make
a /loc hotkey, and run south to it.  Yes there are a lot of things that can
kill you, most notably, a big red dragon by the name of Faydedar.  Since he
is fairly rare and drops an important item for the Druid Epic weapon quest,
he's usually not around but if it's Friday the 13th or you just have plain
bad luck, he could spawn right on top of you as you're going there.  You
would definitely die in that case.  There are also a bunch of lower level
mobs like fire gators in the water around the portal.  I don't know if
they're KOS, but I know they are higher than level 14, so if you are kos and
you came across one you probably wouldn't be able to kill it, but you could
probably gate out.
