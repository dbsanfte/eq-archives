I've never understood the "I-played-for-five-minutes-and-hated-it"
mentality.  I loved EQ from the moment my first toon fell into Norrath.
what a fantastic world!  such rich, lush graphics! true 3-d world that you
can explore to it's limits!  The ability to play with other people from all
over the world!  What's not to love.  It's only gotten better as my chars
mature...

good riddance to bad trash.

The game is clearly not their cup of tea!

This way, Sony makes an extra $50 that may keep my subscription rates a bit
cheap for another month!! G!
