I mentioned in another post,people not willing to do
an adv with my 53 Pally as main healer,of course keied.
Did an adv with only 4 players,Pal,Pal,Bst,Enc,we had
15 minutes left when we finished,one of the moments
that keep me grouping,instead of exclusively soloing.
Hm,ok, Pally is pretty good equipped,I think around
150k in gear.
