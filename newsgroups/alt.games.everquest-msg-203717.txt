I'd totally forgotten about Grieg's, probably because I dislike the
place so much. Annoying greens at the zone lines and a boss mob that's
the most annoying I can think of in my limited raiding experience.  I
do want to get back there sometime soon, would love to have the
alchemist stone from there. 

As for Ssra, it's a borderline dungeon crawl zone imo. First floor
might be able to handle one good group, basement tunnels maybe 2 or 3
groups but gawd it's boring. Once you get to the 2nd floor, you start
dealing with mobs that hit for close to 500 and aren't slowable,
pre-PoP that was only a single group camp with almost a perfect group.
