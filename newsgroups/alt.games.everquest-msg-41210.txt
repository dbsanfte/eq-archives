Please indulge me for a moment while i try to put this in perspective from
MY point of view:

I do not wish anyone innocent to die.  It is an unfortunate matter of fact
that some, probably many will.  I dont advocate carpet bombing or wholesale
nuclear strikes vs geographical regions based on stereotypes.  I know beyond
any shadow of doubt that we as a country are MUCH smater than this, although
when emotions speak it doesnt neccesarily seem that way.

I also know that the countries that harbor or even support the groups of
people have militaries.  When choosing to do this, THEY take on the burden
of protecting their civilians from the threat of violence against them.  If
you dont want to fight with the big kid on the block then dont associate
with and/or support those who do.

I truely feel for the people of these countries who dont have the means or
ability to relocate to a more palatable atmosphere, the loss of those lives
is just as tragic as the lives lost yesterday.  Unfortunate and tragic, yet
unavoidable to some extent.

I find some comfort, upon reflecting on the world's reaction, in the
realization that EVERYONE (including known or suspected terrorists) is
avoiding any association with this act.  I hope, beyond hope, that this
feeling is genuine and leads to positive change; possibly a radical shift by
many to stop this support.

For those who say to the people of the US that you are no better than anyone
else, All I can say is:  Watch us in action.  The people of New York,
Washington DC, and across the country.  Thes people are truely the heroes
here.  Lines in every city to support donating supplies and blood.  People
on the scenes risking life and limb, in mass, just for the hope that there
may be just ONE life saved.

We are not gathered in the streets burining flags of other countries, nor
throwing rocks at our neighbors.  There maybe isolated Hate mongers and
opportunists, but i assure you, these are the minority here. In time, even
they will be the taget of the majorities condemnation (not violence).  If
you argue about our pride in victory during WW2 or the Gulf as being similar
to these reactions, I suggest that you reflect upon the events further, and
you will see the difference.  WW2 was global in proportion, noone was
celebrating the loss of life in Japan, more for the return of our troops
from harms way.  If we were truely the mass destructors of the earth we
would have continued the use of Nuclear weapons to dispose of all our
enemies.  We realized rather quickly that these weapons were obscene in
nature.  While they may be built, they havent been used since.  A
threatening gesture and an ominous reminder of how things can escalate. In
the Gulf, we again celebrated the return of our men and women and of a
campaign that miniimized the loss of innocent lives.

I stand ready to obey the orders of my Commander and Chief, where ever that
leads.  Knowing, without a doubt, that the orders given will be prudent and
designed to minimize innocent lives lost.

Sorry this got so long...and i am sure i missed a point or two i had
intended to make.
