That's a bug - if you re-cast a spell when your current one is blinking,
sometimes the new copy craps out as the old one fades (it must take to
the target just as the server decides to wipe that buff). You can
overwrite a SoW - if you cast a SoW on someone who's had one for 10min
or whatever, you're resetting the time before it runs out with your new
cast of the spell. You can't overwrite a SoW cast by someong of a higher
level than you, though.
