I found that simply asking directions got results.  I help newbie Vah
Shir find their way around the city quite often.  Takes just a minute
or two to show them the major places they'll need to know.  Also,
don't trash a class just because you are not familiar with it and
don't have walk throughs for every single part of the class.  I LIKE
the class because of the challenge.  With a little help from people
who answered questions when I asked them, I made level 6 in about the
time you spent.  If you want to take the easy way and twink - in my
opinion lazy, fine and more power to ya.  Just don't talk trash about
the rest of us who want a challenge.  Go join the rest of the
munchkins and leave the real gameplay to those of us who like it.
