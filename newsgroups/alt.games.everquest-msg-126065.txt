I was in teh same boat - never really saw the appeal in a MMORPG, myself.
Then I got DAoC.....

 To say that the raw size of Norrath wow'd me when I moved to it from DAoc
would be an understatement. It's HUGE. By level 30 in DAoC, you've probably
been just about eveywhere. My roomies and some friends all have some level
60+ characters in EQ, and still haven't visited everywhere. It's one of the
things I like about it - if you want to see teh world, be prepared to invest
some serious time dashing about.

Quests are another thing that I think are better. DAoC may have a *very*
user-friendly journal for quests, but EQs are WAY more involved. Go take a
look at a walk-through for any classes epic vs. the 'epic' quests for DAoC.
There is no comparison. The EQ quests are truly epic in nature.

There *are* a lot of things that DAoC does do better. The interface is much
nicer, and it's nice to be able to something other then "swing sword, apply
bandages" as a straight melee, but overall, I prefer the larger world

I don't think you'll be completely out of the loop if you only have that -
there is still *a lot* for you to do. just keep a pen and paper handy for
keeping notes on qhat quests you pick up. :-) There's a lot of good fun to
be had in the lands available to you.
