Your problem is lack of power to the motherboard.  I had the exact same
thing and it cleared it right up by getting a new power supply of at least
400 watts.  Stick with name brands like Antec or Enermax.

My settings before i got the new power supply that mostly worked were:

Vcore 1.650 Default
Vcore 0.025 adjust
Vcore 1.675 current

Dimm 2.50 Default
Dimm 0.20 adjust
Dimm 2.70 current


These can be raised much higher then i had them without ruining hardware.
Windows would error trying to boot if the settings were wrong. Just keep
an eye on your cpu temp.  You dont want it to go above 60 celcius.
