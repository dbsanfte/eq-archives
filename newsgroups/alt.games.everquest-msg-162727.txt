One of the most annoying things about EverQuest, for me anyways,
is dying due to link death.

It would be ideal if the server simply removed your character from
the game after a relatively short amount of time (say, ten seconds)
with no heartbeat packet from the client.  But this can't be done
because it would be exploited:  Whenever someone was in trouble they
could simply unplug the network connection, or just /q.

So I'd like to propose this solution:  After a user-programmable
amount of inactivity from the client, the server automatically
executes a user-specified command on behalf of the character.  You
could select whether you wanted this command to be executed only if
you are attacked while going link dead, or whenever you do link dead.

If you're a cleric, you can Divine Aura.  Monks and Necros can
Feign Death.  Or you could Spirit of Cheetah and run.  Or Gate or
Evac.  Or just plain sit down so you don't login halfway across the
zone.

After the usual 30 seconds expires, you are removed from the game,
as happens now.

I haven't been able to think of a way this could be exploited, and
I think it would significantly reduce the number of link-dead related
deaths if properly configured.

Does this sound like a decent idea?

Thanks, as always!
