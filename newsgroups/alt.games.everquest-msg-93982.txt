All I can say is what I respond to.  If I am say sitting at the bank in FV,
and someone shouts or oocs, or better yet, uses say,  for a bind at the
bank, I will usually then send said person a tell informing him that I'll
bind him, or sow, or whatever.  If, on the other hand, I am making the run
to DL, but still in FV zone, I will not say anything.  If someone were to
send me a direct tell, no matter how it's phrased, while I am making said
run, I might respond with a no, after I zone into DL.  If I am not busy,
sitting at the bank, I will usually also buff if they send me a tell, but if
I am not sitting there, and not busy, then I will usually just ignore the
tell, just like I would an ooc or shout.
