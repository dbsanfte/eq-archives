Hey Foxy,

Just so you know there are currently some very sustained hacker attacks 
going on around the globe against various websites that are supporting 
Iraq.

There is alot of junk out there on the web at the moment and i my self have 
had a number of bounced emails this week. Many of the web sites i have 
tried to access are either down or just plain unreachable because the web 
is overworked. I'm sure your friend is safe Foxy you might just find that 
it was a comms problem at thier end honey :)
