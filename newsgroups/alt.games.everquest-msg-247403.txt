The people who are complaining about this typically aren't 'power
players'. Its mostly just idealistic casual players. A 'power player'
would applaud the fact they could just buy their shit now legally
because they were the ones doing it before. As per those idealists.. i
guess you'll get your chance now to 'stick it to the man' and drop
your EQ account if they go through with this. But... i think if all
the past changes were any indication.. we'll see you in game.

Only question is.. where you gonna go? Expect these changes industry
wide if SoE's setup flies. Ya.. like Blizzard isn't gonna jump on that
bandwagon if the industry leader is doing it and its working. Nobody
is gonna shovel shit against the tide like Sony has done for the past
5 years if they decide to go through with this and get on the bus.
