Yep.  I'm actually Amiable with the HP guards and fine citizens of that
area. I'm counting on being at least dubious with the militia in FP by
virtue of having turned in better than a hundred scalps, and dozens of
goblin ears, each one giving me a positive militia hit.  If it turns out
that wasn't enough, and I'm still KOS to the bastards, then I guess it's
down into the tunnels with me.

Never had too much trouble with Tolus. It's Reskin and, of course, Slate
that I'd like to take down. Ah......... someday.
