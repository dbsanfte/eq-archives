By FC and BC I assume you mean the inner and outer cave areas?  We
call them IC and OC on Morell, hehe.

Yeah, PoV is the best exp you can get unflagged...so incredibly much
better than older world mobs.  And he can still duo with the druid if
he has to, on the hill outside the cave and also in the area northeast
of the regular golem camps.  Agro kiting can be dangerous and boring,
but it works.

As for the tier one zones:

-For best experience in PoN, kill hobgoblins just across the river,
banshees and other stuff by the hedge, and gargoyles near the
village/castle thing.  Need a regular group (at least add a slower)
for all but the gargs.

-For best experience in PoDisease, kill the lightcrawlers and
underbulks outside the castle (56 or 57 level) or, since you are a
Pally, go inside the castle and kill the undead maguses (magi?) and
whatnot (a level or two higher once inside) inside the castle up to
the door where the key mob wanders around.  You need regular groups
(slower and healer) for this for the most part.

-For best experience in PoJ (worst of the four tier 1 zones IMO) kill
in death row, or find the tunnels.  You can farm components for the
+20 wis ring there at the same time.  Need a regular group.

-For best experience in PoI, go inside the factory and kill the level
60ish robots.  Need a regular group and also a puller who is on the
ball.  I dont think they can be pac'ed/harmo'ed so you need a feign
puller.
