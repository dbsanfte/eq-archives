I think that's a great idea!

They could also use the flagging system that is already in place. Just put
an npc beside the PoK books, who, when hailed, would flag the character to
click that book from inside PoK.  No flag would be required to click up to
PoK.

They could also make it a quest for lower level characters - upon first
hailing the npc outside their home book, they would receive a charm that
increases in power as they unlock more books.

Personally, the first time I ran from qeynos to freeport was one of the most
exciting and scary times I can remember in EQ!  New players need to
experience that too!
