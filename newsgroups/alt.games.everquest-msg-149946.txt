Some "Uber" mobs have increased decay timers. I am not sure the exact
limit, but generally it's long enough to roll, argue, re-roll and
argue a bit more :-P.

There is no sure-fire way to prevent Ninja looting.....Keep see-invis
up, and keep tabs on who is in the zone. Having someone sit with the
loot window open (usually the raid leader or some one assigned to see
what items dropped) is a good way to avoid Ninja-Looters. Ideally
everyone should know who gets what (if it drops) before you engage the
mob. The more time wasted trying to figure out loot rights after the
mob is dead, the greater the chances someone will "Ninja".

On the raids I have attended in the past, once it was determined that
the item was going to rot, it was announced. Personally I don't see
any point in picking up a nodrop item that I cannot use <shrug>.

NEVER expect to get exp at a raid. If you do, you will get frustrated
and burnt out very quickly. Unless you are always in the KS group :-)
(Rogues, Wiz's...big damage dealers). Many players lose exp on raids.
Especially if they are going after the tougher mobs for the first time
or learning the ropes. Pullers, and high risk/agro classes
(Enchanters, Clerics, Shaman, etc) are usually the losers exp wise.

If everything is spelled out in advance, and the rules are followed to
the letter, things almost always work out fine. Things usually go
wrong when those distributing the loot change the rules mid-raid.
That's when things start to get really ugly.
