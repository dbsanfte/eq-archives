I would install them in the order in which they were released (EQ, Kunark,
Velious, Luclin, PoP).

The reason is that each expansion updates zone files, program code, etc, and
each expansion is probably going to assume that it's the latest expansion,
so it won't check to see if it's overwriting a later version of a file.

So install them in order, then patch.
