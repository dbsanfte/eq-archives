Whenever someone enters the area of effect of Sentinel, the server
sends a message saying so. With lots of movement, this can make people
go link dead because of the amount of traffic.

There is a limit to the number of items shown in the bazaar window, so
if you just choose 1HB, there will almost certainly be more than fits,
so you only see the ones that have been there longest.

Magicians often use the AE summon mod rod spell
(http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2538&source=Live) in the bazaar,
which makes everyone nearby end up with a mod rod in their hand. Makes
a decent newbie weapon, and can kill people who don't have enough hit
points and experiment with it (such as newbies who have no idea what
this thing they suddenly got is...)
