  If budget is not a big concern, get a GeForce3 Ti500.  It will run
you $300+.

  If budget is a bit of a concern, get a GeForce3 Ti200 (~$165-$200)
or a RADEON 8500 (~$190 OEM... note that some people are wary of ATI
cards because of ATI's history of writing not-so-good drivers... but
the image quality of the RADEON 8500 is supposedly top notch and it
has very impressive hardware specs).

  If budget is a primary concern, get a GeForce2 of some sort.  A
Ti200 would probably be most preferable, or failing that, a 64 mb
GeForce2 Pro card, or failing that, a 64 mb GeForce2 GTS, or failing
that, a 64 mb GeForce2 MX400.  You ought to be able to find one of
these for between $60 and 100.  Some people have also reported decent
performance with graphics cards using the Kryo II chipset, which can
also be purchased in the $60-80 price range.

  A lot of people seem to be doing okay even with inexpensive/older
cards (VooDoo3's, GeForce MX's, Kryo II's, ect).  The way it seems to
be shaping up is that while a good CPU/graphics card helps, the
performance bottleneck for most people with Luclin is memory size.
From what I've been reading, I personally would sooner upgrade my PC
to a gigabyte of memory before spending a $100+ premium for the
fastest graphics card on the market if EQ performance were my main
concern.

  Hope this helps.
