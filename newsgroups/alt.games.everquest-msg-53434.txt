Superior Healing casts in 4.5 seconds, not 4.0.  So you'll need a pause of
at
least 50 to get the macro to work as you want, probably a bit longer to
allow for some lag.

BTW, including sitting down in that macro is a *bad* decision.  If
the Superior Healing cast fizzles, you can't recast it until *after*
the pause.   That's about 5 seconds where you're wanting to heal
but can't.  Just macro standing up and casting the heal, and leave
it at that.   Create another macro which does nothing but /book 1
and click it after the heal goes off successfully.
