Yes, that's what they said.  And as far as I know two players <can>
stack the same DoT on a mob.  However, it is also possible for a
single player to stack multiple DoTs from the same line on a mob
now.  Specificly, my Druid routinely stacks Creeping Crud and
Stinging Swarm, which was not possible prior to the stacking change.
I don't know if either of these is possible with DoTs that also have
debuffs, like the Druid fire-based or Enchanter magic-based DoTs,
but I'll try Flame Lick and Immolate next time I play (just got 29
on my Druid).
