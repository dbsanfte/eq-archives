Nor mine. I tend to wander soloing things. At lvl 27 and a ranger I can do
this and avoid the whole camping situation. I also dont have encyclopedic
knowedge of what good kit is about and where to get it...I go places, hunt
and find stuff....and its that I find most rewarding, other than a
good group raid with my guild (A few messy moments in Najena on AB on
Sunday but even though I lost xp by the buckets it was FUN)....

On the other hand I recognise that sooner or later I am going to need to
camp for quests and possibly later on for particular kit pieces. Less fun
to be had, but when I need to talk to NPC X, id like to be able to call a
camp to use it, or be able to have someone around with recognised dibs on
it who will let me do the talky bit before they kill it haplessly and I
have to wait a week for another chance.
