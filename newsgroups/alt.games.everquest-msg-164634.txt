Its quite valuable now, since the smiths need it to make cultural armor, 
and think the fletchers need it too to make the Thunderbolt (not 100% on 
that, not a fletcher).
In the old days, it were used for brewing elven wine (could be bought in 
stores, doubt anyone wanted to spend time foragning it to skill up 
instead of using store bought stuff for skillups), for smithing (fierdal 
sewing kit, some mediocre cultural weapons), and for tailoring (wood elf 
cultural, i used 3 pr try to make boots, only sellable item).
Old days, i got loads by offering 1pp each, but nowadays people wanna 
pay 50pp+ for it, since its used in cultural armor that sell for quite a 
lot.
There aer 3 ways to get it:
Forage in Gfay (bad idea, the following rares are on the forage table: 
Cinnamon Sticks, the stupid epic fruit, Morning Dew)
Forage in Lfay (best place, only rares are Morning Dew and some kind of 
herb for brewing, so 50% change to get it if you forage a rare, intead 
of 33% chance in Gfay)
Ground spawn in Lfay (yes, they DO spawn on the ground, and yes, just as 
stupidly hard to find as the other ground spawns).
So best bet for them are to hunt something in Lfay and forage while you 
do. I personally did some pixie genocide to get pixie dust for baking 
while foraging them, could end up with 4 stacks of pixie dust and around 
1 stack of morning dew in 2 hours.
