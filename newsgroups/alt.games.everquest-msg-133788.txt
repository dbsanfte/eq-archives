Apparently I'm math challenged - or we are all.  Last night I was
grouping with a guildie for 30 minutes before I realized he wasn't in
his 20s, as I thought, but actually JUST 20.  I was 31.  In a bit of a
panic, I asked if he was getting experience and he assured me he was.
So was I.

Weird?  Or is there a 'do all the math', then add 1 factor of some
sort?
