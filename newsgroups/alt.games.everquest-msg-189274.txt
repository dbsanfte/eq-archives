My clericbot is 17 atm (computer problems stopped the PLing early), 1-8 in
field of bone, 9-15 in kurns tower, 16-17 in paludal, left paludal to try
netherbian lair because of the morons in paludal, netherbian sucks.  Moving
to unrest and mistmoore for next stage.

clarification on level of cleric (who kinda suck as PLer unless paired with
a mage, then they own) or "nice equipment" would help.

My cleric ended up with a bunch of crap off my necro and warrior and a few
cheap high hp items (6ac/65 hp rings, 2 ac/35 hp/25 mana earrings), and a
cloak of flames (now hiero cloak) on loan from the warrior that shares the
cleric account with me (rl friend, he plays cleric on first comp, I play
myself on second comp casting buffs/heals, and I play starcraft on third
comp at same time.)
