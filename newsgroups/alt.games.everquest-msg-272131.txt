Because the color is only one factor to consider when determining the
expected difficulty of an encounter. The little up/down-arrows are equally
important.

A mob with two or three up-arrows can be much, much tougher than the color
would otherwise indicate. E.g., I have found that some green++ mobs I can
beat easily, while others have killed me before I had a chance to run.

This is a feature to make encounters less predictable, and hence more
interesting, not a design flaw. One could argue, that it's not entirely fair
that only the color affects the XP and bonus loot, but I suppose this was
done to enforce/encourage grouping for some quests and to ensure that quests
are done by PC's at proper levels, which, in turn, ensures that rewards are
appropriate for the level.
