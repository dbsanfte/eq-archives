Winmodems are a fact of life these days. 99% or all modems are winmodem
types.
the problem is not so much you have a winmodem, it is that you have a BAD
winmodem (I work for an ISP... BCM rates two bads. Bad Bad. It could be
worse we have a customer that complains every two days with a 4 bad modem)

I would go out and get a Lucent or Conexant/Rockwell HCF chipset based
modem.

Call your ISP's tech support and see what they recommend, chipset wise.

If your ISP doesn't support V.92 it might be better to avoid them.

check out http://www.modemsite.com
They may have an init string for your existing modem (I don't have my
cookbook in front of me or I'd give you some init string ideas for a BCM)

They have a section on buying modems...

good luck
