Greetings all.

I'm positive this question has been asked before, but I haven't seen an answer
to this question in my travels, so perhaps someone could take the time to
answer it for me?

I'm currenlty running EQ:Ruins of Kunark (boxed set) and have a strange
problems with my video.

Occasionally, typically during zoning, the border around my screen (where
buttons, spells, etc are located) will "flicker".  If I press F10, the
flickering stops.

What causes this?  My cousin has a similar problem... we both have ATI cards. 
Is it EQ, or is it the ATI cards?

Second question:

The "main" screen (ie not full screen mode or transparencies mode) runs at
640x480 at default.  If I change my resolution to 800x600 (or higher) the full
screen/trasnparencies mode looks GREAT... but when I come back to the "main"
screen, it either a) switches to 640x480 or has a large black border around it
(but runs at 800x600) depending on the options I have set.

I've heard that the Scars of Velious upgrade fixes this.  Is this true?  Is
there any other way?  I would really like to run at 800x600 or higher, but the
boarder/small size of the main window or the "clicking" of my monitor changing
resolution is annoying :)

Thanks in advance!
