Yeah I tried DaoC for a short time. It looks nicer, and in many ways plays
better than EQ, but I just found it dull. There didn't seem any point to
doing
anything. I guess EQ is the same, it's just that I'm used to it but I think
that
EQ is just more fun even if it's not as technically good, and the rules are
not as
well thought out in theory
