Every time i get past the login screen. the logs show something like

the application generated an app error the exception generated was
c0000005 at address 010C9B9D (t3SetCameraRenderWindow)
 

can anyone help with this? i have tried 3 different drivers for my
card (GeForce MX 200 64 meg), all the same result. even tried
emulating win98 under shortcut properties. this is driving me nuts as
i have scoured the net and found maybe one person with the same
problem.

please email me if you can help me!
