Avocets are indeed 28-30. But of course, you get a sizable chunk of
xp from all the other aviaks that spawn there. And as I recall,
xp seemed to really slow down as you hit high twenties because the
much higher percentage of greens and teals you were fighting.

And you're offended that *some* people play suboptimally? That they enjoy
different play styles than you? What is the correct number of deaths per
night I should be having to demonstrate both a correct amount of risk and
a high level of skill, in your opinion?

I believe people are more likely to evaluate what counts as "excellent xp"
on a relative basis than an absolute basis. If you're gaining a level a
night at KFC until you ding 27, then gain half a level the next night, I
think most people are going to take that as a sign to move on. It doesn't
matter that half a level a night is still pretty good xp.

They (roughly) doubled the (full group) xp reward for killing a mob, and
left the xp penalty for dying alone. To my mind, that means I should
actually be moving on to tougher mobs earlier than before because even
though I might be dying more often the higher xp more than makes up for
it.
