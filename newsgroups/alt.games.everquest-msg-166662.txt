Every time I've been in CC (and I agree, its a crappy, crappy, useless zone as
is all of eastern wastes don't even bother to visit :) and the geos were camped
there were still some milling around up "at the top" while the "Campers" were
medding down by the spiders. (I can see them on tracking, ya know).   What a
waste if someone wants them.
Vent:
 When we do the Ry`gorr Fort I'm always the first one to say "we will be happy
to share".  I often regret it when some dickhead runs through and grabs
everything or trains the zone.  Then there was the group that decided to run in
and plop their worthless butts down INSIDE the mystic building and ONLY do the
inside rygorrs, (meaning the elites and chief too), after WE BROKE THE FREAKIN
CAMP!!!   (They were obviously CLUELESS because less than 10 minutes later they
were running around like the morons they clearly were trying to find the CC
zone).  They are all on my "idiots of velius" list now.
*Sharing* means *sharing* to me, especially when *we* are at the fort first. 
Some people have no manners and no couthity.  End of vent.
