So it is flagged NO TRADE but you can sell it to merchants and someone else
can buy it from that same merchant again (I assume unless all stuff you sell
get eaten which is a just slightly less stupid thing)?

If something like that happend in EQ it would be tagged as MAJOR BUG, the

Seems like EQOA has even more clueless GM's then EQ :).
