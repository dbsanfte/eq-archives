It can still be done (sort of) by pressing F10 and going into the keyboard
setup screen.  Then setup your Sense heading hotkey in the 4th position on
the Hotkey Toolbar.  Next setup the Num Pad 4 key to be used to activate the
#4 hotkey.  I don't know if this makes any sense, but basically what I am
trying to say is just go into your keyboard setup and play around a little
bit in there.
