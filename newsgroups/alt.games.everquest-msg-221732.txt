Actually, my ranger tanks all the time. Very successfully. And always
solo.

In my case, my ranger grew up back when people would rather have a moss
snake in their group than a ranger. Couldn't find groups to save my life.
Even ranted about it in shout one day in EC (back when that was the
bazaar on my server). Felt much better after that, and got a ton of
high-level ranger buffs from someone who had been there too. Anyway,
because I couldn't get groups, my ranger always (always, ALWAYS) soloed.
So I never learned how a ranger should tank in a group. Even now that I
can get groups (though I don't join them very often) I tend to avoid
being MT because I don't know how a ranger does that with support. Yes, I
could learn, but my ranger would feel a bit stupid at her age asking how
it's done from people she doesn't know too well.  :/
