With the ( sometime in the future ) release of NwN, I am going to be in the 
market for a headset / software bundle to use in that game and others.  I 
need suggestions more for the software, as I'm fairly knowledgeable about 
headsets.

I've heard of Roger Wilco, and thought there was a MSoft product along 
these lines, but that's the sum of my knowledge on the software.

If you can tell me why you like a particular one, I would really appreciate 
it.  A product review would be awesome if you know of somewhere that has 
one.
