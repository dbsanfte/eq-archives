You are so crazy its not even funny . A true newbie that starts now will be
able to buy an 8/24 weapon by the time he is lvl 15 . When I leveled up my
first character lower guk was still a rumor and an 8/24 weapon was more than
any warrior could ever expect to achieve . Warrior dammage is based entirely
on the weapons they use . The trickle down effect of the economy has made
the game massively easier on the true newbie. I have played 2 twinks up
untwinked :P I know exactly how much easier it is . Any newbie complaining
today just has no idea of the ease they have . Warriors used to have to
group starting at level 15 ! today you see untwinked ones still soloing in
the 30s.
