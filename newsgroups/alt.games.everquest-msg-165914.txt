No, charisma only affects npc prices as far as your warrior is
concerned. It does not affect faction in anyway except that if you 
have a great faction with an npc vendor your charisma does not need to
be as high for max good prices. As far as faction the guards won't
care if your charisma is 200 or 1.

I assume you are referring to crustacean armor. Go ahead and buy it,
great stuff. My troll sk wore it until level 38 with a 4 charisma, for
the  most part this did not make low price items or FS sellables have
prices that were that different.

Invest in two of the charisma player made cheap stiens in the bazaar.
They have like 20 charisma each so you won't even have to remove the
armor. My troll sk did that and now that its outgrown crustacean plate
and moved to a barbed ringmail and such, with the two steins and a 9
charisma neck item it gets to 111 or so for NPC vendor buying/selling.
