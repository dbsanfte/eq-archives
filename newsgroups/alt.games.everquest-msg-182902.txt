It's hard not to reuse spells, since there aren't really all that many
(useful) things for a spell to do.  Take healing.  Basic idea: caster spends
some mana, and some healing happens.  Variations they can do on that theme,
to turn one basic idea into a bunch of spells:

1. Change the efficiency, so that low level spells in the line are not as
efficient as high level spells.

2. Change the casting time.

3. Instant healing vs heal over time vs. heal over very long time (e.g.,
regeneration type spells).

4. Make the healing come at the expense of someone else's health.  E.g.,
life taps or reverse life taps.

5. Combine with something else, sometimes beneficial (e.g., buff max HP in
addition to adding to current HP), sometimes detrimental (e.g., root target
for duration of a heal over time).

Before the new charm items, I don't think there was anything *new* in spells
in EQ for a long time.  Everything "new" was just variations on existing
spell abilities, using the above methods.
