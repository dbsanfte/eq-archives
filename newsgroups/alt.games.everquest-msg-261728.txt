Has anyone seen anything for the second rogue epic?  I've had my necro go to
Stanos, and he basically told me to find an associate of his and tell him
that the sun is setting on the horizon.

I've gone nearly everywhere I can think of - the rogues of Freeport (same
faction as Stanos, and the head rogue GM trained Stanos), the rogues of
Qeynos (he used to be from Qeynos, and his daughter's there), the female
Half Elf rogue in the Qeynos Aqueducts, the rogues of Kaladim (part of the
1st epic), the rogues of Halas, the bandit camps in East Karana, and the
rogues of Rivervale (Lendell Deepocket sends you to see Stanos).  I'm fresh
out of ideas.  Anyone try talking to Eldereth the Erudite in Lake Rathetear?
