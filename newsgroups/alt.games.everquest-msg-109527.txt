Their assertion that it is so does not make it true.  Their use of
the words does not of itself redefine my (or your) meaning for them.

It is a very long leap from acknowledging that context is necessary
to understand accurately the "goodness/evilness" of an act (or an idea,
or a policy, or ...), to insisting that context is the sole source
of the meaning of the terms.  Claiming the latter, as you do repeatedly
in this thread, is an act of faith, an assertion of your apparrent
belief that there is no definable concept of "evil", or its opposite
"good", that can serve as a basis for judgment.  The rest of what you've
posted here is nothing more than sophistry, essentially you're asserting
that your belief is correct with no more support than the fact that you
are more clever in your attacks on John's arguments than he was in
constructing them.  I am unimpressed, first because cleverness is no
virtue, and more importantly because it is far easier to attack an
argument than to construct one.

How does "Regardless of the 'feelings' or 'thoughts' of persons '#1'

or '#2'" not preclude your "Unless"?  Not that I agree with John's

example, most actions require context.

I can see that you claim that the idea of moral relativism embodies
truth while rejecting the notion of any concept of universal "good"
and "evil".  I can also see that you are very clever at attacking
others' arguments.  What I cannot see is where you have advanced a
single argument worth a damn in support of your claim.

I accept that a "good" person may believe it necessary in some
circumstance to do "evil", but I reject the notion that the "evil"
is therefore made "good".  The human condition is full of paradoxes,
using sophistry in an attempt to define them out of existence does
not alter reality any more than Newspeak's "War is Peace" and "Peace
is War" altered the imaginary "reality" in Orwell's 1984.
