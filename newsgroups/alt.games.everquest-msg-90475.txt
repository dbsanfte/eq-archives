Well, just to mention a few druid improvements after Luclin:
Better fee for porting (can easily get 100pp for each port in Bazaar, 
just bind there and make money).
Group Skins, cost me 700 mana to cast 6 skin like nature, cost me 400 for 1.
Group invis, INVALUABLE on raids where you have to be invis before you 
reach your destination.
Items with +% to meditate. When not maxed, this helps on getting mana back.
More FT items. Enuff said.
Nice new equipment (lets just mention the 10 wis tailored cloak, the 
ceremonial smudging stick (ok, mostly for resists, but still better than 
Seal of Thoridain).


The ONLY problems i have had with luclin are bad framerate (affects 
everyone), and the lack of ports on luclin (also affects everyone, 
although wizards can get to nexus from luclin).
