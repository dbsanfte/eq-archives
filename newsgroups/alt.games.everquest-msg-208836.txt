Fascinating list. With the exception of Have Spacesuit, I haven't read most
of those. Maybe I just had a bad run of Heinlein then... from my personal
reading...

I will fear no evil, Friday, The Number of the Beast, Puppet Masters, The
Menace from Earth, Farnhams Freehold, Stranger in a Strange land, The cat
who walked through walls, To sail beyond the sunset... had it.

vs ... Have Space Suit Will Travel, and the Sixth Column didn't (as near as
I can recall...)

Then again... interestingly, every single Heinlein you presented as smut
free that I overlooked are universally listed as his "Juveniles" series of
novels.... I'd say that explains the lack of 'adult content' there.

But thanks for the list, I might actually prefer his Juveniles novels...
