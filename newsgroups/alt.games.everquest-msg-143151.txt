Welcome aboard !!

Its true that EQ's been out for some time now, and that all servers
has a wide population level-wise.

But there's always new people starting, and experienced players starts
over on a new character, so theres a steady supply of characters on
your level that you can play with. Adventuring with experienced
players is a nice way to learn your way around Norrath.

As for your second question - Yes, theres newbie areas in the game
where newly created characters can adventure in somewhat safe
environments,

Good Luck with EQ
