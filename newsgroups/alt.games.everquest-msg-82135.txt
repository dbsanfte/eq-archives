If you are going for a dialup rather than Broadband then;

Claranet. www.clara.net
 Freetime (10) 14.99 month no cut off but excessive use will get you a slap
on the wrist and ask you to cut back or more to Freetime (5) 24.99 month no
cut off, as much use as you want.

Jolt. www.jolt.co.uk
Freetime 11.99 month, 24/7 access so far no cut off, as a gaming ISP (and a
good one) any cut off period would be in excess of 2hrs. Reports from FPS
gamers have been good so far on the service.
