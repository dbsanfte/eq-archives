Reality just set in.  Either he's not well versed in his role in the group
setting (i.e., he's trying to do too much), or his group is somewhere they
need not be, pulling mobs that are either too strong (require more of his
mana) or too weak (too many pulls in a row).  Or he's used the crutch of KEI
for so long that he's lousy at mana management.

In any case, his current playstyle does seem to be more suited to a game
where you replace mana with globes.

OTOH, if this is how he converses with folks, maybe not.
