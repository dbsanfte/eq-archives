    Congrats. So you can solo in zones that many folks don't visit. That
doesn't help classes that have to group to XP efficiently. Consider: if you
logged in and your favourite zone du jour was filled to the rafters with
folks, what would you do? Start advertising for that druid or wizard, and
start running. That's actually an OK solution in some places like Kunark,
where zones are arranged well as to difficulty. But in the old world? If you
saw Sol A was too crowded for your level 30 character when you logged on,
get on those running shoes.

    Or trying. I've done it myself, with a ready-made group, when we decided
we WERE going to do Sol A. The result? Well, if we logged on and the others
weren't there, time to play an alt. If everyone was there and farmers were
camping all of Sol A that day, time to play an alt. So maybe a third of the
time we'd actually get to play in Sol A. When I log on, I want to KNOW what
I'm going to do for the day, contingent on maybe whether friends are on or
not. That level of uncertainty was unacceptable to an EQ addict like me.
(Recently did my time /played on Delores alone - 96 days after two years of
EQ. I'd guesstimate I'll find out when I'm done that I've averaged 5 hours
per day over the past two years playing EQ. I know Rosy, my second highest
character, is in her mid-20's in days /played.)

    And I didn't even mention farmers! 8)
