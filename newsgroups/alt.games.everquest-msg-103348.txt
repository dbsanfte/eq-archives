I think the one with the problem is he who reflected himself upon the words
on the screen. Are you such a little girl that you can't handle a few lines
across a screen and had to go cry to a GM? Perhaps these quacks who were
speaking of uberness wanted the whole channel to hear them and join in. Who
are you to tell them they can't do that?

Rules are made by man. A thing with a heart.
