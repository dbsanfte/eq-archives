I remember asking someone for a rez once long ago.  They asked how I knew
they were a cleric since they were anon.

"/tell Healyou Call it a lucky guess."

Interestingly enough, you *can* guess that the anon people are clerics and
enchanters.  If I see an anon robe-wearer, it's an enchanter 99 times out of
100.  If I see an anon plate-wearer, it's a cleric 9,999 times out of 10k.
