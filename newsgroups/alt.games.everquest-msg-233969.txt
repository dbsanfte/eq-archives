Yup, just keep pounding.  I'm level 24 and have pushed it up to skill 85.
I have one hotkey that does "feign death, stand, instill doubt", and a
different one that does just "instill doubt" five times (with suitable
/pause in between).  Have to be careful with the latter since it ties up
ability to use other hotkeys while it runs, but it's great while waiting
for spires or while swimming across Timorous Deep.  (It looks really
silly doing the Instill Doubt martial swings while swimming, but it works.)
As Minotaur notes, your target doesn't have to be in range, so target an
NPC far enough away not to notice you, or target a corpse, or a boat, or
whatever.

Of course, I'm still not convinced that the skill is actually useful!
More often I'm having trouble chasing down a mob that wants to run away.
Seems like the last thing I need is a way of making them run sooner!

And yes, I can vouch for the warning against targetting the Nexus Scion
for ID. :-)
