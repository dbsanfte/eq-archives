What I got out of twinking was a walking advertisement for the Fine
Plate I was selling at the time (Miowara was wearing what I was
selling), and then when I stuck the full suit of Validus Custodes on
him, I wound up with a spiff-looking cat warrior with an unbuffed
strength in the 180's.  Basically he's a place to dump any Warrior
gear I happen to get.

But, since I am using him as a character, he's also near-max on 1HS,
rising on 1HB, maxxed on Taunt, Offense, Kick, and near-max on
Defense.  Just because he's a twink is no reason to let his skills get
sloughed.
