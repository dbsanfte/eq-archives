You don't have to purchase it.

That's where your head's stuffed in your ass, junior.  The software is free.
Hell, they even have free rooms now, so "rookies" (hehe... If you only knew,
Sparky) like yourself can get to  know the game (it IS a game, by the way).

Besides, when I go to a "flight sim", I'll stick with CFS and CFS2.  I'm
afraid AW's just a little too "cartoon" for me.

Take care, junior.

Rookie...  That's rich.  LOL
