Is it just me or does everyone have some sense that something very bad is going
to happen tomorrow when president Bush visits NYC?

Im not psychic or anything, but i just have this feeling that him going to NYC
isnt a very good idea, and for some reason I feel that tomorrow anyone in NYC
isnt a good idea. 

Is anyone else having these..........i dont know what to say but feelings?
