LOL at 50p I don't think badly of anyone for more than a few seconds...I'm
too old to remember names of marginal (aka "standard") donors.

The worst offenders I remember (well, they're on my ignore list
anyway)...and the worst guilds.  I will not KEI Descending Darkness members
unless I get paid up front.  I ignore tells from people in my zone if
they're anon and the zone is a favorite for druids (after all, ironically,
they're almost always anon/role to avoid the very thing they've just done)
unless they're willing to pay a lot and mention it up front.

Some goober /ooc' that he's paying "very well" for KEI...so I KEId him...and
got 25p.  Wow.  I'm rich...RICH I tell you!

Then again, I'm also of the opinion that druids and wizards get ripped off
for less than 25p per group port, even though I RARELY port for donations
myself (though my wizard will ALWAYS ALWAYS charge for TLs to zones that
cost me money in reagent, but as long as he gets a few plat he's happy).  If
you can't afford 25p to save you a little time, it's time to take up
jogging. <g>
