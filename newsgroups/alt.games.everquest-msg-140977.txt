Not true, really. We were camping fire giants just this week out of
boredom and looking for xp and I was landing Ice Comets on the fire
giants from nearly max range. They weren't debuffed that much either.
I've also hit Vox from well beyond melee range, but get resisted much
more often, so I tended to run up on top of her anyway.

That was just special code put in only for Naggy and Vox after Kunark
came out. Those dragons were designed for a time when people could only
be as high as level fifty. When it became clear that one group of high
levels could smoke them, the level limit code was put in. Trust me, I've
been banished by Vox many times while trying to help our lower level
members on a raid setup. he he.

That's a heck of a good faction hit. :-)

The dragons will love you for it. The giants might frown at you, though.
