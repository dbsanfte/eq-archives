It is a vast improvement over previous charm spells.  That in itself
might not be a problem, but couple it with the mobs in PoP and it is.

Taking enchanters as the example, prior to PoP, the highest level
general purpose charm spell they used worked on mobs up to level 53/54,
and checked at -10 MR.  The only way to charm something close to your
level pre-PoP was to use Dictate, which is a fixed length 8 tick charm
with a 5min refresh.  Not something you could use to xp with, and really
because of a lot of nerfing, not something you could use to help much on
raids either.

Command of Druzzil, the level 64 PoP enchanter charm spell, works on
NPCs up to level 63/64 and can last up to 7.5mins, checking at -50 MR.
So, that spell is a huge upgrade to BA, the level 53 charm mentioned
above. They also got a line of AAs called Total Domination that makes
charm spells less likely to wear off early.

Its easy for a chanter to go into any tier2+ PoP zone and grab a pet
that hits for 500+, and then haste it on top of that.  Then you have a
'pet' that will outdamage an entire group of L65 PCs.  In addition to
racking up AAs in less than 30 mins, there are encounters that 1-2
people with charm and a healer and a snarer can do that two full groups
couldnt accomplish w/o charm.
