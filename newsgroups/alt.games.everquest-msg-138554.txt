This looked like it might relate to that:

About 1/4 of the way down the scrollbar, heading is 'Biology and 
Personality'. Although most of the page seems relevant to this discussion.

It refers to a Nature article by Zhou... hm, one year too old for their 
online archives, how inconvenient.  Whoa, ok, here's a review of the 
literature up to late 1999.

This strikes me as a key quote:

"Implicit in the above hypothesis is the assumption that the end product 
of sex-atypical neuroendocrine differentiation is sex-atypical behavior, 
namely, a homosexual orientation. But is neuroendocrine differentiation a 
cause or a consequence of behavior? Although it is clear that such events 
occur in prenatal life and have subsequent influences on behavior, certain 
postnatal psychosocial inputs may alter responsivity to neurohormonal 
events. In addition, the differential development posited may not be 
causal, but correlational."

Sheesh, I -do- wish I'd paid more attention in neuroanatomy class, I'm 
getting lost in these abbreviations for brain regions. :)

The strongest criticism I've seen of these types of study so far, I think, 
is here:
