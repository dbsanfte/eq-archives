You get a lot of idiots in the game that think the only useful point of an
Enchanter is the breeze line. Screw 'em. Keep looking for groups and you'll
get one. The Languid pace is a slow spell, it makes the mob attack less so
save damage to your fighters. You are doing exactly what a chanter should do
and that is crowd control, Mezzing.

The low levels are difficult but get less difficult the higher you go, no
matter if your lvl 15 or lvl 55, you still get killed a lot.

Keep at it, fun class to play and do not bother wasting plat on the soothe
line of spells, they are broken and cause more aggro than they are worth
