Begging is a taunt I was talking to a GM about Monks, Being though they are
Tanks they should be given the taunt skill. The GM told me to use the
begging and disarm skill this will have a very good Taunting effevt on the
mobs. I have a begging skill of 130 something and the most I have every
gotten was 1sp and 2cp from begging after paying me the mob proceeded to
attack.
