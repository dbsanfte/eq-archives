I agree.  If God is omniscient, then he already knows what you need,
you don't have to ask for it through prayer.  (Unless, of course, he
*wants* you to ask.  I'm not sure why he'd want you to ask, though.)

However, that being said, I can think of a few reasons prayer may be
a valuable thing:

1. It fulfills some psychological need on behalf of the prayer.  You
   feel as if someone is listening to you, as if someone truly cares.
   In this scenario, God is playing the role of a parent figure, who
   loves you unconditionally and understands.

2. "Articulating" your thoughts through prayer helps you think things
   through more carefully; i.e., it helps you figure out what you
   really do want, what you really don't want, how you really feel
   about things, etc.

I don't believe in worship praying.  I think of God in terms of a
parent figure.  I don't think (sane) parents want their children to
worship them.  I don't think (sane) people want to be worshipped.

I can't fathom why God would want to be worshipped, either.  In fact,
I'd find it kind of insulting, in a "brown noser" sort of way.
