I know its been out for a while but from what I have seen in the past with
collector's editions are last ditch efforts to milk more money out of the
fan base. Lets take at look back Command & Conquer, C&C exp1 with new
vehicles, C&C exp 2 with more new units. C&C Gold edition, C&C Warchest
(C&C, C&C exp1, C&C exp2). Now lets put this in a movie context Star Wars,
Empire Strikes Back, Return of the Jedi. Collectors Edition, New Collectors
Edition with new never before seen footage. Digitally remastered Collectors
Edition. Can we expect Everquest Digitally remastered with new never before
seen Characters?
