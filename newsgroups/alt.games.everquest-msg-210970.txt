I had this very thing happen with my cleric (imagine having a 30 second
delay from casting a heal and it actually beginning to cast, NOT a good
thing at all) and after MUCH troubleshooting (from moving cards to change
IRQ's to formatting my machine to just about anything else) it turned out to
be my internet connection.  I have Cable and where I am supposed to get
750mbps-1500mbps download I was registering 200-300 or so on speed test
websites.  Had a few techies from Comcast come down and finally found out it
was a glitch in the very small local area I was in.  After they fixed it,
I've had no problems whatsoever.

Try going to www.dslreports.com or www.2wire.com and run the speed tests
there.  DSLReports is much more reliable but you can only run 3 tests at a
time and it only allows a certain number of people to run tests at any given
time so try late at night or use 2wire to get a general estimate but not as
accurate.  Compare your tested speed with what your ISP is telling you that
you should be getting and see if the two gel.  If not, your connection is
causing your problem.
