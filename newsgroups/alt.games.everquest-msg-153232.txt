1. Get a "swarm" of creatures mad at you.....
2. Charm 1 of them and let the mob of creatures beat it down. 
3. When it is near death (and charm has broken) Chant Kite/Bellow to
finish it off.
4. Rinse and Repeat until swarm is dead.

In order to pull this off you need to agro the mobs without "agro'ing"
the mobs. If you generate too much hate, then the "swarm" might ignore
your pet and keep chasing you. The best way to accomplish this is to
use proximity agro (run up to a KoS mob), or to "whiff" with a H2H
attack on a non-KoS mob.

It's really no different than Charm kiting. Just larger in scale.
