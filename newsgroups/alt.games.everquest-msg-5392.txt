If the alleged person never goes away by your theory then he is not a
troll, and the identified disrupters are real. I could possibly make and
endless list as to why the EQng has become so attractive to many people
but I would have thought it was obvious. Nothing is accomplished by
labeling people all the wrong things. If Lokari wasn't a fatass, if
bizbee wasn't a little dweeb, and if some others here really weren't
nerds I would imagine no response would have been had. What those are
fighting is not me, it's their own truth and their own dissatisfaction
with themselves. Just saying. This I could have said from the beginning.
