It's likely that many claim it is not a taunt because it is
inefficient. I view it as "Every little bit helps". My hit may not do
it, my Taunt may not do it, and my beg may not do it. But maybe my
hit/taunt/beg together is enough hate to tip the scale. I have pulled
a goblin off a cleric and got the "Beggars like you" message, so I
think it is a taunt, albeit not a very good one.
