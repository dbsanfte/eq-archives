You know, I don't think Japan's lesson WAS forgotten.  
I'm fairly sure many Japanese Americans still harbor a 
lot of hate due to the treatment they recieved.  And 
now, it looks like a lot of other nationalities are 
getting a taste of the same thing.  ::points to the 
stories of beatings, fires, and shootings already 
happening in the US::

Good thing America is a place of justice, huh?

I mean, what don't you understand about "violence begets 
violence"?  Like they care if you raze their nation?  
That only makes their movement stronger.

Let's take it back a little, to what mother used to say: 
Two Wrongs Do Not Make A Right.
