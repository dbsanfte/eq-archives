Although no one really likes cheats anywhere, in a game like EQ (and on a
blue server, which you are) they are cheating no one, it is not a race, it's
a journey where you are meant to make friends and ignore/avoid idiots (not
make enemies). There is no contest, to achieve anything in this game, large
groups of people have to work as a team to overcome what Verant/SOE put up
against them. Let the game designers worry about cheats, you just enjoy
yourself.
