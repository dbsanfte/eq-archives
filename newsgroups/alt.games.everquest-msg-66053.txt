Others have mentioned (no idea of the accuracy of the date, I don't feel
like researching it) that as of 3 weeks from now Win95 is no longer
supported at all.  If this date is correct, Microsoft decided to cut corners
and stop DX supporting early.

Microsoft also nags WinXP users TO DEATH to create a fucking passport
account where it has ZERO right to do it (what Passport and the OPERATING
SYSTEM have to do with each other, I don't think I'll ever know) and no way
of telling XP to go fuck off and stop bothering me (I don't care if you can
create a bullshit passport account to get them off your back...the point is,
they shouldn't be harassing me in the first place).  To me this is a much
bigger reason to sue Microsoft but hell, might as well lump the two
together.
