I am not sure about the pet thing.  I do know that mobs do not con
indifferent.  Say that I am a half-elf in Nek Forest the guards con ready to
attack.  GM's just don't agro them.  However if a Gm were to attack a
creature it would bring all his friends with.  You know how you cannot kill
a GM's on a PvP server.  This in not totally true.  If a GM goes LD they
lose there GM status.  This means that until they log off the server they
can be attacked and mobs also agro them.
