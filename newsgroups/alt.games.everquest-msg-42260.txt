The problem is these web sites got too big for their own britches.

Everything was fine when they were small but they got bucks from
all the adds and decided to make money and become businesses.
Then the bottom dropped out of the internet click-thru stuff and banner
adds. Now they cry that their bandwidth costs thousands of dollars
'we' somehow have to support them. Huh?

More than half of the crap and graphics downloaded from these sites
is just that 'crap.' All that mega bandwidth that costs 'thousands' of dollars
is bullshit. All I want is a simple text site. But noooooooo we have to have
all these graphics, and banners, and bullshit comments from d00ds saying
how uber an item is or boasting and name calling blather. Maybe if they
wrote tighter html code, and try NOT loading a new friggin' page for every
click?
