    Teabomb was born circa 9-11-01.  I thought that the 
"bomb" part was appropriate for a wizard (still do), but
it still gave me a hollow feeling in the pit of my 
stomach after the attack.  But I decided not to let a
bunch of murderous religious fanatics in a far away land
force met to change her name or delete her.
