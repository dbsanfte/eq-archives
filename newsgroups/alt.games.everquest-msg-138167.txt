 I just read this:

The reward for turning in the head of Yollis Jenkins is not the Pine Scout
Longsword, but a rusty pine scout sword.  This is an ingredient for the
quest for the actual Pine Scout Longsword.

You must first sharpen the rusty sword in a forge with a sharpening stone
(obtainable in Halas), and return it to Errin Pinewhisper along with a Large
King Snake Skin and a Gnoll Fang. He will then hand you back the Pine Scout
Longsword, which is Lore, No Drop and Magic.
