What filtering is required? The only filtering I can think of would be to
remove players from tracking, and even BARDS can do that. Anything else in
the zone would be relevant to track. The only exceptions would be tunare or
thirneg or other static spawns, and not even rangers can eliminate specific
mobs by name from their sort list.

So you are the type who doesn't recognize sarcasm when it lands on your
face, wiggles, and leaves a slimey residue, eh?

The only raids I know of who get "saddled" with extra druids are fear
raids.
