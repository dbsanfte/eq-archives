I was in everfrost and spotted a 36 shaman, and decided to have some fun, so
challenged her to a duel. She accepted and i managed a feeble swing. Lo, the
guard shouted something about a guild, hit me, then ran away. I ran to the
zoneline just in case, but he seemed cotent to do whatever the heck he was
doing.

So the question is, why did he run away, and what was that about a guild?
Did he go attack the shaman guild our of pure bloodlust or something? I
finished the duel next to the zoneline, but he never came back, and i hope
he didn't perish at the hands of a horde of angry shaman. Maybe he just lost
his way, and even now is charging madly through halas?

I lost the duel, but that's the wonderful thing about a level 7 warrior;
death is just cheap transportation...
