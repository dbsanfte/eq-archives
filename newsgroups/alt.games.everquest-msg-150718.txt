Thats easy run around them until they are tightly packed as mentioned
somewhere else the time taken to achieve this is rarely a issue as druids
snares last a long time. so where you get its unlikely that we get them all

them packed close you can ae them to your hearts content you just have to
make sure you have enough distance to get ae off b4 they reach you.
