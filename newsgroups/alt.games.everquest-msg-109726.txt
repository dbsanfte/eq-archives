The Nazi's killed millions of Jewish because they were seen as a
weakness in society - greed, corruption, and an evil. Yes, they
beleived the Jewish to be evil. 

The Nazi's considered themselves the "master race", and thus, all
others were inferior. The beleived they were entitled basicly to rule
the world because of this.

Survival of the fittest.
