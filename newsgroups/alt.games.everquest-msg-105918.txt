Level makes a difference. In the 20s, for instance, clerics -- the gods
of the high end game -- often have a lot of trouble getting groups 
because groups all want druids/shamans instead for the holy SoW.

Fortunately for clerics, this problem rapidly clears up after level 30
when rangers and beastlords can provide the SoW, and clerics are gaining
healing power while druids/shamans are stuck in the GHeal rut. But in
the lemming-infested outdoor leveling zones (FM, OT, DL) druids still
get snapped up pretty fast. It's beyond Dreadlands that they're 
bitching about.
