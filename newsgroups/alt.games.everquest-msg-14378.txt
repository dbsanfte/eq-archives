I never did find any of the shaman. I finally gave up a while ago and
just bought all the heads.

I have yet to see any of them. I was there for 3 days waiting, none
ever popped, including Ghanex Drah ( who used to be there all the time
).

I am just hanging around in SK now waiting to turn in my items for the
needle from Brother Qwinn. That is almost as much fun as watching
paint dry ;)
