Back?  No, never tried it to my recollection, always meant to but never got
around to it till now.

Can you go in raid mode with a single player?

Met up with Teapray and Lennie late tonight and got a massive infusion of
languages, the main ones to 100 and the rest to at least a smattering, which
should help lots.

So its not broken[anymore?] (which you know but the rest of the AGE
population might not)

Beastlord with shaman is like giving the beastlord a level boost, and you
could play MA with your pet and mine sharing out the damage.  You'd have the
same heal as the shaman (inner fire is the heal of choice till over 20)
Seems like a plan, only problem is I'll be offline for the next week and the
shaman might be level 15 by then for all I know, thats why I've been
leveling freely despite the fact that she's only just hit 5... figure she'll
lap me and I'll have to play catchup either way.
