Not at all.

Anyone who wants to check the auctions chat just has to say
"/join auction".  If they're the first one in (like right
after the systems come up, it'll create the chat room.
If not, they'll join the existing one.

Piece of cake.

On Quellious there are already about 50 people in the
auction chatroom, despite it being the middle of the night,
and the first day the feature has been available (more
people will check in as word of mouth spreads).
