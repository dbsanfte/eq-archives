That is a question that can only be answered by the player behind the
character. I personally enjoy the journey up through the levels. I
have PL'd several characters to their mid-30s in the past, only to
discover that I had no real "connection" to them. No
history..backstory...or friends..etc. In the end I always wind up
deleting them. For me the "journey" is what is important than the
destination.

>fend off a mob half their level?

Actually, it is the opposite.....With Druid PLing (Damage Shield,
Regen, HP buffs), the PL'd character stands toe-to-toe with several
mobs at a time (usually yellow/red) getting beat on. Offense, Defense,
and Weapon skills max VERY quickly. In fact my PL'd characters always
finished with maxed combat skills, even the INT casters.

>Doesn't it take an extremely long time for all skills to catch up? 

No. Melee's will have all of the primary skills maxed, and
casters/hybrids only need to spend a couple of hours chain casting low
level spells to get thier spell skills up. (extremely trivial with
KEI)

>just levelling up normally with good gear?

It really depends on the person. If "fun" means playing at the 50-65
level, then the sooner you get to those levels the more enjoyment you
will get out of the game. If "fun" is the journey 1-65, then PLing
will most likely be a waste of time for you.

>What's the motivation for extreme powerlevelling?

1. Catch up to friends with a different class than your main
2. Skip over level ranges that are not fun for you
3. Create a "mule" Port, Rez, Clarity, Heal, etc (before PoP
Port-Mules were extremely popular)
4. Be the first to 65 with a new class/race
