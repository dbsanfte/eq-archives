I, for one, wish they had had this in january. Restarting a level 10
warrior was no big deal, but I would gladly have paid 50 dollars to
get my then nearly 40 druid off my ex's account instead of having to
spend 3-4 months leveling up to where I could group with old friends
again. (Even though my current guild, which I probably wouldn't have
hooked up with without my reroll, does make up for it :) )
