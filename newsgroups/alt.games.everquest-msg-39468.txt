I'm not sure if I would explicitly say that resist is most important in
planes.
for mele-types, ac would seem to be most benificial.

However, with that said, alot of 'uber' guilds require 100+ SV all.

Typicaly, for dragon raids, you need magic and an element (cold or fire) to
be over 100.  The exception is trakanon, who uses poision.

As I can recall, when we did faydadar the other day, I had magic resist of
148 and fire of exactly 200.

Even with fire resistance of 200, fadadar was nuking me for about 150 or so.
Which is alot better than the 500 most dragon AoEs do.
