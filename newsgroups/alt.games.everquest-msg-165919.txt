I did answer you just dont pay attention
I never said the game sucked 
I said one particular aspect of it did, the long camping time needed to 
get anything in the game.
With regard to deleting my characters yes i am having some regrets
Mostly because i should maybe have just taken a long break from the game
but in the end that would be pointless
When i return the long camping will still be in the game so nothing will 
have changed.
And the other reason i have any regret is because of the time i invested 
getting the char to level 51
This however was rewarding and enjoyable.
I could have maybe continued playing the game but just not bothered with 
the long camps but im sure there would be sometime in the future that 
ill needed to camp something forever, maybe in the epic

Ive found it fascinating how many posts have been generated from my 
initial post.
Some of support, some from people with no life
I find it hard to understand how some of you can describe my compalint 
as a whine. What the fuck are you people on if you dont also get unhappy 
at camping a mob for 10 hours with little success?
Are there lifes so empty that spending 10 hours doing this is acceptable 
to them?
Come on get a grip.
