Sometimes, I'm just too worn out to bother being group leader.  I'd rather
sit and chat with friends while on LFG on the off chance someone wants me.
If they do, great; if not, well, I got to talk to my friends or do some
tradeskills.

If that new leadership XP thing gives folks extra XP for being group leader
or somesuch, you can bet that the situation will be resolved.  Or reversed,
where no one wants to join, everyone wants to *lead.*
