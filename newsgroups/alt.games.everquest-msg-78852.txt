Hi all,

I have recently tried to play both Everquest and Dark Age of Camelot (beta)
online, but for both games I have suffered a 'deadlink' or 'disconnection'
problem. Normally around 15~20 mins into play, the game reports that I have
lost connection. After this time I lose all of my internet services ( ie I
cannot browse the web or collect e-mail, my computer doesn't even shut down
properly when I try to reboot).The little green monitors on the bottom right
of the task bar are still there, but nothings happening.This onlt seems to
happen after I attempt to play either of these games. I get EXACTLY the same
symptoms for both games, which points the problem being with BTOpenworld
(ADSL).

I am posting here in case any of you might be able to help. I find that
normally the newsgroups are much better than any support I might hope to get
from BT.

Other online games I have played include Counter-Strike, Diablo2 and Age of
Kings, all without a hitch. Everquest and DAoC are very similar games, and
share the same problem, surely not a coincidence....*think aloud* its just
struck me that both games will require accounts with monthly payments,
whereas the other online games I have tried do not...

I am running WIN98SE
800MHz Athlon
Geforce2 400MX card
Alcatel ADSL modem

There's a cyber drink in it for the person who can help me!

Thanks

Warren....
feel free to e-mail me at warren@rolfey.co.uk that way I will get any
replies for sure..
