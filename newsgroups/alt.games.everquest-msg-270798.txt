Although it's purely speculation I would not be surprised to see the 
total number of EQLive subscriptions fall by about 50% over the coming 
calendar year, perhaps even a bit more. Unlike times gone by there are 
now a good variety of genuine competitors out there and given how time 
consuming these games are most people are going to play no more than one 
or perhaps two of them. And then there are some major releases on the 
horizon as well such as D&D online and LoTR that Turbine is developing 
although who knows when we might see them.

It would be so interesting to see what the number of subscriptions for 
EQLive is right now, wouldn't it? Without question there has been 
something of an exodus for other games. I just wonder how much? Even 
Stromm has been affected with many weaker guilds falling apart, although 
it really hasn't seemed all that noticeable to me in terms of there 
still be lots of people around wherever I go at all times of night and 
day. I imagine the impact on older servers though has been a lot more 
dramatic.

Has anyone heard anything about server consolidations for EQLive yet? 
You'd think they would do something sometime soon for those servers 
who's populations have fallen significantly over time. Why the hell 
would they want to continue to run some 50 of them or so when they could 
probably go down to say 35 right now perhaps or maybe less. If they 
allow the numbers to dwindle in some of the worlds for too long they'll 
just lose those people to other games most likely I would think.
