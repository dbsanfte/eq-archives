i was doing Nro (takish) Ldons to get points for RGC and a nice druid
DOT they sell for 650.
I was at 632 points and i won a Ldon but .. no points awarded i stayed
at 632. No cigar.
Then i noticed in my LDON stats that i was 632 pts also in MMC.
of course i petitioned and i got back the totally (imho) answer that 
GM's "cannot do anything about your lost LDON points" and " you can
report the bug with ?bug" etc.
 I suspect that i have lost points in MMC too.
I did one LDon after that in EF and i got my 51 pts OK but i was low
there . lower than 632.

Anyone experienced same problem?
