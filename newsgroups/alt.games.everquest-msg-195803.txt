Killing halflings is never to no avail ;)

The snare lasts about 15-30 seconds on it depending on level, taking 6
seconds to cast - almost always interrupted if you are in mele range,
and too long to cast if kiting.  It's also only a 25% snare, I found it
totally useless for fear kiting.  The only use I've found for it so far
has been snaring in a group without a snarer to prevent trains,
otherwize root is more effective.  But it's something to do, and not
totally useless, just mostly :)  plus the looks you get when you say
don't root, I'm snaring!  and they reply - since when can clerics (de
cleric here) snare?!?!  

The pally at the end of the quest is very hard solo at lv 25.  But I'd
do the intermediate parts as soon as you are able, I waited until the
halfling who you have to kill for the mask turn in was green to me, and
it was booring as hell - except for this one wanderer who was a nasty
red...

Bah, up to 20 shaman are still equal to any hybrid for melee.  Get
yourself a cheap 2hb and wail away like a pro golfer!  Plus if you are
not going the insane kei route you've still got the most mana efficient
heal (if slow) of any lv 18 or lower, inner fire, as long as you don't
let any stupid clerics buff you.

Was thinking of starting up my shaman again.  my first over 30 character
- pre kunark - was a barb shammy, but I really wanted to be a lizy so
deleted here, I didn't care for my lizy, so deleted her as well,
thinking of going the power gamer troll route now...
