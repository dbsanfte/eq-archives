>What should the next playable race be?

Snip.

Some of these won't make it since they are too close to vah shir. They
try to have very different new races, since the memory space is
limited. One new race has a ton of new possible texture looks, loading
down everyone who plays the game. This is why they went from iksar, to
Vah shir, then to froglok. All three are different. 

So they likely won't have Ottermen, Gnoll, kobold or minotaur, already
did a furry type race recently with the vah shir. They won't do Lizard
men or a dragon race, already did iskar. They might do something like
Orc or goblin, except they are sort of regular humanoid types which
we've already seen in the game a lot (though froglok was too.) 

Of all the ones you mention, Aviak is the most likely. Its a bird type
race, so like the other new races it fits the mold of something new.
They have not done a bird type race. 

Centaur is the most unlikely, due to it having to have a larger
bounding box. It may even have to be larger than the ogre or trolls,
meaning it would have more trouble in small areas. The final strike
against centaur is that it would likely be faster at running than
other races, giving it the first real racial advantage. This would be
impossible to balance retroactively, so I don't think we'll ever see a
horse/man hybrid type, or  "mount" PC character. A game like World of
Warcraft, just starting, can balance races so that the Tauren's
ability of plains running is balanced out, EQ can't do that. 

The biggest hurdle is that races don't add anything to the game. They
are only cosmetic, with pretty much no advantage or difference.  You
have Vah shir which are essentially Barbarians in kitty suits, with
slightly higher dex and agil, no racial slam and infravision. Yay.
You get the froglok with pretty average stats, being more unique for
the fact that it is the only race that can field a shaman AND a cleric
more than it is for the slightly longer breathing time underwater.

My prediction, if they bothered, would be an aviak type. It just seems
the most different from currently existing types, which fits the mold
of what they have been doing. There was no furry mammal, no reptile,
no amphibian before those player races came along. There is also no
avian player type.
