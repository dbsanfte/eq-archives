Patch server has been getting hammered all afternoon, Jazz.  I fianlly got
connected about 3 hours ago.  When I get a file, I get it dang fast ... just
aren't getting them too often.

I don't ever remember the patch server getting this gorked up.  Makes one
wonder if maybe a patch this big should've been handled more like the way
they handled the pre-Luclin patches ... ship the new UI a little bit at a
time over a series of three or four days.  Then on the last day, ship the
version of eqgame.exe that actually allows utilization of the new UI.

Just a thought, hindsight being 20-20, and all ... :-)
