If have had conflicting advice on when to starting doing more AA levels. I
already gained run3 and regen3 around level 56 and was thinking about
obtaining SCM3 and possibly Mental Clarity. A few people have told me to
wait until 65 as AA levels are so easy to obtain then while others have said
they are easier at 62 which is where I am now.

Any suggestions please?
