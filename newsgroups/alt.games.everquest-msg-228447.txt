Up to this point, bard lull has been lasting a *very* long. I haven't put 
any effort into trying to determine exactly how long, but I have been 
able to lull rooms full (4-5 or so) and easily pull the remainder. Lulls 
have even lasted through our killing one of the mobs so that when I went 
back after another, they were still lulled.

I'm hearing they will be fixing this soon (12/16?), however, so I'll just 
have to wait and see how it goes.
