Is there anywhere that has a list of what they drop ? So far i've
gotten the sword, bow (really wanted these two), the shawl, necklace
and a ring.

I been soloing them with my druid, pull them to the zone edge, kill
the adds with a earthquake, then kill the commander.... look for any
good loot, and then relog with my ranger and loot :)

Play from Australia I pretty much have them all to myself in our night
time.

I don't think they do. I've done them the last 3 nights with the zone
to myself, and once the commanders are dead I never see them
re-appear.

Cheers,
