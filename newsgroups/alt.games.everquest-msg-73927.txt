agreed.  often you will have groups that either work or have members who
just hate each other.

greediness is wanting to survive?  I can understand if your in a group who
seems unorganized and it bugs you to have to listen to constant demands for
various spells, gets a little tedious.  Rather just have the casters
continually cast needed spells on everyone.  Even my enchanter isn't perfect
on this, although almost always I do automate clarity / C2 where I cast it
on myself then on everyone else, so when it wears off on myself I know its
going to wear off on everyone else.  Still have to listen to people who need
that crack and don't wanna go moments with it off.

Loot rules should be decided ahead of time.  If your not happy with how loot
is being divided, you need to discuss it before the event occurs.  Most
higher level places (50 +) go with Need Before Greed.  Can recall many a
times where loot wasn't really divided fairly.  remember this one wizard who
even though I was going to get someone to join us and the archmage showed
up, he wouldn't even give me a roll to get it.  Something about another high
level gave him our camp's loot, so I shouldn't get a roll.  I forget the
name of that wizard, wondering if he is still on my don't talk to list.

If your doing the FFA system, you definitely wanna allow others to loot.
even with that system, if your hogging then you need to be called on it (and
often are).  probably one of the problems with the system itself.  You
should also be trying to let others loot so you don't get called on it and
look like a hogger.  Special drops even in a FFA should be rolled on by the
group.

groups who are pushing themselves can earn a ton more exp than soloing, even
with a few single deaths.  one extreme example of this is an AE group.
