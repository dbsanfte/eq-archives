There's a few stages to EQ:

Levels 1-4 "Lord, PLEASE let em level and get away from these n00bS"

Levels 5-12 Hey, this game is pretty cool!

Levels 13-23 This game is BORING, this sucks, I hate this!

Levels 24-29 Hmmm, I takse that back, this game is REALLY getting cool!

Level 30 WHAT IN THE F**K?!

31-50 This REALLY ROCKS!! I LOVE EQ!!!

50+ Lord PLEASE get me away from these people!


ALL classes are very similar until level 10.  Same basic strategy for all of
em.  It REALLY isn't until post 25-30 that you start to shine in your
particular class.  The 13-23 range is definitely hte most difficult to stick
out.  I myself have a few mid teens, and only one post 30 character.  I'm
now starting a new bard, and already have him up to level 8.

The trick is, you MUST stick one out or you'll be doomed to repeat
EVERYTHING over and over and over ad infinitum.
