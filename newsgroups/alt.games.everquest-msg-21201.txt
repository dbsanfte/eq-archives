(and *yes*... there's a bad attempt at a poorly crafted play on words
coming, related to the title. You've been warned.)

While this will doubtless be *yawn* "old hat" stuff to all you veterans,
it may be of amusement to any newer folks.  If you've yet to get to
Vellious or haven't yet gotten a character up to the level to try a
Naggy raid or such, you may (like me) have a keen interest in dragons,
and look forward to someday seeing and battling them. Well, I *still*
haven't taken on a *real* dragon, but over the last few days we've had
the opportunity to fight some of their scaley, smaller relatives.
Between Kodiak pulls, I've been grabbing a few Younger and Elder
Shardwurms, and DAMN but they look like a dragon to me! Very cool. Now,
being a Troll, I'm used to being one of the bigger things around in most
zones.  I knew that the shards were big, but I never knew exactly *HOW*
big these bad boys were until I looked at the following picture:

My good friend and sneaky rogue Orlun took this shot while we were
battling one the other night. The size comparison between my troll and
this mob is just staggering, and this is one of the best shots any of us
got to illustrate this "matter of scale". (Groan.... yes, I warned
you.)  Anyway, enjoy.  If you look *very* closely, you can also get a
sense for the additional difference in size between the wurm and a dwarf
rogue and a dwarf cleric (standing behind the mob, and behin me,
respectively.) If I'd known the sucker was that big, I might not have
pulled it. (But yes, we killed it.)
