I'm guessing the reason they ignore the z axis is so that players cannot "perch"
and kill mobs without mobs being able to attack back.  This obviously isn't
working quite right as it makes it possible for things like this to happen.  Why
not reverse it, but program it so that if a mob cannot hit a player due to
elevation issues, the mob drops no loot and gives no exp?
