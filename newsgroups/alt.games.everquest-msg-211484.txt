I agree, BUT, you're only stuck with the earth pet for 5 levels.
Keep a damage shield on him, and his DPS is "good enough".  Instead
of healing, you can nuke a little more freely due to his root.

I'll admit this sucks compared to having one of the other pets, but
for me at least, doing the mage research sucks even more.

I wish SOE would give mages the root spell and modify the earth pet
to cast snare instead.  A lack of any kind of CC really hurts mages.
And giving the earth pet snare would actually make the earth pet
useful.

Ah, in that case, the research is probably worthwhile.
