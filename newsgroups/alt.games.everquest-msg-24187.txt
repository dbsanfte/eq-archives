I have a few friends who play Everquest... they have gone from being
social human beings, to people entirely devoid of any redeeming
quality.  A buddy of mine and I checked their play log, or whatever
you call it... they average 8-10 hours a day of play. That is sick. I
can understand playing a video for a couple of hours, then turning in,
but that long!?!? Are all you people that pathetic?  Do you people not
have any desire to do anything productive?  Life affirming?
I could maybe come close to understanding if the game was good, like
Gran Turismo 2, but I think I'm missing something... are you people
aware that the sounds, graphics, music are all crap?  That the combat
"simulation", if you can even call if that, is worse than Wolfenstein
3d?
I've read articles about people who have lost marriages and friends to
this game... I am sure that some of you people have... is it worth it?
I strongly recommend that you people get the fuck away from your
computers for a second and smell a rose, drink a beer, kiss your
wives/girlfriends or do whatever you people liked to do (if you can
even remember) before you started on this game.
Have a nice day.
