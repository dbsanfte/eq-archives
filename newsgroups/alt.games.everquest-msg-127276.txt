Yeah, you must have a really crappy weapon because at level 33 I was getting
a lot of BS's in the 130-150 range.  With buffs as high as 180.  I think my
max so far with buffs was about 204 at 37th level.

May I suggest a Sturdy Grimling Mining Pick.  It is not magical, but has
great stats for BSing and is not very expensive.  That is what I use in my
primary slot unless I am in situations that require a magic weapon.  They
are a fairly common drop in The Grimling Forest so you could hang out around
there and probably pick one up for around 50pp or so.
