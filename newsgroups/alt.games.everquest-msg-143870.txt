 Hey, here's an idea. If that was the case, and not some buggy behavior
of which VT is full of (so I hear), how about giving them a warning and
suggest they should try again? It's entirely possible to believe your
strategy is kosher yet have Verant not agree. How about giving the
people who are actually spending the time (thanks timesinks) to
beta-test your buggy, incomplete upper level game the benefit of the
doubt? Oh gee, that's too much to ask.
