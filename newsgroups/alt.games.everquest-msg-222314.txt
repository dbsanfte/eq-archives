And to a large extent I would agree, when its abused to get players 
something they have no ability to earn on their own.

But some spwans/drops are so rare its nonsensical to expect players to 
actually camp them all. (Nonsensical to me at least; SoE thinks a lot is 
reasonable that i do not.)

What quest? Are the items Lore and No Drop? If they're just lore, you 
can get away with the shared bank slot, or your 'partner' can just hand 
you the second item. Which makes MQ not a strict requirement. (Relying 
on an NPC to not get reset by another player while you go out hunting 
notwithstanding)
