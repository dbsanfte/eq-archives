"Eat me!" to Canadian customs agents, who have frozen EVERY SINGLE
FREAKIN COPY of PoP destined for my area. >:(

Wal Mart, EB, Future Shop, tried em all, Toys R Us hadn't even heard
of it when I phoned them yesterday to see about it being in, so...
bleah.  At least a 2 day wait, apparently, "probably more like a week
or more."

Death.  Death to those who guard our borders from the heinous evil of
new expansions.
