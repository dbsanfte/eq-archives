It's neither, and you really should be able to grasp this concept. Collision
detection is computationally expensive. In any computer game 99% of the CPU
workload is spent doing one of 3 things: Rendering (thats 'drawing the
graphics' in layman's terms), AI and Collision. EQs servers don't render
though, they spend their time on AI, collision, database management and
broadcasting text. If every single object had to avoid every other in EQ the
servers would simply be unable to cope. This has _nothing_ to do with design
or competence it is a simple fact.
You'd be surprised how many standalone games cut the same corners - go look
at Tomb Raider and see how the monsters _completely ignore_ scenery objects
during fights. Go look at some papers on decent route-finding algorithms -
anything beyond the most basic of methods and you are looking at _serious_
computational expense.
Find something else to complain about.
