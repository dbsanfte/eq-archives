Well, no... Just last night, me and some friends were in Skyfire,
and the tank jokingly complained that I was wasting mana by CH'ing
too soon. So I decided I'd try to time it as close as possible, and
waited as long as I dared. The heal hit when he was at two bubbles...
of purple...

Needless to say, he didn't complain about my wasting mana again =D
And that was against an unslowed wyvern, too...

Rune, who realizes that he was stupid lucky on that one.
