    Inte's Sword of Death, 100/10. The first pic of it being used was of
Kreugen (Fires of Heaven) beating the unholy snot out of Furor (uberwarrior
guildleader, FoH) with it. And (correct me if I'm wrong) doesn't Inte still
have it? It was flagged No Rent and No Drop after the whole "look what WE
got!" debacle.
