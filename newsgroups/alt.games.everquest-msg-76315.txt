Ok, that's not quite how I read that.

Aren't adds part of fighting?  If you pick a fight in a wide open area,
don't you need to ask yourself if you can handle any adds that come along?
The point is, while there are some who rely on the kindness of others, most
just make bad choices, or have a bad run of luck.  Only once did I meet
someone who insisted on fighting where he obviously didn't belong.  He was a
Warrior fighting in Unrest, who couldn't take on a Death Beatle.

Some vary on this.  It seems most are more willing to put effort into
getting group member than they are in helping departing members.

When, above, you talk about letting people learn their limits the hard way,
it seems that you think that it's your job to teach them by not allowing
them to recover from their mistakes.  I consider that condescending.

That's cool.  We both come to the same conclusion, I think I'm just a bit
more generous in my view of other players.  Maybe I haven't been burned as
much.  Of course, I think my Paladin gets asked for SoW just as much as a
Druid.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
