First you complain about him using a term you find offensive, then you turn
around and call someone who gives a concrete example of a problem 'a huge
loot bitch'?  Say goodbye to your credibility, you just tossed it out the
window.

And as for who was the arbiter of the rules - how about the combined
officers of two guilds sitting down and working it out, as happened in my
example?

The problem with NBG occurrs when everyone doesn't agree on a standard.  If
the standard of what constitutes Need is agreed upon before hand, and people
stick with that standard, the problems are greatly reduced.
