That's good, because that's what we're doing :)

Noted, and appreciated.

A right? No more so than the right I already have to express my
opinion. Someone's name choice doesn't prove they're an idiot - but
for my money it can be a pretty good indicator if they're the kind of
person I care to associate with or not.

If someone is being disruptive in-game, calling others names or being
otherwise rude at the expense of someone else's enjoyment of the game,
then by all means the affected party should feel free to petition
them. As for what punishment to apply, if any, that's up to the GMs.

>The NG should abide by the same rules as the game

Not at all! This newsgroup isn't a product of Verant, and isn't
subject to any rules apart from those we impose upon ourselves and
those required by our individual ISPs - nor should it ever be!
