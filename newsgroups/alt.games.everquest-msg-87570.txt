LOL! Sounds like the patch team was up a little too late.

OMFG! Thank you! Now I don't have to yell at all the pet owners
to park their pets all the time. Now maybe I will actually summon my
enchanter's pet once in a while. LOL!

I like it. Now when I am waiting for a spawn 20 casters won't gate in at
exactly t-minus 20 seconds to the exact spawn time. =)

Wow very nice changes. Why is Verant going soft all of a sudden?
Somebody drop the only copy 'the Vision' into a paper shredder?

Good. I was getting thirsty selling to all the multitudes of people there auctioning.
Er wait...

Good nothing like making it easy to power level up smithing. God forbid smiths
should have to go out and hunt their components down like tailors. Now how
about some pelt and silk vendors for tailoring? =)

Good. About time. Now the exploiters will have to find something else
to pull with and I can use the spell for scouting. =)

Faction? From animals? Hmmm ok

Yikes. Depends on your definition of entertaining I guess.

I bet that was a fun surprise to the first warrior to try that in a crowded
multi-level dungeon LOL.
