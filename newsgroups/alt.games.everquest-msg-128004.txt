 I zoned from EW to Iceclad once and crashed. Tried to log back in and was 
repeatedly dumped back to sever select. Eventually I tried logging onto that
character with my 2nd computer and it worked fine. Ok.. problem isolated to
the other computer. Got on chat many times, Tech-GM guy could not help or 
make any suggestions. Eventually scoured the EQ-Live site help thingie and 
found the answer. All I had to do to fix the problem was to simply move, 
rename or delete the *.ini and *.opt files for that character and log in. 
Poof! I could now log onto my character in Iceclad on the prefered computer.
 
 BUT, I didn't have any hot buttons and all my options were default. 
Fortunately I had backed up all the *.ini and *.opt files for my characters
a few weeks before that and copied them over for that character. Poof! Got
most of my hot buttons back (I had changed a few since the back up).
 
 Apparently *.ini and *.opt files (either one or both, not sure which) get
corrupted somehow occasionally which makes you get dumped back to either 
the server select screen OR the desktop when trying to log onto a character. 
Deleting the files makes EQ create a new set of default files when you start
up or log on allowing you to log on normally. 
 
 All I can say is if you like your set of hot buttons and options as they are
now and you don't relish the idea of creating 100 new buttons to replace what
you had, back up those files occasionally. Do it now!
