Ah, well, that would explain it, those little details are easy to gloss over
when the character you are playing most of the time isn't interested;
due to a need for a solo character I've recently been playing my necro,

As long as the bonus was there at some point, I'd be perfectly willing
to believe it got nerfed without me noticing.
