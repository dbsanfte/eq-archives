/agree after trying for a port out of odus for a week straight, I
finally begged a guildie to port my alt out.  I don't like bothering
people who are playing for their own enjoyment.  Guildies are not taxi's
in my opinion, only time i would somewhat support taxi service is in
trying to get everyone to a zone for a raid set up, ie collecting people
from around the world and dumping them in WC or something so groups can
get formed and then port to the raid area.
