Microsoft dos was a workable operating system . It was severely flawed in
memory allocation in its later years but we forgive Bill for that lack of
vision, it really wasnt his fault . Windows was a kludge overlay on dos an
already defunct system due to memory allocation problems . We wont forgive
him for windows . Any other operating system is better . I dont blame Bill
for the prevalence of windows . I blame all the people who couldnt use
anything else .

You also cant be all that savvy a programmer or you would have laughed at my
american++ joke :p I will admit that libertarian c programmers are rare but
you claim to be both .
