I visited Ice clad with my shaman for the first time last night, thinking I
would try my hand at the cougars.  First thing I noticed is that the range
of my spells seems to be significantly reduced, I need to be practically on
top of a cougar to cast a spell on it.  Second thing I noticed is that even
though the one I attacked conned blue, as soon as root broke, while it was
still above half health, it went pouncing off away from me, only to come
running back, smack me a couple times, then go running off again, causing
all it's friends to join in.  I did try to root it again when the root
broke, but it was already out of range.  The good thing I found is that by
running off a ways, it was easy to get them to lose interest in me.  I
promptly gated back to Frontier Mountain to continue getting xp there.
Perhaps someone here could offer some good pointers on fighting the cougars
in Iceclad.
