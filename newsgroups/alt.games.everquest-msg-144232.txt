You die to the Elysians? Did you get trained a lot?

Because I have killed probably 120 of those things
and I only died once to a Dark Assassin that was trained on me and
backstabbed me when I was low on health, (heh 585 backstab wish I could
charm that fucker)

Elysians are easy once you land snare. They just take a long
time.
