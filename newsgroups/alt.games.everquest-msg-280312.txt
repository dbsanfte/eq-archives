You're right, that is missing from the text, and I thank you for pointing it out.

DRUs, ENCs and MAGs have limited use for Deepwater Knights faction.  They're mostly in the
game for newbie quests, and the Paladin Epic 1.0 .

OTOH, "to save some of us the trouble of trying to find out" ?  *How* lazy?

Quests involving Deepwater Knights faction:
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qsearch.html?faction=13

You could also Google the phrase "good deepwater knights faction", with the quotes.
There's 1 good hit.  Now try "deepwater knights faction" - 8 hits.  Now try "deepwater
knights" good faction and bingo! 14 useful hits.

Best regards,
