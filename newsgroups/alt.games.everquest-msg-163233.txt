...It is level 55, like all the other spirits, but this one is a bit
trickier to kill. Since it it underwater, you will want the tanks to have EB
on. All the resists are high, so do not try to nuke until it has been
debuffed or if you are a wizard then you can use your lure spells. Your
spells will only work if the monster is out of the water, which can be
tricky to do, since it summons. Another twist with this mob is that it has a
10-15 second ae stun. Again, just get MR high enough, and it won't hit you.
