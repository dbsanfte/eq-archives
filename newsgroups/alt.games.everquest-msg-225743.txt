That is a hard one, I also have a group of RL friend so we try to get
together alot. From what I can see from your groups is that the best level
for everyone tp be together is the 40 ish group.

acct1:  37 wiz - DPS
acct3:  37 clr - heals, rezzes
acct4:  45 bst - only class available for this level range on this account
acct5:  40 pal - tankage
acct6:  37 warr - meat shield (note; if your pally is uber - twinked - I
would use the monk here for pulls)
acct7:  40 shm - slows, buffs / back up heals for unreliable acct3

For higher levels accts 5 & 6 are kinda left out

acct1: 52 war - meat shield
acct2: 57 shm - buffs ,slows
acct3: 56 mag (gotta love a mage :)
acct4: 58 clr (definately use bard if shmy is happy healing and has the mana
pool)
acct7: 55 shd snare, tankage
acct8: 54 enc mind buffs (2 box)

MY favourite combo is:

cleric (me)
mage or necro - extra mana there if needed
shammy - slows, haste
bard - mana regen, crowd control
SK - as long as they can keep agro and have good hp/mana
free spot - ranger shooting or rogue backstabbing or warroir for extra
tankage
