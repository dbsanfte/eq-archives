I have a Golden Bracer, which has Extended Range II as a focus effect (if
I'm remembering right).

Last night, I cast Levitate on myself, and got a message that my Golden
Bracer glowed as my vision cleared, and the "You cast levitate" message.
The Levitate finished, but I did not start levitating.

I cast Levitate again, and this time did not get any message from the GB,
and Levitate worked like normal.

Anyone have any idea what my GB was up to that first time?
