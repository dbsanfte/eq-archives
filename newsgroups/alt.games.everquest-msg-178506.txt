Im still pressing "A", and clicking Hide to evade.... as you can probably
tell, I tank more often then not, so dont need to lose agro much

I do need to make proper hotkeys now hes getting to mid levels tho... do you
need pauses for multi-skills?

And what all do/can you combine?

Woah how old was the site i read...  got a link to an uptodate epic
walkthrough?  I plan on doing it soon..

If I can't kill for it.. do I need a high PP skill to get it?  Is it slow to
raise?   If so.. MQable?  Yes, im very lazy!

Just a lot of frustration overall I guess... i still make all the raids
(ssra, vt, aow, HoH, tactics)

But when you miss one you get further and further behind.. I missed PonB..
now ive missed TT and Sarryn... i have 2 of the hoh trials, missed the
dragon kills, so MM too..

The monk has 176 AA's.. sure theres more stuff I can get, but the reward now
is so limited.. when i log on my rogue nobody knows me, i exp in
new/different places...

I can tell beggars to fuck off, without fear it reflects on my guild (note..
when i buff you out the goodness of my heart, with spells that cost over
1000 mana each, DONT FUCKING PESTER ME THE WHOLE DAY FOR MORE)

I was already level 60 when Luclin came out, I missed all the noob zones.. I
got PoV/PoS flagged on my first day of PoP, I missed all the tier 1 places
etc

I was too high for JP when it got revamped, and wherever else..

Basically I missed out on being a "noob".. and im re-living that now

Also, Shroud will make a huge difference when I go to a new place to pull..
I was the first monk to learn VT in my guild, I had no info, no maps,
nothing.

The guild had zero knowledge.. rogues scouted ahead and tried to describe
stuff for me.. I used Zomm, and ultimately, learnt the HARD way (hi death)..
with my own rogue, its much easier in the future.

I also had serious bad luck with FD in that fucking zone.. theres a running
joke amongst my guildie monks when I pull VT.. "martin has fallen to the
ground.. again.. and is now being brutalised.."
I can go a week with no FD fails..  1 day of VT and I can have 5-10 fails.
(Im under 10 deaths period in VT tho, seen monks die that much in 1
clearing, so its not THAT bad)

One thing Ive noticed, the further in the game I've progressed, the less
information and more secretive people become..

My guildie did a brilliant pulling guide for a mob on monkly-bus, map and
all..  nobody does that for VT, Zek, SoRo etc :p

So i was aiming for level 63 by the end of Feb.. of course now my 3 main
friends in the game have taken up twinks too, and if I don't moderate my
rogue game play, I'll leave them behind.
Im 42 (maybe dinged 43, I forget.. was close tho).. necro is 39, rogue is 32
and ranger 30)

Also raiding still takes up a shitload of time.. hes 1 or 2 weeks old now,
and still not over "1day x hours" /played
