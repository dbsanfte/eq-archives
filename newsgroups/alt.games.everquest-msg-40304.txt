Aint that the truth. I died in Kithicor at around lvl 13 after some ranger and
his fat bear took a dislike to my harmless necromncer ways. He slew me and the
pet with outrageous ease and i had no idea what kithicor was at night, one of
my guilies asked me what i was up to and i said im on a CR to kith and he kinda
just laughed saying to wait till dawn, thats good advice.
Kithicor is a werid zone, it borders to w.commons but its a frightening place
and i've read on here a fair few higher level players still get nervous in
there. Try to get some invis or something and maybe sow and loot your corpse
then just run like stink for the zone, good luck.
