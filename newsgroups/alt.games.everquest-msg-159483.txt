/cry, payed 20K for mine, since i from the start suspected an upcoming 
nerf, that would make 20K for it cheap. I were stupid enough to think 
that VI would do like they have done to all other tradeskills, and nerf 
the DROP RATE of the stuff needed to make it.
But nooo, we nerf the item instead, and since the Embalmers skinning 
knife are useable by all non-heal classes but monks i would guess that 
we monks got the shaft again.

Luckily i got money/space to get a collapsible toolkit and some mana 
batteries, but i feel sorry for the monks who blew their life savings on 
this. Lets all go thanks VI for this nice change.
Oh, and also thanks for mine now saying "unknown spell", so it cant even 
summon bandages any more.

Oh well, at least i can leave my monk and all her nerfs and get back to 
my druid and XP some...oh wait, they nerfed harmony too, so i cant kill 
my favorite mobs, othmirs, any more, AND while doing that severely 
limiting my tailoring skillup rate.


Guess ill go play my warrior before they go nerf him to only being able 
to wear silk armor, and changing all my procs (including the embalmers 
skinning knife) to "summon water" instead.
