Yep. It's a "you can't do that" type of question.  Well, not that you _can't_
do it, but it's not going to be easy and you probably don't want to try it at
level 2 or 3.  You'll be KOS all over Antonica to begin with. (Anyway, I
*believe* that's true. Never actually played an Ikkie, so I'm not positive, but
I recall reading that.)
  Ton of faction work to be able to get into Grobb or Neriak. Better hope your
friends are close by and always on line to help you with shopping, etc.  And
all the guards who protect them will be trying to squash you. Ouch.
  If you really want to start an evil shaman to meet up with your buddies, why
not go with an Ogre? Then you can *very* quickly hook up with your Troll buddy
two zones away, and you'll be welcome in Grobb. (Well, perhaps not *welcome*,
but not KOS anyway.)
