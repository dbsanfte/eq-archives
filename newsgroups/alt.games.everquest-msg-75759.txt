Yep. I have it on both my machines. One is a AMD 800 Mhz, 640 Mb, Geforce 2,
Windows XP machine, and the other is my laptop, a P3-650, 128 Mb,
ATIMobility Video. Both machines have the SAME problem, and that makes me
think its an EQ problem.... Of course the laptop is loading slower in
general, but before the Luclin patch i never had these problems.

I don't have Shadows of Luclin yet, but I plan to buy it one of these days.
At least on the Geforce 2 Machine i can use it with all the detailed
characters on and such.

This problem is something EQ should fix. Its weird because I seem to move
trought the masses on the marketplace in NFP without any problem, and on the
empty streets of Quenos its hard to turn around the corner.
