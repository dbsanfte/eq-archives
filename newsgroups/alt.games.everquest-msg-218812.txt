Because cleric spells, by and large, do not have to pass a resist
check. A 52 wizard isn't going to land many spells on a 61 MOb and a
52 warrior is going to be about as effective a tank against them as
the wizard would. The cleric's heals are still going to land. Should
rezzes be needed, they will always land.

It makes a huge difference. I can't see a 65 group with a 52 warrior
as their only tank finishing a LDoN adventure unless they're
effectively PLing him. The same goes for a 65 group with a 52 wizard.
A 52 cleric, otoh, can be main healer in a group like that and still
have a reasonable expectation of a win.
