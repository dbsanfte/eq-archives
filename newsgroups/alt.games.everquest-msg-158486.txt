Tiru's line up:
CHeal
Remedy (the light heal for speed and int casters)
Celestial Healing or Divine Light (depends on which is better in the
situation)
(slot changes for the buff at the moment- I swap this a lot.)
Rez. (sometimes is Group Heal, or other buff slot, and on a riad, it's a
stun or group heal)
Stun or nuke
Root, nuke or stun
Gate

I may be the only cleric I know who has never used Divine Aura.
