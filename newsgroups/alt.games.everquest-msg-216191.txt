Correction, I always know which mobs *might* aggro and plan accordingly.  As
for not knowing where it will path or if it will have some
previously-unknown ability, maybe on my first time through I might be a bit
more cautious because of this, but see, I don't actually have a problem
remembering what I learned on my first trip and applying it to all
consecutive trips.  Only an idiot pulls the 5,000th frog in Lower Guk and is
amazed that they get ghoul-rooted.  :P

No, it's *your* fault cause you can't remember how the same mob in the same
spot in the same dungeon will act from one trip to the next.  :P  I don't
suffer from such memory loss.

Yes indeed.  That's me.  Pulling my guild from Vindi to the elementals, and
giving monks a bad name the whole way.  :)

Nope, but I do know that he will gain mana back at a fixed rate and be
perfectly able to cover for a fizzle.  I don't plan on people being stupid,
but I always figure in average fizzle rates, etc., when pulling.  I don't
wipe my group.  And from the original post, neither did that guy.  :P

As an interesting aside, I did two adventures tonight with me 2-boxing the
cleric.  No enchanter.  No bard.  I was the best choice for tank, ranger was
the only other option.  All 65s, so the only way we make the dungeon harder
is to set the difficulty higher (and with the choice of a ranger or monk
tank...  yeah).  Ya think I gave myself a break cause I was 2-boxing the
cleric?  Three guesses, first two don't count.  I *know* the mana regen rate
of clerics.  :P

Yeah, cause only slow-minded idiots will enjoy the rapid experience gain
with minimal downtime that my groups consist of.  It's the true geniuses
that prefer to be too cautious and constantly prepare for everyone else in
their group to screw the pooch that must group with you...

For the magician to be "significantly higher in level" to make him the
preferable choice for pulling, he's going to be PL'ing.

And the magician being the only one with sow?  Please, play the game, see
how it works.  There ain't *nobody* that doesn't have sow if they want it
these days.  A little reality, please.

Yeah, and your tortured attempt to prove me wrong with personal attacks
alone has gone a long way to convince me otherwise...
