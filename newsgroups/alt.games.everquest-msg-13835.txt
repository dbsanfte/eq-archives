Let me comment on the reactions here:

My character is lvl 17, so he is not too high for Warrens.
I did every patch, but appeared in the small room after a camp inside
warrnes, so I dont see how it was my own fault.
Of course I realized the GM was doing a bit if role playing, but calling me
a naughty monkey for doing nothing wrong, except falling into a game bug, is
not a good way to excuse or explain a bug. Verant should give a small
compensation for putting ppl in that position. Well, no big deal.
