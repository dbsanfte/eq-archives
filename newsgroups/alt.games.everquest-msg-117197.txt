Probably, yes.  But we're not talking about any game, we're talking about
EQ.  And EQ clearly DOESN'T cause suicidal depression, otherwise every
player would be suicidally depressed.

It's sensible to suggest that EQ - or Shaun's perception of EQ - might have
been an aggravating factor, but as I said, Verant can't be expected to make
allowances for the mental state of everyone who might possibly buy their
game.  EQ obviously doesn't induce depression in itself because I don't
suffer from it and the majority of other players don't suffer from it -
particularly to the point of suicide.  That it may have been a contributory
factor only begs the question as to why those who should have been
responsible for him were letting him play the game to the degree that he got
himself into such a situation.

I suspect this lawsuit is much like the majority of others:  a desperate
attempt to pass the buck and shift responsibility onto someone else while at
the same time making a tidy sum out of a tragedy.
