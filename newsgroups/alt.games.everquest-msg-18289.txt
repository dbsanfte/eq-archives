I play both and your missing the pertinent fact that regular local game
sessions are not possible  for majority of those who  do play EQ.

Since when can you get your group to play reliably and enjoy 100%
attendance?
Besides the fact that EQ is a great vehicle to get other local  friends who
are playing  EQ  to consider the <to them  the new roleplay gaming  of paper
dice and minatures?>

EQ is not superior to  a Good  gaming group  but when you r tired of makeing
stuff and solo gaming Eq is far better.
