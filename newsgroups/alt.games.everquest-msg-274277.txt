It's just a guess, but I'd about bet that the word alone might have only 
garnered a warning, if even that.  Couching it in d00d's probably what 
turned the trick.

I've seen much worse than that, but overall, foul language isn't a big 
problem, at least on the server I use most often.  Of course, the purveyors 
of what little I've seen may have also won a 72-hour vacation.
