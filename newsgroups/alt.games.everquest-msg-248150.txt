Some friends are getting together to hit Fear in a few weeks and we
are all changing characters for a little cross-training and 2-box
skill-ups.

One of the stipulations is to learn about the class and tactics on our
own, no owner input.  After all, if the owner is wrong why perpetuate
the problem...

So I'm looking for community advice on a spell lineup.  Primary tank
is ogre warrior who will end up with about 12k HP's when all is said
and done.  MA is a Paladin followed loosely by Rogue and Mage/Necro
pets.

My job will be the tank (another person will be cleric'ing for the
group).  My guess at this point would be:

Complete Healing
Celestial Healing
Celestial Elixir
Supernal Light
Tarnation
Enforced Reverance
Sound of Force
Sound of Might

In the beginning I would Divine Intervention and Mark of the Righteous
him as well as HP/AC buffs.  I know another cleric who swears by the
chain stun theory, hence why I included so many.

I would like to hear if this lineup is horked, decent, or raid ready.

Thanks.

~F
