Just wondering about all you people complaining about the game suddenly not
working...  I'm assuming you're all sending clearly written, detailed
complaints to Verant's tech support e-mail address, detailing your system
configuration, driver versions and other pertinent information, as well as
MS Windows error codes (if any) whenever these problems occure?

Cuz honestly, if all you're doing is complaining to people on here about
these issue, then how the heck do you expect the programmers to take your
problem into consideration in the next batch of patches?  Is your problem
unique and isolated to your configuration, or is it one shared by hundreds
of other players?  I'm pretty sure that if the people over at Verant heard
about a particular problem from several thousand people, they'd be more
prone to fix it than if a few select whiners kept complaining ineffectively
on a newsgroup...
