After playing Asheron's Call for 2+ years and getting 9 chars to level
126(4,286 million xp), I finally got bored and fed up after the upcoming
life magic nerf and decided to try this game after getting the game and 30
days free in my email. After being hypnotized by the same game for 30 months
I don't know where to even start. Anyone have any suggestions or links?
