What *you* do is fucking irrelevant.

It only requires *one* person to be abusing the system for it all to
fall down.  That is why NBG doesn't work where there is no long term
relationship.  NBG is great in guild and friends groups and damn well
should be what always happens in those situations.  But only a single
player abusing NBG in pick up groups makes the whole system unworkable.

Believe me, I *tried* to make NBG work for a long time when I used to do
pick up groups (long time ago), and a sizeable minority were *spotted*
selling off items they had claimed as NBG soon after they got the drop.
That's *just* those spotted, lots will likely have sold without ever
being seen doing so by those involved in the group (or by simply muling
for the EC sale)..
