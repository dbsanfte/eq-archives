    Allow me to cut and paste from a web board I post to....

    The changes aren't all that big, on the whole. Purify Soul and Divine
Res are still AA's that aren't worth purchasing over, say, resists. The
Unswerving Hammer mana cost change doesn't really help a cleric solo
appreciably faster (3 less ticks of medding per mob), nor does it make the
hammer useful in later levels. I had the opportunity to have ornate greaves,
with right-clickable Hammer, and passed because of how little the hammer
does. Until today, the level 19 Celestial Remedy was slower than the level
14 Healing, had a worse mana ratio, and wasn't helped out by extended
enhancement or improved healing foci. It was near-pointless to use. Now, the
mana ratio is at least close to that of Healing. And the AoZ/BAotR conflict
with Focus is the last of the big "buff stacking" conflicts that has been
addressed, with others (paladin/ranger/beastlord) getting priority.

    The two big changes are DB and Celestial Regen. The Celestial Regen
change is a true upgrade, and for me at least, has changed the AA from
"won't get before resists" to "will get before resists". I think it'll
really help clerics in a CH rotation to keep their group alive against an
AoE without having to leave the rotation.

    The DB change is in response to cleric complaints that DA, a level 1
spell, was vastly superior to DB. SOE hates it when people claim lower-level
spells are better, so they enhanced it. Before, DA was faster and cost less
mana. DB had a fairly useless heal component (one that didn't give enough
HPs to avoid a summons after it wore off and which used to conflict with
regen spells ages ago), it cost more, it was slower to cast (and
slow-casting emergency spells are useless), and it had a damage shield
component that could cause a mob to start summoning. With the enhanced
healing and reduced casting time, I'd now say that DB is a true upgrade to
DA and is the invulnerability spell a cleric should cast first.

    So two upgrades. One is vastly more important to group members than it
is to the cleric, and will likely be part of the melee rebalancing against
AoE mobs. The other is nice, but can be filed under "should have always
worked this way". So other classes really don't have much to be jealous
about. Now if we got something like self-only invisibility, like the folks
at EQClerics want, THEN you can say we're getting special treatment!

    So, yeah. When people say "look at all the attention you got", they
should look at exactly what that attention was. We got a previously
near-useless AA turned into a useful AA, and we got our second-rank
invulnerability spell turned into a first-rank spell. My head is swimming
with the power of it all.

    Your SotW has an AC component, a large damage shield, stacks with
everything (CR does not stack against EE, SE, Torpor/Quiescence). We get the
advantage in duration and points of damage healed. Curious - how much does
SotW cost to take to level 3? CR takes 5 + 3 + (presumably) 3. As for faster
recast, while that might help if you're doing XP someplace where you take a
lot of AE damage from mobs (and I can't think of many places like that), on
raids the really useful use of the abilities is limited by the cycle time on
MGB, which is identical for both classes. You got SotW because it's an
incredible AA, and it still is no matter what someone else has. Don't lose
sight of that.
