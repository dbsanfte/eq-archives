People here have said good, things, but, things which need emphasising:

Resists & Bards

Dragons have AEs, & Fears, so the people you want to DEFINITELY stay around
during the fight, need to be able to resist these as best they can, so, MT,
Main Cleric need whacho resists.

Jewellery, resist buffs, & a bard is the way to go, so you have to have a
bard in the main group, and keep close the MT and Cleric.

The more bards the better, and, if you have a bard in your group, stay close
to him/her.


Clerics / Healing

MT group need a good cleric, and good buffs.  Other groups clerics aren't so
important, so druids / shammies can substitute for clerics.  PoTG is good
for caster groups and what have you, saves a lot of time on the Aegoings.

As someone else said, you dont really want your epic quipped lvl 60 cleric
camped out, so, get them bound close by, or else ask if they'll be happy to
suck up a 39/49 rez, and get one of those clerics camped out before u start,
if u can afford that.


i'd go something like:

MT Group: Cleric, Bard, 4 x Tanks (MT and Secondary, make sure people know
in advance!)
Assist Group: Cleric, Bard, Melee Damage Dealers.

Have MT call when the others should come to assist (pretty early on
usually!)  All those who can, should use anti-agro as much as possible
(evade, jolt, etc) to keep Agro on main tank.

DD groups : whatever you have available, shouldn't really start nuking
before mob is down to 60% or 70% else they'll risk gettign agro, good
casters know how to control their agro.  Druids can do the healing in these
groups, else get the clerics to load up fast heals, and group heals.

Magicians : Mod rods, they may well be useful
Necros : spike clerics with mana if needed.
Pets : generally v little poitn


adieu!
