i always think of the delay as whole seconds, even though they're not.  so i
multiply the damage by 2, then divide by the delay to get my damage per
second.  even though this may not be your actual DPS, it does tell you when
a new weapon will do more damage than an old one.  my general rule is that
if the damage 2x is meets or exceeds the delay, i've got a good weapon.
that way i can skip the division part.  also, i sometimes pick a weapon that
looks cool =)
