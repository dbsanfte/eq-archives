Yes, damn right.

Hey, what the fuck is wrong with having *one* camp you can use to farm
Spectral Parchments without at least a 4 hours session?  Seriously?  Its
level 63 and 64 spells - you can't imp a caster by levels (especially
now the resist scheme works on numbers and not levels) spells are their
only way forward, they don't get an extra 1 on their modal damage bonus
just by hitting L61.

If Verant wanted to they could easily reset flags if they considered the
encounter too difficult.  Nerfing it so that mainstream players cannot
emulate what the first there did is not a solution that should be used.
They *were* willing to do it once (with Seru drops) so they can quite
happily do it again.

There are ways that a company with *any* focus on quality control can
manage these systems.  Ways that should not even incurr ridiculous
expense but it requires a little bit of foresight and maybe even some
common sense.
