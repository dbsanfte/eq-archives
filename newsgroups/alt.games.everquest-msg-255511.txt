Oh but it would help immensely. SOE would be able to design single group 
content without having to contend with two radically different groups of 
endgame players. We wouldn't be facing one group content that you needed 
raid equipment to deal with... and conversely, you wouldn't be facing 
one group content you could cream thanks to your raid gear. Its really a 
win-win situation for the game, I think.

The non-raiders who have put in the same amount of time and effort as 
the raiders would have gear that would be equivalent -in one group 
content-.

A large portion of the playerbase is always pissed off no matter what 
they do, or even if they do nothing at all. Currently I'm pissed off; 
you might as well take your turn.

> Fucking whiny soloer.

Looks like I can make the raiders squeal like babies without even the 
/feedback. :p

Oh and I'm not a soloer, though I sympathize with them. I'm a dedicated 
grouper myself, but that really doesn't put me much futher ahead gear-
wise... I'm still stone-walled by raid-only content. You'd be surprised 
at how few raids, even pickup raids, are run at 3am... (on nights they 
aren't patching of course)
