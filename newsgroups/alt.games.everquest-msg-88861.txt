Id like my cleric to PL my wifes 14 dwarven Warrior.
I tried to do this in NRO, but the traffic there was way too heavy....
traffic of Passers by wanting to join in on the PL... I dont want to
PL a Group.. I want to PL her and at most one other of our friends.

Any recommendations on what zone to do this in?

I was looking at runnyeye as a possiblity.... Not very traveled, and
EQatlas lists it as a zone starting at level 10.. up to the 40s...
any input on this.

your time and input are appreciated, as usual..
