I had that happen to me. My nephew called me and told me that a level one
ranger with the name of my level 60 cleric was logged on. It happened right
after I moved the char to another one of my accounts on the same server so I
thought that was how the bug allowed it to happen. I immediately petitioned
and a GM took care of it when they logged on.
