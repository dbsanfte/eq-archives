Oh yes it's worth it.  Mana-free haste is so very nice.

It can take a longish time to complete, so start now, and by the time you
need some of the difficult bits, you'll be ready for them.  I think it took
me a bit over a year, but I had the birth of my daughter and the breakup of
two guilds in there somewhere.

Speaking of guilds.  There are some parts that you can do by yourself, but
there are others that will require guild help.

The most difficult parts are going to be getting the Essence of a Vampire
from Hate, and the Head of a Serpent from Fear.  Those two were what I
stalled on for that year.  There are others that can be difficult to
arrange, but if you do, you can be assured of getting the piece you need
(Chardok royals, for instance).

Good luck!
