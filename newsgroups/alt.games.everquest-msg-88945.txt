I feel like a doofus, continuing to post about the same topic repeatedly...

Turns out one of my friends only has enough spare time to play one
character, and his 27 wizard is more worth his time.  So now I'm down to me
and two others for our group.  Figuring for a bard and a tank (undecided
what exactly, either monk or warrior), what one other class would be the
most useful?  I'm thinking druid has the widest range of abilities that
would be of use for a 3-person team...
