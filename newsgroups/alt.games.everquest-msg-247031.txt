Except for the fact that *no one* ever refers to their character as a 
"cartoon". Therefore, "toon" isn't just a shortening of normal terminology. 
I consider it d00d-speak, myself.

I have the same problem with the terms "wizzy", "shammy", "pally" and the 
like. Much like "toon", those examples don't serve any purpose aside from 
being an attempt at sounding more hip. At least "pally" knocks a syllable 
off of the pronunciation. The others are just unnecessary mutations.

IMO, of course.
