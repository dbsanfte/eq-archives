Fortunately, my experience is that 70%+ of the paludal crowd stays
within easy training distance of SH or SWT and 25%+ go to Bandit 2.
The ZEP is just so high that it makes no sense to go anywhere else to
PL 10 to 25 or so.

Having PLed 3 characters through those levels in Paludal, I don't
think I've ever stepped on anybody's toes. Usually, I go up to the
Reishicyban room and work my way south from there.
