  Some people have reported getting good performance out of the Kryo
II in EQ, but I'd still gravitate towards a 64 mb MX400 since it's
about the same price.  The Kryo II has no T&L and instead features an
advanced form of what is called "tile based rendering"... I don't
understand all the technical details of it, but the principle behind
the technology is that it's smarter than other cards about figuring
out what it needs to render (only what is visible) and what it
doesn't.  Other cards feature similar technologies (including the
GeForce2, I believe) but the Kryo II is more advanced than the others
in this area.  However, the Kryo II is lacking the "brute power" of
its competitors.
