I think you mean checks and balances, right?

Supposedly? Does this mean you are talking out of your ass?

Bullshit meter officially pegged in the red.

The original DMCA is already so fraught with abuse it is ridiculous, and it 
is currently being used for a large variety of uses it was not intended 
for. Does it go to the Supreme Court? Nope. Why? Because the MPAA has all 
the money, time, and lawyers in the world.

Bills like this *must* be stopped at the House. To think it is OK to allow 
a law to be passed because "Aw shucks we can just change it whenever it 
gets used" is naive, inefficient, and downright laughable.
