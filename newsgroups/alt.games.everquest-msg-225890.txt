Go straight when you enter the zone, at the edge of the graveyard with 
the clip plane up, you'll see a stretch of sewer water.  Across the 
water and a bit left you'll see some land with a big rock.  Nothing 
moves across there unless its brought there, with the exception of a 
high level non aggro ogre (quest mob).  This, then, is the ideal kiting 
area.  Further around the lake towards the direction you are facing 
(clockwise, that is), though, the land goes over a little hillock and 
into the lowest level flies.  Continue across left to right and you get 
two more batches, or continue further forward across the "water" some 
more and you get higher level flies.  Mixed in are some rats and larvae, 
which wander in and out, and can add.  As a bard, you won't care so 
much, but you need to be aware that some may be uncharmable by your 
song, and that they are much tougher than the flies; if you Can charm 
one do so early, if you can't, pick him as target for pet after pet, 
they'll wear down fast, which is what you want anyway, and they will 
gradually tear him down too, so you can eventually kill him with chants.
