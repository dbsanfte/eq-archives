Easily doable if you just concentrate on grinding xp to level in that
amount of time. You're talking about averaging thirty hours a week plus
another 30+ on the weekend. Straight grinding in the forties you should
easily be able to grind out a yellow of xp every couple of hours. Either
in full groups, or if you can hook up in a duo with a healer, either
cleric, druid, shammy, you can fight pretty much non-stop. Solo you'll
have some down time depending on your gear.

If you can hook up with a duo, I'd suggest going to the City of Mist and
fighting the entry mobs in the first courtyard area. Plenty of mobs, the
place is often empty, and the ZEM is good. If you can get in a full
group and get the entry of the Hole (yes, you're a bit low level for it
right now, but in a full group you'd manage) the ZEM is insane and the
forties will fly by.
