Um, well, the first thing that comes to mind, is it's a joke as a hell
level?  OK, it's probably hard for me to have much sympathy, having recently
dinged 54, and knowing that I still have 59 to go through.  I did start a
cleric who is lvl 9 after much hard work, and has not quite dinged 10, but,
well, having to kill 30 mobs to make it all the way through 10 still seems,
well, for lack of a better word, trivial.

Seriously though, if a person finds that the speed of levelling through 10
is that disheartening, then I really do believe that everquest is not the
game for them.
