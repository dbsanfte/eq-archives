What's REALLY fun is to make the emote non-specific, and
do it in a crowd of folks.

/em has picked YOUR pocket for 7 gold piece, and YOU
notice!!!

Having 4 newbies yelling at you in the N. FP bank, at which
point you say you'll give 'em their money back but you have
to get it out of the vault, then proceding to trap all 4 of them
in the vault at the same time while you "hide" away can
really liven up your day.

It USUALLY livens up theirs, too, when you clue 'em into
the real facts and let 'em go and give 'em 250 pp for
unwilling participation in a "make the rogue laugh" contest...
