True, but the point is, it was only marginally a pickup group.  Four 
guildies, who traditionally based the system not around 'it's an upgrade' 
but around 'class that can use', and one other person.

I'm fairly certain that nobody in that group would have found ornate of 
any kind to be an upgrade.  But just in case, our system pretty much 
covered that (in our opinion) with almost nobody ever having to roll or 
think twice.  But since we'd added -one- non-guildie, suddenly 
everything's an issue.  And I found his definition of 'NBG' to be quite 
amusing. :)

I guess the real point is, it makes one think twice about whether it's 
worth the effort to invite someone you don't know to a group, higher 
group exp bonus or no.
