Man, this actually makes me a little annoyed now.  I was playing my warrior
when I clicked on "resist" ( macro I made for /disc resist ) only to realize
it didnt work. Clicked it again. Didn't work. Whats this?! V decided to not
allow warriors to use /disc unless we have the SoV expansion?! GAH! What if
my machine can't run SoV?! Hmmm??! Havent had the exp and been able to use
/disc, but after this patch..... BAH! Stupid V. I hate 'em!
