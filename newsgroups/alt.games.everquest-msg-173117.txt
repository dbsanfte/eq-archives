Ghiosk and BRs were pretty much trivial to us on Sunday.  Is Neh andy 
harder?  I'm under the impression that she procs Blind and is harder to 
deal with because of being off the ground, so she needs to be backed into a 
corner.  Are her HPs much more than Ghiosk?

She seemed to have some nice loot - I think we'd like to go for her next 
time we head in there.
