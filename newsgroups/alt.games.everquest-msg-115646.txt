Eh.  You've played to 30, so you know how to be a warrior on a high end raid?

Being a melee at a raid is easy.  Anyone can do it.   Being a good melee is a
whole 'nother issue.  Same as with any other class.   I've played my friend's
level 54 druid when another evacer was needed for fear breaks.   Simple as can
be.   If you think it's that easy, you're most likely not doing it right. ; )
