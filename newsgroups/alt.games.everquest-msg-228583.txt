Pet canni is gone on test and will be on Thu. on live.

Shaman are now the premier mana regen class, followed by necros then
wizards.

Shaman - Cann5 + Quiescence.  VoQ+BoT9+SD+Rods all stack on top.
Necros - Seduction of Sarym+BoT9+SD+Rods
Wizards - Familiar+Force Shield+VoQ+BoT9+SD+Rods+Harvest+HoD

Followed by everyone else that can have VoQ+BoT9+SD+RoDs

Followed by Bards.

is there anything I'm missing?  A class that has some self only
mana regen that stacks with VoQ/BoT9/SD/Rods?
