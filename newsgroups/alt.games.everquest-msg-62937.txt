Ummm, are you aware that these modems have NOTHING to do with your
games.  You can make these modems work with just about ANY OS you can
load on your computer, in fact these modems are very very similar to
the external sportsters, which work just fine without even being
CONNECTED to a computer.

How can you sleep with the black helicopters making all that noise?
Do you have any idea what the average throughput is on an EQ session,
I'll give you a hint, it's a lot less than 3kBytes/second, which is
what a decent 28.8kbit/second connection gives you.  
I'm going to cut you some slack, since you are obviously mentally
challanged, but how can even a complete and utter moron think that EQ
can affect your modem connections, when EQ isn't even running.  Now
anyone with the most rudimentary knowledge of communications and
networking (and since you specify that these are hardware modems, not
winmodems, you probably qualify) knows that a modem connection is most
likely to have trouble because of issues with the phone line.  Why
don't you fire up hyperterminal, which gives you direct access to the
modem, and manually connect?  You will see that you are connecting at
the exact same speed as you are through dial-up networking, and you
will know that the only commands the modem processed are the ones you
gave it.
