Veggies are good to sell in WFP, one of the common places to brew. Also good in
NFP, where people go to buy/sell. I sold veggies for 5pp a stack to desperate
brewers/bakers

For Evergreen leaves its a lot harder. Only used to make green dyes Fine Plate
armor, so NOT a big market for it. Usally sell for around 1pp each.

For Morning Dew and Oak bark, sell to me if your on Veeshan  ;-)
. I usually pay 1pp pr morning dew, 3pp pr oak bark, 4pp pr oak bark tanning
(rewarding people who actually spend time learning brewing, although i can brew
myself).

Note these are Veeshan prices, they might vary on other servers.
