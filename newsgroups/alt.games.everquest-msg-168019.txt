Heh, I've learned to expect crap from people. It's much harder to be
surprised by what someone does when you never put anything above them. In
other words, they were probably going to give you 20 pp anyhow - they just
wanted to make it sound like it was your fault they became jackasses.

As for them refusing the port... well, that's not really your problem. They
most likely weren't going to pay or didn't even have money on them.

Make them pay half now, half when you get there. Then at least you get a
little money if they screw you over.
