I grouped with someone a few nights ago who got killed and blamed me (the
druid) for not healing her.  First of all I was medding at the time and by
the time I realized what was going on I stood up and tried to cast only to
get message that target was out of range.  He was far off and by the time I
got to him he was dead and I was barely able to save another in the group.
He kept sending me tells telling me that I need to watch everybody's life
bar.  Well he needs to not pull when I'm medding and at low mana, not pull
when the rest of the group has 50% HP, not run off far from the healer so
they can't find you in time.
