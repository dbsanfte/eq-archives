Most people here have done a pretty good job explaining kiting except
that they didn't really define the term, they just limited it to
situations where certain classes use it to kill things.  Kiting just
means making the mob run or walk around, unable to get close enough to
any player to attack it.  Imagine the mob is a kite on a string being
held by the person kiting it.  Skillfull weilding of the string will
keep the mob from damaging anyway.

What some people call aggro kiting is where you make the mob chase
you.  In order to do this you have to piss it off enough (gain enough
aggro) that it won't chase others.  The other type of kiting is fear
kiting, where you make the mob run away from you.  All of the other
terms you see in front of kiting just indicate how a player is killing
the mob *while* kiting it.  Arrow kiting, for example, means kiting
one of the two above ways and shooting at it.  Swarm kiting is a way
bards kill *lots* of beasties all at once.  But remember that kiting
doesn't necessarily mean you are killing anything.  It can be a form
of crowd control as well.  Your party can only deal with one mob at a
time, so you get aggro on the add and run it around.  Or some people
have been known to kite a mob just to move it.  A rare monster pops,
you don't want anyone else to kill it before your buddies get there to
help, so you run it well away from his normal spawn point and then run
around in circles.  (Whether you think that is unscrupulous is another
discussion).
