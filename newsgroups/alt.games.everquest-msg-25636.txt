Unfortuneately This is one of the reasons the Enchanter is one of the
toughest classes to play. Wolf Form will work to get you your spells. You
can also try to use this bug I have used it in the past cast minor illusion
then without removeing the illusion cast tree form. This is a bug you will
be in tree form and able to move, you will be able to deal with the vendors.
Just to be on the safe side target and con a guard before entering.
