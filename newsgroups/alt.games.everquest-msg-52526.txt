Well, I think alot of the Asian playerbase would give AB a shot... I was
thinking the best for verant to do would be to make AB a n00b server and
then make another UK split server, and if there is a high amount of people
on (we would never know ourselves how much, damn you verant!) then just
simply make another UK server... dont sound too hard to do. Might cost more
but hey - pleasing some of the playerbase is always good, esp after pissin
them off
