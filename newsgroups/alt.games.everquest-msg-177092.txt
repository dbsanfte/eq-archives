I've been trying to get this down for several levels off and on. As I
understand it, you round up a group of mobs and start running around
them to get them bunched. Charm one and have it start beating on the
others, who gang up on him and beat him down pretty quickly. When your
pet is near death, break charm and chant him the rest of the way down.

A few questions:

1. Once you have charmed one, do you actually have to target another
to sic him on it, or will the others automatically jump on him?

2. I typically use the ADWS keys in conjunction with my mouse for
movement. Is it pretty much a necessity to use the ADWS keys
exclusively for movement while using the mouse to click the songs
on/off?

3. The 3rd-person views all seem difficult to utilize due to weird
perspective and clipping behaviors. This causes me to wind up closer
to the trailing mobs than I expected far too often. I just discovered
the 7 and 1 number pad keys last night for zooming in and out and have
yet to try it out. Does that help a great deal or even at all?
