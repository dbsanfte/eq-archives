Not saying this guy is a scam, but the biggest scam at the moment is the
following:

Some guy is legit *cough* selling his uber character "Uberleet" for say,
US$600 and Scammer offers to buyout and immediately advertises a
non-existant uber-uber-uber character "Ownjoo" which just happens to be for
US$600 as well . Some poor sucker jumps at the chance to pick up "Ownjoo" at
such a bargain price and Scammer tells him that his paypal address is that
of the legit guys selling "Uberleet".

Legit guy get's his US$600 from (unknowingly) the buyer of "Ownjoo" (is told
it's a friends or relatives Paypal account of Scammer) and releases username
and password for "Uberleet" to Scammer. Within an hour "Uberleet" is
stripped to the bone itemwise and sacrificed down to level 46 for essence
emeralds.

The buyer of "Ownjoo" quickly realises that he has been scammed when he does
not hear from Scammer again and reverses the paypal transaction. The
previous owner of "Uberleet" loses his cash and eventually may recover a
stripped level 46'er if he is lucky. The seller of "Uberleet" and the buyer
of "Ownjoo" now have the shit fight to end all shit fights with each other
without realising (or too late) that there was a middleman who left a
virtually non-existant paper trail and who made a tidy buck selling all the
items and essence emeralds for cash, or plat even. The plat is later sold
for cash.

Scammer proberly lives in Russia anyway so there isn't shit anyone can do. A
few scams like that and the Russian scammer just doubled his yearly wage.

So, next time you see some fella selling a stack of essence emeralds or a
CoF cheap in auction....chances are it's someone downstream from a scammers
food chain. They will be picked up quick smart by the proffessional
buyers/sellers and price inflated back to normal prices within days. Self
laundering system...

Currently 10Kpp sells easily for 50-60 USD. A single scam on a top notch
unstripped character can easily reap 200Kpp+ with even a innefficient
downstream so the scammer just cleared around US$1000.

Buyer beware eh? Buyer bloody better be aware...
