To JaZZ, thanks for the kind words old friend.

To the OP,  hang in there as playing a rogue only gets better as you level.
You will learn the joys of high damage backstabs, evading off of a killer
mob, pickpocketing your first Sandgiant and dragging most of your guild's
corpses out of the bowels of some dungeon on a massive CR.  A nearly
foolproof sneak/hide is heaven for those short breaks when you have to step
away from the keyboard in RL.   I do agree with your comments on rogues not
being the role-playing solo characters they should be.  I wish verdant would
fix that by changing poisons just enough so that a rogue could enjoy limited
success
soloing as a high level character.  I wouldn't even mind if it was cost
prohibitive because I think the gameplay enjoyment of some solo, high risk
fights would outway the downsides.  (/em steps off my preaching stool.) :-)
