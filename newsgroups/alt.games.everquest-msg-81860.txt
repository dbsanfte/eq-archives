I don't know if anybody else has seen this, but in the Bazaar there is
a merchant named Merchant Tekrama that sells something called a
Traders Satchel.  It's a no drop bag that sells for 1 pp.  Holds giant
items.  The down side is that it weighs 25.  Not good for carrying
around, but pretty nice for padding out the bank slots.
