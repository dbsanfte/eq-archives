All PoP, OoW, GoD and LDoN spells are now researchable.  This includes 
all of the previously harder to get level 69 and level 70 OoW spells.

At the moment it's cheaper to know someone doing the research and to get 
the components, but over time, the prices of the finished spells will 
drop and it'll be easier just to buy them.

It also means, if you don't have spell X in your spell book, and you 
hand in the rune and get it, you can then sell it, if you wanted.
