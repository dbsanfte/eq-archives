I have two main points you might consider.
The first is to choose agnostic for the religion. I can go just about
anywhere with my human mage because of it. Forty kills in the Warrens and I
was able to go into Paineel. Of course VI screwed with faction for about a
week and I had to gate out of Paineel while my pet taunted a guard so I
could get the spell off. But anyways, They put the faction back to where it
was the first week the Warrens were introduced and now I am able to enter
every city on the mainland, Odus, and Faydwer. Cabilis is another whole
ballgame but give me time. As an agnostic I have found it very easy to raise
and lower faction enough to get into areas and do quests that normally I
should not even be able to find out about. I have started a gnome mage on
the Saryn server to test out the same theory.
The second reason I love playing my Magician is the pet. I make more money
with my mage than all other characters combined and I have some that are in
their late 30's. By simply targeting a monster and clicking a hot button,
/pet attack, my pet can kill more critters faster than I can loot them and
sell to a merchant.
With my 12 mage in the Paineel newbie zone I can gather six backpacks full
of bonechips in less than two hours. Include all the other snake eggs for
food, batwings and snake scales for sale to shaman and you can get an idea
how much money there is to be made. Yes you can sell a stack of bone chips
for two or three plat just about anywhere OR you can go somewhere like
Highpass Hold and hold a true auction and get as high as 6 plat a stack from
SK and Necros that don't want to leave a good group just to go hunt a level
two decaying skellie and hope it drops a bone chip. Pickclaws drop good
stuff for them in Highpass Hold and they usually give my mage a bonus like
gems or more cash or some cured silk they have taking up space in the bank.
Once your mage gets to level eight, there is no excuse for being cash poor
ever again. My 12 mage has about 3,000 plat in the bank and is almost ready
to go on a buying binge to make future leveling safer. Program those hot
keys with commands and you find playing a mage an enjoyable pastime. By the
by, my other main character is a shaman and since a mage has virtually no
buffs except Invis, it is nice not to be bugged by lots of people for SoW
every five seconds. Got a corpse run or a friend does? Conjure a weapon,
food, water, bandages, light source, and other various things to help with
the journey. Max out your beg skill on your pet, you won't get attacked by
it ! Waiting for a boat or another player to join you? Practice conjuring
stuff like bandages and then you have them ready to give out or max out your
own bind wound skill. Want to be a tailor? You have possibly the best class
for it because once again your (water)pet can go kill green spiders or
spiderlings for silks to help you increase your skill level. For spiderlings
I suggest the Everfrost newbie area because of rapid spawns and a side
benefit of woolly fungus which is used in a shaman quest and can also be
eaten as a food! There are no snakes in this zone so they added the fungus
to take the place of snake eggs like most other newbie areas have. Once you
are no longer to advance your tailoring skill with spiderling silks it's
time to choose from the many areas that have larger spiders. I know I write
too much but the moral of my short novel here is that a mage can be a money
making machine and I have learned more about the mechanics of skills and the
game itself with this class than any other I play. Yes, exp can be slow
because of the pet eating half of it when you solo BUT he will save your
hide when you gets add ons in the middle of battle. Never underestimate the
power of a mages pet. Add in the spellcasting they do and the duel wield and
bash and fast attacks they get later on, you will come to love your cute
little servants.
