So you agreed to pay for a worthless rock.  The courts would hold you to
that.  Courts don't protect people from their own stupidity, they just
uphold the law, and will generally force adherence to a contract that
doesn't have "unconscionable" aspects (that's a pretty high standard).

See "unconscionable".  =P

Oh, much to the contrary.  You go to a judge and say "I knew it was
worthless, but I expected you to let me out of the contract" and the result
will be entirely predictable.

You are unequivocally wrong.

USC Article 2-206:

"(1) Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or
circumstances 

(a) an offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in
any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances; 
(b) an order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment
shall be construed as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship
or by the prompt or current shipment of conforming or non-conforming goods,
but such a shipment of non-conforming goods does not constitute an
acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is
offered only as an accommodation to the buyer."

Translated: "If you offer to buy a worthless rock for $1k, you are stating
that upon delivery of said *conforming* worthless rock, you will pay the seller
$1k."

Now, if you were being sold a "moon rock" and got a *non-conforming* (pay
attention to these words, they're important) worthless rock instead, *then*
you could avoid paying.
