Sneak is a limited invis that works as long as the affected MoBs have
the player in their rear 180 degree arc.  It also has the feature
that it is not broken by quest hand-ins, unlike hide and invis which
are effectively broken by such an act.

By combining invis and sneak, one can approach the rear of the target
under invis and then do the quest turn in under sneak.  One uses feign
death as a safety valve for unexpected problems.  And for the walk-away,
one can either sneak (if rear arcs are available) or /quit and then
use the invisibility (now restored to effectiveness by the re-log)
or the 15 second faction buffer to make a clean getaway.
