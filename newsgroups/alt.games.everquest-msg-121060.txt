I think I get what you're saying and I agree. Lately, they've been
doing bigger patches but patching less frequently. The problem with
this is, the more you change, the more chances there are to fuck
something up (All the testing in the world isn't going to catch all
the fuck-ups before it goes live, either.)

Problem is, people gripe louder about more frequent patches than they
do about hiccups caused by patching too much at once but patching less
frequently. I think they do need to go to a weekly schedule, take
smaller steps.
