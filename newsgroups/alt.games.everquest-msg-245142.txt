I agree with you for the most part but that point is wrong.  It only
applies if you are grouping with people that you know.  If you are
just a name on a LFG list then being good doesn't help.... all that
helps is the perceived usefulness of your class.

Have been fairly lucky with groups so far.  Always fine the worst
players to be the ones who start "I have a 65th level xxxx main so I
know what I am talking about".  Often not the case as they can't play
their alt nearly as well as they claim to play there main and they
also try to harrangue(sp?) the guy in the party who is playing the
class of their main.  People have different play styles - just because
a level 30, 50, 60th level player doesn't play the way you do does not
necessarily mean they are wrong.
