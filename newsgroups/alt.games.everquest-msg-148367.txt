Ok, here's the question:  I just started using the new interface so I
could access the bazaar.  Everything seems to go ok until the first
time I group.  I right click the Main Chat window and the menus come
up.  I choose group from the channel menu, and it appears that all the
filters (say, group, guild, ooc, etc.) are all asterisked. It appears
that I can speak to my group, but I can't hear them speaking to me.
What the hell am I missing?
