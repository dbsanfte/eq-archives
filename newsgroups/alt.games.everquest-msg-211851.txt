In xp crunching mode under good condition I was clocked around 200 dps and
the pet was 55 or 60 so I was averaging 250.  I had around 30 ticks of mana
regen.  I was able to keep my damage around this much most of the time.  In
closed quaters like a dungeon my dps goes down quite a bit.  I am a 62
magician.
