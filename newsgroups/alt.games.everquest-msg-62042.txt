Often times I've grouped with people who apparently have a hard
time communicating what they mean. This can be a problem sometimes
but usually you can tell what someone means by what theyre doing.
Since the internet is a worldwide network our gaming experiences
can end with with lots of different people. For example, I was in
a Dreadlands group one time consisting of: me (a texan), an englishman
, a german, a frenchman, an aussie and someone from taiwan. Needless
to say I could tell from the language being spoken who was from where.
I gotta hand it to people who English is not their native language.
They speak better english than some people here do. It can get funny
though when were going to pull something or trying to coordinate an
attack and trying to interpret what they mean. One time it was a confusion
with "become" and "because". Now try to imagine logging into a taiwanese
server or a french server for that matter and not understanding a damn
thing being said. It wouldnt be too awful fun would it? I bet a lot of
us wouldnt even try. That being said, if someone in your group is
talking weird or not communicating very well, try to find out if theyre
foreigners (like i actually live in antonica....hehe) or if theyre
young. I was in an OT group where some jerk was really belittling a
druid who turned out to be from Taiwan and was doing her best to get
her point across. Thats like people who just talk louder at a person
who doesnt understand your language as if thats gonna make them understand
that much faster. Hey, go easy on them guys....imagine if the roles were
reversed.
