Not only that, but the shaman incomplete heal is quite a bit more mana 
efficient than Stoicism as well.  I have Stoicism, and it's now at the 
back of my book somewhere.

Stoicism base is 640hp for 180 mana.  3.56 hp/mana
Incomplete heal is 1950 for 400 mana.  4.88 hp/mana
Torpor is 1200 for 200 mana.  6 hp/mana
Quiescense is 1200 for 200 mana (no ill effects).  6 hp/mana

Stoicism has a better ratio than all of the regular heals, worse that 
incomplete heal, much worse than Torpor and Quiescense.  Stoicism, like 
Torpor and Quiescense can be extended by buff extension items, I have the 
shawl, which works up to level 65 spells, so no worries there about the 
focus item level for me.

Stoicism is far easier to get than the torpor or quiescense, but, by the 
time you can cast Torpor, you have access to a better heal spell.  Once 
you have the AAs to extend buffs by 50%, Stoicism becomes a better ratio 
than the incomplete heal, but still sucks compared to torpor and 
quiescense (which are also extended).  I can't extend 50% yet, so I will 
stick with my incomplete heal for now, and work at buying a copy of 
torpor.

For casting while fighting, Stoicism is better than the incomplete heal, 
just because the cast time is lower, so more likely to succeed, but, for 
a fast emergency heal, Tnarg's Mending is even better, as it casts even 
faster, and heals for more, although at a lower hp to mana ratio.
