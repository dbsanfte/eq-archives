So?

Tradeskilling in EQ1 is an acquired taste. Its part of the game, but 
many people playing the game don't have the slighest interest in it, and 
don't do it.

No. Its stupid to ask your guild to farm 0xp mobs forever, but that's 
your choice. Sony doesn't require you to do it, and you don't have to 
use characters that are high level to do it. 

Its only stupid, when you *chose* to do something that isn't required 
with characters that don't benefit from it.
