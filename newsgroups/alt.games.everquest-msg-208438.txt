Well there is a Velious era mob, the Sleeper; when awakened he
goes on a rampage across several zones, and then can never be
spawned again, furthermore his zone, ST, changes so some mobs
that were there are now also gone forever, and other mobs are in
their place with different loot tables.

Noone has ever actually killed the Sleeper (except perhaps some
people that did so using an exploit that got them banned from the
game?) and so we don't know what would happen if someone did.
There aren't many servers on which he hasn't been spawned left...
Strom and what else?  So who knows, maybe something big would
happen if you could.

What happens when you spawn him and don't kill him is certainly a
big change for those few players high enough level to actually
get into ST and play around, that content vanishes totally and
you have to deal with the (apparantly lesser) substitute content
instead from then on.

To most people in the game, its no more than another messed up GM
event where some ultra powerful creature zones into where they
were peacefully playing and kills them for no reason they can
comprehend, and they later hear something changed in a zone so
uber they'll probably never see it.
