	I jumped for joy when I got the OOW HOT.  Makes my game.  But I can
count the number of times I've had to use placate (70 pacify) since I got
it.  Once, :-) in Trial of Subversion.  It worked...  Stuns?  I sometimes
use a stun when soloing.  I've tried to use them on casters in group
situations and (just like my nukes) they get resisted so much I stopped
and went back to sit-stand-heal.  

	If SOE really wanted to spice up the cleric's lives they'd add
a couple of OOW class zones with high level undead mobs.  Now *that*
would be fun.

	How so?  I mean, how so any more than any other expansion?  IMHO
OOW made it ***much*** easier for new players to catch up, at least if 
they're willing to buy gear in the bazaar or have a few higher level
friends.  All that OOW junk, Veil of Vendor Trash, Gloves of Rejected Loot, 
you know, all that stuff with 100mana/100HP you can buy for 500 plat...
