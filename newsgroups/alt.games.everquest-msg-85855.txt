We just got a new puter built by some guy out of the paper.  I just found
out as we got the puter that it was duron.  he told me that duron was better
than a celeron.  I said it was the same as a celeron and it was a piece of
junk.  Is it true?  Is a duron better than a celeron?  Gamers know the best.
Any info would be appreciated.  Thanks


Sheri
