While you're in the bazaar check out the prices on Bat Skull Earrings.
Not sure what you've got already, or what prices are on your server, but
I've seen them come down below 100 plat on ours. +5 INT in the ear slot
is a pretty good bang for your buck INT wise, and IIRC, they can be worn
by all INT casters, if not other classes as well.

There's also a couple of Necro quests in Temple of Sol Ro you can likely
do if you have some friends to help. (A Necro with friends? EEEEK! :-p )
You can pick up some INT there as well for cheap or for free.
