Can someone explain what exactly "botting" is?  And some say they can run
their character with macros?  Are they meaning that their character monitors
the chat text & when key words or phrases are said, they respond?  Wouldn't
this require something either running in memory or monitoring the text file
then sending the command to the system to hit the certain keys on the
keyboard (I guess doing something directly to EQ wouldn't be needed?...just
tell your system you hit those keys, weather or not you did)?
