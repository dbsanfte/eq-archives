Thanks for an inspirational post.  I enjoyed Mark's follow-up also.  I've just
been playing for a few weeks.  I use my sons' account, and have just one
character.  I didn't know much at all about the game when I chose the
character, but I'm having lots of fun with him.  He's a Wood Elf Druid.  I
picked this combination because it seemed pretty well-rounded.

I appreciate what you have to say about how to play the character.  So far
I've had to learn what I know from two kids, the older of whom is just 10.
I'm not complaining; they've taught me a lot.    :o)

Bill
