i  personally  think  you  can  never  have enough  clerics  around ,  being
a professional  warrior . as  a cleric  i'm  almost  always  CoH  then
camped  . xtra  clerics  mean   you  can  do  a CH  rotation  on  main  or
alt  assists ,  with  10  clerics  you  can  have CH  rotation  on  a MA
and  CH  rotation  set  on  a  2ndary  assist  without  losing  a  beat  .
usefullness of  SK  is  easy  over  monks ,  sk  fill  2  rolls  where monks
fill  one basic then  just  a damage dealer .

tell  your  warrior  to  explore  the advantages  of  evasive disc (  lev
52 )  instead  of defensive  vs mobs  that  rampage or flurry .  evasive
means they  won't  "proc" flurry  or  rampage and  you  end up  taking  less
damage  over all . take  an  sk  over  a  warrior  as  MA  on  every  mob
that  you  " just  run accross "  to  the boss mobs because of  how fast
and  easy  they  get  aggro . warriors  take  time to  grab  aggro , even
with  chanter  aggro  increasers .

the  question  was  rate  classes  by  usefullness,  not rate  which  class
is best  for  certain  situations .
