As a network engineer, my interpretation of this law does not mean
firewalls are illegal.  Firewalls do not hide identity, rather they
protect identity theft.  There will be at least one interface with a
published IP address which can be used to identify the organization
associated with that IP.  I think the spirit of the law is to make it
illegal for people to do things like proxy off anonymous servers and
hide their true identity.   Consider this analagous to someone driving
a car without a license plate.  If this person ran over someone and
took off, witnesses and police would have a very hard time identifying
who that person was.  Likewise, a hacker could hack a vulnerable
server and bounce off it thus hiding his identity.  From there he
could launch a massive distributed denial of service attack against a
core router and bring down a large part of the Internet. The
authorities would have a hard time identifying the perpetrator.
