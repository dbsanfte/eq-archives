Unless you go shouting about it. no one will ever know its not you, your
husband or your daughter or your son playing another character on the same
account.
so the whole family could play on 1 account and just not touch each others
characters.

Think of it this way. 4 computers 4 accounts 4 family members. if you are on
cable or Dsl then you can all play at once. you already have almost a full
group made up. Each of you make characters that compliement each other EX
Monk (Shaman or druid) Cleric Warr
you have an awesome setup. no worrying about who gets what loot. no LFG for
hours. A fun Family activity
