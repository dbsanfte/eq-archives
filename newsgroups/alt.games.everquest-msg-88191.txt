Just seems like more effort than it's worth.  You report him, he gets a new
account, and comes back with "HAW HAW HAW EYE GOTTA NEW ACCOUNT!  EWE CULDNT

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
