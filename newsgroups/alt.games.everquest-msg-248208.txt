There is hope,EA canceled Ultima Online 2,when they finally
realized that it would kill Ultima Online,leaving them with
2 games,each without enough subscribers to make a
profite.

There is a closer threat to EQ in the near future,
the next expansion,sorry forgot the name :).
I play almost only Ldon;when the same thing happens
to Ldon,what happens to the old world with the PoP
expansion,they will loose a lot a lot of subscribers
including me.
My interest in grinding out new levels has reached zero,
I simply want to play the game,not worrying about if 
my level is high enough to find a group,had enough of this
from 55 to 64.
I think its a very bad idea to raise the level cap,cant see
on any messageboard that I read,that there was the 
demand for that,why not simply add some more aas?
Again,I wonder where they got the idea to raise the level cap,
please someone tell me,or show me the overwhelming  :)
numbers of postings that demand that crap.
