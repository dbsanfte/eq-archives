It may not be a lack of imagination, but rather an identification with the
character they name themselves after. There was a time when I thought I was
the only one who had ever read The Hobbit, and if I had decided to play a
wizard on Everquest shortly after, I may well have chosen Gandalf, or a
variant that the name filter would allow.

If I had just read the story from one of Wagner's operas, then I might have
chosen the name Klingsor, or something similar. Not so much a lack of
imagination, but flattery through imitation.
