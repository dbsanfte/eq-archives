You could always ask someone who gets rolled back.

The game had been running for an hour by the time the tradeskill vendors
were killed, there were 168 people in PoK on Fennin.  How many people had
been XP'ing for an hour?  I don't care why they didn't do a full server
rollback, if they think they can do individual rollbacks that seems like a
better solution generally.

I'll ask people I know to have purchased stuff on the vendors and see if
they get rolled back - and then make a judgement.

Oh dear, you didn't even bother to ask anyone if they got rolled back?  Oh
dear.  Sorry your toys seem to be 50 feet from the pram.
