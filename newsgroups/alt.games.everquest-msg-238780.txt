Agreed, although you can count on decent exp if you do an assassinate
in Mir since you know you'll be killing a lot of mobs. It's
occasionally a nice change of pace if you don't mind that fact that it
will probably take you an hour to complete. 

As for which is easiest, a bard I know that's pulled around 200 LDoN
claims that Ruj is the easiest (on hard) with Mir a pretty close 2nd.
