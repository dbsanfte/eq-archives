i'm hoping i can make an actual contribution here . . .

you say 2 enchanters, both mezing (obviously buffs / debuffs aren't the
issue)

but do you mean mezing ?  in AOE groups my enchanter has joined, i would
rarely mez- i was ALWAYS stun


a 49 enchanter, using all available AOE stun spells, can keep all PB mobs
stunned indefinitely, if he times his spells correctly

at 52, we get another stun (such that even a chimp could keep mobs
permanantly stunned), and then as levels go up our resist rates drop

^ i say that because you made it seem like you're describing a 55+ aoe group
doing lvl 45-50 mobs, so it should hold true

i have never died in aoe group participation, though obviously not many have
as much aoe group "stick time" as straight exp groups, and i haven't had the
luxury of aoe grouping w/ another enchanter

*thus* i'm guessing you either meant to say that your aoe group setup would
have more than 10 mobs, and the ones that wouldn't "fit" in spell range
would have to be mez'd, OR you meant that if enchanters chain-cast aoe mez,
that the mobs will hold still well enough?

2 enchanters casting constant aoe stuns could more than handle those mobs,
keeping them permanantly stunned, and that would be the smartest way to run
your aoe group

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

now leave the 2 enchanters in the middle of the battle, because they'll be
fine

i'm going to say YES to the druids - you could use druid power . . they
would stand outside the PB for most spells, but they're substantial as aoe
nukers and much more common than, say, a mage at lvls 55+

having mages would be fun, but it would have to be a 55+ one, IMO . . . but
really, as far as i can say, there should never ever be a tank in an aoe
group, thus the pet would be worthless when things were going well, so don't
sweat the mage


anyway, this sounds like quite the strategy, and i wish you well

i'd like to hear how your plans play out

hopes no mages summon him to show off their nuking power, and hopes for
other flaming even less
