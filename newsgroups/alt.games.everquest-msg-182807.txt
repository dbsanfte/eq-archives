    Hmmm... Trying to remember back to lvl 16... nope I didn't share your
attitude to death then. It was damned scary, and I hated evey CR I had to
do. Well you know not hated but certainly avoided them where possible. At
higher levels, that tiny bit of exp you lose amounts to HOURS of lost time.
I like the death system in EQ and think its very appropriate. Wait until you
get your corpse stuck at the bottom of a dungeon before you say its not hard
enough :)

    Seriously, how many times have you died? Would you actually want to
start at level 1 again for all of those?! Or lose all your equipment? At the
higher levels some equipment can take MONTHS to get.... nobody would play
the damn thing if dying meant losing it all.

    I know this is a bit of a glib answer, but it sounds like you're
missing... all the other classes!

    Attack/tank, heal repeat..... that's all warriors do. If you're bored
doing that, why not try a more complicated class?
