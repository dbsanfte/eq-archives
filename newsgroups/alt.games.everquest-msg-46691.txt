Falsadoom is a character in Conan the barbarian, i seem to recollect,
a completely-unhinged Set-worshipping Messianic madman. IIRC James
Earl Jones plays him and, as the only person with the REMOTEST claim
to acting prowess in that tremendously camp film, TOTALLY steals the
show. He has long hair, but i'm sorry to say no beard or sandals
worthy of the name. On the other hand he has a Mountain of Power.
Recommended, and perhaps an insight into the original poster's
self-image.

i DO look forward to Falsadoom's posts, and found this particular one
to be truly outstanding. In the UK we have a similar phenomenon on
teletext, the Ceefax letters on BBC1 p145 - unfortunately they are
always rather short [because of the nature of the medium]. But i
always read them, and recommend them to other connoisseurs of what,
for want of a better term, we may call Falsadoomism.
