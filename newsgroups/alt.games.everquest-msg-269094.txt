Can you actually refute my point?

"power inflation", and preventing it (without driving off or
frustrating players) is one of the major issues in RPG design -- CRPG,
MMORPG, and P&P RPG. If you think this isn't an issue, please,
enlighten us with your wisdom. Every RPG from "brown box" D&D to the
latest computer games has had to deal with it -- I'm curious as to why
you dismiss it so casually.

(A cynical person would answer "Because he has no clue what he's
talking about", but I try not be cynical...)
