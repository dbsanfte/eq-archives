If I may suggest, and provided you have Velious, you can try hunting Snow
Cougars in Iceclad. Since you're a Ranger, you should be able to easily Fear
kite them solo. Occasionally, they drop Cougar Claw Earrings (4 AC, +3 STR,
+2 DEX and 0.5 weight). -Which are all really nice Ranger stats.

It's pretty nice, stable experience, but as a warning those cougars seem to
be pretty magic resistant and socially aggro, but as long as you can get
Snare to take hold you'll live pretty comfortably.
