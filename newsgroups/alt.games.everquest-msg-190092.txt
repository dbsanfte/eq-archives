I think you miss the point.  Local traders would be players, selling what
they have in their regular trader satchel.  You couldn't sell something
until you actually had it in your posession.  The NPC Brokers would be to
give a local buyer access to items in other cities.

Say you are in Freeport.  You do a Bazaar search for a specific item, which
turns out to only be for sale in Felwithe (The seller would be seen on the
list as not a player, but a city, and right clicking would point you at the
correct broker).  You proceed to the Felwithe broker and buy the item
through that broker.  The item is immediately removed from the Felwithe
player selling the item and "timed" for delivery in Freeport.  The broker
has payed the Felwithe player, so he is done with the deal.  The buyer gets
the item only when it makes the transit to Freeport.  This could be slow,
simulating transport by coach and boat, or immediate, simulating the broker
has the ability to teleport the item. If the item were available locally,
you would go to the player character actually selling the item and make a
purchase the same as in the regular bazaar.  If you were buying the item to
resell it, you could not put it up for sale until it was actually in your
posession.  Declining the item means you have paid the broker fee, but do
not pay for the item.  The broker then has it in his local inventory and
sells it at the purchased price or NPC regular sale price, whichever is
higher.  Eventually, it disappears from the NPC's inventory if no player
buys it, just like any NPC merchant.

The advantage, again, is that players buying and selling are spread over all
the cities, keeping each bazaar very small.  Depending on faction, you may
have to travel to get to a place that deals in or with the goods you are
seeking, but, you don't have to travel to put your goods up for sale.  For
instance, you won't find a Neriak representative in Felwithe.  That KOS
thing just gets in the way.  But, I believe Dark Elves are tolerated in
Qeynos, so there would be a Neriak broker in the Qeynos bazaar.

Cheers,
Eric
