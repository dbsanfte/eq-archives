Considering giving FV a shot. I two box now on another server and will do
the same here.

Considering Iksar shaman and Iksar Necro, or Iksar shaman and Halfling
Ranger, or Iksar shaman and DE SK, or finally waiting until frogs and doing
Frog Shaman & Frog Paly.

I currently do barb shaman + troll warrior. Good duo, but was thinking of
trying the iksar for the shaman weapon quests, since I don't have even one
piece of equipment on the barb the iksar can't use. Sure the JBB won't be
available to the iksar but when two boxing I don't miss that.

Necro would be nice for the fear kiting aspect, but then I might as well
just play a necro solo.
The ranger might be nice for tracking and finding those hard to find mobs.
Plus wolf form when I start the shaman epic to get into freeport.

SK might be nice since it would have the fear kiting ability, but also be
able to tank the mobs a bit. Avoiding the iksar here just because lack of
the plate armors.

Of course the shaman and paly would be a novelty that might be fun, plus
some extra healing.

Shaman is easy to play as a support character especially once pets show up.
And the slows help tremendously when in the 50's and hunting, not to mention
good to get into groups.

Any other suggestions on a good 2 box?
