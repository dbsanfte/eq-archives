There are ways to stretch to cover that (I remember a DE Cleric who's
CHeal macro was something like "Kaev you have not yet sufferred enough,
HEAL!", for example), but since EQ involves a lot of repitition, even
when you are constantly seeking novelty, it would wear thin pretty
fast.  And then you'd be stuck with either forgoing your roleplay or
spending much of your time alone and friendless (tho in the case of
a cleric of Bertoxx that in itself would fit the roleplay, heh).
