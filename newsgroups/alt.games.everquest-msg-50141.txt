As posted on everquest.com, a review concentrating on horses:

http://www.cgonline.com/previews/everquest-01c-p2.html

Some key quotes from Jeff Butler:

"The thought is that they will be symbols of status, and the desire is that
more exotic appearances or higher maximum velocities will be more
expensive,"

"players on foot won't be disadvantaged because all of a sudden monsters can
run faster to make up for horseback riding."

"The horse will essentially be part of your character model, for all intents
and purposes, and nothing more," asserts Butler. "He won't have his own hit
points, he won't have his own fighting ability, he won't lend to or detract
from your fighting ability,"

"You can't use them as roving banks or backpacks or containers,"

For the super-rich, there is always the possibility of the two-horse stable,
too, "so that when they die, at their bind point they run back and get their
horse whistle and ride their horse out to their body...."
