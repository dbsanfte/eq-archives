It's not tricky, cast asap, it dispells sow. A sow'd mob in a dungeon
that runs, is instant train city. Both the snare and root will wear
off, but the root doesn't dispell sow. Someone else said they don't
recommend creating a DE Cleric or Troll Shaman just for the necklace.
Of course you don't, but IMO, it has made me very happy with my
decision.

Monk was a suggestion for DPS, and the Feign Death (SK will do). I two
box often. I have a Troll Shaman and an Iksar Monk. The Shaman is a
bot most of the time. I buff up the Monk and have regen on my Shaman.
As soon as he is done buffing I hit the CANNI-dance hotkey and switch
to the monk for the pull. (I am talking about Sol A again) Go pull
with monk bring back up to three of the Goblins, and slow with the
shaman all three. (In order to make targeting the mobs easier, have
your partner switch between the three targets and simply assist him,
this will also decrease the chance of drawing aggro) Cast some spot
heals, and the occaisonal Cold-nuke, canni hotkey. When the monk get's
to the last mob, click the snare necklace immediately, then once it
has stuck, canni-dance hotkey and switch back to the monk to finish
the goblin. Once to half health I would switch back to the shaman and
nuke it so that it would try to run. With the monk's dps, and your
occaisonal nukes you can get a goblin in Sol A to run before the snare
has worn off.

The Feign Death is very important, there will be times when you run
into a wizard. If you aren't at full health and with good resist buffs
on, they will hand you your a$$. What I would do with a wizard, is
bring him back with the monk and once he got there start nuking the
piss out of him with the shaman. If necessary healing the monk. If I
over-nuked and drew aggro from him, it was ok, because that way I was
spreading the damage out between the two.

One thing, even with the Troll's regen and a regen spell, I recommend
getting an Iksar Ceremonial Chestplate. I think with that, my Trolls
regen rate was 12 standing, 16 sitting. Makes mana a non-issue. IMO
better than a horse, simply because I prefer dungeoneering.

Here was my Canni hotkey:

/sit off
/pause 2, /cast 8
/pause 37, /cast 8
/pause 37, /cast 8
/sit

My other spells like slows and nukes were hotkeyed like this:

/sit off
/pause 3, /assist <MONK>
/pause 2, /cast 1
/pause 30, /cast 1
/sit

I put the cast in twice so that if it fizzled the first time it would
try again.
Aside from buffs I only cast my nuke, slow, heal and canni. So I
recommend keeping gate memmed. Wish I had.

Doing all of this, I was able to pull non-stop for the most part in
Sol A from level 27-30. The only exception being when I had to take
down Wizards. And one time when I forgot to snare a Shaman, it ran and
started a massive train. Luckily my monk was holding off the train
till the Troll got gate memmed and cast. The Monk FD'd (again I
emphasize the importance of FD) with less than 50 HP. I made those
three levels for both characters in 6-8 hours, and tons of fine steel.

So, in my opinion, none of this would have been as easy if I didn't
have the necklace. If that is the only time in my shaman's career (it
isn't) that I get that much benefit from it, it was worth the choice
of a Troll Shaman of Innoruuk.
