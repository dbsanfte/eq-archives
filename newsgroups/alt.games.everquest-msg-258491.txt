I can give nothing on EQ, alas, but I can give you the following. It's 
all iirc, from beta, early game...:
SWG does indeed use Oracle. Oracle version 8. They were using 9, but 9 
has a bug that SoE found (memory leak). Oracle gave them an ETA on 
getting the bug fixed of 24-48 months, so they went back to 8, which 
broke any number of things (this was fortunatly beta).

And yes, they bought a certain database size, and had to squeeze a bit 
to get stuff in. A lot of the early problems though had to do with 
writing and optimising for Oracle 9 for 2 years, and suddenly dropping 
back to 8. Having done something similar myself with a database, I 
believe it. The 'first week' problems which caused the melon wipes were 
due to needed better optimizations on handling certain item tags.

As I understand it, the next 'size' database license was 10x as big (far 
bigger than they needed) and 40x as expensive (which, given Oracle, I 
fully believe).
