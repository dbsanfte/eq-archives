It depends on the spell.   Most offensive spells will cause less aggro if
they are resisted than if they had landed for damage.

From my experience, debuff spells cause *more* aggro when they are resisted
than when they land.

It also makes sense in terms of game mechanics.   From a mobs (or a
programmer trying to use a mob to kill a group) point of view, a resisted
debuff *should* cause more aggro.  If a shaman has slowed you... the damage
is already done.   Even if you kill the shaman then, you're not going to get
out from under the slow spell for the next several minutes.   But if the
shaman attempts to slow you and fails....  quick, kill him before he can try
again and succeed in reducing your damage output.  Killing the shaman before
he can slow will enable you to win more often than killing him after.

For an offensive spell though, it's just the opposite reasoning.   You're
resisting the druid's nuke, so he's not a great threat while using that.
You're much better off killing the wizard who isn't getting resisted,  and
has demonstrated the potential to do massive damage.   If you kill the nuker
who can damage you first, you have a better chance of winning vs killing the
one being resisted every time



Anyways...  I don't have exact figures, but from what I observed with a
variety proc'ing weapons,  stuns tend to aggro the most.   Then resisted
debuffs, then successful debuffs, then direct damage.   (in a general sense,
meaning massive direct damage can obviously place you above minor debuffs,
resisted or not.)

I think it very likely that just as each spell has a specific hate amount
for a successful cast, they each have a specific hate amount for a resist as
well, placed at whatever level the programmer who added it thought
appropriate.
