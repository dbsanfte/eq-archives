}> me  to haste their pet, though.  And sometimes druids and SKs.

}isn't too shabby.

True. for 7.5 minutes.  My nearly as good haste gives them a spell gem 
back for an hour. :)  Hasting a druid pet is an amusing concept anyway in 
most circumstances.  Oooh!  Now the baby bear can hit the ubermob for 2
almost twice as fast! :)

But I don't care how efficient it is, druid pets are cute, and that's 
reason enough to use em. :)
