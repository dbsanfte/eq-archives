So what you are talking about here is a post-apocalyptic Norrath?  No druids
or wizards to port.  No Enchanters to give KEI, no clerics to rezz, no SOW,
no buffs, no money,  just a dagger and rations for all....   Just imagine
the chaos of all those thousands of players all crammed into the newbie
zones fighting over bats and beetles.

I suppose I would start over.  I made it once as a newbie with nothing but
my naked bod and a dagger.  Might be kind of fun.  I guess an Uber raid
would be the Throne Room in CB.  How many 1st level players with daggers or
splintering clubs do you think it would take to kill King Crush?  Just
imagine a raid force of 60 peeps all descending on Crushbone with Clerics
armed with an 8 point heal. (that is if they can afford it)

Actually, now that I think about it, it sounds kind of fun.
