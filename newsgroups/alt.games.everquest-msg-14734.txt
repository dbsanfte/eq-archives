Well, unless their policy is accounts get hacked, and we will ban you for being
a victim, their "ban em all policy" pretty much implies they don't believe
accounts get hacked.

Well, the official company policy is that all stolen accounts will be banned.
You report your account as being stolen, you get banned.

Now, what kind of incentive is that to report it has been hacked?

You really want idiots for friends?

You can keep them all for yourself.

No, but Verant has a policy that accounts are never hacked.

================================================

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."

                   From "Travels with Charlie"
                   by John Steinbeck
