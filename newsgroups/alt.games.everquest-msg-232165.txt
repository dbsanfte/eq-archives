   Thanks for the replies, guys.  I will check on the woven shim choker, and
have filed Remington's post to read when I haven't been drinking and can
actually comprehend more of it.  But I will say that we don't regularly group
with any enchanters at all.  For some reason, the class seems to be somewhat
rare on FV.  Of course, it might simply be that the one that are there beat
cheeks to level to 60 so they can KEI, and thus are still a bit beyond our
reach.
