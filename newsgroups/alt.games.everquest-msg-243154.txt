   Naw.  He killed about billion (more or less) aquagoblins in BB, then got
someone to turn him into a wolf so he could play stuff the dwarf.  I don't
know  that he needed to do one to do the other, you understand, just
reporting what he actually did.

   Now that sounds like a good idea!

Scene:  The PoK

Teapray shouts, in Elvish, 'Want to hire the services of wizard or druid
who is not KOS in the Plane of Growth to be on stand by to port my husband
Lenny, an ogre shadowknight, out of the zone in a hurry should his
sightseeing expedition go badly.  And yes, I mean it."

   Hehe... that alone should be worth the price of admission.
