Depends on what you do, and how you do it, of course.  As a cleric, I
have not been hit by anything the last 4 days of grouping.  (One
exception, Dragoon <something>, but that does not count. :-) If you
play a buffer/healer, are a competent player, and have good tanks, you
could play naked. Equipment does not have anything to say there.

You will gain good faction from handing in the belts.  That counts for
something.

About where one of the /loc numbers hit 10000, I seem to remember.

Also try in the mountains, west of the ogre camp. More bandits, and
less bandit hunters.
