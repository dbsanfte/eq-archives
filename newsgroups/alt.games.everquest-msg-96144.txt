Hello.  I'm curious about Venril Sather and his remains.  For the
ranger/druid epic, if VS is a rare spawn (I've heard only once per week,)
and he must be killed to spawn the remains 24 hours later then: a. Do you
need to camp Karnors with your guild or raid party for days on end hoping
that VS spawns and b. Once you DO get VS dead, does that same group have to
camp Karnors for 24 hours to get the remains?

It just seems to me that such a rare spawn is in such high demand and to get
to VSR, you have to stay online and inside Karnors for days on end with
little or no sleep.  I would think that if you manage to kill VS and get the
remains to spawn, you have to guard it like crazy to keep your epic mob from
being ks'd by another guild.  If anyone knows, please enlighten me.

Thanks.
