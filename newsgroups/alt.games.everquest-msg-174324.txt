There are (at least) two different Gold editions of Everquest. Theodore
Holding outlined the two pretty well.

I bought a "Gold Edition" about last May, obviously not including Planes of
Power. It's a different product to the Gold edition co-released with PoP.
(The version I bought had everything up to Luclin, a mouse mat, and a couple
of maps, in addition to manuals and CD-ROMs.) The version without PoP
comes in a cardboard, not metal, box.

Just make sure you know *exactly* what you are buying.
