 I suppose. I'd rather save them until I see what PoP provides. Who
knows, they may add more AA skills to spend points on.

 Two points is nothing, really.

 Sure, if that's the only mob around for miles. However, in more
populated zones you want mobs to not go around fleeing all over the
place. I'd say with the first level trained it goes off about 20% of the
time. It may be influenced by Dex but I can't be certain. For me it
saves time and lets me get my health up faster.

 Actually, Shadow Knights get a nice Fear Resistance. They get one that
makes them permanently immune to fear spells. 

 Bandage wound sounds like a nice skill though for those who carry
bandages around.

 Well, I was speaking as a Monk who doesn't get a nifty skill like that!
Personally I don't like carrying 400 bandages around everywhere so the
Velious BP is a much better solution. Sure, I heal less per second but I
can live with that for how conveient it is. Velious BP does 100 a cast
now, so 400 a minute plus mend, plus whatever I regen (Iksar) doesn't
leave me with a lot of downtime.

 I'm about halfway there now. With all the raids I doubt I'll have
everything I want trained by the time PoP is released.
