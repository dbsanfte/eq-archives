I'm on the Antonious Bayle Server. I'm usually on around 18:00 Central 
European Time, or in weekends. (Especially next Saturday, since my gf is 
going out with her friends to Amsterdam , and I'm going out with mine in EQ 
SplitPaw or something)

The name is Rosse, and I'm a kindly Troll who's yet to learn normal people 
don't tend to like him :-/
