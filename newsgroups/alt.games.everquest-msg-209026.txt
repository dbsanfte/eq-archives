OK, I see the misunderstanding here.

Who knows, it could be you are correct about how the information is 
stored DT, or, it could be that it is stored as a price, and modifier 
ranges.

In the end, it doesn't make much difference, either way, the end goal 
that was originally discussed here could be achieved, which is to set the 
buy and sell prices to the same value for at least the best 
faction/charisma combination.
