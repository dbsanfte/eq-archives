Well, the good news is that it looks like they're working on making it so
that the windowed mode is superfluous.

Take a look at eqclient.ini in your EQ folder and make a couple changes.

For this issue, change one line to this:
ScreenMode=FULL

While you're there, make this change as well:
RunMode=TRUE  - and you won't have to hit that stupid RUN button every time
you log in.
