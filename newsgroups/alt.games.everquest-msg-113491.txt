It's your responsibility to know what is and isn't allowed.  I'd think by
level 30 you'd know that you're not allowed to buy stuff from EBay.

All that aside, if you wanted to transfer any character keep in mind that
both accounts first have to have the same expansions installed, so you still
have to buy legal copies.

I'm sure you know that a CD-Key for the original game can only be used
once...what made you think that the expansions would be any different?

Please admit that you were stupid, it's the only way to save face.
