It has nothing to do with wanting to keep it hidden.  There is no install
file.  This is Linux.  You have to download the source files from CVS and
compile them.  To just download the source, you run the following commands:

export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@seq.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/seq
cvs login
(hit enter when it asks for password)
cvs -z3 co showeq
cvs logout

and the showeq directory contains all the ShowEQ files you need.
