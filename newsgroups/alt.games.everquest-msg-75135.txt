    Well, my husband and I have tried a variety of
duos.  One of the best so far is Mage/Wizard.  When
we tried it I didn't think it would work all that 
well, we didn't exactly have a great deal of balance.
But it turned out fine.  The pet spots the mob and 
melees, the mage casts her weak DDs and the wizard
stands back in safety and blasts things to bits.
Ok, if one of use ever _do_ draw agro it gets ugly
quick.  But that happens fairly rarely.  
   And when we fight on a mountain top, the whole
thing lights up like a volcano!
