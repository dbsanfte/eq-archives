Fair comments...

- Only groupmembers capable of getting XP would contribute to the
  efficiency bonus.

- With only one extra group member (the most likely bot case), the
  bonus would be fairly minor.

- Anyone capable of botting 5 extra characters at once probably has
  better ways of getting fast XP anyway :)  (Not to mention more money
  than sense)

Well, just a thought.  You're probably right that Verant wouldn't
implement it, but it does seem like a fairly elegant solution to me.
