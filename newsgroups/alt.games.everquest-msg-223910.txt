Just anywhere there are Large Rats, concentrate on them. They now drop a
tail that looks like a snake skin (not sure of the exact name but has the
word "plague" in it) that sells for over a plat to a merchant, even with
lousy charisma and mediocre faction. it is quite a common drop and the rats
themselves are very common. There eyeball they drop is worth around 6 gold
as well.
