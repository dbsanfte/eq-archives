A friend here at work ran it fine under Lindows using WineX before he got 
bored with EQ again.

2 days now without the LD problem since I turned off the Remote Management.  
I'm assuming some kid out there was DoSing me or whatever the latest and 
greatest published hack that the feebs can read in alt.hackers or wherever 
the posers go to play.  I may take the time to drop my old cheesy hub in 
front of my router and drop a linux box in front of it to sniff 'em out.  
Not sure if it's worth the time or not.

Heh.  Just read your other post ( re: Knoppix and overheating ).  I already 
have the latest Mandrake installed on the PII-400 that is offline, so I 
could drop that on the old hub that's currently not in use.  I did steal 2 
of the hard drives out of it for the 2nd EQ Machine, so I'll just  
repartition that now unneeded /home/mp3 mount into /var and /var/www if I 
fire it back up.

Thanks for the suggestions, Tim.
