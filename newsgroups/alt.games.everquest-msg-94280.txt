I just found out yesterday that Spirit of the Eagle (is that the name), a
high level druid buff that includes levitate is bugged.  If you have
levitate up when it is cast on you, you stop levitating.  I did not notice
this at first, I was heading to Siren's Grotto from the CS portal.
Fortunately, the cliff is not that high, only 200 or so damage.  A friend
later in the same journey, we were actually going to DN, just passing
through SG, found the same bug when entering the chasm where the portal to
DN is.  He 10ked.  Just thought I'd let everyone know there is an issue
there, as I understand it, a known issue.
