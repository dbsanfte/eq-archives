Hello,

Thank you for contacting the Sony Online Entertainment Customer Service
department.

We apologize for any inconvenience you may have encountered as a result
of your issue. The problem appears to have been the fault of Sony Online's
patch update, which prevented you from playing on 11/07/01.

Though not normal policy, I will be happy to provide you with the free month
of gameplay due to our error. You should see a credit to your account no
later
than 01/15/02. If you do not, pleas feel free to contact us.

For additional help, please visit our knowledge base service at:
http://www.station.sony.com/services/help.jhtml

If you have any further questions please feel free to email us again, or
call us  Monday through Friday, 8:30 A.M. to 5:30 P.M. PST, at (858)
537-0898.

Customer satisfaction is our top priority.  We would appreciate your
feedback on the level of service provided.  Please feel free to share
your thoughts and concerns by sending an email to
csfeedback@station.sony.com

Regards,

Nate Wright
Sony Online Entertainment CSR
