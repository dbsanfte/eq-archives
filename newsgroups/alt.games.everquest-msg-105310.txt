My original was a question. I didn't know of any other reason why I
couldn't get on. Figured someone here might know. I don't have enough
knowledge of EQ to know if they go down routinely. The only reasons
*I* know of that would keep me from logging on to EQ for 10 minutes
*AND* can't get to the website would be one of two things. My net
access is down (it wasn't) or Sony was hacked. Figured if anyone would
know, it would be the people I thought were dedicated to the game.
Meaning the posters here.

What it's nice to know is that now I can safely scratch "hacking" off
as a possibility since it's so extremely unlikely. As opposed to
Diablo/Blizzard that on more then one occasion was DOS'ed.

You people really are a piece of work. You can't just back off and
realize that I was asking a simple (to you all, unknowledgable)
question and just let it be. Nooooo, you have to spend your day
jumping my shit just because I don't know Sony well enough to know
they aren't hackable.

Get a freaking life already. Or better yet, go back and play the game
you supposedly love so damn much.
