So, the druid would be better off going solo than be weighed down with a 
useless shaman? :-)

Personally I think it's more important that the original poster's friend 
finds 
a class that he enjoys playing, rather than picking the 'ideal' partner for 
a 
druid. I was responding to the post that said a shaman was a "bad" partner 
for 
a druid. Of all the combinations, it seems like a cleric/druid combo would 
be 
the only one that wouldn't work. But then again, if they want to add a 3rd 
player to the group, guaranteed they'd be able to find a tank to join them 
in 
no time at all.
