If that were the case, why did the Bush administration manufacture
evidence and lie to the American public?

That's a pretty complicated subject.  I'm not prepared to discuss it.

Sometimes timing is *everything*.  George W. Bush is a blunderer.

Then why did Bush invade Iraq?  The Bush administration knew Iraq
didn't present a danger to America.

What requirements did Iraq not live up to that justified what the Bush
administration has done?  You don't drop a nuclear bomb on a house to
solve a termite problem.

Enjoy, and please, try to let go of your unwarranted hate.  Clinton
wasn't perfect, but he was an excellent president for this country.

Won't you PLEASE think of the CHILDREN???  *rolls eyes*

It's not okay for children to possibly hear about Clinton's
indiscretions, but it's okay for them to be without healthcare.

Your priorities are way out of whack, man.

I disagree.

He's also ressurected typical republican fiscal irresponsibility,
abuses his supposed faith for votes, he worships greed, he's prideful,
he's put millions more Americans in poverty, while giving tax breaks to
the obscenely wealthy, he bore false witness against his neighbor,
he's damaged the American education system (which wasn't that good in
the first place), the list goes on and on.  There's really too much to
list.

He's probably been the worst president in U.S. history.

What complete nonsense.  You could justify anything with that kind of
(lack of) logic.

America's relationship with Russia wasn't *that* strained in the
1980s.  Viewing Reagan as the savior of the western world is the worst
kind of bizarre idoltry.

Anyway...these are getting pretty long.  I snipped the rest where we
either agreed or will have to agree to disagree.

And since Bush will get re-elected, I guess I've got nothing but a lot
more crying to do.  :(
