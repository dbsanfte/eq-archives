The same is true for most classes, you just get better spells in the same 
lines that you already have spells.  As a shaman, I get better heals 
(instant and over time), better buffs, better DoTs, better nukes, better 
debuffs.  Nothing terribly exciting, except in that they allow me to hit 
harder zones than I could without them, particularly when soloing.
