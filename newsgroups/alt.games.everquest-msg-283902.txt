Both sides are wrong - neither always nor never is the correct answer.  The
necro (like everyone else) should know what roles are available to him, and
choose the one that best helps out in the situation at hand.

EQ combat is about 2 things: doing damage to mobs and removing or preventing
damage to players.  Maybe a third in some cases: preventing mobs from using
abilities like running for help, gating, healing, etc.

Everything you do is in support of one of these things.  A necro gets some
flexibility in which to do: pretty good damage output or pretty weak healing
or mana transfer to a good healer (or barely adequate crowd control).  

In most groups, killing the mob quickly is the best way to reduce the damage
that needs to be healed, and the necro plays to his strengths by concentrating
on this role.

Occasionally, you're fighting things in a group where you have good DPS and
weak healing, or against mobs with high damage and lowish HP, and keeping the
healer fed and helping with heals is your best plan.   This happens more at
mid-high levels when your non-DPS spells have gotten more efficient.  And at
some point, you get enough mana and good enough spells that you can do some of
each at the same time.
