This is not exactly what you're after, but I'm going to make
a suggestion or two that I think will be worth your time.

Get more RAM.  Prices are *cheap* right now -- even shopping
at WorstBuy, you can find a 256Mb stick for around $30 and
a 512Mb for around $50-60 (I'm guessing that you need PC133
RAM).  This will make a monumental improvement in your daily
Windows usage period.  The *minimum* for even running XP
reasonably is 256Mb and you're stripping 32Mb out of that
pool for your video card, which brings me to my second point:

If you can afford another $70 or so, get one of the GeForce4
MX cards.  While they are not true GF4 chips, it is almost
guaranteed to flatten your on-board graphics.

I'd recommend doing the RAM first, since I've seen huge
improvements when all of my friends went from 256 to 512Mb.

Mike
