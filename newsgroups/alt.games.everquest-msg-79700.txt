Was doing a bit of Gornit camping the other day, and had dropped the
phantom satchel that Phantom plate comes in.  When Gornit came up
the hill on me (nuked a tad too early :(  ) he said something like
"Fool to leave such booty lying about, I claim it for the Pirates of
Gunthak!"  When he died it wasn't on him though.
