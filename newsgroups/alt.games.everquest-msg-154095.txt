BTW, I have a 53 druid, 52 wizard as well as my 60 enchanter.  My enchanter
and druid were born in '99 and my wizard in '01.

My wizard never goes /role.  My druid only goes /role when he gets 2+ begs
in newbie zones.  My enchanter has never gone /role...until he hit 60.

Zone into nexus: BAM.../role, unless I have time to kill to fill peoples
addictions.  If I do not, I WILL get a MINIMUM of 10 tells in 10 minutes
from total strangers.   Being a heartless greedy bastard I will ignore at
least 9 of the 10 tells (the greedy comes from my feeling that anyone who
donates less than 75p is a cheapass who has no appreciation what being never
oom for 2.5 hours is worth).

And when I'm a greedy bastard and do KEI for donations I cast first and get
paid after.  If you totally insult me with less than 25p I will belittle
you.  Anything less than 50p I'll not cast on you again but I won't give you
a hard time (unless you ask why I'm not KEIing you 2.51 hours from now).

Some goober level 22 druid paid me 1p...said he was saving up for level 24
spells.  When I told him that next time I'll C2 him for free he told me that
C2 sucks.  I got really tired of PLing people 1.5 years ago...I'm not
interested in PLing anyone anymore...and that's all my buff was to that guy
(anyone who doesn't pay what they obviously feel the spell is worth)...free
PLing.

And if you're /role /anon and want to run to me without mentioning how much
you'll pay me?  I ask you what your class is.  If you're a druid I ask why
you're /anon.  If you answer it's because you hate getting bugged for buffs,
or a wizard who hates getting bugged for ports...guess what?
