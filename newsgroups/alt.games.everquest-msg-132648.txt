Mystery to me, I felt certain you were comparing your 1hs skill with
some other.

750pp is a great price, it sells for 1.5 - 2k on my server.  But if
this ATK jump is real, the price of JBoMs is going to shoot through
the roof!  My 45 ranger is in the range where his melee skills are
capped at 200 (except Dual Wield which is 210), until level 50.
Thus the only way I can increase his ATK is by adding strength.
Currently his strength is 163 and his ATK is 921; but if I can
somehow raise this by triple digits I would be ecstatic!  I plan to
test this soon.  ;-)
