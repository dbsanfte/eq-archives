2 things were causing my crash to desktop

1) Luclin models - I switched them all off

2) On boards Sound - When I upgraded I sold my old system bits by cobbling
together a machine from spare parts. As the old Mboard did not have sound
onboard I had to bundle my trusty old soundblaster in with it. My new mboard
has onboard sound (Via AC'97) so didn't get my self a new sound card.
Disabling the onboard sound fixed all my problems.
