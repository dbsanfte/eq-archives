Easy way to get around your logic here.  Play 1character per server
and it doesnt matter if you are level 60, you dont have a level 1 to
give stuff too.

No?  I would also say that is isnt a challenge  to walk around West
Freeport at 1st or 2nd level with a Springwood Club either.

The other half is having them each earn what they got as an
individual.  Although I have a wealthy warrior, I still had no less
fun killing bats and skellies and orc pawns with my new druid  than I
had when I originally started my warrior.
