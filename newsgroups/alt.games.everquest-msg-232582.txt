Various people have already responded with suggestions both for
settings you can change and/or computer equipment upgrades.  But
for completeness I'll offer a really quick'n'dirty solution:
Look down!

If you're using the first-person view, use the page-down key to
angle your view until you're staring straight down.  The computer
then figures out that there's almost nothing in your field of
view, so it doesn't have to spend a lot of time drawing it (and
then computing what part of it is blocked from view by other
stuff, etc.).  If you've installed a map of the zone, you can
then bring up the map and navigate using that.  If you need to
see something to click on it (e.g. a banker or door), page-up
just enough to see a part you can click on, then page-down again
as you do your banking or move through the door or whatever.
I do this most of the time in PoK and Bazaar, and often in Nexus.

A slightly simpler technique that lets you see a bit more (but
leaves you with more lag) is to switch to the overhead view.
