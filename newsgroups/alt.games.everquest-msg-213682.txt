Nope, it takes a little more because you don't hit often and mostly get skill ups with
successful hits, but over 100 learning slows down even on successful hits, so its slow
again there.  You might have had a point if you'd said "from 99 to100".  But all in
all its pretty fast going all the way up the ladder assuming you have a high dex.  And
generally as you level up you get higher and higher dex gear, as well as access to
better and better dex buffs, the best ones won't even stick to you till you are over
45.
