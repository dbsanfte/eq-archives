My perspective is biased in the sense that random pickup groups are
exactly that.  I've had one mission where we just crushed it, the
mobs melted like butter.  Most of my pulls that time were doubles,
and the Enchanter managed to get himself knocked around some even
with just one mob to mez.  Had a collection in Miragul that was
never in doubt, but not quite a romp.  In both of those the group
asked for double pulls as soon as it was clear we had the mobs
outclassed and I did my best to oblige them.  The other four groups
I've been in just weren't up to anything more than the occasional
double (unsurprisingly all four failed, tho two were close enough
to have succeeded if we'd just played a bit better).

I rejoined my old "family" guild, hopefully I can put together some
guild groups and join or develop a pool of players used to working
together.  No guarantees tho, it is (or was before anyway) a somewhat
dysfunctional "family", heh.
