Simple - if the premise is wrong, someone will point it out.  A lot of 
people here thrive on pointing out if someone is wrong, so I have no doubt 
someone will speak up if Ally isn't needed.

If it's right, I've already asked the questions I need to ask.

Either way, I'll find out if Ally is needed or not.

I could have asked if it was right first, and then asked my questions after 
someone replies "yes", but why break it up into two posts?  This way, I'll 
find out if Ally is needed, and hopefully get my questions answered.
