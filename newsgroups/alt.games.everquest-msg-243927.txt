No, I'm not. Step down off your high horse and understand that you don't 
have some kind of godly insight into everyone's thoughts and motives.

You are quite skilled at twisting the facts in your own interests, but 
that doesn't make you right. Sorry.

I asked a question, "Wouldn't this be the case?" I got a response. I then 
said simply, "Well then, what if it were like this?" If that is what you 
view as arguing, then you lack the capability to differentiate between 
arguing and discussion. 

It's moot at this point, unfortunately. You've put enough effort into 
this attack to back down or consider anything differently. Have at it.

I have no intention of fighting anything. Can you not understand what 
I've been saying, or are you just not reading it?

Rhetoric. Lies. 0 points.

More rhetoric. Bating. 0 points.

Sorry, but you appear to be more interested in building a case here.

Sorry, no it doesn't. I owned up to overreacting at that point in another 
post. That doesn't change what my intentions were and still are now.
