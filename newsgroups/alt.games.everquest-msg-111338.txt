Yes, totally fucking stupid, but I laughed my ass off and decided to
annoy a lot of people and possibly amuse a couple others by posting it
here anyway:

A blonde, wanting to earn some money, decided to hire herself out as a 
'handy-woman' and started canvassing a nearby well-to-do neighborhood.

She went to the front door of the first house, and asked the owner if he
had any odd jobs for her to do.

"Well, you can paint my porch," he said; "How much will you charge me?"

The blonde, after looking about, responded, "How about $50?"

The man agreed and told her that the paint and other materials that she
might need were in the garage.

The man's wife, inside the house, heard the conversation and said to her
husband, "Does she realize that the porch goes all the way around the
house?

The man replied, "She should; she was standing on it. Do you think she's
dumb?"

"No. I guess I'm guilty of being influenced by all the 'dumb blonde'
joke emails we've been receiving."

A short time later, the blonde came to the door to collect her money.

"You're finished already?" the husband asked.

"Yes," the blonde replied, "and I had paint left over, so I gave it two
coats."

Impressed, the man reached into his pocket for the $50.00 and handed it
to her.

"And by the way," the blonde added, "it's not a Porch, it's a Lexus."
