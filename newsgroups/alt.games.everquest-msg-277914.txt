Excuse me,but I did exactly the same,started on a new server to avoid
twinking,Ranger there is 55 now,has Ornate tunic,legs,gloves,Cloak of
Flames,Belt of turtle,Eyepatch of Plunder,etc,etc,and 3k unbuffed hps.
Most people I meet in this level range are worse equipped.
Maybe you should rethink your strategy,plat is very easy to come by,
surprises me to read about your problems as experienced as you are.
