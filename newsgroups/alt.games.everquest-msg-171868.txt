Yes.  I have almost the exact same system specs and find Dawnshroud (a
popular place) to be unplayable.  My mouse starts moving extremely
slowly there (move it, wait 2 seconds, then it finally moves) and
framerate is terrible.  Zoning back into Netherbian fixes it.  Haven't
tried Grimling yet but sounds like another zone to avoid.
