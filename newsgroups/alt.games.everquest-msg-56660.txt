I remember back when D&D first came out and I had seen some fumble dice
sold. I have never seen any since then. I regret now not getting one. 1d6
for when you rolled a 1 on a roll dealing with combat. On each side there
was something like: sword breaks, stub your toe, knock yourself out, or even
hit a groupmate if I am not mistaken. I wish I had more people where I live
who play the paper based RPGs.
