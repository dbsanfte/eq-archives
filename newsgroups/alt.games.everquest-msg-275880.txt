I've seen it happen, but I doubt it could happen here with the number of 
people posting on-topic messages daily.  In order for the signal/noise ratio 
to hit a point where active posters will leave because the newsgroup's a 
waste of time due to the crap, the invaders would have to be absurdly active 
in a group like this, either an enormous concerted effort on the part of a 
large group, or, more likely, rampant spamming that most news servers would 
be able to handle before regular readers would even see them.

I was in an alt group that had 5-6 regular posters, and we were deluged by 
about twenty invaders from another group, and they were hostile, insulting 
to the on-topic discussions and very prolific.  Since there weren't many 
regulars to post regularly to raise the signal/noise ratio, people just 
stopped bothering to come to the group to try to find the on-topic stuff, 
especially when people attempting to have on-topic discussions would often 
face the insults and harrassment of the invaders.

Then someone posted a request for help at NANAU, which brought all the kooks 
and trolls from there into the newsgroup, and the signal/noise ratio of the 
group shot to, I kid you not, 1 on-topic post per about 2500 off topic, 
extremely hostile and disruptive posts.  The group, both that month and the 
following month *each*, had more posts made to it than it had the previous 
ten years combined, which included the spam messages that Deja News/Google 
Groups had archived those years.

The group hasn't recovered from that incident, which took place about six 
years ago.  Nowadays we have maybe one on-topic thread that lasts more than 
three messages every ten months or so.

That's how you can destroy a newsgroup.  But with the number of regular 
posters reading this group, that sort of thing would be extremely difficult 
to pull off here.
