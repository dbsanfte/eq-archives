That's the "normal" hit from any given weapon.  If you look at your hits, 
you should see the preponderance of them at that value for a nonmelee 
class, or for melee class offhand weapons.  For a melee class main hand 
weapon, use the second formula to give the "normal" hit.  It's just a 
more accurate representation of how much damage the weapon will do than 
using strictly the damage value.
