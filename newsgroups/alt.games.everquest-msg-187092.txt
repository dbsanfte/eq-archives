    Read right above. "I'm fully aware of what a ZEM means." That's your
quote. No, you didn't know what one was WITH REFERENCE TO EQ or else you'd
have never said "Why does DL have a ZEM?" ALL zones have a ZEM, as per the
definition of ZEM. Not the "what would someone that didn't know what a ZEM
is in EQ" definition, the relevant definition.

    Let's go back to your full original quote, since you seem to be dancing
around here.

"Except I was posting from the english version of zem, not a math
formula.

Given you were unclear enough to cause confusion and in the event
defend it with a math formula, calling people fools is extreme. Not
everyone is so interested in their character's numbers they work out
their exp gains to the last decimal place, you know."

    You are trying to defend the undefendable: that you didn't know what the
term ZEM meant with relation to EQ. You thought you knew, but you were
*wrong* and were called a fool for it (which was an overreaction, in my
opinion). In the above quote, you continue to try and defend your ignorance.
Note how you draw attention to how the OP's response included a "math
formula". Why does it matter what form his defense takes of his point, why
mention this? Well, it matters if the point of your response is to belittle
the form of his. Your second sentence, "Not everyone...", continues to
belittle the form of his response to you. Not the content, because at no
point do you say that this formula is incorrect, but that he knows such
minute, trivial details about the game. Attacking the form of the response,
and not the points it makes, is attacking the poster.
