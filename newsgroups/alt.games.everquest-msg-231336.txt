I've had mobs be too high level, or uncharmable, but never a straight
resist.

Dual wield is king, carry a bag of craploot 1 handers, anything works, even
skinning knives or polished steel ulaks. You can kill pet when done to get
em back if you havent looted any to replace them. As far as heals go, you've
got a perfectly suitable 1500 pt heal for 400 mana, get in there & tank that
70% slowed mob. I guarantee youll never have a problem keeping agro. If
youre not sure a mob can dual wield, use cajoling whispers to recon the mob
b4 you burn DC.

The few times I've charmed a pet mob I've gotten agro from the pet.

Never, as far as buffs go. Supposedly used to, but it was nerfed long ago.
