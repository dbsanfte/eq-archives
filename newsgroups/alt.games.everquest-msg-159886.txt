Well, think of it this way... You're in a raid, and you get crunched by Vox.
You respawn right next to her, but while the server was loading you in, the
SA got aggro.  You loot up, and are an additional tank now (or maybe you
were a rogue who didn't manage his aggro).  Just keep on sailing.

A bit different than a caster who has to memorize his spells again, and (at
least I think this is the way it used to be) isn't full mana.
