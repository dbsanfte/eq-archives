FYI, before when you were in a place like LOIO on Kunark, the various
cat mobs (sabertooth lionesses, lions, etc.) would /con "scowling,
ready to attack" but in fact would not attack you unless you attacked
them first.  Well, apparently since this last patch, the cats will now
aggro you, just like the goblins, Sarnaks, outlaw Iksar and skellies.

I heard some players mention this and went and checked for myself and
sure enough, a sabertooth tigress and tiger both aggroed me without my
hitting them first (both green to me).
