Amen man.  I was the same way.  I held up at 61.99 for a while until I
had a 62 spell to cast.  Well, I got a spell and hit 62.  For whatever
reason I decided to hit 63, I think it was because my peers were out
leveling me and I felt like a slacker.  Since I hit 63 I decided I may
as well hit 64, since in theory I could get a spectral parchment and get
a 64 spell to cast from the turn in.  So I decided I'd hit 64.99 until I
came across a 65 spell to cast.  Well, I am 64.99 and I have seen
exactly ONE spectral parchment drop.

Now doing 100% AA in 64 I have noticed that AA is actually slower in PoV
than it was at 61.  So my advice is to get X.99 of whatever level you
currently are and stay there until you have a spell to cast above your
level.

PS Fuck you Verant for not making spectral parchments drop outside of
HoH with any frequency.
