Have seen an increase in the number of mobs standing at random points after
being dragged away from their spawns, but can't pin in down to the last
patch or the one before.

Seen this in PoJ for example with enforcers or punishers being left at
random points throughout PoJ by people training them away.  Some just
refuse to return to their spawn while others do so.

Probably a pathing/collision bug, I'll make sure to /bug each of them I see
now in case it's something major.

It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're saying.
