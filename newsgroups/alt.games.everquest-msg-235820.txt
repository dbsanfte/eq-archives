In order to be able to travel freely with a dark elf you will have to do 
a LOT of work.  I would recommend creating your character if you want 
it, but then creating a series of alts from different races to allow you 
to explore areas that your dark elf can't.  Trying to improve your 
faction for all good cities in the game will not be an easy task.
