The higher level you are, the easier it is to earn AAXP.  Therefore,
unless there's a particular ability you really want, it's most
efficient not doing any AAXP until 65.  One exception is Naggy and
Vox raids -- these have a level cap of 52, so if you're interested
turn on 100% AAXP when you're close to dinging 53.

As for percentage, there's really no reason to do anything but 100%
regular exp or 100% aaxp.  Going 50/50 is the worst; that just
makes it take the longest possible time to actually ding a level
or an AAXP.
