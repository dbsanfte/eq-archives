which he then quoted in full with no comments.

I don't mind the "zzz...zzz" part, although I like to read posts like
this to see how other people react to the game, and I figured some
people might be interested in the same from me, obviously not everyone
wants the same thing from this newsgroup.

If the vast majority came on and said "never post like that again" I
might listen, or I might point out that a killfile is easy enough to
build.  If not, well, still, its fair comment to let your tastes be
known.

But top posting, and quoting a long post with no direct comments on
it?  Those are crimes against not my sniveling little post, but against
AGE and usenet and the bandwidth of the Internet itself, and you'll
answer to Al Gore for them!
