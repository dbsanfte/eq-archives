Absolutely, it's kind of like camping.  But for me I have almost
laughed my drink out my nose on some of the party wipes.  And the 3 or
4 subsequent deaths on the CR have also made me cry with laughter on
occassion.

Case in point.  Group in CoM.  Chanter friend logs on drunk, RL not
game.  He is hanging at bridge when I call for RUN, he ducks and hangs
out.  Being the Paladin I stay to the bitter end so all party members
get out alive.  But he's just doing a duckwalk between walls.  Dead.
I make it out after that and come back to rez him.  As he's looting
his corpse a train comes by, dead again.  You had to be there but I'm
laughing as I type remembering the visual and subsequent group say's
afterwards.

Yea I know, humor at someone else's expense.  But that's what humor is
anyway.  Besides, when it happens to me I laugh just as hard.

It's watching your mage go from 100 to 13 in a second and knowing
there's jack you can do to keep him alive, but laughing because you
know it's "game over man!" .It's getting beat down so fast you stand
up just in time to see "Loading, Please wait...".

Maybe I'm odd in enjoying those situations but the game is just damn
fun, in alot of aspects.
