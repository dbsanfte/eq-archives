   She needs to kill lots and lots of things, to get experience to level
up!

  I don't think that necros are that hard to play, I managed to get one
up in the high twenties (a human!) with minimal gear and not too much
know how.  Just don't sink everything into wisdom gear and you'll be
fine.

And welcome back.  And what's your home server?  Test?
