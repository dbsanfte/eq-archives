>Monk either uses his bare hands or a Bronze Mace.

OK, if memory serves your monks hands are 4/36 at level 10 (maybe
5/36). 

If you have your heart set on getting a weapon, then look for anything
lightweight with a better delay (that you can afford). Some of the
newer Katars and knuckles have pretty decent delays so keep your eyes
open for a good deal. I have seen knuckles drop in Blackburrow and
East/West Commonlands (if you have a human monk) off of gnolls and
orcs around your level. Look for mobs holding a 3 bladed claw.

To be honest you can fight barehanded all the way to level 60, but it
is true that most 1hB weapons will hit harder and faster.

>I want him to be hunting wisps soon, so a magic weapon would be nice.

See if you can get a pair of Netted or Mesh gloves. They are
light-weight and magical.

You can also look into doing the Gem Inlaid Gauntlet's quest (with
your Druid) It requires a lot of running around (Qeynos, Freeport,
Butcherblock, South Karana), but the quest is easy. You need to loot 4
scrolls from the gnolls outside of Split Paw in South Karana. You are
probably too low to fight there yourself, but most people let the
scrolls rot. So you could probably trade SoW for loot rights.

SK is also a good place to hunt with your 19 Druid for EXP.
