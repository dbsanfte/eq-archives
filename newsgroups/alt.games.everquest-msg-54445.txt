BoF hits 4 targets.  Hence the name Quad-Kiting and not
Tri-kiting.....however at lvl 29 it takes alot of mana (relatively) and gets
resisted often...also there are not too many mobs at that lvl that are good
to quad....i suggest waiting until 34, and you get your new AE pillar spell
Circle of Force.  Having said all that though you can full speed quad (no
BoF) at many places from 16 upwards.  I did and went from 16 to 29 in two
days.  i was getting a little under 1 yellow bub of exp per pull.
