Have you tried customer support?

Do you know anyone else who plays eq?

I personally don't see any real harm in giving you keyless isos... but 
I'm not going to send you 4 or so cds worth either.

Other than that you can always pickup a copy of evolutions... a chance 
to two box or get a friend started, plus you get the images you need, 
and for 30 bucks its not that big an expense.
