The server is the master control of everything in the game.
You wouldn't have got anything if the server didn't give it to you.
Your machine and your friends machine are not connected directly
to each other, EXCEPT through the server. All data flows through
the servers at Verant.

If you equip the sword your buddy handed to you I would see
it on my machine as well, so I got the data that you now have the sword
somehow right? Even if I am on the other side of the planet.

Saves save data on the server not your machine.
