 Or their gimps. That's who I'm equipping. Maybe selling a piece or two
in the bazaar if I can. Personally there's no piece I would wear on my
primary although the legs wouldn't be bad. Stamina buff from Velious

Although it's hard to resist selling them since they're bringing in a
pretty good price still..
