Ditto on this sentiment.  I own a Dell that uses RDRAM.  Upgrading costs 2-3
times as much as DDR and there are very few sources for memory.  In
addition, only a couple of major manufacturers are using RDRAM, and even
then, only on select systems. Although DDR memory isn't quite as fast as
RDRAM, it wins hands down on the value proposition,which is why RDRAM is
fading quickly out of the picture.

I'd switch to a DDR platform if I could... but that's just my experience.
If you're going to stick with the RDRAM platform, you may want to pay Dell
now for the upgrade to 1G (esp. if they're having a deal of somesort on it),
just to buy yourself the peace of mind that you've got some extra capacity.

Good luck with the new PC
