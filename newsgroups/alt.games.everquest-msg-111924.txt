    Amazingly enough, within the past couple of days one person on one
server got a complete VT key. Someone else also posted within the past two
days a "proof" using EQmu that the zone didn't have the proper models in it,
but I'm not sure I trust that. Fancy how coincidental it is, someone
entering the zone for the first time being followed quickly by a patch to
the zone. :-/
