Well since thurgadin gate potions always gate you back to thurgain
you can have as many of those as you want.  Unfired vials are not
lore so you can have a ton of those pre-mixed.  Then every time you
gate just run down to frundel and ask her for another velium purifier
and add in your components and shebang, new potion, endless supply.

I think the cost more than outweighs the convienience in this case.
And with PoP and thurgadin gate potions I can be anywhere except
western wastes in a matter of minutes.
