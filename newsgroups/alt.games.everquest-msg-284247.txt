A mob spawned just after midnight, which could be the AC, several other 
named mobs, or just a commonly named mob.
I farmed about 15 rings back in the day. Used the multiquests to fund my KEI

Not sure about that. I have a theory that it was on the same spawn table as 
the undead cyclops and a few other mobs which used to make a roun trip 
between the birdhouse, splitpaw, and a point near the hermits hut. (similar 
to the "a drake"/hasten/"a grizzly bear" spawn in rathe mountains)

Perhaps someone else here will spill the beans.
