I am sort of wondering why thre SupHeal over Remedy for a patch heal.

Remedy - 170 mana, cast time 3    heals max 438 at 60
SupHeal  250 mana, cast time 4.5  heals max 583 at 40

About the only thing going for SupHeal is the amount of heal. If 
I need a fast patch, I will go for remedy as seconds *do* count, 
and the lower mana cost is nice. If I am not in a hurry [like 
PLing a lower character of mine] then I would go for SupHeal.

I love Pure Blood!!!
I have not really noticed any better undead nuking using the 
undead line of spells, I do a real slow root/rot with the undead 
DOT if I am soloing  undead. Otherwise I stick with Judgement. I 
normally don't nuke in LDoNs, I will send in Poofy the 
WonderHammer [I have ornate legs and can clicky it to save mana] 
and wade in pounding away if the others arent getting too much 
damage. If they start taking serious damage I go back to healing.

I am OK with Yaulp5, and use my donals bracer for pacing ig the 
mobs are under 55, and wake of tranquility if they are over 55. I 
like the level 5 stun and the level 9 root, they go of fast and 
dont tend to bet interfered with by the mobs pounding, they 
channel fairly well.

In general, I will root a mob and back out of agro range until 
someone tanks it or otherwise controls it, unless I need to keep 
it locked down.
