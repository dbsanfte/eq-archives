|The Sims were the #1 selling game last year.

	And how many of those people are still playing it?  How many copies, like
mine, are sitting on a shelf?

	I'm in Sims Online.  Half the properties I frequented have gone dark, IE,
they don't seem to ever be online any more.  (You can only enter a property if
the owner or a roommate is present.)  At least one changed owners and
susquently disappeared entirely.  And the only reason I didn't cancel the
account before the free month elapsed was because you can't cancel from the
web page, you have to make a phone call and I haven't had the time.
