Hi:

Many moons ago a fellow EQ player and friend sent me a graphic that showed a
fake EQ item she had made, it was a potion. Sadly though I've forgotten the
Website that allowed you to make up fake items and save the item as a
graphic, can anyone remember what the Site was called, and if so, post the
link? I'd be very grateful indeed.

Many thanks, and safe hunting to all ..

Stevie.
