Take four Ulthork tusks (rare drop of the ulthorks) to Cobalt Scar, and turn
them in to one of the Othmir (the chief I think), and get rewarded with a
random gem, can be a velious quest gem, a valuable gem of another type, or,
a practically worthless gem.  Soloing Ulthorks, it usually takes me several
hours at least to get four of the tusks.  If you are hunting them for xp
anyway, then, at least you are getting the xp while you are trying to get
the tusks.  If you hit the ones in the northwest part of the zone, they are
higher level, and will likely still be blue to you.
