There is a HUGE difference!

I just "downgraded" my wife's PC from ME to Win98SE last night,
because her favorite FTP program would not work in ME.

EQ runs at least 30% faster under Win98SE!!

She can now run SoL with 32bit color, high detail textures, Mip
Mapping, Dynamic Lights, and with 2xFSAA on a VooDoo5 at 800x600. Even
a "stutter" zone like West Free Port is almost perfectly smooth.

 Under ME she had to run med textures and disable mip mapping and
dynamic lights. West Freeport was a slide show.

All drivers and apps are the same. The only difference is the OS

Athlon 900
512mb PC133
Shuttle AK11 (Via KT133A chipset)
Via onboard sound
VooDoo 5 64mb (x3dfx 1.08.04 DX8 driver)
NetGear NIC (on a cable modem)
Win98SE
Via4in1 4.37
Via AGP 4.10
DX8.1
