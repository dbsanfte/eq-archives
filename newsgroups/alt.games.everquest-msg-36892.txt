Whose point should I stick to?  Your point?  My point?  One is more
valid than another?  How about you stick to my point and answer my
question.  Do the graphics of monsters distract you from watching the
numbers or not?   Would a wholly numeric display which reacted to your
button pressing be superior to the current EQ in that CPU and video
resources would not be wasted on silly content, leaving more raw power
for processing even more numbers?  

I know in your world the way you play makes perfect sense, but you do
have to understand that there is more than one world out there.  The
folks on my world are just curious about how the folks on your world
tick.  In order for the next generation of gaming to come into existence
as I see it, with games niche marketed such that those of your ilk are
not forced to play with folks such as myself and vice versa, the first
step requires understanding of both play styles.  My point is to uncover
just what sort of game appeals to powergamers so a perfect game can be
created for them, allowing me to play something else without them.  

See I prove what I'm made of in the real world and really would rather
play games for fun.  Not the fun of watching numbers get bigger, heck
I'd play AO if that's what I wanted, your numbers can really fly in that
game and there are a lot more of them too, some in pretty colors.  No I
mean real fun and numbers can only get in the way of that.

So anyway, back to my point:  Is non numeric content really just getting
in the way?
