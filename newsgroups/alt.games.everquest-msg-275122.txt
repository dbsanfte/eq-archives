Like I said the system wasnt perfect but it was getting better. SoE needed 
to tweak a few classes and it was set. Instead they totally changed the 
game.

So from what I can gather pretty much everyone can make anything. So it is 
now possible for the likes of Sages to level through making carbon spikes 
etc. What's the point of the class system if you can simply make anything 
you want.

Are SoE now going to get rid of interdependency for adventurers? After all 
i'm a Ranger why shouldnt I be allow to cast spells like a mage? It's not 
fair that I can't heal myself, why can't I do everything with one character?

For what it's worth it seems SoE have now clarrified the situation and it's 
not as bad as the inital post suggested. However I would still like to now 
see them fix the alchemist class and actually make their potions/poisons 
useful.

Nobody is going to pay 1g for a power increase that doesn't work and only 
lasts 3minutes.
