My 26 druid (well, now 27) has raised up 45 wisdom between getting
items from the events, and trading off items he replaced with drops
in order to get more wis gear.

Sure, the stuff isn't exactly uber to someone in their 50s, but none of
the events are filled with mobs in the 50s either.  Good solid gear for
anyone under 50 who isn't the recipient of some uber twinking on a
serious basis, though.

My 52 cleric ditched one of his forest loops for a pixie rib, and his
reed belt for the event belt too, and would like to pick up the shawl
and the doll in case he needs resist wear.
