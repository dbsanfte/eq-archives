ok peeps heres my issue (no im not going to cry i have a lawsuit) 8-) i had
a 46 druid a 41 ranger and an 18 cleric i busted my arse on for almost 2
years allon Bertoxxulous well they ended up losing all my characters when i
took a break from the game for 2 months (limit is usually 3) so i calmly
sent a petition to the lead GM of the server i got the usual i willl look
into it a week went by i heard nothing i e mailed him, ignored 3 days went
by time to e mail EQCS they had another GM look into it not a trace of the
characters they tried to blame me for it ok starting to get angry was told
to re e mail the lead GM i did so no reply petition again get supervisors e
mail i e mail him hmmm no response how surprising petition again we are
checking archived backup files (i find out they dont exist from someone
else) finally after a week and a half supervisor e mails me "please refer
all concerns to the lead GM" ARRRRGH ok starting to get REALLY angry i re e
mail him no response again i file a complaint with EQCS and the lead
supervisor of all the EQ GMs supervisor of the lead GM of bertox replies
fast enough "we are unable to restore your characters this matter is now
closed" i explode i try to complain to the proper channels lead GM
supervisor intercepts all complaints and tells everyone matter is resolved
ok now i no longer have a character by the fault of Verant Entertainment if
you are on Bertoxxulous be VERY wary you may end up getting screwed over i
am a player that is concerned for others is all thank you for listening to
my ranting
