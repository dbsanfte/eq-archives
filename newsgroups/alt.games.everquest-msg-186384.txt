Jekke,
When did you start seeing drops that are worth around 10k?  What level
did that start for you?  Did it start at 50?  My highest is a 42 bard.
 There are items in the Bazaar that used to be worth a few thousand
plat but now are only worth 200pp at the most.

I'm asking cause I'm tired of having 200pp at most on my main.  When
my bard was level 2 I used to think "I should have at least 5k in the
bank by level 40."  Maybe I should stop spending it as I earn it.  :o)
