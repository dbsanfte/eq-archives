Ok, all of those tasks Cost more than mana... The Necro Rez is rather
PP expensive, and the Symbol adds up... oh and the Porting druid, well
it takes more time.  
Now, a Wizard can xloc, and Yeah id think it part of his duty to xloc
someone from the group when they are leaving... Id be agast if they
refused to.  Just as I would if a Cleric refused to res someone.

Exactly, and if you take the stance that the Cleric (also commonly
known as the Rezer...) has no duty to the group to res... well you are
not using common sense.
