>>> er, being that they are two different games and Shadowbane hasn't
even been
released I don't see how you can possibly assume that it won't work.
Did you
consider that they are two different systems designed by two different
groups? One's failings need not be anothers and there is no way for
you to
tell that until it's released. <<<

Being a different game doesn't mean that old design techniques will
work any better than they did before. No, I haven't played Shadowbane,
but when people tell me that player-run guilds will have the time and
inclination to manage a database of who killed who, and that this is
enough to prevent grief players, I've seen that philosophy before, and
it didn't work. Hopefully the designers are better than that. I guess
we'll see.
