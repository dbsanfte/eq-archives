Let's run the numbers, shall we?

Heroism costs 140 mana, but lasts for 72 minutes and increases
the tank's max hitpoints by about 380.

For a typical situation, let's say your tank has 3000 HP normally,
and you generally get a CHeal off when he's down to about 600
HP (one bubble).

Without Heroism, each CHeal is healing 3000-600=2400 HP for 400
mana, or 6 HP/mana point.

With Heroism, if you still get off a CHeal when the tank is
down to 600, each CHeal is healing 3380-600=2780 HP for 400
mana, or 6.95 HP/mana point.

Heroism makes your CHeal even more mana-efficient (16% more,
in this example).

But wait, there's more.

Because your tank has more max HP, it takes longer for him
to drop to 600 HP each time, meaning that you have to CHeal
*less often* if he has Heroism on (even leaving aside the
damage he doesn't take because he has 20 more AC thanks
to the Heroism).

Dusting off my high school algebra, we can express the
break-even point for casting Heroism once (for 140 mana)
in terms of "N", where "N" = how much total HP you
need to CHeal your tank (total) before
the buff wears off:

   N / 2400 * 400 - N / 2780 * 400 = 140

[Explanation:  N/2400 = how many CHeals you'll
               need to heal "N" hitpoints without
               Heroism

               N/2780 = how many CHeals you'll need
               to heal "N" hitpoints with Heroism

               "* 400" to convert each expression to
               how much mana you'll need to expend in
               each situation casting those CHeals.
 
               Subtract to find out how much mana
               you've saved using Heroism versus not.

               Set equal to 140, to find the point where
               the amount you've saved equals the cost
               of casting the Heroism buff in the
               first place.]

Solving for "N", we get 6145 HP.

In other words, if you need to CHeal your tank for
6145 HP, *total*, over SEVENTY-TWO MINUTES,
the 140 mana cost of Heroism has paid for itself by
virtue of making each of your CHeals more mana efficient,
*and* making you need to cast CHeal somewhat less often.
This is only about two CHeals, I *hope* you're doing
more fighting than that over 72 minutes...

If your tank takes *more* than 6145 HP in 72 minutes,
the mana cost of Heroism greatly pays for itself.

For example, if you normally need to CHeal your tank
roughly every 72 seconds (which isn't unusual at a camp
with fast pulls), that would be 2400*60 = 144,000HP
healing over 72 minutes.  Mana cost without Heroism
would be 24,000 (60 Cheals at 400 mana a pop).

*With* Heroism, you'd only have to heal him 144,000/2780 =
51.8 times, for a mana cost of 51.8*400 = 20,720 mana.
Adding in the cost of initially buffing the tank
with Heroism in the first place changes that to
20,720 + 140 = 20,860.

Let's see...  Total of 24,000 mana over 72 minutes if you
blow off Heroism, total of 20,860 mana over 72 minutes if
you do cast Heroism...

Or put another way, by spending 140 mana to cast
Heroism on your main tank, you save 3140 mana over
the next 72 minutes.  How much butt-sitting time is that?

In your own words, "You tell me which is more efficient"...


>Personally, I'd rather save the mana, but tanks don't like that :)

"As a tank", let me say that the reason they don't like it
is perhaps because they understand your job better than you do.

I'll bet you consider the Symbol line a waste of mana too...
