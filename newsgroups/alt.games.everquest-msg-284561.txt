	Hmmm, ok, root, that I see.  Clerics stuns I don't consider
terribly useful due to the very long recast time - you get one per
fight.  Nuke?  :-)  Well, ok, DPS is DPS, but IMHO cleric nukes have
such a high resist rate, low damage, and long cast that it makes me
not want to bother...

	Cleric melee is fun but is the dps significant?  Even with
the hammer I see "Monk hits mob for 500 (x4)...Rogue backstabs for
2000..Ranger hits mob for 4500 non melee damage" and it still takes
a long time to die, so does that 1-2K really matter?

	I'm asking if this is a correct view not arguing with yours.
