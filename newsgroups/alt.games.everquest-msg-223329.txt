I've been trying to find a game that's right for my style. I'm hoping EQ2
will be but in the meanwhile I was hoping people might know of something
that met the following criterion:

1) Casual/solo gamer friendly as sometimes i have to go offline suddenly or
go away for weeks on end
2) Not automatically PVP ... The SWG system of making you neutral to
everyone until proven otherwise was nice
3) fun!

Can anyone think of any? I tried EQ, SWG, second life, and a few others ...
EQ was great at low level but the end game is not solo friendly and I was
never able to get involved in raids etc with my real workld commitments.

SWG was terrific in some ways but if you go offline for long, your house etc
is destroyed and starting from scratch again is not much fun, and having to
run everywhere was stupid.
