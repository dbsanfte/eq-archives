I assume this badly clipped and accredited rant was directed at me?

The "pile of corpses" that you refer to took up, without any floor space
showing, the entire side of Shadow Haven that the soulbinder is on.
I challenge you to show ANY machine that can handle many hundreds, if
not thousands of corpses tightly packed like that.

People do things to grief, and get reported.
People do things by accident that cause grief. They get reported.

In either case, it is to have a GM remove the problem involved, be it
the person or the result of an accident.
So where, exactly, is your problem? Someone uncover your favorite
griefing trick? Or perhaps your knee jerked uncontrollably before you
could think it through?
