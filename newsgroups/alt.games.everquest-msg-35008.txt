Uh-huh, well actually Christianity hi-jacked an existing pagan festival
for Christmas. Pope Julius I chose a seemingly arbitrary date for
Christ's birth, December 25th, ignoring evidence as to the actual date.
By sheer coincidence I'm sure, this enabled the church to fit its
festival in with existing celebrations for Winter Solstice, Saturnalia,
the feast in honour of Mithras the sun god, etc.
