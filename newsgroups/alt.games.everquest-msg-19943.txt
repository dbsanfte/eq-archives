I just bought this game a week ago, and I'm getting VERY dicouraged. I play
a lot of online games, and I know when you start late there is going to be a
learning curve. But I am fed up with people snubing me because I'm new, and
have nothing to offer them, or because I don't understand the acronyms yet.
(BTW, what the HELL is SoW?) I understand you need to make a profit for your
time, but c'mon!

Two days ago, I accidentally wandered into a badit camp, and was killed
instantly. I ran into 3 different warriors that were more than a match for
the bandits, and flat refused to help me get what little I had without a
bounty. WHAT A JOKE! I had, maybe, 4 GP to my name, no arrmor, a sword
someone left behind, some food, and some stuff I needed to sell. It's not
much to most of you, but I worked damn hard for that crap. So it saddens me
to say, I deleted the character. He was only a level 4 Rouge, but man, what
a waist of time. If this game continues to play like this, I'm out!
