Well I played EQ2, got a brawler up to 25, then WoW came out. I bough WoW 
since I could not get my wife interested in playing EQ2 and figured I would 
play WoW a night or two a week and continue with EQ2.

I cancelled my EQ2 account, and play WoW when ever I can find the extra 
time..............

EQ2 was awesome (still is), had great graphics (I have a good machine so did 
not have any issues), decent quests, pretty easy to get a group etc. 
Tradeskills blew but that is my opinion and with the economics settling down 
may alleviate at least some of the issues I had. But overall a fun game. 
Note, I had no issues soloing even at 25, I could take 2up arrow white mobs, 
and groups of white mobs if I planned my moves correctly, lots of times it 
was close, but possible.

WoW (IMHO) is just better. The quests are excellent, you can share with 
people in your group so everyone can work toward the same goal. Grouping is 
fun (though I would like it to allow for 6 people not the 5), and soloing is 
possible. I have a 30 hunter (solos very well) and a 25 paladin (solos 
pretty well), the paladin most of the time is grouped with my wife's 
paladin, this is actually a great duo.

Why is WoW better? Not sure, I just have more fun, the graphics and 
everything being a little cartoonish add to this I am sure, the lack of 
zoning REALLY adds to this, and the fact that I can do tradeskills (as a 
secondary thing, not having to read the web to figure out what the best 
combo of "effects" makes the chance for a pristine combine easier, etc) adds 
a little something. EQ2 feels more like a grind (since zoning is a perceived 
timesink).
