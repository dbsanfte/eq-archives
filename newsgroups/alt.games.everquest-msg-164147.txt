 Then perhaps PoP isn't for you. Verant/Sony said from day one than PoP
was primarily geared towards the raiding guilds although a few zones
would be usable by anyone. Apparently you didn't believe them.

 Yeah right is correct. You think someone gimping in and looting the
mark off a mob they took no part in killing isn't an exploit? Please
book me a plane ticket to wherever you're living because I'd like to
take a vacation to that fantasy land.

 And comparing PoV to Ssra isn't accurate. The mobs in PoV (and higher
planes) are higher level than Ssra mobs and most times hit for twice as
much. Why shouldn't the XP be better? But hey, you're the one leveling
not me. If you think the XP is too good go back to Ssra.

 Doesn't bother me. I left PoV a long time ago due to all the clueless
gimps populating the place. Despite what you think, Valor is not
'massive experience gathering'. There are zones with better XP than
Valor. So enjoy your stay!
