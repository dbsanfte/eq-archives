You don't have to give her 550 gold, either.  55 plat will work just fine. 
I've done it.

But you also don't need to go to Sol Ro Temple.  Fire Opals are a common
drop in Sebilis.  People tend to give them to the clerics so that they can
sell them to recoup the cost on peridots.  Generally, the clerics sell them
as soon as they can, which in Firiona Vie.  So check the merchants in FV,
you should be able to find one selling fire opals.  That's where I've found
most of the ones I've needed.
