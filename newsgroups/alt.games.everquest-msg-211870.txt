It's been a couple of months since I have done flies, but as a wizard
(Aallar, 61 - Prexus) I can say I have never run into this problem of mobs
shooting back up to 40% when fleeing, and I was very often if not almost
always (due to resists) left over with one mob in the end. I am curious what
the state of your final mob was like? snared/rooted/nothing? mine were
always snared, perhaps this is the difference?
