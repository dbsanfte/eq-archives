One word: LDON. A competent chanter can always get into a LDoN group, they
are highly desired. Start doing LDON adventures and it won't take you any
whole months to get one level ever again.

In a different way, druids are also very well suited to LDoN groupage,
though that realization is still dawning on people who had gotten used to
seeing druids as a less-powerful class. But everybody doing LDoN adventures
wants a chanter, always.
