Are you level 56 or higher?  If so, there is no weapon better than your
summoned hammer, because the damage you'll do with any weapon is limited by
your low skill cap; you'll be missing a lot more than you hit, and the
situation only gets worse the more you level up and fight harder mobs.
However the 56+ summoned hammers (awsome weapons in their own right, if only
our skills weren't capped) proc an unresistable DD, and do so at a decent
rate, such that the damage you do from procs will be more than what you do via
weapon damage with any weapon I can think of.  Further, the weapon has a +25
dex on it, and using Yaulp V (which you should if you want to melee, as it
gives you 10 mana per tic, making up to some extent for missing out on
meditation) gives you another +75 dex; this adds to the already high proc
rate.

If you want to gear up as a melee cleric from that stage on, the key is in
getting your dex up even further, push it right to the cieling, and with AA at
61+, you can raise that cieling, which is a good idea.  Higher dex (and I mean
much higher, one or two points isn't going to make any difference) means more
procs, and procs are 90% of your damage output.  Get the shaman to dex buff
you, its worthwhile if you are meleeing.

Now for the bad news, on most mobs, even warriors (worst damage output of any
melee class) will still outdamage you; from 56 to 60 you may be competitive if
they dont' have great gear, but after that point they'll just leave you in the
dust.  The only case where you'll outdamage them in melee are those where the
mob has incredibly high damage mitigation or special damage rules; for example
there is a mob in Tenebrous Mountains that can only be hit by Vampire Bane
weapons; now your melee aren't able to use their Super Uber Slicer and Dicer
from the Plane of Kitchenware; they have to get wooden stakes or something;
you keep slugging with your summoned weapon (which does no damage as the
target is immune) and the procs do just as much as they ever did.
