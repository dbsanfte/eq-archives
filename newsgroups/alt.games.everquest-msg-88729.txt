While many people tend to underrate it for the late forties, I'll still
say you could give EJ a whirl. I'm *STILL* finding blue stuff there
regularly at 54 when I pass through. Hunt at the TT zone and pull to
there in case of trouble. I've seen druids kiting up and down along that
wall next to the TT zone before. Easy meat. No loot, but no competitoin
either. EJ is usually deserted. No clue why. I did several levels there
extrememly easily.
