Anyone know if there is a way to change the size, shape, color, etc of
the EQ cursor? I have looked ant the .INI configuration, and I cant
seem to find anything, if there is anything,

I specifically would like to have a larger cursor, sometime in melee's
it's a liottle hard to spot the standart cursor

Incidently, changing the Windows Cursor Size has no effect on EQ. 

Thanks for any help
