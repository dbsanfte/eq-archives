It is cool so far. Though I am an evil and STUCK in Paineel untill I manage
to level up one more time for invis =)

I have been to the sewers a few times...

Its cool I found an AWESOME evil guild, www.shadowguard.org

I killed my first goodie a few nights ago it was fun. He was a enchanter.
Mezzed me once for awhile after I dotted him with disease, posion, and
darkness. After it wore off he was about to die from it and was walking
about I drained him. It was fun! Did it while defending the newbies/lowbies
(which I am one =p) and got 8gp outta it.
