From the shadows, the mysterious 42 <user@example.net> (if that IS his
real name) conspiratorially whispered:

That was my judgement as well, except its awfully long for trolling -
probably drove off a lot of potential bait simply because people can't
be bothered to read drivel that lengthy.

He's reinforcing that judgement with his replies, however. I guess he
was just really *really* bored, bored enough to both write that essay
and then spend the next several hours here hitting download new
headers every five minutes to see what replies he's managed to get.

Either way, troll or honest post, I don't think we've had a more
pathetic excuse for a human crawl in *here* in a while.

As I said, "pathetic" describes it whether or not it was a troll. :-)

The poster has no usenet history, though, and yet came straight here
with his story. It reeks of sockpuppet. Any coward can troll
anonymously, only real trolls can do it while maintaining a steady
identity. This is an amateur.
