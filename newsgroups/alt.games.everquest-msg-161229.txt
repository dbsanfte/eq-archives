Been having this problem for a few months now, but normally it goes away for
weeks at a time and then suddenly surges back.  It happens at no particular
time (I work really odd shifts, so I'm on at different times throughout the
week and even different week to week) and on no particular day.  In other
words, doesn't seem to be related to network traffic since I've had the
problem at 3am on a Tuesday night.

Okay, this is what happens.  Everything is going fine when all of a sudden
my lag meter starts popping.  I don't get lag spikes, the two central
numbers stay at 0% and the number on the left (ping rate, right?) stays
where it normally does.  But the number on the right jumps up to around 3500
and even higher whereas it normally sticks between 200 and 1000 or so.  And
the little green meter under it starts moving at I'd say about level 60
Selo's speed.  As a result, everything I do is delayed.  If I cast a spell
it will take anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute or more between the
casting bar finishing out and actually seeing, "You begin casting...." and
then the normal delay for the spell and then it goes off.  (this is an
extremely bad thing since I play a cleric as my main)  When I send a tell,
it won't show up on screen until after the same delay.  Group messages are
also delayed, judging by people's reaction times to what I say.  Even when I
log off there is the same delay between the end of the last 5 seconds and
actually going back to the character selection screen.  Moving around is
okay, if a little clipped, but when I try and melee with one of my alts,
when the mob starts fleeing I get the too far away or you can't see your
target messages, so it seems to be placing me on the map at a different spot
than what is apparent to me.

I have contacted tech support and all I got back was a direct quote from the
FAQ I already read.  After a response again saying I did NOT have a firewall
up and running (yes I have it disabled within XP) and had tried everything
else they had recommended (including playing around with my Datarate.txt
file placing it anywhere from 3 up to 9 with no effect) and various other
info I got an email back telling me to turn off any firewall software I had
running and to not do all the things I had already told them I was NOT
doing.  At this point I basically gave up on tech support partly out of
frustration and also because the problem seemed to disappear for awhile.
Happened again tonight and figured I'd ask the people who actually know a
damn thing about this game (you guys) rather than the idiots in Tech Support
for Sony.

I have an Athlon 1800XP with 512MB DDRAM, GeForce 3 Ti500, SoundBlaster
Audigy Platinum (including the ever so useless remote control), 2 60 GB
HDD's and I'm playing on a Cable Modem.  I play with all models activated
and at the highest settings at 1280x1024 32bit Resolution and with Clip
Plane around 20%.  I have tried disabling all models and cutting out Spell
Effects, dropping clip plane to 5%, lowering details, turning the sky off,
turning NPC and PC names off, etc and still the same results.  I have the
latest drivers for every piece of hardware I have (trust me I'm all but
obsessive about this) and all the patches for XP, latest direct x (though I
haven't tried uninstalling and reinstalling this and I'm honestly not sure
how to do that with XP anyway).  I have deleted and repatched all the txc
files, all the xmi files and basically all the files that I could delete at
various times with the exception of the larger sound files since I had heard
there was a limit to the amount of info that EQ could patch.  I once even
tried totally uninstalling EQ and reinstalling to no effect.

I would post my Direct X diag file but that would make this post way too
long.  If anyone is actually adept at reading that humongous file, let me
know and I will post it as a follow up.

Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated because even as much of a
computer geek as I am, I am totally out of clues on this one.
