Well, PoV was nice at the start too.  It wont be all that long before other
tier guilds gain access to the next set of PoP zones.

Well maybe AD's chamber seems like a safer option, but after what happened
the other night, it showed me NOWHERE is safe from trains in that god
forsaken zone.

We were next to AD buffing prior to killing him (had got past the keyed area
and teleported down), had been down there about an hour actually getting
ready (2 zone crashes), when all of a sudden about 8 spiders burst onto the
scene and started killing any of our sitting casters

I dont use it as a buff/rezz location, but a lot of people do.

I dont know where the cave is, not sure about it being deliberate either..
its just a wipe open area away from KoS mobs that you can "safely" pull
to/kite in/solo.

Its on the zone wall, and I know a lot of people use the zonewall as their
guide to move around (and to agro as few mobs as possible)

That would take sense...  obvious flaw in why that wont work!

Hmm I didn't realise atone would make it uber regen up(although its obvious
thinking about it)..  I think I just found a new way to have some fun when
im bored and a kiter pisses me off :)  (of course I could just dispell their
mob)

Its not about being a "top" guild or not..  theres lots of guilds that can
kill big mobs, but are the biggest assholes, use the lamest tactics,
zergfests etc

And like I said at the top, new zones are nice, but they don't last
