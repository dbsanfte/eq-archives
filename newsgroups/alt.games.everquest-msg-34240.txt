The point is everytime you tattle on someone you find it neccesary to come
here and tell everyone all about it. Does anyone really give a crap that
your a whiny snivelling punk? (oh no /report ) You obviously keep your ass
clenched too tight all the time. I can imagine the gm's response to one of
your petitions...

GM Whogivesafuk ..Oh christ its the safety patrol guy again..wonder who
looked at him funny this time...

GM W... This is gm W what can we do for you...

Lokari... I have just sent you copies of the last two hours log where this
newbie called me names repeatedly and said that i was an anal retentive
fuckhead. I would like his account immediately banned for the below listed
violations of Sony's EULA and...
(10 minutes later)
...so to help you I have attached a txt file of the EULA and policies.

GM W... (yawn) Ok I will check into the matter and take appropriate actions.
(promptly deletes all the logs and txt files)

GM W to GM T... gods if that guy would devote as much energy to playing as
he does reporting every newb with a name he doesnt like or who calls him a
name he would be 60th by now. You would think someone who was so obsessed
with being IMMERSED in the game would spend less time /petitioning.

GM T .. hehe you must be referring to Lokari , he petitions so much we made
hot keys to answer him....

Petition every newbie you see, thats well within your rights. Just don't
waste bandwidth telling us how much of a lame ass childish punk you really
are.
