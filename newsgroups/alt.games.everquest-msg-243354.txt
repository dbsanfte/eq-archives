Obviously that's entirely up to you.  I'd say it depends on your
playing style.  If you're likely to need the less often used skills in
an emergency (or when you're not likely to be able to afford the mana
for lots of fizzles), then you may want to be prepared and use up
those training points on those skills.  If you spend a lot of time
hanging around PoK chatting to friends or waiting for people, then you
could use that time mindlessly casting spells on yourself or NPCs.
You cannot damage or aggro anything in PoK, but your skills will still
rise until they hit the cap.  

Alternatively buy a macroing keypad, such as a Nostromo, set up a
macro and leave yourself casting away through the night or day.  Now
that you can include /autoinv in a hotkey, you can even summon items
without having to worry about the items hanging on your cursor.  Not
that I would endorse such a thing, oh no.  :)
