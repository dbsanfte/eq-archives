hahahaha, i've played eq2 long enough that i have to ask a question or
two ... i think there's an eq2 group but i'm not going to bother, i've
posted here on and off for 7 years ^_^


i *love* my coercer (lvl 36 at the moment), as i'm sure you could
guess from the last post i made

however, in true eq-fashion, i figured i'd make an alt


i went with shadowknight, and i'm playing it with 2 RL friends who
started an inquisitor (cleric) and warlock (ae-focused wizard)

so we're a good little group, maybe ... i've not gotten to the high
end yet and so i'm not sure what's in store


what's a smart way to specialize the sk? aggro? defense?

what synergy "tricks," if any, exist for the sk? in eq1, sk+shaman
could go all the way together, sk+druid was also very good (the
lifetaps making up for the druid's worse healing), and cleric + any
tank was fine for just xp'ing

ex., how's sk+ warden? or fury?

how's it compare to sk+ templar/inquisitor?


and yes, i'll try looking at the eq2 forums on sony's board...
