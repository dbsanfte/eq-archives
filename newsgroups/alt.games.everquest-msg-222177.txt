Not much use?  Capped specialization is 10% cheaper casting cost
for all spells in that line (50 specialization is 2.5% savings,
by the way, for all other spells).

Thats the same as 10% more mana pool (because you can cast 10%
more spells for the same overall mana) PLUS 10% more mana regen
(because it takes 10% less time to regenerate the mana it cost
you to cast any given spell)

Stacks with FT, stacks with focus effects... someone who's
specialized in the skill he's casting all his spells in can cast
10% more per hour and 10% more at any given time if he has to
blow out all mana in a hurry.

Only person it won't matter for is someone who's consistently FM
most of the time, and never ever goes OOM in an emergency.  Sound
like any enchanter you know?
