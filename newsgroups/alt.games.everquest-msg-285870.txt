If you like MMOs hardcore and not full of level 60 gimpbois showing
off shiny mounts and armours then Vanguard may be right up your
street. It has its fair share of issues, but deep down inside is the
kind of MMO experience not seen since the early days of Everquest.
The world itself is absolutely beautiful, making you want to see more
and more of it. The different races starter areas all have very
distinct looks to them, too. The elves area is rich with trees, and
the reminisce of a once great empire, toppled statues and ruins
everywhere, whereas the dwarf area is strong fortresses, with
watchtowers and stationed guards all over the region. And the beauty
isn't just in the world design; the textures on just about everything
look great.
We know that you don't want to waste your time for the gold to perfect
equipments. We provide any help to make your purchase easy. Your
requirement is our duty. Have fun!!!
