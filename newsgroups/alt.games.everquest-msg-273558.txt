Well, I found starting with one bag to be just enough of an improvement
to facilitate practical inventory management. When you have to run back
to the bank or merchant every several minutes to avoid having to pass
over even the trivial loot you desperately need, it doesn't allow for
you to get very far at all from town or get started with much more
interesting than the rats at the city gates.

I remember a few harrowing trips across zones that I thoroughly enjoyed
as a very low level character.

I can probably count the number of times I had *any* trouble on a boat
on one hand, though I'll concede that the concept was far more sound
than the implementation by the mid to later expansions.

So you plan for it. You give the encounter a little more substance than
just popping up nearby, running in, killing something and running out. I
didn't normally have much trouble getting a bind when and where I needed
it though, and always made an effort to offer them when playing a
binding class.

True, I suppose. I had a VooDoo 3 card and never had any trouble, but I
can see how it would have been a problem for someone experiencing those
sort of problems. 

Still, I think the game was better off with night-blindness than without
even under those circumstances. If I *had* had that sort of trouble due
to my graphics card, I would likely have just played a race that didn't
suffer from it. /shrug
