Your "logic" is not taking into consideration the lexical definition of
Nigger, and why it is used. The fact that people use derogatory phrases
'amongst friends' is somehow lost by your reasoning. The Subject line of the
post is not a phrase used amongst friends. It is a public post. Your
so-called logic would imply that a subject line and a phrase used amongst
friends are identical. I shouldn't have to point out how stupid that is on
your part.
