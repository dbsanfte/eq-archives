the level + 5 is there to balance out exp at the lower levels and between
people whose levels differ to the extremeties of the range, and has a
negligable effect once you level up a bit.  I wrote some of the older
exp calculating code in showeq, and this (along with some other
things) were the cause for some error in the calculated numbers and
the authoritave data the server sent.  It still wasnt perfect, due to the
servers using more precise values for class and race modifiers than
we did.  I might also add that level + 5 wasnt my idea, but someone
who would know that would probably rather remain nameless, and
with his word plus the research i did into it, i can say it is the correct
methodology.
