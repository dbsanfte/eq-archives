Your bash is the same either way, its not dependant upon the shield
you have to bash with at all. As long as you ad some points into bash
when you can train it you can merrily use your slam key which is bash
even with a 2 hand slash.

The point of an ogre troll or barbarian is that you CAN still bash for
the full points without a shield and with your two hand weapon. Just
get your slam key and make a button over in the boxes on the left with
it so you can hit it during the fight (like 3 or wherever you put it)

My troll sk uses that slam key at level 32 and does a full damage bash
with a shield or with a 2 hand weapon, that is the intent and
advantage of the large races.
