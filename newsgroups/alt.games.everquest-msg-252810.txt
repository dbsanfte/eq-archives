Not in poarticular, except there seems to be less 'jumping' by
player characters, mine included. By that I mean I see less of a
character moving to a location, then suddenly popping back about a
hundred feet, then popping back to the location they just ran to.

I used f9 to place the camera view so I can look back at my
characters and I see smoother movement while traveling.
