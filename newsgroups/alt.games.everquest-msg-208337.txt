Well, we'd disagree that the only 'real' monks are the ones that raid,
but that's a matter of perspective. I'll freely admit that I was
referring only to exp groups where making it harder to pull with
Pacify/Harmony is a good thing, imo. There's way too many zones out
there where any idiot with a lull spell can pull better than even the
good monks and that isn't something I enjoy seeing.
