You probably dont need any . Im pretty sure that wizards can solo till 60
nude .

For soloing (your a wizard your going to be doing alot of this ) you want
the following most.
foot speed increaser

jboots (quest starting in rathe mountains . ask the speedy gnome what rare
trade )
tboots ( in the bowels of sol-A costs 5250 with good cha)
sow potions (10 charge sow potions go for 100-150pp)
begging for buffs ( works ok outside but annoys people , ask nicely and go
to them , try not to beg from shaman pets )

other than that. there is certain equipment you can get grouped or solo .
green silken drape (sol b grouped) similiar in crystal caverns
golden chitin bracers (sol b grouped )
molten cloak (sol a solo if your lucky )
gator or rathyl arms (upper guk or najena , solo if lucky)
velium sapphire necklace (bought from jeweler ) and other appropriate trade
made jewelry .

there are many other pieces you can get at your level but ill let others
fill them in. http://everquest.allakhazam.com/
is a good site.
