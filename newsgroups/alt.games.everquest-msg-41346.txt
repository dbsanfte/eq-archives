Sorry to jump into your discussion but wanted to say I think you've hit the
nail on the head there.  I for one can't see why the hell anyone needs to
know exactly how many people are on the servers.  I play on a 26-28k
conection and notice very little difference between my lag with 2500 people
online and 500.  But there seems like some people like just like to complain
and show their balls EVERY time Verant changes anything.  My personlal
favorite is all the whiners on chat whenever there is a SCHEDULED patch.
Never mind that anyone who reads the damn update texts or everquest.com
knows about the patch weeks in advance, to the dipshits who expect EQ to be
up every second of their otherwise empty lives it's "fuckin bullshit!" and
"fuck verant!" and "verant sux!1!"  They should have a "no patching ever"
server just for them, see how they like it if Verant stops "fucking with
stuff" and patching when they NEED to play.

And hows this for a bottom line:
It's a fucking game no one forces you to play it it you can't go on without
the server population fucking quit already!!!
