Tell me about it.  I'm fixing to go on a soloing spree with my alt rogue
now that she's epic'd, for one purpose:

Getting her defense skill up.

At level 51 her Defense skill still hasn't reached the level 40 cap.
That's embarrassing.

It's all about Evade.  I've been lucky enough with my alt rogue
to group constantly since level 20.  Constantly.  With a real
tank close by.  I get hit so rarely, that even when I do draw
aggro it's a VERY RARE situation that I won't just immediately
evade aggro back onto the tank.

So I need to solo.  Soloing at 51 against blue mobs will not
be fun, but I'm resigning myself to NOT worrying about it.  With
a Ceremonial Iksar BP and 2 points in AA regeneration so far,
I'm just going to start hitting stuff near a zone (DL--->KC is a good
place for this) and meleeing until I'm pretty close to dead
before zoning to bandage up and then sit to (thankfully faster)
regen to full.

I _need_ to get hit.  But a rogue's job is_not_ to get hit.
Conundrum...
:-)
