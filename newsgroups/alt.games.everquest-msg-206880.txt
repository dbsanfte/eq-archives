My first ever character was a Half Elf Rogue and over a year on he is only
24. I want to play him properly now and I made 2 levels in PC a few days ago
and am now in HHK.

Are there any tips you guys can give me (especially on good items to buy)? I
can twink him to a small degree so I'd be interested to hear of good combos.
ATM I am thinking of buying items that proc and I have the Mrylokar's
Vambraces that cast Strength of Earth (which I believe do so in my 30's). My
main weapon is a Sharpened Mandible Spear and my secondary is a Locustlure.
I got my Mask of Deception recently so I am also looking for a head slot
item that will look like a skull when I am in Dark Elf mode (Male Dark Elf
Rogue).

Thanks for any tips in advance.
