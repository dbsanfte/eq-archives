I'm sorry, I never was good at the metaphysical stuff, but what you just
wrote makes absolutely no sense.  How can science and religion exist "in a
different plane?"  Either science is true, or it isn't.  Either religion is
true, or is isn't, in whole, or in part.

As an aside, the mormons have an interesting doctrine that says that God
created the world by way of science, and that all of the miracles are just
advanced application of the natural laws that He created.  "I exclude not
myself."  So, from a mormon standpoint, science and religion must coincide,
since God is the architect, and science is the tool.
