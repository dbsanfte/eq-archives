    Thought I saw it on Graffe's, home of the most obsessive mana-watchers
in the game. Discussion on the wizard who was claiming 100 DPS by
alternating Solist's with his Rend robe while on horseback, with bard song,
with all the ENCH mana accelerators, etc.

    Without mana acceleration of any sort? Most wizards report 10 minute or
greater refill times from OOM to FM, which is roughly what you're seeing.
Even my 60 cleric with low plus MANA and 183 WIS takes close to two minutes
per bub of mana unassisted. If it were 26/tick, then I'd hazard a guess at
mana regen rate being given by the formula (Meditation/10 + X) per tick,
with the sitting (and not medding, so pre-35) rate being the same as the HP
regen rate for a non-regen race.
