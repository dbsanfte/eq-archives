...assuming that pushing their system hard enough would cause the LCD to 
operate beyond its capabilities.  My gaming machine has a P-III 1000E, 
256MB RAM, and ATI Radeon 7200 running Win98SE, and the LCD looks 
terrific for games.  Now if I had a higher spec system, say a 2+ Ghz 
with a Geforce4 Ti 4600 with v-sync disabled, then the LCD would look 
like total crap.

I have adjusted to the LCD, but I haven't forgotten how great my games 
looked on a CRT.  I still remember when I had a 17" Sony Trinitron 
monitor, and I was highly pleased at the picture quality.  In fact, I'll 
go after one of Samsung's 19" CRT beasts once I feel the need.  A friend 
of mine bought one, and it totally blew my LCDs away.  For now, my LCDs 
have been great for everything I do, especially since I have a small 
computer desk in a medium-size apartment.
