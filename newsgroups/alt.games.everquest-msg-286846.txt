Caveat: I don't play an chanter.  But if this is referring to the 
"pet hold" AA, it's a must for some raids.  It's not a matter of
telling your pet to back off.  Sometimes if the pet engages the
mob at all, it's too late.  E.g., if you get by an AoE so your pet
rushes in, and now YOU have aggro.  And I recall one target where
any time a PC or pet dies it generates adds.  I don't know all the
reasons it can come up, but I know there's been more than one raid
where the order went out, anyone who didn't have "pet hold" was to
kill their pet BEFORE we started.
