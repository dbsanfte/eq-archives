It's quite interesting how things have developed on Bristlebane: the
only genuine uberguild on the server is tearing through Time (trying
Tier 4 last time I heard), another two who've been Elemental for a
long, LONG time but seem unable to progress and another who've been
Elemental for about a month.

I expect my guild and one other to be Elemental fairly soon, they've
pretty much skipped VT while we've farmed the life out of it so
they're probably a little ahead of us in PoP progression now if
anything (oh and can I say a sarcastic yay here to "Backflagging the
World 2003" and all the lovely bugs in /raid which make it so much
more fun to mill around in PoT than actually zoning in and killing
crap.)

After that I don't see any guilds ready to seriously attempt Emp any
time soon, the one that was working their way through Ssra mob by mob
jumped ship to Shadowbane.
