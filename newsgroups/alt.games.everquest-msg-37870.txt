LOL - I know, I know - they shouted about it when they 
were talking to me, too.  I was never stupid enough to 
actually *ask* - I mean geez, I had to live through 
Barney porn and vibrators, if they're not telling me 
something, I'm not asking.

(How about "Flame"?  *I'll* know who you're talking 
aboud :D)
