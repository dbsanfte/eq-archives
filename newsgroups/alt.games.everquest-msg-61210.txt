You forgot the "for me" at the end of that sentence.

It's not but pking and Pvp are not the same thing. Pking is being
killed with no choice in the matter. Pvp is going into a battle
knowing it's a battle.  You cannot be Pked in DAoC.  Period.

Yeah the Uberguilds who powerleveled their way to the 40's are
leaving. The game is unfinished and the higher levels are unitemized.
lack of quests, tasks, items, tradeskills, and higher level uber mobs
means they have nothing to do but RvR and unfortunately for them there
are no opponents since they outleveled everyone.  

The game was released early, they rushed to the top and found nothing
there. more content is being added weekly and just ahead of the normal
leveled players.
