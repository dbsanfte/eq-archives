Seems, by the way, that I simply had a lucky run
back when I wrote this.  I've since averaged no
better than 50% on pairs, and of course down around
25% on trios.

OK, I'll be the first to admit that clerics have little
to whine about, and that there are several classes
more in need of a fix.

Nonetheless, this spell line is, in my opinion, broken.

If, like harmony, it did not function as a taunt when
it failed, it would be very usable.

Alternately, if, as I experienced briefly there back
when I first came back into the game, its reliability
rate was fairly high, it would also be quite usable.

Working as infrequently as it does, there is little
reason to try it; clerics pull so infrequently that
the situation rarely arises, and because this line
works so rarely, clerics are not thought of as
a pulling class.

IF this line worked, clerics would be pretty
decent pullers really... not up to ranger/druid
standards, with their AOE "calming" effect,
but certainly capable of bringing out just part
of a spawn at a time.  Their good AC and
HP would give them the ability to survive
a thrashing on the way back, if it should
come to that, and they have a whole kit
bag of cheap "get me outta here" cards,
from Root, Stun, Fear, Flash of Light... at
middle levels, Atone can work wonders in
an overpull (these are not the druids you were
looking for).

Really bad pull, AOE Fear and Gate over the
zone line... its not FD, but it is "forget I was
ever here"

I don't expect the lull line will ever be "repaired"
to my liking, and it really isn't necessary.  I just
hate to see a whole line of spells wasted, if they
weren't going to make this functional, why bother
including it?  How about a wis buff line instead?
That seems in keeping with the clerical genre.
