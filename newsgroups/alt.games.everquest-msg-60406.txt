? What gives you that idea? They don't base the requirements of the
game on the poll since the game is already coming out like that
anyway. The poll is just to see how many of their users are ready to
run Luclin to gauge possible sales or exactly how much "upgrade" your
computers talk they have to make.

No, you've misunderstood. It is an ALL or NONE. You can't choose to
see the old ogre but the new barb. You only can choose to have new
player models OFF (including the horse) or new player models ON
(including the horse) The reason why I throw the horse in there is
only the new models can be seen riding a horse, so if you only have
old you'll just see the regular old character running along at jboots
speed.

The only model you'll see with OFF will be the Kitty model.
Unless I get a 256 meg or more sim soon and a geforce 2 something I'll
be doing the OFF option I guess.
