True. And you might even get to play with a Dragon on the way there.
Binding near Nexus will work, especially if you're looking for an excuse
to enchant mana vials or whatnot while waiting for the spires to fire. If
you're *really* desperate, you could make friends with a druid.  Personally,
I'd recommend binding in Plane of Knowledge. :)

But my comment was more aimed at the fact that the Stein of Moggok quest
requires kiola nuts from Ocean of Tears. Which pretty much requires waiting
for ship. A person who plans ahead and has bank space to spare might well
get a backpack or two of the annoying things...
