While the general consensus on you has been you're not exactly the 
brightest bulb, I would have guessed even you could have understood 
the above. The reason my statements were qualified was because unlike
you and the other know-it-all pricks who find it so easy to castigate the 
mother and her deceased son, I don't know all the circumstances of
what went down. While knowing dick doesn't stop you from making
unqualified assertions, it does me or anyone else with the slightest
notion of fairness and reason.
