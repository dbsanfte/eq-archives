Well if they ever decided their current solution, not allowing
profiteering, didn't work for them I would recommend they create a gimp
server for folks who need to purchase things and the folks like you who
would provide them.  I don't have an issue with either your kind or your
customers, so long as they are not playing the same game I am. 
Segregating such folks to a particular server would serve to satisfy my
desire to not play with folks like that and still  provide folks with
the opportunity to buy whatever made them happy and you with an
opportunity to make cash off of them.
