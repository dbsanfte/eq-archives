Well, not entirely true.  Verant has said that the -entire game- is FFA.  
However, they define "Free For All" to mean that the first person engaging 
a mob has the rights to it, and you don't get any rights to it on the 
basis that you are "camping" it.

People tend to wilfully misinterpret this in the presence of rare pops 
like the AC.
