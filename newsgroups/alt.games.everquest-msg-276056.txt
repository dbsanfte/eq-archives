Um... either you're talking about VSR not VS, which is singificantly tougher,
or your brother was feeding you a line.

Real VS was not duoable when 60 was the max level.

65, yes...  with high resistances and raid gear, he could be beat.   (if you
can resist his lifetap, he becomes trivial.)   But that didn't happen until
PoP.   In Luclin, the last time the max level was 60, it was still a big deal
that he could be manaburned down with a single group of wizards.   Nobody was
duoing him then.  Maybe single group, for the uberest of the Vex Thall
raiders... but not duoing.

If you have the resistances to overcome his lifetap, you can kill him with
anything.   If you don't, then it's all about DPS.   Who was there besides the
tank (and what kind of tank?  55 paladin?  70 warrior?) and the two clerics?
What level were your nukers and how many?  Any melee DPS?   Were you buffed
and hasted?

If you're not resisting his lifetap (and especially if he's getting lucky on
proc'ing it) then you have to overcome 1500 healing every couple seconds, and
get him down 32k hp.   That can be hard if you're lower leveled, or
understaffed.

Could have just been unlucky on the spawns, alhtough 5 hours, or 15'ish
spawns, is a very long streak.
