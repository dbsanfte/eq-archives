    Two solitudes. One: "It has existed in Luclin like this since the
beginning, so there has been no change, ergo no nerf." Two:"The command has
existed in the game since before Luclin. Pre-SoL, it worked everywhere.
After SoL, it does not work everywhere. Ergo, it was nerfed the day SoL was
released." And never the two shall see eye-to-eye.
