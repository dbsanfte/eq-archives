You only get the stats from the food when it is the first food you
WOULD eat.  It has no effect if you actually eat it, other than
slowing down the time before you will next eat.  

Put the food with the stats in your top inventory and you will see the
stats applied to your character.  Force yourself to eat some not stat
giving food so you can keep those stats longer.  Develop a habit of
forcing yourself to eat non-stat foods regularly, and you can get the
stat benefit of a Halas 10 lb. pie for weeks from a single pie.
