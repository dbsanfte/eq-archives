I tried my best to follow those leveling rules.  Problem is, it turns out
that my Paladin has a severe case of wanderlust, and would leave LoIO ever
level or so to see what else was out there.  Usualy wound up going back, but
it broke up the monotony of days and days of sarnak, and I was always hoping
to find something a bit better.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
