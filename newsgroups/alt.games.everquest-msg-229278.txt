I have never once seen any piece of quest armor drop from any mob near
the entrance.  I have only seen it drop from the summoning, see-invis
mobs in and past the arena and at the bank.  I have killed in the
arena many, many times...enough that I hate the place.  And I have
probably killed several times as many entrance mobs.

Perhaps you know something I don't.

If you can find a few people around 60+, you don't need a raid to do
the arena.  We have done it with a 60 monk tanking, a 62 ranger for
some DPS, and a Shaman healing and slowing.  If 3 level 60+ can do it,
6 people around 55 should be able to do it as long as you have a tank
and slower who aren't morons.  I guess it depends a bit on who your
friends are though.  If everyone you know is 55 or under, it may take
a few groups.

Kael is a waste of time for most people these days unless they are
looking to fix faction or kill Vindi/AoW/whatever.  There are a few
quests here and there for this and that.  But the regular Thurgadin
armor quests there just aren't worth the trouble.  You would spend
your time better by just farming plat and buying better stuff.

If you want to farm armor solo, have you tried killing Disturbed
Elysian Remains in Umbral Planes?  They aren't that tough.  They don't
summon (unlike most things there).  They are fairly well seperated
from the other mobs.  And they pop near some nice safe valleys in the
zone, well away from the usualy hunting grounds for groups doing
moktors etc...  Best part is they drop almost exclusively druid armor.
 The place is very popular for Druids looking for armor upgrades. 
Check it out.
