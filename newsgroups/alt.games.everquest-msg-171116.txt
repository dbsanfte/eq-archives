But surely you misunderstand... I *don't* want religion in public schools, I
can't imagine a worse violation of rights than to have religion in public
schools.  Notice I say "public" because it's the parent's choice to send a
child to a private school, the school is not run by the government, so
nobody's having a particular religion forced down their throat -- if they
don't like it, go to someone else's school.  But public school are and
should remain to be non-religious.

I have no problem whatsoever with your praying with your kids, taking them
to church, teaching them your religion, etc.  By all means do so.  As long
as your not getting other people's kids in a place they have no choice but
to go and forcing them to be inundated by something they may not agree with
or want to hear, you're not violating anyone's rights.

I fail to see where the "anti-religious" crowd doesn't like this.  The
"anti-religious" crowd (by which I assume you mean atheists) does not want
religion in public schools, but I've never heard anyone arguing against
people's right to have their own private schools of whatever religion.
Maybe you've seen this though, and if so I certainly wouldn't agree...
everyone has a right to their religion, as long as it's a voluntary thing,
not a public thing where the people present have no choice.
