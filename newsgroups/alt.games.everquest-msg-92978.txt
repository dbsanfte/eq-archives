Hehe, my ES arms just turned on too, I don't know how I lived without
them...

For your specific example, nuke them with Calefaction and loot.  =P

I've been taking on shardwurms (AoE breath and ancient or greater types can
cast) a bunch, and did the Chancellor of Di'Zok lately.   Before that I did
the godawful deepwater goblin camp in Lake Rathe  (Cleansed Spirit of
Antonica says hihihi), but I did the DW camp at 44, some solo (could keep
top 3 cleared, but used Deep on one of the spawns, hehe) and some with 45
warrior partner (could keep top 3 down easy and occasionally kill a lower
one)

For the most part, Chloroplast will suck up *most* of the damage from
casters I've found (unless it's chain nuking you *shudder*), resist buffs
help, and Skin like Diamond/Nature is a must.

Oh, BTW, Chancellor and some Ancient Shardwurms gate, ugh.   (and sarnak
don't care how green you are, they want to eat you).

Oh, yeah, caster strategy... uh, mine would be to suck it up, you CAN out
heal most casters damage (once again, unless they're chain nuking you)

For the Chancellor, I was doing fine with him and a green Adherent, started
full mana (and free root necklace, and ES arms) 60% mana and the Adherent
wandered off or something when he gated, pulled him at about 40% hp again,
got him and, uh, 3 or 4 green sarnak, almost died myself but a 40-something
warrior ran back there and helped me finish him off (primarily by preventing
gate number 2 and by slaughtering green agro)

Ultimately, the reason most druids (read as all dr00ds) can't handle casters
is because they're gimpy assed bastards who do nothing but quad kite with
248 wisdom for 15 levels and then can't figure out why their 25
fire/cold/magic and 300 ac can't protect them.   Now if only my Defense
would go up past 178.  Offense is max 200 *glares at spikecoat*.
