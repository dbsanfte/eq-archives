Same thing in Highpass.  There were over 200 peeps sitting around in
between mm's.  It did spawn a few jerk, lamers, losers, and assholes
who does mass XLoc, training a bunch of mobs, and one (or 2?)
frequently trained a rogue 1.5 npc over.  Worse of all is most were
whining a lot about not being to get close to click on the npc.
Sounds like the whiners are really noobs since anyone can use either
F8 or ~ key to target the npc from a less crowded distance, and still
get a mission.

I did get a few occasions of not being to get in but mostly did fine.
No crash on Maelin that I know of.

almost 40 aa's in 8 hours.  and one HHK mission was on the crazy side
with 6 clerics and no tank.  Still managed to finish that one before
the task timer expired.
