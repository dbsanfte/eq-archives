When fighting with someone else, I usually try to get behind the MOB. (none
of my characters are a Rogue)

I would expect the MOB to have less change of avoiding my blows if I'm
behind it, but have never seen proof of this. The MOB also then has to turn
completly around when it then aggros on me, placing it's back to my partner.

Is there any benefit to this? Or am I just wasting time while moving into
position?

Does it matter if I'm standing "on top of" a groupmate when fighting? I know
that the dang orcs will "stack" when attacking me, and it doesn't affect
their ability to strike me. I also usually try to be in a position that is
"clear" of other PC's fighting the same MOB. Seems that we'd interfere with
one another otherwise... /shrug

Thanks.
