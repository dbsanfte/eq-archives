Course sounds more like it might be around SWG time (at least a year)
so DAOC has time to make some cash at least.

World of warcraft

And blizzard does stuff about the best and makes the 
most successful games. Heck, even if they just get the koreans
who play starcraft on board they'll have the biggest numbers of any
mmorpg.

My god the models in this kick all behind. Kudos to them for keeping
this secret for so long.. from the movies and such they are pretty
damn far along. Can you say industry blindsided?:

Gamespot preview

Actual site

http://www.blizzard.com/wow/

Oh, and the actual site was slashdotted, so a better place to get the
movies is from Gamespot. There preview one with the 2 guys talking is
pretty good.

Besides being 3d, all the objects you can wear and such will not just
be textures alone but also have 3d mesh, which varies so looks will be
more unique.

I've been saying for a while now I thought blizzard should get into
the mmorpg ring cause they'd do it right probably.
