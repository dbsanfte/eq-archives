As far as I'm aware, he *is* a random pop. God knows we haven't seen
any pattern and we've had people sitting at that camp for weeks now.
However, yes, they are showing up en masse just a couple of seconds
*before* he appears which indicates to me that they have figured out
some way to cheat. Don't know how;  it's entirely possible that they
are using something other than ShowEQ (which I will be the first to
admit I know little about, having never used it myself); but they are
doing it. The same guild has pulled this little trick the last 4 times
he has spawned with us literally sitting on the spawn point.
