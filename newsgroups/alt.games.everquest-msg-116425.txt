In Eq, only, the mouse has become very hard to use, it takes 3 or 4 passes
to be able to click on small boxes.  You move to where you intend to point i
overshoots you back up it overshoots the other way. you have almost no fine
or precision control in game.

       It is not mouse, I switched out Logitech optical usb, for generic
microsoft ps2 port mouse it was just as bad. In all other applications mouse
is perfect.  Does not matter whether i set in gam responce to slow or fast.
I have changed surfaces also.

         I even tried in game video settings they did not help.  I have 512k
memory 900mhz processor and solid DSL connection. I use geforce 2 TO 64meg
vido card.  except for mouse problem everythin works like charm.
