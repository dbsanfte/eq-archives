Actually, "will donate" bothers me, but semantically. Bear with me.

Long ago when buff casters first started offering their services, they
would set up shop at some commonly known landmark and holler out
"Doing something useful, donations welcome". This meant "I'll buff
you, and you don't have to pay me, but it would be really swell if you
did". 

So long as both sides understood the arrangement, it was a pretty
happy thing.

Now, we have people hollering "Need Buff, will donate" when what they
actually mean is "Want buff, will pay". Why not say what you mean? In
fact, how about saying just how much you're willing to pay, up front.
Saying you'll donate is vague, and not as likely to attract a
favorable response as saying "Want Buff, will pay 20 plat".

Accuracy is important.
