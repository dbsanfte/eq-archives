Subject: Anyone been bound against their will?

Last night I was in a group.  We had just gotten started and were medding prior
to running into battle.  One of the guys asks me where I'm bound and I tell him
- ok it was far away, (but not really because of the knowledge books.)    The
guy stands up and with no further commentary binds me!  I was so stunned I
didn't even say anything.
Now for one if I wanted myself bound I could do it myself.  Certainly I would
*ask* for a bind if I couldn't.   (I kept the old bind spot because it was
convenient for ME and the people I normally group with).   I felt truly
violated by this action, (I don't know why really... I guess because I wasn't
given a choice, the guy didn't ask, it was terribly presumptuous, controlling,
and downright rude, I dont KNOW WHY BUT IT PISSED ME OFF!!!)
Has anyone else had this happen?
