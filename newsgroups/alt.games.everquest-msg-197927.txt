    Any CH rot where the mob is one-tanked. Any CH rot where the mob is
X-tanked, and you have one smart cleric on the rotation to /assist off.

    Not when someone is telling you "cast NOW".

    Like I said, /assist the one cleric on the raid who is a main. You can
even have a hotkey set up for it. Be sure to tell that cleric afterwards how
easy being a cleric is!

    Yeah, that's a tough task. So tough, that it's our second box clerics
that usually do it first in any fight that calls for it. They've done it
more than I have.

    That is a pretty unique encounter. I wish there were more like it. Most
AoE's can either be resisted, ranged against, or ridden out with someone
else responsible for keeping up countermeasures.

    For every fight where not having someone pause an extra 0.2 seconds
means disaster, there's two fights where not being able to switch tanks
because you're stuck in a /pause, or not being able to speed up/slow down to
adapt to the damage output, will mean disaster. It also trains clerics to
not think, but to be passive button pushers that hate the CH rot. Recently,
we had a wipeout on Fennin Ro. I scrolled back up, and this is what I saw:

Main Tank has been completely healed.
You tell healingchannel, "CH on >> Main Tank << NEXT_CLR NEXT!"
Next_clr tells healingchannel, "CH inc on ** Fennin Ro ** Next_clr2 up!"

    Next_clr could not see that he had done something wrong. We were in a
rotation with no recast delay - as soon as it refills, cast it. Next_clr
said that he didn't target Fennin Ro on purpose, but that the main tank had
died and he had been summoned just as he went to heal. Ok, fine. What does
that tell me about how long it took you to cast CH the last time, or about
your positioning? Main Tank died waiting for Next_clr's heal, but Next_clr
could not understand that. He'd just done what he's supposed to do, pressed
his CH macro.

    If they think it's easy, they will replace you. I've seen it in my own
guild, as second-box clerics start coming out of the woodwork to earn extra
raid credit and push aside real clerics. "We don't need a real cleric for
that, do we?"

    "Our groups"? I know there's some guilds, like Afterlife, where
cross-group healing is strongly frowned upon. My guild isn't like that. It's
a free-for-all, lots of /assist healing off active mobs and Supernal
Remedies. Even with a healing channel, where heal calls can be seen clearly,
I can call a CH on a tank at 80% health and as soon as he hits 60% health
two people will SR him, causing me to duck out of my heal. Unless you're
running short on healers, there's no penalty for wasting mana. And again, I
can't untrain these people to preserve mana. "Why, there's tons of us here.
Besides, I want something to do, and what if you get hit or move or
something and your heal doesn't go off? Huh? HUH?"

    Sadly, the second boxes in my guild prove you wrong. =(
