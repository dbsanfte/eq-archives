As for raids I don't know. I've yet to hear anything about a "guild" having
to "reserve" a spot for a raid! The idea of "reserving" blows my mind. How
can a game be fun if you have to take out a time slot to raid an area!?!?!
I play on Vallon Zek and have seen many a people "removed" from their
camping spot by other teams. (A quick slaughter mind you)

I would suggest to everyone to give it try. Just _don't_ be discouraged in
the early levels if you die a lot. Play on the teams servers first of all.
This
will give you the _safety_ of being in your home town. I didn't leave Grobb
till I was about level 10-11.

Another reminder, if you choose to start in Freeport get used to the fact
that
sometimes the dark elves like to gather up and attack the newbies. Keep that
in mind.

I had an easier time starting out as a Troll or a Halfling, just due to
geographical
reasons. Look how snug Rivervale is? And Grobb? Hardly ever saw a pker in
those areas.

The greatest thing tho is to be around levels 10-13 and finally feel _brave_
enuff
to journey onwards. That's the best feeling is knowing that anything can
happen
to you on the way. It adds more "realism" to a fantasy game.

I wouldn't go back for anything.
