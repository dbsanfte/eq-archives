Personally I don't mind giving up some XP for guildmates to get the items they
need. XP can be gotten back easy enough but the drop items are few and sometimes
far between. Any situation can go bad like yours and the only problem I see
would be if you did not make it up to the raid members that died and got nothing
for the raid. They will need help in the future of that I am sure.
