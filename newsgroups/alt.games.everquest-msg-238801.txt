    I'm sorry but that time estimate is way off base. I'd be lucky to spend
5 hours a week in EQ at the moment - my main is 65 and those five hours
usually include a raid.

    Yes it will take typically 4 times as long for a person with 5 hours a
week to reach 65 than a person with 20 hours - but the guy with 5 hours a
week *will* enjoy his time more.
