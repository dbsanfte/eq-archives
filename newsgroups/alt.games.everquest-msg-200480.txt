You know, it might be nice to actually wait on a bit more data before
you go off the deep end. Feedback from one or two groups on test and a
couple of soloists with an agenda is hardly the final word on the
subject. I've also seen a couple of posts that seem to agree with a
15-20% reduction. 

Or, heaven forbid, they might actually have screwed up the code on
test. Hard to believe with SOE I know, but it could happen <g>. I
don't think they'd flat out lie in a patch message and the math
doesn't add up with a ZM nerf of more than 17%. If they were gonna
nerf PoP that hard, why lie about it? 

I do agree with you about AoE groups which is gonna suck. There's also
a couple of easy fixes you could do with that, the most obvious one
being just to limit the max number of mobs that can agro on anyone to
something like 10, with the rest just plain ignoring people instead of
the way that anything over 4 works now. Not that I have a whole lot of
faith in SOEs ability to come up with a creative solution but they're
certainly out there.
