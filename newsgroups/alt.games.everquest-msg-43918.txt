Stolen from a Zeb server EZBoard and posted with the author (Tahlia)'s
permission.   No, I won't be there though it sounds like a LOT of fun for
only $16.  It is NOT limited to just Zeb folks.  Tahlia went to DragonCon
last month and they had a gathering of EQ players.  I guess they only
expected 10 people to show and over a hundred did, so Tahlia thought it'd be
cool to have a gathering dedicated to just this.

Since she's planning on providing dessert (undoubtedly on her own dime), if
you plan on going, please let her know so she has an idea of numbers.

Anyway, here's the post:

----

It is now set in stone. The Atlanta Area Gathering of EQ players will be at
Dave & Buster's in Marietta, GA. www.daveandbusters.com/

The D&B is located at I-75 and Delk Road. There is a link to Map Quest at
the above link.

The price per person is $16. This price includes:

- A badge with your name, main toon name, and main server name.
- 3 hours of unlimited use of three 6 pocket billiard tables (pool tables)
- Unlimited Soda, Coffee, and Tea
- Buffet:
Salsa with tri-colored tortilla chips
Mesquite Grilled BBQ chicken halves
House Salad with the choice of three dressings
Corn on the cob
Potato Salad
Fresh baked rolls with butter
*Vegetarian meals will be provided for upon request
- Dessert is on me, I will go by Sweet Stuff or the Cheesecake Factory and
get the appropriate number of yummy cakes we need.
-There will be a Cash Bar for those who want a little kick to their punch.

Room Schedule:
5:00pm Show up
6:00pm Start Buffet
6-7:45pm Talk with one another.
7:45-8:00pm say Good-Byes and gather our things together.
8:00pm+ Go to individual Halloween Parties or lay seige to the arcade that
is outside the room we rent. FYI this Dave & Buster's has the virtual
reality pods for Battle Tech and/or Red Planet.
10:00pm+ Dave & Buster's requires everyone below 21 to leave so it is all
adults, however; that still gives everyone plenty of time to talk and play.

If you would like to come or have ANY questions please email me at
tahlia_treekin@yahoo.com that way I get an accurate count for the buffet and
dessert.

**D&B has House Policy that requires those individuals below the age of 21
to be accompanied by a parent or guardian. A guardian is an individual that
is above the age of 25 and agrees to be responsible for the conduct and
safety of the below 21 individual. Guardians and parents can accompany up to
three below 21 people.

Thank you,
