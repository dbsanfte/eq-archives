At the time, in my 20s, I kited by keeping myself sowed, and stopping and
nuking with my cold based nuke, then running around some more.  Perhaps they
were just relatively susceptible to cold based damage.  I did eventually do
root and rot as well, always cast my best debuff first in that case.  It may
have taken a couple of casts usually to land that, afterwards, there was no
problem.
