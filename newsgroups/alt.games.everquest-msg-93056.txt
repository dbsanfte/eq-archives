     With the change to DirectX 8.1, EverQuest now tells your video card
to do gamma correction in hardware instead of doing it itself in
software.
If your video card cannot do hardware gamma correction, the gamma slider
will have no effect.  There is no software workaround.  You have to use
your brighness and contrast knobs.

     Not that I've seen.  Me, I leave it off to help the game run faster
and to minimize crashes.  I have had mysterious crashes to desktop or
complete system hangs reaching all the way from when SoL came out to
about two weeks ago, which no amount of system or driver tweaking could
eliminate.  They finally went away all by themselves.  I have an ATI
Rage 128.
