Winterstorm, her husband, her buddy Shayne and I were all mischievous smart
asses.  This is what smart asses do.

I wanted to stop the online "relationship", hearing about her husband, her
life's problems, but at the same time I wanted her to group with me when my
schedule permitted for impersonal gaming purposes.  This was selfish, but it
is what I wanted I believe.

To be honest, yes it was a red flag but I was a nice guy before all this
shit got started.  I had my reservations about getting to know Winterstorm,
but I was new to the game and didn't know anyone really and thought I could
*gasp* make an EQ friend.  She was a magician, and I even thought I could
learn a thing or two about my character from her; she was level 30 something
at the time.  So, I asked friendly questions.  I honestly had no thoughts of
cyber sex or finding out more about her personal/sexual life...until later.
After she and I hit it off, I introduced myself 5 or 6 months later, even
though I SAW the red flag!  At that point, I was partly curious about cyber
sex, and I might have thought it would be harmless.  THAT'S where I was
wrong.  EQ ain't the place to be a "nice guy" and try to care about married
womens'
problems.

I asked her about that point blank, lol, many times.  Her reason was that
she was shy and that people would reveal what they wanted her to know.  I
bought it because I was desperate enough.
