I was kiting a stonegazer cockatrice this morning in the Overthere.  I was so
embarassed when this guy yells in OOC, "hey!  You Druid!  Don't kite your stuff
over me, I'm killing it if it hits me again!".  I had never had a pull agro on
someone else, (and I hadn't even been close to the guy...)  But I *could* see
that the SC DID run over and hit him, he wasn't trying to KS.  I drug it off
and got it killed.  Went to apologize to the guy and buff him and beg
forgiveness but the guy had already logged.  Really bummed out my morning.  no
wonder druids get a bad name... :(
