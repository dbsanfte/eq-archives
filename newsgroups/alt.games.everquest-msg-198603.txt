You can, or could - LoY used exactly that model, well buy key and
download - and IIRC you can pick up keys at the main website. No cheaper,
possibly for a distribution deal contract stating this, possibly because
they cant pare off that much price by dumping the box - my guess is the
biggest cost in the box set is either the manual or more likely the free
first month of play... I'd guess its a contract thing given the LoY was so
cheap.

Also if they did a lot of buy key and download option my guess is they
might not be able to support it as easily on their patch server....
