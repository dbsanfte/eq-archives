Well, tried that on AB, some idiot had passworded the channel then left so 
there was noone in it. I managed to guess the password ('tradeskills') and 
get in, but then couldn't figure out how to remove it.

Anyone know how to delete a channel password?

the format is something like
/chat password <new password> [channel]

But the new password is a required parameter, so if you leave it out it 
just thinks the channel number you specified is the new password for your 
default channel (whatever's on 1). I can't see a way to de-password protect 
a channel.
