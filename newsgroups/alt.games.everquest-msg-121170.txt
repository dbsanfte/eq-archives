Well, I can't exactly flame you for being truthful when you're talking
totally out of your ass.

I would have more fun if spoiled little brats didn't like to rub other
people's faces in the fact that they think they're too good to follow
the rules of the game. I don't think "Disdik Upinya" is a creative or
cool name. Nor do I think "Gokkuu", "Drrrizzt", or "Tylerdurden" are
at all creative or cool. (All names I've reported in the past)
