One thing I've always been impressed with ( yes I am a newbie ) is that
higher level characters have invariably tried to help me out.

The first time this happened I didn't even realise I'd been helped until the
other player had moved a way away.

As a newbie I do appreciate being helped out. I don't expect it, I
don't -ask- for it but when someone helps me I am always appreciative and
I'd return the favour if I could. When I get to a higher level I'm going to
return to the newbie areas and do what I can to help them out too.

All I can say to those of you who hate newbies is: Don't let a few bad
unpleasent newbie players spoil how you see the game. In my experience most
of the people I've met aren't like that at all.

Those types of players are rapidly going to get fed up and move on, leaving
the rest of us to enjoy ourselves!

Just my 2c
