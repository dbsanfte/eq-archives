 I think some people are taking 'fair' to mean something different than
others are. Two people want something and they roll. The act of rolling
is fair because it's not 'biased' towards one person or another.
However, on a whole different level, that roll doesn't take things into
consideration like raid attendence, what it upgrades, etc. That's what
what are talking about when they say rolling isn't fair. They aren't
talking about the roll itself. At least I'm not. Rolling is a fair way
to decide on something but it's not necessarily a fair way to distribute
loot.

 Not many of the raids we do these days have droppable loot. However,
you certainly wont make any friends if you'd random on an item you
weren't going to use just to sell it. It doesn't matter how you justify
it, that's not going to fly. At least not in my guild. If you get
something that's droppable, it's considered guild property and when you
get an upgrade you pass it down to someone else.

 Some people are also fuzzy on this if they're not in a guild that uses
the awarded loot system. It's not like the top/oldest people get
everything they want. Or guild uses a system similar to what others have
mentioned; people who want an item send a tell to the class leaders,
from there the class leaders send their recommendations to the main
officer who makes the final decision.

 Basically it's really simple and comes down to this: If you attend the
raids and you're going to get the loot.
