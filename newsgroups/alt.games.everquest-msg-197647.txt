Unfortunately the only items I know of are a pain to get, and fairly
high level.

There's the Signet Earring of Veracity, which is the fourth earring in
a series of quests out of Katta Castellum.  (It actually has Truesight,
which is a combo UV/See Invis.)  It's doable by as few as three or four
level 60+ people for the third step and two groups for the fourth step,
but requires a fair bit of time farming guards with way too many hps.
Not too bad if it's being worked on solely for you, but will take a
looooong time if everyone's trying to get one.

The class-specific helms from the quests in Plane of Mischief have
Ultravision, but there isn't one for beastlords as far as I know.
I've never been there as nobody seems to want to waste their time there
anymore.
