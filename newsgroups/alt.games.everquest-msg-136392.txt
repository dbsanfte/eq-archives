Yeah, unfortunately the channels stopped working about half way through our
chat :(   When I zoned though contact was re-established!   Dunno if it was
game-wide, but it happened to all of us in ST

Channels messed up again last night too.. heh I had statue inc, press
Hotkey.. hmm no message.   "/guild Channels are busted again.. oh yeah,
Statue of Rallos Zek inc"

Was funny how much people panicked, "we have no channels!! what is the
cleric rotation gonna do?!?!"...  anybody would think a month or 2 ago we
didn't have channels :)

Ah well, we struggled on.... sortof  http://www.mas.ukshells.co.uk/aow.jpg
I still feel like cryin when i look at that SS :(  This bastard is the bane
of our guild
