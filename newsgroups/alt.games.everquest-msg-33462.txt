That really is odd. I've never really seen anyone have trouble with orcs

Like I said, it preys on people stupidity. Sometimes they aren't buffed,
a lot of the time they arent wearing any gear etc...

Of course theres ways around it. Don't forget, conflag wands are used
quite a bit too. The second last time I died on my necro was in GD while
I was farming CoV faction. I was lagging and died to a frost giant
elite, I went to loot my corpse but didn't buff up before I looted. I
don't have enough space in my bags to bag my gear so it was all on me. I
stood up from looting my corpse and saw a 60 necro sitting there (out of
range to me), I inspected him and in his rear view inv screen I saw a
caster casting something. Caught an IC, 130dmg, then draught, 200dmg,
then two charges of a flag wand which did 360dmg and 280dmg. I did try
to gate but it collapsed (arg), and shadowstep didn't register as I was
lagging.

I guess I felt safe being way out of the way of people, let my guard
down, and as such lost gear :p

Yep on RZ I always keep a full set of buffs up.

I've gotta say, its surprisingly hard to kill someone who doesn't want
to die. That was the point I was trying to make to "rick" in this
thread.

btw do people on blue servers even keep gate memmed in a permanent slot?
I've seen screenshots of various random blue peoples spell sets and I
see most tend not to have any gate type spell memmed. Thats something
that is quite a disadvantage while exp'ing on RZ, I essentially have to
keep 3 slots filled with exp-useless spells so i don't get my gear
ganked (harmshield, gate, shadowstep).
