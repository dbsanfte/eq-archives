  LOL!!!!!  This one got me (can you say several times)!  I can't wait until
I can kick that guys butt!

Ones I might add are:

"You be the healer, don't worry, we'll keep them off you."
     (This happened to me the first time I tried to be the group healer.)

"The skeletons in Kithicor couldn't possibly come all the way to the
Rivervale entrance."

"He's *just* a desert madman."
     (Some of those guys got some heavy magic...I found out the hard way.)
