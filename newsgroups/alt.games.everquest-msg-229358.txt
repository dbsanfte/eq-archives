I am all for fixing content, but this is redicules. I have had 4 chances to
play in the last 3 days, and every time, eather it was already down or going
down in 5 minutes.

What little play I did have, made me knotice very quickly that the Warior
Agro fix was mor a Knight taunt nerf.  In the hole, where last week taunt
toook everytime, and I never lost agro, even without using my Terror line of
spells, yesterday we lost our cleric, because in 15 try's only one taunt
worked. Every other one said you failed to taunt...  If you want to make
Wariors what they should be, do it by improving there Taunt ability, not
take ours ( knights ) away.

I set forth to check this by going to Echo Caverns where I have a good idea
of the level range, and found that Taunt didn't get to a reliable 90% untill
i was taunting Light Blue mobs, and even then, some of them where resisting
taunt about 1/2 the time.  I hope this was just another one of those things
that got broke and are going to need an emergancy fix, but seeing there
direction, even if it wasn't ment to be they will probabaly leave it as it
is.
