Quite possibly your news admin has our servers on a reject list. An
unclued admin may think mine is an open server because they allow
anyone who asks to use it. Very wrong, I use it because it is pretty
well spam clean, and you still have to get a user account. It is just
that they will happily give you one free after you verify that the
registeration e-mail is valid. And they will revoke it in a heartbeat
if you abuse USENET.
