Apparently I've lucked out, then.  I tried logging onto Test a week or
so ago and found it was "Locked".  So after that I started watching the
Server Status page to see when Test became available again.  It was
always shown as Down, so I never tried again to log onto it.  I was
beginning to suspect that the info was wrong, since I hadn't seen gripes
here about Test being unavailable for a week. :-)  But the good news for
me is that the bogus Server Status info kept me from logging into Test,
which is great because my reason for going there would've been to see if
my graphics card worked with the new graphics engine, which I now learn
isn't up on Test anyway!

Thus Nature maintains her delicate balance....
