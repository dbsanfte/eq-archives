Sorry for hijacking a follow-up, didn't see the first message.

>> Hi there,
>>
>> Ok I've stood on the sidelines long enough. I played Ultima Online for a
>> while, but Everquest and all its potential attractions has grabbed my
>> interest guys. I need some help though.
>>
>> Here's my story:
>> P3 550
>> Voodoo 3 card.
>> Windows XP
>> 256 Ram.
>>
>> 56k Modem running from a quality ISP in Australia.
>>
>> 1. First of all, will my system cope? I know the latest expansion has a
>> monster hunger for power..but can I play with just the original game, plus
>> 1-2 of the other expansions? Or would I be missing out on too much
> flavour?

P2-350, GeForce2MX, 256Mb ram and everything pre-luclin runs acceptably.
Really scraping the bottom of the barrel for luclin itself though.

>> 2. Does the game have a sense of adventure and relief? Can I spend time in
> a
>> town chatting/socialising-soaking up atmosphere...then head out into vast
>> and varied wilderness seaking fame and fortune? Is this the basic theme of
>> Everquest? or is it more about baking and woodcutting like Ultima.

Hm, not really. Everquest is essentially about gaining levels and loot as
far as I can see. There are quests, and trade-skills, but they're generally
pretty limited. And by the time you can do them you often aren't impressed
by the return. Better to farm loot and buy something off a higher level
character/

Of course it can become a social environment on top of this. There are
helpful, interesting and sociable people around. The game won't deliver
these people to you but you might find them. Guilds are probably a good
start.

And there is a sense of adenture. It's a pretty large and varied world
full of danger and reward and each level means you can explore
more of the world.

>>
>> 3. Is everywhere extremely crowded, particular hoardes of people camped
> out
>> at monster spawns?  This doesnt appeal to me.

As an Australian it works the other way around. If you play in the
evening you'll often find the world is much too empty. Numerous times
i've been the only one in the area, and even multiple adjoining areas.
For example I've had the Temple of Cazic-Thule, Feerot, Oggok and
Innothule swamp all to myself. 1 city, 2 low level zones and a mid
level dungeon and i'm the only person in it. Or going to OT (a popular
XP grind zone) and finding 4 people in it. And since EQ encourages
grouping this can be quite a problem.
