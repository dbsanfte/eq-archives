Well, neither Hymn of Restoration (level 6 heal song) nor Cassindra's Chant
of Thought (level 20 mana song) actually stack.

HoR is really more of a regen buff -- increase natural regen by X, rather
than increase current hp by X -- and consequently, doesn't stack if
multiple bards play the song at once. Also, restarting the song doesn't
buy you anything since AFAIK the target only gets the benefits if it's up
at the instant he gets his regular regen.

CCoT isn't a buff at all, so *stacking* isn't relevant, any more than
asking if nukes stack or warriors stack. CCoT just gives everyone in group
X mana (X = 1 or 2, can't recall) whenever it pulses. So yes, for CCoT,
you do gain added benefit both from multiple bards singing it *and* from
restarting the song when it casts. Restarting the song instead of letting
it just continue will increase effectiveness by 30 to 50%.
