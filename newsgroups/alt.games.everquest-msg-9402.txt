I've ported ported into WL several times while Wuoshi was up and had no
problem.  That is a barely dubious con.  The arena giants in Kael are
your best bet on the factions, but if you aren't high enough level or
don't have the man power for them you can work wolves and giants in GD
and EW.  Takes a lot of kills if you are doing the lower end stuff
though, much faster if you can get into Kael.  Expect to have very great
faction with the Coldain long before you lose KOS to the dragonkin, they
are a bear to get in good with.
