I tinkered with it for about two hours.  It reminded me a lot of Lineage 
2, where things were...'different'....  Not like the other MMORPG's.  
Strange controls, and strange-ish looking characters to select from.  
Though I have to admit I didn't give it a fair shake, for a soon as I 
dropped in to start playing, there on the screen was a f'n radar screen 
just like Star Wars, with the baddies one color, you another, npc's, etc.  
I don't care if it's turnoffable or not, I think -any- radar sucks 
supreme.  Appeasing the majority with a silver spoon.  Aargh.  Hell it 
might even have the SWG 'searchlight' for quests.  Or maybe they've gone 
further and put in the 'autoquest' key.  You push it and the quest is 
done automatically for you by a servant. 

I'll barely be able to tolerate WOW's map that keeps you from ever 
getting lost and scared. 

Obviously someone else can be far more objective than I on this one.

Bob (still waiting on a mmorpg that will get back to the roots, and make 
us -work- for what we get.
