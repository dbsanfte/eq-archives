I pick November 8, 2005, at 3am california time.

3 months  ago I'd have scoffed at the notion, since at that time we 
"knew" that EQ2 was really a completely different game designed and due 
to be marketted to capture a different sort of gamer, the "casual" gamer 
  that wasn't going for EQ since it was too much commitment, or the 
ex-EQ gamer who who could be lured back for a more casual version of the 
EQ vision.

Successful EQ2 players who liked the game would then be lured into EQ1 
as the more hardcore version with raiding and other high end content; 
EQ2 would really be EQ Lite and used to get more new players for the 
"real" EQ.

This dream of the EQ2 plan turns out to have largely been conjured up in 
the heads of fans, based on hints and plenty of conjecture and best case 
guesswork.

Looks to me now, based on beta reports, as though EQ2 is indeed a 
seperate game from EQ1, but more of an upgrade, a successor... just as 
we originally suspected a year or more ago when they first started 
touting the thing.

This means that yes, EQ2 will possibly grab those ex EQ players and some 
people who never played EQ cause it was too much for them... but it will 
also grab some current EQ players, who move over to the new game.  And 
if its as robust as it seems, many of them will stick; we'll get a few 
back who miss the massive size and relatively mature state of the game 
(5 years of balancing and development) but a lot will stay gone.

Plus, its very likely that as new players come along, they will pick EQ2 
over EQ; why not, its new, and people love whats new.  Since they don't 
have any reason to know about the 5 years etc, whats going to bring them 
over to EQ, if its essentially positioned the same way?

EQ2 will drain away players from EQ1, and won't be feeding new players 
in... eventually, EQ1 will have to shrink just to maintain sufficient 
player base to actually do anything; a problem compounded by the fact 
that EQ is built around larger raid sizes at the high end than EQ2; when 
you need 50+ players in a raid to do something, a lack of players is 
really going to be painful.

I'm not really considering WOW as a factor here, I honestly don't think 
it will have any more impact than did SWG or COH... its EQ2 that strikes 
me as the EQ killer, long and lingering as that death may be.  WoW 
players are going to be quite clear that EQ (and EQ2 for that matter) is 
a different game, and that they should make their choice of which of the 
two to play based on the usual factors.  But EQ2 players are, I think, 
going to look at EQ1 the same way most Civilization II players looked at 
Civilization I...basically the same game, only more primative, with 
fewer features, uglier, with a worse interface.

Worse, -some- players are going to stick with EQ, and some will move on 
to join the new EQ2 players; this means EQ2 won't have as big an 
audience as it would if it was really a replacement for EQ.

This means SOE now owns 2 franchises neither of which has as large a 
player base as the one franchise they used to own!

Of course its already been explained to me how in today's corporate 
culture its better to start a new game and end up worse off on paper but 
have higher growth than it is to hold on to an existing revenue 
generator which isn't going to grow; its weird and it -shouldn't- be 
that way, but if stock value is all you care about then I see how it works.

Good for SOE maybe, but bad for SOE's players.
