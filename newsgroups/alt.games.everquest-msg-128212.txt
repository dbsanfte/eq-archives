Thats completly and utterly stupid.  Lets campaign for CCTV in the banks and

That seemed a really stupid thing to do... theres no logic in it at all imo.
Grats the "destroyers" level 20 monk twink?

Also what happens when one of them ebays and all his gear is stripped and
sold off?  I think we all know high end ebay happens, and the chars sell
fast.

Or what if they get some new monk recruits?

I can see why they would want all pairs to be accounted for, but how
realistic is that?

What happens when somebody trades/wins a pair on Stormhammer and moves back
to your server -  unaccounted for AoW pants is what (not just pants, but
anything upper end droppable)

How about, "I got them from legends..."

I don't believe that, sorry.

It doesnt take many brain cells to figure out that if your getting "hacked",
the first thing you do is unplug the modem.. heck hit the power PC switch if
you prefer.. you don't just sit there beg, not when it is in *your* control
to stop the attack.

He had a file on his machine listing all his different passwords in a text
file?

If it did indeed happen how he said it, I think something more went on that
he didn't tell you, or forgot to mention

I dont think it would be unrealistic to claim 85% of "hacked" accounts comes
as a direct result of account sharing and trading.  (And maybe 14% as a
result of trojans/pretend hack programs)

My r/l girlf gave somebody her password to help her with a camp because she
needed sleep, and I was furious... my gear she was using is now just sitting
on a mule unused (TS etc).. im not happy that its just wasting away.. but if
she gets fucked over by a scammer i don't want my stuff going with it (and
stuff thats just in my posession that i let her use)... of course thats
excluding the fact her 60 cleric on the same account is mostly geared up by
me.

It really really sucked ass.

I didn't want to waste my Dorf faction so I didn't kill GD dorfs (and only
took a faction hit on 1 Dain)..  instead I killed the evil dorfs in EW (no
faction, lvl 49ish mobs) to get their heads/hand them in.

2 weeks straight of killing them/handing heads in (including a frustrating
killing frenzy in GD which made me threatening) and I was finally warmly..
then a 2 day camp of Tormax (1 hour sleep in those 2 days).

On the Friday, left the comp at 6.10am (stayed in FD with chat log running..
so i'd know if he died)..  was back home from work and on the comp by
3.30pm.. scrolled up though my chat log, he died at 2.10pm to the servers
Aussie guild.  Ouch..

To be honest though, if you don't care about Coldain faction, 3 days or so
in GD killing the low level Dorfs in the mines will get enough heads to make
tormy give you the quest.

Btw handing in enough heads so that tormax quests with you (high amiable),
means your CoV faction has long before bottomed out (even from max ally)

So after I got the belt (and went LD just before tormy died /cry) It was
back to reverse factioning.. spent a few days in kael, was upto amiable with
dorfs.

Decided I would finally mq my armour stuffs...  Me: "Hail whateverquestmob"
Her: "I seek a magician.. are you one?"
Me: "i am a magician"
Her: "bla bla bla bring me.. yada yada and i will award you with [cap],
[boots], [robe] etc etc"

Ok so my faction is enough to do the MQ right.... bzzzt wrong.  She eat all
the items :(
Went up a faction level and it worked again..... I wasn't happy though

>     Huzzah! Now you must really be a solo machine, what with the extra
HPs,
> regen, and ATK. =)

Well yeah, except my waist was my current haste slot.  I spent the last week
of my dorf head pharming trying to buy a CoF (just something temporary until
I get a new slot 40% haste item)...

I dont intend on asking for something like Zlands haste cloak, its nodrop
and i would just bank it somewhere down the line - so I'll keep on trying to
buy something, unless a raid haste item drops that i'd really wear.

I have a tormy crown, so asking for a cowl isnt an option either

As for the extra hp/regen - it doesn't really effect my soloing ability, im
always running 1 of my cleric and shaman anyway.. so atm im only wearing it
on raids (obviously it makes a massive difference on raids)

The atk tho..  thats a very welcome soloing addition :)   When i can stomach
factioning again.. i will finish my sprit wracked quest for another AoB item
