That depends. How many different 8(9)-song combinations can you come up 
with out of your song book? :P

Ok, it's really not quite that crazy, but it really does depend on the 
situation. I have different lineups for:

Soloing - Chants, charm, invis, Selo's
Small Groups (2 or 3 people) - haste, slow, overhaste, CC
Full Groups - Geared for pulling usually, over-haste, buffs
Raids - Resists, over-cap-haste

That's a pretty common problem once you get to the point where you have 
more than eight very useful songs. Start by determining what your group 
is missing and load songs for that. Then balance it with songs to bail 
the group out of a jam as the situation warrants. For example, if the 
chanter in the group seems a bit suspect, I would keep mez and charm 
loaded, wheras if they are competent, I might forego them both for more 
buffs/debuffs and constant mana/hp songs. Also, if you're facing mobs 
that DoT, your poison/diseas cures can save a lot of HP and a lot of 
healer mana.

There really aren't too many "right" answers, which is at the same time 
one of the greatest and one of the most confusing things about the bard 
class. It almost always boils down to singing what the public wants/needs 
to hear.
