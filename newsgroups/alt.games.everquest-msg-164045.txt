    Blech, that sucks. Although the drop rate was a bit nutty. "Hey, guys,
come to this camp - we just got two parchments, one Spectral, off one easy
mob!"

    That was a needed bug fix, since people with no hope of clearing the
trials were "getting lucky" when previous groups didn't need all the runes
and left some in there. And Alasdair? The "top guilds" got through without
tricks, because they have the gear and the players to physically force
through anyone they want. Many of us even got all six runes, and not just
the one "easy" one!

    That I don't think will happen. The adjustments to XP have already
happened in the form of nerfing movement rate changes and the like. And ALL
the second tier planes and onward have this level of XP, not just Valor.

    Perhaps the model is to get some people far enough ahead to reveal stuff
that entices others to keep playing in the hope of someday doing those
things? I don't know if that works or not, but I'd guess that's the thought
processes.
