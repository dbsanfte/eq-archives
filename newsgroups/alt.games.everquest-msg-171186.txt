What are you smoking?

A group of 6 Shadow Knights could *NEVER* kill a Kunark dragon with
HT. 

The "nerfed" version of MB works *EXACTLY* the same as the old version
with 1 exception......Multiple Wizards cannot stack MB to fry a raid
level mob in seconds. It does the same amount of damage, and has the
same recyle time. The only thing Wizards lost was the ability to
trivialize the encounter and monopolize the zoot table. You can thank
"Team ManaBurn" and their greed for the nerf. The warnings went out
among the Wizard community long before Verant acted. Wizards brought
the change down upon themselves.

Wizards have to be 51+ with several AA points to acquire ManaBurn. (I
am not sure about the exact level or AA totals required) MB is not a
reward for playing a class that has a hard time finding groups. 

If you think pre-nerf manaburn was the only reason Wizards found
groups,  you are nuts. The only players hurt by the change were the
PL'd MB mules and Ebayed "Wizaards" that were used to get "phat
lewtz".
