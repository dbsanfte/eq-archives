What everyone else said.
If you stay with your guild, you have to wean them of the perception
that there will always be a porter available to take them every step
of the way. Arrange for a few pickup spots for each raid, and have
people get themselves to those spots. They can camp outside the
dungeon or run whatever distance to a more populated area (for
instance, Chardok is not all that far from KC). There's no law that
says they shouldn't have to get a port by paying a non guildie when
they are sucking all the fun from your game.
My guild has several porters, but we never babysit the others beyond
reason.  If they want a ride, they are expected to be at a convenient
spot, and they don't flinch from getting a port from a stranger.
