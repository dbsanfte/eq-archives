I walked through Kithicor at night once.  Used Invis VS. Undead.  All sots
of undead that conned red and yellow to me.  A few white and blue.  They
were not too scary because they were indif.  The problem was the hounds.
Most of the hounds conned white that I saw, but they were THREATENINGLY!!!
All it would take is for one of those hounds to hit me and my Invis to
Undead would be gone, then I would have had everything on me.

Now during the day, Kithicor is not bad.  Night is the problem.

> NK - 1 (stupid griffawn... "But it was green!")
> EK - 2 (CR from the griffawn, stupid spiders and hounds)

The Commonlands are a bit nasty too.  Walking along with a L14 druid so we
could go to Rivervale and get her SoW Gix killed us both.  Those NPC you
forgot about, never knew about, etc. can be more dangerous than Kithicor,
but that is because I know how nasty Kith is, and take proper care.
