Oh there is no way at all I would donate for that, I can't think of almost
any circumstance I would donate for a buff I did not ask for, perhaps if it
was something really usefull and I didn't get a greedy tell over it etc...
The couple times it did happen I was relatively new still (more new than I
am now...) and didn't want to rock the boat so just lied that I was broke if
I rememeber correctly. If they did it now I think I would start by just
igrnoring the tell. not sure what I'd do if they had the balls to persist.
