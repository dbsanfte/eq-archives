So you have to kill not just the klacknicks but also the fire beetles?
That's my mistake. I was bypassing the fire beetles and moving
straight to the klacknicks.

Will give that a shot later and see if that brings her out.

BTW: Someone else said she splits into two after you kill her. Are
those two at lvl 7-10 or two at a lower level? I'd hate to think I
killed a lvl 10, just to have to face two level 10s in exchange!!
