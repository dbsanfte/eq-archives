This is a luxury spell for me.. I use it if it looks like the tanks in the
group can't taunt enough to get aggro off a mezzed mob for example. But that
is about it.

Actually I have used RuneIV on some occassions when raiding and having to
break in a tough room, Royals in Chardok comes to mind..

I always clarity, brilliance, insight, gom all pure casters and often
hybrids too if they ask for it.. Hybrid always get clarity but not always
the other mana/stat buffs.

at

    This is zone dependent for me. About the only time I use it if there are
damage shields to be dispelled. Aside from that this is a backburner spell.


> Tash (lower MR)

 Almost all the time.. Again zone dependent but it usually finds a place in
the lineup.

> Tepid Deeds (slow)

    If you don't have a shammy in the group go for it. I also use this if
there isn't a cleric around, so prime healers are druids or shammy's. This
will reduce damage and help them stretch their healing mana out.

    I have played with this some in KC and a couple other dungeons where you
can have multiple adds and a nice little mezz parking lot. I am not that
impressed with it's effects. If you do use it, I would recommend using the
AOE one when you get it...


> AoE Mez (for those "ADD!!!  ADD!!!, (repeat as needed <grin>)!" pulls.
> Chain cast it.

    Almost never use it. I don't particularly find it that usefull unless I
am pl'ing someone. The low duration of the spell and the fact that regular
mezz won't overwrite it makes this one a non-starter for me.

> Enthrall (Mez -- single target).  For the single Add situation.

    Always, always, always.

    I agree completely.. But if things are going smoothly and I have mana to
burn I will toss a nuke in for fun sometimes.. Often from my swap slot.

    I use haste spells almost exclusively on all melee classes in the group.
I know it is a pain and and a mana dump but that will improve as you level.
I know it is only a 10% increase but that is per melee. All that extra
damage adds up quickly. In raid situations I will use aug, but in my guild
being 51 I am often the backup mezzer/clarity person as we have 2 other
awesome encs that I am learning a great deal from.

    I would get used to managing the mana dump from the pure haste spells,
because at 39 you will get celerity that is a base 47% haste and Swift like
the Wind later that is a base 60% haste iirc. These are clearly superior to
aug and most melees will start expecting them.

    The larger the group, ie more melee types, the bigger difference the 10%
per melee will make.

    Not at all, you have to look at the capabilities of each spell and
measure the cost/benefit analysis. Some of this can also be a matter of play
style also.

    Hrmm I don't really buff that much as an enc. It isn't really your job,
outside of traditional haste/mana buff duties that is. Most clerics know the
value of keeping the Enchanter alive. Ask THEM to buff you with the rest of
the party. A cleric that doesn't want too is one that I wouldn't group with
in the future. Their buffs are better anyway.

    I will toss out infra,ultra sympatheic aura if requested but I wll not
offer them. Again this is a swap slot area.

    On the subject of buffs, I didn't notice it but I assume that you are
always keeping your shielding spell on you? It stacks with just about
everything and can really make a difference at higher levels.

    Once again a matter of playing styles. Most parties in my experience
don't really ask for the extra buffs. I save my mana for other more pressing
duties.

    Don't know yet. Haven't really used them much at all yet.

    If you are going to use it I would definitely use a hotkey for aoe mezz.
Communication is a great thing in enchanters.

    I don't have a problem with it, but then again I hardly ever use it. I
generally expect the cleric to be able to loot some to recover reagent
expenses, so I don't see an issue with you doing it.

Just for giggles here is my standard spell loadout at 51.

1. Clarity
2. Swift like the Wind
3. Boon of the Garou
4. Theft of Thought (in caster heavy areas, if not insert nuke or slow)
5. AoE stun
6.Charm (if there are resistable mobs, ie giants, wurms etc, if not add
either another aoe stun or slow/nuke)
7.Mezz (dazzle)
8.Swap slot

    I usually keep root in my swap slot, but that is where all my utility
spells go. I hate only having one slot but I usually have enough to do that
i need all the space I can. I use this spot ALOT but I can't think of any
alternatives without giving up some capability.

    Just doing this off the top of my head so I hope it makes sense :>
