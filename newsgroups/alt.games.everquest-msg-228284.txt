Unfortunately it's not that simple.

They need all of that and good (or excellent) equipment. Because the only
ways they have of getting aggro are Taunt, raw damage and procs.

Given that Taunt fails, they are left relying on raw damage (insufficient)
and procs (too random) for aggro.

Many classes have become used to knight/ranger-level aggro and will
overnuke, or slow early, or in general ignore the limitations that
the warrior has to deal with. Then when they get aggro, it's naturally
blamed on the warrior.

The best warrior in the world is going to have trouble getting aggro
if taunt fails, their hate procs refuse to go off, and the wizard
lets go with a 5k crit nuke.
