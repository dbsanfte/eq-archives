A friend of mine is going to be starting off in the vast world of norrath
soon and im going to show him around. The only thing i have never understood
is XP off a mob. What i mean by that is if he hits it to 50% then i kill it,
does he get 100% of the XP? Obviously everything he attacks will be very
very green to me, and we wouldnt be grouped.

Any one got any ideas on this? I've also heard its 75% before you kill it to
let the first attacker get all the xp.

Im only going to PL to around 10 or so but any advice would be great.

Cheers
