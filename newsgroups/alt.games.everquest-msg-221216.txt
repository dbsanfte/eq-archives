I cant tell you not to try it, but dont cancel your EQ account and say no to
all the CIHYS.  :)  Like Georg said, the game is too easy to master and
their is no real content to keep anyone entertained.  Our guild was waiting
years for this game, and they quit within the first couple weeks.

I myself am a master architect.  Its basically a chore to log on each day
and complete orders and stock my vendors.  Then once a week I am moving
resource harvestors since the resources shift.  And to master Artisan,
Architect, and some merchant I have almost no skill points left to put into
melee skills.  And you can only have 1 character per account, so I am
basically just a crafter and dont/cant do anything else unless I wanna give
up that skill but the game doesnt offer me anything to waste my time doing
that.
