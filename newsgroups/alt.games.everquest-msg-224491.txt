I wasn't expecting him to play guard.  That would imply I pulled my critters
over to him yelling for help because I wanted to keep the kills.  Or that I
expected him to help me level or do kills for me.

That's not the case.

He walked over to where *I* was battling them, and watched me fail gate/root
after gate/root while being beaten on (kept getting interrupted), while my
pet died, while I was yelling and asking for help.  Plus he was hunting the
same thing I was, and I was offering him a tashed, debuffed, 75% mob for the
taking--a very easy kill for him, if he'd just make it easier for me to get
out.  Heck, I wanted to gate, so he would've also been left with an
almost-20% mob he could've likely taken out with one good nuke.

I find it hard to believe he was so afraid of being called a KSer that he'd
let me die while I was pleading for help.

And I doubt he wasn't interfering because he didn't want to draw agro.  He
was right by them/me, so the second I was gone, they would've turned on him.
