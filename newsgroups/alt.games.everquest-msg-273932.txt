I disagree.

The EULA is a contract you knowingly agreed to. By violating it, you
say, very clerly and distinctly, "I do not honour contracts." In my
world, that makes you a bad person -- dishonourable and untrustworthy.

Only a fool would do business with a person who openly admits they do
not consider contracts morally or legally binding.
