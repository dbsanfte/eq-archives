Totally agree with you! Forget about the bugs I'm having to deal with -- at
least those will be worked out, but I'm on a 900Mhz TBird / 512MB / 32MB
Graphics and everything's 3 times slower, not to mention zoning and just
getting into the game! It reminds me of the Pool of Radience days on my C-64
and 300KB floppy disks. But then there was a reason for the slowness... now
10+ years later, still slow! haha!

Gameplay severely suffers for marginally enhanced graphics! What a shame!!
