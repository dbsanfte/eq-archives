The only intelligent person I have heard so far is the one that asked the
moron to killfile hiim.
Please add me to the killfile list as well.

Do you jerks work for Verant or something?

Wbrownlee, Dark Tyger, Bizbee....You folk are so obviously either young
and/or dumb.
You must hate yourselves since you hate stupidity so much.

I don't post to this group often but I do appreciate the help given by
others.
None of you gives any real help. You just seem to live for an opportunity to
bitch out somebody else.

Heres your chance.
And....I have reproduced and my kids are the ones kicking your butts
mentally in school and in physically in sports. All in the genes baby.
I doubt any of yours will survive without government assistance.

The last line was mean, I agree. True but still mean. The more advanced have
a duty to protect the less capable.

BTW -- you are all in my killfile now. That was a good idea. Please add me
to yours so that there will be less opportunity for our paths to cross
again.
