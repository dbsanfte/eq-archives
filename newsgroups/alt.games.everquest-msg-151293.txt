   I don't play the high end game yet, but this strikes me complete BS. 
How dependent are high level clerics on pickup groups?  Hell, I'm only
34, and I could pretty much always group with guildees and friends I've
made, and this is on FV, one of the lowest population servers.  My
friends would NOT kick me out of a full group because a_random_druid_049
came up and asked if they could have a spot, or /shout LFG.  And were I
to go to a zone and /shout LFG, I doubt that many groups who are lacking
healing powers would huddle together and say "Naw, let's hold out for a
druid!".

Can I have thier stuff?  
  Really, I hope the person that left pretty much on the verge of
leaving anyways, since this seems like a very petty reason to storm out
in a huff.
