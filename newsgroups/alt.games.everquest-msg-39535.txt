    Are you saying that the only fun to be had in all of EQ is in
discovering something new? If so, you'll be pretty damn disappointed if you
are a regular reader of Allakhazam's.

    If you didn't mean that, then here's the next question: the zone is
still there. Nobody's there. Why aren't those people who COULD get XP there?
Is it because they zone in to get the phat lewt, get their asses handed to
them by a train-happy zone filled with all sorts of "mistake mobs" like
ENCHANTER goblins, and run away never to return? Naw, it must be those high
levels!

<rant>

    So you want to lock us out of a zone like Runnyeye. Then you want us to
come pull your corpses, to res you, to buff you, and to sell you cheap gear
that you can't go get because, having been raised outdoors for so many
levels you just don't have a clue how to deal with mobs you can't safely
Fear. Well guess what - we can't go get you that gear, so YOU can now suffer
through the "rusty weapon and patchwork" stages WE went through, and
re-learn the entire game. No, no more easy EC deals for you - YOU want to
earn your gear! OK, deal!

    YOU can run around half the time you're on EQ, going from place to place
to camp the one item in game that'll improve you in some way which you
theoretically COULD camp. YOU can wait in line at that camp, competing with
everyone else your level that also has to squeeze in that camp before they
advance beyond it. YOU can watch other folks roll on stuff you really
wanted, and take it away from you so you're forced to sit there LONGER to
get what you want. YOU can feel the effects of twinking more than you ever
have before, as twinks come in and do those camps you need with half your
numbers because the item drops are more valuable. Then, once you level past
a camp you feel is required, YOU can make an alt, level them up to the
camp's level, and do this all over again! And remember - can't do any of
this without a group, so I hope you made friends that always play when you
do if you don't like pickup groups with morons! Welcome to EverCamp!

    THAT was EQ before Kunark. IT SUCKED. People packed like sardines into
what few "good" zones there were, bitching in ooc over and over about "you
stole my frog" because there only WAS the one frog up, or being slaughtered
in one of the known "death trap" zones and spending half their online time
running towards another CR. Since then, a better system has evolved - lower
levels get to advance in whatever zone they feel like they're capable of
taking, not worrying about gear since they can purchase gear with the plat
that drops almost everywhere. Who gets that gear? It's hand-me-downs from
older characters, and gear harvested by farmers. You are FREE of EverCamp -
and yet you want to go back. Well, enjoy sitting staring at the same wall in
some dungeon somewhere, hoping you can get the Foozzle of Mediocrity before
you ding and get thrown out of the camp.

    James, who's only ever camped his epic mobs and has the gear to prove
it.
