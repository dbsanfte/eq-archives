Not sure at all why you suggest XP Pro.  I have ran both Win98, Win2K
and XP.  The only time I had any issues was when I was using win98
machine as my NAT router.  If he has a router that does NAT, he would
just setup his computer to do DHCP.  
My present environment has a 4 port Router, 16 port switch, and
anywhere from 4 - 10 PC's up and running on it all setup with Windows
2K, and DHCP.

Why do you say he will have connectivity issues with anything but XP?
