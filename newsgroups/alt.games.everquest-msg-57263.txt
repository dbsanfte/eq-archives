*laughs* Wow.  Did you remind them that:

1. Actually, the game is produced in the United States, and
2. In the UK alone, there are several languages spoken, including multiple
Gaelic dialects and Welsh.  Hell, the UK has Welsh language television.
Most of the schoolchildren speak passable French or German. . .

*shakes her head*  I'm glad I stayed on E'Ci.  I'd been tempted to move to
the Euro server so I wouldn't have to hear as much war rhetoric.

> Am I the only one who sees this as a very bigoted and europhile approach?

Europhile, no.  Anglophile, probably (or more like Anglophoniphilic, because
it's preference for English speakers -- heh).  It's extremely stupid.

I'm an American, and I play on E'Ci.  During the day, we've got a pretty big
Japanese population, as well as a small group of French players.  I slept
through a year of French language in High School. . .I can communicate
passably when it comes to "Where is the zone line" or "Hello, how are you
doing?"  The Japanese players are more of a challenge (because I've never
seen the client display kanji), but I'm (slowly) learning the transliterated
words they use so that I can ask for help, or give it.

Usually, in EC (where I've seen this most often), there is an overall
tolerance in during the day (when most Americans like myself should be at
work).  I've seen it peak at about 1/3 other language, 2/3 English (athough
the bank in Freeport is nearly 4/5 Japanese language in the mornings, and WC
sometimes goes heavily other language as well).  After about 4 or 5 PM, the
kiddies and their bigot parents get on and make a stink about the whole
thing.  After then, I usually only see Japanese in /tells or /says.

Not always.  I've caught someone calling me nasty things in French before.

OTOH, you're right overall, and people really should grow up and learn to
filter out people speaking other languages.  The only time it offends me is
when a person moves from Country A to Country B, only speaks Language A, and
expects everyone in Country B to accomodate her.  EverQuest is a game, and
if you've got decent access, you can play it.  It doesn't matter where you
live, or what language you speak.  It HELPS if you speak a bit of English,
but that's sort of the case all over the West. . .

I've kidnapped one of your countrymen.  Rest assured that he is fed and
comfortable.  *grin*

There's a tremendous degree of arrogance that comes with speaking English.
For Americans, it's largely borne of ignorance, because we (as a people)
don't seem to think that there's much of a world outside our borders.  For
the English, it's partly carried over from the days of The Empire. . .and
overall, you guys are much nicer about the whole thing than we are. 8)
