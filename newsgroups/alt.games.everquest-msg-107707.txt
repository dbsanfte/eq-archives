Irrelevant. He *told* us his petition. It was clear. Maybe he was
lying about it but I don't tend to assume that as default case.


>The problem is the writer/customer. Remember this is a one sentence

It didn't. What part of him giving us the text of the petition didn't
you understand?

If you can't figure out what "help I'm under the world" means you
don't belong in EQ CS.

There is never 200 petitions, and the times it even gets over 20 are
really busy primetime or times when there is zero or one person just
on. We know for a fact from the example there were at least two.

And, sorry to say, but the CS rules explicitly tell you its more
important to treat one person well than 10 people badly.

Because they didn't?

Or are you making the mistake of taking a single example and assuming
I extend it to every guide? Read for comprehension.

    people die. You are selling things which make people die, but not
    only do they just die, they also become addicted to your product
    for tens of years before they die, thereby supplying you with
