Well first, the hasted pet will easily outdamage an average xp group of
L65s.  It wont outdamage a 65 group in the best gear around and with
300AAs per, but most xp groups at 65 arent made up of players like that.

As for the charm breaking, yeah it bites when it breaks, although
Enchanters are not completely defenseless when this happens.  Most of
them deal with this problem by partnering with a druid or another snare
capable class, or by having a snare bot.

This is also easily dealt with by having a partner.  Or you can also
work your fights so that after 1-2 mobs are down to your pet, you allow
your pet to get within an inch of its life as your final target dies and
then you break charm and kill your pet.  Its really easy to do once you
get the hang of it, especially since lots of stuff enrages.

Sorry but I dont feel at all sorry for them.  I agree with you they get
beat down in a hurry if things go wrong, but death in PoP is really not
much of an issue, especially to the post 65 crowd.  Resses are easy to
come by, and worst case you are losing 6%xp which translates into 30% of
AA.  So in the ultra rare case when you have to eat a death (has yet to
happen to me in PoP) you lose a trivial amount of xp and almost no down
time at all.

As a class they are good soloers, and with CoD they can do stuff that
full groups w/o charm flat out cant do.  Charm is overpowered for this
reason.  As for druids having less ability to solo at low risk...come
on.  They have SoE, snare and root.  Druids can make xp in an uncrowded
PoStorms faster than almost anyone.  They can quad kite just fine in
lots of zones.  They can aggro kite with a DC pet in a lot of zones.
They can root cook if they feel like taking it easy.  Oh and they can
port themselves around at will looking for a spot to hunt.  No, I dont
feel sorry for them either.

Well I cant think of anything to say to this except that you are wrong.
Solo classes make xp faster solo/duoing than groups do.  What is the
fastest you have ever made an AA?  A Necro soloing in HoH can make 1 an
hour in 4-5 spots and you dont need an uber rare charm spell to do it or
exceptional gear.  I have never been in a full group that can come close
to that pace...the closest would be a PoV caves group that has all the
cave spawns to themselves (which is real rare in my experience, as there
is almost always a group outside the caves), and even that isnt even an
AA in 2 hours.

Back to the point, the high level PoP charms allow 2-3 players, as long
as at least one has charm, to do things that 2 groups of players w/o
charm cant do.  Thats not balanced IMO.
