One of my favorite seasonings is a bottle of Ass in Space (so called 
because its hotter than its predecessor, Ass in a Tub); a few drops in a 
meal are adequate to render it hot enough that I only use it when I'm in 
the mood for seriously spicy food.

Ingrediants list:
Cayenne Pepper
Water
Salt
Acetic Acid
Oleoresin Cayenne
Starch
Caramel Color.

Active ingrediant then, is buried 5 deep (assuming the ingrediants are 
in order by volume).

This is still so hot that I don't use it often, and when I do its in 
small quantities... that suggests that I'm really using one drop or less 
of the Oleoresin Cayenne itself.

Nonetheless, I've experienced the sensation, the next morning, that 
caused them to name the stuff Ass In Space.

Why wasn't that on your list of side effects?  At any rate, if your 
target manages to swallow, there's another bit of fun revenge you can 
imagine for yourself... its an astonishingly painful surprise and unlike 
the one in your mouth, there's very little you can do about it.  Milk 
enema maybe?

ps wash hands with soap, after handling bottle.  I just noticed myself 
doing so out of habit, after checking the ingrediants list.  Don't want 
to wipe my eye or blow my nose or anything without cleaning up first.
