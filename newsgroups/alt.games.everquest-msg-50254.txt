the EQ economy is in a permanent recession it seems.  the prices on
everything is just getting lower and lower in terms of how much things cost.
Things do get a shot in the arm with new items constantly being available.
People in the games are creating new chars and wanting new equipment so
there is some demand.  The supply of items being available seems to be the
deciding factor.  there are more items available than demand warrants, the
the driving force of prices getting lower so demand will pick up.  Its
definitely a buyer's market in EQ.  It seems that if you wait you will get
items for less price later down the road when people get frustrated that an
item just isn't selling.

I was tossing around ideas for ways to fix this problem, like making more
banking institions to lend money so people who want to spend money can,
while people who save money can lend it to people who want to spend it.
Thus the money keeps flowing, raising demand.

Another possiblity to fix this problem would be to tag new equipment to
degrade over time/usage.

if you have any thoughts on this subject, post them

it might seem silly now, but imagine your uber items that are droppable
being worth a quarter of what they are worth now in a year or two.
