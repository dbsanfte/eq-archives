In EQ2, I would exploit said bug until I racked up a huge (but not
suspiciously huge) sum of in-game money. Then, I would sell my
"ill-gotten" gains on ebay for large sums of real world cash. Then, I
would repeat this process until a less intelligent person reported this
bug or SoE caught on and banned me. I would then take all of my real
world cash and buy myself something nice, like a new sofa.

It's not my job or moral obligation to play Quality Assurance for any
company, especially when I'm a paying customer, and especially not if
it's in my real world financial interests not to.
