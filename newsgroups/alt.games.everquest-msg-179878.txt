Yep.  Look at what levels the BL gets an 'upgraded' pet - those levels
and the next few are truly incredible for soloing.  However... right
now my BL is 38 - have had the same pet since 29.  Solo'ing is a bit
more problematic.  I have to be much choosier.  But 39 is just around
the corner, then the new pet spell and all will be better.

And I completely agree with the "getting bored? Start a new alt"
approach.  If I didn't do that I'd be long gone.
