Neither. I've reread my posts going back up this thread, and I can't 
find a post where I asserted that you should pre-empt misunderstanding 
by -stating your real life gender first-.

I have said that you shouldn't perpetrate misconceptions, as that is 
deceptive. But merely advising them in no uncertain terms that they are 
dealing with a female elf, and to make no assumptions about the player 
behind it would suffice.

In fact I've stated this quite clearly previously elsewhere in this 
thread last night:

/quote:
I'm not saying you have to say hey I'm a guy, and I'm married/single, 
and have kids/pets... simply saying "/g ooc: I'm role-playing a female 
elf, and that's who you are interacting with. Don't assume *anything* 
about me." would clearly dilineate the boundary that needs to be drawn 
for people who are responding inappropriately to a roleplayed elf.

You don't have to lie to them, and you don't have to disclose personal 
information either.
/end quote

I'll concede its possible I've said something somewhere that has been 
misunderstood, or perhaps even a poor expression of my thoughts; feel 
free to provide the quote that you are paraphrasing.
