To clarify, the level 32 manasong, Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity will
stack with as many bards as you can stick in a group.  It is iconless,
but each pulse it gives 7 mana.  This is about the same rate as with
enchanter clarity.  So with 5 bards singing it and one lucky caster
you are getting basically 35 mana per tick.  It also stacks with any
of the catatas, though none of the catatas stack with themselves.
The level 34 Catata of Soothing has an icon, and gives about 5 mana
per tick, but can be twisted since the icon lasts for about 9 seconds.
It's stacks fine with Chorus of Clarity.  
The level 55 Catata of Replenishment also has an icon, gives about 11
mana per tick, and can also be twisted.  (I've seen this listed at 12
mana per tick on Reed's Spreadsheet, but since I've found several
minor errors with Reeds, I'll use Maravana's numbers.)  It stacks fine
with Chorus of Clarity.  It is almost exactly the same regen as C2.
All bard mana songs stack with all enchanter mana buffs.
I got this information from the very, very good presentation at
http://eqsongs.com/Songs/clarity_timings.htm

Yeah, and for each point you put in you get 1 mana/tick, not that much
really.  I guess after 5 levels of exp you get almost to the level of
perma-clarity.  Now if it worked for bards I might actually consider
it, 80 minutes to FM after a rez bites geonids.

I thought that FTx gave x mana per tick.  

Arolpin
mana, is it ever useful?
