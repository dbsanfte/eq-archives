About as decent as the ranger / monk's tanking abilities.  (Quite a bit
better than the wizard's.)

Not the person you would want doing the job, probably, but they can get it
done all the same in many situations.

And exactly what part of "having a few extra warriors there" precludes
having a second MT assigned?  Or a third, or a fourth.

And why the fuck would they do that?

If things are going wrong (that was the point, remember?  recovering from a
fucked up start, mid-raid fuckups, whatever) you could easily have the
second and / or third tanks dead from rampage, or bad aggro control, or
whatever.  Thus the button, let the healers know that you have to take it
over since you are next.  What if all 2, 4 or whatever warriors that were
assigned to the tanking order are dead?   You see that it's going to hell
and hit that.  It may not be the perfect solution, but it's probably your
best shot at recovery at that point.

What happens when your wizard decides epic rune is enough to tank X ubermob,
so he goes over and stands next to the healers (since he thinks that heals
cast faster when they dont' have to travel as far) and chain nukes as the
pull comes in?    Maybe we shouldn't add extra wizards then.   I mean, hell,
as long as you're using examples that require people to be complete idiotic
fuckwits for them to ever happen...
