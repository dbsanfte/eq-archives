Well... Hell, I guess you nailed it. :) When I read stories of
Enchanters doing amazing feats of crowd control and turning horrible
overpulls into an XP firehose, I feel I just don't have the ability to
do that. I did try grouping a few levels ago at the entrance of
Permafrost, and apply all the good Enchanter techniques I had read about
in the NG, but there was little point, as I just couldn't stop the
warriors attacking the mobs I had mesmerized, or to stop ex-charmed gobs
from chewing me up.

I'll probably try what you suggested. I'm familiar with LOIO from my
Druid, and it's a relatively safe if you have SoW. Not hard to
outdistance mobs.

Thanks!
