Yes it was.   The spawn was constantly repopping.  There was simple no way
he could be kept dead by just 1 guild.

This was at the point of the buggy AE, and the gm's /killing him... 2
weekends ago?

Grats on not being a loot whore.  I don't think im one either (raiding 5days
a week, all the hassles of leading them, 3-4 loots in the last 3 months,
whilst the average persons loot at our current farm rate is 1-2 major items
a week)

That doesn't change the fact loot is a MAJOR incentive for guilds..  every
guild.  Not necessarily every individual member (a guild with 100% loot
whores would be amusing to see...) but the guild as a whole, has a focus on
loot.. of course it does, its called advancement.

Farm the mobs with the uber stuff...  skip the lame loot mobs once flags are
done

1 voice of reason is lost in 100 voices of whiney insulting flames.

As a neutral I thought the general theme was flames and snipes, particularly
the stuff from you guys (who are the only ones "effected" by what happened).
