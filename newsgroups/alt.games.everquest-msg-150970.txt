ST key is extremely easy to get now.   Statue is one of the most trivial
Velious mobs, the fact Vindi was dropping it (I believe its now a super
rare) and he repops every 8 hours, shows what a joke it is.

Anyway kill Tormax, Statue, or a first brood dragon : lendi in tov, Sont and
Kland in ww, zland in DN, yeli in SS

If you have a jaled tomb key, then open the door and simply hand in your
talisman for an ST key.

Its not tough, and it sure as hell aint long.
