Thanks for all the positive posts and well-wishing!

I just hit Level 5 yesterday with my Druid, and now I can remember her
name :)  It's Tyenae (I just like the female models, not a pervert :)
).  I got some more kind souls who gave me some leather armor pieces
and a tarnished warhammer -- great for pummelling bad guys with.  I
know it's not much in the grand scheme, but seeing my AC climb over
120 was a big thrill, so was getting Gate and Summon Lightning.  Can't
wait to get Spirit of Wolf and Levitate -- no more falling out of
trees in my home city.

I know "only" 5 levels in a week is slow to a lot -- I found one
character (a dwarf, probably warrior of some sort I'm guessing) played
by an 11 year-old boy (he's the one who helped me wander the tree-city
and gave me the armor) who managed level 31 in less than three weeks! 
It only made it worse to realize an 11 year-old knows the game far,
far better than I probably will, and I'm almost three times his age :)
 I kid, he was a great help to me, and once he was done helping me, he
ran off to help other newbies.  His father owns the guild he was in (I
can't remember the name), from what he told me, and should be proud
his son is so generous and kind to others.

I am getting a commercial copy of Legacy today (and for those who
wondered, Everquest Gold comes with all the expansions EXCEPT LoY) for
the maps and added bank space.

It's still a great time all around, running around not knowing where
things are, finding new monsters and areas (like the spires that
teleport you, that was neat).  I've got 57pp saved from kills and
generous adventurers and I think I might try a journey to the bazaar
soon for some of the items mentioned.

Again, thank you all for your advice, support, and kind words.
