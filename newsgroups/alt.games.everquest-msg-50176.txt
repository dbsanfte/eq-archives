I eventually want SS and giant faction and that will take a while. Well
right now I want that bracer so i don't have to worry about arrows anymore.
Is there anyway to charm kale to get the quest started and done? I know you
could do it with other mobs but I have heard a lot of different things about
the vellious quest mobs. Anyone know anything solid?

Thanks
