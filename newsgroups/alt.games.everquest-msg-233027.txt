I have heard of dhcp compatibility snafus before, with various routers
that needed firmware to fix,, but you can freeze up predictably, and
quickly... so its not likely a dhcp lease renewal issue.

What icons. in what sections, do you have in your "Network
Connections" window?

What is the LAN ip of your gateway?
What ip address is your router giving to your computer?

Have you done *any* tweaking of the default router settings?
Do you perchance have *anything* else on the network... (e.g. a
printer?)

Do you have any protocols other than tcp/ip bound to your network
adapter?

You'd said you got this thing so your friends could share the
connection; have you tried unplugging yourself, and letting one of
them try it... same problem??

When the internet  'locks up' is the activity light blinking wildy or
is it dead?
