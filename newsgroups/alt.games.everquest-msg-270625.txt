To each his (or her) own with games.

One thing I find a bit puzzling it how you want quests to tell you exactly 
what to do, specific locations etc.  That would seem to me to detract a lot 
from the concept of questing.

I have a level 26 character based in Qeynos, and have done something like 
210 quests, with another 35 in my journal.  Only in a few of these quests 
have I had trouble locating NPC's or where/what/how of it.  I'm not a 
particularly patient person either.  I think one or two of those quests you 
don't like, I saw immediately for what they were - quests that let you get 
to know the zone, and have an actual reward base to it.

You have 5 quests in your journal and you can't remember where some of them 
originated?  You must have a poor memory then, as each quest gives the zone 
in which it began, with the NPC name, and a summary in the journal - almost 
all the time this is plenty for me to recall where that particular NPC is 
(if the journal doesn't mention their occupation/location in the zone 
anyway).  I also like how some of the quests have a puzzle/riddle element to 
it (for example - one involves finding the ever vigilant cyclops in 
Antonica, which is the lighthouse).

I quite like the questing system as it is - there is always some kind of 
quest, of varying types, to do - and I've never felt overburdened or lost 
with it (I've never written anything down, only gone from the journal as 
well).  I also don't want everything handed to me on a silver platter - I 
WANT to have to work some things out on my own, to do *some* exploring - I 
feel this is integral to the whole idea of questing.  No system is perfect, 
no system will suit everyone, and there are some smaller issues with the 
quest system, but overall I like it.

As I said though, to each his own.  If you don't enjoy it then you don't, 
and if WoW's easier style suits you, then thats great :)

There ARE a couple of major issues I have with EverQuest 2 though, mainly 
relating to the technical side of things.  It needs a beefy system to run it 
well at medium settings, and even so it is still not optimized (my 6800GT, 
made by nVidia who are a sponser, hardly breaks a sweat as GPU temp rises 
only a few degrees at most - meaning something is stopping full utilization 
of the graphics card).  There is a rather major memory leak in game, so 
after a couple hours or more in the game, performace starts to degrade a 
lot, especially if you are moving around lots of zones.  EverQuest 2 code in 
general is not as polished as World of Warcraft (which I guess everyone was 
expecting).

However, none of these are showstopping things, and 95% of the time my 
gaming experience is fine.

"It seems that all characters have to go through nearly exactly the same 
steps to get further in the game" ... "It seems that the basic plotline 
should differ for different character types.  Perhaps that occurs at higher 
levels than I have been, which admittedly is not very far."

You have (obviously) never got to the class progression levels (10 & 20) so 
I guess I can fill you in a bit here.  As a mage going to summoner at (10), 
and especially going to conjuror at 20 the tasks for progression were very 
related to the class (for example as a conjuror I had to combat the four 
different elementals as part of my quest.  As a scout as part of it I had to 
sneak my way through a tavern with brigands to find and kill their leader. 
Not huge diversity but are related to the class.  The whole point of the 
system is that players don't have to make the BIG choices (which of the 24 
different classes they want to play) at the start.  Most will know if they 
want a mage, priest, scout or fighter type of character, but not 
specifically what.  I think it makes sense this way (as far as class based 
systems go)

I've never played World of Warcraft, but have heard it is a very polished 
game, very stylized and varied throughout with a good questing system.  What 
could be worrying about the game though, is that I've heard from more 
experienced gamers who have a gripe about the lack of depth in the game. 
Players reached their maximum level in under 2 weeks, and already there are 
tonnes of max level players; these players also discover a lack of depth in 
the game, especially from a PvE (player vs environment) perspective; PvP has 
some serious issues and is not fully developed.  Note that this is just what 
I've heard, as I dont' play myself.

To sum up my response to your post:
You are obviously looking for a PvE game, as EQ2 has none and was a game you 
were considering - so from a PvE perspective:

WoW: Runs well on many systems, with a unique look.  Very polished, fun and 
varied for new players.  Questing system detailed and informative, with many 
to do.  Game lacks depth at higher levels.  Community (from what I've heard) 
is not so good, with a lot of the battle.net idiots on it.

EQ2: Needs beefy system, very high end graphics sometimes on par with latest 
FPS games.  Not so polished, but few showstopping bugs. Questing system 
detailed and varied, hundreds to do - requires more (memory) from the player 
though.  More depth (in content & encounters) throughout the game.  More 
group oriented playstyle than WoW.  Community is better than WoW, but not 
that great, certainly not very communicative - neither have that real 
community feel that EQ1 has (yet).  Probably more PvE potential than WoW 
(both technical - we haven't seen all this engine can do, and content wise). 
Of course, if you want PvP, then you have to go WoW :p (or Lineage 2, or 
DAOC or etc etc etc)

(There is of course a lot more I could have wrote here, but I just thought 
I'd respond to your points with my own opinion :)
