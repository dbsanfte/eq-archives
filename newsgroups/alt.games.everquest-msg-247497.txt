I think that's a legal convenience more than anything else. Banning 
'people' is harder.

And more importantly, EULA or no, this would like the police arresting 
people owning the guns used in crimes instead of the people using guns 
in crimes. There's something obviously wrong with that, even if it is 
'easier'.

Naive is innocence... its related but not quite what im shooting for. At 
any rate it would be a good addition to my string of adjectives :)

Yup.

Even so, I betcha the guys at Allakhazams, PlayerAuctions, and a zillion 
other places have countless user/password combos at their disposal.

Yes its probably acceptable to interpret the do not give out your 
password to mean do not reuse it elsewhere...

But the average joe has never performed the mental connect-the-dots to 
realize that reusing the password elsewhere does in fact give access to 
others. Many people have this blind faith that passwords are magically 
encrypted so that even owners of the host computers can't look at them 
(and if they do... they only think the owner could look at their 
account... something the owners already have access too so why would 
they need your password... it never dawns what would happen if they 
spammed that combination anywhere else)

So in their minds, EULA or no, reusing the password for other personal 
accounts doesn't figure in as giving it to anybody else. I really don't 
think one should be banned for such naivete. (thanks for the word)
