Yay!

much more critical

Not exactly. . .  DSL is a constant connection, and you're essentially on a
big LAN.  What this means is that you'll want to read up on Windows security
settings and ensure that you're not set up to do things that could make life
difficult.  The two things that come to mind are sharing (file/printer) and
being a server (and you can be a server and not know it).  I highly suggest
going to Microsoft and having a look at the critical updates, etc., as well
as having a look in their security section.  Most worms and "hack attacks"
can be largely prevented by good PC security!  Also, remember to MAINTAIN
your machine by running critical updates!

We were DSL, and then moved and had to switch to cable.  I have no
connection issues.

Erm, we have a separate firewall running FreeBSD.  8)
