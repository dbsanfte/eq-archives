People's initial responses to her post - mine included, which I invite
anyone to go back and check - were very reasonable in tone.
Surprisingly so, given her statement: "Most ..[necromancers].. I've
found want to nuke the hell out of mobs, waste their mana... and not
be supportive of the group."

Crucially, though, we didn't *completely* agree with her, and that
won't do, not in "Chorkie World".

Thereafter, she upped the ante. Her attitude got snottier and snottier
as the threads developed - and things got heated.  Why?  Because our
opinions didn't tally with hers about "twitching".  Because we said
Clerics' weren't essential in a group (note: that doesn't translate
into 'clerics are useless') and because of her attitude when she
positively *insisted* - despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary
- that interrupting a spell wasted her mana. She poured scorn on those
of us who had the temerity to point out she was wrong about that - and
*still* hasn't admitted she was wrong or apologised for that,
preferring to hedge around the issue with smoke and mirrors in the
hopes it won't be noticed.

If this particular thread had been started by someone who DIDN'T have
an axe to grind, I'd have congratulated them - but that wasn't the
intent of her post.  She's grandstanding in the worst possible style
and taste.
