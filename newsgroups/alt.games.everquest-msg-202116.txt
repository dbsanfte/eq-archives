Solstice Earring is the cheapest way of an FT1 item. about 7-8kpp on AB
server.
If you get to 40+ you might try the Hollowshade Moore event and get lucky
with a FT1 range item. Another good one around that level is Shawl 7 (maybe
8 even if you can find some friends to help you with protecting the dorf).
For the rest are FT items damn expensive, 40k for FT1 range (coggboggle),
60k for FT2 belt (from bot), 70k for FT3 boots (from CT), 100k for FT4
gloves (CT) and 100k+ for Ornate Silk Bracelet Pattern (FT2, PoP Tier3+
planes).

What you really want is a mana preservation item. It makes all your spells
cheaper so saves you a load of mana. Mana pres 2 items can be found for up
to 6k I believe, mana pres 3 items range from 10k to 30k. Only dropable mana
pres 4 item is pottery made AFAIK and goes for over 100k if any are sold at
all.
I don't know what class you are but you might also want to look for specific
mana pres items like Affliction Efficiency for dots or the summoned earring
from mages for nukes.

btw, one very good buy if you do a lot of groups is to get a horse or
drogmar (9k one will do fine). They allow you to med while casting and thus
give you full effect of your meditate bonus all the time. Only downside is
that you can't duck to interrupt spells so you need to know what you're
doing or be really fast with typing /dism, <hotkey for duck>. I can do it
under 1 sec these days :).

At your level there aren't a lot of mana reg buffs you can get.in groups of
your level. Brilliance is about it.
Later on many classes will get self-manareg buffs (TPP & XPG for mages for
instance) and some classes get manareg built in their upgraded bufflines
(Spiritual line for beasties and potg/pot9 for druids). This won't do you
much good for now so stick with the brilliance and get a bard with manareg
song (lvl 20 I think).

As for the rest, learn to control your mana. Get a KEI if you want to (while
you still can) but learn to do without and have a limited manapool /
regeneration. It will be a useful skill later on when all the FT, medskill,
horses and mana reg buffs still make you go oom in less then a minute when
the need arises.
