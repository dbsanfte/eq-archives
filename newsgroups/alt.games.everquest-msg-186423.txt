Someone at work was describing life for him as a level 65 Necro.  He goes to
CoD, charms something, and sends it off to fight, and watches the XP roll
in...10-15% of an AA point per kill.  When charm breaks, mez and recharm.
Occasionally he dies...and doesn't bother looking for a res, because he
makes back the XP in 5 kills.  He also mentioned something about FDing and
pets healing back to full health in 30 seconds and that clearing aggro...but
by then my eyes were glazed over.

Anyone know why Sony made it so easy to get XP in PoP?  This seems
completely insane!
