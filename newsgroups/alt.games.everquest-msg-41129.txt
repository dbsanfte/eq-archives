That is a great idea, but you see, I was a member of the Armed Forces in
Desert Storm, and have been flagged as never being able to give blood again.
I was injected with viruses by the United States Government and came into
contact with chemical agents that have deemed my blood unusable to anyone
else except myself.

This is not meant to be funny or a flame. It's the fact.
