From what I have seen thern will be Legends specific items,  ie Helmet of
Legends..  Which you will probably not be able to take back, Yet if you earn
1000pp by killing mobs for 3 days,  of if you loot an item that is common to
both old servers and Legends servers you will be able to bring those items back.

Just a thought...
