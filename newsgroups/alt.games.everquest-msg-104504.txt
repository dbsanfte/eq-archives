ok, in all honesty....upgrade your computer.  actually, get a new computer.
I didn't see what OS you are running, but at the very least, you should
upgrade RAM to 256, MINIMUM, replace the video card and the sound card.

Memory and video are the 2 things I would take care of first, probably the
video before even the RAM.

Make sure you have DX 8.1 installed (won't work with Windows 95, so if you
are running that OS, you are SoL. you need to upgrade the OS to 98 at the
very least. 95 will not run EQ anymore. Luclin or not.)
