I don't see any bigotry in his post... What he says, in a nutshell, is 
that faith is a comfortable position because it does not need to be 
backed up by fact, logic or self-consistency. That *is* true, no matter 
how you look at it.

What you seem to be arguing is that some religious people do not 
necessarly always defend their opinions from the "faith" argument, and 
can in fact resort to logic instead, which is fair enough, and I don't 
think 42 would have a problem with that statement. Hell, Thomas Aquinas 
was both religious and logic.
