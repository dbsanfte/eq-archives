Thanks.. I'm gonna shoot for the tink bag. My monk is my main, so she can 
definitely make good use of the bag. As for twinking my alts - I'm talking 
50pp for spells, banded armor or a FS weapon. Nothing that will hurt my 
monk's 
bank account too bad.:-)

As for the tink bag itself - how hard is it gonna be for me to get? I know I 
need the help of an enchanter to get my charisma up. How's actually getting 
the vendor in Sol A?

Thanks.
Anita
