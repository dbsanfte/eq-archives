Several people have said this.  Am I the only one who doesn't charge people
to bind them? (also am I the only one who thinks you can't make too much
money from binding people?)

I think an NPC in every bindable zone that would bind for a fee would be
great, he could be called the Priest of Bindage and people could dress him
up PoD-style :-)
