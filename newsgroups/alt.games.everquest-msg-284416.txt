If your exp per hour was slower here than it is soloing, and you intend 
to do some soloing, it seems silly to double the slow exp.  On the other 
hand, if you know you're not going to be seeing better exp before the 
next time Lessons pops, I guess you might as well use it.

Veksar, and all hot spots, are hot spots for everyone, not for a 
specific level range.  This is a common misconception, that the level 
ranges SOE gives have anything to do with the exp to be gotten there.

Here's how exp works (more or less); you kill a mob, you get exp based 
on its level, modified by your level relative to its level, by the 
number of people in your group, by racial bonus or penalty, by class 
bonus (class penalties have been removed), and by the "ZEM" (Zone 
Experience Modifier).

If you are level 50, and kill a level 50 mob, solo, you would get the 
same experience, call it X, in any spot in the same zone.  Won't matter 
if one level 50 mob is a goblin and another a sarnak, nor even if its a 
raid difficulty dragon.  Level 50 is level 50 and thats all the exp 
you're going to get for it.

But go from one zone to another, and you'll get a different amount of 
exp for killing a level 50 mob, difference being the ZEM.  Many zones 
have a 100% ZEM, which would be the baseline: your exp isn't modified by 
the ZEM at all.  But some outdoor zones have a lower ZEM, say 75%; you 
get only 3/4ths the exp you might expect.  Other zones have higher than 
100% ZEM; Crushbone, Paladul Caverns being among the most famous with 
their 150%+ ZEMs, you get half again as much exp per kill as you would 
in a 100% ZEM zone.

So what does this have to do with Hot Zones?  Well, a Hot Zone is one 
who's ZEM has been temporarily increased.  I've yet to see a figure for 
how much, some have suggested its doubled but I doubt that.  I don't 
even know if all ZEM's are modified by the same factor.  Perhaps they're 
all increased by 50% points, say, so that a 75% ZEM becomes a 125% ZEM, 
but a 150% ZEM becomes a 200% ZEM, less of an increase.

But my point is, however the Hot Zone thing is applied, it's applied 
universally.  If you're 59 and killing level 59 mobs in Veksar, when you 
ding 60 (and thus hit the official level range for the Hot Zone) you 
aren't going to start getting more exp per kill.  In fact, you're going 
to get less, because your level relative to the mob's level just went 
up.  And level 20's killing mobs in Overthere (which has a cluster of 
mobs good for the low 20s, and then another cluster good for the low 
30s, but a space in the mid 20s where everything is either green or red) 
benefit just as much from the ZEM as level 35's do.
