As always, the best site for tradeskill questions is eqtraders.com.

The boat in Abysmal Sea has two merchants near each other who offer a
great mix of ingredients.  They include all the parts of the Faydwer
Shaker.  Once you triv on that, it looks like a long haul to the next
vendor-ingredients triv; my plan is to use Minotaur Hero's Brew, triv
248.  (I'm planning to go all the way, not stop at 200.)

By the way, if anyone on EMarr wants a sweet deal on Shar Vahl Essence,
in bulk, contact me! :-)
