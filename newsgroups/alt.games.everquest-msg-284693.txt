When I created a new shammy for the sole purpose of making an alchemy
mule, I had a hard time finding a group outside PC so when I got to
20+ I had to solo the remaining few levels before I could get alchemy
skill.  (Skinspikes potion really helped me level up solo)

On Maelin server, depending on the time of the day you play you may
have a hard time getting a decent group between level 20 and 60.  If
you don't plan on grinding to 60+ fast, Maelin should be OK.  But if
you do want to try and hit high level fast or prefer to play only in
groups you may be a bit dissapointed.

Once you get to 70 (and eventually 75) getting grouped can be easy.
