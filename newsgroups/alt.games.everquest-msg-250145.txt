I think we (the collective "we") have identified two reasons:

1. New content offers better xp/loot.
2. Norrath has grown large enough that you just naturally see less people.

Without knowing server populations, it's hard to decide the impact of #2
without anecdotal evidence, which as we all know can be misleading.

Now that I read again what I posted, I realize I'm wrong about the reason
I quit playing MTG.  What's closer to reality is that I quit because at
one point I realized I was trying to be more competitive by spending too
much money on rare cards.
