Sounds like a strange info request, but the prices for Emissary of
Thule (the lvl 59 necro pet) have gotten to the ridiculous range on
Brell. Anyone have any suggestions for how to make at least 20k in
game as an Iks Necro?

The way prices shoot up as soon as ANYONE posts that they have a copy
for sale lead me to believe I need at least that much to have even a
chance of getting the spell...)
