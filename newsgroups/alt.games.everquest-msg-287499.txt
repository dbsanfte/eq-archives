Basically EQ can't play nice with video driver and blows up when you
switch resolution and color depth setting between EQ and Window
desktop.  It usually helps to have the resolution and depth setting
matching both Windows and EQ.

I only get this error in EQ, never with any other game that uses full
screen (same or different rresolution) so basically it's more of EQ
problem not playing nice with video drivers.
