Hail!,

This was a fun survey to read.  Be sure not to take everything it says as
truth, however, as there are some methodological (design) errors which make
generalization to the entire EQ population impossible.

Most of the concerns are related to the survey being based on a convenience
sample of players willing to participate via web/newsgroup advertising.  The
author suggests reasons for why the convenience sample might be acceptable,
however, it is very difficult to perform more than descriptive statistics on
the sample population given such a design.

Nevertheless, it is interesting to see such a study.  Might be really cool
if Verant would ever allow one to do a random sample design.....one could
put light on some interesting sociological/economic issues with such a
design and the ease of collecting "in-game" data.  Where else can you get 30
different planes of existence which, by most measures, were identical to
begin with yet, amazingly, have diverged economically.
