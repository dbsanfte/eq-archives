Of course it does no harm. But the word that has been beaten to death
in the beta was immersion. ;)

And I can't argue against the point that it will hamper said immersion.
After all when I run in EQ1 using the map I don't even pay attention to
my surroundings. I just open the map and steer after the nice arrow
there.

It's nice to have a map - won't argue here. But it would be even
better to use them like a real map. Just find your spot on it
and take the compass to navigate and occasionally check back with your
map.
