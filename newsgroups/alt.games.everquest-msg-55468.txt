It might be nice if it concentrated player run mobs in particular
zones, cycling the zone chosen every, say, 45 minutes, so you could
go on with a friend and organise the orc resistance... It'd be a hell
of a lot more fun fighting 15 dancing, pseudo-intelligent orcs than
spotting that single one behaving slightly smart, smacking it, and
having everything back to normal as it respawned as a fire beetle in
unpopulated_newbie_zone_001
