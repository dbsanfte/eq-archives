On the other hand, I used to be heavily into table-top RPGs, and was a
not-too-shabby campaign designer (although I did prefer the campaign
design phase to the actual GMing... some of my friends were better than
me at it). Then I got my first computer (around 1983, IIRC), and never
looked back.

But yeah, just for the sake of completeness, and to give your skin a
chance to recover from the raster burns, I'd agree with you and
recommend people to try it.
