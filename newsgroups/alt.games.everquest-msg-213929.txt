My first character was a druid which I played until level 60. I got a bit
bored and started a beastlord which is now 59.  My druid had a few more
options on places to solo with harmony, snare, and root.  My beastlord takes
mobs down faster than the druid ever did but I have no add control and can
get owned pretty quickly.  From my experience, my druid was easier in some
ways, but the beastlord has been pure fun to play .
