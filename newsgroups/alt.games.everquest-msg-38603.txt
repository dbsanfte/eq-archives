> Police say racial fight led to Indiana fire

You Americans haven't learned ANYTHING from your past, have you? Your
great-great-grandparents all fled from Europe because of racial and
beliefs-conflicts. Now you are in control of a country of your own and think
you have the right to act the same as the people your forefathers fled from.

You should be ashamed.

If you are not ashamed, you should seek counselling.

If counselling doesn't help, I thank your forefathers to have had the
foresight to flee from Europe.
