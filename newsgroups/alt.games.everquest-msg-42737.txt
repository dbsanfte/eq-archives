Although the map does list him at area one, I've seen him more often between
two and three.  As a druid, though, you have track, and any little quibbling
help like this
shouldn't be useful to you at all.

He does look like a beggar, as I recall, and is very likely on their spawn
cycle.  I
suggest hiring a young SK or Necro, buffing them up, and having them kill all
the beggars they can find down there, see if that helps.

Is this good roleplaying?  No, its no better than hiring a killer to take out
your
wife rather than doing it yourself.

But from a practical standpoint,  the game is designed around this sort of
thing.
By making Vin part of a spawn cycle, they pretty much require that someone
be there killing the rest of the spawn, even though in this case you are (and
have to be)
friendly to him and the rest of the spawn.  Screwed up, eh?
