I noticed this at the Giant camp in EW as well, as I used to always
target Fjloarin Icebane then run around the outside of the fort and
snare him, and have him jump over the wall and attack. Now he does
exactly what you described, runs into the wall and tries to go through
without success. This of course would be a casters dream actually, but
I am doing this with my SK. The aggro range in that fort has been
drastically dropped, as they can each be single pulled, and don't have
any of the ELITE guards that used to summon.
