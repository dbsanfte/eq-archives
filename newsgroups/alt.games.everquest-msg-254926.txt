It can also have a lot to do with the timing on the weapon. A
weapon with a high delay will not hit as often, and hence you
have less chances to gain skill. Usually the cool looking Blunt
weapons have a high delay, so you may want to buy a cheap 1hb
with a low delay time just to get the skill ups.

I have also noticed if your skill is less than 1x your level it
is really hard to gain because you cant hit the mobs. Skillgains
only happen on hits (or near misses aparently.) The best
skillgains seem to come between 2.5x and 3.5x your level. (It
gets hard again over 4x your level in skillpoints)
