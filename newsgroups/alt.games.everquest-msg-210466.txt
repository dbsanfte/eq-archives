"The Lost Dungeons of Norrath introduces an exciting new type of treasure 
to EverQuest. Using new modular items gained from dungeon adventures, 
characters are able to modify the powers and effects of their equipment, 
allowing for a tremendous amount of customization.

Using these new items, characters can augment an existing breastplate, for 
example. Bonding the proper augmentation item to the breastplate might give 
it +5 strength. Bonding a different augmentation item could give it +6 
wisdom. These are just a few simple examples; the new items have a wide 
variety of possible effects and benefits.

Have a helmet that you like, but think needs a little boost? This new item 
system allows you to customize that helmet and make it fit your character's 
needs better. Most characters have a favorite item that they've had in 
their bank for a while. They don't want to destroy it because it holds some 
memories, a link to the adventures they had gaining it. With this new item 
augmentation system, those items gain new life and endless potential!"
