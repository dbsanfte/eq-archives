Hmm I spent so many levels in DL and never seen any of these pathing issues.
Where abouts do they occur so I can avoid them? :)

PoJ, on the other hand. WOW, what a doozie when it comes to pathing issues,
also combined with the wonderful caster LoS problems, namely NPC casters
completely ignoring any LoS whatsoever.
And proceeds nuking their entire mana pool on you from halfway across the
zone through 8 walls and doors before they decide to run towards you
bringing their ALLIES *boggle* the guards..
They are prisoners for peetes sake, guards are supposed to be their enemies,
but then agin they keep their celldoors unlocked so maybe they are nice to
the prisoners..
