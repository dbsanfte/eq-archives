From differing posts on The Druids Grove Message board:

Abren:

Was killing in CoM on E Marr with some guildies and we pulled a named
phantom called Tzirathk to the corner room right after the door you need a
rogue to open. I forget where exactly he spawns, but when killed he dropped
a Jade Reaver and a nodrop essence of Tzirathk. No idea on spawn or repop
time, after the servers came up and our guild whacked Severilious, we went
to grab some reavers.


***************************
And then later Kobara writes

He pops in reaver room upstairs in the temple... get past the first locked
door, into the hallway along the back wall and go up the elevator lift to
the reaver ante room... he spawns up there in the first room with one goo,
one reaver and maybe a wraith. He is not as tough as a reaver, but normal
rules for pulling that room apply... tough to get singles. Harmony can help
here sometimes. Once they are all dead, can begin the pulls of the back room
where the other 4 reavers are found.
