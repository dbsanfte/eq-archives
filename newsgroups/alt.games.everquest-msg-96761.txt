Sadly, I can't say. (No, I'm not trying to be "mysterious" or act "kewl"
or something. Hope you'd know me better than that.) Just don't want to
risk getting a friend into an uncomfortable position. But it will all
become obvious with the next patch message, or possibly even before that
on the dev boards. Keep your eyes open. This is real. :-(

You always came back from death (not a rez... just dying) with full HP
and Mana. Or did that change recently? Pre-ten was never hard "for an
experienced player". But it's a hell of a good learning experience for
the *non* experienced (i.e. new) player. You learn things like getting a
loc if you are going to die. You get used to having to be responsible
for your corpse and know what's up, when, and where. These things become
far more important later on when you have to run much further for your
corpse (or did, anyway, until now when you can apparently get a rez at
level five or so.) and have more expensive gear on it that you dont'
want to lose. (Also apparently not an issue since all corpses will last
a week now. At least the guides' jobs just got easier since all whinging
from level 3 twinks with 20K worth of gear on them who die on the boat
will now cease.)

No specifics that I saw, so we'll have to test it post-patch to see.
Just a fairly flat "no more hell levels or penalty levels xp weirdness".
Not sure if the totals are the same, or if the total required is less,
etc. But that's not the issue IMO. Hell levels have always been there
and are one of many "rites of passage" that people go through, get to
bitch about to their friends, be glad when it's over, comfort their
younger friends as they go through it, etc. It's part of the culture. We
all had to do it. Removing them at this late stage in the game is just
dumbing it down, as I see it, and one step closer to "EQ for
Playstation".

Another "rite of passage". (See above). If it was never there, fine. But
it was. I have a necro at 26 who *STILL* has to look at the bloody book
for nine more levels, and I'm *STILL* pissed about this. Make the game
too easy and it loses some of its appeal.

Get to 35 faster. *g*.

I think I've made it abundently clear what I'm talking about, Jim. It's
my opinion. Yours may differ. Hell, I don't care if you want a total
Monty Haul game. (Not saying EQ is there yet, but just for an extreme
example.) If you enjoy it, you pay your ten bucks, so more power to you.
But I think it sucks and takes away from the challenge and reward system
of the game. Losing the book at 35 was a BIG reward.

Levels 46 to 60 might remain exactly the same, but if you drastically
reduce the time and effort required to get to 46, then you've reduced
the total time and effort, yes? Fairly simple math. But you are focusing
on "easier to get to 60" which was not my point. My point is that "The
Vision" is obviously being flushed. Like it or not, at least EQ was
always a tough, challenging game that would keep people's inerest for
*years* because it was such a hard achievement curve to make it to the
top. The more VI gives in to the whiners and dumbs it down, the less of
that challenge and reward system will be present.

See above. Stop looking at it like a math problem (i.e. how many hours
or xp points to get to 60) and look at it more like the challenge and
reward system that made it a tough, and thus continually challenging and
engaging, game, and you'll see where I'm coming from, even if you don't
agree.
