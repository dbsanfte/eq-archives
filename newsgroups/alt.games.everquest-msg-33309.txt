Need any fishing grubs, that's all i seem to get.  It got so
bad I couldn't loot (I don't like to litter so just hold
everything.  I looked to see why not and i had a back pack
worth of fishing grubs.  I gave some away, I sold some, I
kept a stack.  I really need to start fighting near water so
I can use the things i guess heheh.
