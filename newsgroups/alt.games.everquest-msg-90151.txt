You should be fine, as a troll you will be KoS to live side, not sure if
Tiru will though.

Fight from dead side zone in over to the pit to live side (past the
gargoyles; ivu past ghouls, invis on gargs and all of live side)  once on
live side you'll be near Rasters camp, invis up and proceed past there to
the EE room(use EQatlas, too lazy to describe the path, but don't worry
about the invis pit, just ladder out and take the soft left exit)  At EE, go
left, use the map to get to the "huge water elemental" room, I've had mixed
luck with invis on him, he's agro to everybody, sometimes sees invis, and
frogs are social with him, so you might have to fight there, then invis back
up and proceed to King.
