You think a rogue backstabs for max damage every shot? Just like casters
have resists, melee don't hit for max every time. Plus, you're talking
like someone with pre elemental gear yet a 16 dmg piercer has a max
non-crit backstab of 580 or so and that's with a +12% backstab modifier.
1100 is a crit, and no way in hell do rogues double crit backstabs more
than once every blue moon. There are limited piercers over 16 dmg
outside the elemental planes and none that are dropable so where you get
this generalization I have no clue but it has no relation to reality in
the slightest. I have a 65 rogue with every possible offensive aa maxed
(and there aren't very many) and that adds about 5-6% increase in dps.
