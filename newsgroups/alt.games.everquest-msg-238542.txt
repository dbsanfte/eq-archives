Of course. You didn't think it was something for nothing did you?
You only gain leadership while you are leader.

Melee attack enhancement.
Hit point boost.

Then maybe health regen.

The rest are pretty lame and not worth it IMO.

You can store max 8 at a time.

There are many levels of several abilities.
For instance I bought the first level of melee attack enhancement
and it cost 4 points, now I see to buy the next level costs 5 points.
