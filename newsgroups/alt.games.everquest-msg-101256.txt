You presented a situation where speed was of the essence in getting to Gfay.
That means that you take the first port that comes up to the closest place,
and run the rest of the way, because otherwise you will be likely waiting
even longer than the run time for a port to Gfay.  I do agree with the OP
that the druid in question should have asked first as to whether or not BBM
was acceptable.
