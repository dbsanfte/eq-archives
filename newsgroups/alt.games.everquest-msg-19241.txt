In addition to the protal keys the others talked about, you need
a key to get from Skyshrine to Cobalt Scar; this key works
for anyone in your group in close proximity when the key is touched to the
statue.

There are similar keys for each level of the Tower of Frozen Shadow;
one person in your group needs to have it to take you up to the next
level.  This tower is in Iceclad, I'm guessing that this is where you
got that "key in Iceclad you speak of.
