I have the ATI 8500, and I love it!

You cannot go wrong with either card. If you can wait, both ATI and
NVidia are supposed to be announcing new cards next month. If nothing
else these cards will force the prices down on the GF3Ti500 and
ATI8500 :-).

Right now the absolute best bang for the buck is a GeForce 3 Ti200
card (you can get them online for @$170.00 www.pricewatch.com). Most
of them overclock to standard GF3 specs, and the overall difference
between the GF3Ti200/GF3 and the Ti500 is not worth the $100+ more you
pay for a Ti500.

If DVD playback is important to you, you can also pickup an OEM ATI
Radeon 8500 (clocked lower at 250mhz as opposed to the retail 8500
clocked at 275mhz) for less than $200.00 online.

Cheers
