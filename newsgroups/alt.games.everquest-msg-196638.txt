Stamina isn't exactly a big deal at that lvl, at 30th lvl you'll get
another 1.5 hp for each point of stamina. I'm pretty sure both monks
and rangers get a better return than that.

Any monk should put your ac to shame, given the same money to twink
with. Ranger would be a lot closer but you're still missing parry,
block, riposte, dodge (capped at half of what a 30th ranger would
have).

That regen would be an extra 10 hitpoints per minute standing. 

At no level will you be tanking as well as Ranger or monk, you
could've come close to a monk at the height of their nerfage and it
might even be worthwhile to tank at some point instead of them but
maninly because you don't catch many ripostes and you can keep
torpor/stoicism on yourself w/o reducing DPS much, if any. 

You do argueably make the best offtank in most groups, you're pretty
self-sufficient as far as healing goes, can root park with the best of
them and easily grab agro. Plus, the group doesn't loose DPS when
you're off-tanking.
