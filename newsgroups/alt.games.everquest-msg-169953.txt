Hope you don't mind if I go back and respond to a few of your points
I ignored earlier.  :)


> Oh, and I'd like to know how I "viciously disparage" liberals.


That was poorly written by me, and I apologize.  You certainly do
disparage liberals, and seem to have no qualms at all about attempting
to use the word "liberal" as some sort of an insult.  But I can't
recall you being viscious about it.

I have not ever said that you have no mind of your own, because I
don't believe it to be true.  I wouldn't bother arguing with you
if I did so believe.

Are you certain that it doesn't go more like this:  You start with a
conclusion, go looking for supporting evidence, stop as soon as you
find it and pronounce yourself justified and unbiased?  I can't claim
honestly to have never done that myself.

I think my point there was that those folks <don't> speak for me.

> Would I be wrong to associate them with liberals?


Jackson is definitely a left-winger, I'm not at all certain that he
is liberal.  Farrakhan is a radical, he wants to break things and
doesn't give a damn who or what is lost in the process.  I don't find
it often useful to think of radicals on the right or left as actually
being part of the right or left, and I am certain that for them it is
simply a matter of convenience, not conviction, which side they try
to be asociated with.

Why do I have to have a speaker?  Am I not permitted to have a mind
of my own?  Are you demanding that everybody, left, right, center,
radical, lost-in-space, or whatever, be a bunch of squabbling little
fascists bound inextricably to one faction or another and unable to
act independently?

Here're a few of my beliefs, take issue with them as you please:

Government regulated capitalism is historicly unmatched as a large
scale economic system in terms of allowing a comfortable existence
to the largest fraction of the population.  Other approaches have,
so far, proven themselves to be much inferior.

Unregulated capitalism, as with any sort of unrestrained competition,
rewards evil (or if you prefer anti-social) behavior and thereby
promotes it.  In other words, when there are no rules the griefers
"win" and the rest of us lose.  But then, that's why we make goverments
in the first place.

Representative democracy enjoys a similar empirical validation at
large scale to that of regulated capitalism.  It's the most successful
approach we've come up with yet.  And while I'll admit to being biased,
I much prefer our peculiar American flavor, complete with independent
judiciary and the enshrinement of personal liberty in the core document
of our legal system (the US Constitution, as amended).

Placing any great importance on personal wealth, beyond that necessary
for the good health and reasonable domestic comfort, is an impediment
to happiness in this life as well as whatever may come next.

Demonizing your opponents in political debate is reprehensible.

Attempting to win a political debate by falsely representing your
opponents' views in any way, shape, or form, is just as "evil" as
any other way in which you might "bear false witness against your
neighbor".

Xenophobic behavior is morally wrong.

Allowing any religious organization to directly affect the government
leads inevitably to government influence over that organization as
well as others.  This decreases the variety of opinions having
influence in a society, weakening it and making it less able to
resist various evils.

"Thought police", be they liberal college professors, crackpot cult
leaders, conservative radio talk-show personalities, or whatever,
are morally wrong as individuals and/or institutions.

You replied to something here, but I'm not certain just what it

You're putting words in my mouth (again).  If it appears to you that
I'm just parrotting somebody else, or surrendering my identity for
membership in some particular group, then please ask the question.
(For the record, it appears to me that while you rarely do the former,
you are somewhat prone to the latter)

Um, I do not extend that argument to capitalism in general.  That
would be rather hypocritical of me, given that I am a practicing
capitalist myself, no?

In general, new companies spring up only where the government supports
them.  Either in the old-fashioned way, via enforced monopolies and/or
military support, or in the "new-fashioned" regulated markets where
existing players are made to play nice with the newbies.  Lacking
goverment intervention you have unrestrained competition, or if you
prefer the "law of the jungle", where the "haves" feed upon the fresh
killed carcasses of the "have-nots" and the "wannabes".

It is the life blood of the form of capitalism we practice, in which
the free-ness of the markets is sharply limited by the government(s).
That same competition is the root of the corrupt and monopolistic
practices by which a truly free market is inevitably made into a
mockery of itself.  As with most things human, the best results come
from a successful balancing of conflicting ideals.  When you paint the
world in monochrome absolutes (can't say black and white, somebody
might call me a racist :-p) you are denying reality and headed for
disaster.
