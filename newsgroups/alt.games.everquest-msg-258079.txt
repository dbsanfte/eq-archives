The way I see it, an empty lane is made to be driven in and if all these
dumb Seattle drivers insist on filling up the left lane and letting me drive
to the front of the right, that's fine, but it doesn't mean that I forfeit
my right to merge at the front like any other driver up there would do, and
any resentment based on my taking that action is just silly.

The secret to merging in that situation is to make eye contact. There are
*very* few people who will knowingly block an attempted merge when you're
looking right into their eyes with your unspoken and polite request. A few
will adamantly oppose and drive tighter (these guys are the road rage
candidates) but the vast majority will let you in. The smart ones preserve
their deniability by not looking at you at all (cell phones are great for
this).
