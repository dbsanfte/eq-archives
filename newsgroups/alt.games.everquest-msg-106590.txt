My chanter just hit level 29, it is not a twink character.  Hard earned all
the way, therefore not terribly buffed out.

I want to find a good zone to get xp. Heard Rathe Mtns. might be the place.
I read up on it. Seems like it could be overly dangerous.

What will be the best strategy - secrets to success for me, to make Rathe
Mtns my place for the next few levels?  What should I avoid?

I appreciate your sage advice....
