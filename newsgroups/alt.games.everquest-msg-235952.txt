The reason that it doesn't make a noticable difference is that experience
requirements for the next level raises exponentially, not linearly. The
halfling will reach each new level a bit faster than someone without the
experience bonus, but since the amount of experience needed and the amount
gained rises so fast, the bonus the halfling received on lower levels make
a tiny difference. Once both are working on AA, for which the experience 
needed doesn't raise every AA you get, the halfling will receive one extra
AA level for every 20, which isn't bad but certainly not a big deal.
