The old EQParse program would do something like that, I think.

I tried to get an NPC conversation report into the last version, but there
are so many quirks in the way NPCs interact with you and each other that I
couldn't get the thing to work reliably.

The problem with listing stuff like that is that over time, the conversation
reports themselves would become quite large and spam-laden.
