You're an amazing man, Mr. Jekke.  That you can determine someone's
professional skills based on a few usenet posts is quite amazing.
Perhaps you should consider the daytime talk show circuit.  I bet
they'd be interested in interviewing someone with your magical skills.

Let me assure you that people probably think you're a dick in real
life, too.  And, very likely, a lousy manager.  If you actually are
one.

I can handle rude and obnoxious people like you just fine.  I'm just
dissapointed in people who think it's okay to act the way you do.
And you even claim to act this way in real life!  How sad for you.
