Friends,

I don't have the guide, so I don't know what method these people are
endorsing, but I can tell you a method to make infinite platinum.

I used this method with my human Warrior at about 6th level in
Freeport, but there's no reason you can't start earlier. You will need
some starting capital, but not much. Though I did it in Freeport, you
can also do it in Qeynos (and probably other places as well).

The method is simple: make fish fillets.

Here's the long description:

Get yourself some backpacks or (preferably) tool boxes (Note: the 10
slot box for the muffin quest is also really handy for this - I love
that box. The tax collector box, too.) You can find backpacks at most
of the class guilds, toolboxes at many shops that have a forge
outside. And get yourself a spit at Traders Holiday in East Freeport
(you don't need a spit - you can use one of the city ovens and
actually make more money, but it's a lot more convinient having a
spit).

Next, go to the Port Authority in East Freeport and buy almost as much
fish as you can carry or can afford. Leave two slots open. Then, go to
East Commonlands to the house next to Inn 1. Buy a stack of Jug of
Sauces. Combine the sauces and the fish in your spit into fish
fillets. Sell the fish fillets and buy more sauces. When all of your
fish are gone, load up on Jug of Sauces (leave two slots empty) and
head back to the Port Authority in East Freeport. Buy fish there,
combine and sell. Repeat until you are filthy rich.

When you first start, you will loose money. But as your skill
increases, you will start to make money. Fish fillets trivial at 82.
When trivial, you will have about a 25% failure rate on fillets.
You'll make a profit, but not as much as you could. What I did at this
point was to stop by the Academy of Arcane Sciences in West Freeport
every trip to pick up a few stacks of batwings. I would combine the
batwings with fish first (making fish rolls - a banquet size meal) to
boost my skill, then continue with the fillets (you can sell the fish
rolls too, if you want, but there is no profit in it. I kept mine.)
Once your baking skill is at 102 or so, you will have a 95% success
rate on fillets.

In Qeynos, you can buy fish at the Mermaids something-or-other and
sauces at a house in the north west corner of West Karanas, a spit at
the house in Qeynos Hills. I don't think you can buy batwings
anywhere.

In Halas, you can buy all the stuff in a single zone (except
batwings).

My Warrior, with a 75 charisma, would pay 792cp for a stack of fish
and sauces and sell the resulting 38 fillets (remember, 95% success
rate) for 1330cp.

I used this method to finance my becoming a master blacksmith (about
200pp). It was horrible, tedious work. I'll never do it again. A
positive side effect is that I'm 15th level now, and still eating the
fish rolls I made at 6th level.

I did this about 2 months ago, AFTER eq was patched to reduce the
profit in it. People will tell you it's nerfed so that you can't make
money at it, but, again, this was AFTER the nerfing. Maybe you could
make more money at it before, but you can still make a profit.

PS: You can reduce the initial investment somewhat if you start with
batwing crunchies (batwings + frosting). It's a little cheaper and you
don't loose much money (might even make money, I forget). This is
actually what I did. Batwing crunchies trivial at 46. With 46 in
baking, you will about break even on fish fillets until you skill up a
bit.

Anyways, HTH.
