I've been very grateful to my guild, Hands of Mercy (on Luclin), because
they pulled my delicate Magely butt out of the fire a couple of times.  They
dropped what they were doing to do so and arrived like the calvary.  I
greatly admired that.  I also enjoyed the roleplaying and that members were
expected to live up to the name.  We ran around being good-deed-doers.  I
used to regularly just drop food and water near the gates, etc.  Every
member with whom I had contact was *friendly* and very helpful.

However, it now seems that the Hands are defunct.  (If they are not, please
say so!  But still, no members are ever around it seems, anymore... <sigh>)
Thus I am searching for a new guild.

I value the above mentioned willingness to help out in *dire* need.  Also, I
would like to join a guild that is larger than was the Hands.  However, I'd
rather not discover that the guild membership has been padded with idiots
and unfriendly jerks.

I'd rather be a member of a guild that was interested in fun and roleplaying
rather than power-leveling.

It'd be nice if the Guild had permanence but also tolerated members that are
not able to play 24/7.

If anyone has any suggestions as to which guild(s) to consider, I'd love to
hear about it.

Word-of-mouth, private invitations.  Good lord, don't SHOUT!  It hurts my
ears.


> 4.  What type of services should a guild offer you the member?

Camaraderie, a willingness to help out a member who was in *dire* need.  And
I mean if he/she/it has a serious problem with recovering a corpse, for
example.   I do not expect, nor would I want to be a member of a guild where
expectations of 'services' existed, e.g. buffing, porting, etc.
