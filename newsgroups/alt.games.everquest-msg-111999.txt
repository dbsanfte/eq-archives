Interesting, I didn't know there was a rare cycle in SK.  My (now retired)
ranger spent a lot of time there, but killing a rare (like Gnawfang or
Cracktusk) didn't seem to spawn another rare in my experience.  I'd unretire
it to test the theory and help mages out if I knew what the rare cycle is
(it's easy to spot the rare mobs of course if that's all it is).

Spawning rare mobs was always a hobby for my ranger, in fact he was created
to test the theory that bixies are placeholders for griffins in EC.  So, if
you are a high level mage on Drinal looking for help with Quillmane, let me
know and I'll dust off Fleethawk (lvl 44) and help you out for awhile
(free!).
