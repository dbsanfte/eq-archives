I believe there are some people that play EQ as a business. I know there are
people that play UO as a business (and do quite nicely out of it).

Just because you play a game, does not automatically exclude it from being a
business.

I don't think the cause and effect is in the right order here. It is because
Verant object to the sale of characters and items (for whatever reason),
that it is in the EULA. They don't object simply because it is in the
EULA.... that is what the majority of people here do.

I would like to see Sony take this to court, and see once and for all
whether the EULA is valid or not. Whether or not you can get away with the
"I was only selling my time, Your Honour" defence.

 At the moment, every time this subject comes up, we have all the armchair
Clarence Darrows (on both sides) saying  "you would get laughed out of
court"

The truth is, that until it goes to court, the whole subject is an exercise
in frustration.

You have to wonder why Sony has not taken any action yet.  My own,
admittedly cynical, theory is, that it does not make good business sense for
them to take legal action against the people who play their game. Although
they say they don't like it, they seem to have no real interest in pursuing
offenders, after all, what would it gain them to do so.

If he does start a business selling EQ items and accounts, he won't need to
be worried about any legal action from Sony.
