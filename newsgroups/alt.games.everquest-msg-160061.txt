I'm pretty sure you are incorrect.

Look at yourself next time you cast a druid skin when unbuffed.  I believe you
will see your max HP jump up but not your current HP.  Cleric/paladin HP buffs
raise your current and total HP, as does the shaman/beastlord spell Inner Fire
(and probably others) but I'm pretty sure no such thing happens with druid
buffs, so when you get one you instantly look injured.

I could be wrong, mind you, its been ages since I played my 34 druid as anything
but a taxi/bazaar mule (he was born for this purpose, not abandoned), and its
vaguely  possible that I figured out it was inefficient and never bothered with
it as a heal... but I really don't think so.
