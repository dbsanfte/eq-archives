I had more than just bad streaks.  I  could barely cast anything.  As
several other people have had the problem but you didn't, perhaps you are
the lucky one?  And I've only worked my Beastlord up to 38 so far, so I
wouldn't know about the post 51 levels unfortunately.  Anyway, whether you
had good streaks or I had bad streaks, I think it just makes sense for them
to have Hybrid fizzle rates as that's what Beastlords are.
