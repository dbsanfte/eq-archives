  The principle here is different, though.

  Verant states that the reason their naming policy is in place the
way it is, is to make sure the names are non-offensive and
non-suggestive of vulgarity, and to prevent names inappropriate for
the fantasy genre from disrupting the atmosphere (and to prevent
copyright infringement lawsuits against them).

  There is no reason that makes any sort of sense that these rules
should not also be applied to NPCs.  A person who finds a name vulgar,
offending or out-of-genre is not going to feel it is any less so
because the name belongs to an NPC and not a PC.

  Now, when it comes to gameplay mechanics, NPCs are not subjected to
the same rules as PCs, but there's actually a solid reason for that.
If PC characters had all of the abilities of NPCs (see through walls,
ignore the z-axis for attacking people, lots of HP for their level,
the ability for even casters to melee for huge amounts of damage,
ect.) the game would be a lot less challenging and probably a lot less
fun.  Same goes for the reverse, if the NPCs were subject to all the
same rules as we are, without a significant improvement in AI, the
game would be unchallenging.

  The name in question, "Bait Masterson", isn't that bad, in my
opinion, but if it were a name chosen by a PC, I have no doubt that
eventually some GM would make them change it.  It IS a lot more
suggestive/offensive than a lot of PC names that I have seen forced
changed.

  But I suppose it's harder to change a quest-oriented NPC's name than
it is to force a PC to change theirs.

  Still, it is a double-standard and Verant is guilty of being a bit
hypocritical on this particular point.

  And, yes, it's their game... they can do whatever they want.  But
that doesn't mean it's "right."  If they say they have created a
policy to keep their game "G" or "PG" rated or whatever, they should
hold themselves to that same standard, or, in my eyes at least, they l
ose credibility.  Verant reserves the right to do a lot of totally
rude and unfair things (like cancel your account at a moment's notice
for absolutely no reason other than a whim)... that doesn't mean they
should.
