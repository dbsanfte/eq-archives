Thank you all for you thoughts  :)  

As I said, when I found out it never ocurred to me to think twice...  LOL  But
since the guild doesn't have a cut and dry policy and since it was brought to
my attention by some other members that perhaps this officer should step down
if she is going to be in more than one guild, I figured I'd better hit you guys
up for advice...  

I'm gonna stick with my original plan and not think thrice about it...  :)
