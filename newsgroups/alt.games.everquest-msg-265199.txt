Hmmmm..... I had not intended to play EQ2 and, from the contents of
that patch message, I still don't. It sounds a lot to me like they
just remade EQ1, with better graphics. And, they included all the SHIT
that they fucked up EQ1 with post Kunark expansion, right from the
start.

Wonderful idea, Sony.

Uber equipment fucked up EQ1.

Designing content for guild raids rather than group play fucked up
EQ1.

RESISTS fucked up EQ1, more than anything else. Resists don't belong
in Everquest, or any other game, as anything more than a random
chance. Players should NEVER be able to make themselves immune to
magic, in a game that has magic. NEVER. NO, NOT EVER. REALLY. It
destroys gameplay, and leads to idiotic encounter designs where
critters do massive amounts of area effect melee damage and shit to
make up for useless magic effects. It leads to magic users being
turned into specialty one trick ponies, because their magic is
generally useless. It leads to an endlesss amount of stupidity. Why in
the WORLD is Sony making this mistake AGAIN? Inexcusable. This alone
takes EQ2 off my shopping list. I've already seen what the long term
effects of this mistake are, I'm not planning on investing a year or
more in a game only to have my characters obsoleted by bad game design
again. No, not again, dammit.

And, they added player housing. Excuse me, but which game, exactly,
was improved by player housing? Crafting doesn't interest me much, but
at loeast I can ignore a craft system if I don't want to use it. I
cannot ignore player housing. It's gonna take an extra 20 minutes to
get from point A to point B now, due to having to having to run
through a maze of empty and abandoned player houses. Just like it has
in every other game that supported player housing. WHy? Because the
truth is, player housing doesn't add anything to the game. People
don't "hang out" in their player houses. No, they don't throw virtual
parties in their virtual houses for their virtual friends. No, they
don't sit on their virtual asses by their virtual fireplaces reading
their virtual books. Really. They don't. They say "Wow, that's my
house! Cool!" and then they go back to loot farming and never come
back.

Anyway, I was never really looking forward to EQ2... it's been clear
for years that Sony didn't have any in-house creative talent anymore.
I'm dismayed that they are making a "sequel" that seems to be no more
than a massive patch and a player wipe of Everquest though. 


What were they thinking?
