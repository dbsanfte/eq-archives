At this point you would have needed to tell him that the NPC is a triggered
spawn, and the trigger item was lost in the rollback.

My advice is sort of close to Faneds... you need to petition again.   I
wouldn't recommend telling them you had the final item and need it
reimbursed though.  They can and do verify that sort of thing.

You need to petition again, and include the information that at X time there
was a rollback due to server crash, which interrupted a triggered script
(key words) and the trigger item you handed in was not returned.  (They
should be able to verify that you had the trigger item at one point.)

If a guide tells you no, ask to speak to a GM.   If a GM tells you no, ask
to speak to the Server head GM.     (Or at least be aware that the first
person to answer you may not be the one who has the final authority to
decide.)

Actually, you should probably cut out the middle men and use the "Contact
your server GM by e-mail" option from Sony's website.   Explain that you
lost a trigger item because the script did not run to completion due to a
server crash.   Most likely they will reimburse the trigger item, which is
the hard to camp part.  (Include the approximate time and date the crash
happened.)

Good luck
