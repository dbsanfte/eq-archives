Greetings

After I got POP, i noticed this new AA skill at lvl 51, "New Tannan Crafting
Mastry" and I'd like to ask anyone who's had it, or gotten it, what exactly
it means.  Does this mean that I'll be able to get more than 1 skill over
200?  So if I have 250 in say, tailoring, i'll be able to get 250 in a
second skill?  or all skills? Or is it a percentage?

Sorry, I couldn't find any info on the net, and thought i'd ask here before
I worked on the 6 pts it's gonna cost me to get it =\.

Dea
