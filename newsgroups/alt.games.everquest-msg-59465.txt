My (very subjective) take on the interfaces is that that it's
a push (before Velious, DA would have been the winner - hands
down).  If VI continue to improve the interface in Luclin,
combined with the small touches that 2 1/2 years of constant
post release development have brought, that EQ will have an
advantage.

I think it's just a matter of flexibility - just about everything
in EQ has a / command now, there a huge options to automate
some of the more tedious clicking around.  (although I still 
want to see /unmem [slotnumber  and /mem [slotnumber] [pagenumber]
[spellnumber])
