I haven't tested it, nor do I particularly plan on doing so, but from what
I've gleaned from other peoples' testing, monks don't follow the same rules
in this regard.  I'll agree with what you state above, but from some monks'
testing, monks have a *class specific* hard cap (not soft cap) where AC
ceases to have any impact on tanking ability.  Like I said, I have no
intention of actually testing to find out whether they are correct, but it's
been claimed and yet to be refuted.

In spite of what I posted in this same thread, I just had to spout off that
I've tanked Jiva.  :)
