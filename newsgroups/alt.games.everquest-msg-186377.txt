No, there has been no contact from SOE before, during or after the
change.  It's not a big issue, but it's at times like these that I
wonder if Asheron's Call 2 might be worth investigating.  At least
then I would regain some level of innocence about the levels of
customer service.  I can count the number of times I've seen a GM on
Antonius Bayle in the past year on one hand.
