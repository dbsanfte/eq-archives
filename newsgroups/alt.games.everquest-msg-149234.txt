Sad thing is, evolution can go both ways it seems.  Or maybe that's just the
method nature uses to naturally de-select a species.

One theory in sociology says:

1) If two smart people breed, they will be more likely to have a smart
child.  If two stupid people breed, they are more likely to have a stupid
child.

2) Stupid people tend to have more children than smart people.

Therefore, we will begin to get stupider as a race.


Isn't that an encouraging thought?
