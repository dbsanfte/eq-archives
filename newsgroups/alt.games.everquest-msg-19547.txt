..yet still not incorrect <G>.  It is stupid, a waste of time from a
gamers viewpoint and for the most part so childish that I would rather
folks were unaware that I find parts of the sight amusing.  JeffK is
their major redeeming quality and that doesn't say much for them, hehe.

btw, thanks for your comments on AO in your other posts.  I know this
isn't an AO board, but I was happy to hear the positives in your
comments.  I expected the negatives I've heard and so planned on waiting
six months before looking into the game depending on what else is going
on in the gaming world at that point.  Hearing your comments on the good
parts reaffirms the interest I have simply because I can't imagine you
saying nice things about the game if it weren't so.
