Yep.  They are.  Because some sissy cried to his mommy that mages got
something useful and their class didn't so we got whacked.

Magicians FINALLY get something useful besides CoH and Rods, and some
fucking ninny (Furor of Firesof Heaven) whines and it gets nerfed.

Modified Effects:

- Jedah's Lesser Conservation - Something was added to this? - Not new, but
this only works on spells less than 12

- Jedah's Conservation - Something was added to this? - Not new, but this
only works on spells less than 44

- Jedah's Greater Conservation- Something was added to this? - Not new, but
this only works on spells less than 60 (which would explain why I saw no
benefit from wearing it and casting KEI)

- Gallenite's Minor Destruction - Something was added to this? - Not new,
but this only works on spells less than 34

- Gallenite's Destruction - Something was added to this? - Not new, but this
only works on spells less than 52

- Gallenite's Major Destruction - Something was added to this? - Not new,
but this only works on spells less than 60

- Naki's Lesser Pernicity - Now only effects spells with cast time greater
than 4 and less than 9.5 - Not new, but this only works on spells less than
29

- Naki's Charm of Pernicity - Now only effects spells with cast time greater
than 4 and less than 9.5 - Not new, but this only works on spells less than
51

- Naki's Greater Pernicity - Now only effects spells with cast time greater
than 4 and less than 9.5 - Not new, but this only works on spells less than
60

Notes: When the cast reduce rings were working on spells greater than 9.5,
it did work on reducing the cast time on KEI, a level 60 spell, so maybe
these mean less than or equal to 60 instead of less than 60?

I've have heard this rumor on the mage boards.  Apparently, the ring
(reduced casting time) unbalanced the Complete Heal spell.  And there is an
exploit with the necklace (reduced spell component usage) enchanters can
use.   Oh well...I knew they wouldn't last long.
