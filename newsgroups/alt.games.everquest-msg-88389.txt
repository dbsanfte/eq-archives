Define "they".

If you mean "vendors", that would only be the case
if some players first sold the spells to vendors there.

...which might be pretty likely, because it drops
from mobs in Fungus Grove pretty regularly, and
players have gotten in the habit of just selling
spell scrolls to vendors there instead of trying to
/auction them.

I personally looted my own KoT scroll while hunting
in Fungus Grove, but it would probably be pretty easy
to just go to Fungus Grove and check the vendors, and
if you strike out there, /auction for it until someone
responds.

Now, if I could only find Breath of Tunare...  I've
been auctioning for it for about a week now.
