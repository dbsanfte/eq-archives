The newest servers are the three European servers run by Ubisoft, of which
Venril Sathis would be of most interest for you unless you speak French or
German.

We have a very low population. So low that Ubisoft in desperation has allowed
1000 free server moves with gear, and will now allow anyone to move here with
gear for the normal transfer price of USD 50.

It's called mudflation, and will always exist in EQ or any game like it.
However it's much less rampant on VS than other servers, and if you want
something specific your better off trying to get it yourself than hoping
to find it for sale in the bazaar.

We have quite a few real newbies, mostly Europeans who have bought the
Ubisoft edition of EQ (not required to make a character on VS).

Overall it's a pretty nice server, there's a different sense of community
compared to other servers, although there is some resentment amongst the VS
natives about the movelog(gers).
