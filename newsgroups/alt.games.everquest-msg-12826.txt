There really aren't any phenomenal weapons that would benefit you,
obtainable at your level, so a basic weapon will have to suffice.
While you are fighting in Black burrow, head up towards the pits
(taking the route that requires you to swim underwater, and climb
ladder).  There are giant snakes there, and occasionally they will
drop fangs, which make decent piercing weapons.
