At level 52, soloing reasonable things as a Wizard, I was getting about 20K
XP/minute average, killing level ~40 mobs every 6 minutes.  I can kill a
deepwater croc in Oasis with one nuke.  They are level 17-21, with up to
about 600 HP.  If greens gave XP at the normal rate, that would be 22-33K XP
per croc, and it takes me under a minute to med back the mana from that one
nuke.

With level 10 mobs, it takes killing 2.7 mobs/minute to earn XP at the same
rate as killing a level 40 mob every 6 minutes.  I could do that easily,
with one AoE nuke.

It gets even more ridiculous for melee characters.  20K XP/minute can be
earned by killing a level 7 mob every 11 seconds.  A level 7 mob will
typically have under 200 hitpoints, so a high level melee can mow them down.
There would be zero down time as long as the mobs held out, because a level
7 mob can't hit a high level melee character.  Hell, a level 7 mob can't hit
my 52 *Wizard* often enough to get ahead of my *standing* regen.  The only
thing that would keep level 50 Warriors from XP'ing in places like Misty
Thicket would be that they would run out of mobs.

This is why they have to cut off XP for greens.  If they just awarded XP
normally, you'd see level 50+ players leveling up in complete safety in
places like Oasis and West Commons.  They could have made greens give a
token amount of XP, but there would not be any real point to it.
