I've discovered now that if I disable sound in the eqclient.ini file then the 
delay is eliminated. I'm using the same hardware and (from what I can tell) 
drivers as before, so I'm not sure why it would now cause a problem. I'll play 
with sound off for now since I don't use it often. Once Creative ships my SB 
Live! back I'll see how it works using that card. Unfortunately I must closely 
watch my health now since I don't hear myself getting hit.
