Gees I never thought California would change the laws like that (liberal #2
after Mass.) I'd reason that would be the case in Texas (our most holiest
of the right wing states where, last I heard, an open container and a

help the deceased) I'd bet the civil suits start flying as soon as the
grand jury closed the case.
