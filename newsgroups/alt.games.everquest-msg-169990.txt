You miss Jazz's point. If everyone could insta-copy thier character
over to... say.. Test2, they'll use it as a "try before you buy" kind
of feature. Better said, if you were wondering if you and your guild
could bring down Mob X - the only way to find out if you really can is
to try, and perhaps die in the process. If you can copy your guild
over to another test server to see if you can, then theres really no
risk involved and nothing is on the line. It would be used as a safety
net so to speak.
