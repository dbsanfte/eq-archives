Ha ha  Nice personal attack...  Nice dodge as well..

You don't recall saying...

"As the child gets older and is able to formulate deeper questions,
such as "but how did Johnny's blood mix with somebody else's" then you
answer those questions."

So, in other words, you are NOW saying that you DO want to wait til
the child is older for the more intricate concepts, you just don't
TELL the child he or she has to wait til they are older...

So much for honesty with your child...
