You're a rogue - faction is very rarely an issue!

It's been a while since I did my 10th war, even longer since I did 1-9...
you need positive faction at the 9th ring stage thats for sure (a turnin to
Dain himself), and even if it were sneakable I wouldn't recommend it.  Dain
has a proc that banishes you down into the well, not only would you be
stuck, you'd be stuck with level high 50's mobs (tentacles etc)

1 thing that does require max ally - once you have the 10th ring, you can
hand it into Dain (its returned) and get a right click DA item.  It's only 1
charge and lore, but its extremely useful, and when its used just go hand
you're ring in again
