Aye but if you are going after reds (and my Beastlord made a point of
doing nothing but... like my druid) then the time it takes to heal yourself
up with slow ranger style self heals is long enough that your pet does
get seriously injured... which is OK because its cheaper to CHeal
him than it was to heal yourself back up to 50%!

Aye its an astonishing class, I just wish more of them would level up
into the high 50s and start looking for groups, because I have no
real idea what good they would do there.  Seems most people shelved
them after a month or two, just like I did.  With this 'sploit fixed, there's
less chance than ever that I'll bother picking mine back up, not that
I feel its not a fair change, but I'll miss the superpower feeling it
gave me.

Now Beastlords are no better than say Batman, mortals who are
merely very powerful, not bulletproof like Clark Kent
