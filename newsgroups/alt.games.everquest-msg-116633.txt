Just curious about how long people have taken to get to non KOS status
with the Dragons if they started young and did it on wolves and giants
in GD and EW, etc.?  My main didn't start working on faction until late
in life, and I just started by doing Kael arena, so it went pretty
darned fast.

My wizard, however, is only 34 but is currently hunting the dire wolves
and frost giant scouts in GD. A couple sessions of that and I noticed
that I'm already up to Amiable with the dorfs. I know that's not NEARLY
enough to fix CoV faction, but it would be nice if I could get to
dubious before I hit 39 and get the "gate into Whoashit's arms" spell. 
Will max ally to dwarves on these little faction hits get me out of the
dragon's cooking pot? Or will I just have to suck it up and try to tag
along as a useless pimple butt on somebody's Kael raid?
