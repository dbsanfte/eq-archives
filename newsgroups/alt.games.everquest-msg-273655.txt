Not much to do???

Let's see, I've got 3 active characters (though I'm mostly running
only two lately), who are working on various long quests, making
progress on some "tasks", farming for tradeskill ingredients, trying
to figure out the new quests that have been showing up ahead of the
coming expansion, chatting with guildies and other friends and just
whoever else happens to be around, asking around to see what focus
items I should be trying to upgrade to, practicing different tactics
(quadding, charming, fear-kiting, etc.), seeing if any lowbies can use
a helping hand (stick that in your EQ2 pipe!), exploring areas I've
never been to, trying to improve my faction in various part of the
Old World, and oh yeah, maybe even getting some solo xp.

Heck, I often feel like I've got so much to work on that I don't put
my LFG flag up because if I get into a group there'll be so many other
things I won't get around to!

	-- Don.

p.s.: As I composed this, I kept having to go back and add more things
to the above list.  It's probably still not complete. :-)
