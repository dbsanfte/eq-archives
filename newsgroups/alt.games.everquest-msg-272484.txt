Ok,
so I finally broke down and bought it...I hope I will still play EQL :) 
Anyways, I really have alot going on at this time of year and I haven't 
the time to search for the answers to a few questions I have, so 
hopefully they can be answered here for what little time I'll get to 
play over the next couple months.

First, I made a barbarian with the intent to make him a Pally or 
Crusader I guess. Well it seems my buddies all have evil guys in 
Freeport and I'm in Qeynos.

My questions are, Will I be able to hunt with them and if so how long 
will it be till I can safely get to them?

Can I ever enter their city ? Do I need to enter a city to ever "train up"?

Can I "betray" Qeynos and become a resident of Freeport and still be a 
crusader/pally ( I want the healing/fighting type )?


If anyone has some decent suggestions/answers please let me know.

Thanks
