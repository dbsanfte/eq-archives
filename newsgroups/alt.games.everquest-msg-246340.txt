> I quit EQ...again....it started to become work.

Thanks for a break from the usual "tHis game is teh suck" type of quitting
message, yours was actually a pleasure to read. Sorry about the personal
situations and I'm sure you don't need any armchair advice but my guess is
that whatever time pressures EQ caused in your life, it was likely only
symptomatic of something else, and not a primary cause. All of us take
something different from EQ. I have a a friend in the guild whose mother IRL
was a Hell's Angel and crack addict, and he never met his father. The way
he's described it in our many talks, his life was one series of hells on
earth, it's really amazing that he's come as far as he has in his
professional life. Through EQ he met his current fiance in real life, an
Amish sweetheart who moved to the city to go to college, one of the
sweetest, most wonderful players I've ever met in any game. For my friend,
EQ was and is his family, and the guild that we share is his extended
family. It's amazing to me that people still accuse video games of being
"anti-social", when in fact the only thing I really enjoy about this one
anymore is the social interaction.

Damnit, I was all set to leave EQ myself and then I read the patch message
regarding GoD changes and I'm curious. I guess it depends on how hooked I
get on City of Heroes, which is taking far more of my time than EQ.

Thanks again for the thought regarding balance. In all things.
