a) fuck VI customer service. those people are worthless

b) new game codec's implamented months ago added your
characters ability to reappear at bind point with the
gear, cash and anything else you were carrying up to level

c) corpses under level 6 have a 30 minute timer on them
before being deleted from the server cache.

d) if the timer on your corpse while in the gaming server
expired there isnt much that can be done about this. character
game save records arent logged untill level 6 through 60 and
will not be reset because they cant. any effort in trying to
aquire lost items will result in a)
