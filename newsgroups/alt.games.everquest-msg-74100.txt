Trust me when I tell you that some day you will look back on lvl 45
fondly, and recall how easy it was to get xp.  51 is the next big
nightmare ahead of you, and 52 isn't turning out to be much better. If
you spent "several hours" and got half a yellow, you should be cheering.
I'm currently doing my xp grinding in the Hole. (Highest xp bonus zone
in the game, 25% bonus). We can set up camp and do a steady grinding
pull for about six hours with no deaths. If I have better than half a
yellow I'm sending up balloons.
