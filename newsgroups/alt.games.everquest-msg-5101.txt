My character in the guild is married to the guild leader (it least in the
game) she is already in the guild quite by accident and un beknownst to me.
Our sister Guild run buy our guild leaders RL wife asked one of our officers
to invite her.  My guild knows of my past with her and they have told me to
boot her.  But I am going to wait till either of the actual guild leaders
are online.

Since this incident, we have stoped recruiting for a while till we can
figure out a way to 'screen' our applicants..  Like :  Having to be refered
by a member,  a quest or task, a 5 person voted(would be surprised how small
norrath is sometimes)  a  minimum lvl (10, 15, 20, ?) except on a players
alt who can join.

I have talked to the officer who invited her.  He knew about what happened
but not the name of the player or he wouldn't have invited her.  She, at
some times seems to have changed....
