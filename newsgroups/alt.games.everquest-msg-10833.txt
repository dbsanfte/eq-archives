Well, an enchanter will never deal much damage, but you should have more than
enough to do with crowd control, the area you excel in.  I don't play a chanter,
but I know they are one of the busiest classes when you have a 4 or 5 mob pull.
Maybe your experience has been mainly with single pulling?  Charm is a lot of
fun too - my bard is still having fun with that trick.
