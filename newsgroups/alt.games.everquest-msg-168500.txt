Hi Shirl,

WinGate 5.0 will share your Internet connection with your client
computer and you should have no problems playing EverQuest at your
second computer or the WinGate server.

In order to address the problem you are currently experiencing I would
like to know what type of internet connection you are currently using
and if you are experiencing this particular problem at the WinGate
server or client computer.

With this information it would be most helpful in resolving this
particular problem.

Also, if you would like, you can contact me at
chadl@support.deerfield.com and I will be more then happy to assist
you one on one.
