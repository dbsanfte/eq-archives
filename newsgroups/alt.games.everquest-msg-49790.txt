150pp should net you a Flowing Black Robe (think Priest of Discord) and 
leave you plenty of change, oooorrr... Perhaps a Robe of Enshroudment 
(pure, solid black) if you find a bargain (200-250 seems to be closer to 
the actual price, but you could easily get lucky).

Don't worry about the money too much. Income goes up exponentially as you 
level, and as a Necro, you'll level fast.
