If you do that everytime you zone, all I can say is you are an idiot, 
regardless of what pet class you are.  The only time you should be 
worrying about getting a pet, fully buffing and equipping it is when you 
are zone into the zone you are going to fight in.  Certainly that is true 
for me.  Of course, my pets don't use a reagent to summon, they just cost 
a boatload of mana compared to all other pet classes.  Even with my 
enchanter, I only summon a pet sometimes, and that's when I am in the 
zone I am fighting in.  I certainly don't summon a pet every time I zone.
