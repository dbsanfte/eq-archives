Wushoi will kill anyone who is KOS to COV.  Killing frost giants is a very slow way
to raise COV faction.  Its Possible you've all done enough of it to squeek by, but
porting in to WL isn't the best way to find out.

I reccomend you get a port to Cobalt Scar (if the wizard doesn't have that in his
book, hire someone who does if you have to).  The Wyverns and Cobalt Drakes here
are also on COV faction, but don't see invis, and frankly arent' going to tear you
apart on sight even if you do aggro one.  They are blue to 43 mobs and quite
soloable at that level.  At any rate, simplicity itself to check faction by coming
here, and very low risk.

Wuoshi is rarely up, pops occaisionally and is usually killed by a third tier guild
in fairly short order, or by a higher tiered guild just to keep the ring clear if
noone has gotten around to it.  Thus, you can always just take your chances and
port in, you'll only end up dead one time in 20.  Invis won't help, though, the
only thing that might would be SOW and a readiness to run immediately on zone in.

I don't know of a guide to hunting in the zone.  Tigerraptors start to go cyan at
44, a druid friend was still  quadding geonids at 60, so you are probably in the
correct level range for -something- but I have no idea what.
