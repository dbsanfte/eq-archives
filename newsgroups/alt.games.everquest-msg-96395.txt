Actually, I'm not all that new to EQ.  I started playing Mid 2000.  For
the first 9 months I probably switched to a new character every few
weeks.  Then I took a few months break.  I came back the middle of last
year and played a cleric on Test (I liked the low/friendly population
and the idea of trying out new stuff) for a couple months, got her up to
25, then life got busy for me, so I stopped playing again.  When I came
back again recently, I decided that, eventually, I want to play the end
game.  I want to have fun working my way up and then one of these days
get into an Uber guild and see the stuff so few people see.  I knew I
couldn't really do that on Test, so I started up again on Anyone a
couple of weeks back.  Took a week messing around with different
characters.  I think I know where I'm going now.  Although, having
played EQ off and on for a year and a half (off and on), my experiences
have been very limited.  Each time, I've tried going about things
different ways and that's also why I've been asking so many questions
lately and reading as many posts as possible.  I'm ready to do well and
work for it.  But I guess you're right, in a sense I'm new.  I'm new to
being an int caster (I don't count the Necro I played as my second
character ever, I thought pets were useless), new to being an evil race
(see above), and new to being a Dark Elf.  I guess my EQ experience is
very unique.  You'd think as much as I played the low level characters,
I would be good at them by now. :)  I'm not sure why I started this
post, but I guess it became my introduction to the group.  Hello all!
