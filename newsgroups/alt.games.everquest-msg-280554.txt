Unless they've changed something, you don't need to install anything first.
Just copy the entire everquest directory from an already fully-patched
machine.

Other than adding the data point that last time I did this, about 6 months
ago, it didn't need to patch, I'm not sure there's any way to help.  Make
sure whatever copy method you're using (I used winzip and then windows file
sharing to transfer the zipfile) isn't corrupting or losing any files, of
course.

Note that it may CHECK a lot of files, but won't actually transfer any.
