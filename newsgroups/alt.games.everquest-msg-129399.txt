I agree with you, terrorism doesn't seem like a legitimate political weapon,
because most of the time, the people that are on the receiving end don't
want to compromise after it, but retaliate. It is prefectly understandable,
they don't have to. However, they also could also take into account the loss
of civilian life and make an effort to hear what the other side has to say.

However, I'm not sure that terrorists are cowards. If you can, put yourself
in their shoes. What would be the consequence of them trying to fight the
Israelian army, in this case? Rocks and pipe bombs against jets and tanks...
They feel oppressed, and they retaliate in the way that they think can bring
about the best results. Of course, we all see what results it brings in
reality, but I'd be hard-pressed to tell if they are maniacs or if the
Israelian government is a bully. Especially after Sharon was elected by
promising a harder line than Netanyahu (dare I say like Milosevic who was
elected for the same reason in Serbia?).

And if you think terrorists or guerilleros or whatever you want to call them
can't be heroes, well what can I do? Especially here in North America
(that's where I am anyway), we almost only hear what interested parties have
to say about foreign fighting. If you've never heard of underarmed,
outnumbered people fighting for a "just cause", I rest my case. Of course,
I'm not saying I think the cause of the Palestinians is just or not in
reality. I don't believe in objective journalism.

ciao

Sebastien
