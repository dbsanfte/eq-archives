With safe fall, you don't have to worry about levitate as often just
to avoid taking damage on a run, though. Save time memming/casting the
spell, a little mana, and a batwing. Small, but it's a little hassle
you don't have to go through. *shrug* Sorry, I consider a racial skill
that can't be matched by every single damn character in the game in
the end to be a LOT bigger than Iksar's higher starting swim,
especially one that saves HP/mana/time (no matter how small)...
