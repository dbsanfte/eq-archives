   Not that I've heard, it hasn't.  But at least they are saying out loud
that it needs improvement, that there is a problem here.  And this is  a
good sign.

  Hmmm... interesting.  I can see this working, bringing new people into
the higher end content that they seem to be focusing on.  I mean, if I read
this right.  LDoNs might = Elemental access?

   I agree.  Anything that alleviates the bitching about asshole guilds
that try to cock block everyone else *is* good.

   So do I.  For dinner.  Well, no.  For Lenny's dinner.

   Shiny toys.  Might distract some into sticking around long enough to see
some of the new improvements they say they are trotting out.

    Good for Shaun.  Dunno how it will affect me, though.  But I am happy
Shaun can go off of unemployment, or whatever.

I hope they make a big banner of this statement and hang it across their
office hallways, where the developers have to duck to miss it every time
they go out for Redbull and Cheesy Poofs refills.

   Good to know.  I suppose.

   Ok, they didn't say these were good things, so I'm not sure...  But I
think that these are very good things indeed.  This right here is one of
the issues that is getting people to quit in frustration.  Maybe there was
something about this in that EQ Manifesto that someone wrote and selfishly
won't share with the rest of us.
