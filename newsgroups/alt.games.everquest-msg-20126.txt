Hehe, i had an experience like that with my first char (wood elf rogue *s*).

Was grouping in a great group in Castle Crushbone, and got a lot of CB
Belts. Had so many so i didnt really felt i needed them (had 40 of them in
bank), so gave all i had to the cleric in the group when we split up.

5 min later she showed up with her alt, and gave me 7 pieces of banded
armor, and tried to give me a Dwarven Ringmail Tunic, but had already given
that one to another player.

And pay attention to whats going on around you. I personally like to go
killing King Crush and DVinn once in a while (2 mobs, around level 20), and
get the loot from them, and make some quests for the newbies with it as
reward.
Just too bad when no newbies seens even slightly interested. I stood in
treeform for 40 min at the Felwith entrance, sending out emotes that said i
was crying and with someone could help me, 5 newbie players hunting just
around me, and not even one of them tried to ask me if they could help.
After 40 min i got tired of waiting and sold the stuff to a vendor instead.
And to you other high level people, try to make quests for the newbies, much
more fun for both you and them than just giving the stuff away.
