FWIW, back in the day, even though it was FFA in Highpass, it very
rarely got ugly.  The orcs spawned fast enough back then (Ok, the
spawned at the same rate, but when a PGT and a Shiny Brass Halberd are

group of 17ish players) that there was enough to support two groups
and the competition always seemed friendly.
