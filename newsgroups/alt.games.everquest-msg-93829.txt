OK, any giants in GD/EW can drop them. I may be imagining it but they seem 
to drop more from the tougher giants. When I did that quest I killed loads 
of bulk standard frost giants and it took me forever in my low thirties.

I'm now level 48, and I've been helping a guildie with the shawl quests 
since I've been getting these things dropping anyway. I've been charm 
kiting stuff in EW recently (rhinos/mammoths etc - I'm a druid) and setting 
them on things like Kromriff Prison Guards, Kromriff Soldiers, Frost Giant 
Savages etc, and heads seem to drop a lot more often than from the lower 
level 'Frost Giants'. Toes are rarer - I got most toes from the giants in 
the Kromriff/Rygorr prison camp up by the Ulthork beach, but with nowhere 
near a large enough sample to say that they drop there more frequently than 
anywhere else.

Of course, depending on your class and level, you may have an easier time 
killing 3 or 4 frost giants than 1 Kromrif Prison Guard, I imagine they're 
a bitch to melee for example...
