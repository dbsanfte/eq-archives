Aye, I can certainly see how this can be a problem.  Especially if you're 
trying to farm it.  We were only there for exp, so killing the same mobs 
two or three times didn't seem like a bad thing.

Touche`.  Absolutely true.  If you're there for drops, all the info I saw 
would lead you to the south wing.  And it's not like rogues need more 
reasons to get into groups.  Wasn't the Kunark expansion about the time 
that rogues were so underwhelming though?  It's quite possible that this 
zone was designed to help give rogues a chance to get in groups and it has 
now outlived it's usefulness.  Of course you can still get good exp, and 
have a good time without going straight for the named mob, and I really 
think you're much more successful if you do that.

(Sidebar for those doing raid-level mobs, especially VP.  Have you ever 
been successful just pulling the names?  I can't get it through my GM's 
thick skull that a dozen or so warm-up mobs are at least as important as a 
perfect pull and perfect positioning.  Maybe it's just me, but even if I'm 
using bind-sight on the puller, I never feel properly ready when the big 
bastards come around the corner.)

I plan on going back to HS for exp once a week or so, and I'll be working 
on a small-group strategy I've been playing with, so I'll see how long it 
takes to get the other keys.  It may be that by my 3rd time there I 
absolutely hate it.
