Who said anything about forced?  Do you think that just because a certain item 
is in the game your entitled to it?  Gimme a break, there's plenty of content 
for players in the high levels out there withought them camping some rare drop 
off a lvl 9 mob, just to have bragging rights or to fill their pockets with pp.
This is the sole reason why gear sux until you hit 40.

And you raise an interesting point, being <forced> to play a certain way.  I 
think quite the opposite, there should be choices one needs to make and more 
importantly consequences for those choices...

If you want to be a fast leveler then maybe the penalty is gear is tougher to 
come by.  I see nothing wrong with that and why would someone assume the loot 
code would force them to do one over the other.
