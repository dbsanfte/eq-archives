Well they left out Tom Bombidil(sp?) which I thought was kind of
important. For one thing, that is where the hobbits all got their elf
or whatever blades (from the barrow wights treasure) Of course Frodo
later got sting from Bilbo.

The ents do figure kind of strongly in some stuff though, such as
saruman. I'm really hoping they don't omit them. Tom was a small part
of Fellowship and the only thing that part had to do with later stuff
was the other hobbits having nice swords and Frodo or someone asking
why Tom could not carry the one ring (since if you read fellowship you
find out exactly how much power it has over him) Gandalf explains why,
but if you omit the tom part you just leave that out. The ents are
quite different though since without them how will they explain
getting to saruman?

I'm hoping against hope that they don't omit the ents and instead have
Liv Tyler's character arwen (more or less nonexistant in the books)
come and rescue merry and pippen then blow up saruman's tower. Really
I'd almost expect them to do something horrible like that ahaha.
