I was never going to get involved in this skill, especialy as an enchanter I
felt no reason to. However after I hit 49th lvl I got all these cool enchant
spells. I quickly mastered the skill with all the little stuff, and now want
to make some cool armor to sell. I am still having trouble getting all the
components together to make the tempers. ( Wish I knew where I could just
buy the tempers allready made I need.) But I have a few questions. Like with
Qeynos (human ) armor. The recipes call for a Metal bar ( thats fine) but I
see no list of what happens when I use just enchanter bars of metal ( IE:
Enchanted Gold, or Platinum ) also I have not made any enchanted armor yet
(mostly because of difficulty getting components for tempers )  when I
enchant ore to make the enchanted folded metal, will it only work if I also
add an imbued gem too ?  or can I for example: Enchant 1 Platinum bar, and
enchant the steel to make the armor? will that be enough or will I have to
add an imbued stone too?  Also if I Enchant the Platinum can I make armor
w/o having to enchant the ore too, or if one metal is enchated does it all
have to be? I looked on Casters realm, planet everquest, and traders corner.
I still have not found this information..
