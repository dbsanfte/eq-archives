> Does anyone know what is up with Rangers Glade?

Well, I finally got a reply from our ISP:

"Thanks for your email. After extensive investigation we have determined
that the address you are trying to connect to are filtering certain ip
ranges. Yours and several others are being blocked at either the next router
hop or a firewall. You will need to speak to the people who run the site to
get this filtering removed for your range"

So it looks like either Interealms or their ISP are filtering OUR ip
addresses, rather than the other way round :/

This started happening in the last week, I guess I will need to mail Sunmoon
to see if he can shed any light :/

Even assuming it is true I cannot imagine that it is intentional!
