I don't feel that.  I think it very possibly could be at least partially 
genetic.  But I don't like that idea very much.

Well, I'm not 'taking a contrary position just for the sake of being 
contrary'.  I'm taking it 'just for the sake of' hoping to learn the flaws 
in that position.  However, by dodging the subject, I'm led to believe you 
see no flaws in it.  Ergo, homosexuality must be genetic.  Oh well.

Belief isn't an issue.  I don't have a belief on the subject.  Having a 
belief wouldn't make it any more or less true.  And it also would not help 
me find the truth.

You will never know.  But I have said so.  And how would my waffling harm 
you, were it to happen, anyway?

Really?  How many new threads have I started in other groups?  Umm... 
could it be ZERO?

Not at all.  But the question was intended for him.  And since you gave an 
answer that supported my point on his behalf, I thought he might not 
appreciate it much.  So you agree then, that they are gay ALL the time, 
except possibly when dead?  You theefre would agree that they can't 
magically stop being gay in a public place in the same way that Mr. 
Wizzard doesn't mystically cease to be a heterosexual?

}>Funny, I've heard of most of the events he mentioned in that post.  Can

Belief has nothing to do with it, that conversation is about facts. 
You know, science, all that rot.  And the genetic argument ay be BS or may 
not.  I, for one, would like to know.

}Can't argue with that sort of "logic"...

It's not there to be argued with, and it isn't "logic".  It's an 
obsrvation about the world and how it works.  No deductive reasoning at 
all, there.   But I'l put it another way for you:  I'm not gay, I'm a 
thespian. :)
