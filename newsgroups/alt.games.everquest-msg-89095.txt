Only real problem I had was in Dalnir where I fell down into the lower level
or something and I only had 40% hitpoints after falling and got killed
rather quickly by a mod.  When I come to I am naked in OT where I bound and
/petition that I knew I was had 100% health and that something was bugged
that I dies so quickly.  Note: I forgot that I had just fell and didn't
realize it to later.  Well anyway she rezzes me and was super polite, after
all they didn't have to do that cause it wasnt really a bug.

I'll also /petitioned a few times to have the brewer merchant in W FP reset
and withing 10-15 minutes she was back to her normal spot and vending again.

I am on Veeshan server btw.
