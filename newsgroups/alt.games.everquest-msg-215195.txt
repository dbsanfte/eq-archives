We shall see... all it would take is a microchip or OS revolution after 
EQ is out of 'active production'. Odds are they wouldn't go back and 
port it.

Once a new PC can't run it, support and subscribers will dwindle rapidly.

If they didn't many of them wouldn't return.

Besides EQ character records aren't very big. A few kb at most. A dozen 
stats, exp, coin, aas, a couple dozen skill levels, a few hundred 1-bit 
flags (AAs selected, PoP zone flags, etc, and few couple hundred item 
slots with (itemid, stack size/charges), a few dozen other numbers 
(current zone, buffs, loc, etc) and that's it.

The big stuff (e.g. maps is client side)

Being very generous at 5kb... with say 40 characters on the average 
account (well above anyone I've ever met) thats 200kb per account... 
times 10,000,000 accounts (far more than actual), and its still only 
2,000,000,000,000 bytes... A lousy 2TB. And that should be *way* *way* 
too high. Probably much less than a quarter of that....

Don't be overconfident that EQ will always be there. The day it stops 
making sense to run it, will be the day it stops being run. EQ2 is due 
out shortly, and that *will* suck the steam out of new subscriptions. 
After that subsriptions for EQ1 will gradually drop off, and the 
economies of scale will drop off with them.

Its probably 'Best of breed' today. But the genre still has a long way 
to go.   Everquest can and will be eclipsed by something better.
