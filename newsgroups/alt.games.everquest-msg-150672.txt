Um, no.  I haven't even made it to the upper end of the game.  I have
really enjoyed playing a wizard up to lvl 50.  That's why I keep
tossing my money at VI/SOE.  It's FUN.  Period.  I suspect there are
many others in the same boat.  Maybe this isn't the game for you. 
Move along little doggie.  CIHYS?
