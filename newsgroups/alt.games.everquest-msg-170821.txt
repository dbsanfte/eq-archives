  As someone who has a 47 monk along with my druid and have grouped
with both good and bad bards (as well as every other class). I
understand what they can do, I spend a lot of time browsing newsgroups
and ezBoards as well as web sites for all my characters.  This is my
second bard, the other never got past 14 because I didn't always have
a lot of time for groups and soloing was slow and dangerous.  I know
bards really start coming into thier own in the mid 30's and up.  I
was planning on using him to group with my monk when the bard hit's
32.  this will help me learn the class without worrying about anyone
dying except the bard.
  We all know people in thier 40's or 50's who still have no clue
about the game dynamics ( healing aggro, proximity aggro, sitting
aggro). I still run into people that don't know how to single pull
using line-of-sight.  Or monks that don't know where to use sneak when
doing a Vox CR.
  I'm not worried about me playing my bard poorly, if anything I'll
decide it's too much work and stop playing him.
  Thanks for the input everyone.
