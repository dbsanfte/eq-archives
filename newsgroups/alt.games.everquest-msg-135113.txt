    Here's the problem, though. If your item is priced the same as the
others, why is someone going to pick you? The only way to make sure that, if
there's limited buyers, your item will sell is to undercut the others. And
given the pressure on some folks to sell - the HUGE influx of new items on
the market, the only way to purchase them being plat, produces pressure to
buy and upgrade - people will do it.
