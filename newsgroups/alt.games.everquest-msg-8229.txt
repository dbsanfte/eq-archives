It is a very tough class to play well.  I played a bard into
his teens, and quit when i started getting carpal tunnel
symptoms.  When it started to physicallly hurt to play the
character I quit.  I have a feeling there is a high burnout
rate, because unlike most classes who can take a break
during "down" time, a bard is generally expected to still
twist heal, and mana songs.
