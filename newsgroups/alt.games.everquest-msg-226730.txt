I was *so* excited the first time I joined a PON group.  I found it
exasperating.  People kept going AFK, members changing, FFA loot which I
thought just absolutely sucked, (being as I was the cleric).  AND I felt like I
couldn't just *leave* because I thought it was boring.  So I stuck around for 3
hours wanting to rip my hair out.  
I love LDoN too.... :)
