Exactly.  I leave Hide Traders on all the time.  Even in the new Bazaar,
it makes a noticeable difference in reducing lag.  (Heck, even if I'm
down in the bank area, turning off Hide Traders increases the lag for
some reason.  I guess the engine has to figure out whether any of those
newly visible traders are in my line of sight.)  So when I set up my
trader, I have no idea whether I'm in someone else's spot, or face, or
whatever.

And has been pointed out many times (but bizbee seems more interested in
continuing to flame than in acknowledging it), as long as the BUYER has
Hide Traders on, it makes no difference whether your trader is stacked
with half a dozen others.  Now, I'll grant that some buyers are clueless
and don't know about Hide Traders, especially since the default width of
the /bazaar window is too narrow to show that button, but still, bizbee
needs to take a valium or something.

Oh, and once you assume that most traders have Hide Traders on, then it's
no surprise that traders are stacked up a lot.  I turned traders visible
and ran around the bazaar on my server a bit, checking where people tend
to stand.  No surprise: the most crowded rooms are the ones that you come
to first when entering from the hub.  I.e., people do their banking or
whatever, then run off to the nearest trader area and set up shop.  Not
only that, but they tend to stand either on the nearest piece of trader
floor to the entry hall, or around the middle of a section of floor, which
are exactly the two places I expected to see the most crowding.

So my advice to bizbee (besides the valium) is that he should get into the
habit of running to a less commonly picked place.  E.g., run down a hall
from the bank area, turn right to get to a different quadrant, and stand
about 2/3 of the way from the hallway out of that section.  I do find that
picking a standard orientation like that makes it easier for me to keep
track of which hallway leads back to the bank vs leading to other trader
rooms.  (The hallway leading to the bank is always in the quadrant just
counterclockwise from the quadrant that has no hallway.)
