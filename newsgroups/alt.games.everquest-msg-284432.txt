That first attack isn't really an attack, its a Harm Touch; the mobs are 
Shadowknights, and get one HT per hour or so, but unlike player SK, who 
general hold HT in reserve as an emergency "closer", they open with 
it... which makes some sense, as its unlikely they will survive.

Letting a pet absorb the HT if you have a player tank is a great plan, 
its usually a significantly bigger hit than the usual, and its easy to 
get the mob off the pet once thats done, since the mob will hit any PC 
in melee range instead.

Slowed is a technical term meaning that the mob hits less often; its the 
opposite of hasted.  If you are using fear on a mob, slowed won't really 
help much, since he won't be hitting anyone, just running away.

Snared is another technical term, meaning that the mob runs more slowly; 
if you are using fear, its very very helpful to snare him, since he 
won't move as far and your melee and pets (which are melee too) will 
spend more time in melee range of his back, beating on him.

A necro's darkness line; clinging darkness, engulfing darkness, and the 
like, are snares, not slows (they are also DOTs, which for the most part 
is IMO, unfortunate)

At your level, you'd have to have a pretty impressive 1hb to do more DPS 
with it than you would sitting down and medding up for another nuke or 
DOT.  Not that there's anything wrong with having some fun and meleeing 
instead, far be it from someone playing an SK to put down someone's 
desire to make a mob run and then hit it when it can't defend itself... 
but if you're trying for the best possible kills per hour, you're 
probably better off sitting.

If you can afford a mount, you're almost certainly better off getting 
one of the various clicky nuke items and chaining it while getting sit 
med benefit.

This is particularly true because that snared mob not only runs slowly 
away from you, but then when fear wears off, runs slowly back to you. 
This means you only have to fear him half the time, and yet your pet 
(with taunt off) and dots are working the whole time.  Fear him just 
before he gets to you.  This is much better than wasting your time 
chasing him, only to have to fear immediately when fear breaks because 
he's already right on top of you!
