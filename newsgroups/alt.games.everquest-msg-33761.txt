I feel so ashamed for looking at these and knowing these loop holes in the
game but saying that I shall be heading to Qeynos tonight to take full
advantage of these before they are nerfed.

Not even that accurate, Cros has been dead for months, so only Holly to look
out for.
Priestess Caulria is the person you are looking for, she's the ugly looking
one (I mean it, take a good look at he next time)

Gnoll teeth can be handed in 1 at a time, 4 are only needed for the the
Barbarian version, I believe.

Here's another Cheat, kill Sarnak Beserkers in OT and collect the braids
(only useful if you are not KoS in the Outpost) hand 4 of the braids to the
Captian Rottgrime (skeleton captain) and he'll give you Exp and a crap
shield (unless you have one already)
OK nothing new there but did you know (ok you probably did) that if someone
does not hand the right amount in, say someone hands 3 in, the next person
can hand in 1 braid and get the exp. Easy way to check, hand in 4, if after
the You Gained Experience message he says "keep up the good work" count how
many times he said that and that's how many extra braids he has, if he says
it twice you only need to give him 2 more to get exp. Of course you only get
to do this once until someone hands in the wrong amount again but it saves
you a couple of braids.
