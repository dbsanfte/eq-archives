Leader was a lame load. Especially if he doesn't know how to use the
various classes in a group. Looking at who was in your group, who was
your snarer? Plus he could be emergency healer, his undead slow spell
would lower the need for as many heals when dealing with such MoBs.
His pet could engage an add, ect...

My 54 druid always groups with a 56 necro all the time in dungeons we
can handle all the named in lower Guk, just the two of us and his pet.
We clear the undead snakes and golems at the front of the temple in
The Grey.

A lot of this "snobbery" just comes from this "ultimate" group
non-sense where some people believe only x,y, and z make good groups.
I've was in a Kael bank group with 56 necro, 58 SK, 43 Sk, and myself,
54 druid and we did fine with only a few close calls. It's about
knowing the game and the limitation of the classes and what they are
good at and bad at. You'd be surprised what you can accomplish with
the "bad for group" players when you have people who know how to play
the game and the class :-).
