> Some ideas that are obvious, but you never know....

One other thing is to get organized. Go through the the spell
research lists and find out which words you ACTUALLY will need
for spells you want. There are a lot of red-herring words out
there that are useless. Use one row of bank boxes to put them in
alphabetical order so you know what you have, what you need
etc... doing this saved me a lot of headache I'm sure.
