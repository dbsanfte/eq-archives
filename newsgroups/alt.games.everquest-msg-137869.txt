It could be a bug.  I suspect that the ability to do cross-server chat came
in as part of the implementation of player-created channels.  They wanted
player channels to work across zones, which means they needed to work with
players playing on different physical servers.

The logical way to do this is to make a general distributed chat system,
very similar to IRC, and have all the EQ servers as part of it, using a
channel naming convention to map the user-visable channel names to the
internal names used by the "real" chat system.

Unless they actually say that they meant for this to be available to
players, it's possible that the client was supposed to filter things and
only allow you to participate in your server's channels, but someone forgot
this, or botched the implementation.

Anyway, I wouldn't get too attached to cross-server chat yet.
