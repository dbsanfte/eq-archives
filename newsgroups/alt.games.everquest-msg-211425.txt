Sorry Dennis, but I've played plate classes running around at levels
30-45 _without_ insane equipment, and I've always tanked noticeably
better than any non-twink Ranger unless the Ranger was _both_ several
levels above me and obsessed with acquiring AC gear (note I start at
30, not 20, Paladin/SK gets barely any more HP/level than Ranger at
level 25 and below).
