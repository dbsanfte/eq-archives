When I play EQ sometimes the computer screen will go black and it seems to
have frozen,I think.
I can't do anything .Esc wont work and Ctr-Alt-Delete is no help.
I have to re-boot my computer to get it running.
I have downloaded the new drivers for my video card(s).
I have noticed that sometimes after I log off or if I go into windowed mode
and drop EQ into the tray there is a yellow triangle with an "!" in it in
the system tray saying that my virtual memory is low.
Could this be my culprit?
How big should my virtual memory be?

My system is :

AMD Athlon 2600+
768 MB Ram
128 MB Video card(looks like 2-64 MB Radeon 9200)
running on Windows XP Home

Any help would be appreciated.
