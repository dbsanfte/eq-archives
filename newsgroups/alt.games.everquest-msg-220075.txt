OK, lets look.  EQ's been around for quite a while and has a
large and vocal following; people who like games that run the way
it does now are already captured.

But there's a huge section of the population who are turned off
by stuff like a sense heading skill that doesn't work until you
hit level 39 (*the point at which your compass stops floating. 
For the sake of the arrow on the map, you get that by level 38,
perhaps 37 I wasn't looking).  Will fixing all the little
annoyances which eventually vanish as you level up snare the
people who start the game (often with a free month) and then quit
in disgust?

Maybe not, maybe thats a lost cause, but your post makes me
suspect that the group you are writing off is indeed the one they
are going after now.

Bergh

ps of course the danger is that they risk losing the people they
have already snared... now they have to weigh maybe getting new
people versus maybe losing old ones.
