While that may be true if the packaging claims "Supports windows 2000",
which here, at least, it does, I would think that if it doesnt work

That said, this statement is also true ;) I've got w2k and while I'm happy
with it its poopy for everquest. Has anybody got any tips about hwo to get
windows 98 running alongside it? (I have old windows 98 cd's kicking about
too)

I'd appreciate any help ;)
