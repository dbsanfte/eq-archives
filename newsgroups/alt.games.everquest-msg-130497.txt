That's fine, that's your choice.  I also shop at 7-11.  I also don't read
the playboys.  In this case, though, I choose to ask Cox not to carry the
groups.  I think it refects poorly on Cox users, and I don't want to be
associated with it.  I know I can "just leave," but I think I have a right
to see about getting a satisfactory resolution before I go that road.
