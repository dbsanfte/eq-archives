Just how are bard songs implemented??

I know for an absolute fact they aren't 18 seconds, because 2 buffs will 
drop at the same instance, when they were cast at least 3.5 seconds 
apart, so I know they drop at ticks, not seconds.

And some songs seem to consistently last less time than others.
On possible explanation is that some songs last 4 ticks, gauranteeing 
you 18 seconds, but lasting up to 23 depending on when they landed 
within a tick. While other songs last 3 ticks, granting you at most 18 
seconds, and a minimum of 13.

I'm pretty sure it works something like this, because some songs I can 
pretty consistently 5 twist, (needing around 17.5 seconds (giving a 0.5 
buffer between songs) and some I just can't, because I need 17.5 seconds 
and I've got 13-18.

If lull is in the latter category, 13 gauranteed seconds isn't a big 
window of opportunity... I expect under decent circumstances you'll only 
reliably be able to pull from groups of 4, lulling three and pulling the 
4th. If you try to pull from 5 it will look like this, at best...

1) First lull lands, and you now have 13 seconds to get out...
2) 3.5 seconds later 2nd lull lands, you now have 9.5 seconds.
3) 3.5 seconds later 3rd lull lands, you now have 6.0 seconds.
4) 3.5 seconds later 4th lull lands, you now have 2.5 secodns.

Not enough time to cast a final song to pull (so if you want to chant 
pull you can only lull 3)... ranged attacks could work, but even so 
you've got to get the mob out of aggro range of the first one in less 
than 2 seconds and that's going to be tight...and depending on mob 
placement this may not be possible at all (it also means that pulling 
with slow is not going to be possible), which is a pain for me, because 
that is one of my preferred pulling songs, as it gives everyone time to 
debuf, shoot, etc, and still give us time to give taunt to the MT, and 
even if it does go awry its only hitting at half speed making it easier 
to recover from.

I might have overestimated slightly on 0.5 between songs, it may be as 
low as 0.25 but that really only buys us another 1 second, and requires 
us to be even more on the ball...and eliminates any margin for error or lag.

This could seriously affect bard pulling strategy and effectiveness. I 
don't need 5 minutes... but 13 seconds is just really tight. I'm really 
hoping its the 4 tick version where it lasts at *least* 18 seconds.

Thoughts??
