Of the changes I've seen grapically in EQ I have to say I really like the new
look of the skeletons (human skeletons that is). The only thing that detracts
from them is that they no longer attack anything anymore. Oh they cause damage
still, it's just that they don't move when they do it. Is Verant going to fix
this? or are they going to leave it as is like they did with the silent sarnaks
and kunark rhino's?

PS. Is it just me or does the new wolf form look like a cross between a puppy
and something small and squeaky that keeps jumping?
