Actually, looking back, it was YOUR example as well..

Geeeee  Doesn't THAT paint you in a totally objective light..


RS uses the rape analogy...

YOU use the rape analogy...

But when *I* refer to it in my response, all of the sudden it "falls a
bit short"...

So, lemme understand this..

YOU use an analogy and it's prefectly fine..

When *I* refer to it to SUPPORT what you are saying, all of the sudden
it, "falls a bit short"...

Does that about sum things up??

Go ahead...  Now is when you say "I didn't say that!!!"

But those are YOUR words, quoted verbatim...

Simply shows you for the hypocrite that your posts make you out to
be..
