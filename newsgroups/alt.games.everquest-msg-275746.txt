Several years ago I joined this newsgroup and started a few threads.
One was "Why newbies beg," where I tried to defend beggars, and another
was about the ability of wizards to solo in PvP. I read my old posts
again yesterday and I feel very guilty.

In "Why newbies beg" I took it very seriously about winning the
argument. I lost my temper after I assumed I was the target of everyone
else's attacks. This was because I chose the name Sephiroth. (More on
that below.) My biggest apology goes to Lokari, who bore the brunt of
my rage when I called him an idiot over and over again in one post. But
my biggest mistake was bringing commandments into the discussion. I was
not being respectful to religion or religious people.

In another thread I started about wizards, I pitched another fit, this
time about the name Sephiroth. It was foolish of me to take a Final
Fantasy character so seriously. I chose the digits 416214 in my name
because of a melody I liked in the final boss theme. I was unwilling to
confront it in my mind after I chose the screen name, and as much as I
loved it I was always defensive about it. That is why I got so angry. I
secretly liked that melody.

When I was young I was teased for having long hair. Then I played Final
Fantasy 7, and for a long time after I beat it, Sephiroth was my only
friend. From now on I will try to be more understanding about the
difference between fantasy and reality.
