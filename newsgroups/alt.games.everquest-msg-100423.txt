>Ok, this is just my opinion, but you know what I'd gladly pay $3 more per
>month for? 

Would you be bitching if it went like this......

Ruins of Kunark Lauches....EQ goes up to 10.89
Scars of Velious Launches...EQ goes up to 11.89
Shadows of Luclin Launches...EQ goes up to 12.95

EQ has been running for 3 years now......

What if the price had gone up 1 dollar each year?

EQ is more than 30% better than it was when it launched and we all
happily paid $9.89 for it then. I don't see a problem paying 30% more
for a game that is 300% or more better than when it started.

Raising the price makes sense considerring how much the game has
grown. Obviously the players have not grown much. They still cry like
infants when the big mean forces of change spank them on the ass.

Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.
