I have the same router.

Sounds to me like you are on a PPoE connection. Many ISP's have an 'Idle
TimeOut' for these leased IP addresses. EQ may not be sending the correct
'keepalive' signals through the router.

Make sure you have assigned the router your 'real' IP (from your ISP) or
configured it for PPoE, then have it dole out internal IP addresses
(10.10.10.2 through 10.10.10.10 is what I use) via DHCP to your connected
machines. The router will convert these local addresses to the real one and
continually notify your ISP that your connection is active.

I don't have PPoE so I could be (and most likely am) completely off-base.

By default the router has no filters set, so it will accept traffic from
anyone.
