Pretty much, I would of prefered SoV or VoG, but you make due with
what you can get sometimes.

In exp groups archery has very few problems but it's not flawless.
You can have a mob in a wide open space and your arrows will just
not hit no matter how much you shoot, then you move a bit to the
left or right, and you're hitting again.  Some exp spots are in narrow
places as well, but for most exp groups I am in, archery is dandy.

I'd rather be doing in the area of monk/rogue damage without the need to
spend 48aa on it with no restrictions as to if and when it works.  Last I checked
Monks and Rogues already do.

One day I may decide to parse the Thunderbolt with avatar, but if you have a means
to keep avatar up on yourself, you probably have a better bow anyway.
