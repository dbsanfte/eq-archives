(Frankenstein.)

1) Yes, I didn't see it.

2) Frankenstein wasn't a great necromancer of fantasy; he was the first of
the scientific view of necromancy.  Admitted, this qualifies him as
"agnostic", but he didn't use spells to raise the dead; he used science.
The nearest equivalent you might create in EQ would be someone who uses
alchemical potions to animate the dead.  You'll never get a
Frankenstein-form who can create undead from a single chip of bone.
