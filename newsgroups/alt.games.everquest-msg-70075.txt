I recall seeing that explained by them. In my dim memory, they
observed that they had no idea there were going to be so many servers,
and so allowed 8 so that people would be able to try a large variety

>Many of the "Best" items in the game are not "No Drop"

Which could easily be attributed to their stated desire for a robust
player driven economy.

>I am not against "twinking".
