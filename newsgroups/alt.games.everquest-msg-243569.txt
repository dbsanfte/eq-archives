We aren't talking about the real world. We are talking about a GAME. Games 
are supposed to be fair, with the only advantage coming from the effort you 
have put into it(either as skill or, in this case, as advancement).

In a space where they have worked to get that money, nothing.

Three cheers for apples and oranges comparisons.

The point of a game is to pit another players luck or skill agains each 
other. Better equipment can help- note that I am not bitching about people 
who can afford better video cards, etc, than I can. 

If you'd like to continue your "golf equipment" analogy/strawman, you are 
saying that a new set of clubs is the same as paying a caddy to sneak you 
in on the back 9 with a trumped-up well under par score.

Yes, I suppose you can. We call this "fraud".

Not in a legal sense it isn't.

Hey, I know you... You were that "Who can own a rock" guy from Crocodile

Trying to turn this into some overblown philosophical discussion is 
asinine. You are attempting to blur the word "own" which (aside from 
flights of fancy you may take) can be agreed upon by everyone here as 
conforming with what the law says. You do not legally own the gear, nor the 
character, nor the account, and thus selling any of these things is fraud 
and theft.
