Hi guys,

I got a 25 warrior and am trying to build up a cleric (already lvl 14) 
but what I'm trying to do is to find a way to make good plat or doable 
quests which don't involve no drop items at the end of the quest (so I 
can get it to my alt) so that I can get both decent (not necessarily 
twinked to the max) plat and equipment for the cleric. I'm building up 
my cleric to become my main so that the guild has some solid healers 
(typical guild - always looking for clerics) but no one in the guild is 
of a high enough level yet (our top 10 ranges from 60 to 45 - so still 
at the levels where they are just becoming strong themselves).

Any tips would be greatly appreciated.

Matt

P.S. The warrior is a barbarian and the cleric is a High Elf (Tunare).
