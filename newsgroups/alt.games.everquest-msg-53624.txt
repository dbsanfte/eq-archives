I sort of have two favorites.  My all time favorite is my main a 42
rogue.  He is very group dependant however so when short on time or
feeling anti social i will play my 31 Druid, who also groups much of the
time, but is ideal for short stints of solo play, with ports and sow i
can get most places i want to go quickly, and in an outdoor zone I am
one of the better solo classes.
