It's a joke to think that there is a liberal bias in the media.  Look at who
owns the media and what agenda they would prefer to push.  I would say that
other than a few small newspapers, the all media is controlled by
conservatives.  How many "liberal" talk show hosts have been trotted out
since Donohue?  Oprah or  Rosie?  Neither of them discussed politics (but
Rosie annoyed the hell out of the religio-rights).  I would guess that the
number is fewer than a 10 in the last 10 years (including the self-professed
"moderate" Alan Colmes).
