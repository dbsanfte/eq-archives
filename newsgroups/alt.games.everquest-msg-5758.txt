This is not really a good characterization of the phenomena in question and
after thinking about it a minute I think that the non melee classes got
screwed .

What actually happens is that all the combat classes get a level determined
bonous dammage to any sucessfull whack . At high levels this bonous is very
significant and is why a 3-8 weapon does far more dammage than a 30-50 one.
The dammage bonous only applies to the primary hand though .

For the balance question I would much prefer the non combat classes to be
MUCH more effective in hand to hand than they are now. Not quite as
effective as eq caster mobs are but far more than the casters are now.
