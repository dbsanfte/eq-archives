You must have unlimited time to play, then. Those of us with jobs and families

to attend to usually have limited amounts of time per session and if you die
towards the end of a session, the corpse lays there until the next time you
can get on.

Really, did you think that all of those corpses lying around Norrath were
people
who had just been killed? Nothing can bother a corpse anyway, so leaving it
lying around "with all your gear on it" is meaningless. It's not like random
people
are going to come along and loot your corpse while you're offline.

Heck, my corpse is currently being camped by a Brownie Scout. I had the
misfortune to die near it's spawn point, apparently. If it wasn't for the fact
that
totally naked corpses rot quickly, I'd have a whole pile of them sitting in
Lesser
Faydark right now... I can't afford the time to dedicate to just "camping out"
in
the game until I either figure out how to get my corpse without getting killed

or get some help with it. In the end, my corpse will lie there on the path
until
the weekend, most likely, as a warning to fellow travelers  that something
nasty is in the area. *heh*
