Please go back and point out where I referred directly, or even
indirectly, to the OP as a "n00b". Oh,... wait. You can't because I
didn't. These are opinions being posting in this thread. And here, as
well as Graffe's and many other places you'll find lots of folks who
thing that, while wizards could use a few additional boosts, they are
far from broken and a desirable character in any situation. The OP is,
IMO, in the minority on this one, though welcome to his opinion.

That said, being an officer in OoooberGuild=01, or even playing since
Beta_xxx does not make somebody a master at any class. The OP's comments
demonstrate a remarkable lack of grasp of the many things a wizard
brings to the table in various situations, and a very one dimensional
("I don't do enough DPM so wizards all suck") type of attitude.

Glay you guys are so Oo00ber, though. But somehow I feel slighted.
Werene't you supposed to also tell me that you're going to come "pwn"
me? I've been short changed!
