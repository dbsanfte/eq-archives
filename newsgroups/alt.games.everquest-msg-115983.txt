I suppose they could but I would argue it.  Not using anything that's not
meant to be used that way.  /pet guard here wouldn't be there if it was
something that would be exploitable.  Besides, I would go and clean up
the corpses and rebuff the pet every few pages so it's not like I wasn't
here playing.  Kinda gets me thinking though and I really can't see
where they could call it an exploit.  Or even breaking any rules.  But
then again, who knows what GM will decide there is or isn't a rule for
or against something like that.  And just a side note, I only did this at
the odd hours when I was the only one in the zone.  If anyone else was
in there I would wander around whichever side was empty or just group
up for faction since noone really ever goes in there for exp.
