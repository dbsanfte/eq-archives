You are leaving out the focus III items, don't recall which one you 
mentioned having in particular, but, I have to assume, being a wizard, that 
it is one that is useful for DD spells.  As far as aggro issues, that is 
certainly a concern, like I said, my knowledge level of wizards is pretty 
minimal, just comes from grouping with them, and posts here.

Also, counting in recast time of 2.5 seconds on each, that's 5.5 seconds 
per Draught vs 6.5 for Ice Spear.  So, in the time it takes you to cast 26 
Draughts, you could cast 22 Ice Spears.  That's 24700 damage from Draughts 
vs 26400 from Ice Spears in the same amount of time for less mana.  Add in 
any of the Focus effects you have for 60 and under spells, and that just 
increases that efficiency.  Agro would still be an issue however.  In that 
same time, by switching between the two, you could (assuming enough mana of 
course) do 43000 damage.  All of that is assuming maximum efficiency on 
recasting, but, the human delays between casting as well as the network 
delays should more or less balance out in the end.

I am genuinely curious what I am missing here in looking over the spells 
that makes you feel that Drought is more efficient.  In the end, the only 
issue I can still see would be aggro, and I don't know enough about the 
differences in aggro level of the various wizard spells.

Regardless, in the end, fun is what it's all about, not min maxing.
