You might not have cannibalize but HP/AC is still useful in the early
levels because even back then tanking is almost always your best
option. You can solo quite well by throwing on a dot or two, meleeing
the mob down and (until 19th lvl) using inner fire as a super
efficient downtime heal. So even at lower levels HP/AC > Wis. There is
a span in the high 20s - low 30s where Wisdom is argueably more
useful.

Hell, you won't even accept the fact that there's an overwhelming
consensus out there for a shaman using HP/AC gear, something you could
figure out if you spent 5 minutes scanning the shaman boards. Why
waste my time trying to convince you of anything? 

Have a nice day, I'm done with this converstation.
