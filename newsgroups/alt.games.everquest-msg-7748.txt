Agreed, it *is* a welcome addition, and one I've wanted to see for a while.
It is a minor yet significant little addition that breathes a touch of life
into the world, and that is *always* good. The idea that something might
have changed is always an inspiration to spend more time in the city than
one's usual "I must bolt in and bank before the beggars corner me" trip.

After speaking to all of a city's NPCs once, it becomes rather pointless to
ever do it again, unless you're questing. It would be nice for that to no
longer be the case.
