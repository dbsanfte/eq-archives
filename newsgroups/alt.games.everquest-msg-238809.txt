 the ranger
(who I used to be guilded with, but hadn't played with since I was 62 or
so on my mage) called for an evac as soon as she saw all the mobs - the
druid is used to simply hitting exodus when she see's the call.
Her comment
after was "Sorry, forgot who I was playing with."

 In a group where you know the other players of course you learn each other's
playing styles and habits and of course you can handle much tougher situations
and I totally agree with you.  I'll do Hard LDONs all *day* with my friends and
win or lose we have a blast just on the adreneline rush and each other's
company and the challenge.
The situation *THIS* thread was based on was a group full of strangers that
weren't even responding to each other in the group and the only one pushing
themselves was the cleric.
