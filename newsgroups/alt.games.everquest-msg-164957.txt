Hadda be that baseball game from my "programming" class in Highschool 
(early 80's).  On a TRaSh-80.  Kinda cool when I printed the source, 
modified it, and bet another guy I could beat him.  (Made it virtually 
impossible, okay COMPLETELY impossible, for him to get a hit, while I 
never made less than a triple!)
