Your problem is that the Fell Blade is the SK guild.  The necro guild is
back near the bank, from the bank, go out and follow the grass to the left
and around the building with alchemy? supplies in it, turn right, go through
the arch, then you'll se an area with ghosts, go through the iron gate, and
back in that building is where you want.
