Actually, there IS some physical risk from EQ addiction.  I've always
had a late-night personality -- staying up to 1-2am and sometimes much
later -- but until I ran into EQ I could generally rely on catching up
on sleep every once in a while, as if I got too sleep-deprived I'd just
go to bed at 11pm or midnight and sleep till noon, etc.

But with EQ, I find I'm rarely in bed before 3am any more, and since I
do have a day job it can get to be a problem.  More than once I've had
to force myself to say, No, I won't just log in "for a few minutes" to
kill a few mobs or do a little tradeskilling or whatever, I'll got to
bed dammit.  And even so, I'm definitely getting less sleep than I used
to.

But I'm enjoying it! :-)
