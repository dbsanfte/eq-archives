It's called puberty. Get a girlfriend, and stop trolling. Perhaps you
can ask that girl in metal shop out, the one with the one eyebrow. (No
offense to the one eyebrow people out there, he's gotta date someone!)

I had some sympathy for this guy once. I think it was the "its-a
bug-cause-mobs-kill-me-when-LD-and-they-are-2-lzy-to-fix-it-dude"
troll that turned me.
