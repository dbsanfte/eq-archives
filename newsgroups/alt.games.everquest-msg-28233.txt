I don't know. It kinda smells like a troll.. but. Anyway, I'm not 
entirely SURE that guides CAN perform in-game weddings. The last one I 
had we had to petition then email the GM. Why would a guide get to do 
it? They can't even change the name... all names must be changed by a GM 
as far as I know.
