Here's
> what i'm looking for:
Best spot for a necro to get exp from 44-49 is in the dreadlands.  Head over
to the plaguebone thieves.  They spawn inside a pyrmid and are very easy to
pull, pull with a spell and you will always get one.  Use sense undead to
target them & you won't have to worry about getting too close and aggroing a
bunch of em.

Nope

I wouldn't call it highly contested, but expect some competition
> 5. I'd love it if it wasn't a lot of wandering mobs
