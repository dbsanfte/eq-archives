Once upon a time, Tiru was part of this family. And he went through a 
lot of trials and tribulations as a cleric with his buddy Jakugg. This 
family supported him through all of the early stages of his epic, but 
there were certainly not enough folks around willing to help him with 
Chardok. (This was back in the old days, when not many folks had gotten 
that high level. This family has grown a great deal since then. :) ) 
Tiru learned of the Coldain Prayer Shawls, and looked at his tailoring 
skill (null). He thought of his frustration, and felt it was time to 
step back, and let the next generation take his place. He sought a 
protege, and found it in his neice Tarre.

Tarre grew very strong. Stronger than Tiru ever was or wanted to be. And 
she dragged *him* everywhere with her. Eventually, she repaid him for 
the twinks, by giving him gifts in exchange. Tiru still came out, when 
he heard whispers of the Royalty of Chardok, but usually the evening 
ended in frustration, anger, and bitter words.

Lately, a new breeze has been blowing. The compatriots the dark elf had 
found were even stronger than she is. And the wanted poster for the 
Chardok Royals appeared in the Guildhall.

Tiru read the notice and smiled. For the first time, in a long time, he 
held hope in his heart. He mounted his new sturdy pony, and rode off to 
the fight. Three other clerics were there. One had her water-sprinkler. 
Another was ineligble for being too new and untrusted. The last was a 
cleric that appeared more often in Norrath. The first fight was clean 
and over. And the compatriots agreed to stay again for another. And so 
Tiru was permitted to receive his award.

Tiru rode his pony over to Nagafen's Lair, and found his way to wait for 
Zordak. He stayed for most of the day, but he had his pearl.

Now, he had seen the dragon Ragefire before, when he was deformed and 
dropped two of his hearts. So he could, if he wished, simply run and do 
a few hand ins. But the compatriots wished to watch the dragon die, so 
they were duly gathered. The dragon died with only one death, in less 
than 30 seconds.

Tiru gathered a few close friends- the wizard Jakiss, and the druid 
Lenanya- and made the long trip into Timorous Deep. After a solemn 
ceremony, he now weilds his Water Sprinkle of Nem-Ankh with pride.
