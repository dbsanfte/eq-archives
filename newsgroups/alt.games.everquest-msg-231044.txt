This was very likely in regard to Velious factions, and it's been that 
way for a long time. When guild first start getting up to the point of 
raiding in Velious, there are three factions to be concerned with: 
dorfs, giants, and dragons. Generally, guilds would pick which, between 
dorf and giants, they wanted to be on and raid accordingly. Either could 
get you CoV faction. (Dragons) It used to be that some of the best armor 
you could get was the quest armor either from the dwarves in Thurg, or 
from the Giants in Kael, so you'd pick one and murder the other to gain 
faction. Your next step past that was often to be moving into dragon 
lands. ToV halls of testing, for example. And if you're going to be 
running around there at an early stage, non-KOS dragon faction was a 
blessing, allowing you to get around without getting ganked by big nasties.

However, the guild eventually reaches a point where they want to move on 
to even bigger and better loot. This might mean moving into ToV North, 
or Sleeper's Tomb. Either way, you're going to have to start murdering 
some of the CoV dragons to get what you want. Every first brood dragon 
kill can be a pretty bad hit on your CoV faction. It's technically 
possible (and has been done) to keep doing Kael or Dwarf raids to keep 
your non-KOS status with the dragons while you are hunting them, but 
eventually it just gets to be too much of a pain in the butt and the 
guild ceases to "care" about their dragon faction standing, as every 
time they see one after that, they are most likely on the way to kill it 
anyhow. If the guild you are joining is at that stage, it might be nice 
for you to get your Coldain faction up in case you want to get some of 
the dwarf armor, or be able to easily shop and bank in Thurgadin (really 
not much of an issue these days if you have PoP expansion and book 
access to the PoK resources) but your CoV faction isn't going to matter 
a ton to you if you're going to wade in and start slaughtering first 
broods. (Klandicar, Zlandicar, etc. etc.)
