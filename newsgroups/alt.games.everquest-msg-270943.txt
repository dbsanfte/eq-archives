I did a lot of Ldons in the 50ies with my cleric,often just me and
some melees,no slower/haster or crowd controller available.
This caused some downtime,the concept of bind wound was
unheard of by almost all players in pickupgroups,not that I was
the only one who had bandages  *AND* a useful skill level in
bindwound,despite of telling them not to move while I bw them,
they often moved  senseless for no reason.
I had some absurd discussions with players,while recovering how
*useless* bw is,telling me 50 hps means nothing.The idea,that if we
had *all* bw skill and bandages would make recovery *much* faster,
was even laughed at.
Lately toying around with a  (mildly twinked with 400 hps gear)
Enchanter in Kurns Tower,it reduces downtime to the amount I need
to bw up to 70%,while at the same time recovering more mana than I
really need,I have to use the awful level 8 nuke,or I would be fm all
the time.Just dinged 16 there,starting today,when i just had dinged
10,not bad for estimated 4 hours effective playtime.
All in all a very useful skill up to the mid-50ies since you can bw
up to 70%.
