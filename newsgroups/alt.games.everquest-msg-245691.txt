if an item, such as a shissar fang or a hermit crab, increases a skill, does
that mean that if you stack them on top of eachother they will increase the
skill twice as much?  for example, a shissar fang gives +5 str, so 2 stacked
shissar fangs should give you +10 str, right?  i would just buy another one
and find out, but the only ones in the bazaar right now are 5pp, and i just
spent my last cent...
