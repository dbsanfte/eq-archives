    My pally friend used to lose objects that were stored -in- backpacks
whenever he died. He thought it was a feature of the game until one day he
admonished me to fetch my corpse quickly after a death before things started
vanishing out of my packpacks and I said: "Huh?". He eventually got a whole
heap of stuff returned by a GM and the problem vanished. Being that we were
low level when the problem was happening and he finally got his gear back
(IIRC) in his late 40's, the stuff was mostly worthless, but there was one
10 dose blood of the wolf in there and a few other vaguely valuable things.

    I don't really have a point I'm just relating an experience. A weird
one. <twilight zone music>
