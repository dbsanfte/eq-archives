You're right on both counts. (I focused on the newsgroups part of it,
obviously) Those messageboards I have read - and this includes all games -
have generally tended to be far more juvenile and far more heated than
UseNet. And that's saying a lot.

Oh, I have no problem with it, I just don't understand it. Was completely
dumbfounded by it, actually, and finally decided to ask. It reminds me of
the folks who shout to the zone when they have leveled, a comparison I think
I made earlier. Why do the people that do that think the zone cares that
they hit level 8? Or do they realize the zone doesn't care, but they do it
anyway?

But anyway, go back and look at my initial post. Never once did I say that
Larry shouldn't make such posts, or that they shouldn't be allowed, or that
they did not belong here, and so on. It was the same question repeated in a
number of different ways: Why would you think somebody will care about your
quitting? He can post it all he wants. I simply wanted to know why he would
desire to make such a post.

I do. Or did, more accurately. Jumped around between a few, but they were
all as you described and I pretty much abandoned looking to them as a source
of information.

Okay, makes sense. Like I said, almost all of my RTS playing has been
offline, either solo or over a LAN.

So there really *are* people that it matter to. I suppose I can understand
why, if you're the type to bop around from MMOG to MMOG.
