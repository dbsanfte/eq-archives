Big boy words?

Quoting myself(condensed newlines)

"Or, as you have chosen, there is Option C. Option C is having no point and 
the painfully blatant agenda of making yourself look like a fucktard.
 *cough*  Excuse me, Mr Teakettle?"

Which of these words is a "big boy word"? Assuming that you somehow 
consider three syllables(oh no, there I go again) to be a "big boy word", 
let's go down the list and find one:

painfully - I really hope this isn't the one
blatant - Two syllables, but maybe this is a "big boy word"
agenda - This was in response to you using it 
fucktard - Perhaps you meant "naughty word"? Well, if so, please replace my 
use of the word fucktard with some other more lowbrow synonym for "an 
expression of scorn and contempt".
teakettle - See painfully

...while you succeed admirably in your fucktard mastery(251).

And now, the troll admits its nature, and I banish it to the murky depths 
of my killfile.
