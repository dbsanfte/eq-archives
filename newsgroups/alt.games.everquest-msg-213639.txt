Haha, yes.  Good points.

Bards can:
DoT, Nuke (crappy), Charm, Mez, Heal (slowly), Haste (even break the haste
cap), Slow, Snare, regen mana, debuff, gate a mob to its spawn point, raise
faction, increase intelligence and wisdom, bind site, find corpses, drop
ourselves from the hate list, remove poisons, cure diseases, remove curses,
regen stamina, make it so you aren't hungry or thirsty, make your weapons
magical if they aren't already, increase a caster's nuking and DoT (new
LDoN song) damage, levitate, invis, breath underwater, decrease aggro range
(ala Lull), fear, oh and dual wield melee.  They are just about the fastest
levelling class, if you like soloing, via swarm and AE kiting.  Did I
mention that they can run slightly faster than the fastest horse in the
game?

Bards cannot:
Gate, port, summon, rez, pick the more important locks (CoM for example),
tap life, tank well past level 50 without uber armor, regen their own mana
(which they use for a few of the higher level songs).
