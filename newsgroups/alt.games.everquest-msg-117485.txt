At higher levels your best friends will be necro's and mages. I know I can
keep a cleric fm with Trods while we both nuke occasionally and do "our
things" (he heals, I ds / pet / debuff). In a frenzy group it's most
obvious; when the cleric starts meleeing / pulling and nobody has to sit
down at all.

This is for the 50+/55+ game though, necro's are more usfull below lvl 56
with their twich and self-crack.

Buying a horse also helps, but I doubt you'll have enough cash for that
anytime soon on FV.
