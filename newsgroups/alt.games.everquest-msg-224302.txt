Tons of hotkeys drive me nuts.  It's spam to me.  When I'm forced to hear
about every last dot, nuke, buff, debuff, pet buff, snare, tash, heal,
damage shield, mana drain, stun, assist (usually 5 times a fight), summon,
visage, pet assist and pet attack in the group, I can't see the important
stuff.  Like, "add."  Or, "afk."  Or, "add beating on me."  Or, "I think I'm
going LD, don't pull."

The essential casts that should (IMO) be hotkeyed:
 - Incoming/Pulling (tanks--not a casting thing, but important)
 - Single mezzing (first time you mez a mob only, once you do, it's all
yours)
 - AE mezzing (each time, so we know you might get yourself)
 - CH or other long heals (so we know the cleric/healer is out of commission
for many long seconds)
 - Snare (ONLY if runners or fears are an issue)
 - Roots
 - Charms

Optional:
 - Pacification/Harmony (depends on how well your group works)
 - Stuns, if it's a situation where the stunner is likely to get high agro
from it that they don't want.
 - Anytime you have two people sharing a job with overlap and don't want to
waste mana (ie, two Clerics).  But let 'em /t it to each other if it gets
spammy.

And NOTHING ELSE (special situations excluded).  Some people like to know
the mob is slowed, but I figure if you can't tell it's slowed, it ain't
gonna matter anyway.

I trust my groups to do their jobs.  If they're not, it'll quickly be
apparent.  They don't need to keep us all up to date on every last spell
they cast.
