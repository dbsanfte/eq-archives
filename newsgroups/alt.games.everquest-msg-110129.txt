Actually, bards can practice songs on boats.  And you can fish on boats, but 
you have to do it only when the boat is actually moving (not sitting on the 
zone line for reasons only to make the ride longer).  You can also forage
on the boat.  Not that that makes any sense :)

Some people have reported being able to actually beg from the boat... target
the boat and hit beg.  I haven't been able to get that to work.  It always says
I'm too far away.

But yeah, it's mostly a pure waste of time.
