Yup yup. CoV for example. The cross-server chat channel. Transferring 
characters from server to server. Implementation of an arena for PvP, the 
mysterious non-combat levelling system for example are things that they 
are working on.

Yup. In the 3 months or so I have been playing CoH, I have been bothered 
by someone KSing me once, so I want on a different mission in a different 
Zone, and been accused of KS'ing a couple of times. Once because I was 
teamed with fuckwits who decided to jump hydras others were engaged in in 
PP (I left that team right  then and there. I don't imagine they did 
laseted very much longer without my Emp defender the way they were 
playing). The other times by accident when one of my alts engages someone 
at a building corner when someone else on the other side had already 
started engaging them. I apologize, they said s'aright, and we each went 
our seperate ways.

All in all, it is way too minor an occurance for me to be overly worried 
about it.
