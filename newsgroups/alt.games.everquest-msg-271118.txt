Yes, but you're quitting because it was down for 27 hours.  And since
you say you only play for an hour a day anyway, you've lost out on 1
hour (or 2, if you regular playtime coincided with the start and end).

You go out to the car to drive to the store, and it's got a flat - you
get pissed off, but you don't decid to junk it.  You fix the tyre.  

Admittedly, there's nothing you can do but what in the case of a
MMORPG going down, but still...

I thought it was spelt like this everywhere - one more thing for the
US<->UK proofreaders to look out for.   :)

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
