Ok, I didn't know that was possible with plain text, that's good to know
(thereby avoid).  Now, let's see if you can answer this one (because it
really irkitates me).  Sometimes when I reply to a message, it doesn't put
in those nice indents.  What's up with that.  Note, it's only sometimes, so
I know I have my options set right (I hope).
