Hi... a week ago I started a new character.  A Barbarian Rogue.  Having a
high lvl Sammy and Wizzy I was able to equip the Rogue fairly well from the
start.  At lvl 32 his stats are; HP's=1384, AC=775, ATK=791

Question;  As Rogue now quickly moves into the higher end game (should be in
the low 50's within next 2 weeks) which stat should I focus on when
upgrading to Umber gear, Sta or Agi?  I've discovered that once one starts
playing in PoP HP's are kinda meaningless... since mobs hit for 300+/- a
wack 1000HP's are gone in 5 or 6 wacks... so since its kinda impractical to
think of any PC with nearly as many HP's as the PoP mobs, AC is the route
I'd like to take to lessen the number of hits incurred.  So I'd like to get
my AC as close to 1000 as possible, which if my thinking isn't flawed,
should reduce total damage taken.

Thanks for any constructive imput...

w...
