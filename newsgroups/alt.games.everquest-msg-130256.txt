Excerpt from:
Statement by the Arab League States
Following the Establishment of the
State of Israel
(May 15, 1948)

"Palestine was part of the former Ottoman Empire subject to its law and
represented in its parliament. The overwhelming majority of the population
of Palestine were Arabs. There was in it a small minority of Jews that
enjoyed the same rights and bore the same responsibilities as the (other)
inhabitants, and did not suffer any ill-treatment on account of its
religious beliefs."
--------------------------------------------
Even the Arab League admitted that THERE have always been Jews in the land
of Israel
