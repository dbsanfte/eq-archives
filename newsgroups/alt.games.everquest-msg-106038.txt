All the information in Allakhazam's is there whether you pay or not.
All paying does is offer you access to extended search options and a
few "cool" features. The subscription service was required to keep
theses sites afloat after so many sponsors wouldn't pay out.

Fuck no. If you want the premium services, pay the $3.33/month for it.
Skip buying a few Cokes for the month...

As I said above, all the information is still available at
Allakhazam's if you don't pay...
