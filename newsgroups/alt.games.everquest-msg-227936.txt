Control freak, seen it more then a few times myself. There are a number of
good reasons to start a guild, being a control freak is not one of them.

Looking to feed a real life personality disorder by manipulating people in a
fanatsy game just ain't a good idea. I've found the people that do it are
typically so out of control in their personal behavior that it becomes
obvious: In game rants, threats, shouts, raving, unreasonable demands.
Nervous breakdown waiting to happen.

When they lose control, they exercise their ultimate control by destroying
the guild.

Great! You are probably too healthy to do it and lucky not to have been
exposed directly to it.

Bingo, except I would say it more towards being desperate to control
something, anything, in their existance to give them some sense of power. It
is more seeking power then exercising it that causes the problems. You can
feed the monkey but he is always hungry.
