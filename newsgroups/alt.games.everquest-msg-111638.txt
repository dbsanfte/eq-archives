This weekend our Guildleader had his highest level alt's (52 Warrior)
surname taken away. Never figured out if it was somebody petitioning, or
that he finally just ran into a guide/GM who noticed and/or cared. He
asked about it later among the officers, and all I could tell him was I
was shocked it had taken 52 levels. His name wasn't offensive, or out of
the fantasy context, but it did violate the rules on stringing together
words to form a sentence. His warrior is an Ogre, and he'd orginally
chosen the surname name "Bashumgud". Sad, but inevitable I suppose.
