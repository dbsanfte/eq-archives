I play a necro and rarely have this problem. Sure it sometimes wears off,
but
if there are ably hostile mobs around just stay out of their range while
they
are around. Or use feign death instead of invis.

Well that's a problem with your system, not with the game. I don't get
disconnected
anything like that amount.


One good alternative is to swim out to the firepot room and bind there. You
can then
get almost anywhere in the world very quickly.
