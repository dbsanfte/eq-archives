First the European Fan Faire - for which money has been collected for
tickets (to be refunded) - is indefinitely postponed, no replacement date,
no reasons given.

Second, we're no longer allowed to know how many players are online.

Call me a cynic if you will, but I sense a common thread here. I was highly
amused to see on Lomthemad's page that in referring to the speculation over
the "reasons" behind the server status change the highlighted word "reasons"
links to DAoC's website LOL :)!
