Ah the news group pariah. Doesn't that con white to at 22nd? I think
they spawn in Kunark, I assure you.

Yes there is a face hankerchief, I assure you, but it has to take
advantage of the transmogrifying software functions from Direct X in
EQ. You should reinstall the drivers. First use a magnet to pull the
old driver from your hard drive, then reinstall.

The first is looking like your character, which means you HAVE to take
a hefty bag like the one you want and put it over your head. Use a
belt to tie it tight. Don't worry about seeing, the software will make
everything appear as a red wash, then you will see a bright white
light then you will see again. I assure you, it does, but I dont
remember where that is. Perhaps someone else can remember more
vaguely.

It also helps if you use standard (not correct) capitilization and
punctuation so we know what you want. If you are assured of the
answer, why are you asking?
