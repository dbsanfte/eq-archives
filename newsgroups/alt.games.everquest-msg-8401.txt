The people kiting also need to show some respect for
others.  I also play a druid, and i make a point of watching
for other players as well when I kite.  It is just common
courtesy if you ask me.  I am sure when you were younger and
probably fighting in oasis, you didn't like it when some one
kiting something let it "escape" by orc highway, or loosed
the spectres on the beach.  If everyone takes a small effort
to watch for their fellow players, it really doesn't become
an issue.
