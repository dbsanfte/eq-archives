Tailoring. 

Level 53 ranger who's spent 5 hours in the Crystal Caverns hunting
stackable velium for that sole reason. It sucks. I wish I could
hunt a decent cloak but as a half elf with a base wisdom of 65 a
tailored tigerraptor cloak will help out immensely.

Then I'm going to go smack fire giants about for a polished mithril
torque and possibly visit Droga for a idol of the thorned ;) But
my point is some trade skills still do produce nice player made
items... uh... actually, other than tailoring I cant think of that
many. hmm.

Damn. ;-)
