LvL will not be higher then 15, and you cannot loot, or Talk.
Attacking other NPC runes still apply, some people told me that got
there Rat to LvL 5, you can attack anything including players, kind of
fun to supprised a newbie. If it goes Live, it will only be on PvP
servers, your monster comes with the regular dropped loot and casters
will have a spell book with all there current LvL spells.

in some areas there are corps that have player decay times.

Hmm not sure why but your post was all 2 big giant ass lines which
went off my screen instead of the way I made it above.

Its live today on pvp servers, whenever the servers go up.

Oh okay, I was reading this post to see what the "SUPER AI" was, but
now I understand that you are meaning because players can play mobs.
