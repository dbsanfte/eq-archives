I knew I should have saved the name I wanted weeks ago, but really who would
think that anyone else would want the name Frigalinne.  It's a nickname my
husband uses for my daughter, that has evolved over the years, from when she
was first born and he called her Froggy.  It was because of the way a
newborns legs are pulled up against their bodies.  (he's kinda strange I
know) Anyway believe it or not every variation of Frigalinne I tried was
taken.

So who the hell would want to be called Frigalinne?
