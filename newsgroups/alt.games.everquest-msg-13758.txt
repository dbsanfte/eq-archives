You said I had admitted that turning off the message would solve the
problem.  I made no such admission.  I neither see uninvited inspecting as
"a problem", nor do I think turning off the message "solves" it.

I disagree.  Knowing who is disrespectful is not moot to me.  It is not as
though I want to hide from an insult by plugging my ears.  I want to know
who are the people who behave in such a way.

I keep a list of people to whom I do not give rezes, heals or buffs.
Similarly I do not group with these people.  There was a time when I did not
keep such a list, but I learned my lesson when I got into a bad group with a
person ... for the second time.  Since then I have kept two lists, a friend
list and an avoid list.  I have heard from many people that they keep
similar lists.

You are the one who called it a "problem".  I just indicated that I didn't
see any problem at all ... for me.  I don't see how it causes a problem for
others either.  That might be where the inventive comparison to Dahlmer and
McVeigh fails.  Did you really mean to say that the person who's request for
a rez has been declined is harmed in a way comparable to Dahlmer and
MacVeigh's victims?

Bizbee calls me petty.  Ouch, that hurts!

I guess I'll file that (along with the suggestion for medications) under
"more free medical advice from bizbee".  Thank you.

BTW, who is "foaming at the mouth" here?  This topic seems to get you very
worked up, bizbee.  My original post was to address a simple point:  some
people do take actions in the game regarding uninvited inspections.  Calling
it wrong, lame or petty does not make the point less valid.  Telling the
person making the point that they should get medication or visit an analyst
does not make it less valid.
