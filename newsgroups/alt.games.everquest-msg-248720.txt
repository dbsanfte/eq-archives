DAoC was more popular than any other MMOG had been in its first few
weeks of release. It was a great launch, with terrific initial sales.

Now? No, it's barely staying alive now.

That's the basic problem with MMOGs. People play for many reasons, but
ultimately, it's an investment in a new community and culture, and
unless your players evangelize for you and bring in new players, your
game is dead.

EQ has brought in new players by virtue of being the largest MMOG with
the most history. That keeps the players recruiting for you, but if
EQ2 and EQ fragment the market between them... WoW could likely have
the largest player base out of the gate. People who "want to be with
their friends" will go play WoW, and leave both EQ and EQ2. This is
not the future SOE should be lining up.

Now, if SOE were honest with their players, things might be different.
If they said, "EQ's code is unsupportable, so we're going to replace
it. Buy EQ2, and we'll move you over to the new game as best we can
and try to never have to do this again," I'd buy it in a heartbeat.
There would no longer be this sense of "leaving EQ". You'd transition
all of the players and after some period of months start offering
cheaper and cheaper transfer as you start to shut down the old EQ
servers. Certainly painful, but do it once and that's fine.

What SOE is doing instead is treating EQ like a video game, and
they're going to discover that it's not just that (again).
