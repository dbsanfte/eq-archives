I'll trade you a chess game I've been playing against an opponent I'd prefer
not to name for legal reasons.  I announced mate in 3 already.  You can get
the thrill of victory without actually having to play the fucking game.
Doesn't that sound satisfying?  If it is, please respond with server and
account.  To be fair, I'll do the same.  I'm black on an 8x8 board.  I fancy
myself to be a less deranged Bobby Fisher, you see.  Except I can't play my
way out of a wet paper bag.  Anyway, you can't miss me if you look in the
right places.  I look forward to hearing from you.

BTW, I love your real email addy in a Usenet post.  I only hope you can find
the emails of interested parties among the spam you're about to start
getting.  Sometimes I think the Internet really should require a license for
use . . .
