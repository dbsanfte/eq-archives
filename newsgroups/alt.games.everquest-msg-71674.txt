Mike Jittlov.  Best stop-motion animator ever.  See IMDB for more
information.

>>2. Time After Time

Basic plot: HG Wells really built the time machine.  One of his
friends turns out to be Jack the Ripper, and steals the time machine
and escapes to modern San Francisco.  Horrified that he has helped
unleash Jack on what must surely be Utopia, Wells pursues.

Well, duh!  I assumed it went without saying that I meant SW and TESB.
:-)

Interesting/frightening observation.  When Lucas made SW, he was still
a relatively ordinary guy for Hollywood.  He had not yet achieved a
position where he would have complete control over his movies.
Presumably, he had the studio looking over his shoulder, saying "no" a
lot.  With TESB, he was more of a big shot, but I suspect he still had
to put up with a lot of studio meddling.  With ROTJ, he was more
powerful, and presumably could more closely make the movie *he*
wanted.  With TPM, he was in a position where no one could say no to
him.

Yet, SW or TESB were the best of the movies so far, ROTJ was OK but
nowhere near as good as the first two...and the less said of TPM, the
better.

Could it be that Lucas' version of the SW story in fact sucks, and the
first two movies were great because of some nameless studio execs who
meddled?  I dread the next two movies.
