It happened again, and no keyboard commands worked.  Ctrl-S did
not sit.  F1 did not target myself.  Holding down Alt did do its
usual thing (displayed names next to spell gems, etc.)

Pressing and releasing Ctrl did not fix the problem.  I also tried
Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Caps Lock, and Num Lock.  Eventually I just camped
to clear the problem.
