Its a fun quest. Actually im not POV flagged, but got a friend to get me 
2 fish from there. But the fishing pole are nice, no need to worry about 
breaking poles any more (still break at 200 skill, actually break rate 
for me got around 100% times worse, broke 12 poles total, 8 of them in 2 
hours after i got 200 skill), and the beer are REALLY nice for fun and 
guild events.
