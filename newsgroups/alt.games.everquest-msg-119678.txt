Bandages.  Seriously.  They're faster than even my Skyshrine quest
Breastplate, the only other way my warrior has to heal himself.

Verant intentionally has made it so that healing is not available from items,
except in *extremely* limited doses.  They do not want melee classes to be
able to solo, and this is one of the ways that they "strongly encourage"
grouping.

The invis potions are another story altogether.    I've started carrying one
for emergencies as standard operating procedure.
