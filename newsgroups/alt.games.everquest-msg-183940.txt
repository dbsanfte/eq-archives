Once you hit 61, they throw in some tremendous penalties for fighting lower
con monsters.   If you're hunting in the new "planar" zones, then the zones
themselves make up for it with a huge exp bonus that is nearly insane.    If
you cannot fight in the planes regularly, you should not ding 61.   It will
kill the rate of AA gain tremendously, fighting the same stuff you were at
60.

The original poster said that his computer needed upgrading before he could
play in the PoP zones regularly.

If he can play in the PoP zones, it's fine to be 61.  He won't really notice
the difference between hunting there at 61, or old world at 60.
