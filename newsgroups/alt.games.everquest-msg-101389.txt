It's not the crack part I have a problem with, it's the "plz."  I will not
buff or port anyone who uses "plz" unless they're paying me or I have
another good reason for doing it (usually if they're in my group or guild).
Call me anal, but I can't stand that abbreviation.  Even pls is better than
plz; where in the word please is the letter z?  If you're so lazy you can't
type 3 extra characters, at least you can try to get the characters you do
type right :P
