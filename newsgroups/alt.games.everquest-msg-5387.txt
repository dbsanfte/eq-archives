Well good news and bad news.  The guy you turn the bone chips doesn't
turn to face you.... very often.  No idea what makes  him do it, but
I've seen him turn towards me a few times.  Luckily the Trooper faction
goes up fast, if you've been killing goblins and outcast iksar you may
already be dubious with them.  Its the Crusaders who parade right by you
have to be careful of, but if you wedge yourself in behind the NPC you
are giving the chips to you seem to be out of the Crusader's agro range
as they go past, I've never been attacked there anyway.  If you've
already been, hope it went well, if you are still going, good luck!!
