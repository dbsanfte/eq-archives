While there are still invisible impassable walls on some mountains, it 
is possible to run from the east coast to the west coast in a straight 
shot.  A very LONG straight shot.  EQOA's world is HUGE!

The zones I think are squares on a grid but ... you aren't really aware 
of zone lines, sure the topography may change some but it's hard to tell 
what zone you are in at any one time.  A grid that us beta testers came 
up with helps figure out if certain zones are north of you or south of 
you.  In beta, we had a readout of the zone number and they were 
numbered by where on the master grid they were.  0203 would be the 2nd 
row and the 3rd zone from the west.

Hard to explain power.  It's kind of like EQ's mana.  You need mana to 
cast a spell in EQ.  In EQOA, all skills use 'mana' too.  Kick uses 
power, punches use power, you have to 'cast' skills and you can only 
have 5 of them up at a time.  Spellcasters use power too.  Found out 
there is clarity in the game when I grouped with a chanter, was nice not 
to run out of power in the middle for a while there.

Don't lose xp on death, you have a death debt after level umm 7 i think. 
   Costs more xp to get each level and if you die multiple times, your 
debt mounts up.  If you have a debt, half of your xp goes to debt and 
half to your level.  Say you kill a critter and get 15000xp.  But you 
have 23000 debt.  7500 will go to the debt to help pay it off and the 
rest goes on your level.  Unless you are steady xp grouping, your xp bar 
creeps along.  Except when you complete a quest, wowsa you get alot of 
xp for them sometimes.

Most have a keyboard, found out in beta it's just a PITA to use the 
onscreen keyboard.  I do have someone in my guild who doesn't have a 
keyboard.  With short phrases, he's quick, he's got that keyboard 
memorized and zips along at chatting.  Longer things he'll have to stand 
there looking stupid for a minute.
I saw a keyboard for sale online that had the controller built in, it 
was a full size keyboard too, I want it, may buy it if I can scrape the 
cash together.
I like the mail feature.  If you have something longish to say to 
someone you can send them mail instead.

There is random grouping but you gotta watch out for that.  Sometimes 
you get people who don't get the concept of sharing loot and alpha loot. 
    Everyone needs a share of the pie in EQOA, our weapons and armor 
degrade and we have to repair them.  Man that level 17 quested armor has 
nice stats but costs a fortune to upkeep.
Most of the time I group with guildies, one of which is my RL niece, I 
got her hooked on evercrack when she was living near me. She moved and 
now can't afford a computer to play EQ but she had a PS2 so she got 
EQOA.  One major difference in grouping: 4 person limit.  So hard 
sometimes to keep up heals without getting agro.

Depends entirely on who wrote the quest up.  Sometimes you get clear 
directions on where to go, you are told who to kill, what zone and what 
landmark to find him at.  Sometimes you get "kill soandso" with no clue 
whatsoever which direction that soandso is in.  It's annoying but if 
other players have done the quest you can usually get help on where to 
look at least.
