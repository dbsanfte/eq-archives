That is a good observation, as a root parking cleric I'd aggro mob, move 
him away, let him beat on me if needed while sticking root, then move 
away.  Melee would have to deliberately go after the thing in order to 
keep letting it beat on them.

Naturally, since they saw "mob beating on cleric, emergency emergency" 
they'd do just that.

Still, its also usually workable to root one of a pair and have the 
melee back up and kill whatever follows them, often -more- workable in 
tight quarters.  First engage takes place out in front of the kill spot 
proper, root one, back up into your real kill zone, no worries. 
Indoors, there's often nowhere to go with the add that isn't in aggro 
range of something, or in melee range of your support staff.  Even in 
LDoN, if you've been using pacify to bypass mobs, this can become a problem.
