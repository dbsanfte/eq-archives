I don't know what level you are or how much cash you have
but I assume since you said you just started that you are not
a twink and don't have much cash.

You said you are major KoS everywhere I assume you are
an Iksar monk then. All I have to say is why did you leave home?
Kunark is awesome and you can level to 60 without ever leaving
it, and Cabilis is right in the center of it all. If you want different
hunting grounds head to the moon, no one is KoS in the Bazaar
and Shadow Haven.

Don't carry backpacks the slot to weight ratio is horrible.
Use Large bags(1.0 weight 6 slot) for the big stuff and carry purses(0.2 weight 4slot)
for looting little stuff like words/runes/pages and gems, also good for
the bandages.
Try and get a tailor to make you the tailored large bags which weigh less
than the store bought ones and have 10% weight reduction on them.

Don't carry all your weapons on you. Just the one you are currently
working on, leave the others in the bank. You need to return to sell
and bank constantly as a monk so its not a big deal.

When you get to level 30-35 head to Crystal Caverns. Its an awesome
zone for a monk since there is a vendor and a bank right in the zone.
You will have to use the sneak skill to buy/sell from the vendors.

Save up and get a Rallic Pack ASAP. Then save up and get a tinkers
bag. Best 5k I ever spent on my monk.
