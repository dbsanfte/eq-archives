How were you on ramp if you were taking out the TG's? Just a busted
play with people dying? You should have been one of the last people to
get ramp unless you set yourself on it early. And in such a
situation.. usually saying I AM ON RAMP gets heals sent your way.
Also, you might check your discs for one similar to the warrior disc
Fortitude. Just check the timers.. if you have it, it'll be on the
same timer as Reckless.. just different name. Its the one for
deflecting all melee attacks.

Reckless or auto-riposte isn't an offensive disc.. its a defensive
one, and on a different timer as a result. All your offensive discs
should be on the same timer. The only times Reckless or auto-rip is
typically used is on a transition.. or if the tank were to die and mob
turned to you. You could hit the auto-rip disc while a tank pulled him
off if one is available and live through the experience.

At the time you'll be disc'ing offensive.. usually called by the raid
leader at a certain percent of mob health.. like 50% or lower.. the
only two things that should be able to pull Vindi off the tank are
death and god. Offensive discs.. if done while they are called..
should have no pulling effect.

Hahaha.. ya.. I wish. First... if you're getting damaged and not
MT/RT, something is going horribly wrong. Second.. if you ARE damaged
to the point where you do go into berzerker frenzy, the pesky druid in
group always goes nuts and pops you a heal. Third... while not as
dangerous in velious.. having hp below berzerker in PoP or beyond gets
very close to low hp agro, which can turn a mob in a heartbeat.

Personally.. couldn't tell you what offensive discs are better for
Berzerker... better you just parse it after a couple of different
tests and find out. Any trash xp mob should work as the results should
scale.
