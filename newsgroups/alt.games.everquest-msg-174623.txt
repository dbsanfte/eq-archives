Or beastlords for that matter.  Or rangers.

In fact I can't think of any reason to put rogue in that "must
have" slot.

How about

Sponge
Cleric
Enchanter or Shaman
DPS
DPS
candidate.

If possible, include at least one beastlord, unless you have
access to SP outside the group.  If possible, include at least
one mage, unless you have access to DS and mod rods outside the
group.  If possible, include at least one shaman unless you have
access to shaman buffs outside the group.

Enchanter and shaman make for two radically different fights;
Enchanter uses traditional mez and slow techniques, shaman uses
AE slow, in which case you really really want that cast DS.. and
a bard "candidate" would be nice.

As you can see, bringing a small horde of people, instead of just
the 5 ringers plus a candidate, helps, since you can recieve
outside buffs before going in.

Banish.. I'm convinced this is usually a mistake.  Rocks are the
easiest kills, your group should be able to take them out without
so much as a nuke from the caster (mage or druid), so the only
reason to banish is if you are using the mez strategy and you
draw multiple rocks in a wave.  Some have reported that banishing
doesn't reset the clock, so you can't even use it as an "omg we
are killing this one too slow" plan.

Since you are bringing in ringers, make that cleric a high level
one with decent FT and all the mana regen you can stack on him,
and he can help out to the tune of 1100 damage per mob, and still
get to final mob at over 60% mana  (this also assumes high level
tank and competant slower), I've found this to be the difference
between make and break; I hang back and conserve mana and we tend
to fail, I nuke all non rocks and we get to final mob.  If 60%
mana isn't enough to do final mob, then your group doesn't have
enough ringers!
