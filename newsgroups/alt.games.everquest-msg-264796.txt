I'm not sure they will merge servers, at least in a player-visible way.  An
EQ server is a cluster of several machines, with each machine in the cluster
handling serveral zones.  Rather than merge player-visible servers, I think
they will adapt the software so that one server cluster can serve more than
one player-visible server.  They could have problably fairly easily built in
support for this when they made the changes to support instanced zones for
LDON.

Then, they might merge servers internally, but there is no need for the
players to see that.  If they do the architecture properly, the load on a
given cluster would pretty much only depend on the total number of players
served by that cluster, not how many player-visible servers there are.

If they do that, instead of eliminating servers as the population declines,
they can then just disable new character creation on some servers, and offer
free or cheap moves to people to move off that server, so as to try to keep
the populations up on other servers.  (Or do like DAoC does to balance
server populations, and offer leveling bonuses on some servers).

The above would be better on Sony's end than a real server merge, because it
avoids the mass name conflict problem.  Sure, when people take advantage of
an incentive to move to another server, there will be name conflicts, but a
name conflict and change when you voluntarily decide to take advantage of an
incentive offer is a lot easier to swallow than one as the result of a
forced move.
