And here I thought I was the only one who did that.  I am happy to say it
has been around 10 levels now since I last pulled that stunt.  At the time,
I rooted myself right next to a pair of Drolvarg Ragers in DL.  I was quite
amazed at just how fast they pounded my sorry ass into the ground.  I did
not, and still generally do not, have gate memorized at the time.
