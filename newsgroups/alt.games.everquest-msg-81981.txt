No, a fetus -is- a human being, at the fetal stage of development.  There is
no reason to say "potential," except to try to obscure the issue.

No, those cells are not potentially a human being.  They are part of a
person, and as such should be kept when useful (ie the liver cells), and
discarded when no longer useful, or even harmful (fecal matter).  There is
no potential to become a human being.

I'm not worried about hypothetical "potential" people.  I'm worried about
the rights of real people, including those in the fetal stage of
development.

Which, again, obscures the point.  The fetus is a unique person, with her
own genetic code.  If nature is allowed to take course, she will become a
child, and then an adult.  All stages of human development.

Maybe you haven't been paying attention to the stem cell debate (no suprise
there).  The argument against fetal stem cell research is that it destroys a
human life to extract them.  This is even worse, given the fact that adult
stem cells have shown themselves to be better adapted to thereputic roles,
and don't require killing children.

Again, it's not the issue of potential humans, it's the issue of real
humans, including those at the fetal stage.

> And, of course, even if the fetus *is* a human being, it has no greater

No, but the rights being violated are more fundamental.  The mother's rights
come down to the issue of her control over her reproductive rights.  That's
a very high level right.  The child's right that's being violated is the
right to her own life.  That's the most fundamental right, and trumps the
mother's freedom of choice.

Far less than the danger of a successful abortion, and much better than the
dangers of a (not uncommon) botched abortion.  Of course, that's ignoring
the fact that abortions are 100% lethal to the child.

Not even close.  Vagrants can get a job, they can go to a shelter, hell,
they can even survive on the street.  A fetus cannot survive outside the
mother.  I did not cause the vagrant to come about.  The mother caused the
child to come about.

I believe the word that describes this line of unreasoning is "sophistry."

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
