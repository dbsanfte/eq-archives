I doubt it.  Sean Woolley was an extreme case.  Most people have more
going on in their lives than simply EQ, even if they are the 18/7
players that lots of people deride.

I've heard of one who was a college student, who was flunking out, and
had to assess his life prospects knowing that he was not going to be
getting a college degree.  There was a lot that was going badly in his
life (college being the worst of them, but perhaps other things like
failed relationships etc.), and rather than taking the tough road, he
ended it.  There are a lot of circumstances that point in total to the
suicide, and EQ's link to causation would be far too tenuous for even
the most foolish attorney to try to make a case of it.

At the end of his life, Woolley had very little going on besides EQ,
and it's still too tenuous to build a case around.
