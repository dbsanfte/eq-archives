	It takes you more than one minute to find the mobs and round them up, so
basically you're talking out of your ass.

|Can your ranger beat that...i dont think so...

	When you add in all the time you have to spend begging for SoWs (got it),
Clarity (don't need it), looking for targets (I push a button), running around
buying food (I push a button), and looking for your corpse because something
went wrong (I can take a hit and get out of Dodge)...sure.

	You need to get out more, then.

|And by saying you do, you are also saying you solo better than a

	Quite frankly, I don't think much of your "facts".
