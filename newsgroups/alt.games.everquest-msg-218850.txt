Yes, they changed the way pets taking xp from you works.  Summoned pets 
take basically no xp if you do any damage at all to the mob.  Charmed 
pets take xp based on the amount of damage they did to the mob.  For a 
bard swarm kiting, should not be a major issue, as it's not the charmed 
pet doing most of the damage, but rather the hoard hitting the charmed 
pet.
