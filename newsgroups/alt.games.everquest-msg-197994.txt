Don't make that assumption.  Instead, check with a Monk over level 30
and find out how much his HP changes with STA (either swapping gear
or adding buffs).  The computation of HP changes as you level up, I
am not certain of all of the breakpoints but I'm pretty sure the
same formula applies from 31 (possibly 25, 26, or 30) thru 60.  For
Warriors it is (level / 10 * (delta STA)).  For knights (PAL/SK) it
is (level / 13 * (delta STA)).  I think that priests (CLR/SHM/DRU)
get ((level / 20 * (delta STA)).  Don't know numbers for any other
classes, but Rangers, Rogues, Monks, and Bards are likely somewhere
between the knights and the priests.

Warning:  Don't generalize anything (except maybe mana pool) from
characters under L10, and be suspicious of any generalization based
on characters under L30 or so.
