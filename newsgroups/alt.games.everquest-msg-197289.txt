I agree.  Cirocco can raise her defense skill and that will help with the
AC, but I'm not sure she'll really notice much difference when a blue con
mob starts meleeing her.  It's still going to get very ugly very fast.
Avoidance is an absolute must and at a premium.  The mobs are only going to
hit even harder relative to her hitpoints as she gets higher in level.
