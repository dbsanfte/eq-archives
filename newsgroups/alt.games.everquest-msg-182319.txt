  Seems like every low level in the world is running around with level 50 buffs
on anymore.  I just started a druid and I've never felt more useless in a
group.  I can't hit anything the super buffed warriors i'm fighting with can
hit and my weak little heals don't even make a scratch in their health bar. I
guess I'll just keep on riding peoples coat tails and mooch exp off them but
sooner or later they're gonna realize that I"m useless to their group.
