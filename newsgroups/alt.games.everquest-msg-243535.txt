First off don't get a 9200 just because it has a woping 256mb of ram.  You
will be diapointed.  There are some excelent cards out right now for the
$120 - $180 range. The Radeon 9600 XT 128 version will blow the 9200-256
away. While it will cost you twice (149 / 74 ) the money, it is worth it.
Also if you have a slite bit more (177 is the cheapest) to spend get an FX
5900 XT. this is the hot card right now Price / performance wise.  you can
get it cheaper than a 9800pro, and it beats it in every test ( by a good
bit )

Next to try to fix the problem you are having, try this.

1 download the latest WHQL (non beta) drivers for your vidio card.
2 download the latest chipset drivers for your motherboard
3 Down load Driver Cleaner ( www.driverheaven.net/cleaner/ )
4 Disconect the computer from the net. ( when you remove grafics drivers
windows goes out to get new ones without your consent.  unpluging from the
net forces compatability drivers to be used)
5 Go to Add/Remove programs and remove ALL vidio related drivers. ( the
Vidio driver, the Shell it instals for you sys tray if it is seperate)
6 Restart the computer.
7 Load into Safemode ( F8 after hitting restart and hold it till you boot
in)
8 Run cleaner.
9 Restart your computer
10 Install your new CHIPSET drivers.
11 Restart computer
12 Install new Vidio driver.
13 Reconect to the net ( if you are brodband)
14 restart computer
15 Deleat EQGraphicsDX9.dll in the Eq Directory - it will be repatched when
you sign on to EQ next time.
16 Hit start => run and type DXDIAG in the box
17 click on the DISPLAY tab and run both tests.
18 run eq and hit options and do a compleate file check.

If after all that youare still having problems, you might want to turn down
some of the graphic options.

Just replacing the graphics card might not help if your computer is on the
old side. I tried to run eq on a p3 1000 with 384 megs of ram and a 9600 Xt
at 1600 x1200. NO GO, had to drop it down to 1024 x 768 to get playable
framerates and that was with all the graphic options turned off.  I know the
limiting factor in this setup is the 1g processor, and it will be fixed
soon.  For now it will work for my second box.
