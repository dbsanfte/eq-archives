I was going to say :)

62 water pet runs 70dps on average against pop mobs (pure melee,
a bit more when you include it's spell (slashed by shards of ice)
and procs from a summoned weap (IE Sword of Walnan))

Top end mages are showing 150+dps sustained.  Those with Suspend
Minion 2, and all the good pet canni skills.

Basically they /pet kill and nuke as much as aggro management
allows - at end of fight, they suspend the pet, and pet canni
to full - then recall pet for next fight.

These guys have LOTS of aa though - they are in the range of
Meemers - 65 + well over 100 aa.

This is from parses on the Magicians Tower.  Someone there
(Yanbun?) was collecting parses, he had BL and Mage parses
that I know of, might be worth it for Ben to look at.
