None that I'm aware of, but that is irrelevant.

Exactly, and the decidedly un-fun tactics of real war have no place in what
is supposed to be a fun game.

A newbie in paintball can beat (and will beat, and has beaten) the best
player in the world. Further, the newbie has the choice about who he plays
with, and if he doesn't want the Ultimate Paintball Death Squad opposing
him, he has that option. The only way a level 1 will beat a level 50 in
DAoC is if the level 50 goes AFK for several hours...and even then it isn't
likely. You have no choice about who you PvP with in DAoC...you just have
to hope that you can beat whoever you happen across.

You seem to have some confusion here...I'll clear it up:

A rule is something which is imposed on the reality of what you can or
cannot do.

A fact simply exists.

Safe area safe, frontier isn't is not a rule, is a fact. Not a rule.
Shooting yourself in the head with an unloaded weapon is safe, shooting
yourself in the head with a loaded one isn't...is also a fact. Also not a
rule.

Not being able to kill realm mates...THAT is a rule.

The only rule I stated for war is: Be the last one standing. Has nothing to
do with realm travel. PS: DAoC is not a wargame, it's an RPG...says so
right on the box.

Go burn your strawman, it just doesn't work here.
