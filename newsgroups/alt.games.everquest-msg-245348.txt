Try www.eqdruids.com  they have a couple of guides on quad kiting in
their information library (one is called the unabridged guide to
quadkiting).



How I do quadkiting (even though I don't always go for four).

When my druid reached 34 and got Lightning Strike, I was rooting and
rotting the gnolls at the Split Paw spires. Being very cautious and
with a wide open space to work in, I followed a suggestion I read
about making sure that you can kill a single target with your
Lightning Strike. Nothing like having four mobs snared after you and
find that you don't have enough mana to finish the job. :)

I did a lot of single kiting until I got used to the procedure since I
could switch to root and rot if I mucked it up. Then went to twos and
later to threes. Some threes turned into fours when a gnoll suddenly
spawned as a snared one ran past it.

Always have at least SoW up. If you don't remember when you last cast
it, refresh it and mem back the mana. I adjust the two fixed angle
camera views so that I can still see myself and as much of the
surrounding area as possible.

1. Pick a gnoll, snare it -- using the ensnare spell, it lasts a long
time -- and run toward the next gnoll. Snare it and go to the next
one, etc. I am often in first person or third person (from behind me)
view.

2. Walk backwards, adjusting left or right to get the pursuing gnolls
to converge on me. When they get pretty close together, I start
running in circles around them and switch to my fixed views so I can
see everything. Get them nice and tight.

3. Open some distance, Lightning Strike w/o spell haste takes 4.5
seconds to cast, and hit the spell gem or hotkey until it starts to
cast. I kind of prefer to be out of range to get the maximum amount of
time to cast the spell and I have an Extended Range II focus
(moonstone ring). I use a hotkey for LS since I don't have to fiddle
with the ALT key to cast in case of a fizzle.

4. Watch the countdown and, when the spell goes off, start running
again. If low on mana, you can run out of range and sit to med before
getting up and opening the distance again. Repeat from step 3 until
they fall down.

5. It may be that one or more might still be standing but they will
generally be in flight mode but standing still due to the snare. Melee
them down. At this point, I have used about 80 percent of my mana (WIS
143 or 153 with stat foods).

Spell lineup: Ensnare, root, Lightning Strike, SoW at a minimum. If
you do it right, you don't get hit. If you have to you can root the
mobs and run out of aggro range. Everything else is your preference,
possibly DoTs since they all stacks if they are damage only plus one
DoT that damages and debuffs.

I haven't done casters since they can hit you with spells and when
they stop to cast they get left behind and are out of the AoE of the
Lightning Strike.

I use my Track to see what might be nearby though druid track cannot
be sorted by range.
