Take time to read another article, one that was recently put out in London
about another fun lawsuit put out against McDonalds accordingly, which had
its verdict bonked down to a lower figure, where the Judge states that
McDonalds could also reasonably assume that said people should NOW be fully
aware of the fact that the contents of said liquid in a container,
especially given the fact it was requested hot, was going to be hot.  A
large number of the people cited in the lawsuit being younger children.
Furthermore, I did read the case, and yes, it did state that the coffee was
brewed at a temperature higher than the industry standard.  However, the
case for the old lady was also her SPILLING IT WHILE IN THE CAR, where
quite a few accidents occur from stupidity of the driver, one of which,
includes eatting while driving.

Inside the cover flap...  And this prevents them from opening it to read
the box in the first place?  Sorry, that excuse still doesn't fly.  The
cover flap itself is NOT taped down, nor is any software selling company is
going to pitch a fit at you lifting that cover flap to further entice you
into purchasing the product.  The whole concept of reading the box, besides
being tempted or enticed into purchasing a product, is also to get a better
idea of what is involved.  So, we should now put on another thing that
parents obviously don't look at or read, give them further fuel to become
mindless sheep?  No thank you.
