Oh good god since when did SOE become bloody Congress of the USA....this
has to be one of the most abused and misquoted Ive ever seen on Usenet and
thats quite a task.

You are perfectly welcome to sound off on Usenet, or anywhere in public
and the Government will not interfere, heck you can even appeal to the
law courts to see if you have a grievance - of course people WILL stop you
if you breach other peoples freedoms (ie their right of ownership to
something, their right to impose restrictions on entry to things they own
etc). You will however likely lose - you entered into an agreement with a
private body to go somewhere private and owned by them under certain
restrictions.

Well a) this isnt the government doing diddly to you, so frankly SOE can
do just that read your contract and stick with its limits or challenge it
in court (you know that redress by petitioning the governement you say you
are being denied)  and b) as yet I havent seen anything from you
to indicate you are qualified to express a judgment on their competence.
