Role play means to play a role in a specific milieu. Tell me again, who was
the haberdasher or weaponsmith in the Star Wars milieu? Trade skils simply
don't fit into the character of a Star Wars hero. If you want to imerse
someone in the Star Wars world, you need to consider what was important to
the characters in the SW films and build a new game accordingly. However if
you're just out to take Everquest and change the swords to lightsabers and
the spells to blasters it would fit just fine.
