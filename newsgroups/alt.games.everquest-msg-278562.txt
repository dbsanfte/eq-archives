Not really.  "Overhead" largely remains constant.  If one spends
45m of an hour actually fighting mobs (and the rest LFG, AFK,
whatever) they'll still get more XP in those 45m than they would
otherwise.

Not everything has to be min/max'd, of course.

Or one could say people running a split are the ones who don't
really understand the game and don't know how to play the game
effectively.  Since they don't really understand the game, they're
more likely to be in the safe places, backs to the zone lines, etc.

The "dangerous" encounters in the game aren't being done by
the "laid-back" players, right?
