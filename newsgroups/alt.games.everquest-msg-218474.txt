The scary part is, you people are not taking into consideration that a few
years ago the very same thing happened in another state, someone was elected
who was famous, he was elected based on his fame and the sad part is, his
state is doing fairly well. No he is not perfect but the govoner of
Minnisotta is doing fairly well.
I am of the mind that I will wait and see, if Arnold does well great, if he
doesnt then there is always next election.
Am I a Repulican? Am I a Democrate? I am niether, I vote based on my own
intelligence, if the person running wants to do 90 percent of what I want
then he is worth giving a shot too, if not then he can go in the round
filing basket.
All in all this is just my two cents, take it or leave it.
