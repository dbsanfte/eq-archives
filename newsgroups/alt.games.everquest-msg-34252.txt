Good thing with rogues and hide/sneak it doesen't drop at the worst
time possible, when i brought my lvl 4 chanter to thurgadin his invis
started dropping all the time at the wrong places, or almost instantly
:( the superior camo or what the fixed time on must be great.
Glad the coastline on EW has some places that you can use to drop out
of sight :)
