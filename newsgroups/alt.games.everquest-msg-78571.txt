Although I'd certainly agree with you before Velious came out, I can no
longer.  The shawl quest requires a hell of a lot of mastery and after 2
years (about when SoV came out) they surely knew that people weren't
mastering every trade skill, especially the useless ones like brewing,
pottery or (at the time) baking.

They must have changed their mind and decided that it's ok to master
something in a day.  If they put a timer on like DAOC they could at least
set a minimum time between attempts.  I think it's a logical next step for
Verant's apparently edited vision of trade skills.
