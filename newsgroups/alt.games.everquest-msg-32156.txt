The point of contention was if the rule set was designed for and I quote
"fair play".

In VI's own words, their list of exploits are examples vs exhaustive. VI
readily admits that there are bugs and exploits as yet to be discovered. I
think a direct if not close quote from them is "If you think it might be an
exploit, it is." The server *is* designed to be as fair as it can be under
the circumstances which is open PvP for level 6+.

Point of order, the rule set on the PvP servers like RZ<we are talking RZ>
is not a subset but a superset of rules applied on top of existing rules.
You still get banned for training, exploiting, cheating, harassment, have
stupid names changed, everything like a normal server with the added bonus
of being banned for things like bind point camping.

The only rule that does not apply is "consentual only combat" which is kind
of obvious. That would be "rule" vs "rules" as you posted. The confusion is
obviously yours.

I don't question that he is good at what he does, I just say it isn't PvP so
much as hunting cripples and cheapshots. If he wanted to post "I am the best
cheapshot artist in the game" I probably wouldn't contest it. I haven't seen
his name come up as a winner in the Best of the Best competition yet anyway.
Those would be the ones having a valid claim to knowing what PvP is about.
