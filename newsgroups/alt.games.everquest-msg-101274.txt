I never ported someone anywhere without them being aware of what I would
do.  I ask things upfront, cause I have been burned by people who just
disband and run off, and I always make sure someone gets into the zone
before I run off somewhere.  I always tell people I can take them somewhere
or somewhere close to their destination, so they know what it takes.  And
this is while I am anon, but being a wood elf, it is pretty damn obvious I
am no wizard, especially when the only non-druid like armor you can tell on
me is the Runed Mith Bracers and the Golden Effrett Boots, the rest is
leather armor.

If I really wanted to shaft someone, I could use my cleric, the High Elf
wearing the Crystal Covered Shroud and pretend I was a wizard then use the
gate spell, then log.  But I don't.  The druid in question screwed up in
one of the most common practices, probably because he was new to the whole
porting thing, or absent minded, cause most of the people I have dealt with
pretty much do the same as well.
