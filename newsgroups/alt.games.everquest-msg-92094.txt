I fell off the boat once with my 13th lvl Shaman and swam around for about 2
hours until I found and Island. If your stam hits 0 nothing bad will happen.
I would swim to the fire pot room and use that to port to a city. Be sure
that you have enough HP for the fall will cause about 100 to 150 hp in
damage. The only other suggesting is to shout of a port out of the Deep from
another player. I do not think a GM or Guide is gonna help you as you are
not in imediate damger and there are a few ways for you to get yourself out.
I may be wrong though. Go to www.eqatlas.com to find a map with the location
of the fire pot room.
