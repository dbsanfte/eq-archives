Good idea! I did that a while ago and never regretted it. You can really
help your guild with that after a while.

KOS to Ratmen, all the undead that roam about, and Master Yael himself.
(He doesn't seem to like anyone.)

There are ratmen randomly roaming in the tunnels and in the city past
the Jail door. I always sneak once I get past the Jail all the way to
the pool room before Yael's chamber. If Yael's not up, you're ok from
there. Nortlav won't aggro on you.

As pointed out, a SoW is about the only way to speed up the process.
