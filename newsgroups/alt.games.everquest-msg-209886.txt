You could probably do everything up to the Dire wolf solo at 33 if you
don't mind the possibility of dying once or twice doing the trial of
patience if  a shark shows up that can see invis. Otherwise, a group
in their high 30s should be able to handle the test. 

I'd guess that pretty much any class could solo Black Dire at 60+ (or
duo at 50+), so if you have any higher level friends it's worth it to
solo the first parts and kill him as soon as possible for the boots.
