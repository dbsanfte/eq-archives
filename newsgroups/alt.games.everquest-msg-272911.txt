I've heard that you can buy craft tables (like a forge, loom, desk, etc.) 
and put them in your room.  Does this mean that you could sell and craft at 
the same time?

Oh...one more thing. I know you can browse the merchant boards while you 
sell, but it looks like you cant buy anything?  This is probably by design 
since I had this great idea of buying anything I was selling that was priced 
lower than my price, then re-selling it at my higher price.
