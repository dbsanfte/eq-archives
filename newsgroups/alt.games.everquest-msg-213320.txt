And they happen to be 2 of the 3 toughest dragons in all of nToV.   Don't be
too shocked by those numbers - the rest is (for the most part) significantly
weaker

BS.  The droppable gear nowadays is vastly superior to the gear guilds wore
when first venturing into ToV
NAKED 60 BARDS have tanked nToV dragons (bored uber guilds back in the day)

Of course they have.
You know, there was a time when level 60 was the maximum for everybody to
be, with zero AA's, and ntov was cleared on a regular basis.

As somebody already pointed out though, ae damage and heals is more critical
than tanking, in ToV.
