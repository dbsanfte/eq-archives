More followup. It appears that you have to collect unrefined ore from
drops by goblins in one of several places. Permafrost is one, Runneye
and Solusek A are others. I may have to make an expedition to see if
that is what I needed to do. This makes sense but it is unfortunate
for the gnolls in Blackburrow are comparatively more accessible.
