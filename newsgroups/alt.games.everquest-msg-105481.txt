The evidence just does not support this . I have a 60 enchanter , a 60 druid
and a 55 monk. By FAR the hardest to level up was the druid. I never play
him either. While he was my first character and what I would play at least
part of the time if he was balanced , at this time there is never any reason
to do so.

Druids should be 75% a wizard and 75% a cleric. Atm they are about 66% a
wizard and 10% a cleric falling far short of where they need to be. Everyone
despises druids because they are sorta easy from 15-29. I hate to tell ya
but that level range comprises about .0000001% of the actual game. I would
even go so far as to say that they are the absolute hardest to level up now
that the semi`s have been fixed.
