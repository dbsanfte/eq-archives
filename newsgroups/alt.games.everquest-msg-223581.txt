I, at least am quite aware of whats involved, but its a continuum. 
Nobody is expecting NASA here... but SoE should be able to consistently 
deliver much higher results than they are, given the nature of so many 
of the bugs.

Hell... they have a TEST server... bugs that are identified on test 
should *not* show up on live servers. features (and the bugs that go 
with them) should not show up on live servers until they have been 
*validated* on test first.

Yup.

However:

The majority of the bugs have nothing to do with the hardware layer. 
Broken quests, broken items, broken spawns, broken loot tables, broken 
spell stacking/effects, broken mob abilities, broken AA abilities, 
broken haste, broken pets ... the list goes ever on.

There is definate room for improvement.... if this was a bathroom :) 
we'd just like to get up to 'McDonalds restaurant'; we're not asking for 
'Ritz Hotel'. While what we have is 'fair-ground outhouse'.

Yup.
