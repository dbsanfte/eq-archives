So don't cry.  Keep your mouth shut and let other people mourn in peace.

And yet, that's not the point!

No.  Are the emotions of everyone else in this highly public place so 
unimportant to you that you're okay with spouting off whatever springs 
to mind?  "Oh, COOL!" isn't exactly the most politic thing to say a few 
hours after the news hits.

Funny, I just asked my mom this morning if this was making a lot of 
young children rethink the whole "I want to be an astronaut" idea.

Go ahead.  And don't be upset when someone walks up to your mother and 
says "she died of a heart attack and couldn't get to a phone to call for 
help, or even tell her loved ones goodbye?  COOL!"
