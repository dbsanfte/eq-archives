I'd agree with bards, their pulling ability (at 65) is just so far
beyond anyone else. I haven't had that much luck with a cleric or
chanter pulling. Either they take too long  or they'll have one or two
pulls where they get into trouble. ... and if there's a train incoming
I'd prefer not to have it initially agro on the cleric or chanter. 

I much prefer a FD (or just a tank) puller over the latter two, things
just seem to run more smoothly. At least if the FD puller isn't hung
up on getting singles or the tank doesn't understand chain agro. 

Rgds, Frank
