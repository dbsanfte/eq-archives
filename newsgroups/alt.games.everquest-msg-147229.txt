The skeleton in TT: trivial.

The skeleton in CoM: probably need high level help.  The usual way to do
this one is that someone pulls it to near the zone, where you are waiting,
and then an Enchanter charms it, and you do the turn in.

The skeleton in KC: I've not done this one yet.  I've heard conflicting
stories on whether or not it needs to be charmed.  Assuming that it does not
need to be charmed, I've heard that this one is sometimes actually easy, if
you go at a time KC is crowded, so everything is camped...just walk right in
and do it.

Some people have multiquested this, making a Rogue to do the third skeleton.
Hide/sneak to the skeleton, and do the turn in.  That breaks hide/sneak, and
the stuff there kills you, but if you are quick, you can finish the turn in
before they whack you.  With the changes to under 11 death, this should be
even easier now, as you don't have to go back for the Rogue's corpse.
