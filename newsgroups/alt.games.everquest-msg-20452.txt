More precisely, the name one chooses for one's character is an
indicator of one's creativity.

Think again...

From:
http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/naming.jsp

6 - Common words and phrases that would not be found in the place and
time setting of the game (e.g. Switchblade, Phaser, Toaster, Cannabis,
Sloegin, Anyone).

and

13 - Names where the combination of the first and last name form a
phrase or violate a previous rule (e.g. Crymea River, Bran Muffin,
Story Thyme)

I have established no rules - I have merely stated opinion and made
observations.

In my opinion, the person who named his PC "Bill Gates" would be
suffering from a near-terminal lack of creative ability.

Further, he would be in violation of another of the naming rules:

5 - Non-fantasy oriented names from popular media. These names can be
either fictional (e.g. Rambo, Darthvader) or non-fictional (e.g. Garth
Brooks, Pierce Brosnan, Ronald Reagan, Michael Jordan). 

>Guess Bill Gates wasn't bright enough to come up with a fantasy name

>Corporation in the IT industry. But nooooo, not bright at all.

The Bill Gates you're referring to didn't give himself that name - his
parents did. Further, they weren't naming him as a character in
Norrath where naming rules apply. And finally, of course, you're
really reaching in even attempting this comparison.

Is it indeed? Well, I see above where I refuted your statements with
several hard references. By all means, feel free to debate them.

Your ego is suffering from serious over-inflation. Anyone familiar
with this newsgroup knows that I get involved in threads about the
naming policies because I have strong feelings about the subject.

I assure you, that your name was on the message was utterly
meaningless to me, until you pointed it out.

Knock yourself out. Your opinion doesn't have any real impact - the
only one that does is Verant's, and the link I provided above makes
their opinion abundantly clear. Regardless of how one feels about the
topic of names, the rules of the game still apply to them.

>Do yourself a favor, block me again.

Not just yet, thanks. I specifically took you out of my kill file some
time ago, after several people whom I respect told me that you had
become a positive contributor. While I disagree with your opinions on
this particular subject, I see nothing in your post that would make me
consider kill filing you again.
