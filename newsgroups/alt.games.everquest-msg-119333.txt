Aside from The Sleeper, what are the top 5 most difficult
monsters/gods/dragons/whatever to kill?

Another question, what is the hardest area to raid in the game? (I would
have to say the Shrine, in the Qeynos sewers because of all the guild
masters would make it impossible. NO ONE ever could clear that area.)
