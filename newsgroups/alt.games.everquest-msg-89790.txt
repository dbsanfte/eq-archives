What do you do when someone isn't holding their weight in a group? In a
pair?

I don't bother telling them that I do not think they are pulling their
weight because I don't see the point. If they are on the take, they aren't
going to admit it. If they just aren't a very good player... sometimes it is
hard to determine whether they aren't a very good player or if they are on
the take. Someone who is on the take will make it seem like they are pulling
their weight but really aren't.

What do you do?
