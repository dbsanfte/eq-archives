Pretty much.  Nonpermanent death is more of a hassle than an actual
death - more comparable to suffering a greivous injury than actually
*dying.*  A better sense of immersion could be attained if
nonpermanent deaths were actually displayed as less like dying where
appropriate, and need not come with lesser penalties than the
situations where nonpermanent deaths must be displayed as death.
