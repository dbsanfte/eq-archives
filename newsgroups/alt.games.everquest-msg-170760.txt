I used to xp in Karnor (so sue me, I like the zone) and and you find lots
of Cleric mobs  in the moat who will CH whatever you are fighting on land
but won't usually add.  The Shaman mobs haste other mobs, a nasty combo.

As Faned said multiple healer (especially Cleric) mobs are often a problem
as they will heal through walls, floors etc.
