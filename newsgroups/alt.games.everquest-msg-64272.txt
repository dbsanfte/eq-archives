Hi all,

I wonder what nightmare happened at Verant pushing the ETA further...

- The huge server patch crashed everything and they have to restore old
broken backups and redo incremental older patches

- The servers are out of disk space they are trying to quickly buy new
filers

- A nasty engineer done some rm -rf /  (Erase all without confirmation).

- The moon went away due to some stupid withard casting at sky direction
some trong energy spell. Now the moon run away Norath lik in "Cosmos 1999".

Pick one, add some
...

Lï¿½azarra
