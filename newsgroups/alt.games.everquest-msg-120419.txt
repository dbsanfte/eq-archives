That depends on whether or not you are playing a character or simply a
set of numbers.

I have an enchanter friend who is human and had a similar situation.
Her hubby started first as a warrior and when she started she asked
him about stats and he said Strength was important.  She put 20 of the
points into STR.  At your level she had an INT of roughly the same you
do.  

When she learned how INT and CHA were the key factors. for Enchanters,
she had the same concerns but felt the same way.  The character was
too much her, even if she started a new one she would never get rid of
the old one.  As I explained it to her, most people do what is called
Min/Maxing.  That being they set thier characters up to minimize the
negatives and maximize the positives.  Very few people are willing to
play an "Average" character.  

Does having the lower stats than the superhero's in the overtwinked
gear mean that you should start over?  Of course not.  It simply means
that you will be more of an "average" character.  At least with you
(unlike my friends enchanter) you only have to work on one key stat.
Look at it this way.  My main is a warrior with a 75 CHA but when I
put on my CHA suit I get to 109.  And that is with just 5 pieces
switched.  The same can be done for you and your wisdom.

With gear there is no reason you shouldnt be able to easily reach a
Wisdom in the 150 to 170 range.  It simply means your mana pool wont
be as large, and you will have to med more often.  Certainly not a
reason for me to start over if it were me.
