Yeah, my main reasons for not playing on a pvp server is that verant
in no way really supports it, the game is not designed for it all but
just has it pasted on, as the first poster above puts it so well you
are more or less just bullied into behavior, you still have ALL the
same detriments to accelerated play as on the blue servers but now
some guy can try to kill you when you are out getting xp and low on
health even though it is for really no gain at all to them.

PVP just brings in too much of a grief element while really offering
no advantage for me since I just don't have the bully mentality of
killing someone at an orc camp because I want to have all the spawns. 

If a game was totally designed for pvp and had it pretty well
regulated (like the seperated by huge areas team pvp you might see
working well in DAOC and AO) I might like it. I don't think I will
like shadowbane which will end up being kind of a mob rule king of the
hill type game. 

Many of us just want to play the game more or less like real life. In
real life if some guy cuts me off in traffic I have no desire to cause
harm to him as no real damage is done to me. Some people do have the
desire to cause harm to someone who cuts them off and this leads to
trouble. So like in real life I don't see the opportunity to cause
harm to another player as a benefit just because I don't like their
behavior.
