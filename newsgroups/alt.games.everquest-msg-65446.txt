I have a petnium 866 with 256mb ram and geforce2 ddr card.  I have
everything turned off or way down.  I had only the gnome and elemental
models turned on.  The only problems I have now are the open luclin zones.
The open area in Vah Shir City and all of Shadoweaver Thicket? ( slow waaay
down any time that huge planet is in the sky) are almost unplayable...can
barely move.  It's kinda sad that I had to turn off all the cool features
just to play the game.

I am definitely upgrading to a P4 1.7 and 512 ram...but I think what they
consider the minimum requirements to be are higher than what is listed.
