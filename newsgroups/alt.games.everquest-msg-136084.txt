Agreed. Just because one particular thing (such as EQ) doesn't work 
doesn't mean that Verant has a problem with their servers. Anything 
between a person's computer and an Everquest server can cause downtime, 
the number of people it affects depends on who is on that same route. 
Sometimes many can be affected, sometimes just a few. It's something we 
all live with when using the Internet.

The same could be said of ping times in-game. I'm currently on a 
640/272kbps DSL connection. It's never down and doesn't have lag spikes. 
That being said I generally get 400-1000 pings in Cazic-Thule, the server 
I play on. At the same time I can easily get pings of 30 in Half-Life or 
Counter-Strike games. This in no way means that Verant has crappy servers 
with slow connections. I played with two brothers last night who share a 
56k connection to play Everquest and get pings around 200-400. It's mostly 
the route, and unfortunately that's something not easily changed. Changing 
ISPs is often the only way to change that, and even then it's not 
gaurantee.
