    Snip. So you messed up, and instead of trying to figure out if it was a
hoax you did a knee-jerk "we got u seller phreak!" response. No biggie, just
admit it. Admit you messed up. Here, I'll admit I messed up in another
thread to help you get started:

    I buggered up what level clerics get Fear. I looked at the Caster's
Realm chart before posting to remind myself, but I didn't look hard enough
and mistakenly thought our first regular fear spell was Invoke Fear. I suck.

    See how easy it is?

    Now, if you really want to bust an E-Bay'er, head on over to
playerauctions.com now and go to the Quellious section. For sale is a level
60 druid. If you read the blurb on him, it'll mention that he has the title
"the Wanderer". Yes, it's my server's Best of the Best winning druid, and
this is the second time he's been sold. Guess the first person to buy him
got tired of playing a druid, even if that druid has two Vulak loots. The
first name of the character is Arkinia. I DEFY you to get Verant to ban that
account, based on it being sold. I don't think you can gather the proof to
do it, and it's quite possibly one of the most distinctive accounts on any
server. And if you can't get that account banned, what are the chances Joe
Blow's 55 WAR is going to get busted?
