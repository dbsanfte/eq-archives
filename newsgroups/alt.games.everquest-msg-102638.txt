Exactly. It would be one advantage and one disadvantage, for balance.
If Agil and dex REALLY helped a melee much (really 75 or more in both
is all you ever need) thant the higher dex and agil warriors would be
great. Meanwhile if Str and STA meant raw damage output and more
resiliance/HP to a LARGE degree the ogre warrior would be the number
one meat shield as long as he made his agil high enough.

As it is now the difference in level 60 warriors is fully their gear
and nothing to do with race. This is kind of sad. Even the no frontal
stun really does not come into play because your Master Tank just
stands there and maintains some aggro while it gets spam healed and
healed by a cleric CH chain. I've seen all races of warrior do it
equally well. The entire success of the fight is totally based on just
keeping them alive.

Their is just too much racial equality in EQ. Text muds I played on
were far more varied and the different races such as Half giant or
human were far better for some classes than others.
