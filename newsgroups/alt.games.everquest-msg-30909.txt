Perhaps I was a bit harsh, although to be honest, when my first character
was at level 11, I didn't have a clue where you could and could not tp to.
I would have asked to find out.  Still doesn't change the fact that Jam did
not know either, and apparently has no clue about Everfrost either, or about
the soloing capability of a level 11 warrior.  All of which he felt it was
necessary to point out to this apparent relative newbie.
