Well, common sense tells you that the people hanging around the gate
area of Freeport would be newbies resting up in the safety of the
guards unless someone is selling or buying items off that orge. Every
now and then someone may log in there that might be a level where they
can bind you, but if you just go to the next zone (NF) the bank is (
or should I say use to be) packed with people and that's how you get
your bind brother, go where the people are. Waiting around shouting
for someone to come bind you is not the same as just going up to
someone and asking personally.And yes, on occasion there might not be
any casters in the bank when I log on at some hours, in that case I
would bank and then go out to the tunnel in EC and there was always
someone there and what's that an extra 5 min to get from NF to the
tunnel. Like I said it's a lot harder for someone to say NO when your
asking they politely then spamming the zone with shout, no matter how
nice you do it.
