That depends entirely on the server.

Referring to a player by their character name doesn't necessarily
constitute roleplaying. Contrary to your belief, most people do not
roleplay. They simply PLAY the game. Example:

Pelpellon: what's up, furiouss.
Furiouss: Nothing much. Car broke down last week. Stuck on the road
for about an hour before a tow truck came.
Pelpellon: that sucks. btw, bought a new bp last night. ac 51!
Furiouss: Sweet!

That is not roleplaying. That's pretty much on-line chatting between 2
friends over EQ. When you start talking about your experiences growing
up in Neriak, or how you loathe that one merchant with the exorbitant
prices, or how your crops in the Karanas aren't growing as they
should, then you begin to roleplay.
