Hard to avoid morons, theyre everywhere.

Normally i sow or buff people if i can see them. If someone just do /who 
DRUID i tell them to find me if they want buffs. IF they ask where i am 
i tell them that if they dont know where i am, why are they asking me, 
why should i use time to run and meet them to buff them.

If they want PL, my price are around 1K a level at 1-15, 2K a level from 
15-20, dont PL after that. That usually make them understand i dont plan 
to use hours to PL them.

If they beg items or money, try to give them 1 cp or a rusty dagger and 
see what happens.
