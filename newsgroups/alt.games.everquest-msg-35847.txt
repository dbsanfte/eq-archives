DAOC is in october or something. 

When will there be a daoc group or when is it appropriate to make one?
Someone made an AO one I get in sometimes.

I want to know more about this game but everyone I know in the beta
never plays it even saying it is too EQ like yet they won't let me try
it.  It sounds like a bunch of new stuff was added in phase 4.
