I have been looking for a few things. My character is 18th level now, a
ranger half elf. I have been to the burrows and to oasis. Highhold and
Highhold pass. I have been looking for good drops and so far found mostly
bug parts. The gnolls in the burrows drop ear rings, chain and leather
armour, colars, and a shoulder pads with +6 str ac3. I see some of the most
awesome weapons and armour and I know they come from somewhere,  but where.
Where do I have to hunt to get some of the awesome stuff. You cant buy it
except from the bazaar, where I have been once and was the lowest level
there. I adventure mostly on antonica, should I try velious? What about
lucen? I would like to group with some people to get some good armour and
weapons, With a 100 str I hit for 23 damage with my elderwolf jawbone. My ac
is a measly 359. I have partied with some whose ac is bordering 700 and them
lower level than I. If you have some suggestions please let me know, I have
been grouping in oasis for days power leveling so I may go hunt bigger prey.
Thanks.
