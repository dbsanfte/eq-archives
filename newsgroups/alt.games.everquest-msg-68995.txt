Isn't that fixed?  I know that memory leaks that were killing my
shitty system are no longer there.  (PII-400, 384Meg, Ge2 200 64Meg)

I haven't had this happen in almost a week.  It was fixed for me the
patch after they fixed bard songs.

And a significant number of computer users are too damn stupid to be
allowed to fuck with their computers.  I can't believe the shit that
passes for knowledge going around out there.  Clean up your swap file,
set swap file usage to conservative, and ensure you are using the
latest (or latest stable) version of you drivers.  The rest of the
info I've seen is of dubious value at best.
The really odd thing is that the old models I'm getting much better
performance than I used to (probably related to my memory upgrade),
and with the latest changes, I can shut down almost instantly now
instead of the 2 minutes it took pre-Luclin or the 5-10 minutes it
took immediately post-Luclin.
If all else fails, do a clean install of your OS, update your drivers
and DX8.1, and ensure you have your swap file set to conservative, and
try.  Most serious NT/2k/XP admins I know rebuild their gaming system
every couple months just because of all the cruft that gets installed.
