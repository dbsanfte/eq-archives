My guild is able to assemble about 35 ppl with average lvl of 57. We got
Rhag'Morzdezh in ssraeshza temple down to 20% heath before we got wiped out.
Im pretty sure we could have taken him if we werent missing 2 clerics 2
wizzys and 4 warriors that normally are on. Are there any easier mobs than
Rhag'Morzdezh that drops C3?
