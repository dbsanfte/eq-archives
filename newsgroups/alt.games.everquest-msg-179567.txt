You know, some people are desperate for an excuse to jump on others. A
slight in wording, and I'm being taunted and flamed by egotistical
morons. (Gee, William's "question" seemed rather obviously rhetorical)
I notice nobody had any problem with my statement until Bizbee shoved
his ass into it with his usual "cite" chant that he loves the wail at
me every chance he gets (nevermind the so-called facts he's stated
without backing them up...)
