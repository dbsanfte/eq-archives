Erm all lvl 65 hard ldon dungeons? Don't even think about it without a damn
good group, well balanced, ornate+ gear and a bunch of aa's all around.

My normal group who farms normal dungeons in under 30 min all the time
doesn't stand a chance in a hard dungeon. We need a balanced selection from
the top 10 players of my guild to stand a chance. Only getting 2/3 of the
kills in the full 2 hours of the hard adventure puts a serious dent in your
ego when you breeze through normal :).

Pacify and lull get resisted a lot on hard adventures btw. We wiped a couple
of times because of a critical resist on a pacify and the chanter went down
in 1 round to 3 mobs. Trashmobs hitting for triple 933's is scary.

We're above ntov but slightly under emp/seru level btw. Ornate or better is
basically default for the lvl 65+.
