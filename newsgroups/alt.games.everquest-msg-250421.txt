Right... but i don't support the selling of either in-game items by
Sony or player accounts by the players. So it isn't my stance. Neither
of those things will ever be acceptable to me. I've only said it about
half a dozen times.

Now.. is there a way to bridge the two economies, that of the 'real
world' and that of the 'game world'? I do believe you could and have
elaborated on it in other parts of this thread..

>Why not manufacture items out of thin air?

I've answered this before... even in the previous post. It devalues
the current items.

But since I don't support SoE-sold items.. its a moot point.

Same thing here.

Agreed... and when you find someone in favor of SoE sold generated
items.. tell me.
