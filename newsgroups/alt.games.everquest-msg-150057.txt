}All I can say Remington, is he must behave significantly differently in
}game, in order to have led you to believe he is not an idiot.

True enough, he does, or rather did.  He did pull a couple moves of very 
questionable wisdom in game, but hey, we all make mistakes.  The point is, 
his posting here doesn't seem particularly idiotic either...  It seems 
more to fit the profile of someone who hasn't posted to USENET much, and 
doesn't realize that (a) flame wars are pointless, (b) getting upset 
because someone flamed you is pointless (and makes you look like a fool), 
(c) A lot has changed in the game since he was playing last, and (d) 
there really no such thing as 'a valid point', at least as he is using 
the term.
