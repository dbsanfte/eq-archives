Half true, and therefore false.  The more people sell to them the higher
they'll raise their "take" (i.e. the % +/- they go from the item base
price when selling/buying), and the more people buy from them the lower
they'll drop their take.  Whatever the actual mechanism, this appears
to work as a faction adjustment would, i.e. very high CHA can still
overcome the increased greed the same way very high CHA can overcome
the racial prejudices of otherwise fair-minded vendors.

If the vendor were popular primarily as a seller it wouldn't be a
problem, but if casters are dumping 200pp of vendor trash and
buying 1gp of malachite, well, heh...
