I'm already at 255 INT/255 CHA (enchanter).  Haven't really paid much
attention to the stat foods.  Is there an AC / HP / mana one?

I stuck with rations just for habit.  Back in the day, one food was just as
good as another, and rations/water were everywhere, so that's what I got. 
Milk and muffins were cheaper, but they were not available in as many
places.

Plus, iron rations cost six times as much as regular rations, but do not
give six times the duration.  I rarely use more than one stack of food/water
in a day, and just stock up again when I head back to town.
