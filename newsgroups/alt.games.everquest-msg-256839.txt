No you can't put no rent items in the shared bank. Oh well.

Some input into your main question: Warriors have extensively parsed the
effects of damage mitigation that AC provides, & it seems to go up by
increments of 50. 150 AC will be quite a bit better than 149, but 160 AC 
won't be much of a jump, if you notice it at all. There are much bigger 
leaps at 800 & 1000 AC. Monks have a hard AC cap at 1350, after wich 
there is no point in getting any extra, as it doesn't reduce damage.


So watch for increments of 50 as your AC goes down.
