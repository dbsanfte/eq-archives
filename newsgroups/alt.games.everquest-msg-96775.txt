There are 3 ways to increase your WIS.
1: Equipment, at lower levels mostly jewelry, later on usually from other
gear items as well
2: Buffs, temporary and usually not much increase
3: Alternate Advancement skills, only available when you're lvl 51+. You can
get 10 extra wis that way (5 times +2 wis)

Count on equipment for your current +wis help and also note that +mana items
are generally best for lvl 1-20 and when you get over 200 wis.
