Actuall there isn't that much difference between a Celeron vs. a Pentium
CPU.  A Celeron is a chip that didn't quite measure up to Intels specks.
Ex. a 1MHz chip that actuall clocked at say 940KHz will have the chash
burned and be sold under the Celeron name.... very simple example.  Its safe
to expect a Celeron to be within 10% of its rated clock speed but the chash
on a Pentium also effects through put and thus speed so there is probably
more like a 20 to 25% differance in speed between a 1K and 900 chip.

Yes but how much better depends on several factors.  Using a 4X/2X AGP card
in an older 2X/1X slot with only 256 memory won't run much faster than a
good quailiy PCI card in a machine with 384 memory if processors are the
same.

Yes memory will increase your EQ experience considerably and since RAM is
(not DDR of course) pretty cheep now a days its the most ecconomical way to
upgrade.
