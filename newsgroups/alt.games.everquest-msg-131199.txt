Not one person has ever snapped at me for rudeness in this context.
Not one.  zero.  If, as you say, my behavior has been horribly rude
I'd expect that number to be something other than zero.

Where have I ever written of getting in anybody's face?  Where have I
ever written of sending more than a single tell?

Another strawman.

Where is an argument (in-game) involved?  Trying again to imply that
I engage in harassment after carefully removing anything in my post
that spoke to the ephemeral nature of a single /tell?

I find your technique unimaginative:
- Almost without exception, you snip contravening examples, often
substituting strawman hypotheticals.
- You dodge <all> inconvenient questions.
- You almost invariably imply that the poster you're replying to is
advocating something or other that is regularly decried in the group.
- You usually throw up an extra strawman or two every post.

You really do need a new schtick, this one's been stale for months, if
not longer.
