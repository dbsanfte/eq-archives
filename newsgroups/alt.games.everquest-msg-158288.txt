EQ seems to have had some wierd start bugs the last few days. I had one 
2 days ago where i every time i typed in my password and pressed 
Connect, i got kicked to desktop. Had been in 2 times after patch, so 
knew it werent patch that had screwed something up.
Tried to install new graphic card drivers (at least i found out they had 
updated them, whee), DirectX 8.1, deleting all DLL files from EQ dir and 
repatch, delete all EXE files from EQ dir but the patch exe file, and 
repatch, rename Eqclient.ini and eqhardware.ini to see if that helped.
Nothing at all helped, so played other games for a few hours, and they 
tried again, and it worked. Never found out what was wrong.
