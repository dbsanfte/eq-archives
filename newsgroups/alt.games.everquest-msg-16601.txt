You can sell Batwings for 3-5pp a stack also. Either gather them from
bats you kill or buy them in bulk at the caster's guild in FP and
others places. You'll just have to check all the vendors cause they do
sell them in unlimited amounts (most ppl don't know this).

If you start a DE Enchanter, you can do the Stein of Moggok quest at
level 8. You can sell the Stein for 150-200pp or more depending on
your server. My first char was a DE Enc and I have never hurt for plat
after I did the quest dozens of times. You can use the cash to finance
your Jewerly skill so you can make even more plat.

>I'm sure you guys can come up with a lot more. But please only feasable for "normal" characters. Not a cha-maxed lvl 1 HIE enchanter and Baking. Although the skill might be profitable even for normal players so I might include it anyway :) Another good one would be the Gnoll Fangs from BB but I don't know the specifics for that quest right now.
