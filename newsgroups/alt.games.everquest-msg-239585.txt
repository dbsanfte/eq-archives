um....H***** did not actually *order* the doctor to specifically perform 
any particular experiments...he simply made the pool of innocent victems 
[and not just children, adults as well] available. Smart, NO. Persuasive 
and charismatic, yes. Evil, definitely...as were several thousand fairly 
evil people who took the opportunity to give in fully to evil. i think 
the Nuremberg trials sentence of hanging was much too lenient=(

I really wish he had never existed, as do most evereybody i know, and it 
is one time i really wish for a time machine and the ability to drop a 
cap on him before it all started. i dont think he was 'insane' so much 
as sociopathic...he knew full well what he was doing...which makes him 
sane enough to be tried [if he hadnt chickened out and killed himself]

Unfortunately, antisemitism was fairly widespread in european history as 
evidenced by all the various laws enacted throwing them out of assorted 
kingdoms, and the different 'pogroms' against them throughout most of 
the renaissance and modern eras.
