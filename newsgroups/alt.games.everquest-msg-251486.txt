I'm saying, as an experienced healer, experienced cleric, that no, heal 
and never do anything else isn't always the answer.

Frequently, with KEI and so forth stacked on you, a cleric's mana bar 
slaps the FM end repeatedly, fight after fight.  Cleric damage output 
isn't great, admittedly, but it can be in line with what a pet can 
produce, or the difference between a hasted and unhasted plate tank.  If 
the cleric can speed up kills by 10%, then that can make a difference.

Clerics have nukes, stuns, roots, a sort of DS, a great DS remover (its 
nominally a sort of DS like affair cast on a mob which heals you when 
you hit the mob, but the heal is so tiny as to be insignificant.  ON the 
other hand, it pulls a real DS right off the mob without affecting any 
debuffs your group may have cast on him.

ALl this is situational; often the best ploy for a cleric -is- to stick 
strictly to heal or heal and pacify... but here we were, in an LDoN 
where we were having a hard time keeping the kill rate high enough, yet 
the cleric was FM after most fights, and not doing anything but heal and 
pacify.  One good nuke per mob would add up to 10% more mobs dying per hour.

Later, after the cleric had died, he -then- started using his hammer 
pet, and running OOM.  This is the opposite situation, now there's not 
enough mana to do the main job, but the cleric is suddenly spending his 
limited resources on something he's not very good at... witness for 
example the fact that his pet kept dying to mob DS, removing that DS 
instead of worrying about the Hammer would have saved a lot more mana IMO.
