Certainly, an increase in genetic mutability under stressful conditions 
sounds like such an useful trait at the species level that I would be 
surprised if it had *not* been evolved fairly early on... that's what I 
meant by "Lamarck being right"; not that if you cut a mouse's tail its 
offspring will be born without tails, but that the exposure to, say, 
unfamiliar foods will increase the mutation rate until the species has 
adapted, at which point the stress is relieved and the mutation rate 
returns to normal.

Sorry, must ask again... are you talking about evolution or natural 
selection here? Because it's pretty much a binary choice: Either species 
change over time (by whichever mechanisms), or they appear in their 
final forms (by whichever mechanisms). Evolution or Creation... I can 
see no room for middle ground or alternative theories here.

Not even a theory, in fact, more a superstition, since it doesn't 
actually *explain* anything, it just changes what needs to be explained.

Actually, a more honest theory would be that the Earth has emerged fully 
formed out of a random quantum event. Hell, it is consistent with 
current scientific knowledge, and it's more Occam-friendly, as it 
requires no unnecessary multiplication of entities.
