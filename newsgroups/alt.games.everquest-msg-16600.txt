I actually tend to "fear" what I *do* understand.

I have come to the conclusion that I just plain and simply don't like people
in general. The more I learn about any culture the more I learn to dislike
about them. It all cames back to the same thing, people in general are very
"un-nice". You do meet exceptions, but the average is pretty piss poor.

Of course, the cultures I dislike the most are the ones I have shoved down
my neck all the time, namely my own (Australian) and others that are similar
(and whose media we share).

Cultures I am completely ignorant to? Well, I just sit back safe in my
ignorance and imagine that we are the only assholes, and everyone else is
much more civilised and generally a whole lot "nicer". So keep those travel
books and language guides away from me! The last thing I need confirmed is
my suspicion that humanity is just a cancer on this planet, and the sooner
we wipe ourselves out the better.
