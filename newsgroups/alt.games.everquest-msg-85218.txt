I spent a fair amount of level 45 in Nurga at the spiders.  It was awesome
soloing.  There are two spawns of two spiders each.  It works out to be just
about a perfect spawn rate for a soloing 45 shaman.  You the the dungeon
bonus, and the Nurga bonus.  It is never populated on EMarr, unless some
monk is doing that part of his epic, which is right near the spider area.
There are now wandering mobs.  So you never get adds, so long as you don't
stray far from the spiders.  After level 45, the xp drops, as some the
spiders start getting light blue and green.
