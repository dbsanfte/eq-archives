That seems reasonable to me.

How does this reconcile with the fact that many quests can be
multi-quested, yet quests still seem to track the players involved as
well.

Going back to my earlier example, I give Thirsty one flask of water,
when he wants four. I then walk away, or zone out, or whatever. Some
other player comes along and hands in three flasks, but he doesn't
complete the quest - Thirsty tells him he wants one more flask.

But then on the flip side, multi-questing is a well-known effect that
lots of people use, even though it seems to contradict the above
example.

I'm confused.
