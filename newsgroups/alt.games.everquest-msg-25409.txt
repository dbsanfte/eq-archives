Who in here is planning to create a character in the RP server, and what
would that be?

I'm definitely looking forward to playing there (Hell, if anybody
remembers when I used to post as Shrike, I used to get my big mouth into
every single RP-server thread, back when it looked like it would never
happen), although it will be hard to go back to rat-bashing when I
finally have a character over 30. :/

My character of choice will be a Human Cleric of Mithaniel Marr. I
always play humans, for some reason (much as they suck), and since I'm
an agnostic in RL, I'm ticked pink by the idea of roleplaying a
fire-and-brimstone religious fanatic, although I dread the long wait
until I can afford some kind of night-vision item. But then again,
that's one of the things that got me hooked on Everquest: The first time
that nightfall caught me out in the forest in East Commons, I nearly
shat my pants with fear, and I thought "man, this is GOOD".

So, what would be your character of choice in the RP server?
