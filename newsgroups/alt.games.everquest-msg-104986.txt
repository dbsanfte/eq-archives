> Just out of curiosity, are you a parent?


I am a parent.  And though I would never like to see any ill fate fall upon
my children, I certainly can't side with this crackpot placing blame on a
video game.  She has lost touch with reality (evidently this runs in the
family) and can't cope with the fact that her son is dead and NEEDS to find
a scapegoat instead of either letting it rest or pointing the finger while
standing in front of a mirror.  It's her foolishness that opened herself up
to ridicule such as that comic strip.
She's not even smart enough to interview on the subject properly, for
instance when she made some stupid statements to the effect of:
"I know he had other issues, BUT...the game, the game, the game, blah,
blah."  Bullshit.  Or my other favorite was something about "knowing money
won't bring her son back, but she wants Sony to feel pain where it counts
most, the wallet."
I have trouble categorizing her as a "concerned parent".  I am more apt to
lump her in with a small, yet disappointing part of society that is willing
to "cash in" on tragedy, creating more of a mess than you might have began
with.

I can easily, however, categorize her as a gold-digging, money-grubbing
ghoul with little remorse for her son.  I have a feeling she thinks she won
the lottery.
Now you know where part of the $3/month hike may be going.
