Of all the Rants & Flames I've read on various EQ boards, 2 ever have
been about deliberate misporting. One wound up being a mistake for
which the porter apologized (SFM vs. SFG) and one was somebody
bitching about being dropped in Burtcherblock instead of GFay. It's an
immediately bannable offense and one that does not even appear on the
grief radar.

Note that I did not suggest it was anything other than an intense
competition.
