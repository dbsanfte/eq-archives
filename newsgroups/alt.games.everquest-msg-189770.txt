I disagree completely.  It is WORLDS harder to get a group with most of
the other classes as opposed to the ones you mentioned.  Enchanter, to
me, is clearly overpowered in a sense that they can solo well, they are
highly desired in groups AND they are mandatory for raids.  No other
class has that kind of pedigree except for shaman perhaps.

Clerics and Warriors suck hard for soloing, but the trade off is that
both are constantly sought for groups (even if not quite so much in the
case of the warrior, owning to the fact that a Pal/SK can be superior at
the same role in some circumstances) and both are absolute must haves
for raids.
