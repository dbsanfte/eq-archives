Demonstrably false, throughout the history of the game.  But let's just take
this past month as an example.  The AA's were combined.  It didn't work. 
The "testing" needed to figure that out was simply logging in and trying one
of the changed AAs.  Because it is blindingly obvious that that wasn't done,
it is safe to say that there was absolutely zero testing.

I don't really complain about it anymore.  The only time I'll enter such a
conversation is when someone tosses out a pie-in-the-sky "Do you really
believe that they roll out major fixes without any testing?  That's absurd. 
Of course they test it."  When that happens, I have to point out how it
conflicts with reality.  =)
