You'll really have to do better then that...

If anything, (with regards to religion) the belief dictated the state
(back then) not the other way around..

However, if you want to further your own analogy, if this country had
been founded by open homosexuals, you MIGHT have a leg to stand on..

The fact that open homosexuality hasn't been an issue until the last
20 years or so, you would be hard pressed to come up with a logical
argument comparing the issue of church and state with the issue of
special rights and state.

By all means, keep trying though...  Your attempts are nothing if not
amusing...

Come to think of it, they are nothing AND amusing..  :^)  Just had to
spell that out for ya..  :^)

As far as my speaking for most Americans, I think I am on safe ground
as well.  While it might be human nature to resist something that is
forced upon you, regardless of one's personal feelings about it, I can
safely say that it IS, predominantly, an American trait as well...
