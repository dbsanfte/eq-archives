I have found that rangers pair very well with chanters.  They can heal
(though not as well as paladins).  They can snare, for fear kiting. 
The chanter's slows definitely help compensate for poor ranger defense
skills.  The ranger will bring down a MOB before a paladin will.  And
finally, this is a big one, they can get aggro *off* the chanter
faster than any other melee.
