 Or North Freeport. Depending on server the auction zone may not be EC.

 You should try and keep them up each level but it's not really
required. I didn't pick up a 2hb until around level 45. Especialy with a
fast weapon like a fighting baton, it wont take long to increase those
neglected weapon skills.

 They drop on the second floor really. But the point is the same. You're
more than likely not going to get fighting batons at level 14 any other
way except for buying them or having someone give them to you.

 If you want a 1hb you can probably get an essence of dol (10/28
Secondary I think) for free. Just zone into Droga and see if Chief is
camped. More than likely he is. Ask that person (nicely) if you can have
one. They are lore and drop fairly often so they end up going to waste a
lot. The most it would cost you would be 22p for two invis potions. I'd
wait until at least 17 though so you can try to feign if the potion
wears off and things go bad. CR would be tough there for a low level
individual.
