Heh last I know Yantis is a person lol.
This is no rumor he has sold buy most accounts a several million plat
and keeps a full time staff. Most of the plat comes from high end
guilds where takes on a single raid can amount to 100kp or more. He
buys this for about $200 or so per 100k and sells it for two or three
times that amount. What you must consider is the scale of his
operation is huge compared to what one person could produce.  Like it
or not he is rich from EQ but the only example I know by name that
reaches into 6 figgure range. He may well be the largest single force
of the EQ economy there is outside of SoE itself. Not being
judgemental here just stating what most of us know as fact.
