It seems that everyone draws a different line.

Some draw the line at "shammy", some draw it at "plz". Some draw it when it
is a beggar saying "plz", but not in a group situation when they say the
same word. Some say it's ok when the person is offering to do them a
service, but not when they are asking for something.

Some feel strongly enough to tell the person they don't like it, and others
(like me) don't use it, but don't feel strongly about it one way or another.

Even if you could prove conclusively (as I believe the case is, anyway) that
saying "plz" and "thx" was neither lazy nor showing a lack of respect, I
still don't think people here would accept it.
