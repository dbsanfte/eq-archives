That's the main reason I won't run EQ under Win2k.  It really does feel
'tighter' running under Win2k - but I get the sound cutting out
(thunderclap - breaks up - real immersion breaker) - and my MP3's and CD
audio chop up while playing them behind EQ.  On the 9x and ME line, this
isn't a problem.

Hmm... I only usually get that while switching screen resolutions for the
first time after a clean install.  Some in the spellbook view that goes away
when I mouse-over it or simply Ctrl-B or stand up and Ctrl-B to the book.

Give up running it under Win2k with *at least* that sound card. =(
