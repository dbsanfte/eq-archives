In Shadowhaven, just north of the spires and to the right of the 
Soulbinder, there is a door. Inside there you will find a secret
passage which leads to Echo Caverns. 

Through Echo Caverns you need to head generally west -- beware
the non-targetable tentacle/plant things, they are traps which
root and DoT you -- and you will get to Fungus Grove. A map
is recommended since wrong turns will take you into some nasty
spots.

In Fungus Grove there is nothing dangerous that I found between 
the zone and the shops where the fellow you seek resides.
