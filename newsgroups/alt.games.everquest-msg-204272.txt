I know you said you liked the FBSS, but sell it, for some odd reason people
like these and are willing to pay almost as much as a cheap pair of SCHW so
it wont take much effort to make up the diffrence.

The SCHW has more haste (1% i'm lead to believe) and ac and stats, plus with
the ac from your new waist item (Chitinous belts are dirt cheap nowadays)
your going to end up gaining AC and Stats, which can only be good.

Maybe consider a Glimmering Mithril Torque for your neck,

AC 15 Str 2 War only

I got one for 100pp the other day seemed a rather good deal.
