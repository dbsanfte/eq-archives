I have a question for my fellow monks.  I've been trying to raise instill
doubt since level 18.  I'm level 25 now, and it's only risen one point in
the last seven levels.  I put a training point into it  at 18 and I use it
constantly when traveling or waiting for a group, yet is still won't raise.

I'm sure I'm missing something simple here, any advice?

(btw, I heard whatever kick you have maxed will effect Instill doubt.  My
round kick is maxed at 130.)

Thanks,

Chingach
Level 25 Monk
