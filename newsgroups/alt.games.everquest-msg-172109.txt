Hey guys, I hope that this helps, as I know how frustrating lack of EQ
can be:

When there are major pathces (as in the PoP release), I often have a
similar problem.  The EverQuest login works through the server select,
but crashes to the desktop when the character select screen should
load.

The solution seems to be to minimize the CPU load at startup and then
gradually increase to your usual gaming settings.  To do this, enter
the OPTIONS screen at login and lower your screen resolution to the
lowest possible settings  (i.e 640x480 or 800x600 whichever is lowest
for your VGA)  I do not think that you have to alter other graphics
settings (I never did) but you may want to turn off other features if
this does not work for you the first time.

I also highly recommend that you turn SOUND OFF - this seems to be
integral to solving the problem, as the MP3 playback of the theme
music is CPU intensive as well.  Now you can log into EQ as usual, and
the character select screen should appear.  Select a character, enter
the game, hit <alt>-o for options, select the DISPLAY tab, and bring
your screen resolution back up to its usual setting.  You cannot turn
sound back on from within the game, so you will have to log and alter
the sound settings from the log in OPTIONS screen.

You may find that it works better to log in once with low resolution
and no sound, alter resolution to your usual settings, log out, log in
with usual resolution on, log out, turn sound on, log back in, and
play.  The key to this procedure is to enter the game with the lowest
possible settings and work your way back to normalcy.

After doing this once, the problem should be fixed and you can log in
with your usual settings.  THIS WORKS FOR ME, and in no way am I
promising that it will work for you.  Try it though, as I don't see
how it could hurt.

If this works for anyone else, let me know - I would be interested.
