No. XP and loot comes from a quest NPC at the entrance of the dungeon, 
who gives the rogue different missions that require Pickpocketing, 
assassinating high-DPS, low HP mobs (so they can be killed, if lucky, by 
a successful backstab) and perhaps tricky collection of ground spawns in 
mob-saturated areas, or the opening of trapped treasure chests beyond 
locked doors.
