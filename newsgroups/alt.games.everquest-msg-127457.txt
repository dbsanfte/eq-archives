First of all, curse words with me doesn't imply that I'm angry. It
implies that I don't have this stupid hang-up over curse words being
"bad". Second of all, I'm insulted because you're walking in here
acting like we're all stupid enough to believe your flimsy cover-up.
You're selling the account. That simple. It doesn't matter what you
call it, as soon as the price exceeds the value of the software
(which, being used, is less than shelf value), you're charging for the
account. Even without charging for the account, you're violating the
license.

Not without a key, which the one that comes with the software your
selling would be used.
