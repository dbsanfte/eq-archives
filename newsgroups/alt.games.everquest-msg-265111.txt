The mask mentioned by an earlier poster looks fairly nice; I think
it would still be an upgrade for my 45 monk, so I'm trying to net
one.  The commanders are DB but I wasn't able to make much headway
soloing one of them and eventually had to feign death.

I see people talking about working on magic resist to deal with the
Fear cast by some of the skellies, and more generally I see people
talking about resists in the 100s and up.  Even at level 45, with
what I thought was some decent but hardly uber gear, I find mine
range from 40 to 75.  (Sorry, don't have a Magelo.)  How do people
get their resists so high?
