My experiment above tells me that this isn't necessarily true.  Slowed 
mobs don't hit all that often.  DS only does damage when the mob hits. 
Even with only a 53 shaman doing slowing, the dulak mobs weren't taking 
much DS damage at all.  33 damage per hit, 310 mana to cast (because I 
end up casting it on my pet also for a timer), the DS has to get hit 37 
times in order to come up to nuke level effectiveness.  Qadding mobs hit 
4 times every 3 seconds more or less, so thats 150 seconds to break 
even, unslowed, but slowed 50% thats 300 seconds, slowed 75% its 600 
seconds... so yes, I suppose it is still more effective assuming you 
constantly have a mob in camp hitting the target.  In a pull wait pull 
situation, though, well those mobs aren't lasting 600 seconds each, 
you're going to be losing DS time.  (Oh, those times assume the target 
never misses a dual weild, double attack, or swing, and that your buddy 
with the DS on never dodges, blocks, ripostes a swing, and that 100% of 
swings are at the MT or mage's pet)

Yep, yep, often inaccurate, behind the times, but the format is much 
simpler and more understandable than the Lucy everyone raves about; I've 
almost never been able to find any useful information out on Lucy.  I'm 
sure its all there somewhere, but buried under all sorts of things that 
don't make any sense to me.

I want simple stuff.  For each class, what spells are available at each 
level, where can I get them (or are they drop only), how much mana to 
cast, and what do they do.  Castersrealm -almost- manages this, although 
its often hard to figure out exactly what the effect is at any given 
level... and then there's discussion of the spell right underneath with 
more (admittedly also often inaccurate) information and suggestions.

I'd love a site compiled with Castersrealm's basic plan, only by someone 
with access to Lucy's data and the ability to translate it into english.

Well, thats how I thought it worked too.  But again, what about pet 
killing?  Often mob pets are lower level than their casters, drop 
nothing, and give practically no exp.  I can't think of a situation 
specifically, but perhaps the spell would be worthwhile on them?

Well, unless there's a mob similar to Bloodmaw (level 6 mob with 100k 
hp) we won't be able to tell the difference between removed from game 
and 10K hp nuke, how many mobs under level 46 have more than 10k hp?

Whats more important, 20% more pet damage output or 20% less mob damage 
output?  My money is generally on air thus far, but perhaps if I can 
train the MTs to keep pet behind mob that won't remain true.

Thats how my shaman usually did it, course the "mob will follow" part 
can be problematic, and then you have situations where pets are shoving 
the mob around and room gets tight.

Manastorm is level 59 spell, not 60.  I think I forgot to discuss the 59 
spell list, 59 was over so quickly!

Honestly, while I've heard aggro complaints, I've never had any of my 
own as a mage.  I'm the person least likely to get hit in most parties 
I'm in, can't tell you how often I'm the only one in the group at full hp.

A few levels back (I think I was 55?) I went on a hedge maze run, when 
we got to the boss we rested, so I was FM, I dumped every last bit of 
mana I had and more (sitting on mount with all the mana regen except a 
bard, and ate a mod rod charge), as fast as I could chain nuke, and the 
mob never looked twice at me.  I'm sure this becomes a problem 
eventually, but thus far I've been unable to make it happen, even in a 
case like this where (Knowing we had overkill) I deliberately went flat 
out hoping to get myself summoned and possibly killed.

In Exp groups I've been able to get aggro, but it generally required 
mismanagement on my part, a little more care and timing eliminates that 
and doesn't eat into my DPS, I'm still limited by mana regen and the 
relatively small size of my nukes more than anything...

And due to resists, rains seem to me to be best DPS only on paper.

Just like you say here.

And those boss mobs hopefully are tashed, malasini'd, and OOS'd, a 
combination you rarely see on an exp mob, should improve the resist 
situation a bit.

Well, that makes sense for boss mobs of course

I think you are right, here, but I'm still thinking about it.  I mean, I 
was in a situation a couple days ago where I was getting a resist every 
second mob on malosini.  This means I was casting an average of one and 
a half malosini per mob, or 300 points spent.  The lower level shaman we 
were with was having significant trouble sticking slow, it was rare that 
it would stick before malosini landed.  From previous experience in 
similar situations, its likely that Malaise would have done the job just 
as well as Malosini (sticking just as easily, and allowing shaman slow 
to land just as easily), I was using malosini because of its fast recast 
time.  If I'd used Mala instead (didn't have it at that point, but -if-) 
I'd have spent more mana per mob on average, but less time, and the mobs 
would have been slowed faster.

Now admittedly if you are using it raid style, mala followed by 
malosini, then I can't see it being a good use of mana in an exp 
situation, 550 mana just to land some resist debuffs?

MS I and MS II pets cast FireElementalAura, which is the same thing that 
Fire pets cast.  And in play, with two mobs on them, the second mob 
seems to take significant DS damage, looking very much like they are 
taking the same DS damage as they would have beating on a Fire pet; 
thats noticably more than mage cast DS at the same level, and Worlds 
more than O'Keills.  Fire pets over level 50 cast O'Keills, and rarely 
cast their FireElementalAura, but -will- eventually do so (it even 
stacks with O'Keills!), one way to get them to do it is to run them 
completely OOM.  They do indeed suck massively, with low HP, low melee, 
and being obstinant about casting their DS, Plus some of the spells they 
cast are worse than useless, Annul (I've almost never been in a group 
where some kind of debuff wasn't being cast on the mobs) and AE nukes 
(waking mezzed mobs, breaking root on rooted mobs) come to mind.  This 
is -why- I was thinking the MS III pet would be great, earth pet HP, GV 
Fire DS, and none of the casting nonsense.

But you aren't the first person in this thread to say they didn't get 
the "GV upgrades"... what are those exactly?

I've done the same thing at previous levels where a bolt is my big gun; 
using bolts in a group where you see 5 out of 6 members with a pet 
(mage, beastlord, 2 clerics, wizard, warrior :)) gets messy indeed even 
with levitate on and standing on top of the mob.  I'd never rely on bolt 
style spells as the only damage I have memmed.

Well, the No Drop part probably isn't true on Firiona Vie, where so very

When my cleric was doing AE groups, mana was often an issue; group would 
  dump their entire mana bar doing AE as fast as they could, and then on 
more than one occaision it would come down to a race between cleric 
clicky boots and the enchanter's mana holding out long, with the wizards 
desperately medding up for one more AE.  At one point we had half the 
group LD and my cleric got the kill on 30 mobs.

I got a copy last night for 5kpp, which is doubtless too much for what 
it does, but I'm one of those annoying spell book junkies who find it 
almost irresistable to get every spell, and this does have obvious 
utility in making the impossible possible; mana inefficient it may be, 
but it did let me keep my air pet alive off tanking a cave lord (level 
61) while the group took down King Drognar; previously I couldn't pull 
that off chaining primal remedy and the 52 heal unless the cave lord was 
slowed.

I do, and I do.  So it seems like a good deal sort of, only I need to 
keep it memmed but rely on the 52 one whenever possible instead.  I'll 
be much happier chaining this with it than I was chaining the 44 heal, 
though, in a bad situation that little thing wasn't helping out nearly 
enough.
