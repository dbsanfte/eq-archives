It isn't a bash at anyone, it's a statement of fact.  WoW is an easier game,
which the majority of people seem to prefer.  Having played all MMORPG on
the market, compared to EQ they are all easy, dull, and require less
brainpower.  However, that doesnt mean people have to agree with me, I dont
care what others play...
