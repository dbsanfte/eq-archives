Its what has turned me off of EQ.

I decided to check some web sites, and found that the drop items I
need for Freeport newbie warrior gear is dropped, for example, by a
huge rattlesnake. Which is 8-11th level. And my character has a 15
save vs. poison. This comes across as very poor, or stupid, design.

Another is I couldn't find brick of crude bronze on Stromm server
for the emerald warrior gear, and on another server my other
characters could find that, but not another item for the same armor.

The drops for beginning armor should be easier to get. After all,
its for beginning characters. By the time I can take on a 8-11th
level monster, that armour isn't all that good of protection.
