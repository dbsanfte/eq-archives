Hear, hear. The fact that EQ works at all amazes me, frankly, and people
give SOE far, far too little credit on that. It's not like they have the
option to recode everything from scratch, they are stuck with the code
as it is, and while something can be said that some of the early
programming may not have been great, when you consider the fundamental
changes things like levels to 65, and AAs, and such mean on a CODE
level... Shit happens. They fix it. They had a patch up to fix this
problem in like 2 hours. If not less. 

Things break. It's the nature of programming on a massive scale. It
/WILL/ happen. It is not possible to prevent it, in the end, the best
you can do is react quickly, and I think they handled this one just
fine. So, please, cancel your account. :)
