Hey, Dom. First of all, congrats on 33 and getting the second cougar claw
earring. I still just have the one, but I may go back in the next few days and
join our lovely guildmistress in an effort to get the second.  Right now,
however, I'm fighting on the ledge in OT and making some really good xp. Would
like to get out of hell level.
  Secondly................ (deep breath)
GO READ THE THREAD ON GNOLLS IN ICECLAD!
Eeeeek!  When you took us over to kill those gnolls, did you have any idea we
might be screwing up our faction with the Dwarves????  OMFG.  You and I may have
to make a trip to kill some Uthorks as soon as we have the firepower to do it.
Let me know.
