Sadly, I'm forced to give the benefit of the doubt and say that some
people honestly don't even *know* about the naming rules. (This doesn't
excuse it or mean that names in violation shouldn't be changed, just
that some folks may not be "enjoying" breaking the rules.) Excellent
example; in my old guild, there were a bunch of people with names that
obviously violated the naming conventions. Nothing profane, etc. but
clear violations, trying to be cute, etc. And being the hypocrite that I
am, I didn't petition them. :-p

But this week I stopped in on their message board and saw a thread
posted by one of them which she had entitled, "Can you BELIEVE this
shit???". Whenever I see a thread like that, here or elsewhere, my first
thought is usually that I won't be able to believe the person is asking
the question. This was to be no exception. She posted about how somebody
had obviously petitioned her name and her surname had been removed. (It
was clearly a slight mispelling of a popular movie star's name.) She
then went on and reposted the list of naming rules which the GM had
pointed her towards and asked if anyone else had "ever heard of this
bullshit before."

Some people simply don't use their computers as an informatoin resource,
don't look things up on the web, and see them as nothing more than very
expensive playstations that can get e-mail.

*shrug*
