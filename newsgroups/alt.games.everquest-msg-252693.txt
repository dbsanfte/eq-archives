you could try...
/target an explorer
/pet attack

Even if your pet cant get to it, it can taunt at range and bring it to you.
This is a good trick when you have to pull the mob off the second floor of
com, but for that you need to chain shifting sight to get a target.

You could also try and aoe spell if you have a druid thats doing the
tracking.
