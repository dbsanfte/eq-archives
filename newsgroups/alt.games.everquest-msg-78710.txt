Yeah, once you've cleared VP several times and have cleared NToV, but 
we're talking much less than 1% of the playerbase here, probably less than 
1% of the level 60 playerbase even.  Compared to the necro mask which was 
pretty easy to get in the 40s I heard.  I know my necro guildleader spent 
about an evening getting all the pieces for it.

I didn't know this.  Any idea what the percentage is?  I'm still unsure 
how mobs decide whom to summon.  I greatly doubt clerics are doing any 
melee damage, yet they seem to be summoned pretty regularly.  I've been 
summoned with very little melee damage done, and have just taken to 
pulling with debuffs only.
