The only Druid that has ever ported me for free is Anwyn, and she's my guild
leader.  I understand it's a good way to make money for Druids, and I don't
hold that against them.  What I do dislike is the attitude of "Verant can't
make all the classes more playable, it ruins our business!  We insist that
Verant change things back to the way they were, at the expense of all the
other classes, for our benefit!"

And you accused me of being greedy?

Oh, and by the way, I'd love if all priest classes got Rez.  I'd also love
it if I could bind my pally anywhere, just like a caster.  Adding more
versitility to the classes helps anyone they're likely to fight with, or
anyone who may need their services.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
