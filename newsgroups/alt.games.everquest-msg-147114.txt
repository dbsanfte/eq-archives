I have a cleric friend who was grouping last night with a fighter who had
been buffed by druid to PL. The Fighter was doing all the attacking so the
cleric was just sitting around meding since all the mobs were resisting her
nukes. Out of frustration the cleric just sat down and watched all the
fights not participating at all she was getting about 1/7 of a blue per
kill. Now towards the end she started healing the fighter pawn out of
boredom (high lvl cleric was out of group with druid) and noticed she was
getting 1/3rd of a blue per kill. I was always under the impression when you
group the exp was split evenly among the group, yet she swears she was
getting more exp when not just medding. So the question is, does exp get
split evenly through a group or does your participation in the party make a
difference ?
