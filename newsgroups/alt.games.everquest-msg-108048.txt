  On a related note to all this, I have a pet peeve I just discovered 
last night. My server has a "taxi" channel like many others, and I stay 
tuned in to it. Last night, someone on the channel said "WTB port from DL 
to WC". (For those of you not up on your abbreviations, he wanted to buy 
a teleport from the Dreadlands to West Commonlands.)
   Within ten seconds, I replied in the channel that I'd be right there, 
and to meet me at the druid ring. I teleported to the Dreadlands, found 
him, hailed him, invited him to group...and he rejected my invitation.
   I'll spare you the gory details of the conversation that followed. The 
gist was that he'd already gotten a ride without telling me. He claimed 
not to have seen my message in the channel. Okay, fine. Miscommunication. 
It happens. I ported back to my original location. 
   Ten minutes later, someone else asked for the same port in the 
channel. Again, I said in the channel that I'd be right there, and to 
meet me at the druid ring. This time I got a response saying that the guy 
was on his way to the druid ring. 
    When I teleported in and waited five minutes for him to run to the 
ring, he told me upon arrival "Oh, another_druid_05 is already taking 
me." Argh.
   Now, I'm a pretty easygoing guy, and I don't require a lot from 
people..but one of the things I *do* ask is that if I offer to teleport 
you, but you've already made other arrangements, TELL ME before I waste 
the mana to schlep my ass halfway across the world, okay?

"I'm sorry, did I offend you just now? Pardon me--I'm
sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Really, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my 
attitude? Should I change my whole way of  being? Huh? 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
