But do you *like* Spam? I'll eat bugs if I'm hungry enough, but I don't 
prefer them. Spam is kind of like bugs to me, except I think I'd still 
rather eat bugs.

My main issue with Spam is not the taste, or even any physical 
characteristic of it. It's the... the Spam... *zeitgeist* really. The 
whole experience of it. Well, maybe not zeitgeist, but some German word, 
I'm sure. The Germans are really good at words for this kind of thing.

Yes, I am aware that this makes me something of a kook in regards to 
Spam and other Spam-like "meat" products.
