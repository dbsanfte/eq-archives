Hay Wizz,

Check me on this...

The ONLY thing I got outta Lesa's gobbledy-gook was that she believes
that people are gay even when they are dead...

She said "It is my understanding that being gay is based on the desire
for and pleasure engaged in intercourse with someone of the same
gender."  (Although her assertion doesn't differentiate between gay
and bi, but that's another argument.)

I wasn't aware that someone can have desire and feel pleasure when
they are dead...

Damn, that must be one Rosie Colored world she lives in!!  :^)
