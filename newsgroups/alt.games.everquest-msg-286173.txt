I've been on the road for the past 4 months, I could only get online via 
  the free wi-fi connections at Whataburgers and so on.  Oddly, these 
connections were good enough to let me use the web and get my email, and 
even in some instances to play EQ (never had enough time to do much, but 
I could log in and chat with guildmates about how much not having a 
connection at the shop was annoying me) but I couldn't get newsgroups.

I guess I could have gone thru google groups or the like, but I'm 
partial to my mozila style interface and didn't take the time to figure 
out a web based alternative.

Besides which, when you're not playing, the newsgroup is even less 
thrilling than usual!
