Of course, he is a career beggar. Most of them are like that. He put it
on to be polite but he was thinking of larger items. Most likely his
equipment is in a bag or in the bank.

That is why you don't give stuff to beggars, ever, since doing so
reinforces bad behavior. Roleplay it as you do in real life when on the
street some guy, you know will spend it on liqour or drugs, begs you for
spare change. If in a large city you just look at your shoes and keep
walking. You could even emote that in game as a way to have fun...

If you give someone to someone when they beg,  begging becomes their
occupation. If you don't, they have to find a real one. I often give
extra things I can't sell to people but I give them to people who DESERVE
them in the same way a GM might in a quest. I also give it to someone who
already is partially along themselves. For example, giving a blackened
crystilline robe to a newbie is bad form but if you see a guy you figure
is around level 25 or 30 and is wearing an FBR its more appropriate. You
could even offer to trade them the blackened robe for their FBR, which
you could then give to someone lower/less fortunate. They will think you
are nuts but probably like that deal.
