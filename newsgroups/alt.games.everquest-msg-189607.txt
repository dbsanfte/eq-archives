I decided to spend some time in the warrens with my level 30 necro, to 
get to know the dungeon, and farm some basic equipment for my alts.

Now almost everything cons green to me, but for the King and his High 
Shaman. THey con blue, and can easily be overtaken by me Seperately, but 
the problem is moslty, you pull one, you get three :) Thereby the King 
uses harm Touch for about 220HP, so that's either a good deal of my own 
health, or of my pets health. I'd like to take the damage myself, to back 
off and tap it back, but some bad stuns, and hits for 30-40 a pop, will 
finnish me off quite quickly.

So I've been thinking on some tactics, and would like some feedback.

First thing I fear the King's pet away for a minute, which is more then 
enough time for me finish off both the king and his shaman. Then I put up 
my necro harmshield and wade in, hoping the king's harm touch will bounce 
off off me, then my pet will start assisting me by killing of the king, 
while I back off out of the fight, waiting for my spells, so I can 
proceed csating both mobs to death. When the kings pet returns, I'll just 
let my pet finish it off.

Anyone any idea if there are any (fatal) flaws in this tactic ??

Thanks in advance,

Khalistro
