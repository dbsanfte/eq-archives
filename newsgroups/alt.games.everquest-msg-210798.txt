Plus for the wolf part, a damn nice inventory slot clicky.  Insta cast self

Or item for any slot, for many of us weapons are after all no different than
boots or belts or hats or earrings.   Its not like your shaman is going to be
contributing any real DPS hitting something with a stick by the time he's of
a level to get his epic, after all.  To the extent that the shaman epic is a
damage producer, its the mana free dot that does it.

For melee, the lameness of epics is more evident, because mudflation has
introduced substantially better melee weapons since the kunark era, so much
so that trickle down combined with the fact that a weapon is the most
important thing a melee can have, means that those weapons are often in your
hands before you could concievably get your epic, and certainly if you
continue on up into a moderate level raiding guild will be outmoded by
subsequent no drop weaponry.

Note, looking over people arguing to the contrary, that no one is talking
about the damage/delay ratios on those things, its all about "as an offhand
weapon for the haste" or something like that.  Why?  Because you can buy a
better ratio weapon for a song, compared to the effort it would take to
actually get the epic.
