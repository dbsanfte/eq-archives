Err, since you are giving up your melee chars can I have your dodge, 
parry and riposte skills?  I don't want your stuff <g>, but as a cleric 
I don't care what my damage output is  nearly as much as I worry about 
the damage I'm taking.  Until I see them giving clerics paladin level 
defensive skills I'll still let a real melee character tank for me if I 
can find one, thanks.
