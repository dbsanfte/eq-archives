   Yeah, I thought this was kinda sucky myself.  At the time
I was being considered by a role-playing guild, though I had
not yet been accepted.  I am now; it seems to be a good
group of people, and I certainly wouldn't drop out of it to
participate in a large scale PvP free-for-all the the event
turned out to be (on FV, anyways).  And I can't imagine any
guild leader worth their salt disbanding a guild for this
sort of thing.  If one did, I should imagine that they would
have a hard time reforming (I know I would think twice about
rejoining a guild disbanded in this way).  
   I think it would have been better just to turn WFP into a
PvP zone, and leave it at that until the event was over. 
But I don't know how hard that would be to code, or if they
would likely mess it it (make the whole server PvP, or
something).
