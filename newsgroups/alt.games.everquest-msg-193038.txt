But, even the Raid system seems a bit kludged together for me.  (Invite to
the raid, join a group (why?))  Why didn't they just allow raids to form
with out the groups?  Probably would have had some issues with seeing health
bars, F-key targetting, etc., beyond just increasing the size of the group.
So, it probab;ly is more than just one variable that would need to change.
