Bash is never going to be a huge damage dealer. As a 47 warrior I
occasionally bash for a critical hit of 28-30 or so, but usually hit for
around 12-15. As a large race (barbarian) I can still bash while dual
wielding, which is nice.

However, bash was not really designed with dealing damage in mind, I
believe. What it is meant for is to disrupt casters before they can get a
spell off. This is quite useful, especially when the casters you begin to
fight at high levels can send a huge dd spell at you, or get off a nice heal
to keep you fighting a bit longer.

So, keep bash trained. But, as a melee, it is important to keep as many of
your offensive weapons skills maxed as possible. You never know what kind of
nice weapon may fall into your lap some day.

Hope this helps. Keep bashing.
