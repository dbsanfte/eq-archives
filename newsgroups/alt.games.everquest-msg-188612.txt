I have yet to see a hasted pet kill faster than my regular xp group, and not
one of us has the best gear around or 300 AAs. Not all of us are even 65
yet, I only just dinged (and re-dinged, and re-dinged, I hate breaking
spawns in BoT) 65 myself.

That is a completely different issue, you were talking about an enchanted
pet's damage (I am defining "enchanted" as meaning "charmed by and
enchanter"), not about a duo or having a bot around. Your argument is coming
apart at the seams.

Oh, not one bit of down time, since enchanters are ressed with FM and KEI

Yes, they can run around training other people and getting adds left, right
and center. And I said druids have less ability to solo at low risk * as
compared to druids in lower level zones *

If you can escape the overcrowding and adds.

Never wanted you to felel sorry, just to stop bellyaching.

I hear the voice of someone who has never played a druid, never dealt with
charms breaking in record times, roots repeatedly breaking or being resisted
because druids don't get the AA's that make their spells harder to resist,
never actually done any of the things he talks about druids doing. I'd LOVE
to see your face the first time your charmed PoS frog breaks charm and the
mob he was nicely tanking for you summons you repeatedly as your SoE'ed ass
tries to run away and recharm the frog or zone.

Any group working half as hard as a solo druid who is attempting to quad,
DC-kite, charm-kill or root-dot is getting close to as much exp per member
as the druid is getting alone.

Oh, and interesting contradiction in your post:
