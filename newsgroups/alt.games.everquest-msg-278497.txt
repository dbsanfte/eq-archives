Spending a lot of time at Dawnshroud Peaks.  Kentigern has levelled up two
or three times while playing there.  And it's fairly easy to group as well.

I have a few low(er) level alts that I'm playing on occasion.  I keep
deleting and starting new ones, trying to get a feel for the different
combos.

Stumbled onto the Test server yesterday and had lots of fun.
