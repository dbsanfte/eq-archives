So. In one day, SOE announces how the SOL expansion is going to allow for
post 50 char advancement (though in vague terms), details the benefits of
the SOL engine, reveals that they are retexturing the old world (for an
unspecifed price), they're upping hybrid melee effectiveness in the end
game, and oh yeah, they finally lowered resistances on endgame mobs.

Someone remind me, when does DAOC go live again?  I'm sure it's a pure
coincidence, of course.
