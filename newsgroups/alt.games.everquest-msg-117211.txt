Basically the game is pure level based.  You can meet a group of friends
early in your career, but less you play the same amount as them, they will
outlevel you and thus you won't be able to play together.  In a nutshell the
game goes has level based zones.  So at the start you find a newby zone
appropriate for your level say, levels
1 to 3 and you continue to kill the same creatures over and over and over
and over and over and over and over and over and over til you ding to say
level 3 then you move onto the next zone, then you find a group or solo and
proceed to kill the same things over and over and over and over and over and
over and over and over and
over and over til you ding to say level 8, then you go to the next
appropriate zone, find a group and proceed to kill the same things from one
spot over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and
over and over and over and over,  this is the same for 60 levels.  I suggest
waiting for Star wars galaxies which is coming out soon, beta testing is
starting in a few months, and besides Everquest 2 is projected for release
next year.

Everquest is monotonous, as noted above

Find a spot and kill the same things over and over and over and over and
over and over and over is basically how Evercamp goes
