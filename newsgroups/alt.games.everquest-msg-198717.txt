The key to my satisfaction as a player in such a system would be (1)
"multi-class" characters should be able to be as effective overall as
specialists, and (2) changing your skills should be non-trivial as a
"mid level" (however that translates to the game system in question)
and a royal pita at "high level", and (3) there are many equivalent
paths to success in the game rather than one or a handful (obviously
(1) is part of this).  I have long been irritated by games that favor
a single strategy, many a board wargame found its way into the trash
after one of us in my old gaming group discovered a dominant strategy.
EQ suffers from this in spades, but so far the social aspect of the
game has kept me from quitting altogether.  It'd be truly incredible
if somebody managed to develop a game where there was interesting play
at the high end that not only didn't require armies of players but also
didn't give a large advantage to veterans of the army game.  That is,
let most/all of the rewards for "raiding" be far more valuable for doing
even tougher raids than they are for smaller scale (single group) play,
and vice-versa.  I just can't see any valid reason for a game to limit
the rewards for one set of players (non-raiders) to the scraps flung
from the banquet tables of another set of players (raiders).  And yes,
the analogy is flawed (as any analogy is), but it conveys the feel of
the high-end game in EQ reasonably accurately, imo.
