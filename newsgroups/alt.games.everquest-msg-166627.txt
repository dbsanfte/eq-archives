What you are describing with the Acrylia pieces is price supports,
only not by government but by market makers.  The reason price
supports are needed is because the value decreases due to infinite
supply.

I agree that player time is a resource, but realistically that too is
infinite.  You will always find someone willing to spend the time, if
not you or me then someone else, because of the model of the game.

Many of the items in Norrath are difficult to acquire and costly to
make, both of which are reflected in the current price.  But the
simple fact is that these can continue to be acquired and made for
eternity.  In 2 years Acrylia will be as common as Crafted armor is
now.  Which was a warriors dream when I started...
