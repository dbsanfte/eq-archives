Anyone notice when emotes had the "--" at the start taken out again?
A guildie of mine spoofed looting a Deepwater BP from a bodyguard in KC.  I
should have known better but I had gratzed him in the guild channel before
he (in between tears of laughter I imagine) /told me he was faking it.

I remember them changing it sometime last year...anyone know if they put it
back deliberately or is it a "fix".

Ah well

is gonna take all loot messages with a pinch of salt from now on.
