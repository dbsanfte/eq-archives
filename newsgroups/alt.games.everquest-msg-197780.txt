Or you are yet another victim of the "randomly interrupt any cast by
a character under level 20 for no apparent reason" bug.  I think it's
actually caused by "phantom" movements that are so tiny that they
never (or almost never) interrupt once your Channelling skill is over
100.  My latest baby Druid has been getting a lot of them recently,
for instance on Snares where the start of cast occurred over half-
second after the mob turned and started running, or on casts made
immediately after standing up.  For some reason it always seems to
happen on offensive spells, but that could just be perception.
