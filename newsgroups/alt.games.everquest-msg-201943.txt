It all depends on what guild, what class/level you are, and what time of 
the year it is. And where in the world the majority of the guild is based.

If youre a level 25 druid that join a guild that do the usual "/ooc 
GuildXXX recruiting, all levels and classes can apply" the guild is 
probably not in a stage to do a lot of stuff.
If the guild is some friends who have fun XPing together, there might be 
no raid activity at all. Or the guild could be one that dont have the 
numbers for raids (ok, can raid najena or the like, but stuff there is 
noo really upgrades any more) and instead do other fun activities not 
related to raiding.
The higher end guild can require 40+ hours of game time a week, and raid 
every day, so it all depend on what YOU wanna do, not on what guilds in 
general does.
My guild is euro based, and we raid 4+ times a week usually, but in 
summer we are lucky to have ONE raid a week, since people are on summer 
vacation (dont ask me why, but the 2 euro guilds on my server got NO 
members all summer, but all others play like mad, guess americans go no 
life :))

So you decide what YOu want in a guild. Do you wanna XP with some 
friends, have fun doing non-loot and non-XP stuff, or you wanna hardcore 
raid stuff? Find out what you want, and find a guild that fit that goal.
