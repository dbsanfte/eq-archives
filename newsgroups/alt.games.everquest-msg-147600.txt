Agreed.  Which to some degree validates VI not bringing the subject
up in-game.  I doubt that this newsgroup is truly representative of
the EQ playing populace (I think we're skewed towards older players,
for instance), let alone the populace in general.  But I expect the
"keep RL out of my fantasy world" attitude is pretty common amongst
EQ players in general.

I don't know anybody who watched it to bitch.  Those who wanted to
see it watched it, the rest of us found other things to do.
