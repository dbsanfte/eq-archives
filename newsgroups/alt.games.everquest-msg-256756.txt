It seems likely they will have localized versions of the game (they
do, after all, have localized web forums for it), so Germans will be
able to get either German voice acting or German text (don't know if
they've announced localized voice acting).  Assuming, of course,
they're willing to go to an all-German server...

I really hope they will have text, too, because it will be horribly
annoying to have to listen to the whole thing all over if you miss
some detail.  And if the voice acting is, as seems likely, atrocious,
I would prefer to be able to turn it off.  Not to mention how much
this drives up the cost of any expansion.

But who knows, I might be pleasantly surprised.
