I went from 4 to 8 solo. Gave away everything I made except kept a cracked
staff to beat on stuff with. Only had two level 4 spells in my book, Root
and Frost Bolt IIRC. From 8 on used Flame Bolt or Bolt of Fire or whatever
it is called to 12, seldom needed Root. At 12, think you get shock of
lightning which is a pretty good spell.

You are probably making a simple mistake, like closing with your quarry and
attacking melee then trying to get off spells during combat: Don't do that.

No joke, about 80% of the time you click your spell icon you should get
"That target is out of range" or you are doing something wrong. If something
ever gets close enough to you to hit you and it has over 50% of its hit
points remaining, you are doing something wrong. If you get [fizzle, fizzle,
resist] and the mob gets to you before you can retreat to the guards or
zone, you are doing something wrong.

Melee with a wizard is purely optional. Kind of like "Well, it only has
1/4th its life left, I have 50% mana and full health. I think I can get a
few spells off while it is clubing me vs turning it over to the guards."
