So this means that each time one of my alts took a port to Faydwer, I got a
member of the 1% who doesn't make assinine assumptions?  Goddamn!  I have to
have the best run of luck in the history of mankind.

I hope you are on Povar, Ben.  You port an alt of mine to BB when you said
you'd take me to GFay, and I will not pay you.  Then you'll waste your time
spreading the bad word on that char and I'll delete him and make another.
And do it again.

It reminds me of a cousin of mine here in Germany.  He orders chocolate ice
cream off the menu.  The waiter says nothing about it, but when it's time
for dessert, he brings vanilla ice cream.  My cousin, confrontational guy
that he is, raises holy hell.  He is then -- and only then -- told that they
are out of chocolate ice cream so they substituted without asking.  Do you
think he paid for it?  Would you?  If you would, you are a victim, and you
should plan on being taken advantage of often throughout your life.
