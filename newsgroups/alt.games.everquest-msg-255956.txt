I use a Reaver for killing things with, but recently picked up a Two 
Handed Practice Sword out of the discount bin at the Bazaar.

Using this means taking a hit to DPS, as its 19/47 instead of the 40/40 
I'm normally using.  Takes a while to proc, usually half a mob or so, 
when it does I put it away till DS fades.

Reading thru various commentary about how this effect sucks due to the 
duration, I have to think this is why it was so cheap, but the duration 
on it now is 15 minutes like the mage DS's, apparantly it got upgraded, 
or else these people have a very different idea than I do about what a 
"very short lived" buff is.

Anyway, assume I'm cutting my DS in half for half of one mob, but then 
adding 6 DS to all future hits for 15 minutes.  I'm thinking the average 
mob at my level is quadding me every 3 seconds, landing about 3 out of 
every 4 hits, so that averages out to one hit every second, or 6 DS 
damage to the mob every second; 6 DPS.

Sometimes I fight two mobs at once, in which case the DS usually has 
taken the add down to 80% by the time I've finished the first mob; this 
would imply that 6DPS is about 20% of my normal output.

Against the mob I'm actually fighting, I use stuns to take their DPS in 
half, so it will only add about 3DPS to my killing.  In groups where I'm 
not the MT it will add even less, only affecting the odd add here and 
there or the few times the mob turns on me or ripostes me; its probably 
not at all worth using in such an instance.
