No, re-read the post (that's why I didn't snip it).  I stated nothing about
numerical goals.  I stated that I wanted to spend time in a little escapist
fun with my RL buddies.

I never said it was the way to make all of them.  Look back .. I defy you
you to snip a quote from me where I said that all games should be like EQ.

What I am saying, though, is that I like the newer EQ better than I liked
the one I started playing in March 2001.

For the last time ... this is no longer an RPG.  I like the fantasy genre,
and here I can play spellcasters, etc. , interact with my friends online,
and not have to worry about getting ganked by twitch gamers (a-la Diablo).

The only time I can find immersion in a game is when playing single player
games, frankly.  Where no other living being can ruin it, and it's all about
the game itself.  And even at that, it takes a lot to get me immersed.  The
last game that accomplished it, I believe, was Civilization ... the original
Civilization.
