Well, there aren't that many low level dungeon zones after Kunark:
Velious is a 30+ expansion, Luclin has Paludal Caverns and Netherbian
Lair but other than that only outdoors or high level zones, PoP starts
at 46, LoY is for 30+, LDoN 20+ (so almost qualifies, but not quite),
GoD/OoW/DoN are for 40+ (and mostly 60+), DoDH is mostly 60+ except
monster missions.  I don't really know anything about Prophecy of Ro
or Serpent's Spine as I stopped playing after DoDH was released and
started again on Combine which only just got PoP and LDoN, but my
impression PoR is mostly 60+ with some monster missions and TSS
finally is the first expansion with any amount of low level content.

That's not to say you mightn't get the same result for higher levels,
of course, just that this sample isn't very fair to later expansions
since they didn't have zones designed for the high teens.
