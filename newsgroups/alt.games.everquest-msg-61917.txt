First try and find a necro who can and will cast summon corpse. 
Or try and get a levitate or similar and run around above the lava  until
you can get /corspe to work and run to the nearest safe spot. May get you
dying again though.

If these fail then its toime to Petition. As a lvl 24 ranger a GM did help
me but I had said what I had done to try and recover the body.
