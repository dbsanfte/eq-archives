Because bottom-posting caters to the rather common case of someone
who has already read the previous posts, but might not remember
exactly what was said.  E.g., if the thread has been going on a while,
you might've read all of it as of a day or so ago, and come back today
to find new comments added.  You really don't want to read ALL of the
content of whatever is being replied to, but you DO want a refresher
that tells you what part (or parts) the person is responding to.
