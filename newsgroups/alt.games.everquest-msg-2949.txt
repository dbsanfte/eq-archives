The other advice here is great, but I'll add a slightly different
angle.  An enchanter doing crowd control does well with a healer keeping
an eye on them.  And it helps if the enchanter doesn't try to be a
hero.  Adapt to your group, if they won't help then you will have to
change your tactics to stay alive.  

Here's an example: Puller brings 5 mobs, likely more than the enchanter
or cleric can survive hits from.  The enchanter does single mezzes.  If
some of the mezzes break that might mean 2 mobs on the enchanter.  Since
the enchanter is getting hit the cleric heals the chanter.  Now those
mobs are on the cleric.  So the enchanter mezzes them to save the
cleric's butt and all the mobs are now either mezzed or on the tanks. 
The cleric's first responsibility is to keep the chanter alive.  The
chanter's first responsibility is to keep mobs off the cleric.  If you
want to get really fancy, the cleric can mem their level 5 stun and use
it to give the chanter more time to mez.  Neither of those spells will
break the other.  When the tank is about ready to hit the next mob to
unmez it and start fighting, have them taunt before they hit, so the mob
doesn't jump the chanter.  

Ok, suppose that doesn't work because the cleric ignores you and lets
you die.  Change your tactics a bit more.  When the puller pulls, wait
for the tank to swing a couple times, then assist them and cast a long
stun.  Wait to cast mezzes until the cleric has healed the first time,
then use a mez followed by a mem blur.  That may not be as efficient,
but should keep the mobs off you completely and keep you alive.

Me too.  Either get in a good group that will keep you alive or adapt to
your group, and you'll keep on loving your enchanter.
