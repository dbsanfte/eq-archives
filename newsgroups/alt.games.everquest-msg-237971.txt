http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0534561721/qid=1078245847/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/104-3709897-8584701?v=glance&s=books

	That's a fairly easy introductory text on the subject.

	Propositional logic uses symbols to represent entire sentences, or
propositions.  It it very limited in power.  For instance you can't properly
represent "all humans are mortal/Socrates is human/.:Socrates is mortal" in
propositional logic, because it has no way to represent Socrates as having the
quality of humanity (or mortality).

	I've never heard of "first order sentential logic"...I think you mean
first order predicate logic, which deals with qualities.  (Second order deals
with qualities of qualities, and gets very ugly very fast.)  Ax:H(x)->M(x)/
Es:H(s)/H(s)->M(s)/.:M(s) is the above syllogism in predicate logic, though
the "A" is supposed to be upside-down and the "E" backwards.  First order
predicate logic is still not powerful enough to succumb to Godel's
Incompleteness Theorems; in fact, IIRC, Godel himself proved it consistent and
complete.  A system has to be powerful enough to represent integer math before
getting nailed.
