This isn't in reply to the above post, but it is about the attacks.  I
didn't feel it was important enough to merit its own thread and this is as
good a place to put it as any.  It's a small thing on one hand, but somehow
it makes me even angrier than the terrorist attacks.

Friday, there was a big thing in my area about setting up vigil with
candles.  We put one outside where I work, and it was stolen.
****STOLEN!!!****  I can believe terrorists, even ones as extreme as we just
had.  But this I can't believe.  What kind of useless, vile, moronic,
treacherous, malicious, contemptible, snot-spewing, egg-sucking,
shit-eating, callous, limp-wristed, rotten, shameless, despicable,
dick-sucking, low-down, sorry-assed excuse for a bloated sack of
filth-ridden protoplasm would STEAL a vigil candle?  Whoever he is, I wish
him a protracted, agonizing death at the hands of some incurable,
disfiguring disease, and afterwards, I wish his screaming, black, shriveled
little soul to be speared onto hell's great shish kabob skewer right between
those of the terrorists.

D, who feels a LITTLE better now, and wishes he really believed in hell
