That's why I said "on 100% AA exp".  I've got considerably more played time
overall.  =)

15 minute-per-mob-kill kite is 6% AA every 15 minutes.  1 AA per 4 hours. 
No, not fantastic.  Most rangers I know team up with one other ranged-damage
person to speed that up.  Not quite "soloing", but still the same concept. 
Ask me how many AAs I can solo in 4 hours with my monk.   =)

Rangers are at the bottom of the "decent soloers" list.  Bards are at the
top.  They all work on the concept of doing damage without taking damage,
which is what is required to solo grind AAs at 65.
