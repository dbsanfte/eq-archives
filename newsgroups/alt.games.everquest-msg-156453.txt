You dont have to group. Druids can solo all the way to 60 easily, but being
in a group can be a lot more fun. You could probably find a group in oasis
(2 zones south of freeport), or at a dervish camp in north ro (1 zone south
of freeport). Get a bind at the soulbinder in east freeport first.
If it were I, then id probably head over to east karana and kill wolves and
stuff soloing, but thats just me, I lik getting away from the masses.
Not sure if will-o-wisps are still blue at 12. You can hunt them in commons,
and they are pretty easy and good loot for their level. You need a magic
weapon for them tho.
