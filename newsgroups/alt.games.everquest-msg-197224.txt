Hi all,

Well, I'm newby, my husband is not newby like me, but not at home when I am.
I just started a Wizard Erudit, and with fews advisories I am now level 10.
But I need more advisories from other wizard, and where to find equipment at
cheap price to start.
I done this char because I like it, not because of powerfull objectif, and I
put bonus points ramdomly in stats, as in all RPG.  But inlikely, ERU
haven't infrafiion :-( and I don't see in the dark. Do you know equipment
could give me this ability ?
And could you explain me important skills to train, and lots of others
important things to know ?
Don't be afraid to contact me in game too.

Thx

Elhea
ERU WIZ lvl10
