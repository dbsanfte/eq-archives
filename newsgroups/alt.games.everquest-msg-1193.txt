I dunno fer sure, but this I do know: Last night I tried to zone in to
Kael Drakkal, and I zonecrashed back to the Server Selection screen.
Thereafter, attempting to log in with that character booted me back to
the Server Selection screen every time.  I could log in with any other
character but that one.  I also tried logging in on my other computer;
same result.  Re-downloading the zone files for Kael didn't help.
GM's couldn't help, they said, "They're probably working on it."  I
spent some time in the CHAT area, and "listened" to multitudes of
other players with the same problem with other zones such as South
Karana and the DreadLands.  Shortly thereafter, Test went down for
awhile.  This morning, I downloaded today's patch, and now I can log
in.

I am just ever-so-slightly suspicious that this Future Artwork patch
wasn't tested thoroughly...
