I'd like to see EQ Wizards be a little more like D&D Wizards.  In D&D,
there's nothing inherently wrong with a Wizard taking up a weapon, other
than Wizards and Sorcerers are on the worst attack table in the game.  At
level 20, Wizard/Sorcerer Base Attack Bonus is +10, whereas
Fighter/Barbarian/Paladin/Ranger would be at +20, and
Cleric/Druid/Rogue/Bard would be at +15 (I forget where Monks would be).

Wizard/Sorcer have lousy HP, and avoid armor (unlike in EQ, a D&D Wizard
*could* wear plate, but it would give him a 40% chance of failure on spells
because of the restricted movement, so it would probably not be a good
idea), so don't want to get beat on, so generally won't take up the sword,
but taking up the crossbow makes a lot of sense, and it is not at all
uncommon for a D&D Wizard to plunk the monsters with crossbow bolts or
arrows, saving their magic for the really tough fights.
