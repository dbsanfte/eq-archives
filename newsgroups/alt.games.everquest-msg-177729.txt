I agree.  Way too many groups think that their sheer *numbers* give them the
right to an area.  Huge vent:
My wizard friend and I will spend half an hour breaking up the elites / oracle
(dark blue) at the rygorr fort.  We'll be tooling along, minding our own
business, pulling our mobs out of the fort and killing them without causing any
problems.  Along comes some freakin group and they'll trot right in and plop
their fat butts INSIDE THE ORACLE ROOM!  Without saying a word, no greeting,
nothing.
Hello???? We TOTALLY agree with sharing a camp, no problem.  One guy sent me a
tell, "no worries, we're only after the elites".  Huh?  What, you think we are
here to enjoy the scenery?????  
Inevitably, these jojos have no clue what they are doing and the next thing you
know they are "/ooc looking for 4 rezzes at rygor fort".  Well DUH you idiots!
The only thing that's worse is the kiters.  No, not druids, they have brains. 
Almost ALWAYS it's a bard that can't handle his kites.   These would be the
guys that assure us that they know what they are doing.  Right before the
elites and oracle all drop on our heads.  Then they spend the next 20 minutes
saying it surely wasn't "their" mistake.  
Ok, it's 3 in the morning and there are only 3 players on track.  But it
*couldn't* be his bad pull that got 20 rygors running around out front in a
rage.  Probably the cold made them mad.  Yeah, that's got to be it.
Ok.  I'm done venting.
