Yes everyone would like more spell slots but then when is enough 10, 15, 20
every spell in the book. There has to be a cutoff point 8 spells make you
think a little bit on what you need. Just taking a wild guess your a Druid
who solos. Also the 10 macro slots are there weither you are in full screen
or not just have to goto Full Screen to insert them.
