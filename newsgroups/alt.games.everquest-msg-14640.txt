Yes. Evils have enourmous advantages because EQ is very poorly designed for
PvP play.

>2. How balanced are the classes in PvP? 

Not even remotely. EQ is very poorly designed for PvP play. Necromancers,
clerics, bards, shamans, and enchanters are Death Incarnate in PvP. The
other classes just try and stay out of the way of the titans. Or gank them.

Resists are also king. The blue diamonds that sell for 3k on a blue server
sell for 15k+ on a Zek. More if you are on a different team.

>3. At what level are you generally safe from the "Grief" players? (I
>realize you are never completely safe.)

1-5, before the ability to PK kicks in. After that you are fair game. Even
worse with the new server rules, which are truely horrible, even by most
PvP standards (which are pretty bad). If you are going to start there,
start there NOW, so that you don't have the high level ganking that will be
taking place once people get high enough to do it.
