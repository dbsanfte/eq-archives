Well, I was talking about for a full group.  Easy LDoNs are quite 
trivial, and do not require any more healing than one shaman, with even a 
ranger tanking.  I know because I've done it.  Mind you, the ranger was 
rather well equipped, but substitute in a tank class with lesser 
equipment for similar results.  I do have to admit that I have not done 
any LDoNs since level 65, and I understand that the level 70 LDoN is a 65 
hard, which, at least at level 65, was difficult, but doable, back before 
OOW/DoN equipment, when I was equipped with a mixture of Ssra and PoP 
pre-elemental gear.
