I'd say this is absolutely untrue and takes quite a bit fun out of any
encounter. I did not realize this until I chatted with friends from my
old guild and they told me how the enjoyed our tries at Shei Vinitras
then. I was raidleader and surely I did research everything I could. But
since we only had about 25-30 people everytime we could not burn him
down like the bigger guilds did. And we really had a hard time learning
the script(the 4 adds at the beginning of the script gave us headache).

But my point is even though I DID think they get tired of wipe after
wipe I often was asked to schedule another Shei raid just for the fun of
learning this encounter. So I believe raiding would be much more fun
when people ignore these spoilers and start working on their own
strategy as spoilers really aren't necessary.
