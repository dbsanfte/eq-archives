Ummm... I don't have Velious yet but... one thing I do see that no-one's
mentioned yet is if you log all the way in and get to (I think) the server
selection screen, there is a button to "Register Velious".  Try regging it
first, log out, and then see if a "Velious Patch" button shows up on the
little gray box when you first start up EQ.

LOL, I see that Register Velious button every day and grit my teeth cause
the CD hasn't arrived yet, so I know it's there.  :)
