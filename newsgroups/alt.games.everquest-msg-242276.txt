Ummm, it's never been against offical policy for GM's to conduct gay 
marriage. After all, there's no way for them to know the real gender of 
your avatar's player, is there? The willngness to conduct wedding 
ceremonies has always been up to the individual GM or Guide.

Concerning Pink, yeah, my guild was blaming my foul comments on the vile 
Colour on the emergency patch.
