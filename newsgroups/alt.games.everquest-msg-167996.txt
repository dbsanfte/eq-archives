Way back when I last looked, there was a PPC emulator as part of the
Development kit for either embedded C or VB.  I think those are still
free...

The PPC game is pretty fun.  Plays (and looks, for that matter) a wee
bit more like Diablo of old, but you'll recognize many of the zones.
I've not gotten too deep into it, but the bits I've seen I like.  Some
interesting tweaks on game play as well.  For instance, the warrior
bash kick and more advanced skills actually take mana...  In the
context, I kind of like it.
