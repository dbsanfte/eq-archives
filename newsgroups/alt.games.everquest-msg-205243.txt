 I'm sure this has been asked before but I have a 60 warrior that's been
putting 100% into AA forever. I keep having people telling me to level
because it'll help me take hits and reduce agro. I can see reducing agro but
how else can leveling warrior help? Your skills are maxed at 60 and you only
move up just minor hp's a level. Is there something I'm missing here? Just
to let you know I play in old worlds alot, rarely in PoP if this makes a
huge difference.
 Thanks for any input on this.
