My new home is now Stone Brunt as is very ranger frendly for my level! I
have also farmed about 10 waks here and there (yet to get a buyer) and I
always keep an eye on track for 'a heretic invader', but i've been in SB for
the last 3 levels and have only seen and killed one. As you may be aware you
need 4 heads for that haste quest, and with my track maxxed out (170) you
would of thought I would spot them.
I tend to play when most Americans are still in bed (the afternoon/early
evenings GMT) So the zone never has more than 3-4 players in it, and from
various /ooc's they are after titans (which i gladly track for them) or just
after a quiet zone in there mid 20's for some kobold hunting far away from
the ill omen and oasis :)

So any one have any ideas/suggestions as to where to find them, or how to
get them to pop. I hunt around the bowl area, which is right near the far
east zone wall, quite close to the zone entrance that is filled in (whats
that going to be i wonder).

Once again, thanks in advance!
