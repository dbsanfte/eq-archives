OK, here is a quote:

---->Now, quit being fucking patronizing asshole and tell me where I
didn't read the subject line.

Hmmm, rude, and blaming someone else for your rudeness.  Yes, you did
read it, but I guess you didn't understand it.  Your response was,
hmm, shall we say, rather out of line with the rest of the thread.

Of course there is always this:

----->You STILL haven't told me where I have "not read" the subject
line.  Instead you sit here and play "high and mighty" talking down to
me off a fucking high horse and flinging petty insults.

Hmmm, looks to me EXACTLY like you're blaming someone else for your
own ignorance.  Trying to get the conversation on their errors,
especially funny when the comment that led to you going all fuckwilly
was about as innocuous as can be.

So yes, you are an idiot DT, you were wrong, you passed bad
information that indicates that you are not very well informed on a
variety of EQ issues, but instead of doing the right thing and saying,
"Well how about that, guess I was mistaken, my bad." and letting it
pass, you prefer to smear shit all over yourself, roll around in your
own vomit, and then whine when nobody wants to hug you.
