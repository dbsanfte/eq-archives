    I play on a 33,6 modem and it's only slightly crappier than my old 512k
dsl connection. So long as nobody else decides to download (4 seconds of lag
can really muck up your fear kiting) the difference, except for zoning, is
barely noticeable.

    Oh yeah, except that the isp drops me every 5 hours. That blows goats.
