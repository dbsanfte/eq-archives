I agree with it. Look at it this way:

If 99 of 100 players powerlevel to the max level, who does that
leftover 1 player play with?
If 99 of 100 players don't powerlevel (and are thereby playing low
level characters), who does that leftover 1 player play with?

If high level characters are able to continually inject more and more
powerful items into the economy, the value of the becomes devalued.
(For example, tradeskill armor was once useful to make and sell.) Even
with level restrictions this will become a problem - people with the
cash for the higher level items can simply purchase and xp grind rather
than seek out armor upgrades in the rest of the game. That's primarily
an economy problem but is certainly exacerbated by a powerleveling
ability.

In EQ1, there were many good reasons for powerlevelling, but it
certainly has had an imbalancing snowball effect - to the point that
many people considered powerlevelling necessary for their new
characters. It drastically changes the focus of the game. (It also
often devalued the powerlevelled character, as I witnessed many people
quickly abandon their boosted twinks.)
