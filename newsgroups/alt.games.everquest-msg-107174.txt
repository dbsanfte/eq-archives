*sigh* i remember the good ole days when you could get upset with someone
for wanting SoW for free. Lets face it, if you are level 14, 2-3SoW is a
significant amount of mana.

Now, people wander up and want Group SLN(700 mana) Group regen(400 mana)
Ports (300 mana) they just want everything. When I don't want to give it to
them, I don't.

I am (almost) NEVER anon or /role. I like being in CS and being the ONLY
person who isn't anon with 10 other people in the zone :)

Also, I have mentioned this before. Kiss up to me and roleplay and I will
99% of the time grant your request.

Merciful Guardian of Karana's plains... will you bestow upon us the blessing
of Karana's Spirit of Wolf?

Gets you a lot farther with me than
