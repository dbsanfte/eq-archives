been playing about the same time, lot's of various characters which all have
one thing in common: lack of ports (until now) and soloing so running all
over the place on foot and I have seen it quite a few times just passing
through SK.

I haven't actually stopped and hunted much at all in SK - just travelling
through too. Then again, the timezone I play from and there would rarely
have been enough people in any single one of the Karana's to make up a
single full group.
