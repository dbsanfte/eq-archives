    I've seen the female Teir'Dal helmet live (makes you look like you're
shot out of cannons for a living), and a few others that I cannot remember.
What I have yet to see is the one I'd get, the dwarven female one. That one
looks like a silver skullcap with curling ram's horns on either side (not
asymmetric like the dwarf male helm), and I'd LOVE to have one. I could be a
battering cleric!
