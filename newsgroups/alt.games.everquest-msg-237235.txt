You'll note i explicitly noted that these 'other pursuits' can be
subservient to hedonism. However, I am not so cynical as to beleive
that a father of 3 who sacrifices his life to try to save a stranger
has in fact maximized his pleasure in accordance with a hedonistic fit
of satisfaction in performing the deed. I am confident there was a
great deal more pleasure to be had from choosing to live then in
losing his life to the mere attempt at saving someone elses.

Hedonism may be *a* highest pursuit, but not *the* highest pursuit to
all.
