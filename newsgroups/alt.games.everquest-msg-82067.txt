Well, while I am not on your server, I can tell you that if its like my
server, the chances are very slim.

Rarely (And I do mean Rarely) do I ever see them for sale, and I am always
keeping an Eye out. The few times I have seen them, they go for 14Kpp to
15Kpp. As dumb as it may sound, it would actually be possible to buy a Full
set of JB Gear (Minus the bracer) without ever seeing a JBB for sale.

As far as raising money, I tend to hunt at odd times. Generally speaking, at
3 in the morning, there is not much contesting over spawns. A week or two in
Rathe Mountains hunting HG will get you the money you need, should you be
able to find a bracer for sale.

A JBB Is ideal for a Solo Shaman. I am now lvl 51 and have been looking for
one since lvl 40 or so. In that time, I have seen "Maybe" 3 for sale and I
always seemed to be short of cash when they were being sold.

From one Shaman to another, I wish you luck
