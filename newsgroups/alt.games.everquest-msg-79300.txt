One might disagree with the term "intended."  They're certainly playing the
game AS IT'S WRITTEN, but I'd be willing to bet you $50 that the designers
didn't say "let's write the game so that hard working druids can sit at the
Kaladim docks and kill dwarves for hours on end."

I agree that it's stupid to violate TOS when dealing with losers, though.
