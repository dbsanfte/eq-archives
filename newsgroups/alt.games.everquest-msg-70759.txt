Ouch.
I died 6 times between levels 33 and 50. Pretty much all my deaths
since then (11) have been raid induced, except for a small fall in
Velk's that hit me for 10k, and an incident the other night when the
warrior pulling to my Velk's floor group apparently aggroed something
high up, leading to me being summoned and beaten up by an Icepaw
champion and a crystalline gargoyle after I healed the warrior. 
(Of course, this was the one night I didn't have gate memmed, but I
doubt I would have gotten it off anyway; was kinda slippery up there)
