This annoncement ties in very nicely with the discussion we've been having here
recently regarding the whole "soloing vs. groupie" debate.  For those of you
who espoused the opinion that it was always fair either way, or even slanted
towards solos, and the Verant had no vested interest in upsetting the balance
either way, I think the following short paragraph will put that issue to rest
nicely.
***********************
Grouping Bonus
We've always been the first to say that EverQuest is designed to promote
grouping.
Those who prefer to solo should be able to do so with some restrictions, but
probably will not be able to go everywhere and do everything like a well-oiled,
or like multiple well-oiled groups. This is a main foundation of EverQuest, and
is what drove our decision to implement a class-based system where classes have
strengths and weaknesses that complement each other.
************
Enough said? The system was initially set up to be to the detriment of those
who wished to pursue the challenges of soloing over the safety of grouping, and
this change is only going to increase the chasm between the two styles of
playing. Ah well, I have a little 3 person group I can get with pretty much at
will to keep my grouping skills in shape. I guess we'll at least get *some* of
the bonus treasure trove being handed out to the groupies.
