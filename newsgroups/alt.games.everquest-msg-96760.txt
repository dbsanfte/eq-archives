My highest is a Half-Elf Druid.  He is one of my first characters, and at
creation, I didn't know about the whole WIS in relation to Mana/Medding
thing.  This isn't a complaint, because I love my little Druid, but here's
the question.

Do attributes like WIS, INT, etc increase by leveling, or only by stat
equipment?  Druid is currently at 104 WIS, and having a devil of a time
finding plausible solutions to increase his WIS.

May be a silly question, but I had to ask.

Thank You,
