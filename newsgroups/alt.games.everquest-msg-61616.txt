Transfering accounts everything stays with character Transfering servers =
you lose everything.

  "Varjay" <varjay@subdimension.com> wrote in message =
news:AIzM7.19$6T3.2572@newsfeed.slurp.net...
  I was wondering if it was possible to transfer a character from one =
account to another....

  I am about to sign up for a 2nd EQ account and possibly get a 2nd =
computer and was wanting to have a character already on that account....

  is it possible?

  And if so, what is transfered and what isn't?  no-drop stuff?


  Thanks in advance....

  Vj
