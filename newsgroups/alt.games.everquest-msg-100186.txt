What do you guys think about a Guild of Group epic adventures.  I
would really like to see some over time adventures.

This is my brief idea of what I mean.



When you zone in you are in there for a month (RL).  No way to get out
unless you get to the end of the quest.  Not even death will let you
out.  It starts out easy even has place for a bank  at the start but
no supplies. You want arrows, food or other stuff? Make it, forage or
what ever.    Battles would be large and deadly, advanced scouting
necessary, AE necessary every tactic conceivable.  You would meet up
against hidden Rangers, Wizards and Dragon fly over during your
journey (random).  There would be some safe areas to camp, heal, bind
and get your thoughts together but no pulling to that spot and you
must spend 3~8 EQ hours there once you enter.

Reoccurring random God encounters and only the slightest chance of
getting new equip until the final epic battle (they have more than
enough equipment now).  If they do no complete the quest in a given
time frame they get cast out to start over again.  Once they complete
the quest 3 times do not let them do it again.

The reoccurring God encounters are just to smash the group, slow them
down, curse a few players with a disease for 10 eq days and/or send a
few back to the last safe zone after days of adventuring.  The amount
sent back will not be able to get to the others and the ones left
might not have enough of a certain class to move on.  Ofcourse you
could always gate back to the last safe zone.

This removes the Ubers from the normal game giving the lessers a
chance to have some fun for a while and gives the Ubers a real test of
there so-called powers.  No need to retune the old-world because the
big players are gone or minimized.  The Ubers are off on their
greatest adventure ever.  

Some Guilds have almost a hundred 60 levels.  Pack them up and move
out because when it is all said and done only a handful will make it
to the end.
