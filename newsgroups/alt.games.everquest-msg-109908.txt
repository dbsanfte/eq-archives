New patch message

PATCH MESSAGE, APRIL 24, 2002 
April 23rd, 3:00am 

NOTE: We are unable to patch "code" right now because we are in the
middle of making some changes to the basic structure of the game. This
will delay fixes for system bugs and updates (such as Alternate
Advancement Abilities and /commands). Please be patient until we can
get these much-needed changes finished. Because these changes affect
things such as the database that stores player characters, we're
taking care to make these changes the right way. 

Items

Faun hooves are now stackable 
Storm Reaper Initiate Scimitar is now magic 
Moss Toe Bracer is no longer Lore 
Bracer of the Stoutdeacon is no longer Lore 
Infected Rat Livers are no longer No-Drop 
Shadowsong Cloak now also grants a hit point bonus 
Sambata Boulder now has a range value and can be thrown 
Spear of Foresight no longer has a range value (it is primary hand
only) 
Rod of Identification now has 20 charges 
Patriarch Claws can now be used by Beastlords 
Crystalline Silk Threads are now stackable. 
Spells

Casters of slow spells recently given a disease component (such as
Shiftless Deeds and Turgur's Insects) should no longer attract undue
attention to themselves. 
Raised the price to purchase Phantom Plate scroll to be more in line
with others of that spell line 
The following Spells are now usable by Beastlords: Serpent Sight(19),
Enduring Breath(29), Levitate(39) and Talisman of Tnarg(53) 
Changed the way Circle of Summer stacks with other spells 
Changed Torrent of Fatigue so that it actually replenishes stamina for
the caster instead of taking it away 
Cure Blindness should work now 
Changed Koadic's Heightened Focus to better stack with other mana
regeneration spells 
Trade Skills 
Cazic Thule tradeskill items are no longer No Drop 
Quests

Halfling Toes should now be available 
The Dark Elven Cleric Guild Summons should show the proper text now 
The Dark Elf Wizard Guild Summons should show the proper text now 
Unholy Silk Bracer recipe should be correct now  


Quindell 52 High Elf   Cleric <Dark Brigade>
Yute      27 Dwarven   Rogue  <Legion of Quellious>
Fulcon   25 Wood Elf   Druid  <Legion of Quellious>
Yizzan   20 Eurdite     Necro
Beltain  11 Barbarian  Shamman <Legion of Quellious>

            Quellious

the shoulder blades will seriously cramp his style"
