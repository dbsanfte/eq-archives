Mezmerization is level 16 I'm afraid, so he's going to have to do it the
hard way. The formerly research only spells that are sold in Katta are those
for levels 34 through 44, chanter, mage, and wizzy classes only. You're
still stuck researching the ones below and above those, and doing all the
research if you are a necro. /sigh  Here's hoping someone finds an evil
guild somewhere with the 34 through 44 necro research spells. Katta is such
a gothic place that it wouldn't surprise me if there was one undiscovered
somewhere in it. . .  =P
