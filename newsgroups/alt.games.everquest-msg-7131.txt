I,m a new, 3 Mo, player, but fairly old in life, 54yrs, and am rather
surprised at the level of passion and thought that is going into a
game. Althought, I have to admit, a rather compelling game. That being
said here is my two cents, It seems that the game designers have left
many routes open in this FANTASY world for players to move through. If
one choses a route that involves groups banding togeather to help each
other advance, while others chose to go it alone or in small groups or
"families" that is their choice. Neither is "bad" and neither is
"cheating" it is just different. 

   Oh, are there many other "Old Pharts" like myself and my wife
playing this Game????
