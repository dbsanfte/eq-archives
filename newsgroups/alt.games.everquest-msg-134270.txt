We had a full group until right before we took off. Frankly, by that
point, I was in brain meltdown and wouldn't have noticed if I didn't
even get one. Which, in fact, I might not have. If it was the shammy,
that might explain how he didn't notice I was screwing up and taking him
to nearly certain death. 
;-)

Previous attempts to run from zone in to the SS with invis on my warrior
avoiding aggro have always been so spectacularly unsuccessful I don't
give much thought to invis in Hate.

/sigh

I've had more than a few rezzes up there.
