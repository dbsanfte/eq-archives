I've recently done well with drops and raising funds and went on a
tear to upgrade my cleric.  His AC was dismal, so that was my primary
focus.  Wis is now no longer 255, but after reading some of the other
recent cleric threads, not sure that's a big deal right now.  Mana
pool with epic equipped is over 3300 and I'm usually grouped with a 60
chanter.  Is that a decent mana pool for my level?  I do have the Ob
Shroud for mana preservation and the FT 1 solstice earring plus I'm
led to believe that BAotR has a mana regen component (?).

But now I'm not sure what I should focus on.  Pretty happy with my AC
for the moment:  1128 self buffed and defense (190)  [yes, I'm still
working on raising that by soloing off hours].

here's my magelo link:

Any suggestions on what next to focus on?  My resists aren't real
keen, so I know I have some work there (oh, and bottom bag on the left
does have some swapout resist items that I lug around).

Thanks for any advice or thoughts,
