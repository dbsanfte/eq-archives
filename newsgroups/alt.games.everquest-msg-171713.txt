Really?  I coulda sworn he said "add one level of rogue".  :-p

I'm sorry it offended you that I moved on to describe the advantages of
a "fairly even split" after agreeing with him.  And then pointed out how
the UMD skill is easily controlled (or "balanced" if you prefer) in an
intelligently designed server valut campaign.  Again I apologise, after
reading your many posts that rival mine for "ramblingness" it simply
didn't occur to me that you wouldn't be able to keep up.
