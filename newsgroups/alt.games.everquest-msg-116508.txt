You're exagerrating a bit here Dennis.  Certainly for a warrior who
can't afford to drop 2k on a pulling tool, or a younger ranger who
simply cannot afford better, the Runed Oak Bow would be worth 200 - 400
easily.  Also, for those of us who have been playing for years and
yet are still scraping for the platinum to buy better gear for our
mains, the Runed Oak can be a nice affordable upgrade for an alt.
