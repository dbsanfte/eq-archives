I didn't say that. I said your account was worthless. This isn't a dick 
waving contest its just a fact.

Your trying to unload something that is worthless against the rules. If 
someone is going to gamble on all the issues that come with taking on a 
used account the account should at least have value.

Yeah, honest people with integrity are ruining the game. Keep trying.

Your not winning any prizes yourself.

Who exactly do you see wanting a 53rd level bard enough to be willing to 
risk problems with soe over it, -and- willing to deal with your charming 
self to get it?

The sooner you stop coming back the sooner we can forget you.
