I will go with Star Wars being "just" an action/adventure movie (one of
the best).

My problem with the Matrix, which is otherwise a very good film, is that
it suffers from the "One Huge Plot Flaw" problem. I don't mind the leap
of faith that makes the whole world a virtual reality. I don't even mind
the internal inconsistancies. I can even belive that Kianoo (SP) is the
"Chosen one", but having us believe that the super computers that took
over the world can't find better batteries than humans is a bit daft.

It also begs the question do ginger people last twice as long ?
