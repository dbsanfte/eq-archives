I'll do some parsing for you.

Which mobs/zone/parsing program?  So we can be as sure as possible of their
accuracy?

150dps = not true.. not even possible for him

Thinking about it more now, I'd probably change that to 120ish, I used my
last parses to give the 100answer, which since then I've got Veng3, Wu's
(maybe new guild spells too, not sure)

I saw a monks parsed log of Garns (Vulak loot) + GMU at 114 DPS in WL in
early luclin

You can double that nowadays.

When you asked me, I was with a guildie ranger and was asking his opinion on
what xxx_class DPS currently was achieving (all have high-end weapons.. at
the very minimum, a Tunare poker)   His estimates were -
rogue: 125
ranger(archery): 120
me: 100
warrior(with bloodfrenzy/BoC/HG/emp sword combo etc): 80
ranger(melee): 70
warrior(regular weaps): 65

These were estimates, and they were all examples for specific guildies
(level 65, various AA's such as eq/am3, ambidex etc) so weapons, levels and
gear can change it.. but Id tend to go with his numbers more or less too

Including DS in the logging?

If a melee has a DS and then logs/parses the outcome, the DS will effect the
DPS figure (in most cases quite massively).

I remember one day I tanked King Tormax and parsed it, even though I was
stunned about 1/4 of the whole time, I came out at 190 DPS.   Im willing to
bet 70% of that was the DS damage :)

I've never seen an accurate way of logging somebody elses damage

I remember one time on Sont, a warrior logged everybodies damage and posted
it.. I came out at like 3000 damage, the other monks the same.. rogues
4000.. the warrior logging it all - 7000 damage and number 1 spot.. yeah
right heh
