pathetic would not be how I would describe him. He significantly reduced our
safety by allowing china to buy missle technology. He significantly reduced
our safety by ignoring bin laden when he was offered up by Sudan. He bungled
badly on Iraq and North Korea. He drove a robust economy into recession. Oh
and on the character issue he was disbarred for lying under oath and there
are credible reports that he is a rapist. He walks the street as a free man
and still enjoys the adulation of many. Nope pathetic dosent really describe
him well.
