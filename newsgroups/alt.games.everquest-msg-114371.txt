Sounds to me that you don't understand the offside rule (which is
understandable as it is tricky). The purpose of the offside rule is to
prevent a striker "goal hanging", as the ball can not be played forward when
an attacking player is behind the defence. If the rule didn''t exist a
skilled player could lob the ball over the defence to the striker given the
striker a one on one against the keeper. Without the rule the only way to
get a one-on-one with the keeper is to actually weave your way through the
defence which generally requires great skill, fast speed and teamwork. I
don't know much about American football but I assume that there would be
some mechanism in place to stop players from staying in a forward position
of the opposition just waiting for their team mates to throw them the bull
and allow them to cross the line. Rugby doesn't need such a rule because you
aren't allowed to throw forward from what I remember.
