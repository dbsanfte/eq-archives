Highest I know of is a
level 65 with 
FT 15 and Emperor Robe

20 mana per tick from medding
1  base mana per tick 
3  bonus mana per tick from being 65
3  from MC3 (aa)
5  Emperor robe
15 FT15
9  Spiritual Domination
9  Protection of the 9
18 VoQ
6  Mod rod charge every 5 min (as
long as you're not the mage summoning 
them)

If my math is right - that's 89 per tick.

Now, if we're talking a mage - this goes
up rather dramatically.

Sit him on horseback so he can get all
his meditation mana - then

SCM3, Specialization Conjuration, QS3,
Summoning Efficiency 3.

Now - I regenned 2700 mana in 32 ticks
with 17 pet reclaims - standing with
no mana buffs (base 1 mana per tick) -
calculation says 155+ mana per reclaim.
I don't have SCM 3 - that'll net you
another 20 mana per reclaim.  So our
65 mage with the above AA gets 175 mana
per 49 earth pet.  He summons one in
5 seconds - insta reclaim, 2 second recast.

So, his extra mana per tick is 175*6/7
or 150 per tick.  So our mage hits
150 + 89 or 239 per tick.  If he has
Rathe's son, Gloves of Dark summoning
(VT drop) this goes even higher (how
much I'm not sure, as I don't know the
focused HP on 65 earth pet).

Still 239 is pretty good :)

even without all that I hit 130 per
tick (barely any aa's, KEI, PoT9,
reclaiming a pet every 11 seconds).
