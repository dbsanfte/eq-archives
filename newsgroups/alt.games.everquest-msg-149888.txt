3 Pickled Froglok + 10gp to Chef Dooga in Oggok ->
    + clurg, +craknek warriors, +greenblood knights, +oggok guard
Can do this at dubious, but the chef stands very close to clurg,
so if you're kos to clurg you probably won't be able to do it.

High elf or human meat(?) to Chef Dooga in Oggok ->
    + clurg, +craknek warriors, +greenblood knights, +oggok guard
Dooga will give me the quest at dubious, but those annoying human
and elf dudes in Innothule are too tough for me. For now...

4 Lizard Tails to Grevak in SK guild in Oggok ->
    + clurg, +greenblood knights, -shadowknights of nightkeep
Can do this at dubious, but hoses your troll sk faction,
which may or may not be a big deal to you.

You could check allakhazam/illia's for more faction stuff.

Was kind of surprised that my Ogre SK was KOS a few places in Grobb,
but my Troll beastlord was nonKOS everywhere in Oggok...
