Yup, pretty much.

However, its not entirely unrealistic either. if you look at it on an 
emulation of national scale. Where each 'mob' is actually a village or 
town. The farthest out would be the weakest, while as you approached the 
capital the defenses and combat capabilities increase.

EQ however, just doesn't have the scale and volume of mobs to acheive 
that. Because yes, individually each town and outpost, would have the 
toughest defenses gaurding the weaker interior... but overall the remote 
towns will be able to muster far less combat capability than the capital 
city.

If you view each mob in eq as a representation of an entire town, then 
it works out much more realistically. And its not a completely 
out-to-lunch interpretation... after all ... surely the Blackburrow Clan 
of Gnolls numbers more than in the dozens.... otherwise I personally 
would have made them extinct many times over by now :)
