Definitely do the staff of temperate flux quest, instant clickable 8 FR/CR
debuff is excellent for pulling.  You've already got the best twink gear for
him, jboots.  Those and the staff are really all you need, anything else
just provides a buffer zone for borderline fights.  Although getting saves
up is always useful.

Mana is generally better than int at that level for the most part (1 int = 5
mana), although getting enough int to pass the 200 barrier means that 1 int
(over 200) = 5.8 mana at ANY level.  Oh, this is assuming the mana/int
formula is mana = int*(level/5), if it's not that then ignore this
paragraph.

For the crap slots, crystalline silk (raw silk + MR and maybe 1 more ac) at
the minimum (tailored with silk from Crystal Caverns or Velks, trivial
around 130 or so), or some more loam encrusted or netted kelp is a good
general choice, or ice silk if you're feeling particularly masochistic today
(tailored with silk from Ice Burrowers in West Wastes, trivial over 250).
Although this stuff doesn't come in earring flavor, so grab an Obsidian bead
hoop from Sol A or the batskulls like you said (or if in masochistic mood,
BD earring)

My necro's stuff is listed at
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=101720 he's kind of my caster
crap dump bag though and has a bit of hp gear instead of int since necro's
use hp in some way for a lot of spells.  Probably not a lot of help but I
have to offer it. =P (and no, thought horror fangs don't do jack in ammo)
The crystalline silk belt btw is not tailored but drops off a named kobold
in velks (got it at ldogs).
