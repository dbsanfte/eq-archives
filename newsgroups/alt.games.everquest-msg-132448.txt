I know how to Google.  It's fun to Google.

Which one are you?

Of course not.  All or nothing is just fine and dandy.  Comcast tried to 
go with nothing, but faced a backlash and reverted.  Tho their offering is 
still less than @Home was.  But once you start picking nits, you set down 
a long road.

I would like to hear about their reply when you get it.  Thanks.

Usenet is entertainment.  I can't fathom whining letter writing to 
officials who could care less as being entertaining, myself.  If you find 
it such tho that's great and I was wrong for suggesting peoples 
entertainment should all be the same.

That's nice.  Especially since I wasn't trying to intimidate you.


>It's a matter of what you seem to think you're entitled to.

Which IS WHAT?????

I could care less about your faith.  I just don't think you're making
sense.  And I don't like trespassers on a crusade.
