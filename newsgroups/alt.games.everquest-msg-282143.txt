Wouldn't take me 5 minutes to get the LDoN Stone.

For a start, it would take me about 50 seconds x number of zonelines just
to do the zoning, then travel time on top.  Assuming I'm a gnome and start
in PoK.  That's 1 x zone into Steamfont, 1 x zone into Ak'anon, 1 x zone
into Steamfont, 1 x zone into LFay, 1 x zone into GFay, 1 x zone into BB.
That's 6 x 50 seconds which is 5 minute spent just zoning.  Add in the run
times, and the time taken to navigate to the NPC in Ak'anon and it's more
like 10 minutes :p
