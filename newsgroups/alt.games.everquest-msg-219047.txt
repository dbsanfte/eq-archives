Same skill as used for skin line.  Alteration doesn't lag too badly
unless you group 100% of the time, and even then it's easy to run up.
I just thought it was off the wall.  My baby Ranger is 29.7 or so,
a bit more than 6 blues to L30 and the upgrade (which still lasts
for 3 min/lvl), so it's nothing more than a brief inconvenience.  It
just seemed silly to nerf a weak self-buff that Druids outgrow at 19
and Rangers at 30.  I mean, what's the point?  Why is somebody being
paid to do this?  Are they hiring programmers from defense contractors
now?  or what?

kaev <-- still bemused by the absurdity of the change at this late date
