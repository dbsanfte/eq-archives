Im no web site designer but by not supporting IE your simply taking a huge
chunk out of the traffic your site could receive. Force people to use a
different browser for no good reason and they will just think 'fuck this site',
especially if it's littered with those oh so annoying pop-ups. Besides, even
amongst the most ardent MS bashers Internet Explorer is viewed as an ok
browser.
