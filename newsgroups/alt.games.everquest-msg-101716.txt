  I really prefer to have the Shaman slowing mobs in groups that I'm in.
Sure, the enchanter can do it but combine mezzing a mob along with
slowing it makes the mob pretty mad at the enchanter. It's also not a
good division of mana in my opinion.

  As you get into groups with higher levels you should be seeing that
more and more. I can't remember the last group I was in where the
enchanter was doing the slows (assuming we had a Shaman as well). Shaman
slow > Enchanter slow. Shaman also have the AC to take a few hits from
the mob if slow is resisted.
