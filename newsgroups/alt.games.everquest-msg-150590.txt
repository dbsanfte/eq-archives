1) I didn't, as anyone down at the BBC could tell you, I was still at
least 5 months from epic when they changed it.

2) Bust my ass?  Took about a week and a half of actual work,
the "bust my ass" part consisted of putting my name on a list
and then ignoring it for five months (knowing I had 5 more
months of ignoring it to go)

3) I ignored starting my epic for at least a year, never started
it on my first character, because for most purposes I thought
it not worth the hassle.  Started this one because a guild leader
asked me to.  Left that guild long before getting epic, of course.

4) I don't think its worthless, I just think its not something for
me to carry equipped.  You didn't see me wearing my TBoots,
either; I carried them in an inventory slot available for use
as needed.  Currently I don't wear my Amulet of the Grey
Wastes, cause I have something more important in that
slot.  Its in a bag, I haul it out as needed.  Same with opal
encrusted steins.  Bag gear.  Cleric epic = bag gear.  Handy,
important, even weildable in certain encounters (where its
no use me even dreaming of melee-ing, or where mod rods
are available as a principle mana source... cause the extra
HP is sure a nice stat on the epic) but by and large,
every cleric past 56 has better handed to him on a silver
platter.

1) If raids were the only thing my cleric ever did, this would
be more important than it is.

2) Even on a raid, the use of that click stick is not constant, its
occaisional, and its a simple matter to pull it from bag, drop onto
primary slot, click as needed, and return it to bag.

3) I also have a Donal's Chestplate.  Click body, click rezed
victim = mana free rez and Cheal ;)  Still takes a ton of mana
to get people back on their feet, though, since I still have to
Aego or Symbol them, and the rest of the raid buffers have
to replace all their buffs.  Not dying is better plan.
