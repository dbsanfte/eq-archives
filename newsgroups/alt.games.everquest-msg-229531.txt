** Stability Issues **

The team here at the EQ Lab has isolated a memory leak which was
causing server instability after 10 to 12 hours of uptime (which we
are sure you have noticed)  We hope to have this issue resolved during
tonight's update. We would like to thank you all for your patience and
understanding during these last few trying days and wish you the best
of luck this holiday season.

Thanks for your time and thank you for being a part of Norrath.


Cheers
