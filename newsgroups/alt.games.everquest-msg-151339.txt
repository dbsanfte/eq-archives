Has anyone found a way to change the pet messages and warders name.  I found
the text strings in the eqstr_en.txt file and modified them.  However, it
does not read them.  Also, when I look at that file again after I have
played, my edits are gone.

File is not set to read only.  Only attribute set is Archive.

Thanks
