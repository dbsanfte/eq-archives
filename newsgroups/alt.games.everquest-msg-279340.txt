I have a upper-mid range gaming system.  Abit IC7-G, P4 3.0GHz Northwood, 1GB PC4000, BFG
6800 GT OC, Audigy 2.  I have a PC Power and Cooling Silencer 360ATX power supply, the big
Zalman CNPS7700-Cu CPU cooler with Artic Silver 5, a Zalman ZM-NB47J chipset heatsink with
Arctic Silver thermal adhesive, and an Arctic Cooling NV Silencer 5 (Rev. 2) on the GPU
with Arctic Silver 5.  It's all wrapped up in a nice big full tower case from a
long-defunct manufacturer.  The result is near-silent even under the heaviest loads, and
can run Doom 3 at playable frame rates, no problem, with the ultra-quality mod.

I keep FRAPS running during all of my gaming... http://www.fraps.com

Side note - don't use frame rates to compare the quality of gameplay between a shooter and
EQL - the player's tasks are so different, it's like comparing apples to oranges.

In EQL, I keep all of the eye candy turned to max.  Except shadows - I don't like their
particular brand of clutter.

While soloing, in most zones I'll see FPS rates well into the triple digits.  I very
rarely drop below 30FPS (which I would consider to be the bare minimum for persistence of
vision).

PoK frame rates sit in excess of 50, until I head dive into an MGB party, and keep all the
characters in my field of view....then I'll be lucky to see 15FPS.  I can hear the fan on
my 6800 GT kick into high gear :->  I almost always face a wall to keep things reasonable
(I used the same trick in the old bazaar).

Raid frame rates range from 25-50FPS, depending on my field of view, the visible area of
the zone, and the texturing used in the map.  I usually turn off "other's spell effects"
to contain the visual clutter of several dozen casters :->  I can see all the way across
the courtyard at Tormax' castle, or quite deep into Maiden's Eye from any of the ZIs.

Even in the mid-20s, EQL is very playable and looks as quite fine.

I haven't done a lot in DoN, so I really have no information to share about my rig's
performance in the revamped Lavastorm.  But it sure looked GREAT when I jumped in there on
the live date.  Then I bumped into a party who had engaged Tirranun, and he laid waste to
my evening...

Best regards,
