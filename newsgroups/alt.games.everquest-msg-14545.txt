Yawn.

Bizbee, it's hard to tell whether you're attempting to flame
here, or troll (or some of both), but either way my advice is the 
same:  don't bother, you're not very good at it.  Spite is a
poor substitute for talent.

If you don't have an actual rebuttal, you're just making yourself
look pathetic with the hoary old "off his medication" zing.
For god's sake, at least try to get some new material, that
one was old when people were sending their posts by semaphore flags.

In point of fact, the only medication I'm on at the moment
is "Preparation H", and I know better than to go off it,
because it's an effective Bizbee-inhibitor.
