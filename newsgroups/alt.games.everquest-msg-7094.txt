You have to wonder at this change. WTH are they thinking?

First they make combine kits so you can't 'eat' things in it
by hitting the combine button by accident. Then this made
trade kits too good for use as containers which they said
they never wanted, i.e. like the sewing kit which had 8 slots,
weighed 0.4, and could hold Giant sized items. So they upped
the weight of them so that carrying them as packs was not as
good. Ok fine.

But now they make the sewing kits 10 slots! So now they are perfect
for keeping stuff in the bank. They could weigh 100 lbs., or 1000 lbs.!
Who cares? They now have 10 slots and can hold any size item.
That just put a severe crimp in the backpack market, because most
people will only buy a couple tailored 10 slot backpacks to carry
on their person.
