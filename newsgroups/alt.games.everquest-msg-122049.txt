BL are the premier solo class, and I would bet exactly what you are
looking for. With the new pet changes (eq no exp taken if master does
at least 1 pt of damage), BL are a fanastic solo class.

Most players haven't figured that out yet, but I will let you in on
the secret.......Sustained damage over time is the key to soloing. The
BL class relies on melee damage more than spell casting. This allows
me to solo almost non-stop as long as I pick easy dark blues.

The BL can dish out damage equal to other hybrids, and his/her pet
tanks as good or better than a Mages earth pet. The pet level buff
(the spell you cast after summoning your pet or zoning) can be used as
a complete heal. It is amazingly mana efficient, and allows the BL to
sit back and let his pet tank while he meds and heals (playing "Pet
Cleric"). This may get nerfed in the future, because it allows a BL to
do amazing things, like taking on 3 dark-blue creatures at once at
level 18. I can't think of any other class that can do the same with
out using MEZ, ROOT , or FEAR to seperate the creatures..

You also get some great pet enhancement spells. At level 15 you get
your first 30pt DD magic based buff for your pet. It seems to process
a LOT, and before the recent pet changes I had a hard time equaling my
pets damage output, and lost 50% of the exp to him quite often.

The only downside I have found is the level range between pets. You
wait a LONG time between pet upgrades, and the closer you get to the
next one the weaker you will be:

Pet Levels:
9
15 (pet is level 16 when buffed)
22 (pet is level 22 when buffed)
30 (pet is level 26? when buffed)
39
49

As you can see when you are level 21 your pet is still level 16, and
the creatures you are fighting are levels 17-20. At this point your
pet will not be the killer you remember him being when you first got
him at 15.

The hell levels for the BL are 21, 38, and 48 :-)
