I hear this all the time about HHK, but I gotta say I have tried on 
several occasions, and it has never worked out any better than many other 
so-called lower xp areas. I found it to be *excruciatingly* boring. 
You're right, the pulls are few and far between, and the ZEM doesn't make 
up for their scarcity. Sure, when you kill a goblin, you will see your xp 
bar move more than many other places, but it doesn't happen with nearly 
enough frequency.

I say leave HHK to the xp grinding power gamers and find someplace more 
fun. On a good day Paludal Caverns is non-stop pulling that absolutely 
cannot be beaten for xp. On a bad day, it's no better than HHK. The 
beetles scattered thoughout the zone are usually good to go after. Just 
look out for the Phalarg (sp?) fiends who will aggro from all over 
sometimes.

Maybe Estate of Unrest would be an idea? Don't remember the level range 
there, but IIRC you're about right.
