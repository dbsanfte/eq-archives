Look at the weasel try to squirm out of the hole he dug now. :-) We're
not talking a strawman here, but a whole straw army. Let's point out
his frantic twists, shall we?


From the shadows, the mysterious "James Grahame"
<jamesgrahame@shaw.ca> (if that IS his real name) conspiratorially
whispered:

It's the truth, James, when applied to arguments I actually made. Of
course, you preferred to attack arguments that don't exist anywhere
but your thick head. Much easier to knock those down.

There was multiple quotes throughout the thread, James. And
regardless, the other link did go directly to a reference. As for
being right or wrong on the specifics....

Poor James shows his utter inability to comprehend logic or read
English once again. I never claimed to know all about it, just that I
was aware of what it was in a general sense, and I have now provided
uncontestable proof of such.

Your strawman is defeated, James. Sucks to be you.

Ignorant of the precise formula, James, as has never been questioned.
Not ignorant of ZEM in general. Fool.

Another defeated strawman. Try arguing against points actually raised,
James. Oh yeah, those are much harder, arent they? Much easier to just
make up your own arguments and knock those down....

You SUCK at this. :-)

Please do. They indicate quite nicely I did have a general idea of
what I was talking about.

You're starting to get quite laughable, actually. The idea that
something would be called a "zone experience modifier" and not have a
number likely to be the same for similar mobs in similar zones is
quite amusing. I begin to wonder if you know as much as you're
claiming.


> You are guilty of every misconception I've
>pointed out.

You are making up arguments I never made in order to give the
impression of being able to keep up, James.

We haven't forgotten. Indeed we wonder why you would bring up your
very first mistake. It certainly doesn't reflect well on your
argument. As was immediately shown, I didn't "bash" Ben at all, I
simply pointed out not everyone cared about the precise numbers.

Of course, James Grahame, who's density rivals lead, didn't pick up on
that, and now falls back to it even after having been shown how he's
wrong by, what? Four people now?

People saw through your ego, James. They saw you for what you were -
someone who was trying to look smart at the expense of others.

Note: no response. James decides rather than answering what I said he
would prefer to answer things he made up.

Only in terms of the assumptions made about the formula, James.


> You thought there could be a
>zero modifier - WRONG. You thought there was a default modifier - WRONG. You
>thought the ZEM was something that increased XP over and above "regular"
>XP - WRONG.

All relevent only to the formula, James.


> To use your gravity analogy, which you are so fond of, it's like
>saying that every object has a "default" gravity

On the surface of the earth, for all intents and purposes everything
does have a default gravity, James. An acceleration just under 10 m/s.

>additional modifier to that. So saying "I knew in general terms what a ZEM

Irrelevant, James. The fact I was wrong on the details of the math
does not indicate I was unaware of what a ZEM means in general terms,
as has been repeatedly shown and proven.

Yet another lie. The second link did go directly to the quote. Both
links were meant as links to threads. Another spin job by James to
avoid looking like the nimrod he does.

You've done about as well in this argument as the Iraqi army will do
in a couple days, James. You've presented nothing new, and everything
you've brought up before has been refuted. You've shown a classic
inability to follow links provided and general incompetance in
everything from logical arguments to analogies. You've made the silly
mistake of trying to prove you knew what someone was thinking better
than the person thinking it, and got burned, and burned badly. You've
retreated from arguing any points actually raised in favor of
attacking ones from your own imagination.

There isn't much point in talking to you further, James. Come back
when you have something new to add. Maybe someone will begin to
believe you then.
