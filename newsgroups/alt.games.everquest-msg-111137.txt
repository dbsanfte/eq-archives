Ted Kennedy and Hillary Clinton are Christians, what they are not is 
right-wingers (from an American point of view... seen from the middle of 
the average European political spectrum, both of them are certainly 
comfortably on the right wing). I think you may be confusing both terms.

Sure they can coexist. All you need to do is to discard all of the 
teachings of Christ that are too uncomfortable (that camel thing again).

I'm not up on my bible-reading, but I'll submit three: The "camel through 
the eye of a neddle" passage, the "sell all your belongings and follow 
me" passage, and Christ kicking some free-enterprise butt at the Temple 
entrance.
