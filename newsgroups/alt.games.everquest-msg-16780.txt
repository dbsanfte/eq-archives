RunnyEye would be my pick - with the recent revamp not much is known of the
place. So go explore :)
Dalnir's is a great dungeon. Take an evaccer if going anywhere past the
entrance level. Good variety of mobs with a fair few casters. Thankfully
lots of SK/Necros/Nukers and relatively few healer types.
Mistmoore is great exp but you are at the mercy of other people while there.
It only takes one idiot to reduce the zone to chaos for everyone there. Well
worth a look though.
I never hunted much in Cazic but the place is rammed with healer mobs.
SolA is one of my favourites. Very trainy, lots (LOTS) of Wizard/Shaman
mobs. Wizards are deadly at these levels and SoWed runners always liven
thing up. Unfortunately SolA seems to be solely populated by high level
farmers, powerlevellers and twinks these days.
Upper Guk would be very green apart from the back sections near the lower
guk zone and Ancient Croc area. Worth a look though, as the deep zones are
fairly easy to run to. Again, lots of shaman mobs, so everything will be
SoWed.

You could also try places such as Unrest basement, Permafrost King area (go
have a look before they redress this dungeon if you've never seen it before)
or Nurga. There are plenty of choices at your level :)
