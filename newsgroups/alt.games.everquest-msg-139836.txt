}Well, YOU would be wrong, as has been proven time and time again..

Please, provide a link to even one example.

It's very easy to understand.  You have not said where on IRC. I know t's 
a difficult concept for you, but without that otherwise fairly trivial 
piece of info, there's not likely to be much availing on anyone's part.

}No balls really can hamper you in later life, though... You might want
}to check Ebay and see if you can get yourself a backbone cheaply...

I notice that you still have failed to name the channel or the server in 
question.  What do you expect us to do, wnader around to all the thousands 
of channels available and ask, "Erm, excuse me, is EQ in here?"

Or perhaps you're afraid someone will call your bluff.
