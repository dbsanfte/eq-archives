I am in a large guild and I can confirm that it is a combination of
TBS and the Guild Hall where people hang out. 

As to the barding in relation to the pally/SK horses there is a guard
in the stables in the Bazaar that you hail, make sure you have
/claimed the barding, follow along with the text and he 'applies' the
barding to your summoned horse. You will still have the barding bridal
tho and it will summon a barded horse but it is equal to the slowest
horse for movement. 

My main: Corelulos lvl 72 paladin
Guild: Coniglietto Avariatto, our guild is a family/raiding type
guild. We accept unguilded players of any level and usually have 40
plus players on at a time.

Raiding in our guild is non mandatory and loot is officer awarded. I
have been in a highend DKP guild as well and I can say at first I was
dubious about the officer awarded loot, however the officers are
actually very fair about the loot.

If you play on Druzzil Ro and CA sounds like the type of guild you
would like to join send anyone a tell and ask for an officer, there is
usually one or more online.
