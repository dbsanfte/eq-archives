Er, tailoring and smithing actually, wood elves can make a variety of
cultural smithed weapons. I started smithing to make tailoring supplies
like studs and bonings. Now my tailoring is getting highish, I decided
to get my smithing up in order to make mithril studs and boning for
cultural tailoring. Well, my smithing skill has far outstripped my
tailoring skill since currently all my raw materials can be bought from
vendors - smithing is 162 at the moment.

I'm making a fair old return now from wood elf cultural smithing -
mainly on Imbued Mithril Feir'Dal Morningstars - Tunare only, 1HB 9/35,
WIS+2 CHA+2 AGI+4 (Karana versions are DEX instead of CHA, otherwise
identical). They are a nice weapon for mid-level druids, since if you
want anything else with +WIS, you're looking at something like a
wraithbone hammer (+2 WIS, 500pp or so) or velium-etched stone mace (+3
WIS, 500pp-1kpp). The Feir'Dal morningstars go like hotcakes in level
20ish zones like SK or LoIO.

I'm a druid, so I can imbue the emeralds myself, and sometimes find a
halfling to imbue any plains pebbles I have for making Karana versions.

I guess I'm selling a few a week at the moment, so not a complete waste
of time. Probably helps that I've never seen anyone else on my server
selling the things (only ever seen one person selling wood-elf cultural
leather for that matter) - I imagine I'll flood the market with my wares
to the point of saturation fairly soon, but for now its a moneyspinner.

I intend to make tailoring my grand master trade skill, since I can't
smith cultural armour, but wood-elf smithing isn't a complete waste of
time...
