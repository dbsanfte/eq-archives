Not really.  I've been discussing my own situation rather constantly
throughout this thread, IMO.  *shrug*

Not a matter of bothered.  Our 'regular' shaman is 60.  He was 57 or so when
PoP came out, so it's already been very good to him.   I believe he's going
full AA at the moment, to get "Canni BOOM" before returning to leveling.
At level 60, shaman haste is celerity.  40 percent, I believe?

Once again... "bothered" to level up.  Heh.    We have precisely one
beastlord in our guild.  He's about 58 now, 56'ish when PoP came out.

What percent haste is he casting before 63?  Yep, pale imitation sounds
about right...

Clarity level mana regen is nothing.   At level 60, I can't think of a
priest or caster class that does not already have equal or better regen from
thier own spells.  Beastlord mana regen would turn self-clarity into
self-C2.  Still way under par.
