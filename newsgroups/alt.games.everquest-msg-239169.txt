Nope.  A Little thing called Anger Augments have been taking up all of my
points as of lately. Aggro management is a huge concern for me, and as you
can probably imagine my guilds not ready for Avatar of War, and prices on
BoC's are over 400K,  so I have dropped about 2000 pts into Anger 2 Augments
looking for the correct combination of weapons. The other points have been
spent on BADLY needed Neck piece upgrade, and various and sundry augments
that I purchased before I even knew about the Royal Attended BP of sand.

Mind you this isnt bitching...  I enjoy the fact that I actually have a
fighting chance at keeping aggro now against a SK / Pally, or when a caster
gets a little Nuke happy, its a very welcome change indeed.
