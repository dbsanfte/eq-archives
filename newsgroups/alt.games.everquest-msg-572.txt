You must be in range of a mob when it dies to get exp.  My cleric
had some trouble with this a while back when I learned to fear kite:
sort of the reverse of your situation.  Instead of running off in search
of more prey while the kill was taking place, I was sending the mob
(snared) walking away from me, and sitting to med.  If fear broke the
tanks would bring it back to our pull spot where I'd reapply fear
(reducing the odds that the mob would run far enough to get the group
into trouble) but on the occaision where it lasted longer than usual
I'd get faction but no exp.

Now I hop up, jog forward to near the mob, attack and sit, and
repeat when the weapon cycles.  Lets me turn in about half the
damage that the real tanks do, still get full use of med time, and
keeps me near the mob for exp... not to mention being there in
case of adds.  Never had really considered how far a feared mob
oculd walk off if it had high HP and we had low damage tanks working
on it!  ( I reccomend a high delay weapon for this trick)
