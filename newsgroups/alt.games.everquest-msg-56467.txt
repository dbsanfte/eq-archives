Well, the way I see it, a person in this age of moderate means WOULD have a
map, probably bought from another adventurer... Since EQ does not provide
this service in-game, I have to resort to websites, and I DO. I'm 43rd and I
STILL get lost in several of the cities that I don't always go to (south
qeynos for instance). Getting lost and wasting time looking for the zone is
irritating to me... and I'm not playing and paying to be irritated (more
than necessary :).
