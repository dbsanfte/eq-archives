Yep, very much so, ditto. I still have not quit it though I don't know
why. Its a very poor replacement for EQ it turns out and I will soon
likely do a 360 and cancel AO while reopening my EQ account.. sadly..
Oh my god someone make a good mmorpg to get me out IT JUST CAN'T BE
THIS FREAKING HARD TO TOP EVERCAMP I TRY TO GET OUT BUT THEY PULL ME
BACK IN!!!

Yep exactly, jeez this seems almost exactly like posts I write
constantly about the same thing. Yep, AO rewards to the point where
you get the reward just by logging in nearly almost as though someone
just handed it to you therefore actually running through the missions
or grouping for 2 hours to get it all is just going through the
motions. At its best and high reward point EQ might be like a sexual
conquest while AO is like masturbation, you can always do it any old
time but it leaves you cold.

Yep, they put in TOO DAMN MUCH of EVERYTHING that players wanted ADDED
TO games like Everquest. All the features of AO are things that would
work GREAT in everquest the way everquest IS now as supplementary
content. I.E, If you got bored of trying to go to tov to get your very
best druid armor with your guild, you could go off on an on the fly
generated quest for some sub par druid armor that at least was better
than your shroud of nature you are still wearing at level 54.
The problem though in AO is that it CAN be the BEST armor for you at
that level so its not summlementary but rather the WHOLE SMEAR, the
PINNACLE of what you can get.

Exactly. Its funny but the AO newb area which is a "Holo World" made
to train new omni persons is kind of a mirror of the entire rest of
the game, going through the motions virtually. I go from a worn cyber
bp to a better worn cyber bp for 25 levels then a worn bau cyber bp
and finally now at level 32 by pushing the slider way up a quality
level 38 worn waitt bp that I had to buy 3 implants just to wear. In a
few levels I'd get a quality level 40, yay and more waitt for a long
time until whatever next similar kind. While doing that I also would
be buying my heal as a doctor that heals like 250 hp then the next
immediate level or two 270 then 290 or 300 etc.. forever and ever with
no milestone or nothing really new but upgraded stuff.

Meanwhie in EQ getting heal at 19 was a big deal, self tp at 19, sow
at 14, group tps at 29, greater heal at 29 or whenever, superior heal
at 53 (before they moved it to 51) and chlorblast at 55. All of those
were milestones because there were many times large spaces inbetween
them and they added a very large improvement to your character. There
was a very big reason to move from 29 towards that goal of 49 when you
got several good things as a druid, you always had sight of that. The
same would be true of a cleric and revive and finally the level 49
res.
