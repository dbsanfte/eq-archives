EQ?

You mean the game that has occupied my life for the past 6 months?
You mean the game that has taken me on an emotional roller-coaster back and
forth across Norrath?
You mean the game that I introduced my girlfriend and best friend to, and
have never seen them since?

Never heard of it.. ;)
Actually, I think an EQ crossover show would be just a WEE bit too obscure
for even the most refined (I can't believe I just called our audiences
refined) audience.

Cheers!
