I thought, for about 25 levels, I was an OK Healer. Now, at level 51,
I know that Ranger healing = No Healing.

Clerics, Druids, Shamans all heal much better than Rangers.
Paladins and to a point Necromancers are superior healers to Rangers.

At 51 my best heal is healing, which heals 90 points. It is completely
pointless relying on this during a fight, as in the time it takes to
cast, most mobs will have done way more than 90 points of damage.

We get greater healing at (approx, not 100% sure) Level 57.

I'm not having a go or anything, but Rangers are not healers, either
primary or backup.
