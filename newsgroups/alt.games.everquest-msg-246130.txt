There used to be this spawn in lake Rathe that was 'perfect monk solo' from
20-24 or so. You start fight.  mend at 50%. If mend failed you may die, but
at that point it rarely failed. Kill target. bandage to 50. Sit down. Wait
for respawn. At respawn you were usually around 95-100% health.

It wasn't a fast respawn.

Mind you, this was pre-kunark.

But it was 'exciting high speed soloing' for the monk :P

Hmm wonder if a feigned monk counts as sitting. I am 99% sure not. Oh well.
