OMFG! Microsoft doesnt have anything either! Damn them! One of the largest
companies in the world, and they cant stop to put a little message on their
website! Comedy Central was on the air all day! How could they think of
comedy on the anniversary of 9/11?

Oh wait. I dont care. Yes, thats right. *I DONT CARE*. I dont care how many
people you lost in WTC. I dont care if you personally knew every person that
died that horrible day. Expecting every organization out there to give you a
little sympathy is silly. *LOTS* of things had absolutely zero mention of
9/11. Sure, it wouldnt have hurt to put a little something in the MOTD, but
going apeshit over them neglecting to is insane. Go get drunk, feel crappy
about things, but dont get pissed if everyone else isnt right there with
you.

Yeah, 9/11 was a terrible day. I dont need/want everyone telling me how bad
it was. I know!! I want to get on with my life. I dont want to forget, but
this is BS...
