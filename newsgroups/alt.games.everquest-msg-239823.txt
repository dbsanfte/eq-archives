Wow I insulted you and you use the old "quitting talking about
yourself" comeback. I used to do that a lot... when I was in 2nd grade.

Oh I'm sorry but could you show me where that happened. All I saw was a
person making a post trying to introduce people to a new community.
Rather than welcoming or supportive replies I saw some people trying to
be cool.

Yeah these forums where we come from.. I don't think I've ever seen a
post where someone was thinking of joining the game. Come to think of
it, I don't think I've ever heard of people retiring from EQ either.
You do have a truly unique community here. I can see that you range
from people who suck (for instance you and 42) to some nice people that
welcomed the newcomers.

I never said that everyone here was an ass nugget. My post was to point
out that Dave was the first one to post a nice greeting.
Self-important? I sure am. Killfiles? Don't bring a knife to a
fistfight pussy. I don't know what percentage you Bizbee's make up in
this place but I'm sure I'll find out.  
Not going anywhere until I'm bored, banned or you verbally kick my ass.
