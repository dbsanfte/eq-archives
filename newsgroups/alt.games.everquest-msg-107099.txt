This is always been a false statement. This believe that a persons knowledge of
the game gets lower with the higher quality gear they receive. Are you trying to
suggest that the better gear a person gets the less they know about the game? If
they trade in all their cloth armor for leather at level 5 they would actually
get less knowledgable about how to play the game?

I would like to submit that anyone who "dominates a zone" is a jerk and that
jerks do play the game of EverQuest. I would like to also submit that "jerkdom"
knows no class, race, level, deity loyalty, guild status, or any other in the
game. Twinks do not "dominate a zone". Jerks "dominate a zone". I remember back
when I first started playing EverQuest and created my very first character on a
server that just open that day. You know what I found out in that short time.
There were Jerks "dominating a zone". The dominated it on a server that could
not very well have that many twinks on it since it went live only that day.
Jerks exist in the game and it is wrong to blame any set of people because of
their actions. New players that do not know better then to dominate the zone
could be just as much the problem as a twink who is dominating the zone.

And on another point, most of the times I have ever seen someone bring up the
comments and examples about someone dominating a zone, the real culprit was the
fact that they were hunting in a crowded zone. Put 4 full groups on Orc Hill in
Greater Faymart and it will look like someone is "dominating the zone". Place
more people in an area that was designed for less and it will always look like
someone is getting more then their "fair share" of the mobs. And people will
always look for someone else to blame for their troubles. Before people go
blaming those who twink they alternate characters, they should do a /who on the
zone. If there is more then 100 people in a zone, you are defently in the wrong
zone. If the area is very small and there are more then 20 people there, you are
defently in the wrong location. Each fighting area in Everquest is designed for
a set number of people. Place more then what was designed and you have a problem
of "to many rats for the cheese".

Lets see. By definition, most twinks have higher level alternate characters. By
having higher level alternate characters, they will generally know a majority of
the zones in the game (especially low level ones). They will know the general
mechanics of the game (ie. how to /assist, how to /follow, how to group). They
will know some general abilities of other classes. While it is true they may not
know the specific details about their new class they are playing, they do not
need to learn the general mechanics of the game at the same time they are
learning the specifics of their new class. This is not true with true new
players playing their first character since they not only have to learn their
character abilities but the general mechanics, as well. Can you explain to me
how your come to the conclussion that twinks know little about playing the game?
How is it that they no less then someone who has never played before of the same
level and class? Sure, a level 12 twink druid does not know as much about the
druid class as that of a level 60 druid. But you know what? A level 12 twink
does not need to know as much as the level 60 since the level 12 twink is ONLY
LEVEL 12. What you can be sure of is that a level 12 twink would most likely
know more then a level 12 new player.
