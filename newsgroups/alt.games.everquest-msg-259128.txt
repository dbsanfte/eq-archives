Its not information I would ever make public, and the conversations happen
after both guilds have killed said mob anyway.

I mean unless they killed it with pure zerg and mega luck thats one thing...
but its hardly spoiler information, when you discuss different methods with
somebody whos guild already has a successful working strat.   If your strat
works well and has been used for 5 wins in a row, your not exactly gonna
then go and change it because another guild uses something totally different
that may or may not work better.

I mean the strats are formed on a guilds own strengths, and our 2 guilds
don't share those same strengths.  As an example, we often raid with 20+
less people than James' guild, they raid with less(or no) monks.. so pull
strats have to be different, or we have to take lesser risks where death is
involved as it hurts us more.  They may have 9 shamans, a curer for every
group!  Or 5 druids to make heal chains and cover ramp tanks -- we have 1
max each day.  If stuff needs handling by a misc class, they may kite it
with their excess druids, we may tank it with our high xxx numbers class..
etc.

And for people who will say "see, you just confirmed having spoilers don't
make much difference because guilds are different".. thats not what im
saying at all.  The GoD fights have at least one TOTALLY UNIQUE (to the mob
AND game) special ability or trick, which once you know, makes a fight
incredibly easy.. but before you know, its hair pulling out frustrating....
one example, Inktu'ta stonemites:

We were one of the first guilds gamewide to beat the zone (and learning it
when it had not been beaten), there was NO info anywhere.  The stonemites
area took days to figure out what was involved and execute it cleanly (if
you are slow, you get overrun with mites... and learning = slow), days which
was multiplied by the 2day lockout each night we went.  Of course the zone
wasn't finished, got patched and changed during our learning process, to
subsequently help the newer guilds to the zone.
