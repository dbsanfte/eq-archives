I'm not a matematician, but I think the reason the formula is kept
simple is because the character comparing two weapons isn't going to
have the numbers for his skill and strength changed (at least not by
much) when comparing one sword to another.  The damage, the delay, and
the damage bonus are much more important.  It's sort of like the
formula for a car's stopping distance being so many car lengths when
moving at a certain speed; while the current wind speed will affect
the actual stopping distance, there's not much need to factor it in
even if someone had a 100% accurate formula.

Another factor is raid buffs often put a melee character at his max
strength any way.  That is to say, while the weapon's STR stat may
affect the damage output of the weapon when the character is buffless,
it makes no difference when he is buffed to max STR before wielding
the weapon.  And since melee characters use their weapons often, the
formulas are also assuming the characters are at their maximum skill,
or soon will be once they have been in a few fights.
