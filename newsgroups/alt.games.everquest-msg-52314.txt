Self DS worked well for me into the high 30s. You can't take on reds
that way, of course, we're talking low blues here. It's a helluva lot
more fun than medding.

I was equipped for AC during that time, btw, mostly Ulthork and self-made
reinforced leather. Self-buffed AC was over 700. It's still (barely) over 
700 now even though I've switched to +WIS gear, thanks to maxed defense.
