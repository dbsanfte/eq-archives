    I'm surprised any of the links are broken, considering what they changed
with the patch. Before the patch, you could link to "0014236test", and you'd
get a link to database item 0014236 whatever it was. Now, there's a checking
routine so if "test" isn't the name of item 0014236, you get no link. We'd
already made lists of all the stuff of interest, like the extended holy
symbols and the CT tradeskill stuff, so we can still get that stuff back
because we know the name and number. But I didn't find out how to do it
until it was too late, so I didn't get to try what I was really interested
in. I wanted to look through the entire database to try and figure out if
there were any old, unsolved quests out there and try to solve them or
establish they were broken. That would have been fun!

    And for the curious: yes, they put stuff into the database sequentially,
more or less. So if a quest calls for lore item one, lore item two, and
gives out item three, usually those three items will have consecutive
numbers. That's what would allow someone to go in and check that sort of
thing. You can still do it a little bit with Magelo, but it's not as good
because you can't see anything that hasn't been archived to Magelo.
