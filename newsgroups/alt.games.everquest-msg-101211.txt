*whispers*

Smiley, ol bun, that was what he was saying.

You stated the general opinion to be something. He suggested, somewhat
impolitely, that you only ever deign to proffer your own opnion, as he
disagreed most vociferously and obviously his opinion is more (or at least
"as", I would guess would be the instant response) reflective of the "general"
opnion than any you may purport to have garnered.

Of course, you shot yourself in the foot by not reading his reply well enough
to comprehend it before flaming him for english comprehension skills...

But.... now you've done that... you obviously have to quit... so....


....

Can I have your stuff?
