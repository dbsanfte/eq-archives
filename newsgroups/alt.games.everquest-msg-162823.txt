Let's put it this way -- my Paladin has had Run3 for
months now.  Whenever I play my alts instead (they
have no AA abilities) and run them across a zone,
it feels like I'm BLOODY CRAWLING in comparison.

I'm constantly checking to see if they're encumbered,
or ducking, or have "Walk" switched on accidentally.
Nope, it's just that I'm spoiled with Run3.

It's that noticeable.
