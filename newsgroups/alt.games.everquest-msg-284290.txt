Having your guild progress onto harder and harder stuff by gearing up and 
learning the fights was how it was intended.
Sadly tho most lower guilds were stuck in place as people progressed through 
the guilds.
You would be constantly gearing up and backflagging new recruits as your 
older and beter equipped members jumped into higher end guilds.

Ive even read a post by one of the eq developers a while back where they 
admited that the keying process in POP didnt work out how it was intended.

It certainly does inconvenience the casual player/guild
Many of the raid mobs in the elemental planes are much easier than getting 
flagged. Flagging is a bottleneck, particularly RZ for guilds that are 
struggling for numbers. (and who could easily be soing several bosses in 
POF)
