I have a friend (who has a 50 necro and 28 monk) who recently started a lightly
twinked bard. With even mid range regen buffs (and his own songs) he was able to
kite upto 7 mobs in steamfont and hit lvl 20 in about 18 - 20 hrs of playing. I
didn't believe it until I saw it, he was actaully pissing off the steamfont
groups because he was taking a bulk of the spawn. However he has stalled (to
normal levelling speed) at lvl 23 or so.
