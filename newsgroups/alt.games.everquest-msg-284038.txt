One other thing about KHJ (Jhiru) that I recall is that he has got some
mutant anti-Defensive (Warrior disc) code where if you have a war and
he mashes /defensive upon seeing the appalling damage that is incoming
from KHJ, KJH gets annoyed emotes something looses all interest in the 
Warrior and goes out and pulps the remainder of the group before 
going on to slay the Warrior.  Best thing for that event is a
charmed hasted pooka and using the riposte discipline.
