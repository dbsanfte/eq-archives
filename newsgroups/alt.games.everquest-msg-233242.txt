Crowd Control: mesmerising, rooting, or pacifying extra monsters so the
party can concentrate on fighting one at a time.  a "CCer" is a class
which can perform these functions.

Camp Check: someone is asking which "camps" in the zone are occupied.

Crystal Caverns: a zone in Velious, entered via a clicky orb in Eastern
Wastes.
