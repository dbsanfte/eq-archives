Noone asks for it because the Essence emerald required means someone I
think it's 46+ has to take an exp loss death (non rezzed) to donate
their "essence" for the spell.  It's two spells Sacrifice at 51 and
convergence at 53 which maxes out at 93% exp regained.

Saw one the other day and it does look much like a ducks head on a
stick, I think it is supposed to be like a sarnak skull or something,
but it looks like a duck.
