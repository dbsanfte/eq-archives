I was -[this]- close Sunday to casting my new Illusion:Iksar spell that I 
finally decided to quest - sitting in the building where I got it.

Casting Illusion:Iksar in Firiona Vie is up there with playing your new 
Chords of Dissonance in town, except at level 37, you should know better.

I did, however, die running to into FV with my Illusion:Troll on Saturday.

/gu WTF?  That friggin' Drixie thing just slammed me as I ran by?
Soon-to-be-rezzing Cleric says in guild: Got an Illusion on?
/gu Good point.
LOADING... PLEASE WAIT

The part that pisses me off the most is that I was running into town to 
bind.
