Clarification: this is with a pet that cons evenly to me v. a blue monster.
I agree that the difference is not significant, and that I did it more in
the interest of science than anything else, but hey.

Hmm.  I thought support characters were there to offer support. . .
Frankly, if the casters (and some hybrids) don't make the tanks (and/or
hybrids) feel confident, there is a problem.  Especially if the caster is a
Cleric or and Enchanter.

As a class, Enchanters are in a unique position.  They're flexible to the
point of being a little difficult -- there's a steep learning curve.
They're probably one of the least understood "group support" characters in
the game, and a lot of folks have had bad 'Chanter experiences.  Hence,
making the group happy is a priority.  Not the highest, mind you, but it's
important (at least to level 30 -- you seem to have completely lost touch
with the under 50 world).

Also, the Enchanter's "crowd control" duties often carry over to "group
control".  For things to work well, the group has to cooperate and
communicate with the 'Chanter.  'Chanters in groups are just as dependent on
the group trusting them/trusting their group as a tank is.  I can't tell you
how many groups my tank has left because the 'Chanter wasn't communicative
with his group (and kept getting us killed), or how appreciative I was when
the same tank wound up in a group toward the bottom of (new) Befallen with
one that knew what he was doing.  A 'Chanter used well not only makes a
group frighteningly effective -- he or she can make a group feel really good
and enjoy the camp.

I will grant that some of this becomes less relavent as one levels, but in
any MMORPG, the social/interpersonal angle almost always applies.

I often have to educate my groups on what I cast, what it does, and why I
may or may not be doing something.  Given the flexibility of the Enchanter
class, there are many ways to do the same thing.  Some are more efficient
than others, while others may be more suited to other play styles.  As it
stands, communication and confidence are key.

I maintain that my decision not to be a "Rules Lawyer" is a valid one.  Game
mechanics are always an important consideration, but they are not the be-all
and end-all of my EQ experience.  I'm sorry, but I'm agreeing to disagree
with you on some points because my play style is different.  People can (and
do) play like I do and still get to level 60.  They may not do it as
efficiently as you may like. . .but, in the words of my Enchanter's guild
sponsor/mentor, "It's a fucking online game.  There is no room for drama
here.  You're not here to be a l33t hax0r kiddie.  You're here to have fun.
So have fun!  If you can make other people happy while you're having fun,
you make yourself look good , you make me look good, and you make the guild
look good."

The point that I have made here again and again is that you and I, having
different play styles, have very different goals.  Your idea of fun is
learning the system, using it as efficiently as possible, and using the
numbers to win.  That's great, and it reveals a good mind.  Enjoy it.
That's kind of what we're here to do.  8)

> Then find a new game.

No.  If I'm happy (and have a low death ratio), my groups are happy, and my
guild is happy, why should I leave?

Oh, that's right.  I'm inefficient.  Fortunately, I pay my EQ bill
efficiently, buy expansions efficiciently. . .And I have a poor enough
understanding of game mechanics.  Poor enough to agree overall with your
points but still have my own insight.  Right.

Yeah.  I'll leave.  Just for you, buddy.  Yup.  This is me leaving.

*logs in and plays instead*

Why you feel compelled to make me "wrong" by presenting your play style as
the One True Way (all others lead nowhere) is a bit beyond me.  You need to
accept that other people may not play like you do, and will enjoy
themselves/advance their characters just the same.  And if you don't like
that, maybe YOU should find another game.  I don't recommend MMORPGs,
though.  Too many people like me running around.  8)

Reads the packaging?  *grin*

Astigmatism, actually.  And Farsighted, if I'm not mistaken.  I'm actually
getting new glasses today, so that might clear this up.  Or it might just
get me new glasses with which to enjoy the new textures in a couple of
weeks.  With zippy clip-on sunglasses!  Yay!

> 2.  Under level 30.

Incorrect.  8)
