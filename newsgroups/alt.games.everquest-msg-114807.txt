And once again Drake performs the act that's made him famous
world-wide! Yes, folks, you know the one! Entering a thread, Not to
state an opinion on any of the topics being discussed, Not to offer an
argument against a given position, but rather to simply (and I do mean
"simply") attack the other people participating!

Exhilarating, isn't it? The hush of the crowd, the murmur of rising
anticipation, the squeaks of excitement from the little ones, then
Wham! Out of the blue, the complete and utter lack of intellect
displayed by our intrepid performer, shocking us all with his bravery,
wit, and utter lack of relevance!

Just think, folks, you can tell your children and grandchildren that
you actually got to see Drake perform, at the height of his career, at
the pinnacle of his skills, back when he thought he was something more
than a dung-slurping slug!

For the collectors in the audience tonight, 8x10 signed color glossies
of some of Drakes most insipid performances are available in the
lobby. Yes, signed! But never fear, they were signed in crayon - we've
long since learned not to let this clown handle sharp objects!

Isn't he amazing folks? Let's all give him a warm round of applause!
