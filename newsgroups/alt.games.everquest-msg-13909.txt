If you're really in a hurry you can try resetting her yourself. There
seems to be a limit as to how far a merchant NPC will go from their
station and stay there. I've seen merchants in EC pulled only a little
ways away and stay there for days. However, if they are a LONG way off
station, it appears they will *generally* (nu guarantee here) head back
to their proper station. You could try getting SoW, popping her once,
and dragging her all the way to the zone. She may well head back to her
tent after that and open up shop again.
