She would have to use your account, since you already used the keys
for the account (the cd keys)

The characters are never deleted by verant, not ever. Even if YOU
delete them they are still there and a server GM is MORE than happy to
undelete them for the $12.95 per month you will be paying.

They want your money and for you to come back, more than anything. It
behooves them to never delete characters.

No, unless you never used the account codes.

Yes, she is stuck have to purchase them herself OR she could 
play your account. This is not a very good idea though, because
eventually you will want your account back. I'd have her splurge and
just get the new EQ GOLD edition coming out in europe or something
which should be here soon. Its kunark, velious and luclin for I think
a very good single game price.
