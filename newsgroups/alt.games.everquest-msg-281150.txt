For *several* months after the game was released it was impossible for 
shamen to train in alchemy. It was a tradeskill so the max the 
guildmaster would train you was to 20 points, but you didn't get the 
skill until 25 so they wouldn't train you at all. Your first skillup 
couldn't be purchased and you couldn't get any other skillups until you 
purchased it. SOE/Verant told us alchemy was working fine, despite 
people complaining about it for months on end.

Trusting SOE to get it right is a bad idea. Concluding something doesn't 
work after a couple short tests is useless, but the collective mass of 
testing over a non-trivial period of time is the only way some of these 
bugs are ever detected. SOE rarely does adequate testing, so we have to 
step up to the task if we suspect something isn't working.
