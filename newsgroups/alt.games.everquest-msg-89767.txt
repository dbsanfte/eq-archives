Yes I've heard of the Gateway EQ box, but you missed the
point.  The OP is a flake with a self glorifying adolescent
fantasy that somebody somewhere cares about his opinion.
Hence the so-called petition.  ("See, everybody agrees with
me!")

Large corporations do indeed have people on staff to handle
such flakes, usually in the PR department.  Such staffers just
don't have much contact with upper management policy makers.
I feel fairly certain (!) that this nut will have precisely
zero effect on Gateway, Intel, or Sony.  YMMV

Btw, Dell is the only US PC maker to sell more units in 2001
than in 2000.  Gateway et al, had a tough year.  :-/
