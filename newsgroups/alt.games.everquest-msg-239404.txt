You say you like to melee at times, even if you dont melee my recommendation
is to work on your defensive AA. get your combat agality up to 3 and put
some into lighting reflexes. I have found in hard LDoN a cleric with max
defense can take a heck of a beating until the crowd control can recover,
with your nice use of AA to reduce and even nullify your chance to be
interupted you can keep everyone else alive while minimizing the damage you
take. just my 2cp worth , but I highly recommend LR to every class.
Good luck and happy EQ :)
