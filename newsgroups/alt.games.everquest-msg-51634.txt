If you refuse to get in and get hit, your defense skill won't go up.
Then when you get to the point where your AC matters, you won't
be able to get it up to its best levels regardless of what you wear...
and at higher levels, it becomes much harder to raise defense.

Better to get some AC up and use your porcupine approach to
kill stuff at low levels where its still your most efficient damage
procucer.  Then at higher levels, you need only dedicate yourself
to getting +5 defense every level, which isn't that much of a chore.
I had to take my cleric from 25 defense to 175 Defense over
a few levels, and it was hell doing so.  I'll never make the mistake
of allowing a character's defense to lag behind like that again,
as it literally added 1/3rd to my AC with similar equipment.

Raw mana available doesn't matter much at lower levels, perhaps
with twice as much mana you can take on higher level mobs... but
you simply incur longer med times by doing so.  Its not till higher
levels that you get to a point where you really -need- higher mana
count to do anything.

Also, WIS gear doesn't produce much in the way of mana at
low levels anyway.  If mana is really your goal, +mana gear
tends to be a better way to spend your money in the short term;
this tends to break even at around level 25, where +1 wis
equals +5 mana, which is about the price ratio (1 wis costs
the same as 5 mana more or less)
