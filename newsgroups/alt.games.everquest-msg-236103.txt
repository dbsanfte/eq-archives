That's not so bad.It starts to suck when the item you have to obtain
is a rare drop from a rare spawn... wandering around hailing all the
npcs would be a godsend compared to "discovering" what you have to
kill by killing every zone in the game 20x or more over to see what
drops what you need.

Yeah... nice in theory. The reality is a spoilersite as you noted,
where you spend more time researching a quest outside of the game than
inside of it.

So much for social interaction ;)

We need a new quest paradigm. They need to be dynamically generated,
and they ideally need to be keyed to information the character has
access to, not the player.
