I might get a bit more life out of it than most, I am a bit of a wuss
playing games and I get more enjoyment from exploring interesting areas and
skills rather than rising too and overcoming challenges. I think it comes
from playing games as a relaxation after work, or it just may be that I
don't have a competetive (or competent) spirit. Anyway - too easy doesn't
bother me too much and my skill majors are so <not> optimum that it is
proberly just as well ; )
