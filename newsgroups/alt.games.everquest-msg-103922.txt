    As a cleric, I have to dissent here. At the uppermost levels (once you
have melees equipped in full Kael/Skyshrine armour), you begin to find that
melees can solo pretty well. *If* they go looking for a partner, they want
one that can add damage output and not defense. Our clerics get groups by
being the ones to organize outings, by getting AoE group work or by luring
folks to places difficult enough that they can't be soloed (like Cazic
Thule). But when raiding is over for the day most of our melees disappear
into Fungus Grove and solo themselves another alt XP point while our clerics
rearrange their bank account again.

    Enchanter is a very high-stress position compared with other classes at
lower level. You also end up dying a lot at the high end, and don't stack
well (once you have more than a few enchanters on a raid the rest have
nothing to do).

    Warrior is a career with a future. More warriors are needed as offtanks
in these ring-style encounters, so you won't find yourself useless on raids.
You also solo fairly well once you get to the top. You're very
equipment-based, though, and compete with classes that offer more than you
at lower levels.

    Wizards are exceptional as a raid class. The lower levels are brutal,
though, and you have to go in knowing that almost all your XP will be picked
up on raids, in AoE groups, or soloing. Pickup groups will actively shun
you.

    If I was asked what class to pick that would be enjoyable at all levels,
I'd say a shaman. You solo very well for most of your career (some bumpy
spots pre-34), twink gear is plentiful for your class (four pieces of Kunark
armour that can usually be picked up for 500 pp or less), you are sought
after for grouping even at the highest levels (haste and mana-free damage
alone ensure you a spot), and raids are starting to use more shamans as
healers for classes that eat mod rods and not just as buff/debuff monkeys.
That class, to me, is one that's fun to play at all levels of the game.
