Ok...  Sounds like sound advice, but for two things...

First off...Since all three of my characters are low-level, I haven't been
outside of the newbie areas with any of them yet (except the one time I
accidentally zoned, and got my bard killed by a lion), so I don't really
know much about the lay of the land.  Where's Highpass, and where do I find
Deathfist orcs?

Second...  If my monk is hated, because he's an Iksar, how the heck to I get
into a city so that I can turn in scalps and stuff?
