OK that makes sense then. It just seemed odd because at my level and any
below it, EVERYONE takes the shaman over a rogue or non-enchanter caster in
pick up groups. I can see where a haste applied to the tanks and the rogues
would end up doing more for the end sum than no rogue and a shaman casting a
group regen spell. My follow up question would be, does the shaman casting
slow spells on dragons and other 60ish mobs even stick? If it does stick
does it really help that much for the total sum damage dealt to your
parties. I like the fact that different levels in this game bring out
positives for a class that didn't exist maybe just 10 levels lower.

But on the other hand, rogues don't get killer puppy dogs that attack
enemies...
