I must agreen with Endurance on this one. He can post whatever he wants as long
as its not in conflict with the rules of the board.

But on the other hand, trying to sell an account violate the EQ rules, and not
only is he trying to sell a nearly worthless account, but doing it in a place
where there is a rather good chance he will be reported for it.
