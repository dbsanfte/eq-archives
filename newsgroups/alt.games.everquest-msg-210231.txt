Warriors have one major advantage over all other classes: the ability to
take damage.  They have more hitpoints and get better use from their AC than
anyone else.  Plus their defensive discipline makes them even more valuable
because they can mitigate damage until the mob gets slowed or healing gets
smoothed out or whatnot.

So in a high-end raiding situation, you absolutely have to have a good
warrior.  For example, my guild leader is a paladin.  He has more hitpoints
than most warriors, having great equipment and over 200AA's.  He can
effectively off-tank adds, but he just cannot be the Main Tank - even with
all of his equipment and AA's, he still will die very quickly compared to
what a warrior could withstand.  (It's a running joke in our guild to call
our guild leader Kenny, as in "Oh no!  They killed Kenny!  You bastards!")

Yes, other classes can out-aggro them pretty easily.  That's why you often
hear our officers yell into the raid channel, "Watch aggro!"  It's the
responsibility of everyone else on the raid to let the Main Tank keep aggro
as much as possible; if anyone else gets aggro, they mob will move out and
kill them, and that can screw up positioning and healing and all sorts of
things.

My two cents.  Other classes have their own advantages and disadvantages, of
course.  But Warriors are the kings of taking damage, and that's what makes
them invaluable.
