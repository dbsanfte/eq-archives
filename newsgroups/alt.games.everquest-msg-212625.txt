huh??  I don't understand.

I've been trying to get my research skills underway (late starter, I'm lvl
25) to get my lvl 24 pet spell (can't seem to find it on any vendor!) - and
I read that the female dark elf smith was supposed be have stuff for
training... can't figure out how to make it work...

clear advice would be appreciated...
