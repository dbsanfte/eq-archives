As a special niche server I can see it being interesting, but it won't
be very mainstream.  I suspect that it can be done faster than 21 days,
but even at 21 days, they will be unable to set foot near at least 2
cities.  I suspect that like I said it will be a druid andor a mage
andor a necro, because summoned plate is better than bronze, and will
dramatically reduce the need to gear up pre 40.  The last time they
opened a virgin server, it was some time between 14 and 16 days that
the first person dinged 50.  Once you've got your core druid/mage team
doing PLing, and your Necro farming cash for vendor acquireable gear,
you'll bring up a monk and a shaman(7-8 days), at which point you'll be
around the 30 day point and have the clerics warriors, enchanters and
rogues in the high 30s low 40s and you'll start gearing up in LGuK and
SolB.  The Necros will continue slaughtering Nobles in Highkeep for
cash, and once you've got 55 or 60 people leveled and geared at 50,
you'll start making runs at either Nag/Vox or Hate/Fear.

I remember how much fun it was starting out on a level field, but I'm
not sure I want to do it again.
