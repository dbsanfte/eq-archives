I suppose it depends on the level of the necromancers in question.  I have
been 65 for far too long to comment on the game below 60, but at 65 an all
necromancer LDoN group can and has one a regular Guk adv, and could probably
do any adventure.  Necromancers are a near self sufficent class, having the
make up of an entire group within their capabilities.  Necromancers can heal
themselves quite well and quickly, have no need for clarity, can provide
better than enchanter haste for their pets, can snare, can root, can
mez/slow undead, and provide 93% rezs.  An all necromancer group places
themselves in the unique position of being able to all fd on a particularly
bad pull.  A necromancer with pet discipline can quickly and reliably single
pull just about anywhere.
