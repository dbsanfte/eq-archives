I've tried the trade channel, I've tried auctioning on EC.  I can't seem to
find a human blacksmith who can make Full Plate armor (the old cultural
stuff, not the new, uber stuff).  If anyone here plays on the Raithe, and
can fill the order, or knows someone who can, please let me know.

Thank you.
