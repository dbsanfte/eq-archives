I can't stand Regal Cinemas. First.. their price tends to be $.50 more
than the other guy. Their presentations tend to be bland. I'm not a
big sound guy.. but when I listen to their speakers I hear nothing
special.. i might as well be at home with the volume turned up. Their
stadium seating is cookie cutter, and their screens tend to be on the
smaller side. And then they top it off by having The Twenty going
while everybody is trying to get seated.

Thankfully, I found a theater in my area that does it right... i
stumbled across something called The Movie Experience. Not sure if its
a chain or whatever.. but the first weekend screens tend to be
gigantor.. the seating is more smoothed out.. and the sound is some of
the best i've heard in a theater. You know its rockin when in Harry
Potter 3 you get the full effect of Hermione's scream as she is
whipped across the camera by the whomping willow and you can feel it
pass from right to left. Loved that. And when they have the sound
cranked.. it can even make the Catwoman trailer almost acceptable.
Well.. nah. On the down side.. if the movie passes to one of the back
screens after a few weeks... it isn't the best in the world. Found
that out with Van Helsing... allthough i doubt anything would have
saved that heh. But... when I absolutely must have the best
presentation without the fuss.. they're my go to guys.

Oh.. and it only costs $9 to Regal's $9.50. Really.. i'd check out
other theaters in your area... there is probably better and cheaper.
