Time for the next in my series of "what about XXX?". :)  Yesterday started
out poorly (I was on vacation for my 26th birthday), but by the end of the
day all was going great.  Husband got his 8th cudgel and I got lucky on a
roll for the urn from Drusella Sathir (cudgel quest crashed the zone :P),
then today he found a copy of PoB real cheap *and* had a successful
combine at researching Malo. :)  Still no Torpor, but even those two is
enough to elicit a Yippee! from me.

So now I have the hardest part of the spirit-wracked cord quest and
goshdarnit if I wouldn't like to get myself some undead dragon
sinew.  Sometime in the next month or so anyhow...angry gob comes first.

Here's what I have read about Juggs:

1) All about level 57
2) tend to be hard to get single
3) hit for only around 171
4) not particularly tough MR, so now that Rak has malo, slow should be a
done deal
5) 1 in 100 drops sinew
6) need 57 enchanter to mez

What I don't know is how many HP they have, and if that "hits for 171" is
accurate.  I read somewhere "don't try to duo until 62 at least"...well,
ok, almost there.  I know that getting to them past something called a
"CHing shroom" (sorry, makes me giggle) is pretty tough too.

Any wisdom to share (particularly on HP)?  If you only had one group, what
would you add to a 62 ranger and shaman?  Obviously we can smack those
things into next leap year if we got them alone in a dark ally, but I
don't think that'll be an option unless someone helps us break it first
and we don't take a break to pee.
