I think that the six people who left for AO have all come back already.
The rest are probably just waiting for their free month to end. As for
your guild, I noticed you didn't say "they have all cancelled their
accounts"...

Really? Damn, I was under the impression that Verant was a non-profit
charity and SoL was being produced solely for the love of their craft.
Thanks for opening my eyes to the sad reality.

That would be a good thing, if it draws the d00dz away. Unfortunately,
it seems that proton decay and the heat death of the universe are more
immediate concerns than the release of NWN.

Hm... And exactly which game with a level cap does not, or will not,
suffer from this?

Not to mention the rumor of Brad McQuaid personally coming to every
player's house and disembowelling them with a butcher's knife, before
urinating on their corpses. That one nearly put me off playing EQ for
