The zone line is not the problem for us!
Personal Vent Ahead:
In the Eastern Wastes when you run to the Iceclad zone with the Rygorr Oracle
and Elites on your tail they return home walking right through the main
entrance to the fort.  PLEASE set up a hot key that you are in trouble and
running the elites to the Iceclad zone!  That way the rest of us have the
"heads up" that your failed kiting will be dropping in on us.  We know exactly
who *did it* when that happens, (duh!).
We usually try to do the fort when no one is around.  But we are happy to
share, especially if we see a lone guy who just "wants to pull a few".
It's particulary frustrating to "share" a camp with someone who pulls
EVERYTHING and then has to zone.  Especially when you don't know WHICH PULLS
are going to work and which ones aren't. 
I'm not even going to MENTION the fact that you should pull your mobs up over
the hill and away from the rest of us.  YES, it IS annoying when your song
falters and your mobs come off on us.  NO, we don't care that you are "trying
to get them back".  Why the hell are you running them around where half a dozen
people are medding anyway?  Whats with that?
I can honestly say I've NEVER seen a druid pulling that kind of crap.  
Ok, end of vent.
