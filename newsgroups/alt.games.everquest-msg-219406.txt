*cry* And here I thought the kids had gone by to school. Eh, well, your
post felt right to me.  I suppose I should thank them, because it provides
me with the opportunity to see the look of slack confusion on average
joe's face when they see what a "real" ranger is capable of.  Or at least,
I like to fantasize about such an occasion.  In groups I've yet to take
any heat if I ended up tanking due to class composition.

BTW, Archerbear...it's "foxeye" or "fox", but not "Foxy". :)  I chose the
name because I love fox's, and Foxeye (as in, an eye of a fox) became my
nickname long before I played EQ...not because I think I'm hot little
thing. :P  But I enjoyed your post, and the post of the guy who called me
Foxy a few threads back, so I'm not turning rabid quite yet.
