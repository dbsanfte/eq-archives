My god, i had again abandoned everquest for months because i happened to get
a RealLife(TM).
New job, new place to live, met a nice girl who moved in with me, birds were
singing and so on and so on...
Oh well.. 2 weeks back GF left umm.. somewhere. Dunno yet where, didn't
leave a note.

For over a week i was miserable and having trouble at sleeping, and because
of that also had trouble at work because of that sleep depravation. Also
started drinking (even heavier than before).

Last week-end i sat before my computer again with a case of beer. Blowed the
dust of the keyboard and pried the mouse of the desk.
For some time i aimlessly surfed the net and skimmed throught news groups
and i suddenly noticed somehow famililar looking icon in my quicklaunch
bar...
Hmm.. Whats this? Looks kinda like blue shield. Ah right! EverQuest! My
former life!

Logged in and selected the server that was selected by default. Fennin Ro.
Oh lookie, a lvl24 chanter with an ugly green robe here. Lets see if i can
still manouver him.
Hmm, camped in LOIO, next to the gobbo caves... Ah... /auction and /ooc. All
the weird acronyms came back to me like i had never been away...

So i tried to recall how to play a chanter. Ofcourse i failed and was
promptly transported to my bind point. Frustrated a bit, collected my items,
made the exp i lost back and logged off...

Monday at work i started feeling the ache to play again, and went to
castersrealm and skimmed few chanter guides and gave a quick glance at the
patch messages i had missed.

After work i went straight onto my machine and started playing. It was still
a bit messy but managed to do a level.
Checked also Antonious Bayle where i recalled to have 35 ranger.
Uh oh.. Hes naked.. Um.. How long did the corpses stay? Oh? Not months?
Dang, i'm not going to try to equip him again. Terrible to play anyway.

Now i think i have got back my skills and levelling quite quickly. currently
almost 29, trying to do 31 tonight. Mmm... No work untill monday, wonder if
i can get good groups so i could get to 34 in sunday night.

I also have completelly got over my ex-gf and can sleep well again and
feeling really brisky in work. No need to drink ungodly amounts of alcohol
every day either.

Thank you Verant for your wonder drug that makes me happy and lets me forget
the miserable RealLife(TM)!

I think there's a lesson to learn here... Never Ever leave your EQ account
alone for more than is absolutely necessary. It takes the edge out of your
skills and it might be hard to get back onto your life if you once lose it!

Cheer, say hello if you see me :)
