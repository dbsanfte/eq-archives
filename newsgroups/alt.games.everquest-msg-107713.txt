Yes it is very difficult to solo, at the higher levels. Warriors have it
rough in that they can't root, heal, or any of that stuff, so your best bet
it to group. There are plenty of good zones, but they require a group for us
tanks (( ... it does suck, it's one reason why i have started a few alts!

Good Luck!
