Remember, charisma is more than just good (or bad) looks.  It's also
personality and other factors.  So a closer scenario would be:

Mithaniel:  Which one?  Ohhh...him...yeah, he's always been an
irritating punk.  A little death-and-resurrection might do him
some good.

Frankly, it's always bugged me that charisma doesn't affect /con,
along with race, religion, and deeds.

Guard:  I'm really not supposed to let Cazic-Thule-worshipping
lizards into the city, but you've bought the boys a lot of beer,
and besides, you're just so darned friendly I can't bring myself
to kill you.  Go on in.  (But if you get in trouble, I never saw ya!)
