Nope. Argentina invaded the Falkland islands and we kicked them out. The
invasion was condemed by United Nations Security Council and we fought to
protect British citizens.

I suggest you read http://www.naval-history.net/NAVAL1982FALKLANDS.htm,
http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/uk/2002/falklands/,
http://www.yendor.com/vanished/falklands-war.html,
http://met.open.ac.uk/group/cpv/falkland.htm for basic facts (might want to
look up some more Argentinian based sources too) or books about it if you
really want to know what happened.

We're not Americans at all, nor do we wish to be. We're strong allies of
America but we have a defensive military, not an offensive one.
