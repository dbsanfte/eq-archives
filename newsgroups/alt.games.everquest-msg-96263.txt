Dungeons, generally.  The problem is that the vast majority of people are 
sheep, and go wherever they see the most people.  You can use this to your 
advantage though, especially if you group with the same people fairly 
regularly.  When you get a good group together, and everyone will be there 
for a couple hours, suggest moving to a nearby dungeonn (or a remote 
dungeon if you have a porter with you).  The old-world dungeons are great 
exp for the risk with all the new weapons and armor.  (When Guk was *the* 
dungeon, a 8/24 weapon with a 75dd proc was uber.)  All three expansions 
have a number of nice dungeons for mid-level characters.  You just have to 
bring a group with you.  
If I were regularly fighting in DL at 40, I would try and convince my 
group to port to EJ and go play in Kaesora or City of Mist, or just run to 
FM and go play in Nurga.  These are all within 10-15 minutes from DL, 
pretty much uninhabited, and much more fun to play in.  
Check out the hunting guide at http://www.eqatlas.com/huntguidelevel.html 
and explore when you can.  See more besides Oasis, LOIO, FM, DL, KC.
