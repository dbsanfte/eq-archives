Kite giants at the giant fort in Frontier Mountains.  That should get you to
your mid 30s.  There are usually several groups there at the front of the fort
pulling giants.  You can snare a giant and pull it out and kite along the north
wall on the flats.  I never ran into another creature there.  You can also
safely med on the flats up the hill here where you kite. Be careful until your
34 about pulling more that one giant.  When there a few groups there, the ones
at the front of the fort can re-pop while you are pulling out.  Once you get
your area DD spell at 34 you can handle two at once, but I would recommend
doing this only when you accidentally pull two, they are a real mana burner
since you (at least i did) would have to snare both and DoT both, but two are
managable.

Regards,
John
