I've been given a quest by a scribe zizwold in east freeport just as i was
playing with leaving. I'm not going to be able to do it until after, and i
was wondering if i should delete the quest, if it would delete
automatically, or if i would still be able to finish the quest. anyone out
there tried betrayal and know what happens to the old quests?
