Poachers in Jaggedpine are level 40 ish, apart from Yrannick Blackguard, are
easy exp, with druid harmony you can single pull and pretty much own the
area there, also griffawns (mostly lb by now), griffons, wisps and giant
anacondas should be good exp also (anacondas have a ton of hp though, I tend
to leave them be).

There is also a nice bard (maybe rogue as well, I forget)item that drops
from Zed Sticklebrush, an illusion half-elf helm (no-drop), that is
apparentley quite rare (I have seen two, one rotted with a bard 20 seconds
away from looting after I sent him a tell, the other was picked up by
another bard I messaged).

I havent fought the Potemeids there yet, but have told they are quite nasty,
so I leave them alone for now.

You can also collect the four named heads for a no drop sigil ring at the
ranger village.

Dont fight in front of the fire, fight in front of the rocks and in front of
the tent to the left of the fire, both the entrance mobs will single pull,
the others will need a lull.

They dont resist much, are ok exp if you kill them in numbers (which is
easy).

Hmm, I just noticed you are a paladin, get the druid to add a dot or so, to
each mob, and they should go down fine (make sure druid snares also).

Good luck.
