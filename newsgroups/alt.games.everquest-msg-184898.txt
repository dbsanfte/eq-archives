Any one of the following (if true) could be part of the reason:

1) Luck
2) Playing during off-peak hours
3) Playing on a less populated server
4) You spend very little time in highly populated areas.
5) You didn't notice it because you weren't trying to zone or open a
door at the time.
6) You're a bard and almost always playing a song.

...and any number of other factors I have not thought of.

Look there is no chance in hell that my ISP is shutting me off until I
happen to cast a spell.  They are just routing packets to the same
place.  The fact that I can always come out of near-LD by performing a
certain action almost certainly proves that my ISP has absolutely
nothing to do with it.

Does it really seem that outlandish that Sony would limit the number
of times it has to update each and every client in a certain zone with
the fact that joe_cleric is sitting on his ass next to the bank?  I
liken it to MPEG movies.  The MPEG coding doesn't update each and
every pixel, each and every frame.  It only updates the ones that
change.  Sony is trying to do something similar, by reducing the usage
of bandwidth for updating people who are judged to be doing very
little, and thus dont need to have their position, direction, and
velocity transmitted, nor their view of others who are not interacting
with them, updated.  They are those pixels that remain the same color
for several frames.  But somehow Sony doesn't always figure out when
the pixel color wants to change.

Now people going LD is another issue, but it certainly may be tied to
this one.  I personally have not found many LD issues, and not any
more than I did before.  But I have found it nearly impossible to
remain online in the bazaar for more than an hour, even after playing
for many hours straight with zero problems...
