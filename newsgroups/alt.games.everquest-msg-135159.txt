Watch it fella! - I ain't "like" that.  (that was a joke ya know)

 If you have a photo of your kids on your desk,

Bull.  Say who ??  I have pictures of guys on my desk!  Last years
golf turnny, my brothers, beer drinking friends etc.
Besides, if you are feeling "guilty", or somehow an "outcast"
(if you are gay with pictures of male lovers on your desk etc),
I hate to say this, but thats the cost of being outside the
bell curve. I'm not being selfish, bullheaded, ot anything
like that, but that nature. Much like some animals, we are
"Pack animals" - we tend to group together with "like" groups.
I personally don't feel guilty about "you" feeling guilty for
being gay (if you are), I just happen to believe that there
are social norms, and there are always people on either end
of the bell curves of social norms, and by virtue of plain old
human nature, people "in" the bell curve are afforded a bit
more "acceptance" than thoes not in the bell curve, and try
as you might, you ain't easily gonna chance human nature!




> Yeah, right.

Study Darwin, and human nature instead of the "package" on the repairman,
and you might just be ok.  If your "whole" identity is based on your
sexual identity (which is a small part of your life), that I'd look at
that first.
