I have similar issues, my real email address is now getting about 30 a
day despite some anti spam mechanisms in place, as I run the mail
server its blatent how they get the addresses for some people though..

example.

If you had a couple say Tom and Sarah (no not my names)
and they had friends say Gavin and Tracey

so you might have

Tom@hostname1.com
Sarah@hostname1.com
Gavin@hostname2.com
Tracey@hostnam2.com

now, given the attempts on my server to access mailboxes that dont
exist..  heres some tricks the spammers use

Tom@hostname2.com
Sarah@hostname2.com
Gavin@hostname1.com
Tracey@hostname1.com

So, they get like 8 for the price of 4..

Once you then combine that with all the other hostnames etc.. You can
see that unless you have a really freaky unique mailbox name, which no
one in the world might have, ever, chances are, you will get caught by
spam, as all domain names are publically listed, and if you have a
tied IP address to them, thats listed too!

Of course, if you ever subscribe to mailing lists, or post bug reports
for software, chances these things have an archive, and even if you
didnt know it, your address maybe listed, as while they may do
something to prevent the senders email, anyone replying may not be so
kind.. so you may get

From: tracey at hostname2 dot com
Subject: something

In a message that tom@hostname1.com wrote....

and thats all it needs

sadly spam databases are huge.. and the longer you have the address
the worse it gets, Ive had mine near only 11 years....
