Half the time I want to be in Wolf Form, I'm not because I don't want to
keep both WF and SoW memmed and I don't want to take the grief for not
passing out SoW like it is my sole purpose for existance.  I will often solo
just so I can mem what I want.  And darn right, I am going to tell the
passing begger that it is not memmed.

BTW, how many Druids do you see running around begging for Clarity?
