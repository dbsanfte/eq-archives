I dont think that racial tension has anything to do with it. But being a 
rogue, this may be the reason that the guards regarded you as KOS.

Barbarians are devoted to Tribunal of Justice, at least shamans are, and 
as such only the Barbarian rogues are accepted within Halas.

Others may have a better explanation, but i think this it the reason

Best regards
