Simpler yet, given that he's using /ho to create the original hotkey:
Having placed that hotkey in his hotkey bank somewhere, he can just
right-click on the hotkey button itself to open it up for editing.

It is true, of course, that the /ho command in fact creates a "social"
button somewhere and he could go find that, or could create his hotkey
in the first place by going to the socials window, but since he's using
/ho (/hotkey), might as well just stick with it.

Hm, it does make me wonder what happens if you use /hotkey and all 100
social buttons are in use?  Maybe I'll try that sometime on a fresh alt
just to see.
