    Free damage for soloing, and the stats are very good. Considering how
easy this epic is, I can't see why a shaman would skip it.

> Enchanter epic is out dated.

    Again, what would you have the enchanter get that has equivalent or
better stats? Droppables are getting closer in quality, but aren't quite
there yet. I'd say this is just at the edge of effort versus reward being
positive.

> Wizard Epic is nice but not essential.

    Wizards would beg to differ. WIZ epic is huge. Free rune with mana regen
for a high-aggro class? Invaluable, especially at those levels where the
tanks haven't caught up in weaponry to a wizard's spells.

> Ranger epic is still good for people not in an uber guild.

    And those in one, too. The effect also has some ATK with it, which helps
whether you use archery or not and which can give a better DPS boost than
just an improved offhand ratio.
