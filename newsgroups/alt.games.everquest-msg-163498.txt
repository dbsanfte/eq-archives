As I hunt in Oasis solo, I have found a way to render mobs powerless.
Mummys hitting for a whopping 5 points of damage.

Start by single mezzing the target.  Then a smooth Laguid pace to really
slow them down in life.
Then relax them with a cool ebbing strength, a dash of Disempower to really
give the drink a kick, then Memblur to make it think nobody is there.
Let the mez fade, light nuke, get my pet involved, then NUKE NUKE NUKE,
loot.
Hardest hit I saw was 5 points.  It is almost not sporting.  But I like it.
