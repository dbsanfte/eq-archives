Nice little site promoting women's rights and self defense.

False. 

"Murder rates decline when either more women or more men carry
concealed handguns, but a gun represents a much larger change in a
woman's ability to defend herself than it does for a man. An
additional woman carrying a concealed handgun reduces the murder rate
for women by about 3 to 4 times more than an additional man carrying a
concealed handgun reduces the murder rate for men. "

-John Lott

"Police play an extremely important role in reducing crime, though
they almost always arrive at the crime scene after the crime has been
committed. When confronted by a criminal, passive behavior,
particularly for women, is not the wisest course of action. Indeed,
the probability of serious injury from a criminal confrontation is 2.5
times greater for women offering no resistance than for women
resisting with a gun."

-John Lott

He's just about the only one who's done any in-depth studies about
guns laws and crime. The rest seem to use feelings. :p Feelings are
fine when you;re in love. NOT when you're trying to protect yourself.




Ok... So tell me what YOU would do to protect your family? I'm
actually curious. How would you stop a home intrusion? How would You
stop a carjacking? And please, don't say that that sort of thing never
happens where YOU live. It does. Shit happens. How do you deal with
it?
