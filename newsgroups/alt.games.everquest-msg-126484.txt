Humm here is an interesting little site.

I'm sure that I'm using it out of context (Or at least not as intended)
but how many children would reach adulthood with the death penalty for
the followng :

E. Sins against one's parents. 
1. Cursing a parent. Leviticus 20:9 Exodus 21:17 
2. Physically abusing one's parent. Exodus 21:15 
3. Disobeying parents. Deuteronomy 21:18-21 

At least they demand 2 witnesses "so that there is no error"

Very christian :-/
