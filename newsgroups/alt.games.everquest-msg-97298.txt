Hi all...been playing EQ about since the beginning, but today am seeming to
have trouble logging on.  I keep getting the error 1017 message today
although nothing has changed since I was on for about 12+ hours yesterday
(and really accomplished nothing LoL).  I upgraded to DSL about 30-45 days
ago, but EQ has worked fine for me ever since until today.  Don't think it's
my ISP as I can access newsgroups and internet sites.  I check on everlore
and it shows only 1 person per server, but I thought I read somewhere no one
could track EQ server counts any longer.  Anyway, if anyone has any
thoughts, I am all ears (however, not an elf!).  I am not even disinclined
to delete all files and reload if that's "really" what it would take.
So....consider this an "Alexa yells for help from straight in front of you!"
Thanks in advance for any insight and the time it takes to help =)
