Personally, I think it was a rather good idea.  No, it's not exactly
threatening SoE.  Druids, Bards, Necros, and Wizards will still solo the
crap out of anything out there while the Warriros are sitting around doing
nothing.  However, it will force SoE to at least acknowlege that pure melee
was unhappy about the way things were.  That's better than nothing.
