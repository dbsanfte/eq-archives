Its the price you pay for improvement. 

Figure it this way, $9.99 per month is a now outdated price we won't
see again for an mmorpg of this quality or even below (hello AO) So,
even with missing part of a day its still a bargain at $9.99 and
figure that for $9.99 currently they are greatly improving the game.

I'd frankly pay $9.99 for all the improvements going in with just this
one patch alone (except I want to be able to drop money =/ ) so for 15
copper I'm getting a bargain. No subscription service is that cheap
which you can more or less use 24/7 at best.

My cable internet connection is about 35 bucks a month for unlimited
very good use, would I pay $9.99 for it instead as a different plan if
it was down a couple times a month for 5 hours instead? You bet I
would.
