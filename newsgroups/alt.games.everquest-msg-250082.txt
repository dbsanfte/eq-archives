I am not sure wandering npcs would be a good idea.  Perhaps something
more along the lines of the delivering mail quest.  Hail an npc in WK
to get a Qeynos portal token; click the Qeynos book with the token to
get some reward. Hail an npc in Jagged Pine to get a token used for
the EF book.  Etc.  

The real problem is what sort of reward should you give?  Consider
most new players can use bazaar sold silks and furs to easily purchase
gear that they wouldn't see drop for 30 levels; coming up with an
appropriate reward is difficult..
