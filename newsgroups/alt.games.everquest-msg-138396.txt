Anyone get Hits Mode to work exclusive of melee filters?

I can't get Hits Mode to work as it seems to me that it should. My attempts go like this:

Make new chat window

Name it My Hits or whatever

Select Hits Mode 

Select My Hits filter


>>>Dont Work<<<

The following does work:

Make new chat window

Name it My Hits or whatever

Select Melee

Select My hits filter

>>>Works<<<

So I have a solution, but it bugs me that It doesn't "seem" to work the way intuition
would indicate that it should. Am I missing something?

Comments?
