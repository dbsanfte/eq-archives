Always has, always will. 
I've spent most of my exp time since 57 root dotting in Chardok, with
the occasional charmed pet before the pet changes and lots more
charmed pets after. Yes, it's dull as hell, but it beats the snot out
of the exp I could get in any group that would take a druid. So, I no
longer do generic pickup groups and soloing in general has grown on
me, as long as it doesn't involve quadding.
BTW, absolutely nothing beats having a dire charmed black unicorn as
your pet for hunting blue geonids and green things with pelts in WL.
*Nothing*.
