I found a list of approved video card on www.everquest.com.  It seems
the skipped over the FX 5700.  I picked up an FX 5200 and that works
Well at least it doesn't crash to the desktop.  I does have an
appearance problem but I'll put it in a different post.
I tried both loading the drivers after directx and the other way.
Didn't make any difference for that card.  I think either that card
was flakey or it was left off the approved list for a reason.

thanks for all the input.  very useful.
