I was hunting giants in great divide the other night and started hearing
people shouting "&543*^ gnomes!!".  Since I play a gnome, I asked what
they're talking about but only got a bunch of bs.  I never saw gnome npcs in
gd only dwarfs, and I don't think *I* was causing anyone any trouble.  You
think they were ignorant enough to mistake coldain for gnome, or were they
just trying to make trouble?
