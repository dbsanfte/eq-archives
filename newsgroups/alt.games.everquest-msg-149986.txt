Interestingly enough - max range of a bolt spell with
an extended range item on is very close to the stop
chasing range of many mobs.  It's possible that if you
step just inside of the extended range of the bolt, you'll
still be outside of range of the mobs on the other side
of the one you're nuking.

I something I've seen before is mobs in Kunark that I pull
with a bolt as they are moving away, sometimes move out of
chase range after the bolt fires, but before it hits - and
they just keep walking away, even though I got the damage 
message.
