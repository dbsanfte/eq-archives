Actually both.

You take 214ish getting flung into the air, and 100 coming down.

Though it's kinda wonky on how much falling damage it does.  I've used it,
as noted to jump onto stuff.  As one might expect, you don't take as much
damage falling if you land on something higher than you started (since
you're not falling as far).  But sometimes it doesn't work that way.

zero-zero eject = 100 points... just about always.
Land in deep water = no damage. (launched myself off an ice flow and stepped
forward, landing in the iceclad ocean... no damage).

In EFP, resist the spell, and take about 1500 points from the guard I
accidentally winged with it.

In NFP, blast myself to the top of a 2nd story building = take about 35
points (as I recall)
In NFP, blast myself to the top of a 13 foot wall = 150! (huh?  I landed
higher than I started, why would I take MORE damage... dunno, but this has
happened more than once with similar jumps).

In EW, took like 45 getting to the top of the rock next to the Thurgadin
waterfall... and another 15 landing atop the waterfall.

Every MOB I've hit took 100 from the landing.

Actually, when I got winged by the spell when hitting a giant with it... he
took 100 on landing. I took 154 (IIRC) ... but I landed on the side of the
hill... of course he did too.

So I think it's a special kind of fall damage.
