Excuse me, but I think you're talking out your ass.  Yes, Verant's engine 
is old and outdated, but it's also in a game that has been released for 3 
years now.  Comparing the latest, greatest fragfest to EQ is like 
comparing the Boeing-727 to the Boeing-777.  Sure, they're both jet 
planes primarly used in passenger service, but that's about where the 
similarities end.  
The main difference is that there are a very limited number of models in 
the average fragfest compared to EQ, and that EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER in EQ 
can and will look different.  It's one thing to have 100 copies of the 
same character running around in a zone compared to 100 characters made up 
of 30 basic character models, all with very different textures, on all 
visable surfaces.  Now throw in that all of the different models have 
completely different combat and spell effects (compared to one basic 
effect for each weapon) and figure out which game is doing the most work.
