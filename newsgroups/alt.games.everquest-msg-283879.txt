Omg - You only open your mouth to change feet!

I know the capabilities of a Cleric better than you do, I can
guarantee you - going on your limited grasp of what other characters
can do, anyway.  Have YOU ever played a Necro??  I bet not.  Just
accept it - they *do not* NEED a Cleric, trust me AND the others who
have told you the same thing.  They can solo in zones where your
sorry-ass Cleric would be reduced to pounded armour scraps if you
tried it! Have you even tried ANY other class than a cleric?  I'd
doubt it. 

One more thing  the Necro isn't even my main character, nor is it a
particular favourite, but such a blatantly short-sighted view of a
class, as you just demonstrated with your incredibly ill-informed,
antagonistic post, just had to be corrected.
