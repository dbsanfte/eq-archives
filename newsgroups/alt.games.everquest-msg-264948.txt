In it's defense:
a) Some people find it boring, some don't. I happen to be a 'don't'. 
Some people find EQ boring, some don't. I happened to be a 'don't' there 
too. Some people find CoH boring, some don't. I happen to be a 'do' there.
b) Since you can change jobs, the need for alts is greatly reduced (you 
only need alts if you want another race, and frankly, race rarely has a 
massive affect on what you can succeed at. I've grouped with Galkan 
Black mages and Taru Warriors, and they are usually better at their job 
(having to work harder to be good) than the Taru blm's and elvaan cookie 
cutter war types. In point of fact I prefer changing jobs to making an 
alt, because I don't have to run around in Valkum getting the bits for 
my subjob quest, deal with doing level cap quests again, etc...
I do have an alt... $1 a month for 75% more storage is certainly worth 
it to me as a crafter/packrat (Another reason for changing jobs instead 
of alting: my main has spent nearly 400000 gil on storage upgrades for 
the moghouse and personal carry capacity. )
