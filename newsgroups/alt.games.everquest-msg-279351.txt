Yep.  I'll probably never get PoP flagged, see the interiors of OoW, or
very far into the GoD continent.  Precisely for this reason, I cannot
justify purchasing DoN nor the upcomming DoD or whatever it is.  That's
three expansions, possibly four, the bulk of which we'll never get to
experience. Why should I shell out for two more we can ever only skirt
around the edges of?

On the other hand, I don't want to feel like I'm being given handouts
by the SOE team because I can't spend every waking moment not in class
or at work playing.  These people who play a hell of a lot, the
ammounts I wish I could play, really what other reward in life are they
gonna get?

I'm just saying, that's why I don't complain about it too much.  I was
just piping up that there is a demoraphic in EQ who have
responsibilities that may prevent us from ever seeing raid content, is
all.
