Other than upping your MR, as someone else mentioned, maybe you could
fight him further inside. If I remember, there's only one mob in that
dead end corridor off to the right after you get up the ramp. Fight
him at the end in one of the alcoves and maybe your pet won't path far
enough to hit anything else. 

Last option might be to IVU past the undead and try the golems
instead. You can probably single pull if you set up by the fence and a
55 necro should be able to take those out.
