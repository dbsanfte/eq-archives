Not really ;)  Take smithing for example... go to the Freeport dock and fish
for a while.  (Note you will be building up your fishing skills also)  After
an hour or two of fishing, you should have a couple of fish and a lot of
rusty daggers and mildewy sandals (LOL, just kidding)  But you will get a
good number of rusty daggers.  Go to your nearest smithy supply place, and
buy some sharpening stones (very cheap... coppers, but I can't remember the
exact price right now.  I haven't smithed in ages.)  Sharpen up those lovely
rusty daggers and watch your smithing skill zoom... and for relatively
little money.  By the time you trivial out on that method, you will probably
be bored with this and feel like busting heads... so go hunt skeletons or
something (don't know your level, so maybe those are too little for ya)
These will also drop rusty weapons, you're getting your fighting "fix", and
by the time you're bored with fighting you should have a nice little
collection.  I flip-flop like that all the time, and try and combine my
fighting with my "harvesting" of whatever I need for the current skill I'm
working on.  That's my approach to EQ... fwiw
