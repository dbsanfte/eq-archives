I'd love it! lessee, guide gets on to 41 petitions. Petition one: Immawanker
is stealing all our kills and is swearing to everyone in shout.

Guide goes over, finds that Immawanker is a poster child for abortion, gives
him a 7 day time out and goes to petition two.

Petition 2 thru 41 are about Immawanker. delete delete delete.

Petition 41 my body is stuck past a zone line and I can't get
it....*Appears* Hi Guide Helpuwikmyfreetime here, how may I help you?


Now if they were all petty petitions...well isn't that just a guides day
anyway? ;)
