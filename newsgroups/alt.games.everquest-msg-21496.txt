When they open the Plane Underfoot, Ill work on returning my faction, if it
becomes necessary.  The exp in The Hole (with a group of 6) is phenominal.

I use stun, but not very often...My 'chanter happens to be very VERY good at
her job and I have yet to piss her off with the way *I* play my cleric. I
use stun if I am hunting with a chanter I dont know quite as well.  (BTW my
chanter also happens to be my wife, so the problem of not knowing her target
is eliminated, since she tells me what shes casting on and the new "D"
feature of immediate interruption makes it even easier.

That would be one of the situations in which I generally put up the third
stun (and it is usally Stun).  I am usually down only 20% (sitting at 80%)
after a pull.  Normally when we pull for exp (not camping items), we have 5
or 6 mobs parked while we fight one.  In Chardok, this is normally one or
two 51+ templars, a couple golems, and then hall trash for the final
mob...even the chanter finishes above 50% mana.  So, we do well.

The CHeal is for my warrior (SK and Pally also) and they are usually fully
buffed and I dont cast it from anything over 2 and a half bubbles of health.
Again, with "D" interrupting casts instantly the time to cast is irrelevant.
If things get ugly I can stop casting and drop remedy on them for fast
heals.  The group dynamic is a bit different for me than for you.  Also,
having C2 all the time makes a big difference also.

Again, the group dynamic is different, we have found ourselves (from 51 or
so ) in areas where normally people take two groups.  I have never used
both, myself, but I have been close a couple times and feel safer having it
up as a backup.  I usually use the divine barrier first and save divine aura
(On occasion, I will drop the divine barrier and put up gate, but that is
*usually* reserved for groups I am not familiar with).  Havent noticed a
regen on it, so if it does have one...it is negligible. I dont use /q to me
it is an exploit (that DOESNT mean I hate you for it...I just choose not
to...No need for a Feature vice Exploit discussion here, its been a good
thread so far).  BTW,  I dont expect you to change the way you play just
because i happen to play differently.  Being in the room with my very own
chanter when I allows for us Both to play a little differently than others
do especially since we rarely group without each other.
