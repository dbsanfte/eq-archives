One thing I have noticed is that the different EQ packages (Trilogy,
original, Luclin, etc.) install EQ in different places in some cases.
I don't remember the exact sequence of events, but after installing
everything to bring me up to Luclin EQ was installed in both
C:\Program Files\EverQuest and C:\Program Files\Sony\Everquest. Also,
if I'm not mistaken, didn't the original EQ install in C:\EverQuest?

Anyway, this is not a solution, but may at least help point you in the
right direction.
