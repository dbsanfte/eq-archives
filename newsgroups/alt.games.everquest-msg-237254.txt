So like I turned my book in on one of my alts. He's level 19, basically
harmless if you ask me. Not to mention that I have yet to whack another
player.
 Yet some 56 Druid begins ripping me in tells explaining how people like me
have ruined EQ.

 My responses were simple. I said " I just wanted to try something
challenging". Then I told him to "Have a Nice Day, your 56, I doubt I can
hurt you"

 For the next 10 minutes the guys is telling me all sorts of stuff about how
stupid I am, what a loser I am, and say's he is going to make my life so
miserable that I will cuss, and the GMs will boot me.  Go figure. I guess
the guy don't know that I have patience, tact, and really don't get fired up
to easy. Guess I should have told him to turn in his book, and come kick my
ass if he felt so strong about it.

 Bottom line, PK is part of the game. So I took the Red Pill, he took the
Blue pill. No big deal to me.

 Should I just write it off to the fact that the guys a Druid, or do people
really get upset when someone takes the Red Pill ?
