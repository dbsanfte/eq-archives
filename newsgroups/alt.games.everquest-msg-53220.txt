Woah, those numbers you quoted for Augmentation are for a level 50
chanter.  Here's the spell description, straight from spdat:

******
Augmentation
Increase Attack Speed for between 22% (L29) to 28% (L52) in 270 ticks
Increase Agility from 19 (L29) to 30 (L50)
Increase Armor Class (AC) from 6 (L29) to 9 (L50)
Decrease Stamina Loss by 2 (L29)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mana Required: 90
Spell Duration: 270 ticks (27.0 minutes)
******

And this is Alacrity:

******
Alacrity
Increase Attack Speed for between 34% (L24) to 40% (L36) in 110 ticks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mana Required: 115
Spell Duration: 110 ticks (11.0 minutes)
******

Now, the agi and stamina from Augmentation are worthless, imo, so at level
30 we're looking at 22% haste and 6ac versus 37% haste.  You only have to
look at the price of melee gear to know which one of those is more
valuable.  You couldn't give away a 6ac belt, but a 15% haste belt
(if such a thing existed) would probably run a couple k.

Also, well, you might as well get used to that 11 minute haste timer.  
You're stuck with it until Swift Like The Wind at 49, which lasts a
whopping 15 minutes.  There's no Augmentation upgrade until 56, so in a few
levels you'll have no choice but to switch to the pure haste line.
