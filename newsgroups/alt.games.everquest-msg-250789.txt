ok, normally i would let that one slide but since i like you :p

I assume you are talking income instead of assets An economy is the sum
total of all goods produced.. If you can encourage those evil high achievers
to make more (and they are by FAR the easiest to change the habits of,
usually downwards 8/) then your total economy grows. It is also notable that
once goods are made they are not lost they are transferred. While the work
may be fufilling you will gain little stuff by working for a poor man. Rich
men everywhere make it far easier for a normal man to gain a goodly amount
of stuff for his efforts at pleasing them. If you can encourage more people
to enter the evil high achiever category, or convince people already in the
evil high achiever category to redouble there efforts and produce even more
,then your economy goes up !

It is a basic economic truth and the one the left has so much trouble
dealing with . The more even you try and slice the pie among everyone the
less pie there is overall. This is why all socialist and communist policies
fail. People have this really nasty tendency to stop working and producing
stuff the higher the percentage of stuff you take from them. Now if you are
trying to maximize total assets seized from the evil high achiever category
thats a diffrent story. You would carefully try diffrent tax rates and see
exactly how much stuff you could steal from the evil high achievers before
they slowed down. At some rate you will maximize the total amount of stuff
you can steal and then stick with it(say at 23% it is just right, you notice
that at both 22% and 24% you end up with less total stuff stolen). If you
wish to be particularly nasty you can discriminate between peoples. Perhaps
you have to lower the rate on the elderly because they are easily
discouraged from continuing working. Perhaps white males are overly
energetic and you can steal more of there stuff before they stop producing.
Maybe to maximize your stuff seizure females should be lightly taxed from
18-35 but heavily taxed after 35. Maybe diffrent ethnic persuasions should
be taxed diffrently, those mexicans sure seem to work hard maybe we can tax
more stuff from them.
