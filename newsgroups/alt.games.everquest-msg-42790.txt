I remember my first "Chanter Rush" when I was at the Sarnak fort at about
level 21.  Overpull ( pulled 4 ) and then 2 popped for 6 angry Sarnaks.  We
had a full group, I think, and it was looking like a TPW.  The leader never
called for a retreat so I just kept mezzing, tashing, stunning, etc, and we
killed them all with no losses.  I don't think any one of us had over 2 bubs
of health and we were all OOM at the end.  ( this is in response to the
first paragraph that I snipped )

I have the normal:
/g *** Mezzing < %t > ***
/g *** < %t > has been Mezzed, you break it, you buy it! ***

I have an assist macro, but I don't announce my assist to the group with my
chanter.

For now, when the puller is coming back, I hit F# to target him / her and
then hit my assist to get on their target.  If they pull more than 1, I run
towards the mobs as they train in so I can see which on is targeted ( by the
blinking name ) and then target another and start mezzing.  If the puller
picked up something that is harder than the the one they have targeted, I
will target the harder one and hit this macro:

/g *** Switch target to: %t  ---  Harder Mob! ***

and then start mezzing the others.  With the group I've been playing with
lately, when not camping Pyzjn, the puller / tank is the best player I have
ever grouped with and he almost always knows what he is bringing back and
switches to the appropriate target without me having to say anything.

As you start getting higher in level, it is the Chanter that calls the next
mobs in a group.  He is the one who knows which Mob is about to break mez,
he probably knows how they all con, he knows which one(s) he has tashed and
slowed, etc, so he is the one that picks the target.  I have a key set up,
but I've only used it in one group so far:

/g *** < %t > is about to break mez, and is the next target.  Assist me,
taunt, and tear 'em a new one.

I also have some hotkeys set up for other spells that I have cast.  The one
I use the most is my /g *** < %t > has been SLOWED ***

I don't call out when I haste ( alacrity ) someone - they know it and that's
really all that matters.  I don't call out my Tashes, because once a
situation is under control ( and sometimes before ) I am tashing.  Expect
all mobs to be tashed except maybe ones that are blue to the whole party.
That may change as I get higher, but with my current group, there isn't a
lot of spellcasting.

I'm still learning, no doubt, and hope some of you higher leveled chanters
can throw out some tips.
