Druid CH didn't make clerics obsolete because clerics do not live by
CH alone. The real value of a cleric is healing flexibility. CHeal,
fast heal, heal over time, divine arbitration, group heals, and
resurrection when all else fails. Neither of the other priest classes
comes close to that much utility.

A druid or a shaman may be a decent stand-in for a cleric when one can
not be found, but I've never found myself hurting for groups because
they already had a druid or shaman.
