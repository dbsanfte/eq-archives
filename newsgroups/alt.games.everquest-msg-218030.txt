Perhaps it came down to our techniques sucking, but I found Druid-Cleric 
to be a somewhat poor combo. Mind you, this was before I learned to 
charm animals, so perhaps fear-kiting with a cleric, or just the 
availability of a cheap Complete Heal for a charmed PoP pet would make 
it a more viable duo.

Now, Cleric-Cleric... Maybe I don't have much imagination, but I really 
can't see that one working very well at all, unless both are heavily 
geared for melee.
