If can you forage, then make fruit and berry juice and you'll never
have to buy milk or water again.

Players will buy Heady Kiolas. May seem like they aren't selling, but
when someone buys them they will usualy want several stacks. Or make a
few backpacks full of Heady Kiolas and hang out in the Upper Guk
Spider room. They'll sell.
