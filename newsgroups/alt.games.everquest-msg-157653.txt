As long as so many other folks have weighed in on this, I'll go
ahead and post my $.02 as well.

You are trying to become part of a group that relies on fairly
tight organizational discipline with well-defined leadership as
one of their most powerful tools to achieve their goals.  You
are right to wonder if challenging the guild leadership while
on probation has compromised your status.  If you really want
to be a part of that particular guild, you'd probably be well
served by communicating your understanding of your error and
your desire to overcome whatever difficulty it might have
created to a sympathetic officer, if you know of one.  If the
guild is using a formal or semi-formal probationary process
you're probably gonna need someone to champion your cause when
the officers and guildleader gather to decide whether to keep
you on the team or not.

Good luck,
