Want to take him down several times in the weeks to come for the fusible ore
quest for myself and friends. At the moment, I have a halfling Brell's rogue
overlooking the edge of the pit. I've watched for days, and I have yet to
see Master Yael up, though Nortlav has been up the last few days now.

A few questions:

Do they really both spawn that close to each other?
Any issues with aggroing Norlav when doing Master Yael?
Still a 7 day timer?

Any general advice? Hopefully will be two well balanced groups of 53+ -
probably average level of 57 or 58 or there abouts.
