That might be the purpose of US Army Rangers, but it sure as damn
isnt the purpose of the EQ Ranger by my understanding. Rangers are
the light guerilla "tree hugger nazi" toughs of the Druids.

Warriors are the invaders, the army, the defense. Rangers are the
defenders of the forest. They are like paladins for nature lovers.
They are the defenders of Tunare and Karana, the warrior priests,
the Warders of the true priesthood, the Druids.

Of course, I was raised a surefall ranger, but that always struck
me as a pretty strong theme; the only reason it might seem they are
the reccie squad for the wood elves would be because the worship
of druids and Tunare is as deeply ingrained into their culture as
Innoruuk is into the Tier'Dal.

As such the Halfling ranger squad seems pretty understandable given
the rise of bloody kithicor and their increasing incursions into
nektulos. Looks like rivervale is getting militant about treehugging
to me.

Good for them! ;)
