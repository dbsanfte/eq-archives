I would like to get my 25th level ranger transferred from Quellious to
Tunare with all his items intact.  Obviously, this isn't *directly* allowed.
My question is, if I pay to transfer to the Legends server with all
items....then tell Verant that I don't like it and want to transfer
back....will they ONLY let me transfer back to Quellious?....or would I be
allowed to transfer back to any blue server?  (i.e. Tunare)
