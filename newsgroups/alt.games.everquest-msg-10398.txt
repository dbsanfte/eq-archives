Dear All,

I have a weird disconnection issue, but only on one computer, and only when
i zone. First let me tell you my setup:

I have 3 computers wired in a local 10 Mbit/s LAN.

The 1st computer is a mere P200. This computer is equiped with 128 Mb
Memory, Windows 2000 SP2, and with 2 LAN adapters. One is connected to the
LAN, the other is connected to a Cablemodem, supporting a downstream of 512
kbit/s and an upstream of 128 kbit/s. Internet Connection Sharing is
installed, as well as BlackIce Defender as a firewall, which has ALL Verant
IP adres ranges as "trusted". Basicly all this computer does is serve as an
Internet Gatewat for the other 2 computers.

Computer Number 2:
AMD Duron 800 Mhz, 192 Mb, Diskspace-a-plenty,Geforce 2 MX, 3com LAN
Adapter, SB Live!, CDrom and CDWriter. Installed Operating system is Windows
2000, SP2. This comp is connected to the LAN with a 5 meter UTP CAT5 cable.
This is my main computer, on which i play Everquest the most. Except for a
few sound-related issues and the character-saved hang issue that a lot of
Window2000 users seem to have, i experience no problems at all when I play
everquest. Zoning goes smoothly and fast. No lag, great ping, so no
problems. Disconnections during gameplay rarely happen. Maybe twice a month
at max.....and i play almost every day. The swapfile on this computer is 384
Mb, and fixed to that size.

Coputer Number 3: The tricky one....
This is Compaq Armada E500 Laptop. It is Equiped with a Intel PIII 500 Mhz,
128 Mb of memory, and ATI Rage Pro Mobilty Graphic Chip (which perfoms quite
adequate!), and also Windows 2000 SP2. I have approxx. 1 Gbyte of free space
left, with a fixed swapfile of 384 Mb. This is the computer with the
problem. approxx 7 out of 10 times i get disconnected when i zone. But ONLY
when i zone. Like the other computer there are no LAG related issues, great
ping times, etc. Disconnections while playing (LinkDead) are just as rare as
on my main machine. This machine uses a Xircom Realport 10/100 Ethernet
adapter. This one has a 10 meter cable to the hub, so i can comfortably sit
on the couch in the livingroom.


So i'm faced with 2 different computers, but the same OS on it. One computer
works perfectly, the other doesn't. I have been thinking of a faulty cable,
but since i experience no other problems, and ingame connection seem to be
just great, i do not expect that to be it. The Cablemodem is perfect, my
cable service is quite good these days, and i haven't had a disconnection
for months. Even when my wife surfs the net while I play there is no problem
with Lag at all! I'm located in the Netherlands, and my average ping to the
Veeshan server is between 150 en 250. The average packetloss it somewhere
between 0 and 4%

I have tried changing the datarate to 7.0, but it does not seem to solve
this problem. I have heard suggestions about increasing the swapfile to 512
Mb or even more...

Also, of course, I send this problem to Verant Support. Their response was
quick and swift:

"I'm sorry to report that we do not support Laptops. The game was not
designed for Laptops, and we are unable to help you at this point"

So i'm stuck. Verant can't help me, and i don't know where to look. I think
it might have something to do with the LAN configuration on the Laptop. All
machines are configured the same though, with IP adresses in the 192.168.0.x
range, and 255.255.255.0 as a subnet.

I was wondering if anybody here can shine a Greater Lightstone on this
issue, and help me out. If you need to mail me, please be aware of the
NOSPAM part in my e-mail adres ;)

Thanx in advance,

Maarten
