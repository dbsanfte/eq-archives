Extra mana regen for the Paladin at higher (Druid) levels, and
regen/damageshield/DoTs are all *very* big helps for winning
fights faster and lowering downtime.  Even the Druid's big STR
buffs are a big help by boosting the Paladin's ATK rating,
which for some reason is always annoyingly low for Paladins.

And never underestimate the value of having Evac always at
hand...  Besides salvaging situations that have gone bad
and avoiding a CR, it really adds to your ability to
say, "not sure if we can handle this mob, but what the hell,
never hurts to try...", since you've got an almost guaranteed
escape hatch if you've bitten off more than you can chew.
