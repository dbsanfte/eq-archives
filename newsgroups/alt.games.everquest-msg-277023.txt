D&D certainly had a large influence, although I doubt whether, if it 
hadn't existed, the invention of adventure and CRPG games would have 
been much delayed.  And we might have been spared some of the irrelevant 
D&D tropes that were incorporated into many games just because it was 
there.

What game is this in which the rules have been changed to allow players 
to pay more for better cars?

Was that car racing game a current game in which the rules have been 
changed, or a hypothethical future game?  If the latter, your claim 
above about "changing the rules as it went on" is false.

How can you 'change the rules by stealth' by talking about possible 
rules a future game may have?

In other words, a bunch of hypotheticals.

Well, a large proportion of the anti-MS 'findings' have been pretty 
moronic.

And it seems unlikely that MS would alienate audiences by introducing 
something like this to a game that ran without it.  When they could just 
as easily run two games, or even two servers with different rules.
