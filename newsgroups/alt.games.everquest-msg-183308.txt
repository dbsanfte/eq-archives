Since I got EverQuest (and at the same time, started playing Half Life
- Counterstrike, which the problem has also cropped up in) I've
noticed that the areas not lit by 'natural light' (tunnels, inside
buildings, etc) have been incredibly dark, so much so that I haven't
been able to see any detail in shadowy areas.

My graphics card seems to have two settings under window for
brightness/contrast levels, there's a desktop brightness which deals
with any windowed programs, and an 'overlay brightness' which deals
with anything set to fullscreen mode. 

This means that EverQuest is controlled by the overlay brightness
setting...the big problem is, it just doesn't give the brightness I
need and doesn't deal with the areas I can't see that well.

I noticed the problem the most while playing with my new Froglok
(Morglok on the Fennin Ro server). In fullscreen mode it's so dark I
thought I was actually inside a cavern, however then I switched to
windowed mode and suddenly realised I was in the middle of a vast
cliffy swamp, with skies miles above.

Okay down to my question...would this be a graphics card issue (I have
an old ATI Rage 32MB card). I have in-game gamma set to 100% but it
doesn't appear to make a difference. Anybody have any suggestion,
because right now it's so extreme I'm getting eyestrain from playing
the game. I'd play in windowed mode, but that seems to slow the game
down and does some weird things to the graphics sometimes.
