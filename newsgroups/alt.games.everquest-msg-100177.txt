Um, no.  I *wish* it worked this way.  It *should* work this way.  But
unfortunately it doesn't work this way.

There's no way to set a chat channel as the default place your typing
will go if you just hit enter and begin.  Not at the moment, anyway.
/Channel only works for the old things, like /say or /ooc.

However, if everyone in your party has your raid channel as their
number 1 channel, you *can* use the shortcut of:

; <message>

(a semicolon, a space, then your message)

Only works for channel 1 though.
