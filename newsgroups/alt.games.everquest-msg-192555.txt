Don't know about researching spells but my 57 shaman fails about 20 to 30%
of the time when I try and make sow potions and they have been trivial to
him since around level 32 or so.  I refuse to sink a huge amount of Plat
(and time) into other spells.. some of which can eaisly cost over 100pp pre.
If the purpose of all these failures isn't just to consume a players time
then why dosn't Sony get real and quite all that fail crap once a spell
become trivial...  hell I only have a BA in Biology but I NEVER fail when I
run "trivial" lab tests at work!  Go figure!
