We already get an insta-cast "scaled down" CHeal once a day.  But, if
we're gonna keep up with the Joneses, we obviously need a BL-style
pet:  the Squire.  And, of course, a complementary class-AA skill
that converts your Squire to a Greater Squire, complete with coconuts
(prerequisite would be the AA horse, of course).
