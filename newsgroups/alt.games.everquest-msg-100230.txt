I also have noticed that at lvl 40 in OT and FM both I am getting roughly
half the xp I was getting prior to the end of  hell levels.  Makes me wonder
if the class penalty is not back or if they have just made every level from
40 on the equivalent of a hell level.  Whatever it is that is happening it
is certainly not an improvement and certainly not what we were led to
believe it would be.
