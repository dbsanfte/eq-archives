   My problem is that I'm having a hard time paring down my spell line up to
just 8.  I mean I always always always have Celestial memmed, and Superior
and
Complete heal, and also root.  I usually have my biggest nuke memmed.  Then
we
throw in pacify, and a couple of stuns.  Or, in this case, it was one stun
and
gate (forgot to unmem it from earlier).  I do use all of these spells fairly
frequently, and wouldn't be real eager to give any of them up.

------------------------------------------
Not sure what prices on FV are like, but try getting a "Donal's Bracer of
Mourning" - mana free cleric clicky pacify bracer.  Great item to have and
free's up a spell slot.
