hypocrite \Hyp"o*crite\, n. [F., fr. L. hypocrita, Gr. ? one who plays
a part on the stage, a dissembler, feigner. See Hypocrisy.] One who
plays a part; especially, one who, for the purpose of winning
approbation of favor, puts on a fair outside seeming; one who feigns
to be other and better than he is; a false pretender to virtue or
piety; one who simulates virtue or piety.

You attack those that disagree with you using childish insults and
vulgarity. You then procede to admonish these same people to develop
skills that you are sorely lacking (as evidenced by your previous
posts). You feign to be other and better than you truly are, and
therefore validate my statement.

You play the part of having "social skills", but in fact you do not.
You play the part of having reasoned and intelligent thought, but in
fact do not. You are obviously ill prepared to debate any subject with
sound reasoning.
