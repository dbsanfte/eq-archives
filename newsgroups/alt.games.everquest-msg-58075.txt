While I can't describe the actual mechanics of how the hate list works
in the underlying code, I can tell you that this is patently incorrect.
I've found over and over that it's cumulative. As recently as a week ago
we were in Lower Guk and our rogue, Orlun was drawing aggro like crazy
for some reason. At one point he stood there, not attacking or anything,
just waiting for his evade to recycle. I hit taunt twice and the mob
stayed on him. At first we thought it was because I had better faction
with the undead frogs than he did, but even after I got to KOS it was
true. I've also had to taunt multiple times to get a mob off a cleric
after they cast a complete heal while they just stood there. One press
of the taunt button does definitely *NOT* automatically put you one
point ahead of everyone else on the hate list. It just adds more to your
cumulative hate. But a wizard that starts in with their big nukes as the
pull comes in will still get so much hate that five taunts won't get the
mob off them.
