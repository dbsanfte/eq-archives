What's your point? That because it crashed, I'm wrong about it being a
newsreader? Or because it crashed, I shouldn't be using it. All programs
will crash eventually, it's about reliabilty. This is the first problem like
this I have had with OE. I have just removed three newsreader programs that
were supposed to be better from my computer; one would crash whenever I
attempted to start it, one would time out when downloading messages, and the
third was not inuitive enough to easily setup.
