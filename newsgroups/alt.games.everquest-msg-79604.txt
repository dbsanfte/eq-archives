Halflings? Yeah.  I read somewhere that EQ beta had them called "Hobbits,"
but Tolkien's heirs got upset.  No idea if that's true...never seen anything
official.

Orcs, goblins, elves (including wood & dark), trolls, ogres,  just to name a
few are in just about any fairy tale you look at.  Most fairy tales predate
Tolkien by centuries.  Tolkien's epic story is just a good-against-evil
story with a fairy tale backbone.  Neither is very original.  That doesn't
detract on the enjoyment garnered from reading "The Lord of the Rings" at
all, but that doesn't change anything.  Why didn't Tolkien call his monsters
something else?  I'll give you Halflings since I can't find an earlier
reference to them.  Besides that I can't think of anything else they
definitely took from LotR...there's just not much connection between the two
besides generic names.  Hell YEAH they were INFLUENCED by Tolkien...what
computer geek isn't? :)

In answer to your question, I know of no novel.  Legends, myths and
histories, some of which turn into fairy tales but I doubt if we'll ever
know how much are the only things I know of that you can read.  Nowadays I
don't think parents read to their children (if they do at all) anything like
what Tolkien's parents probably read to him.
