   Not quite.  Firiona Vie fits this description, though it does have a specialized
rule set that might be seen as either a good or bad thing, depending on your point of
view.  IMHO, since the May patch, this server is much easier to play than it was
before.  But don't think about coming over if role playing or the TLC pisses you
off.  Also, you cannot transfer on and off of FV, as far as I know.  

Annie <--- Not going to mention that the Biz has also overlooked the new European
servers.  They are new, 
           but I doubt if they are low population.

My main on Firiona Vie:

By the side of Lenny, the Traveling Ogre Warrior.
Members of the Council of Mithril Dreams.
Teapray  -- High Elf Cleric, 23, poaching Gorillas in Warsliks Woods.

Several others played on Drinal, highest is a level 30 Ranger.
