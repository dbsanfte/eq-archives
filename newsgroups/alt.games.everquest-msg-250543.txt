Yes.  Use it as soon as the mob begins to turn from you if you are
main tank.  If you are not main tank, don't use it.

Go for dual wielding high damage low delay weapons. Faster weapons are
usually better as you damage bonus will be applied more often, not
that you have a damage bonus at level 10.

No effect. If fighting a caster save kick/slam/bash (all the same
timer) for when the mob begins to cast. Kick won't stun until you're
in the mid-50's, so slam or bash caster mobs. If it's a melee mob,
kick as often as possible.

Depends. My warrior grew up pulling but mostly in outdoor zones where
I could get singles or just two.  Taunt puts you at the top of the
mob's hate list, so a good skill in it can get you high aggro fast
from whomever. Taunt can fail though.  Better to have singles or a way
to control the mobs DPS than to lock down aggro from more mobs doing
more DPS than the healer can repair.

>Range weapons - are range weapons more likely to deviate the mob from the

Depends on the weapons.  Typically, proximity has a taunt effect, so a
ranged attack should not pull the mob to you as fast as the same
damage from a sword. If your range weapon way outclasses the MT's
melee weapons, you can get aggro.  As I said, proximity has an aggro
affect, so if you are MT get as close as you can to fight; if you are
not the MT, fight from the max distance you can.

Did you mean deviate the mob from the puller? That depends on how the
puller got aggro. If a wizrd pulls with Ice Comet, you are going to
have a tough time getting aggro with a bow.
