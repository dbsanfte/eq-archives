From the article: " Racing game enthusiasts, for example, will be able to
buy a faster car to give them an edge in the game for a slight bit more,
should they wish. "

I think this is the important difference. You will be able to get a car that
is better than your opponents if you pay the guy who owns the racetrack more
than the other guy. In real life, this is called bribery. If this is a
multiplayer game, and you can get better and better equipment by paying
more, then why not bias the game towards the people who will pay hundreds of
dollars more for a chance to humiliate an opponent. I'm not up with player
vs player games like counterstrike but i know how worked up people get about
being beaten. How would you feel about being beaten not by someone with
superior skills but simply a larger inheritance?

Heaven forbid Bill gates plays Gary kasparov in an online game of chess! The
board would be solid with extra queens...
