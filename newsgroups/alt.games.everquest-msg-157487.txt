Cash?  Who said anything about cash?  I've NEVER turned a profit off of
porting that I couldn't have made faster by hunting.  Never.  The ONE time I
spent a few days trying to earn some quick cash by porting, I earned only a
miniscule FRACTION of what I could have earned hunting at the time.  All the
rest of the time I ported for free around 80% of the time.  The times I DID
get paid, it averaged 1-10 pp.  Hardly enough to call a cash cow.

Just because others have used their abilities to cash in, don't assume
that's what motivates us all, and don't think that just because something
can be used to exploit pp out of people that it has no other value to that
class.

Yes, I hate d00ds that pester me for ports, but I LOVED that I had ONE thing
that I could do for my friends and for those I wanted to help.  I could get
them around, quickly, easily, and no matter what their level, they needed
me.

Eh?  Druids are travelers.  That's what it has always said in the
literature.  That's the ONLY thing we could do that others couldn't do
better.

Look, I don't want to get into class-envy here.  It remains that one of our
only important utilities has been rendered superfulous.  Nothing has been
given to us to take it's place.  I'm GLAD that others have it easier now.
I'm NOT so glad that the only service I had to offer my friends is now
useless, and I've been given nothing to take it's place.

Again with the cash, and now I'm whining too...  What makes you think I care
about cash?  I'm 44th level, and I have less than 1k pp in the bank.  Is it
your opinion that all Druids and Wizards ONLY care about the PP they can
get?  Has nobody EVER given you a free port or TL, or been willing to?  If
this is true, you're hanging around with the wrong people.  I have NEVER
charged anyone I was remotely friendly with, or knew at all for a port.  I
did it because I liked helping my guild members and friends, no other
reason.

If your friends charge you for ports, you need new friends.  If they don't
then what makes you think all Druids are worried about cash, or that we're
concerned about it at all?

Ah, now we're into pathetic.

Well, again, I dont' want to start a class warfare flame.  Nor do I want to
get into a flame war with anyone that would call someone pathetic in his
first response to him with no provocation.  If you feel clever or important
calling me pathetic then you are welcome to do so.  Would you like me to
anounce to the whole newsgroup that you have beaten me sensless via usenet
flames, and that you are vastly superior to me?

If that would make you feel good, I will...
