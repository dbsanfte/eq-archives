What would be a reasonable balance between cost and effectiveness for 
weapons given to Necro pets? I know that the factor taken into account is 
the damage, rather than the delay, so I imagine that the more damage, the 
better, but where could I find out the base damage for each pet spell, so 
as not to actually *reduce* the damage output with the wrong weapon?

For example, i find that a Rusty Battle Axe improves the performance of the 
lvl 12 pet, but I imagine that this is perhaps not the case for the lvl 16 
pet, while rusty halberds or some higher-damage weapons may still be 
useful... Actually, it would be nice to find somewhere a table of the most 
effective weapons for each level.

Also, is everything that's true for Necro pets also true for Mage pets, or 
are there different factors to take into account?
