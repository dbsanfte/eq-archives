I've heard good and bad things about having dialup.  Some people have no
problems at all, some can't go on Luclin.  I have DSL so can't really help
you there
You have plenty of RAM, don't know about the rest because I don't know all
that much.
I'm running 512MB of RAM right now and I go to Dawnshroud all the time.
Some tweaks you should look at are:  1)Clipplane - turn this as far down as
you can stand to have it.  I usually click this down till the marker is at
the p in Clip. This makes the most difference in framerates. 2) Sky - turn
off 3d sky, don't need a fancy sky all the time and it helps  3) Look at all
the other options under display and play around with what you need and don't
need and you'll find a satisfactory setting for you.

Have Fun
