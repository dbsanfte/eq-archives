I notice the response to most greif tactics eventually came down to
"log out and play an alt if it's too bad". Therein lies the problem:
People being able to bully you off the character you wanted to play
and having no viable means of striking back ruin the enjoyment of the
game. At least on other servers you can petition the trainers and
greif players. Frankly, I won't go near a server that allows and even
encourages dirty, bullyish tactics. Although, SZ does have one perk -
some of the worst greif players were funneled over to their very own
playground. Didn't make a huge difference for the rest of us, but
every little bit helps.
