I agree. You get no response from the red necro, just assume they are 
AFK and loot away.

I think a newbie could easily get rich in BBM on Xev right now, helping 
themselves to my corpses. Up to glares overnight. And they cannot get 
through my AC/defense. The only way I can possibly die is if someone 
decided to train me with guards. Which could happen, and I have accepted 
that risk. I'm not foolish enough to have bound nearby.
