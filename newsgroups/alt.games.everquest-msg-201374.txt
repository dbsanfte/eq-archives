Oh bard is a lot of clicking if you don't set up hotkeys...a lot of sanity
down the drain too.  But pretty danged easy WITH hotkeys for routine stuff
with that /pause command.  My bard is only around level 30 and languishing
there for the last 3 years so I couldn't really give you good examples, but
my friend routinely sings 4 songs at once and can sometimes stick a 5th one
in.  All with less noise then my warrior friend doing 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2
3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 plus strafing, plus whatever else he
does (he's a great MT).
