Wow! You may be meaner than a snake with a toothache, but I'll admit
that made me laugh.

Mostly true, but I can tell you that it only seems to be applicable up
to around level fifty. Not that every class isn't slow to level after
that, but it probably *seems* worse for the druids because it does bog
down. Their lower relative dps (compared to a wizard's AoE nukes, for
example) makes for loooong kills, be it quadding or root/rotting. Seen
quite a few druids who primarily solo give up in the early fifites. We
have some mid-fifties in our guild who've been post fifty for over a
year now, and in that time have leveled up one or two other characters
past their former main.  They still play the druids, but say it's just
slow and boring as hell. Even grouped they seem to move slow.
