Ever since the patch a couple weeks or so ago, I have had EQ crashing 
problems as well.  Often when I camp to character select screen, and 
often after my bazaar mule has been up for a long time, if I go to do 
something, like click on a target, or bring up the /trader window again, 
it will crash out on me.  I never had this problem prior to the patch, so 
I am tending to blame SoE for the issue, particularly since I am not the 
only one experiencing the problem, and no hardware/software similarities 
have been noted with the people who have the problem.
