I get the same treatment all of the time... my character is an
un-anonymous/roleplay Human Shadow Knight. I have black plate armour and a
two handed sword so I'm -obviously- a SK. Yet, I get asked for ports, SOW,
rezzes, buffs, and once I even got a request to play mana song for someone.
The sad thing is, these people were all past level 40...

Okay, I know that Shadow Knights are the best porters, SOWers, rezzers,
buffers, and the best with mana regeneration, but god damn... give us some
privacy.

Sometimes I just want to reach through my monitor and slap stupid people
around with their own spleen.
