To quote from your original post...
"Anyone a member of http://www.bugbytes.tk ? I have heard that its a pretty
good site, but was looking for a couple of opinions."

You have heard?  Makes it sound like you know nothing about it.  In reality,
this was nothing but SPAM.  I wouldn't even bother with going to the
website, now, as I have zero trust in you and know that your information is
less than useless.

You remind me of something I had to scrape off the bottom of my shoe this
morning.
