Hi! I have Kunark/SoL and of course, regular EQ installed. I just bought a
copy of Velious via ebay (unopened, of course) will I have any
issues/problems when I install it? Anything special I need to do to keep my
settings? When I bought EQ I got the EQ/Kunark package, velious had just
come out and I wasn't sure how into the game I'd get.... SoL I got right
away,
