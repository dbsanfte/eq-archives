Yes I know, I am ashamed too, but, what can I say.  I only upgraded from
win95 a few months ago, it did everything I needed just fine, it was more
stable than friends' installs of 98 and me.  I didn't have to reboot it more
than once every few days.  I now use Win2k, and am very impressed by the
stability.  I can leave it running for weeks, no reboots, no crashes.  I am
starting to wonder if MS secretly stole it from someone else and slapped
their name on it.
