Just rented "A Knight's Tale" and while skimming through the previews
I came across a trailer/preview for out favorite game! I was a bit 
surprised to say the least. It was very well done indeed. 
 
 I'd just logged off to take a break after playing for a while to
watch a movie and after seeing the preview I wanted to log on and
play again it was so good. Very well put together.
 
 If you guys get the chance it's a must see. Maybe I'll report on the 
movie later if it's any good.   8^)
