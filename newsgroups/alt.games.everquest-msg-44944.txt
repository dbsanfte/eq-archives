Interesting... A ranger friend of mine keeps complaining about
fizzling See Invis a lot. I've seen him fizzle it 40 times in
a row. He said his skill was (IIRC) 120 or so, and he's level
47. He also said this was the ONLY spell of that school (div?
I can't remember...) that fizzles that often. Any other rangers
experience the same thing?

Anyway, I told him to /bug it, cause it can't be meant to be
that hard a spell to cast, can it? I mean, it's a low level
spell, isn't it?
