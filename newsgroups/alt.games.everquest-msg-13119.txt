Well, the way you phrased your question implied that you would like to
go to Ill Omen but the spiders were stopping you.

Try East Karana.  It's near where you are now, not too far from banks
(HH, Rivervale, maybe even Runnyeye (I don't know what the factions are
for the Runnyeye banker)).  South Karana would be good for a while, too.

The newly revamped Runnyeye has mobs in your range, I believe.

Another possibility, maybe, is undead in Kith at night.  I know they go
up to way higher than your level, but I don't know how low they go.
Normally, I wouldn't even suggest considering it until the mid to late
30's, because of the higher level undead, but if you get a Ranger in
your group to make sure you avoid the higher level undead, it could be
good, *if* the lower level undead are low enough level.  Kith has easy
banking in HH and Rivervale.

Najeena might be good.  I think it currently has some undead of around
level 20ish near the top.
