/sigh
Again, you've completely ignored the point.  I argue that KEI is
unnecessary, you reply "It's plain insane NOT to have KEI".  Given
the context, how is this different from "[You are] insane NOT to
have KEI"?  Answer:  it's not different in any meaningful way.  And
while your absurd retort to my reply-in-kind was mildly amusing,
your next follow-up was quite the hoot.  Still, I see you've got a
fan club now, apparently you're not the only person in the group
who believes in that sort of weaselly barracks-lawyering bullshit.
Maybe the three of you can get together and form a mutual admiration
society to chortle knowingly about one another's astonishing wit.
