You have no clue, do you, what censorship is, do you?

In the US we have freedom of expression.  However, that does not mean you 
can say whatever you want to in my house.  If I invite you over as a dinner 
guest, and you start swearing up a storm, and I ask you to stop, and you 
don't, and then I ask you to leave, and you won't, then I have the perfect 
right to call the police and have you forcibly evicted.

You're in Blizzard's house.  It's not "your" game, it's Blizzard's game. 
They have a right to do pretty much what they want to with their game.  You 
have no rights at all.  Not one, zilch, zero, zippo.  It's Blizzard's world, 
and you have to live by their rules or not play, and quite clearly you have 
chosen the latter.

The fact that they discourage the use of certain words in conversation has 
nothing whatsoever to do with censorship.

What injustice?  If one of your units dies in LoTR: Battle for Middle Earth 
and it gets removed from the playing field, do you get to cry "injustice!" 
and rail at the game makers for their unjust rules of the game?  Or could it 
simply be that there are rules being enforced that have nothing whatsoever 
to do with what you personally believe to be just?

It's their game they're allowing you to play.  Your "rights" end the moment 
you start playing.
