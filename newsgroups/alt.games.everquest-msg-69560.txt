No. Pre-Luclin they came down once a week if that for a small patch. Since
Luclin they have been patching much more as to be expected with a rollout of
a new expansion. I for one am very please with it, after seeing how long
Funcom took to try to fix Anarchy Online (and it wasnt fixed after 2 1/2
months of playin) I think Verant is doin a great job.
Expect the down time to get less and less as the days pass.
