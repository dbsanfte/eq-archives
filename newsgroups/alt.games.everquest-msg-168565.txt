}You seem to equate HTML with Microsoft.  HTML is an international standard
}that was started long before Microsoft got its grubby little fingers on it.

Most of the newsreaders that insist on spewing HTML by default into our 
lovely newsgroup are made by microsoft.  That is the association.

}Most every modern newsreader can handle HTML,

False.  And besides, most modern newsreaders cannot be used over a telnet 
connection, which rules them out for many USENET users.

}and the amount of overhead that
}it introduces in most messages is quite modest (as long as it's not crap
}HTML produced by Microsoft Word!)

That is a matter of opinion.  My newsreader cannot handle HTML.  Period.  
And I refuse to switch to some newsreader that -you- prefer.  I quite like 
this one, thank you.  

}Adapt to new things, or spend the rest of your life fighting meaningless 
}battles.  Do you want your tombstone to read "I kept HTML out of 
}Usenet!"?  Such a noble cause.

I find that the best way for me to keep HTML out of usenet is by not 
posting it.  And I do think that keeping usenet readable by all newsreaders 
in the forums I care about is a noble cause.  If you want to spew illegible 
garbage, don't be suprised if many people ignore it or complain about it.

It's about as polite as calling up someone's voice phone and sending them a 
fax, then bitching at them because they don't have a fax machine there.

}Personally, I prefer standard ASCII too, because it makes the messages 
}easier to read when they are all the same typeface.  But I wouldn't insist 
}on it.

Then -you- are hereby appointed to answer all posts that appear here in 
HTML.  The rest of us will continue to complain about them.
