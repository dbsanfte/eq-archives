OK - I would still like to note that it isnt that simple. I have done a
fair amount of research time with Alzheimer's and though ethics of this
nature is not an area I was personally invovled with I do know people who
were and there are significant issues to deal with beyond simply saying
the decision is bad. If I may use Alzheimers as an issue - some cases are
directly attributable to a single point mutation that is domninant
(actually there is more than one gene that can do this). That dominance
means that in those families there is a 50/50 chance for any kid to
develop the disease. The age at which this means the diseases appears will
vary from family to family but is more predictable and earlier than
typical 'late onset Alzheimer's' which is defined as age 65 or later.

Someone with this is in the situation of a serious genetic disorder
(dementia is not a laughing matter), with a 50.50 chance of passing it on.
There are however very significant issues that mean that it is not as
simple as saying having a child is a bad idea. Even if the typical onset
is say 55 for the family (not unreasonable). This person can have a long
fulfilling life, contrifubte much to society. Add to that the actual
incidence of Alzheimer's in the population (we do start to talk of figures
of 25% dementia affected in late 60s and early 70s of age for the NON -
genetic cases without conisdering any other risk fators). Its can be
fairly slow progressing and as such the choice is not. I would submit
anyway, as simple as you might suggest.

Sure there is going to be variance around that with other diseases much
more quick to occur, and much more likely, and some that will fall into
the bracket you covered will be less potent on those factors.

I was assuming that to be metaphorical for 'being bad' or similar on that
note.

I didnt think you were...I did think you had made an error.
