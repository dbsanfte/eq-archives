Not real clear on why you have decided to never go for the epic,
but look for a Velium Etched Stone Mace (I think) which drops off 
Yaka Razorhoof in GD.

You won't be able to get it until much later in life unless you 
can buy it, but it is a pretty nice 1 HB weapon for a non-uber 
druid.

Now, back to issue one:  The epic.

The druid epic is probably the easiest epic in the game.  You 
*will* want it before too long, as you level up further and 
further.

Much of it can be soloed, and with out being "uber."

Unless you are planning on quitting EQ while you are in your 20s
you will need to bail on the idea of doing a whole lot of melee,
because the druid is *not* a melee type PC.  The druid will not
*ever* be a melee char, without an awful lot of changes from 
Verant.

Please learn Snare, DOT, Root, DOT, DOT DOT.  For wide open 
spaces where you won't pull over others, learn Snare, DOT, group 
MOBs up close, AE Nuke, run away, AE Nuke, run away, etc.

With these techniques, you can solo into your 50s, and then 
when the high end game starts looking attractive to you, you 
will have to learn how to be a druid all over again, for group 
situations, because the solo druid and the grouped druid are 
two very very different creatures, but both are fun if you like 
that sort of thing.
