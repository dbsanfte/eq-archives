Er, yeah.  One of our clerics only has the bracer from KC, but the Extended
Range focus on that is good enough for the level 39 spell Complete Healing.

JOOC, what option is there for people who don't have range focii?  Is there
a bard song that increases spell distance?

Heh, well, like I said we're still trying to figure out healing strategy.
One thing that was recommended was to have someone chain-casting Spell
Shield on the MT to help deal with the damage spikes.

Well, I actually have half-a-second or even a second after the gem refreshes
before I have to cast again.

Yeah, we're trying to prepare ourselves for that.  Using EE's seems very
expensive - but then, I guess the cost is half-an-hour of XP-ing in Fire.
=)  It's all relative.

Gonna try to make this argument on the guild boards.

Oh, I was kinda wondering... he seemed a lot easier to kill the last couple
of times we've killed him compared to the first time.

I chose not to hear that.  <sticks fingers in ears>  lalalalalalalalala

> The one that really bugs me is no Healing Adept.

Heh, yeah.  I think I'm the only cleric ever who became Exarch without ever
spending any points in Healing Gift or Healing Adept.  Contrast this to the
cleric who just became a full member; when she first became a recruit she
was only 64, but she still had all her healing AA maxed out.

I'm not *against* HG or HA by any means... I'm starting to put points into
them now.  But I seldom heal for the maximum allowable anyway - I can count
on my fingers the number of times a CH has landed for 7500.  I just didn't
see that maxing HA would make a significant difference.

Having said that, it's hard to justify the points I spent on Bestow Divine
Aura or Innate Invisibility to Undead.  =)  I just wanted to become an
Exarch.  Now that the ego trip is out of the way, though, I've started doing
more useful things with my AA.  Not wasting AA is the major reason I'm not
doing the multi-GM tradeskill quest for that awesome earring; I just can't
justify dumping all that AA in New Tanaan Crafting Mastery.

Really?  MC1 seems a no brainer, and even MC2 is worth it eventually.
However, spending 6AA for 1 point of mana regen seems like a complete waste
to me.  Sure, when I have more AA than I know what to do with I'll get MC3.

Thanks for the rest of the list.  I'll probably but healing and related AA
before the defensive AA, but it's still a good guide for what I should be
aiming for.

<sigh>  Yeah, yeah.  I'm doing PoM for the fun of it more than anything, but
given the rarity of the necessary drops your point is well-taken: spend time
getting AA.  I don't think I'll give up on PoM but I'll probably spend less
time there and more time grinding AA.  You're right, I have a loooong way to
go on my AA.

Thanks for the feedback, James.  =)
