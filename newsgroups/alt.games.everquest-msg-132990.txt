Met plenty of metaphysical conservatives of that bent, too.

C: Things taught have to come in the right order.  You can't teach C 
unless they know A and B already.  If they come and ask you a question, to 
which the answer is A, but if you were going to be really complete and 
thorough, you would tell them 'A, B, and C', it may be advisable to just 
tell them A and see if they immediately ask about B.  If they don't, they 
may need to chew on A for a while.  But they'll be back.

There's nothing beyond their comprehension if you build up to it in little 
bite-size chunks.

Well, TV show, actually.  ...SPANISH INQUISITION!...

Monty Python's Flying Circus.

I submit that it ain't.

I'll save you the trouble.  It's the surgical procedure of cutting a hole 
in the skull, used in ancient times to 'let evil spirits out', or more 
likely, to release pressure on the brain.

Well, you're stuck then.  I consider it proven beyond a reasonable doubt 
by inspection.  The rest shall be left as an exercize for the reader.
