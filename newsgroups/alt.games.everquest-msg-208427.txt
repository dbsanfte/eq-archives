Just picked up Eq again after a 6 month hiatus... never really got that into
it previously. Got a couple chars up to 31st, and bunch of others into their
mid-late teens...never guilded previously... just soloed, or joined the odd
pick-up group.

Playtimes around 3+ hours / avail most nights starting 'round 11pm PST.

Basically, I'm looking for a group of people to run the low/mid levels with,
and if I make it to the high end game great... I'd like to run in raids...
and i'd like to know people when I get there. What I'm not looking for is
handouts or powerlevelling...or to join a guild where the focus is on
leveling as fast as you can... I'd far rather spend a few hours finding out
how far i can get into some abandoned old-world dungeon then spend 25 levels
in the Paludual Carverns just because its more 'efficient'. To me seeing the
world at a level when its a challenge is the point. The high end game isn't
going anywhere, so why rush through the first half to get there...

 i've always been a sort of earn-it-yourself "ironman" sort of play style
... but as everyone knows eq doesn't make life easy for untwinked soloers in
midgame...and I got tired of having to skip dungeons/quests/content because
they pretty much required a group...and it was near impossible to find a
pick up group willing to take out a quest mob... no loot/shite xp for the
effort... and there is little to nothing at all to do at the end-game by
yourself...

[don't get me wrong I've got nothing against twinks, I even twink my own
chars... i just don't like handouts from others... its to the point where
the handouts are so far ahead of anything you could ever get yourself that
it takes the point out of playing... no quest you can do, no mob you can
kill, nothing you can do can improve your character... I just get bored
without the thrill of finding the next item... knowing that I'm wearing
common 'worthless' drops from 55+ mobs makes life at 25th level pretty
emtpy... :) so I don't do it...]

So this time round I want to hook up with a guild, make some friends, and
see where that goes... but I'm having a tough time finding people...
wandered around the newb zones last night for a couple hours ... hardly ran
into a soul...and those few were soloing mega-twinks or high levels
factioning... :(

Surfing the web for guilds was fruitless...mostly 404 errors or raiders
looking for 65th Clerics with 100AAs, and 8+ hours 7 days a week...I
wouldn't even want to qualify. ;)

The characters I've got are mostly on Morell Thule, though I don't mind a
re-roll at all on another server if the guild is a good fit.

Anyways, suggestions welcome...specific guilds/ servers/ up-to-date websites
listing guilds/ or even just advice...

thanks.
