    The day previous, I had run the quest to bring my enchanter from 35 to
36. So if there is a minimum level, it can be no greater than 35. If he
wants a nice, quiet, slow place to go from 34 to 35 solo which can also drop
some fair items, the Ancient Crocodile spawn in Upper Guk works (don't know
that one could handle this pre-34, I've never tried).
