It happens a lot as there are a lot of nice people in Norrath. I am one of
them. I always help people retrieve corpses, give Clarity etc with my
Enchanter. Whenever I travel back to Gfay to sell what I have gained I
always take a quick trip up North to Orc hill and Crushbone and buff all the
newer chars there. Obvious twinks I stay away from. A lot of the common
swords from Velious are excellent for the lower lvl fighters and helps them
in the cuase. Being nice to younger chars helps them grow into better later
chars. You will find a lot of idiots later on but just ignore them, they
have no friends in the game or out. Make friends early on in the game and
they remain friends throughout. Always take time to roleplay a little with
emotes etc. But one thing you should never do is beg. I have an emote on
shout so that whenever someone begs it shouts across the zone 'Soandso fails
at begging, my char increases skill "Ignore beggars" to 176' :o)

Have fun
