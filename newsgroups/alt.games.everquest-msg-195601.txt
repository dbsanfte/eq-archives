A three group raid of casual players in Halls of Testing might take around
2:30 to 2:45 to kill something like, say, a fiery guardian in the Halls of
Testing.

My point is that Wizards (casual ones, anyway) aren't a high *sustained* DPS
class.  On raids, if we pace ourselves to contribute on every fight, the per
fight contribution is low.  If we try to match the other damage dealers on
any given fight, we are then conspicuously sitting on our asses medding a
lot.  

KEI is just enough of an increase that we can feel like we are not bringing
the least to the table for most of the raid.  (We probably still are, but it
is not as obvious with KEI :-)).
