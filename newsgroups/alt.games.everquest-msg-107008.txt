Well, last night was another EQ first.

After spending a couple nights playing with specs in Oasis (wheee!
Fun!) it was time to look for new challenges.  And what did I see last
night?  A bunch of guildies in Velks.  "Oh boy," I thought to myself,
"that could be interesting!"  
"Oh wait - they have the older guild cleric with 'em," (53, I
believe), "can't be too bad..."  
So I whined and wheedled and made a nuisance of myself until the hint
was picked up and I was invited to come join 'em.  :-)

Now, this was nervous work for me.  I've read a lot about velks here
and other places, and had the distinct impression of 'uberness'.
Uber, I am not.  Far from it.  But I do like to try new things, so off
I went.  Shaking and quaking, but went all the same.

So, I get there, get invited, and the other cleric informs me that
he's leaving soon!  
/em gulps and looks nervous.  
I about left at that point, but the puller(s) (yep, 2 of 'em) showed
up about then and since I had mana.... I stayed.  Was still a little
nervous, wondering why the cleric was having mana problems....

And then I con'd the beasties.  Most of 'em were white to me (45 at
the time), later saw a few yellows, one red and a handful of blues. 
"Hmmm..." I thinks to myself.  "This seems like a good place for me to
be!"  And yes, we were hunting barely into the zone.  Spiders and
statues, iirc.  I'm sure it gets tougher, probably MUCH tougher,
further in.

Ok, so there's the story - now the question:  
Why doesn't anybody go there to hunt before lvl 50?  

The mobs are at a great exp level for mid to upper 40s.  Heck, I
picked up an orange (and dinged 46) in about an hour of playing - I
was pretty pleased and plan to go back.  But I felt so damn *young* in
there!  
Follow-on question:  Saw a lot of folks running around with titles and
epics there.  I'm not complaining (at all!) but surely there's better
exp on higher mobs somewhere?  Or is Velks the pick-up zone for the
50+ crowd?  Again, not complaining (and loved the drive by buffs!) but
sure am curious.

Or is it just my server (Rodcet Nife)?

Curiously,
