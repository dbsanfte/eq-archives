Nah, not necessarily.  There's a couple people who post on Zeb's "official"
ezboard named SamadBots and Mareth whose sole flame consists of mentioning
sucking on dick (which I find rather...odd, in a 'queer' sort of way) and
the more vocal regulars laugh WITH them, not AT them.  There's another one,
Fitz (probably a Fitz on every server, doubt if it's the same guy), who uses
the same old tired flames all the time (not homosexually, just assholishly)
that they also think is hilarious.  These three boys can't type anything
wrong.

So the same insults over & over...may not make a difference.
