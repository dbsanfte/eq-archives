No offense to you personally, but I've seen a few people here mention that 
this is an ambiguous question. I thought it was pretty clear.

How much xp (loot doesn't really change much from red to light blue in EQL 
as I understand it - I believe that's quite different in EQ2) would one 
expect to get from an orange mob in EQ2 in terms of percentage of a level 
gained? Is that comparable to the rate one would experience killing a light 
blue mob in EQL?
