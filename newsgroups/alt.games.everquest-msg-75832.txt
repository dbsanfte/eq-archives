I love this server!! No Tweaks!  Love the fact that its Roleplaying, which I
had thought the game was meant to be, but it seems not to be the case for
most, maybe because the idea of roleplaying escapes them...
I love the language restrictions too, I even wish NPC's would play by that
rule.
As for me, I'm building a new name for Levarian, though I regret leaving all
that hard faction work behind (especially after 2+ years of building it
everywhere, but I will still keep the old Lev alive on the Nameless)
So, anyone looking for a sword for hire, with extensive knowledge, hail
Levarian Halfblood.

Half Elf Warrior, -weapons expert.
