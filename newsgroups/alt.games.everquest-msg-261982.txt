Hey, my iksar monk was ally with em. warriors till they nerfed max factions.
He could wander about, trade and so forth, and it was just the banker who
ached to keel heem..... keel heem gooood... but bankers are like that.

Actually if i was doing it now, i think i could just smash the arboreals to
get on his good side but my iksar monk semi retired after the great monk
nerf and will re-emerge after the developers have finished 'reviewing' the
impact or i can twink him to ridiculous levels, whichever comes first.
