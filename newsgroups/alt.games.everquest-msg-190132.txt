I see your smiley, but I'm not so sure you understand the risks.  Would you
have suggested to Reagan "forget negotiating treaties with Russia, just nuke
them"?  It's one of those undeniable facts of life that nuclear nations
require different treatment than non-nuclear ones.  The stakes aren't just
higher, they're orders of orders of magnitude higher.  The fact is, neither
Iraq nor North Korea could defend itself to the point where the U.S. could
not defeat it if we wanted to.  Hell, the only reason that Iraq seems to be
doing so well is that we've set so high of a standard for ourselves that
every single casualty is big news.  Can you imagine if Normandy was fought
with the kill ratios we have in this war?

In the end, though, it's not the U.S. that will pay for an attack on North
Korea.  It's Japan and South Korea.  There is no way we can stop that.

So, do we do the "brave" thing, and attack with relative impunity (compared
to other nations)?  Or, do we bite the bullet and accept that this battle
has already been lost.  Remember, the war in Iraq isn't to deprive Saddam of
all the nuclear weapons he has, but to keep him from obtaining them.  Saddam
isn't a would-be Hitler, he's a would-be Kim Jong.
