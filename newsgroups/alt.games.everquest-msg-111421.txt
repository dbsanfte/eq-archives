Until this foolishness in Lancaster, I would have read this statement,
tossed my hands up and admonished you to "Say no more!".

No, I believe you. I missed the part where you were including other
newsgroups, that's all. I initially thought you were referring to
posts in this thread, rather than the world at large.

Yes, there have been calls to ban religion throughout history. To
those who call for it, I say "Good luck, and get stuffed". Even in the
years when I held an atheist point of view I wouldn't have suggested
any such foolish thing.


And, for those keeping track...

I was raised Catholic. In college I became a Born Again for awhile. I
then turned to atheism for many years, and for the past three years
I've been a student of Wicca. The atheism period was a result of not
being able to articulate (even to myself) my beliefs, and of course I
enjoyed torquing god-squad types. When I first stumbled onto Wicca it
was as though a bell had rung, and I thought "What, I'm not the only
one who feels this way?"

I'm rambling. I must be avoiding work.
