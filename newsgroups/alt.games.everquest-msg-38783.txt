Currently trying to max out my swimming skill while taking care of some
RL stuff near my computer. (Basically just swimming in endless circles
in the river next to the FP office of the people with a weight on the
left turn key and autorun on.)  I got to wondering. What factors are
affected by higher swimming skill?
Speed?
Length of time you can hold your breath?
Is your underwater combat ability bolstered?
(Thinking of going to Kedge soon, and in case of some disastrous EB
failure somehow, I'd like to max my survival odds.)
Any other benefit to doing this, aside from the satisfaction of maxing
out *all* your skills?
['You've become better at swimming! (138)']
Working on my last two weapons type combat skills. (*gasp*) 1HB at 102.
Hand to Hand not started and may never. Probably will forget about
archery and throwing as I only use them for pulling anyway. They can go
up on their own or not.
