That's a crapshoot.  Lag can make that fail.  I used to have a macro
that would turn auto attack off, pause, then feign.  Junked that and do
it all by hand now.  Auto off, wait a few seconds (maybe longer if in a
bad chunk of lag), then FD.  Backing away from the mob or just plain
turn and running a ways (even if it means possibly getting stunned) also
seem to make pesky mobs forget you.  Also don't drop below 1 bub o'
health before feigning.  When you hit 1 bub of life, it pumps your taunt
up reel gud.  I've also found that very high level mobs (5+ levels on
you), have a higher tendancy to see through a FD (also very hard to
shake aggro).
