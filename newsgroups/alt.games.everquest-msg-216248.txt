I know track assures snare, but the dungeons are laid out in a pretty simple
way so I'd snare is the key ability and track just a bonus that comes with
it if it's a ranger/druid.

I'd also put crowd control below slow and snare for being most important. 
If you just blunder into each room you're never going to fight more than
five mobs at once, and there's generally only a couple of rooms that even
approach that.
