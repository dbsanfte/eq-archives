I'm *in* the oil industry, and I just haven't seen any
reasonable scenario by which it would make sense for us to
expect an "oil advantage" through attacking Iraq.

I really doubt that anyone in the administration is naive enough
to think that we're likely to end up with a "friendly regime" in
Iraq, long-term.  It may happen, but it's unlikely.  Odds
are better it'll end up in the hands of government which is,
at best, as fixated on its own interests as any other government
which feels that it doesn't owe any special favors to the US.
At worst it'll spend a lengthy period in civil war, or have
a theocracy like Iran has had for the past two decades (although
Iran's looks about to crumble).

We're not doing this for the "oil".  If the oil was our
main concern, we'd just buddy up to Saddam and look the
other way when he gasses people.

US foreign policy makes more sense than the way it's
often portrayed.  And often doing the right thing is more
important than doing what will make us popular.

We're putting pressure on them too, it's just that when they're
"nominal allies" we have more options open to us, not all of
which make the newspapers.

But needless to say, Saddam isn't going to straighten up
unless more extreme measures are applied.

What would you suggest, we start bombing Saudi Arabia?
Doesn't it make more sense to try other methods first, ones
which leverage the fact that they *are* (to some extent)
our allies?

First, I disagree that there will be major waves of people
inspired by Saddam's martyrdom.

Second, I think it *is* a good thing to flush out the borderline
terrorists while we have a full-bore presence in that region
and have all our high-tech bloodhounds at work.

One of the smarter things we did in Afghanistan was to let all
the region's Taliban sympathizers pour into Afghanistan and sign
up for duty for a while, *then* we started carpet-bombing.

I disagree, for a number of reasons.
