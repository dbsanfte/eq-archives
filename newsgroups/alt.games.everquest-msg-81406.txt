Maybe yes, maybe no. There is some speculation that the Wolf Slayer
quest (in DS Peaks) may be the beginning of the BL Epic. It, in turn,
starts with the Hunter's Pike quest.

Other than that, I've seen no useful speculation about it. I think too
many guilds that have the first few handfuls of 50+ BLs are telling
their members to stay hushed up. They know that means it will take
them longer to find it, but they figure they may have no competition
for it when they get there.

Please, if you know anything, post and be heard! It can only help
speed the solution to this most anticipated BL quest!
