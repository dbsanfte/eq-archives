Yep - It kind of pleasantly surprised me too. Thanks to all those who gave
advice - especially Arolpins detailed tactical suggestions which will be of
great help in the future.

He got taken out for his first spin last night and I am happy to report he
is still level 55 ; )  It was mainly a tourist outing - seeing higher level
zones for the fist time. The combination of Jboots and a Circlet that had
clickable Gather Shadows made him the perfect tour bus even though Dark Elf.

Encounters were handled in a remarkably unsubtle manner as befitting an ex
melleer: Root, Cascading Darkness, Envenomed Bolt and  Defluxxing till they
drop. Until the relatively meagre HP bar is grown accustomed to, finishing
with deflux seems to be the way to go as that HP bar moved pretty quick when
tagged.

I am taking for granted this brute force approach won't work on dark blues -
ooh but it was nice to see Grimfeathers light blue corpse smoldering without
a scratch though, finally some payback for his treatment of my Ranger : )

The Lich/Deflux combo is very sweet -  the pet hardly had a chance to get a
few swings in and there were a few light blues as well as high greens. Dang
that 49 pet is tough, and when it is Aug'd is damn hard to pull aggro off
even when using major overkill on simultaneous dot stacking and defluxxing.

Logged in at Western Commons and made a beeline for the Rathe Mountains but
was surprised to find quite a few people there so gated back to Nek and made
way to the Oasis ferry, Timorous Deep and caught the Bloated Belly to
Overthere. Jumped ship as soon as zoned and just wandered Kunark almost
aimlessly - talk about luxury: no aggro! Came accross a nice level zone for
practicing on - had high greens to low blues, including Mountain Giants,
Casting Gobbies and Burnyai (sp?) but rather uncleverly managed to forget
the name - doh.

I predict a sick day for someone at work today as "new car syndrome"
resulted in not logging out until wake up time..... oopsies.
