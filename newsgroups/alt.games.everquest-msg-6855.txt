While you will probably hate this answer, I don't believe there's any
difinitive statement to make in "monk vs. warrior" in terms of what's
better. I enjoy them both, but for different reasons. I didn't really go
"to the warrior from the monk". I have always played two characters. The
fact is, the monk is, and will remain, my primary character. However, my
hunting Parnter is Tirra (25 barbie shaman chick with a bear on her
head). We have an agreement that we only play together so that we'll
level close to evenly. The only exception is when one of us gets ahead
of the other too far, as recently through a combination of several
deaths on her part and the racial penalty she incurs in comparison to my
human monk. I was over a full level ahead, so she played with my troll
for a little while. But for the most part, we only play together. But
we're not always both online at the same time, so I keep a separate
character to play when not grouping with Tirra.
  That used to be my wizard, until the famous "near throwing the monitor
out the window" incident, when I retired him and determined that I would
start a character that would have a rat's ass chance of getting into
groups and leveling well.  Thus the troll warrior.
  I have no complaints. Jakugg has leveled very fast, and after spending
a bit of time in each new zone I find that I make friends and groupmates
quickly and dont' have trouble finding groups and hunting. I would say
that aspect is far better than even the monk, who is not *quite* as
valuable in some groups as a warrior, a cleric, or an enchanter.  
   So, I like them both. The monk, I think, is more "interesting", but
the warrior is easier to get into groups, can loot a hell of a lot more,
get's more interesting equipment, and is a blast to play in battle.
  Sorry I wasn't more help. Good luck to you. I would say don't give up
on your monk. They can be key players in the game later on, particularly
for pulling once you get Feign Death at 17.
