When I was playing pletny of people soloed, many of the first to highest 
levels were soloing.  I'd rate it about a 7.5.  Actually I probably 
soloed about 50/50...

You can 'solo' in planetside, but it's more like just tagging along with 
a bunch of other people and shooting whatever moves, so you aren't really 
'alone'.

I'd actually say city of heroes is less soloable than EQ, admittedly I've 
soloed more than I've grouped though, but I've mostly been playing the 
early levels.
