And when there is no more room in hell, Rangers shall walk Norrath.

I still think its overexaggeration on their part to scare people away.
That's worst case scenario, and yeah.. sometimes they will, but i can
guarantee you they take nights off from time to time other than just
Saturday. If not.. well then... shit.. i guess AL isn't for me either
:P. Still.. are we trying to split hairs on whose uber guild is the
uberest with the most uber requirements?

And we all know how reliable interfacing with API's can be, especially
on a proprietary program. Usually lasts until the next patch reorders
the hooks to it :>.

Ya.. that's not a very fun, or imaginative way to do it :>.
