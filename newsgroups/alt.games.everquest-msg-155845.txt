Um, isn't dealing lots of damage fast what Wizards have always been
meant to be able to do?  The only problem with Manaburn is that its
limitations (inefficiency and long reuse timer) were not sufficient
to prevent abuse in certain situations.  So instead of fixing those
particular problems, as they did successfully with CotH and Summon
Corpse for instance, they pull out the atomic nerfbat and take a
mighty swing.  Of course, in the tradition of the mighty Casey,
they missed.  There's no joy in Mudville tonight.
