I can't see this really putting those of us who like to buy and sell
completely out of business but it will have an effect.  I suppose if true,
you'll put in a desired price for an item and it will be a take it or leave
it for cash only type situation.  I can still see doing some bargain
shopping with that setup.  There will still be player to player
buying/selling negotiating, trading, regardless of what they do.  As a
matter of fact the thought of bargain shopping with players acting as "NPC
vendors" might not be that bad.  Walk up, right click, look at the items,
stats and prices and make a buy/no buy decision.
It cuts down on the tell hell situation and people working with friends to
shout fake price checks.
