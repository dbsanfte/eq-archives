How often do you deal with a GM?  Seriously, in over 115 days /played I am 
quite confident that I have submitted less than a dozen petitions, and all 
have been handled professionally, if not alwasy to my complete 
satisfaction.  I am also confident that I have had *more* interaction by 
just coming across GMs sitting in a zone and chatting with them.
