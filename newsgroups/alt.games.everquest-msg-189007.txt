If you have 512MB of RAM, you won't get a big improvement in EQ by
increasing that. With the Luclin models, EQ uses a max of around 406MB.

Considering that DirectX won't work well on a video card with less than 32MB
RAM, I'd go for the video card for the biggest impact in EQ performance.

Recommended system requirements for WinXP/2000

a.. Windows� 98/2000/ME/XP
a.. Pentium� III or greater
a.. 512 MB RAM
a.. 32 MB Direct3D compliant video card and hardware T&L (i.e. ATI Radeon or
Nvidia GeForce 2 or greater)
a.. DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card
a.. 56.6k (or faster) Internet connection
a.. 16X speed CD-ROM
a.. 1.5 GB+ hard drive space
