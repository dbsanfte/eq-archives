I'd like to hear from clerics, levels 51-57 (I think there are no
group symbol buff spells in those levels) about what symbol they cast
in pickup groups and who they cast it on.  

This issue drives me crazy, because I have around 2 k in the bank,
which will go towards sow  potions, ports, and buying dropped spells.
Hence, I cannot be generous.  :)

I know it depends on the zone you're fighting in.  I have never been
compensated in Karnor's, but gems rarely dropped there.   The one time
I was in Sebilis with a pickup group, the master looter split the gems
pretty much evenly, giving me a few extra.  This barely covered my
cost, while everyone else made a profit. Perhaps I made a mistake in
symbolling every one in the party.  

What do you other clerics do?  Ask the group up front?  Hunt only in
the most profitable places? 

For the non-clerics, are you more accepting of the fact you won't get
the more expensive symbol in pickup groups?  I know some of you carry
peridots around and offer them to the cleric upfront.  I wish all
players were like that ;)

Any advice is appreciated.
