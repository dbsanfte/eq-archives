My level 52 ranger found out last night that harmony no longer works on the
Elites / Rygorr Oracle and Chief.  So there's also a level 54 druid sitting
there staring at the fort.  We strike up a conversation.  He couldn't figure
out how to pull either.  So we warn the zone of the impending possible train
and try several tactics, none worked, several trains.  While this is going on a
necro shows up, says he's going to try and feign death on them, it failed AND
got him killed and trained the zone yet again.
What are we supposed to use to pull them?  Harsh language?  This is just CRAP I
SAY!!!
Ok, I'm done venting now...
