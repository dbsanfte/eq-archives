It's just another nail in the coffin of alchemy.  It's been damned near 
useless for some time.  If they had made the potion ingredients sell at a 
reasonable cost for what they are used for, then I could make all sorts 
of fun and useful potions.  As it is, most of the useful ones cost so 
much to make that nobody has any interest in even paying for the cost of 
making them, much less paying any kind of profit.  On a really good 
night, I might make 800pp selling potions, usually a lot less.  It's far 
from the primary thing I sell to raise cash, I'm just annoyed that it 
makes all that time and money I spent raising my alchemy even more 
useless.
