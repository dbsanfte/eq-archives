Back when EQ first started I could understand this seeing the game was 
still fetching $30 bucks, but now you can get all 6 cds for $24 off 
gogamer. Plus like I said I could give them CD keys for everything but 
the original 2.

If they really were that concerned about re-couping losses they could 
just have a service fee ( like the character name change service etc ) 
where you pay a $25 to settle the purchase of the
CD ( seeing it is only $24 for all 6 games rolled into one CD now ).

Obviously sales of accounts go on all the time and there are few rare 
occasions ( like mine ) where an issue comes up. Sony has minimal 
control over sales now and at least through acceptance they could make 
some money on it.

Pretty much everyone I know that has 2 accounts or more got them from 
someone leaving the game. The only person I know who did it legitimately 
and then tried to transfer his shaman to the new account had to pull a 
singing monkey monkey out of his butt to convince him that the original 
account was his. It seems on the billing info his old credit card had 
his middle initial on it and his new card didn't so until he provided 
the Key from the game they wouldn't transfer it
