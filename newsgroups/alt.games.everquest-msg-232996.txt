LOL oh yeah.

I remember all my old computers.

Atari 400
Atari 800 = No storage I had to type all my programs in
every time I wanted to run them.
Sinclair
TRS80
Commodore Vic 20!
Apple II+
Apple IIc
Apple IIe : Had 2 folppy drives for this one to reduce floppy swapping Woot!
Went from 48k memory and I upgraded to 64k!

Compaq 286 : A hard drive! I'm a geek now! 10mb!

PC's limited(Dell) 386/16 Mhz! I still remember one computer salesman asking
why I needed all that power! LOL! He said 386's were only for High-end
engineeering applications! ROTFLMAO! Should have seen the look on
his face when I said it was for playing games. Hehe.

386/20Mhz
486/20
486/33
486/50

Pentium 1, 2, 3 4

I've had them all hehe.
And I am thinking of upgrading again!

OMG! just think of the games and systems we will have 10 years
from now. Hell 5 years!

What gets me is after all this time. No one has come up
with a decent 3D system. Whoever does is going to make a ton
of money.
