I have some questions for all the bards out there.  What level is it
feasable to solo ALL the pieces for the Lambent Armor quest?  Most of
the groups I join in my adventures are pickup groups and the dungeons
where some of the Lambent pieces drop are usually vacant when I play. 
The zones that come to mind are Sol A and Permafrost.  Of course, when
Permafrost *IS* populated, it's usually full of high level people
taking their shots at Lady Vox.  I know there is better armor out
there and I know I could probably buy Lambent Armor, but I see the
Lambent Armor quest as a "rite of passage".  I really want to quest
for it.  By the way, my bard is Level 33.

Also, I have a question about bards that are level 50+.  On higher
level dungeon raids, do groups expect bards to twist four songs, or is
a three song twist still acceptable at those levels?  I can easily
twist three songs without any songs dropping, and I can twist four
songs with one song dropping for about a second.  For the four song
twist, I am not including the level 30 Amplification song.  With that
song, I can have five songs up for just a little bit.  8-)

By the way, the Amplification song is amazing.  I can't wait till
level 34 so I can twist Amplification, Cassindra's Chorus of Clarity,
and Cantata of Soothing.  If I'm not mistaken (according to info on
eqdiva.com) with that twist I can help casters regenerate mana at
around 15 mana a tick.
