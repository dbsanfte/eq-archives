For those of us who twink, sometimes you would like to take some quested
(and often no-drop) gear and gift it to your new alt. Let's say the
quest requires four items to be turned in to the quest NPC in order to
get the quest gear. Three of them are real bastards to get for a low
level character (if not outright fucking impossible) but one of them is
either not a no-drop item, or easy to get. (e.g. the shadow silk for the
items in question, which a level one could make with a sufficiently high
tailoring skill and some easy to get components.) If you have a high
level character that can go collect the three hard to get items, and
take that high level along with the twink to the quest NPC, the high
level turns in the three tough items and stops. Then the twink turns in
the last item. Whoever turns in the last item gets the quest gear.
That's multi-questing in a nutshell.
