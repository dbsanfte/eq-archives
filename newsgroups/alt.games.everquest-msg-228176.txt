No, I'm trying to say that if you go only where you want, you are being 
greedy.  But self serving would be an excellent synonym.

If you go where I want and where you want and where others want, then 
you aren't being self serving... or possibly you are.  If the deal is 
explicit, then its in your enlightened self interest.  If its implicit, 
it is also.

I'm using the word Greed because its a rough fit and because its the 
word used in "need before greed", despite being pejorative.  Which is 
where my whole "reflexive word" line came from.

I wisely select the optimal course of action
You pick missions designed to help you
He is a self serving scum that only does -his- sort of mission.
