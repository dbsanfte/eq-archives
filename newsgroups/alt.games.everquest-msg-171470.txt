I seem to recall that the minimum level to do that quest is 36.  Could be
mistaken.  If that is indeed the case, he first has to get to 36 somwhere.
Personally, I suggest dungeons, but, you will have to BYOG for many of them.
Alternatively, Marus Seru or Dawnshroud Peaks are possibles.  There are
really quite a few zones that are appropriate for that level range.

According to EQAtlas:
Warsilk Woods
Lake of Ill Omen
Oasis of Marr
Ocean of Tears
SolA
Echo Caverns
Grimling Forest
Marus Seru
Twilight Sea
Dalnir
Rathe Mountains
Mistmoore
Overthere
Timourous Deep
Stonebrunt Mountains
Eastern Wastes
Iceclad Ocean
Frontier Mountains
Dawnshroud Peaks
Kaesora
Firiona Vie
Tower of Frozen Shadow
Mons Letalis
Scarlet Desert
Kithicor Forest
Crystal Caverns
Kedge Keep
Splitpaw
Trakanon's Teeth
Mines of Nurga
Thurgadin
Tenebrous Mountains
Permafrost
Lower Guk
Great Divide

These would be zones for 31-39.
