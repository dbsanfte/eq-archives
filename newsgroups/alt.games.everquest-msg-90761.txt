None that I know of.  You should try "/who all GUILD" instead though, or
'/who all " Winters of Discontent"'  I think you will have more success that
way.  The spaces around the first quote are required when doing it by guild
name.  You could also just try talking in Guild chat, and asking if anyone
is out there.
