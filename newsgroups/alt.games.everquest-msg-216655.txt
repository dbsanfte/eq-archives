Actually no I havent had this happen. Im always careful to explain to the
group that we need to wait and be totally prepared before we enter the
dungeon. I guess Ive grouped with  good people , as there have been no
accidental zone-ins before people were ready.

If the cleric isnt FM then you arent "good to go".  To my mind the cleric
simply isnt "good to go" unless he/she is FM. Tanks and others that dont
have to blow a large chunk of mana buffing others just need to be patient.
Most tanks undestand this, and in my experience the ones that dont arent
worth grouping with.

?? huh ? Care to explain that one ? You could wait for 29 of the 30 minutes
to expire and it still would make zero difference in the time your given to
complete the dungeon.

*shrug* Started playing on Vallon, since thats where I have RL friends. When
I get tired of the PvP bs ( a more and more frequent occurance lately ) then
the wife and I go play our beastlords on Torvon.
