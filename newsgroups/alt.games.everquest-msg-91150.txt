Look, I understand all this emotion, but you're bypassing the point:
Granted, I do not hit double 110 all time, normally it's asynchronous,
like a 90/57 hit etc. You are dancing around here though. My point is
not about 'look how uber my SK is'. The point is that this SK *very
easily* covers 1000 damage very fast.
The rest of your arguments are nearly futile: Mobs do not run around
corners and fetch trains in every normal exp camp. Andin case you
forgot: SK's can snare with their darness line of spells. In addition,
there's quite often a ranger or druid (yes a druid) in the groups I
was in. If not, a cleric or a shammy rooting and so on. Don't
emphasize this 'final blast' thing so much, it's totally not needed in
about any group. If it was different, wizards would be a strongly
needed class andin every group, not? As for your comparison between
melees: What does this have to do with wizards. Monks hit more often.
Your point?

Sad to see you miss the point completely. Again.
