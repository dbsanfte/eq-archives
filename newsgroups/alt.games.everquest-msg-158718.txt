Also, for those who wanted to make a character specificly for the
ability to port...  Wizards were/are unpopular in groups and were/are
a royal pain to get to a level where they can solo effectively.  And
then, just to pile it on Wizards do not get a port to the Freeport
area until L34 (even on servers like mine where GBay was the auction
zone instead of EC there were always a lot of people looking for ports
to WC from all over).  It's a lot easier to get a Wizard to 29+ now,
you can come up with quite a bit of +HP/+MANA gear and some focus stuff
pretty inexpensively, so even a low budget twink can do pretty well.
