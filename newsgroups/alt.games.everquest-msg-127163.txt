Tunare's Request is the charm, level cap of 45 though.

Winged Death was my motivation to get 53, and then Form of the Howler
(breeze mana regen wolf form) to 54.  Now I want 55 so I can scribe Tunare's
Request and Nature Walker's Behest (2 yellow 3 blue into 54 and it sucks
massively)

I'm glad SoE doesn't give Ultravision, it's bad enough to have on the wolf
form (that I only use for mana regen).
