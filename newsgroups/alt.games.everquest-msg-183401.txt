Speaking as a 55 Paladin, I'd say it was almost certainly a pointless
waste of time to hold pulls to get mana for your Paladin, even if you
didn't have any KEI'd caster(s).  The cases where a Paladin's mana
supply is critical to group success are uncommon and usually have to
do with odd group make-up (Paladin as primary healer), or fighting
casters that you simply <must> prevent from casting).  At a guess,
I'd bet your Paladin was spending his mana to little effect, and if
he was casting Yaulp I'd amend that to very nearly zero effect.
There's no particular reason everybody else should be sitting around
just because the Paladin hasn't learned to manage his mana yet, and
it could well be counter-productive to his education to indulge him
by holding pulls while he meds.  When grinding with a Cleric in the
group there just isn't much need for a Paladin to cast anything
other than the occasional stun as needed to hold agro (if the Paladin
is MT) and the occasional stun or root to assist with CC or get a mob
off a caster or maybe a patch heal once in a while when the Cleric is
LOM or busy keeping somebody else alive.  And since the latter uses
are as needed and/or in emergency, a Paladin who runs himself OOM
casting unnecessarily during normal fighting is, IMO, cheating the
group of half of his utility.
