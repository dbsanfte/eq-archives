    Well, they are blue to red to him; lt. blue to blue to me.   He's 32 now and
I'm 46, so I don't think that we're talking a huge range here.  Still, the
giants we were fighting in the Great Divide today proved that they could easily
chew him up when I went on a mini strike after he declared in the AGE channel
that since he had life taps, he didn't need me any more.

   Could be, but my necro was able to routinely feign red mobs off of her (I
live dangerously).  But it is something to keep in mind, so thanks for passing
it along so when it does happen to us, we can reflect upon this warning.
