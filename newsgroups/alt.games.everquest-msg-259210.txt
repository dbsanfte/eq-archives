Thanks 

One additional question - is there a wiz board somewhere ?

Making bows for my ranger was taking time - but it seems that
research for a wiz is more than that. I asked 3 high level wizards
this evening and they all was a big questionmark, when i asked about
how they had raised skill combining and what items they used.
Noone was aware that you have to use the Lexicon.
So i quess researching for getting your spells was something you did
in the pre-bazaar time.
First i have to make Azia and Beza practise Runes (which consist of several componets)
and then combine with several other components..just to raise a skill-level.
Is it really true or do i get this wrong ?

Kim
