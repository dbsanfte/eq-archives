I got the 128MB version, found it through Pricewatch.  When I checked 
around on performance differences between the 128 and 256, they were very 
minimal, so I saw no reason to spend the extra money.  Don't recall off 
hand which shop I bought if from, but it was through Pricewatch.  Right 
now, the cheapest they show is $151.  Be sure to double check that it is 
the 9800 Pro you are looking at if you go to purchase it.
