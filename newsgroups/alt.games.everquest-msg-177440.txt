Opal steins can only go in the primary & secondary slots, and +10 int &
str is nothing to sneer at either considering you can put it in your
ranged slot.  If you are capable of charming that's some serious
boosting, 100 cha with the opal stiens & trophy, or you can put
something more useful in your hands.  Being an enchanter I can't wait to
get it, I'm just scraping the money togeather right now for the last
bit.  Once I get it I'll finally be able to drop a bunch of low level
crap like my opaline earrings and upgrade.
