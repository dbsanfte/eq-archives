Has anyone tried using 3D-Analyze to run the Luclin or Planes expansions?

I'm playing Kunark on a Toshiba Satellite 1135-S135 laptop with a 64MB 
onboard graphics chip (Intel 82852/82855 GM/GME graphics controller).  It 
doesn't support hardware T&L, so it looks like I wouldn't be able to play 
SoL or PoP on it.

I was hoping there might be some kind of software T&L emulator available, 
but all I've been able to find is 3D-Analyze.  Apparently, it will trick EQ 
into thinking my graphics card has T&L so the game will run, but doesn't 
actually emulate T&L.

Anybody had any luck with this?

Here's a link to 3D-Analyze (the page is in German but the program's in 
English):
