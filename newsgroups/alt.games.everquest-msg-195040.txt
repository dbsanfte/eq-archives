When soloing for melee skill-ups this works well for me:
- pull with disease DoT (much longer duration than poison DoT),
- slow on incoming
- poison DoT
- melee down, reapply poison DoT and heal self if/as necessary,
   (At various times I've fought relatively tough mobs when hunting
   for melee skill-ups, for these it is very handy that the poison
   DoT is shorter duration than slow, when it wears off it is time
   to recast slow, then recast poison.  Don't have to do this much
   anymore as I have a decent weapon now (10/25 piercer) and get
   good skill-ups against mid-blues)
- root on flight if letting the mob run is a bad idea

When soloing purely for xp, I will alternate the above with straight
rotting (disease DoT, poison DoT, root, reapply DoTs/root as nec.)
as it seems to work out best for efficient use of hp/mana (he's a
Troll, so 6hp/tick sitting regen, and he has a 10/25 piercer that
actually does noticeable damage against the mobs I fight at L22).

Druid/Ranger roots hold better than generic, which is nice.  Druid
swarm-type DoTs have a -100 to the resist (I have only ever had two
resists of swarm-type DoTs in 37 levels with my Druid on FV, and
one of those I'm pretty sure the mob was too high), which makes their
efficiency fantastic (my Druid on FV hardly ever uses his fire-based
DoTs, those resists really cut down on the mana efficiency).

Where it hurts is if you're fighting high MR mobs (or mobs that are
higher level than you are), which resist and break root a lot anyway,
it really sucks to give them an extra resist check with a bonus.

Well, it might work for you, I dunno.  But if I wanted to play a Bard
then I would make a Bard.  :-p

I like hunting in the old world, and it cheeses me off to have to
run from those scummy little asslings instead of just sauntering
past them invisibly.

Don't forget that already by your mid-teens real melees are usually more
effective than you.  Use the DoT because it is cheap damage, keep the
melees healthy so they keep fighting.  The main difference between you
and Cleric at low level is that you have SoW, which is good for pulling,
and you have lots of buffs (including SoW) the melees will want you to
waste mana on, so you end up medding to recover from placating the
melees (I'll give 'em AGI and DEX for skill-ups, and SoW because they
whine a lot without it, and Serpent Sight if they're night-blind, but
unless I'm duoing I don't generally give STR or STA because they don't
really have much effect).

Your poison DoT is short enough duration to use when MA calls assist,
unless the mobs are total wimps and die in 20 seconds (or you're
grouped with 4 Rogues, heh).
