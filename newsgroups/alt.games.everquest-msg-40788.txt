This is not exactly correct. ID works only if other special attacks are not
grayed out when the kick finally goes off. When I want it to work, in
conjunction with Flying kick, what I do is hit FK , count to 4 and then hit
ID. Flying kick will still be grayed out but will recycle before the ID kick
and if the ID skill check is successful, I get to hit a mob in the ass for a
while. Works best if you have sow on and can keep up with them or even
better are teaming with someone who can snare them. I use it a lot killing
HG's in Rathe. Even though they are green to me now, HG's hit damn hard and
even being feared for 10 or 20 seconds means a huge difference in the damage
I take. My ID skill is up to 200 though and I frequently get more than one
fear off per fight. I think the most I ever did was fear a Mountain Brea in
OT four times in one fight, of course one of them only lasted like 2
seconds. Sometimes fear last quite a while, others it hardly last long
enough for the mob to begin running away before it wears off.
