Fortunately, bards get a variety of DOT songs, and while one version of a given song doesn't stack
with others singing the same song, they do all stack with each other.

So you have one bard singing snare, fear, dissonance; the second singing three chants, the third
singing two more chants and haste, and the forth singing... hmm he's got nothing to do  Oh, bellows
bellows bellows bellows with the occaisional Amplification thrown in.  Anyway, all four also doing
melee damage on the unprotected hindquarters of the slowly fleeing mob.  Bellows guy is on crowd
control duty as he's producing less damage than the rest... but unlike the rest he isn't having to
juggle drums and weapons, so his total damage contribution is probably still up in the interesting
range.

Llyric, 41 bard, Morell Thule... just one level shy of the new PoP dot!
