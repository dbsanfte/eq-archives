As far as I know this is the way it has "always" worked: light giving items
need to either be on you (e.g. armor or shield) or directly in an inventory
slot, not enclosed in a bag.

Also, there used to be a bug that if you had two light giving sources in
inventory slots (say a beetle eye and a GLS) you got LESS light than if 
you had one!  My human druid had upgraded to a GLS and kept muttering about
how he still couldn't see anything... until he was shuffling junk at the 
bank and happened to put the beetle eye in inventory.  Don't know if they
ever fixed this but it's something to watch out for.

Just leave the GLS directly in an inventory slot (e.g. have 7 backpacks and
a GLS).
