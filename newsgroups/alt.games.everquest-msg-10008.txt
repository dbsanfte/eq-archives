You may want to add that the Rod of Insideous Glamours is +12 Cha and
+2AC, so it a nice thing for an enchanter to have in hand. I remember
asking another enchanter friend of mine, (who was sporting two steins),
if he wanted to go get one, he replied that he like his crude stein. I
like mine also, and am usually wielding both.
