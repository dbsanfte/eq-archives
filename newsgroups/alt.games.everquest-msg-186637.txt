It *is* possible to fish on the OOT boat, and perhaps others. I've done
it. I haven't figured out the rules yet, but there's a fine line between
"must be on dry land" and "fishing for land shark?". I just hang out at
the entrance to the ship and fish. If you get the "you can't do that"
message, shift a pixel or two. If it works, stay there and fish until it
stops working. It helps to be in Walk mode. Expect to get a real fishing
attempt about, oh, 20 percent of the time. It's a major exercise in
frustration, to be honest, but it can be done.
