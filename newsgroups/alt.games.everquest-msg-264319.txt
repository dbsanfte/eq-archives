Never heard of them either. /shrug

Aye, from AGE, which is where any tone I may have adopted has been 
developed. So your examples reflect some five groups at most, more likely 
just a couple. Yeah, I guess that's broader.

Ya know, there's a way to twist just about anything into an insult if 
that's what you want. My wife makes playful sport of it with me, much to 
my chagrin. However, I guess if the shoe fits...

There's a *huge* difference between calling someone a fuckwit and merely 
accusing them of resorting to insults. A little less drama please.

You'd be wrong. I can only guess that you say that because you feel *you* 
would be thinking it if you were in my shoes. Interesting...

It's no game. It's decorum and common decency. As I said, it's not the 
way mature and civilized dialog is conducted. As soon as one side decides 
they have such little respect for the other that they stoop to insults, 
then the discussion should be abandoned.

I frequent AGE to supplement my gaming interests. I don't really look to 
Usenet for much else. At most you can claim that we're out of my element 
with regard to the gaming group in which I spent my time. I don't care 
about the anti-Jewish or any other sociopathic crap out there and don't 
see it's relevance here. Familiarity with that element is not what I 
would use to measure someone else's credibility.
