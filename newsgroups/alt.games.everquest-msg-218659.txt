With a mindset like that you would have made a great Nazi. Hitler would 
have made you an officer.

Sometimes your own country goes down the wrong road... its your 
responsibility as a citizen to protest it... and your duty as a human 
being not side with a madman out of some sort of misplaced patriotism.

Love the ideal of the nation, not the leader, because the leaders, 
particularly dubya couldn't reliably draw me a roadmap to the local 7-11 
nevermind one to 'world peace'.. what with declaring war on anyone who 
disagrees with him... you'd think he'd see the irony of beating 
terrorists by becoming one.
