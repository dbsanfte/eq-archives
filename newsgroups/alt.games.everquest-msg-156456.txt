Well yes, but inefficient.  Int gives you mana based on your level, such
that at 25 you get about 5 points per int, and at 50 you get about 10 points
per int.  At level 1 you get closer to one point per int... which isn't bad
mind you, but its not astounding.

Fairly cheaply, you can pick up +mana gear that means what it says,
five pieces of +50 mana gear would double the mana pool of that
character.

Of course the int gear will grow in effectiveness as you level up, while
the mana gear will remain just what it is, so you'll feel like your mana
pool is gradually shrinking if you've invested in mana gear instead of
int gear.

I'll tell you something far more paradigm busting though... mana pool
doesn't matter much.  Every point of mana you spend has to be
medded back up.  Spend a 60 mana out of a pool of 100 mana,
and you will be on your butt medding for 60 seconds after the fight.
Spend a 60 mana out of 300 mana and you will STILL be
on your butt medding for 60 seconds after the fight.  With the
larger pool you could do several fights in a row before going
OOM, but then you'd be medding for five minutes after the
fight... same proportion.

What really helps is focus gear, which cuts down your mana
spent, or gives you more effect for the mana you do spend,
and mana flow increase items, which cause you to get mana
back faster.  Spend 50 points instead of 60, and then get
mana back 10% faster... now you are looking at 45 seconds
medding it back instead of 60, thats an improvement!
