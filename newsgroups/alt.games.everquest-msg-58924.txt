Powerleveling is totally another story...  I don't mind PL folks if that is
what they want to do...  UNLESS they are impacting straight players.

Example: CB.  A PL moves in and starts his target up in one of the most
popular lowbie hunting zones around slaughtering virtually everything "TR IS
CAMPED <by a level 11 and his PL host>.  Yeah right.  Block a group of early
to mid teens from hunting so you can solo the castle...

I've broken those camps before.  Want to see a PL lose it?  Have a high
level druid show up and single shot or AE with 400+ or 600+ damage spells.
Even if the PL host can out power you,  the person being power leveled can
gain no EXP when the area is in contention between 2 high levels.

On my server, I've told folks where they can easily go for powerleveling.
Take the target to lesser faydark or hit permafrost or any other not so
heavily hunted area like those and let them juice up without impacting folks
who are trying to game straight fashion.  There really is no good excuse for
moving into one of the popular areas to do it except laziness or just
inconsideratenes.
