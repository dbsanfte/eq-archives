Actually, if the guy exploiting the save spot were to try to argue
with me that he had every right to do so, I'd be just as irritated at
him. As with the EBayers, it's not so much the act itself but the
mentality that they're above the rules. Someone who'll sit there and
tell me "I should be allowed to do this because if Verant didn't want
me to do it they'd fix it NOW, fuck what the rules say!" is an
absolute moron, that simple.

I see someone exploiting a safe spot, I /petition it then go about my
business. It's not something that really has a majorly negative effect
on my gameplay. It's not a bug that leaves my character powerless or a
zone-crash bug or anything like that...
