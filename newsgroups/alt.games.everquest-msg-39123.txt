I guess that explains it... LOIO, in spite the asshole overload it
contains, is an absolute masterpiece of zone design, capable of
sustaining up to 200 people without feeling overcrowded, and without too
much killstealing. It has good hunting for levels 1 to 50 (admittedly,
there is a gap between 35 and 40-something), and it's very nice-looking
to boot, with plenty of variety. Stonebrunt is supposed to be modelled
on LOIO, but it doesn't come anywhere close, in my humble opinion.

Don't get me wrong, I really appreciate the fact that we get free
content with certain regularity, but I personally don't think Stonebrunt
meets their declared goal of becoming the next LOIO.

Er... The "newbie" zone in Velious, by "newbie" meaning that my lvl 34
druid needs a new pair of undies every time I port there.
