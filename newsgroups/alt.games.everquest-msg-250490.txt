The way you jump over lines is the reason you landed in my killfile in the
first place.  I let you out after a week, which is my normal practice.  You
may be about to land back in there, which I'm sure will keep you up at night
crying in your drink of preference.

If you're looking for a fight, you won't find one here.  Assuming you're
not, let me lead you by the nose.

Running their client in a window has absolutely nothing to do with buying
and selling account as far as damage to their game.

However ... (are you listening?) ...

SOE said for years that their client could not be run in a windowed
environment.  Then along came EQWindows, from a third party, and proved that
it could be done.  EQWindows thrived.  SOE tried to make running third party
apps a bannable offense.  That proved to be unenforcable.  So suddenly one
day their devs came up with a 'breakthrough' that allowed their client to be
run in windowed mode.

Do you see a pattern of behavior here, or does someone need to draw you a
map?

SOE says that buying and selling of plat and items is a bannable offense.
They manage to browbeat Ebay into stopping the sale, then Yantis and
playerauctions.com srping up.  Yantis and playerauctions.com thrived.  SOE
takes a stab at banning accounts, and finds the practice to be a great deal
of overhead ... therefore unenforcable.  Then one day someone around a
conference room table goes, "A-ha!  We can get into the plat, items, and
accounts market.  We'll put IGE and playerauctions.com out of business and
keep the cash for ourselves!".  Much harumphing later, polls being to
appear.

Once a road is travelled down that first time, it's much easier to go down
it a second.  Only difference I see here from the SOE perspective is the
cash involved.

This says nothing to the damage to the game, which I honestly think would be
minimal.  It's already happening and they're powerless to make it go away.
If SOE could stop IGE and playerauctions.com, they'd have done so by now.
