A young teen male in my region just commited suicide about a week ago.
Apparently he was bullied to death. . .

The culprit? A little 5'4 girl around the boy's age. 

According to numerous sources, this girl was part of a huge gang that
is known to cause trouble. She bullied this boy to death. She would
routinely beat him up, but the boy refused to fight back, saying, "I
won't fight a girl." This girl then went on to say that if he told
anyone about her beating him up, she would then say she tried to
defend herself against a rape.

She also threatended the boy into stealing money for her, saying that
if he didn't do it, her and her gang of gals would abuse him more.

Eventually, he had enough of it and commited suicide. 

The moral of the story is, does the law and the ever increase of
feminism protect girls TOO WELL?

You see it many times in court, if there is an assault case, male vs
female, the male is ALWAYS at fault due to the size differential. IMO,
the law is becoming quite a joke if size difference, sex, and age
determines who is at fault. There should exist no such prejudism in
the law. . . A girl with a knife or gun or fists, can kill and hurt
just as bad as a man with a gun or knife or fists. . .

This sexism that now exists in the law in quite apalling! Also, let's
not forget, a girl is capable of no wrong doing with the defense, "I
was raped or sexually harassed." Simply put, females can now use the
feminism that has invaded the law, and get cleared away with wrong
doing. . . This girl who bullied, knew very well she could get away
with it simply because she is a girl and he is a boy. She was using
her smallish feminine figure to her ADVANTAGE.

Sorry feminists, but it seems to me, it's the little girls who abuse
via their size, not the big strong men. . .
