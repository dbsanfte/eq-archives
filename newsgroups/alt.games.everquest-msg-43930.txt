<grin>

I even found the EQTraders to be less than printer-friendly, but having Office 2000
helps, as with a little work in Front Page, you can remove a lot of the ink-draining
graphic elements and still have all of the critical text. There are plenty of free or
cheap HTML editors out there if you don't happen to have Front page laying about on
your hard disk, or at least near enough to install it.
