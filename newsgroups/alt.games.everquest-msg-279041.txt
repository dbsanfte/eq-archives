As the others have responded its probably power or heat related. Either 
your system is overheating and protection circutry is cutting in... or 
your system is running hard drawing lots of power, and the extra heat is 
causing the fans to kick in and/or run faster drawing EVEN more power 
and your dying or inadequate or craptastic Power supply is cutting out.

In rare situations its something more exotic like blown caps on the MB, 
or bad connections shorting out on the video card (that separate when it 
reaches a certain temperature, etc...) but your first culprits are heat 
and power issues.

good luck
