Totally disagree.  Those "small" heals (almost 1k a heal...) are what keeps
the main tank alive upon first agroing the mob (there isnt a cheal rotation
going at this point)

Once the cheal rotation is in flow then maybe its not so vital, but another
NT on each flurry is never a bad thing

Why?  If your raiding kael then the mobs arent mezzable anyway.. or ToV.. or
most high end raid zones for that matter.  So whats wrong with a dot'd mob
while an extra tank is split tanking?

As for the other comment about kill time making dots innefective.. how many
nToV /Vindi/statue/Tormax type mobs do you kill in under 1 minute? Or even
under 2 minutes?

> I agree that healing needs to be improved.

What do you want, cheal?
The average well geared 60 monk/ranger/paladin/etc is between 4 and 5k HP,
thats what, 4 heals to make then considerably near to full HP again (you
wouldnt start casting when they had 0 hp...)

Classe uses are situational... I rarely group with Paladins (read: never
ever) but when im in nTov, I *love* a paladin groupie - what other zones are
their group heals worth shit in?
