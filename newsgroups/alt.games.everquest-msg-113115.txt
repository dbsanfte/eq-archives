Yeah, you will notice in my post I said "slight XP bonus" I know that by
itself, it doesn't magically make you get more xp per kill, but it does
*assist* in you getting more XP.

I think the main factors here are really that having a 6th is a good
practice when
A: You have lots of mobs you can kill or
B: The mobs are tough for your group to kill with only 5

Personally, I only turn people away if my group is really overkill for what
we are hunting. For instance, ran down to lguk the other day to grab an item
for our groups cleric. Was just a DRU, PAL and CLR, and we were definite
overkill for the camp we were in. At one point, cleric went AFK thru an
entire spawn. a bit later, someone came and asked to join and we turned them
down, just because there was really no point. If I'd known them I'd have
invited them and THEN told them how much overkill we were :)
