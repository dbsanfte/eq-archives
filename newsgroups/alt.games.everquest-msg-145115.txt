   This post is completely off topic, and is just me venting.  Lenny got
hit by a runaway parked car tonight while he was sitting on his bike,
and I got punched in the face when I tried to get the license number of
the car that did it.  We're both fairly ok, if shaken.  Lenny isn't
going to be doing any dancing any time soon, or indeed, much walking. 
We just got out of spending 10 hours in an ER room (it's not Just Like
the Series).
   I've been awake about 34 hours straight (well, I took a one and and
half hour nap yesterday), I'm bone tired,  and yet keyed up.  And I'm
thinking that a cold beer might be a Good Thing right now.  Lenny seems
to be enjoying his, in a comatose sort of way.
   Oh, and the bad guys got away.
