Often spend 5k+ on things you've never heard of? If so then you are far more
affluent in game than I am.

I pretty much know the stats of all the buyable items in my price range, if
they are new and useful to me the chances are they'll also be more plat than
they are worth.
If I saw someone auctioning an item I had never heard of I may ask for stats
what I wouldn't do is ask to see it in a trade window, which is the part you
missed, I have no problem giving out info but I will not stick it in a trade
window just so someone can look at it because the chances are I couldn't
afford it. Oh, of course I used to do this but I can honestly say not once
did the enquiry become a sale.

How would I know if I wanted it or not, because when I buy for me I know
what I am looking for and often pay full price for it. I have never bought
anything new. New drops are expensive and I'd rather wait till they become
last seasons favourites and the price has dropped, so I'd say it is
unreasonable that I would find myself in a situation where I didn't know
what I was buying, and if I did, I can always ask, I don't need to be shown.
