Others have answered your question, but I have a couple things to add.

1) You must have the advanced luclin graphics for your race and gender 
turned on.  With the original graphics, no horse.  For other people, 
this is fine, you just see them standing around and moving a little 
oddly.  You must also have the last one turned on, I think its "horses 
and elementals".

2) you must have a buff slot open.  The horse will show up, not only 
graphically, but as a buff icon.  Click off the icon and the mount goes 
away.  If you don't have room, no mount.  For normal users this is a 
mere annoyance, but when using up your single charge of an item, well, I 
  don't know if it does but it sure would suck to see it eat the charge 
and not give you the mount.
