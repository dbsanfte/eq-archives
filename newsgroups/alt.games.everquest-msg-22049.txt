I get a little upset sometimes because I have a friend who makes fun of 
me for immediately asking "what's the looting rules?"  I mean - I want to 
*know* because yes, I DO usually want to loot (it's not QUITE so bad now 
that I've managed to buy back that Staff of Writhing I lost in a 
dimensional pocket and had to buy back for a friend *g* Yay yay yay!), 
and no, I DON'T want to step in and hear "Hey, bitch, that was mine!"

I've known people who have wanted to roll for derv rings.  *g*

Fortunately for greedy little me, most people don't care and I loot away 
:)  I keep auto-split cash on though, and what REALLY bugs me is when the 
group leader will say "everybody make sure you've got auto-split on" and 
then you see someone looting and you're not hearing any change noises "Do 
you have autosplit on, a_looter_01?" "Uh-huh." (7 corpses later and not a 
copper on em? Hmmmmm....)  Sure it's only a few coppers, but I find it 
horribly rude that someone would deceive the whole group just to GET 
those few coppers in addition to the bronze weapons they're scooping 
up... maybe they should make auto-split mandatory :p
