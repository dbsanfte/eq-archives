I think in many cases its not being used to "negate" the insult, but
to add to it. In other words its not a smiley, its a smirkey. :-p

However, I also think a lot of people do it unconsciously, and tend to
believe those who cover insults in smileys where they're inappropriate
(smirkies) are probably the sort of snot I would dislike in real life
as well.

It's interesting you say that. Your text comes off as condescending
and a little snobbish because of how dry it sounds. The inclusion of a
smiley here and there would totally alter the feel of it.

It goes back to something earlier in the thread - you said smileys are
unnecessary in the face of superior writing. I would now counter that
with: some people's writing obviously isn't as superior as they think.
The alternative is you really mean to be as pompous as you sound.... 

*shrug*
