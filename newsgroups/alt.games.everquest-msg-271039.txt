A client of mine got bit last month by a Promise FasTrak100TX2 array that refused to
accept a new disk for the mirror.  Tried with a couple of different drives.  I finally had
to use PQIDeploy to do a sector-by-sector image of the known good disk, then recreate the
pair, and restore the image.  Luck was definitely a factor.  /shrug

That was more or less my point.  I bow to your eloquence ;->

I agree in theory: anything that makes long sequential pulls from the disk will bog things
down in this situation.  Digital video editing, multi-track sound recording and WAV
editing are some non-scientific apps that can drag down a disk subsystem.  Ditto for large
static image manipulation.

That being said, how big are the EQL texture cache files?

I see it as the RAID controller offloading to the CPU.  For example, the soggiest
performance is typically encountered when opening ADUC.  Reading the AD into memory is
surely a nice, big wallop to the disk subsystem.
