I like LDoNing, and it can be tough to get a group, particularly if
you want to do a hard.  But solo LDoN?  Seems like once you go that
far, you might as well just play a single-player game.  I've gone back
to Icewind Dale Heart of Winter just for those times when I feel like
playing single-player.  Certainly there are lots of single-player
games that are more fun than solo EQ.
