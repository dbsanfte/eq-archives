If I understand the information on the website, it doesn't resize the 
desktop. It resizes the *image* of the desktop then places other 
applications' output in the area this creates. Windows is completely 
unaware that anything is different because the desktop hasn't actually 
changed.

I have to agree here. Since the program operates at the driver level, any 
errors it may cause would most likely be extremely unpleasant. (Read that 
as GPF, BSOD, etc.)

I don't think this would be terribly useful to EQ players. While it would 
indeed be very handy, the website seems to indicate a need for a xSides 
server to host the applications which appear it the xSides display area. 
This seems to indicate it is entirely a "push" technology. At the very 
least you would need another machine to function as a xSides server.

Personally, I find this to be an interesting but likely to be abused 
technology. It seems that the end user has no control over what appears in 
the xSides area. This appears to be control via the xSides server. I could 
be wrong about this though...

Not an issue if Windows itself is unable to detect it. See my previous 
comment.

I like this one myself. I have this very setup. Incredibly handy for 
research, or simple web browsing while I'm medding.
