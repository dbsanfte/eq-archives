You're a shorty...you aren't going "fast" enough to climb off
the ladder when sneak/hiding.

My primary rogue is a halfling.  When he was hunting his
THB he was also camping the RBF in the squire room...he'd
have to drop sneak/hide long enough to get up the ladder
and then re-sneak/hide.

My secondary rogue (now my "main," Gerry only comes
back around for raids), a half-elf, has no problems getting
on or off those ladders, Upper or Lower Guk.

Get some gnome to tinker you some stilts, dwarf :-)
