Using the old info from http://www.geocities.com/sstair/EverQuest/

I have heard 2 rumors that 1 point AA is equal to 1 level 50 or one level 51.

For level 50 you need 10,291,400 exp points or to solo kill 54 even con mobs at 50.
For level 51 you need 23,976,500 exp points or to solo kill 122 even con mobs at 51.

This assumes no race penalty. I think that an AA point is somewhere in between
these 2 from my own personal exp.
