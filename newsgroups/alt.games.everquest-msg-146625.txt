I logged on this morning at about 8 pst and petitioned. I was
contacted by a guide within 10 to 15 minutes. He/she said that if I
was not helped shortly to petition using there contact a GM option on
the website.

I stayed logged on til about 5 pst and was never contacted by a GM. I
have petitioned three times via the website and only received the
automated replies that they have received my message.

Can someone explain what they do in cases like this? Will they roll my
character back to the last save that I had my gear? Give me each piece
of gear I was wearing and replace the loot I had? I sat there the
other morning and worked on sense heading that was very neglected on
that toon and now wonder if it was all for not and will be rolled back
to it previous skill level..

Well the wait goes on..........
