    No, Dream King is saying he'll monk kite. Beat him up, Feign, then hope
his regen is faster than the lizard's regen. Stand, beat him some more,
repeat until lizard (one or the other ;-) ) is dead. Question, though:
doesn't he give bad faction hits with the lizards in Cazic Thule? I always
thought it was neat my monk could wander around in there with everything
Dubious, and wouldn't want to spoil that.

    And purple horseshoes!

    He used to drop them at a fair pace a long time ago, but that was nerfed
when necromancers started soloing the big guy. His gem drop rate isn't so
hot anymore, but he does still drop stuff.
