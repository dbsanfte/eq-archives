The only Trade skill you really need as a wizard is research the rest can be
fun.  As far as training all you damage spells are evocation so work on it.
The rest are-
Abjuration--Shielding
Alteration--Teleports and Roots
Conjuration--Familars (train with Eye of Zomm and Halo of Light)
Divanation--Invisibility

As for why your spells are interupted often you move or take damage it will
happen. PB AE spells are not stun spells also.
But all in all the best tactic for a wizard is root nuke and keep from
getting hit, and when in groups wait till the mob is down to 4 bubbles of
health (80%-70%).
