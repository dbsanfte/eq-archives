Well, I don't normally use IE, I'm one of the luddites still running
Netscape (7.1 at the moment), but of course IE is sitting on my
desktop anyway.  After reading your suggestion I went and looked at
its properties and don't see an option to set it in work offline or
work online modes.

I can say for sure that I was able to connect to EQ up thru last
January with IE configured as it is now (since I haven't touched it at
all), so if it would stop me while connected via a regular dial up
ISP, then that's probably not the problem.

Still, if you can clue me in as to how to check, I'd love to find it
was something as simple to fix as that seems to be!
