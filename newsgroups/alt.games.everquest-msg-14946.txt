Check http://everquest.allakhazam.com - their equipment lists give a
minimum level to obtain said item. They do stipulate that its an
estimate for someone of the most appropriate class to obtain *solo*, so
will likely come down a bit with a group to help. Also, tradeskill-made
items are all listed as level 1, since you could in theory build high
enough skill at level 1 if you had a rich benefactor. Don't seriously
expect to be tailoring black panther armour and crafting velium ruby
veils at level 1 though, even though it says you can.

Do a search on their quest database too, giving your class and a level
range, and it'll pull out all the quests it thinks you could manage.

Bear in mind that lots of newer quests (most of the Velious ones for
example), don't have level assessments yet, so they'll be returned by a
search regardless of any level range you've stipulated.
