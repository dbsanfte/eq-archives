It doesn't always show.  And sometimes, the true nature of a person can get
twisted and warped by the personna they exhibit online.

I fell into a more dangerous trap than a woman pretending she was physically
attractive -- a woman who feigned she was looking for a change, and that I
was the possible change.

I bear much of the responsibility for it, yes, and I'm coping with it as
best I can.  There's a woman out there in an area of the US I won't reveal
who most likely thinks nothing of this ordeal, of what I did, or of what she
did.  I'm the type who has to reflect on his mistakes and figure them out so
as to not repeat them.

A truism if I've ever heard one.
