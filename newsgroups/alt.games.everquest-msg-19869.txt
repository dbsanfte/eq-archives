Almost all dragons charm or has the potential to charm.
Not all dragons fear.  Infact, I think only a handful fear:  All three
outdoor Kunark dragons, Naggy/Vox, Whoashit, Klandicar, and Zlandicar.

Fear is weak.
Any MR over 190 will resist Fear easily (unless it's Gorenaire fear in
which case you can be level 60 with 350 MR and still get feared across
the damn zone...not broken my ass).  Tonight's Klandicar kill, with MR
at 224, I didn't even bother dropping SoW because I knew I would
resist fear reliably (or if I get feared, only for a second or two).

Zlandicar.
Disease AoE isn't that dangerous.
What makes Hoshkar a real freaking pain isn't the damage, it's the
turgur effect from the disease AoE.  When your meleers lose about 70%
of their damage output from being slowed, that dragon suddenly becomes
a HUGE pain in the ass.

Go and check out every dragon in the game, the ones which prove to be
the most annoying are generally those that has an AoE slow of some
sort.

Crown of Rile:  AC16, 20 WIS/INT/STR, 75hps/mana, 25 vs poison/magic.

In VP, yes.
In ToV, no.

ToV practically everything is using cold/fire AoEs.  So far, from what
I've seen nothing in ToV fears.  There are some VERY freaking annoying
dragons whose AoE can be rather devastating in ToV North which is
magic checked, but if you plan on doing West wing, fire/cold is all
you really need.

Huh???

There's something like 50 named dragons in WW.  Their AoE range from
freaking unresistable 400 cold based AoE, to fire, AoE silence, AoE
fear, etc...

Which WW dragon are you referring to?

>>none of the ones that people normally fight have

Klandicar fears.
Sontalak just turns you in to a messy goo real fast.

Sontalak doesn't have to fear.  He'll just flurry on you and proc his
nuke on you 8 times in a row leaving a smoking pile of dead whatever.

No specific order.
My guild's is now under a new requirement.  If you plan on being in
ToV, you're gonna need a minimum of 150 MR/CR/FR *UNBUFFED*.  Anyone
not meeting that minimum is asked to leave since I'm not having
healers waste their mana on people who consistently take full damage
from AoEs which they SHOULD be resisting.

Nope, not in my experience.
Infact, the poison checked dragons are generally the weakest of the
bunch.  Trakanon, Sev, and Whoashit, all doable with 24 or less.
