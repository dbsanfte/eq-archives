Well, I got this new computer about a week ago and I played for
several days without the firewall operating. 

But, I got parinoid remembering all the popups and spyware that ended
up on my old computer and decided I didn't want that happening on this
new computer so I activated the firewall and security parts of the
McAffee "Trial" program that came with the new system.

Since I got it all up and running it has notified me..... almost
nonstop..... of blocked attempts from a couple of computers trying to
access my system. Not that I think some derranged hacker is trying to
infiltrate *MY* little computer system but I do wonder if some of
these advertising spybot programs are not trying to be set up like
they had been on my old system. That just plain pisses me off and I
don;t want it happening again.
