I'm consumed by an overwhelming wave of tedium... 51 is going slow as 
molasses, and I have nothing to look forward to, spells-wise until at 
least 54, so I'm very keen on 1: exploring, and 2: buying myself a cool 
toy or two, if I can afford them. Of course, the ones I really want, AoN 
and Holgresh Elder Beads are way beyond my range, unless I did nothing 
but port for money for weeks on end. I think I could afford something 
like a Goblin Gazughi Ring (nice sparklies, and it could help with 
hunting in a place like EW or EJ), or a Bracer of the Hidden... Does 
anybody know of other relatively affordable pieces with "fun" effects on 
them that a Druid can use?
