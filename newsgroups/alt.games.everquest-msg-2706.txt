What do YOU base this on...? How could you say this has any more sound
basis than my statement?

...what was that about them having the right to kick you off for
whatever reason they want?

It's their property. They have every single right in the world to

An item changes hands. You're not selling your time, you're selling
the item.

The item doesn't even belong to you. You have no right to sell it.
