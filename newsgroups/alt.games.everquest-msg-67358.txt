I cannot confirm this, but I am assuming that if you do the minimal
installation, you will not need to install all 3 cds.  Now if the serial
number was under the 3rd cd, the person not doing the full install may not
know where to look for it, versus everyone that needs to install at least
the first cd.  Just my thought..
