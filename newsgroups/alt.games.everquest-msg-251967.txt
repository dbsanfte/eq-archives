Hmmm. I never looked at the code, not part of our job, but the Cray
that had 8 CPUs where I used to work would accept Cray Fortran
programs that could use anywhere from one thru 8 cpus. The only
thing I know for certain about that particular situation is that
most of the programs that used all 8 of the Cpus at the same time
had exclusive use of the computer for a certain period of time and
they used huge datasets.

Has it been tried ? I don't know.

While I understand your simile... One person, unless they are very
good at using remote control devices, cannot drive 8 cars at the
same time by themselves. However, computer programs can be written
to use however many CPUs there are in a computer. I know that
computer programs were written, to use all 8 cpus at the same time.

Hmmm. If each player character and /or a mob had its own CPU to
control its movement... Well, I don't know if Fortran, although its
possible other compilers could be installed on a Cray, could do
that, control a character per cpu. But maybe it is possible.

And maybe it isn't as important as you think. I don't know, but I'm
willing to think about it, and not be lockstepped into one version
of it.
