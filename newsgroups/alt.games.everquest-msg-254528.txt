Yes. You have to have GOD for -any- of the group abilities to have an 
effect for that group member. He still counts towards the minimum 3rd 
person to enable GOD leadership abilities for the rest of the god 
enabled group, be gets nothing himself.

Only abilities earned by the leader of the group are ever 'on'.

Exactly.

1 regen per level, +50hp/mana per level, +10 atk/level iirc.

No range limit. No level limit. (Although the restrictions on earning 
lxp are a little more stringent). I don't recall if they work accross 
zone lines offhand.

> 
> 6) what are opinions of the various leadership abilities?

The consensus is that they are low return on the investment. But I 
disgree. I agree they take a long time to get, and I agree that they are 
small bonuses... but they are permanent bonuses. I spend a week with 
with lxp on and get an lxp ability... and then i've got it for life.
+150hp and +3 regen for me and everyone in my group, that can't be 
dispelled, doesn't wear off, doesn't take a spell slot, and after its 
been earned doesn't cost anything except for people to press 'follow'. 
What reason could there be for not wanting that?

VS AAs yeah they're a lower return on time. VS gear, they are higher, as 
gear is always ephemeral. But even vs AAs... eventually you get the good 
ones, and your left getting another +2 sv poison... are you really in 
that much rush for another +2 sv poison? Might as well turn lxp on at 
that point.

Also, definately have lxp on from 1-46 or so, it slows you down 
minimally really, and if you can manage to lead groups for much of that 
time you can easily earn 4 or 5 abilities by 46.

Overall I think they're -all- modestly useful, and eventually plan to 
get all of them... i mean why not... its no more a time sink than 
anything else. :)

That's ideal yes; but even earning them in pickup groups isn't all that bad.

lxp incurrs a 20% xp penalty to the leaders regular xp, so its debatable 
whether he is getting rewarded 'more' :)

In typical pickup groups if people are collecting leadership they 
usually just ask to be made leader while you xp.

If the group leader (ie the person forming, and actually leading the 
group is collecting lxp nobody usually contests it... and if the leader 
isn't collecting or doesn't have GoD they don't usually mind handing the 
'title' over to someone who is. (If multiple people want it, then they 
just random it)
