    It's sad how many quests must be unsolved in Kunark that nobody cares
about because "the next best thing" is out. I seem to remember an "unsolved
mysteries of Norrath" page - anyone have that URL? It'd be worth dumping all
the items with no known use in Kunark on that page, just to have a source
for them. I'd bet money that the majority of undiscovered quests have
something to do with the evil Outpost, too - there were never any major
quests found associated with it, like there were with FV, and you'd think
they'd at least TRY to balance the quests out. Then, once everyone had
trashed their VS faction, nobody bothered looking anymore.

    Off the top of my head, there's the skull container off the Cook in
Kurn's Tower, the aforementioned Dragon Crystals, and the skeleton on top of
the ship the Overthere Hammer teleports you into. Hmm. Skull container, four
slots. Four dragon crystals. The skeleton crushes things given to him "like
he doesn't notice them", and the OT hammer quest originally could only be
done by level 50 plus players with high OT faction. The way you get the OT
hammer is to hand the quest NPC skeleton gems for eyes, so he can see.
Hmm.... now if only I had someone with high OT faction to do this. :-/
