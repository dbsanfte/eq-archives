You can disagree until your brain flows out of your ears and down your
collar, but the *fact* remains that pure number crunching managed to
beat creativity and skill in a rather unambiguous manner. In a few years
time, you won't need Deep Blue, any off-the-shelf chess program running
on a desktop PC will be able to beat a human Grandmaster.

What irks me the most, though, is all this "humans vs. computers"
bollocks. Computers are *us*, they are *our* tools. Why doesn't anybody
talk about "humans vs. dump trucks" when it comes to hauling gravel, and
yet everybody brings it up when it comes to Chess? It is, at the end of
the day, the same thing: A problem, and a tool to solve it. If we didn't
want to be beaten at Chess by our own tools, we shouldn't have taught
them the game.
