0/30 = 0/31 :)

Lol - sorry, I was looking to work on one of my UI mods this morning,
rather than play*  Blizzard uses Lua (a lightweight scripting language -
http://lua.org) and XML to define the functionality and look of the 
interface.

They've given us the ability to use these to mod the UI ourselves.  In
order to prevent botting they've taken some steps - such as requiring
a hardware event (keypress or mouse press) to cast a spell, and only one
spell per event may be cast.  Additionally they disabled the Lua I/O
libraries (for obvious reasons) and the only way to write data out of
the game is through a function that registers variables to be saved to
a file called SavedVariables.lua when the UI exits (on game exit or UI
reload) -- there is no writing to outside files during gameplay.

Originally I thought this was all they'd done, but their implementation
of Lua also treats some basic Lua constructs differently - including the
distinction between this and self while doing OO in Lua.  A distinction
that seriously tripped me up, because I'd taken a utility class
developed in wxLua (lua 5.0) and brought it into the WoW evironment and
had a bazillion errors.  They also removed loadstring() - a lua function
that runs the string passed to it through the lua compiler and returns a
function that you can call.  Something that put a serious crimp in my 
plans to make a very useful utility class.

*  (there's a reason I'm only 14th level, I've spent more time coding
than playing :-P.  The advantage is that I built up a maximum
rest bonus (1.5 levels of double xp from mob kills.  It took me 3 levels
to use it all because exactly half my exp in there came from quests)) 

BTW - a disclaimer is in order on those mods - the code is UGGGGG - LIE!
The reason is that I was just experimenting, learning how to do stuff
when I told people what I was working on.  They were interested, I 
released it -- and I haven't had time to go back and re-write it with an
eye toward clarity now that I know the how of it.  The reason being that
feature creep has reared it's ugly head in FlexBar, and I keep on
finding new things to do with it rather than take the time to go back
and re-write ugly but functional code.  I've informed folks that I'm
taking a break from new features in FlexBar until the end of the
holidays - this will give me a chance to bring some of the utility stuff
I've been working on seperately into the code and clean it up
tremendously.
