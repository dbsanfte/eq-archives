funny thing I have had Velious up and going for quite a while and I
always play in full screen mode and everytime I would go into my
Inventory it would switch to the  smaller screen/resolution mode.  Now
the funny part all of a sudden last week when I go into my inventory
now it is the transparent window, I have had Luclin since it released,
and it didn't start doin it until two weeks after luclin...lol  Go
figure.
