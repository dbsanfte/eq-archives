Kind of like the Runed Mythril Branding Forge  that I have that apparently used
to drop off of some Shadow men or other and was used for a piece of quest
armor.  Consequently, the hammer is kind of rare because A> It was a quest
item, and B> It was lore and no longer drops.

Not exactly a great weapon, but it got me through levels 7-28 till I got my
Journeymans walking stick just fine. Not to mention, it has a neat little 5
point DD flame attack after level 25.
