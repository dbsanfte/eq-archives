Story time!

Way back in my 40's, when Howling Stones was a place we wanted to visit some
day, I led many folks to get to the vampire.  I'd follow the exact same path
you did, Zymyool.  Fight until you get to the long winding ramp; ITU until
you get to the bottom; single-pull the mobs (I was using the "Calm" series
of spells back before it was fashionable); break the vampire room (tricky to
do without aggroing the pit); camp until everyone had fangs.  I also knew
the way out of the zone, even after getting told several times that there
was no way to zone out other than to gate.

Once I wanted to lead two friends of mine down there.  We zoned into
Kaesora.  I said to them, "Okay, we jump down to the left here."  The pally
said, "Follow me!" and ran straight ahead.  Down he fell, right into the
nest of spiders.  We watched his health begin to plummet.  I told the ranger
in the group, "We should really let him die."  Not out of malice, but in the
acknowledgement that if we jumped after him, we'd die too.  Her conscience
wouldn't allow it; she jumped after him.  Resignedly I lemminged after her.
We all three died.

Now that was an interesting corpse run.  I'd had the "foresight" to bind
everyone outside Kaesora, so none of us were near a town.  I could summon a
hammer (this was way before the nifty proccing hammers; this was just a
simple lousy hammer on par with fine steel weapons) and buff everyone.  So,
very, very carefully we fought all the way down to the spider room.  The
ranger died once, ran back to us since the way was clear from the zone-in,
and accidentally looted her naked corpse (I was too low on mana to rez).
Then, when we got our corpses, she forgot I hadn't rezzed her clothed corpse
and completely looted it again.  So she ate two full XP deaths, which left
her terribly frustrated.

The pally was all kinds of apologetic.  He was really a nice guy who I
enjoyed hanging with, but this one time his impetuous act cost dearly.  Now,
a few months later, it's kinda funny.  Cleric who's been in the zone before:
"Okay, turn left and begin fighting our way down."  Pally who is new to the
zone:  "Follow me, I know a shortcuAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!"  Ranger:  "Following
paladAAAAAHHHHHH!!!!"  Cleric:  "Ah heck.  AAAAAHHHHHH!!!!"

All this is my way of saying:  no, lev and ITU won't do no good since undead
and spiders populate the bottom of the pit.  And the pit is a pain to break
since you drop right into the middle of everything.  It's best to go the
slow way you've already been going - you can control your pulls until you
get to the undead, then ITU to the bottom.
