Annie, thank you again for your response to my earlier post.  It did have
some valid points.

As for my masquerading as another poster here, I have been in a move the
last couple of days, and I've not had access to the internet.  I have only
posted to this newsgroup under the nym "Lonely Guy", and that's the last
I'll speak of this name-changing matter.
