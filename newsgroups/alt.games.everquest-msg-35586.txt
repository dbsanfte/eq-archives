And no one has answered my questions.

All:
    Please give definitive answers if you reply.  Seriously, "it don't work"
and "I was afk and a bunch got killed" serve no purpose to direct questions.

    Now please, read below and if you have witnessed the following
first-hand, then answer thusly.  (The main one being, you "conned" one
Velious-specific mob type, your group KILLED that mob type several times,
you conned the same mob type later and  you DID or DID NOT notice a
difference).
