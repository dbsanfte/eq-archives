Could someone please show an *uber* piece of EQ gear that a solo / casual /
small group kinda person can acquire?  Even kinda uber?  *NOT* something you
buy in the bazaar.
The coldain prayer shawl thing is pretty cool, but those last quests *do*
require a *semi-raid* if I recall correctly.
I lost respect for epic weapons when the first froglok made 65 with epic in
what.. .4 days???  Mr. Frog worked really hard for that one!  (And of course,
most epics require several groups to acquire).
Newbie quest gear?  Well you can certainly solo *that*.  But it's hardly what I
call uber.  It's *nice*, yes, but by the time you complete it you could have
sold pelts in the bazaar and have ***much*** better armor class for your time
and trouble.
Back in the old days my ranger DID solo a 1 HS weapon quest.  It would have
been nice, but by the time she completed it she already had better, (and she
was a newb, totally untwinked).  (Well, actually, I did have help from a
*single* friend on that one but just for the 1st kill and he was a newb and
untwinked too.  I kept it in the bank as an emergency weapon until she died for
the second time on a corpse run and let it rot...  I don't even remember what
it's name was.)
Is there a *single* quest that a *single untwinked* player or group could do,
that would end him up with a piece of *kinda uber* gear?  I'm hoping people
understand what the kinda thing I'm asking about.  I am rambling now...
