Oh I know full well the difference in Mages and the repeated upgrades they
have received over time now.

I have also grouped with certain mages (I group with more mages than wizards
in my guild).  In my usual PoP exp zones I know how long a mob will last
(avg) to my group..  what impact a charmed pet would have, a ranger, a
rogue, a mage, and so on.. (time per kill)

Using the DS to add to mages DPS is iffy.. how many mages solo
HoH/CoD/PoTact?  None?
Well I sure as hell have never seen 1 solo.  Those mobs would rip their pet
apart.

Also, pets can NOT KEEP AGRO PERIOD from a player char in melee range of the
mob.  A pet can solo a mob from 100%-3%.. if i hit it just ONCE I have full
agro.  So the mage pet doesn't tank assuming there is a melee in the group
(not an unlikely assumption in PoP, imo)

So you DS the tank..  oh but you can't parse DS damage.. so do you stand in
melee range of the mob, with all hits on, and see how many times he hits the
tank, to work out DS DPS?

No..  people just pull figures out their ass :)

The pet weapons are nice (tho most mages I know were already using yaks for
the proc for a long time pre-this), the new nukes etc are nice, the new
charm is (situationaly) insane, but unless your talking charm (which I don't
think anybody was), then talk of mages being number 1, so clearly ahead,
just makes me chuckle.  Sorry.
