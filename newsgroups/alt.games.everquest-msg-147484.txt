Oh that's priceless. You post an anal whine about Verant not
conforming to your world view of 'obsess over 9/11 constantly' and
declare you're quitting. I post what amounts to a "wow what a loss".
And from THAT you assume I don't care about what happened a year ago.
And it's not like I'm the only one. ANYONE who has disagreed with you
you have accused of not caring about what happened. Do you understand
why everyone thinks you're a jackass yet?

You're an idiot and a fool and I think you came trying to make
trouble. Everything after that has been gravy as you made a fool out
of yourself and everyone who made you what you are today. Your
officers and superiors in the military would be so proud.

And NOW you accuse me of doing what you yourself did. That's a
mastercard moment if there ever was one.

Tell me, honestly. Did you drink heavily the tenth/eleventh? I wager
you did. It would explain a lot.


>Explain to me how I'm a "Fuggin' disgrace to humanity",give me a valid
>logical reason how you came to that conclusion.

You accuse anyone who believes differently than you - that there is no
need for Verant to make a big deal out of 9/11 - of not caring of what
happened. That level of ignorance is simply inexcusable. I blame
Darwin; obviously he's been slacking in your case.

It's enough to tell a troll.

Mr. troll's (that's you) first posts had profanities every second
word. Here's a free clue for you: look up 'hypocrite' in a dictionary.
While you're there, look at your own thread subject line, dipshit.

Regardless, profanity has nothing to with maturity.

Troll, troll, troll. Seen it, bought the teeshirt, don't give a shit.


> Bah. I haven't really played in 5 months, now stupid
>penalties because I can't play the way I want to.

So you found an excuse to troll about how Verant is the evil empire
that should be destroyed. Oooh, how original, we've never seen THAT
ploy before!


>But still I'll be waiting for your response on how I'm a "fuggin'
>disgrace to humanity", since you don't know me it should be good.

I know enough about you from your retarded posts to know all I need
to.

The difference - he isn't. You are.


> He does get a little power hungry here every now

How would you know? Your post history is exactly one thread: this one.


>and then and he really goes off on people that make fun of his name.
>But I would never call him a waste, I don't know him.
>But go ahead and explain yourself and your deducting.

Duly done. You've lost, troll. You've been caught. Time to vanish like
the many others who thought they could rock the boat. You are out of
your league.
