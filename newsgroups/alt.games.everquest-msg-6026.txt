Greetings,

I have recently started a Shaman, and I had a few questions.

1. At what level does a Shaman really start to shine? I have played EQ
for a while, and after researching the Shaman spell circles it doesn't
look all that great until level 24. Example Level 1 DD
7mana/5damage....Level 5 DD 15mana/13-14mana) The lower level DOTs do
not seem overly impressive either.

2. What are the class advantages of the Shaman? I have played a Druid
at higher levels (40+). The extreme versatility of the Druid is always
amazing to me. (Damage Shields, Teleports, Regen, DOTs, DD). Are
Shaman more group firendly? (Stat buffs are not really as important as
they appear when you crunch the numbers. ie-any stat over 75 is
generally enough.)

3. At what level (if any) are Shaman able to solo? 

4. What strategies best suit the Shaman class?

I am having a blast with my new Barb Shaman. From a RP standpoint I
can really identify with the character. Last night she hit level 9,
and now with SoW she feels like a true Shaman.

Thank you for your time.

Cheers
