I'm taking a tangent here, but I have seen what I swear to be 9 hour corpse
runs on Antonica.  A guy -- maybe level 10 or 12 -- is standing by the gates
of West Freeport demanding SOW for a corpse run in West Commons.  I come and
go over the course of hours, and he always seems to be there, yelling
instead of playing.  Maybe he's not *still* there, but there again.  Still,
it does seem to an outside observer like the guy's on a 9 hour corpse run.

I still remember when I was new, and thought to myself, "what is this
wonderful spell 'SOW for a corpse run' and will my wizzie ever get it?"  Now
I've heard the chant so many times, I'm glad I never did get it.  Especially
since it seems half of those folks are lying.  I swear if I were a druid,
I'd always cast Scale of Wolf for corpse runs.  If the guy's really in need,
you've helped him all the more.  On the other hand, if he's lying so he can
kite or whatever, he'll really need "SOW for a corpse run" soon enough.

Oh well.  Not bitching, just rambling.
