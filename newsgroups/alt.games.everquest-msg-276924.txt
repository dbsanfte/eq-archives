I am fairly certain that CA law lists specific places in your home
that an intruder is allowed to be killed without recrimination.
Obvious spot is the bedroom but there was some bruhaha about illegal
aliens breaking into houses to steal food because they were hungry
(supposedly the language was very specific to avoid "starving"). That
being the case they did not pose a lethal threat to the occupants. So
the kitchen was not a killable location.

Like I said, fairly certain but not absolutely positive.
