Actually, it beat a Celeron 2.0, not any AMD processors at that speed.  The 
fastest AMD processor it beat was an Athlon "C" 1400MHz.  The Athlon XP 
1400 beat the P-III.  A lot will also depend on what specifically you want 
to use the system for, as well as what chipset you use, type and amount of 
ram, etc.
