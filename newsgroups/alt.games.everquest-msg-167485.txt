If your turn off ooc and shout, it can be tolerable there.  I mostly grouped
with friends there, so I did not have to deal with grouping with idiots.
When I did do pickups, I wasted no time at all leaving a bad group.  I
usually offered some lame excuse.

Recently, I decided to maky my push to 58, and found that pickup groups in
PoP seem to be a lot better, or perhaps I just got lucky.  Regardless, I got
in 4 excellent groups out of 4 pickup groups I joined.  Had fun, and did get
58.
