Well being a Half Elf, your wisdom is your top priority as a druid.  If you
didn't put all your points into Wisdom it might bea good idea to restart.
With a 40 Shaman there are some decent  things the 2 of you can camp.  Head
off to Beholder's Maze (Gorge of King Grobb)  and camp Evil Eyes.  They
rarely drop Polished Bone Braceletts which add 3 wisdom each.  You could
also head out to Guk with him and camp the Ancient Crocodile, who rarely
drops Gatorscale Leggings whcih add 4 more wisdom.  Your friend could also
get a pair of Split Paw gloves from Paw which add 2 more wisdom.  If you 2
have a few hours to kill, you can do the Testament of Vanear quest, which
results in a book with 10 wisdom and 10 mana.  That's all I can think of off
the top of my head.
