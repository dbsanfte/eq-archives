For classes, probably either mid-to-upper teens, at least.
In some cases - necro vs conjurer, for example - that
will need to be mid-to-upper 20's.   EVERY priest (druid,
shaman, cleric) plays the same until 10, after all.  Then
you start getting some flavor for the class itself.  The
ultimate class (fury/warden for druids) don't start until
20.   So you might know you dislike playing a druid
around 15 -- but you couldn't know you dislike playing
an offensive-oriented druid (fury) until after 20.  Same
for the other classes, of course.

Races are easier - you should know whether you like a
particular race shortly after reaching your home area and
certainly by level 10.   Other than the obvious -- short/tall,
good/evil, starting stats -- there's not a whole lot of game
differences between races.
