Here's some notes from my opening night journey to Stonebrunt on Test.
(my 41 druid and wife's 41 necro both went)

Zone entry is through the Warrens. Don't ask me where, I had never
been to Warrens before and just followed people.

Suggested level range is 15-40 per the GM's broadcast message.

It's a *big* zone. Mountainous of course; some jungle-looking areas,
some barren fields of rock reminiscent of Dagnor's Cauldron, though
not as jagged as the latter).

Warrens loot rules apply. Lots of bitching in /ooc about that.

The Kejekans, cat people a la Kerrans, live here and have a fort
near the middle of the zone. There are merchants here including
pottery, smithing, and baking vendors, and a few Kejekans give
out quests. There is a forge, pottery wheel, kiln, and oven here.

The Kejekans are enemies of the kobolds who also inhabit the zone.
They also hold Erudites and Heretics in contempt as you might expect.
Kejekans were apprehensive to my Halfling druid, KOS to dark elf necro.
Oh, they're KOS to wolf form too. (the old dogs & cats thing I guess)

Killing the kobolds did NOT raise the Kejakan faction (Peacekeepers?),
only ErudinHighGuard(?) and Heretics.

The southern part of the zone near the Warrens seemed to be the
lower level end, with very low mob density. I found quite a few
blue-to-level-41 mobs toward the middle and north side, where 
they weren't spread out quite as much.

Other than Kejakans and kobolds, there were tigers, leopards,
granitebacks (apes), adders, pandas (which use the same animation
and sounds as ulthorks...kinda funny), rabbits, and spirits 
(willowisps in various colors, quest-related).

The leopards and tigers are FAST and the leopards at least 
seem to have a wide aggro radius. Several people commented
that mobs seemed to have high HPs. I did not find this to
be the case.

A couple of mobs of note: Old Ghostback, a large ape shaman
who was blue to some 50+ players (I did not see this beast
myself) and Snowbeast, a large tiger who was blue to me 
but I didn't mess with him, partially because he seemed to
be on the Kejakan faction. He did not respond to hails.

Drops: nothing special that I found or saw announced. 
Lots of the usual cat pelts, Tiger Hides which are for
a quest, excellent and damaged gorilla hides. We got one
fine steel weapon which wasn't familiar, and Panda Claws
(crappy magic 1HS, 7/30 I think but quite lightweight).

Foraging turned up nothing but the usual junk. At least here I
didn't wonder where the hell the rabbit meat came from.
