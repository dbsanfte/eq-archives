This once again proves my axiom that once a thread hits level 3 ( 2 replies 
deep ), there is a superb chance that it has deteriorated to non-
information.

It's nice that some of the "old" people here actually do informational 
posts over 50% of the time, -vs- some of the others who only post 
information if it makes them look good if they answer the question

Many thanks to you who DO take the time to answer questions.
