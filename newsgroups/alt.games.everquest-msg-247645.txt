 Read the end. I said its wasn't recommended thng to do. BUT they
refused to talk, they came in and started killing in an closed small
area that somene was already killing. The big difference was I was
high level. Would your opinion be the same if I was low level and this
happened? Doubt it. The bitch I have is they came in and started
killing without een asking anything then ignore my messages. As for
pat on the back, I didn't post it for that shit. I posted to get a
feeling of whether this was right thing to do. Evidently the wrong
place to do so since a few of the 'outspoken' have decided to practice
their abusive skill on here.
