Heh!

A correct statement. Happens regularly. Med in Qeynos hills not BB.
Pets will die as you zone but you take your chances in BB.

Wrong!

Probably not, Probably farming faction. Everyone has to do that from
time to time. Happens in Crushbone a lot too!

Never attribute to malice, what you can safely attibute to stupidity.
Maybe the 50+ found they were tired of the pounding. They rode out on
thier horse.

No, you dont draw aggro when medding on a horse. Gnolls pass hate a
lot. I once got in trouble farming in Steamfont from very very green
Mino's.

It sounds like a case of envy. They got a horse and a title and I
didn't.
