Well I would first suggest listing all Servers (before joining one) by
population and go to the top of the list....these will be the most empty. Up
there you will find the Zek  servers (PvP rules) and FV (Role Playing Rules)
but there will be normal servers there as well. At the other end you will
see the likes of Karana and Bristlebane and the newest server, whatever the
hell it's called ;�)

Create a(or some) character(s) on one of these more empty ones and try them
out. Planes of Power is an expansion you might also want to check out, it
will make life easier (with travel and cash) although I'd make sure you
enjoy the game first before spending out anymore.

As mentioned above, check out http://eq.crgaming.com/ as someone has already
suggested, for some idea of what characters can do...I can't say I totally
agree with all they say about starting attributes and bonus points but other
than that the site is decent.

CHARACTER NAME;
Ok...here's my favourite topic.
This should be part of the character creation screen, imo but check this out
first
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_naming_policy.jsp
Remember you will get a surname (of your choice) at 20th level so don't go
calling your character "Zaxordeathbringer" just "Zaxor" will do, you add the
surname "Deathbringer" later.
You will often find that names are taken or not allowed, that's because
either they are popular, obscene or you have just tried to make a Wood Elf
Ranger called Legolas...You'll be lucky to find an alternative spelling to
Legolas now, they have all been taken. Besides, if you did some
cantankerous, name nazi will just /petition to get your name changed...like
me ;�)

I'd suggest giving Firiona Vie server a try if you'd rather play a more RP
orientated game...the people are pretty nice there but with no /ooc channel
to ask for help I'd get to know the game on another server first. FV is a
bit quiet so getting groups isn't as easy as on a normal server.

The Planes of Power expansion will make life easier in two ways.
One, travel. It will enable you to travel to any of the starting cities in a
matter of a few zones.
Two, Cash. It will give you access to the Bazaar, this is where characters
setup as traders and the best place make some money (by selling Trade skill
items like spiderling silks, spider silks, low/medium/high quality pelts)
assuming you are able to leave your PC connected for a while.

If you get lost anywhere then try www.eqatlas.com although hitting BackSpace
will give you a map of the zone if it is a starting zone. If you want to
know what an item of equipment is or info about a quest/mob try
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/.

Good Luck
