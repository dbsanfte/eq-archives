Well I haven't tailored for months, but when were the recipies for
Cured Silk changed? Last I knew it needed a pattern, some swatches and
some heady kiolas. In fact before other Wu's came out, I thought the
only recipe under 150ish skill was Wu's Fighting Gauntlets that
required Viscous Mana. Have they changed or not?
