At the risk of having someone waste alcohol trying this, the
booze isn't there as the source of heat, its there as an
accellerant to get the fire well started in the first place.
You are doing the roasting off burning fat.

Of course the booze won't function very well as an
accellerant for the reason you mention... which to
my mind is a good thing, discourages the waste of
good alcohol.
