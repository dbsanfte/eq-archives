Ah, that would only matter if you cared a great deal about foraging.  I automated

forage, not to get forages, but to get foraging skill up.  Automated I get almost

every forage cycle if I"m not in combat...skill skyrockets compared to my
old technique, which was to forage whenever I thought about it or while doing
bind wounds.

As a bard I'm continually slapping many many keys in short order.  Adding
in another set like this just to pick up a few extra "during combat" forages
certainly isn't in the cards.

I put my attack on =, which seems to be out of the way and not to conflict
with anything useful.  As you say, though, its a long held habit now, I'd be
hard pressed to move it no matter how logical someone's suggestion as
to an alternative might be.
