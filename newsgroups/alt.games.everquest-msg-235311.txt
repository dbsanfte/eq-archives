ummm, no offense, but you DESPERATELY need to upgrade your computer.
Everquest.exe is choking because it's laughing so hard.

These are the minimum specs from Luclin:

Required Specs:

  a.. Windows� 98/2000/ME/XP
  b.. Pentium� II 400Mhz or greater
  c.. 256 MB RAM
  d.. 16 MB Direct3D compliant video card and hardware T&L (i.e. Nvidia
GeForce/GeForce 2 or ATI Radeon)
  e.. DirectX 8.0 compatible sound card
  f.. 28.8 K+ Internet connection
  g.. 4X speed CD-ROM
  h.. 450 MB+ hard drive space

These are woefully inadequate though.
