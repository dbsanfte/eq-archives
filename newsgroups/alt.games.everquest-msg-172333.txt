I was in Highkeep today for an hour or so.  Finally dinged and wanted to go
to the bank to get my new spells.  Alas, she wasn't there.  Two people were
there waiting for her to spawn so they could kill her just for fun.  They
admitted they weren't getting any experience from her.  I asked them to stop
because I needed to use the bank and it made them even more anxious to kill
her the next go-round.  Every time someone went upstairs to use the bank,
they would immediately kill her so no one could use it.  Then they started
laughing and shouting, etc etc etc.  Immediately a huge discussion started
in the zone.  I said out of character that it was very inconsiderate to kill
the only banker in the zone, especially just to be mean.  I got mixed
replies.  A couple people said, "welcome to Everquest... people aren't
considerate here".  I tried to /petition but I was told by nearly everyone
in the zone that it's perfectly ok to kill bankers and venders if anyone
feels like it.  I know that people kill guards all the time, but there are
LOTS of guards.

Anyway, I just thought I'd see how you guys felt about this.  I love
Everquest, and don't want to think that "people aren't considerate of
others" in the game.  Everquest is supposed to be fun, and personally I
would never do anything intentional to make the game unpleasant for another
person.  Maybe I'm in the minority, I don't know.
