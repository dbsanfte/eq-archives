And the point i was trying to make was that this and this alone is what
forced the evolution of uber guilds. If you dont have enough people to kill
a mob you want to kill you get more people.Once guilds get to a large size
they no longer have to care about what other players think since they are
entirely self sufficient. Being entirely self sufficient ruins part of the
social aspect that was supposed to be in the game. If you build the mob the
group will come that will try and kill it :)

It is all the fault of the designer who got stomping mad when *his* dragon
was killed. Frankly I consider 100+ people guilds to be an abomination even
though I am a member of one ;)
