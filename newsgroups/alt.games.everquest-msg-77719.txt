I disagree... SK's arent really about damage output.. (IMO anyway)

Shaman and monk

Warrior and cleric

Cleric and mage can be nice too.. fire pet, cleric heals pet, mob burns its
self up and gets nuked by the mage.

My SK was leveled just soloing with a cleric for 95% of his levels, he does
fine.. I wouldn't say it was optimal though.

How about a necro and a rogue, fear kite and BS :)
