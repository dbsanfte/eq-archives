You keep quoting it, but never answering.

This is patently untrue.

I have seen so many stealth-nerfs and unexpected/undocumented changes in 
patches that I don't even know where to start.

I don't mean "the hall to the left vs the hall to the right", I mean the 
precise line inside that hall. There have been many places, historically, 
where running through one set of pixels has a very different effect on mob 
pathing. Talk this down all you want, I have fucking seen it, as have 
others.

Well, fine, I will concede this. I always asked my clerics how many cheals 
a set %

Really? Wouldn't it be nice if the chanter had enough mana to keep the adds 
locked in mez until the cleric gets back or the pally can heal the MT or 
the monk can bind wounds or....?

Virtue cast on, say, Furor represents a 15% increase in his total HP, not 
to mention the added mitigation of 75 AC. When you are timing a CHeal on a 
6k HP tank, having 25% of their hit points poof due to a dispell or 
whatever can be a disaster. At the point you duck out of CHeal and start 
spamming faster heals just to survive, which is much more mana intensive.
 
KEI dropping on a cleric represents a loss of 500+ mana - which is over a 
full CHeal as you know.

Sometimes it Just Don't Work. I have had mobs resist snare multiple times 
in a row, on multiple occasions.

I am speaking generally. You only confine your arguments to LDON when it 
suits your specific point.

I am not advocating a full tank- I am advocating keeping some in reserve 
for nasty contigencies.

Perhaps in your uber gear world this is true. There are other parts of the 
game where the rest of us live- You, like many other ubers, assume that 
that end of the game is the only end.

I know, as a moderately twinked cleric, I would not be pleased with three 
mobs on three different tanks when I was at 20m.

By the time a pet is within range to charge after something that has 
offended it's master, it is within /pet back off range.

No, I assumed that the Mage may have been the last man in, filling a spot 
or whatever in a group. He may have had a SOW dropped on him right before 
entering, or whatever. I never said Mages could SOW, indoors or out.

Keep 'em. Myself, I will do what it takes to ensure my party is safe- it's 
my job as a cleric.
