I'm sorry, but Magpie pointed out that he/she was tired of "being told 
how to feel" and used the feeble excuse for not mourning that "they were 
doing something they loved".  Clutch replied disagreeing, and you 
replied appearing to agree with Magpie's idea.  Seemed to me like you 
were saying the same thing s/he did - especially since you didn't snip 
out his/her message in your response.

Um - personally, if my dad loved flying, I'd rather have him at home, 
dying _PEACEFULLY_ (keyword) in bed where I can talk to him for the last 
time, than see his plane crash on the evening news.
