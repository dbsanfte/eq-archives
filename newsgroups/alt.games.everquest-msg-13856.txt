I take no offense in you thinking I am rude for taking the position I have
taken.

Actually, this was the most reasonable response I have heard so far from
either you or bizbee.  I don't argue with your or his name-calling.  Of
course, name-calling is not the highest form of  reasonable argument.  My
whole point in my post was that some people do take offense to uninvited
inspections and and some actually take some action in the game.  I haven't
heard a reasonable argument to dispute that.  If the most reasoned response
you can come up with is that you find me to be rude, disrespectful and petty
... well, I won't lose a wink of sleep over that.
