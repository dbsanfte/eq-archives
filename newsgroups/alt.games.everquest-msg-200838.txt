LoL!  Actually, I'm not really sweating it.  I just thought it was kinda 
humorous.  It isn't surprising, really, that it's so low.  I've *played* 
with the spells when I get 'em, but really haven't  had a use for them 
yet.  I've been grouping almost exclusivly (sp?) since level 6, and the 
first 6 levels was partly grouped.  {As an aside, a friend started a new 
char at the same time I did, and we've been haaving fun grouping and 
killing---that's why Miznit has been grouped since level 6---easy to 
group with someone when you know when they'll be on and where they will 
be fighting, AND their level. :) )

Haven't gotten brave enough to look at my offensive skills, however.
