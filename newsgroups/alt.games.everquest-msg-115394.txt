Ah, but Lesser Succor has the group mana drain component that Egress
doesn't, so using LS over Egress ends up being not 50, but *350* mana more,
also, Egress is 5 second cast time, LS is more than double that at 10.5
seconds, and I know there's been situations solo where that extra 5 seconds
(or even an extra 1 second) was the difference between a quick escape and a
nasty CR.
