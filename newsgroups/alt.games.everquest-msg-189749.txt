It was light or dark blue (don't recall now) on the one that gave me
experience.  I recently dinged 14, but I had still played long enough at 14
to know that every Wandering Greenblood (BB) was still giving decent
experience.  That was part of my criteria for continuing to hunt there.
After returning from the Bazaar, wearing all my spiff new duds, the first
two Wandering Greenbloods returned no experience.  The third did.  The point
is, I had never killed a Wandering Greenblood before and not gotten
experience.  I did not play all that long, and I will do a more thorough
study in my next session.

BTW:  Giant Scarab beetles con light blue and they still return experience,
though only a small amount.

Cheers,
Eric
