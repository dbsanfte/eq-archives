Fight the whole time with a 1hs in the primary and a fast 1h blunt in
the secondary.  When 1h blunt gets decent, put it in the primary hand
and put a piercer in the secondary.  You can get wepon skills from the
secondary hand.  In fact, a warrior using a wurmslayer in the primary
and no weapon or shield in the secondary not only has a better wepon
than some 2h slashers, he will gain skill in hand-to-hand.
