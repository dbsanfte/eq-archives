Bah, reread my post and then for extra credit try the rest of the
thread.  I was testing whether displayed AC had any direct effect
on combat, apparently it does not.

Oh and your assertion needs a bit of a qualifier... what difference in
levels are you comparing to what difference in gear?.  A L40 warrior in
typical gear is far more powerful than a naked L41 warrior.  On the
other hand there is no gear in the game that would make a L1 warrior
even noticeable alongside a naked warlord.
