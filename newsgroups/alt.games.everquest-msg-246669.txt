I can't make reference to GoD zones or raids since I never purchased
that expansion, but prior to the DX9 series of patches, the only zone I
had any lag in was the bazaar and that was minimal. Now I have god awful
lag in most zones, lockups in PoK etc. The lockups in PoK have only
occurred since the most recent patch (Thursday?), My card is the Asus
9980 FX5950 Ultra with 256MB.
