Given that you have in place a method for scaling dungeons to
balance for anything from 4 level 20s to 6 level 65s at "normal"
or "hard" settings, whats stopping you from putting in place an
"easy" setting for all but the lowest extreme, and for that
matter an "insane" setting for all but the highest extreme?

Say for the "easy" setting for 6 level 20s you subtract 2 of the
level 20s and give them the mission the 4 20s would have gotten.
For the 6 65s, give em the mission for 4 65s.  Simple enough to
do for every group except the ones which have no member over 20
and less than 6 people.

For the "insane" setting, just ramp up the difficulty as if
everyone were one or two levels higher and had the "hard" setting
on.  Up until you have full groups of 64 or 65, this should again
be just a simple matter of adjusting the apparant average and
generating dungeons you already know how to generate.

If you are too lazy to generate the few new cases, just grey out
"easy" when the group average drops down too low for your "4 20
normal" dungeons, and grey out "insane" when the group average
soars above the "6 65 hard" dungeon difficulty.  Or figure out
how to subtract a few from the bottom end, add a lot to the top
end, to fill out the new extremes.
