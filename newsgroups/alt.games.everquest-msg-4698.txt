1:  It's entirely possible.  Online discussion has been around longer
than most readers of this group have been alive.

2:  There are a great many people who have been involved in online
discussion that long, and even longer.

3:  There's no compelling reason for him to lie about this.  What,
he's trying to impress a bunch of emotionally retarded trolls?  C'mon,
like they'd give a shit about how long a person has been online.  The
few things they can get their apathetic, pathetic, and ignorant little
minds excited about are Dragonball Z reruns, newsgroup trolling, and
the rare occastions in which a member of the opposite sex will choose
to make eye contact with them.
