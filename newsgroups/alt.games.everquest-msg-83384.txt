That's not his claim, and you know it.  You can't run
away from this one. Rape is a common event, and even
the most misogynistic fundamentalist has to adress
it (though, oddly, the mystic does not).  

However, your argument is not a mystical one, so
pulling that tactic out of your hat won't really
fly (and is easily answerable in mystical terms).
Avoiding the hard issues is not the way to show 
how superior your view is.  Are you avoiding the issue,
or are you claiming the bitches were asking for it?
