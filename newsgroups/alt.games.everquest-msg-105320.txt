Wow, that's a serious leap..."website & game acting weird...I wonder if it's
hacked."

You've GOT to be new to the game and the internet in general.  EQ has never
(3+ years) been hacked in that way.  In fact, as far as I know there are
only 3 "cheat" programs out.  None of them are of interest to the vast
majority of players; only one is of ANY use, and last I knew you had to know
Linux to use it, and NONE of them harm the servers (hardware/software) at
all.

The internet acts weird all the time.

There's nothing at all wrong being being a newbie, so if you took offense at
this post my sincere advice would be to stick it.
