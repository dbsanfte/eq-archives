The Grey, just about anything.  Interesting at first while you get used to
the skelly AI and learn how to avoid the traps, but after a little while it
gets a tad repetitive, especially when you have to dodge trains.

Maiden's eye, probably just about anything that isn't red to you, but the
zone is a death trap, keep FD or gate (to out of zone) up.  Definitely
interesting, but pay attention, death can be fast if you get trained or pull
too many things that HT.
