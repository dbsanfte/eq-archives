Use alt-O to open the options window.
Select the "Keyboard" tab.
In the menu, select "Targets".

There are two new items in the list on the left, one for
cycling through PCs and one for cycling through NPCs.
Neither of them will have a key assigned to them yet.
Assign keys the same way as for any of the other features,
which, in case you've never done it, involves clicking on
the row of hyphens listed in the middle or rightmost
columns, and then typing the key or key-combination (e.g.,
control-F7) you want to use.

Note: If the key you type shows up in red in the options
window, it means that key is already being used for
something else.  That's not always a problem (e.g., TAB
is used for switching between yourself and last target,
and is also used for cycling through people who've sent
you /tells when you do a "r" to reply to one of them,
and the two uses don't get in each other's way), but
usually it means you want to choose a different key.
