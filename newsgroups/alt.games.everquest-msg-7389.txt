LOL, I remember Biz three years ago in the UO newsgroups always squawking
about his killfile.  To be honest, this little love spat between him and
avenger is entertaining as hell.
They're both arrogant, self-centered, and stubborn enough to keep this up
for months. Two peas in a pod.  Hell, I look forward to coming home after
work just so I can get a good laugh at these two going at it.
Let 'em go, its like watching that trailer park trash on the springer show,
except I can read these two any time of day.
