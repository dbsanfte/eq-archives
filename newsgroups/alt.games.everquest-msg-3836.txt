You will want to learn ALL of it. At some point in your career, you will
run across fantastic weapons for your level that are 1HS, 2HS, piercing,
1HB, and 2HB. The best weapon in the game is hotly debated, but there
are several weapons that are the best weapon for you now at your level
that you can afford or quest for yourself. The epic weapon for Warriors
is a pair of 1HS swords that can combine to make a 2HS sword. But that's
not attainable for many many levels.

My warrior has fine steel longsword (1HS), a bronze mace (1HB), a nice
two-handed sword, and a fine steel dagger (piercing). When she gets dual
weild, she can use her sheild of the slain unicorn (a very nice piercing
weapon). Meanwhile, she's practicing all of these skills, and needs to.

STR is the primary- it affects how much damage you do. Agility affects
your armor class. Stamina affects your hitpoints. These last two define
how long you can take damage and how much. Dexterity comes in to play
when you get a weapon that "procs"- it has a special effect that
proceeds to go off- the higher the dex, the more likely it goes off. 

Keep in mind, that there is equipment in game that builds these stats,
as well as hit points and AC.

Depending on your race, slam is good. This is available only to large
races- trolls, ogres and barbarians. Slam is like Bash without the
shield, and will be used by large races throughout their careers. I am a
wood-elf warrior, so I do not get that luxury. I use bash when I can,
but I worry more about kick.

Kick and bash cannot be done at the same time. Kick you can do at first
level. It's an extra attack you can get into a round.

Taunt is important in group situations when you have casters. Nukes and
heals get the monster's attention. Most casters cannot defend themselves
any where near as effectively as you. To get the monster hating you
more, and back on you, you must Taunt. You should practice taunt while
soloing, so that you may use it when grouped.
