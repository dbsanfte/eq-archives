All AC items work like that.  The final AC number is derived from
raw AC (your equipment) and your defensive skills.

No way the JBoM added 269 ATK!  I think your comparing apples to
oranges here.  What you probably noticed us the difference between
your hand-to-hand skill (no weapon equipped) and your 1h slashing
skill.  Try it again with another 1h sword equipped.  Pick up the
JB from your inventory and drop in into the primary hand slot
replacing the other blade which will now be on your cursor.
ATK should be exactly the same since the type of sword is not
considered when calculating ATK.  The only way ATK would be raised
is by equipping a sword that added strength, but 269 points would
be way off the scale!  ;-)
