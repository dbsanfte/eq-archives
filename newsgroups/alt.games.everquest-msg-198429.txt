A friend and I were thinking about how to safely pull a dragon
so as not to commit suicide in the process, and we got to
wondering what's the absolute longest-range "pull" you can do
in EQ?  In other words, which spell/weapon/whatever allows 
<insert classname here> to stand the very farthest possible
from the mob and then cause it to aggro?
