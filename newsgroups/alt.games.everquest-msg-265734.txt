It's a game and if they get board enough hearing complaints of this nature
you will probably see it change, but then again after five years of EQ1
there is still unresolved issues so don't hold your breath.

Play it safe, be a Ranger, when you purposely do somthing to get someone you
don't like killed or die they all understand cause your a Ranger doing what
they do best, so really you get to be both good and bad, hehe

I have my moody days when I want to be good and others when I want to be bad
so I create characters for play depending on the type of day it is for me,
if your lucky you'll catch me on a good day, but your probably better off
just not catching up with me at all, have fun, cya.
