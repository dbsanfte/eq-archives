Must have been some kind of history between the two or something. 
Seriously, that would go well beyond stupid otherwise. Could be they 
forgot they had /shout turned off.

Sounds like the difference between them and you is that you finally gave 
in and decided to get a group started, which appears to have gone a long 
way toward solving the problem. Do you have some aversion to being the 
group leader? If not, then maybe you should just go into it each time 
planning to start a group. It seems to work for you.

I agree to some extent though. Forming LDoN groups is quite tiresome 
sometimes. I find it's usually due to a *lack* of possible players, not 
any kind of general stupidity. Don't get me wrong. The stupid people are 
usually there in force. They just normally manage to get into an 
adventure with me before showing it. :P

Better luck.
