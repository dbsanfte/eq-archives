I agree that it could use some post-60 dungeons, but the mid-to-high
content would be welcome as well.
Yes, a large percentage of players are high 50's+. That is not reason to
ignore all the rest of the player base. Luclin put in some nice 20's
zones, and some nice 35+ zones that were desperately needed. A few more
would be great. A couple of playable (not raid required) 60+ zones would
be great too.
