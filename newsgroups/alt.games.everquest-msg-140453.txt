Actually, our Vox raid leader who would bring precision 24-person
raids down to take her out regularly used the strategy of letting her
CHeal, since it meant 10 seconds in which she didn't melee in which to
do 10,500 points of damage to her. (CHeal only heals 10,500 points of
damage, regardless of how many hit points a MOb has to start with.)
