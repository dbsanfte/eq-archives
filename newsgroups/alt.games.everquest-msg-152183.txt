U-God* said:

Given your spelling of 'you', it is quite flattering of you to tell us all 
we are God, but I feel obliged to deny this hubris.

}U misunderstood me.

Given your clear mastery of English, and your obvious smart*s, how could 
that have come about?  We must have tried awfully hard.

}I dont expect not to pay to run my car or read my books.

You pay to read your books?  Do you pay by the word, or per volume?  Or is 
it a monthly reading fee?

}And i pay my internet fee already (u noticed?)

Very good.  You can therefore post pointless messages to any of thousands 
of Usenet newsgroups.  This does not, however, grant you access to 
privately run servers, such as the ones Sony hosts Everquest on.

}And considering i did most of
}the mozzila browser design work i consider myself... smart*

Oh dear.  I didn't realize Al Gore was Portugese.
