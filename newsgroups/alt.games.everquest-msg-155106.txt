So here's a thought; have a friend make a level one alt with
correct faction, group with him, and have him hand in the goods.
He won't be getting any exp, since he's outside your level range
(assuming you are over level 6) but you should... and since the
exp split is based on level, he'll be taking the very smallest
slice possible.  Sadly, you won't be getting any faction hits...
or perhaps not sadly if you didn't want them in the first place.
