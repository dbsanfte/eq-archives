Well, moot for you, maybe.  But your story seems unlikely.
 
 (1) You report conned faction change.  This suggests that you never saw a 
     line saying "Your faction with Priests of Life has gotten worse".  
     Without such a line, I've never yet encountered a situation that 
     wasn't explained by something -other- than an actual faction change.
 (2) Did you also check your log, between the two connings, for 'your 
     illusion fades' or the ever-insidious 'you appear'?  Or worse, could 
     you have been 'invisible' the whole time?  I came across a recent bug 
     where, if you're invisible and hand something to an NPC (like, say, 
     to complete a quest) the invis icon stays up, and it never -says- you 
     appear, but the NPC you're handing it to no longer (necessarily) cons 
     indiff.  And then you walk away, thinking you're still invis, and 
     something ugly that shouldn't have seen invis kills you.  Joy!

Anyway, I guess my point is, change in con does not a change in faction 
make.  Nor vice versa, for that matter, obviously.  It's been a long time 
since I've done it, but I'd really be suprised if you got a negative 
faction hit for having too low of faction, when no other quest in all of 
Norrath and the planes does that.  So go have a look for me, would you?  
Was there a faction message?

For me, I'll go create a level 1 hummie and hand in a fish.  But gonna 
have to wait til they fix my DSL.  Bother.
