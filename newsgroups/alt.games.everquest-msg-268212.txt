Well, I called it a skill becasue they called it a skill in the patch message,
but it doesn't seem to be a real one.  It does not show up in the skill list,
nor does it increase.   As far as I can tell, all the change did was to remove
the gathering skill increases from collecting items.    Although it is
possible that the gathering classification was causing problems.   Tier 2
requires 50 gathering skill, and tier 3 needs 90 as a minimum to gather from
plants.   Perhaps that requirement was being applied to collectables as well,
such that only crafters had the skill to get them.   If that was a problem,
this might be to fix that.

Ah, as in my sig, I'm playing mostly on Guk, although I still have one
character that I haven't moved off Mistmoore yet.

I had been making mostly tailor items, so those damn tubers were killing me.
They're not any harder to find than any other component... but in tailoring,
you just go through them like mad.   Adding up all the subcomponent costs of
making burlap gloves for my caster friend...  Burlap cloth, Generic burlap
pattern, burlap padding... thats 5 tubers for thread and yarn + 7 chemicals
(made out of tubers) +1 wood.    Plus replacements if the cloth doesn't come
out pristine.
