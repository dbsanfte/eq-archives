I started a dark elf necro in phase 3 of the beta. It was my first
character. I had no idea what the hell was going on. I had no idea how
the hell to get around. By level 4 or 5 I knew Neriak like the back of
my ass and could give other people directions, with no maps. I had to
do things like find the necro trainer area myself, no one else knew
(and that is pretty hard to find actually.. past some scary ghouls, go
figure)

You learn by doing and you don't need maps. I have gotten so very used
to knowing where I am in EQ now that I don't even need maps for areas
like Luclin which are brand new. Very likely the area of my brain
which controls spacial relationship memory (or whatever) is by now
finally tuned. I have one map that I use in EQ now. Its simply a
luclin zone connection map, it does not even have locs. I run around
the entire world constantly. Its just not that hard.

Really the best way to get around in any area in luclin is, unles you
are a dwarf since you start at 50, to use your initial few level
points to train sense heading and also make a sense heading button.
This is the best way to remember where you are.
