Yep, the 'challenger' is laughing. (Especially since, after all this
time picking at his uberness, he didn't know I played the same class)
If he's trying to piss me off, he failed miserably... It would take
something like fucking up my kromrif military leggings quest (like a
moronic bard who couldn't even lie convincingly about it did last
night) to accomplish *that*.

I'm frighteningly efficient as a Shadow Knight when I am furious - I
needed to kill something last night, and her partner and I damn near
dinged. The dark side of the force is strong with that one, I guess :)
