Ah, this old chestnut.  Seem to hear it everyday in the bazaar.

The problem with EQ is that there are many inflationary forces but
just about no deflationary ones.

Anyone can start a level 1 toon and sell things at extreme prices and
"get away with it".  How many people would do that with their main
characters where they actually care about there reputation?  "Hey
there's ole <insert name> don't let him in the group he's a greedy
gouger" ... wouldn't that be nice 8)
