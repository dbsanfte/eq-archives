New race: Bizbee (plant)
Class : Plant Assmaster
LVL : Youre stuck at 12 years old.
Special ability: Charm animal ( wich includes: Lokari, Dark tyger etc..)

Can be found in forest and sometimes in desert-like regions althought they die
quickly there cause they need water to feed their brain. Not much of a threat,
they die fast after a couple of bad words trown in their direction wich make
them so furious, their head explode and make some nice fireworks.

Heres a trick to make your friends laugh at your next party. Go get some bizbees
and put them in a bag...the more you get the better it is. Nail them on the
walls but make sure theyre not dead before everyones there. When everyone is
drunk, trow a couple of bad words to those bizbees. Lol its sooo funny....bloody
fireworks everywhere. Youre in for a good laugh : )
