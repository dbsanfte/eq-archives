Ahh, didn't know about the Finland connection. I thought you were in SoCal?

Hmm, if you're talking about online references, I'm afraid most of the ones
that I use are fee-based and pretty heavily laden with legalese and not very
user-friendly. If you mean actual physical books, I would recommend any law
library (if you live in SoCal, you should be able to access the local County
Law Library).

But really, you could probably find most of the information you need on
negligence principles from any good book on Tort Law, probably even in the
business section of your library or bookstore. You may have heard political
candidates talk about Tort Reform -- what they're talking about is reforming
the rules that apply to "torts". Torts are civil wrongs other than
contracts. "Civil" in this case means "not criminal" and the exception for
contract cases is based on centuries of distinction between the handling of
contractual disputes vs. other types of disputes. So, basically, any time
you do something wrong to someone (hit them with a car, cause hot coffee to
spill in their laps, accidentally shoot them, libel or defame them,
whatever), other than breaking a contract, that's a tort. It's based
primarily on negligence, because the idea is that if you do something with
the deliberate intention of hurting someone, that's just flat-out criminal
behavior. But the law recognizes that accidents happen, and that accident
victims shouldn't have to have sole responsibililty for the consequences. If
you caused an accident to happen, and it was based on your negligence, you
should have some responsibility and the victim ought to have recourse. And
thus the laws of negligence were born to handle torts.
