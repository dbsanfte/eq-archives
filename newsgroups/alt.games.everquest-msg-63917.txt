Make sure you bring a good group. That guys' a bit of a bear. My old
guild took him some time back. He death touches (or more likely just a
huge harm touch, I forget) the first person to attack. Very nasty. Some
AOE's as I recall and a fair pile of HP. Clearing the terror hall and
doing it with the correct timing so you can turn in the item and still
make it back down to the fight without
a) getting there after he despawns
or 
b) dragging a train from hell of terrors with you
can be a bit dicey on the timing. Hard quest for a single group unless
you're well organized.
