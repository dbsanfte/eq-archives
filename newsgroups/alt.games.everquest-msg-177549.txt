There are 3 to consider and depending what you want from the game they
will add different things

Velious - the whole new UI thing from velious is now really pointless.
Other than that it gives a bunch of new zones and some serious faction
based quests and armour from lvl 35 plus....I guess of all expansions it
is the area I like the most to play in - but for a new person expansion
picking frankly it has the least to offer these days. Not sure if it still
is the expansion  that allows you to get to lvl 60 or not or if Luclin
does as well.

Luclin - Zones from 1-60, new race, moderately reasonable rapid transit
system. The bazaar, the nexus and a whole host of bits like this makes
this the expansion I would suggest you buy myself unless you are a high
level player in a big way...

PoP - The fastest rapid transit system, the world is now the bivalve
mollusc of your choice and distance means diddly. However the content 
is for High high and more high level play.

Ykesha will give content for 35-50, a new race and some zones - but really
its too early to put it in the mix.
