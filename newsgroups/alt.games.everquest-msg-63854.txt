Mages fall asleep on rare drops from rare spaws, or on ones deep inside a
water dungeon with respawn times of 11 hours (and again the rare drop from
that mob).

Plus.. have you ever been to Air? And how about the 7th island? And how
about a rare drop from there?
Right, makes our Quillmane camp seem like a breeze.


What's the point of long boring camps anyway?
I've been camping SolA for the Power of Fire, a (very) rare drop from a few
elem's on a 20 minute or so timer.

It's not a hard camp in any way, but I seriously dislike the point that you
sit on your butt for hours on end without any real reason except the drop.
My current count is at least 28 hours now on those bloody elementals and
I've read through 1 book in the mean time and halfway a second.
