Hm... if I had a GM hand me my dream equipment, no question:

Full Golden Efreeti armor from PoA (minus the helm. Yuk)
Sarnak Battle Shield
Bone-handled Scimitar (already taken care of)

That Talisman of Val Kerrath thingie ;)
Vulak stuff in the rest of the non-visible spots

A white ornate chain-bridled horse
