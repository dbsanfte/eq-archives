I Love my ES arms.  Capital "L" Love.  It distrubes me the feelings I
have for this particular piece of equipment.  

I'd still rather have the pet though.  :-)

Levitation?  Bah, I go SoE.  Everlasting breath would be kinda nice,
but I got Enduring Breath.  It's not that hard to keep a stack of fish
scales AND batwings.

Remove Greater Curse might be handy for some high end content

gonna be a big deal for me.

Moonfire.  I'd get Moonfire.  :-)
