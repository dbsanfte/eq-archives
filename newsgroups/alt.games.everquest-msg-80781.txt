    Fire debuff. Circles. PotG - which, if you don't have a Group Aego
capable cleric, is the path to max. HPs on your tanks. Druids are an
important part of a raid. They may have stacking issues, as they're mostly
responsible for buffs and one debuff, but you can't say that having a druid
is a bad thing.

    Also meaning that all players need to be optimized for these encounters.
Which means best possible buffs. Which means having that druid around.

    If all you think about is damage output, you'll never be happy with your
class - only one or two classes will ever be at the top of that totem pole,
and here's a hint: it'll always be the classes without utility spells. But
saying that buffs like Call of the Predator and Brell's Mountainous Barrier
(RNG and PAL) aren't very useful seems rather shortsighted.
