7 days of offline time, 1 day of online time, both interacting with each
other pro rata. Time online in the chat server and in other servers

Well the idea is you dont go charging round areas you dont know very
well....or at least you are aware of what you risk....

Bind something to the command /loc and make sure if you are close to dying
you hit the key and get a knowledge of where the corpse is...

In your case you need to get to the docks, sit on the boat till you get on
the right leg (out from Freeport) stop at sister island (as it is called
and go to your corpse - well within the timeframe you need....
