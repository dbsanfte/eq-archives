And how many people were there the FIRST time your guild did it?  What level
were you?  If you were at least 55, go away, you don't know what gimp means.

We killed him on Friday night.  We'd done it a dozen times before.  Average
level was low 50s but main group had:
60 warrior (epic)
60 warrior (epic)
60 rogue (epic)
60 cleric (epic, though not relevant)
59 cleric (me)
54 druid - person we were doing it for

They wanted to jump in and "just kill the thing" before everyone else showed
up.  They really think they could, and they were guests from arguably our
best raid guild.  But no, it wouldn't have worked.  When Fay was at 40
health the MA got less than a bubble of health and almost died before CH.
When he was at 30 I died.  Throughout the rest of the fight other healers
had to keep the my other cleric alive.

Two groups, for our very experienced crew, was enough.  We ended up having
4, and that was serious overkill, but politics is involved...the person we
were doing it for is well-liked and I'd never hear the end of it if they
weren't "there for her."

But the thing is...we're VERY experienced doing him.  The person who started
the thread is a newbie.  The first time our non-uber guild it took 50.
Second time we barely made it at 30 people after being wiped after trying
24.  With a MA of a level 56 and enough meleers you're GOING to need a
minimum of 3 experienced groups.  Most people don't have that.

It's relevant in that you called an extremely difficult critter for low-50s
a "gimp" because you're a badass level 60.   It's relevant because people
like you, at level 40, are the same people who laughed at a group of level
20s trying to take DVinn because he's a "gimp."

Hell, you're the same type of people to call Gore a "gimp" because YOUR
guild killed her with 3 groups and lame_assed_guild04 had to use 6.

And yeah, I know, my grammar blows in this post but I don't care enough to
fix it.
