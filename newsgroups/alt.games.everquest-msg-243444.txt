I'm looking at trying to get an eroded leather bracelet to turn in for
some grand masters wrist wraps (summon pouch of quellious) and I've
had a look at Allakhazam to find where they drop.

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=25602

This shows a long list of named giants from level 33+ that can drop
these items.

The question I have is whether the named giants only spawn in places
like the castle and the keep or do they spawn somewhere accessible
without a strong raiding force ...particularly somewhere a level 59
monk could sneak in and beat on a few giants and run !
