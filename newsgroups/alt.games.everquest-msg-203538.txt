#1 has caused massive whining by some mages on the Tower.  Interestingly
enough it's only the elemental ones.  They claim, among other things,
that the lack of raid content is going to be a huge deterrent to players
of all levels, not just elemental.  But, they aren't being backed up
by those players.  

Taking my guild as an example, during the day there's a constant stream
of "Getting a group together to do xxxxxxx."  A few times a week there's
a scheduled raid, but there is PLENTY of raid content out there that we
haven't reached yet (NToV is still challenging for our level/numbers)

These people actually claim that a focus on 1 group encounters will hurt
their guild (Triton on their web page).

Everyone I've talked to about the potential to put a dungeon group together
and crawl a dungeon is excited by the prospect.  And because the generated
dungeon is going to be generated according to the player levels, all our
people (ranging from low-50's to 65 and 150ish aa) will be able to
participate.
