The game is and always has been what YOU make it. Yes, it's still
levelling and such. There are quests scattered throughout. But, if you
want more than that, you are going to have to put in some effort. You
want roleplay, find a guild/group of friends that roleplays. There's
only so much that can be done in a game like EQ from the developers'
side. If all you do is group/kill/level/die/corpse run, that's because
that's all you choose to put forth the effort to do.

As for changes over the past couple years... Hybrid xp penalty
removal, respawning with items under level 10, hell levels "taken care
of" (the speed bumps were smoothed, but total xp to 50 remained the
same), soulbinders (NPCs that will bind you, located in all starting
cities plus Firiona Vie, Iceclad, and Overthere), Luclin's nexus
system provides for free teleports to any of the continents between
the wizard spires. There is more.
