I'm sure that this part has already been answered.
You can "ping pong" between two players.
This is done using the fact that I can always train you to one level
higher than I am.

So I have skill 1 in Language X
I train you, you get 2 increases to level 2
You must now zone. (To reset your counter ??)
Now you have a skill of 2 and can train me to 3
Then I zone, come back and train you to 4

Rinse repeat, 4e4.

HTH,

Jim
