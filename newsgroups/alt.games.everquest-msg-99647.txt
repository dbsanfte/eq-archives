"Rebalancing" doesn't seem to be much of an issue. Each expansion
brings in much better gear and, to some degree, trivializes some
encounters in the previous expansions. How much easier, for example,
is Vox if your main tank is in full Skyshrine gear and wielding some
uberweapon from Ssra Temple?

I'd love to see level caps raised to 70 and a few 60+ XP zones in PoP.
It might make more room for us lowly 55+s in older zones.
