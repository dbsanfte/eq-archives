That last line almost makes me thing you are trying a parody of /gu
comics...

Assuming that's not humor, "monks... need less heals over all" is so
laughable it should be.  I'm the guy 2-boxing the cleric, enchanters and
wizards take less damage tanking than the average monk.  :P

I don't agree with his list by any means, but I don't agree with a lot of
what you said either.  :)
