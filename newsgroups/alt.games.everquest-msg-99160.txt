no no no.  He turned and ran to get distance to snare them.  he's a 57 ranger,
and was at 3.5 bubs health when he turned.  so he turned, ran a bit to turn and
snare. AT that point, Fergul was pulled from my friend.  It's like someone
pulling your mob when you're kiting them.  Also, why is it that they ONLY pulled
Fergul and not the added giant and wolf.  MALICE!  the added wolf and giant
conned GREEN to my friend!  They weren't the problem, he just wanted to have
them all snared.  I have a 44 druid, and I was the first one that Fergul aggroed
on cuz I ensnared him.  Unfortunately, I died and respawned by the spires in GD
where I bound myself before I started the quest.  MALICE, MALICE, MALICE!
