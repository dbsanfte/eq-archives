Well, you'll end up buying time cards eventually with what money you can scrape together
after losing your job to the EverQuest addiction.


... Seriously, though, I saw one guy post where he was wondering how he could keep
his account.  His credit card had been cancelled because he lost his job and could no longer make
payments.  He said that he had about $10 a month to spend, though, and wanted to
keep playing EQ.  This was maybe 8 months ago on this newsgroup.  Posting is
probably still on google somewhere.  THAT was truly pathetic.
