Not much you can do. The early levels are like that. I always avoid the 
critters that poison, though they're great for working your bind would 
skill - provided you're already up to 10 or so. :P

As for the stuns, you just have to grin and bear it. It does get better 
though. I don't know what level you get your special attacks, but you 
might try timing your kicks to land right before the mob swings. I was 
thinking your kicks have a stun component. Can someone correct me if I'm 
wrong there?
