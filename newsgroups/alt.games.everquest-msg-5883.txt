There's no type of broadband available here as of yet ... still 56K.
Usually, I'm able to connect at 49.9K, and the only time I experience any
lag issues is when there are more than 2400 people or so on my server.  As
the night wears on and the east coast folks start to drop off, lag stops
being a problem.

Hope this helps! :-)
