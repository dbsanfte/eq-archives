You need to give the stats (damage and delay of your current weapons)
before we can talk about what's "better".

Just sell them.

Ally
Warmly
Kindly
Amiably
Indifferently
Apprehensively
Dubiously         - merchants will not sell to you with this con
Threateningly     - will attack on sight (smaller agro range?)
Scowls            - will attack on sight

I had to turn in about 100 fangs IIRC. I think she is SteelWarriors.

Don't kill barbarian NPCs of course, but otherwise there are no worries.

In game, the only way is to con them and repeatedly talk with them until
they give you the quest.

As long as it's not NO DROP.

Turn them in for Halas faction instead and sell the armor, or sell to a
high level player looking for faction.
