	That's what it was in The Original Series.  Once Roddenberry was taken out
of the picture, TNG started to change that, and DS9 and VGR totally threw it
away.  Roddenberry wanted to show that we'd overcome problems that seem
insurmountable, even if he had no idea how we'd do it.  The folks who
inherited The Franchise decided "no, humans really do suck" and gave us the
20th century with lasers.
