    Stop right there. When you're sitting staring at a patch of ground, it's
not like you don't notice who is there. =)

    That is one concern. But if they aren't getting someone to cover for
them, they aren't getting in on Ragefire. SOMEONE has to be there watching,
either the cleric or a proxy for the cleric. When some of my guildmates did
it, even overnight we had someone from the guild there at all times. Because
that's what it takes.

    Actually, it's the first. If you read our server board, not once was the
overt threat of sanctions ever brought up. It was simply pointed out that
all the guilds that you'd think most likely to ignore this and go FFA were,
in fact, participating in the system. Mentioning that calms people that
worry they'll invest time in a system that can be busted at any point, and
also serves notice to guilds thinking about breaking the system that they'll
have to race the big boys if they pee in the pool on this. I can see, given
your server history, why you'd distrust the way I put things the first time.

    Shhh - I won't tell if you won't tell! As an aside - that's another
reason in a long list of reasons why I won't do the camp. Nobody logs on my
character but me. Period. End. Of. Debate.

    Stop. He left the camp? Lost his spot. People sit in for you when you
log, not so you can go do something else.

    See above. Also, when you count the people covering for you, you'll see
that once a cleric joins the system, SOMEONE is there 24 hours a day. So
nobody is putting in more time towards killing Ragefire than anyone else,
unless someone is bringing more than one person to the camp.

    Yep, this is the risk anyone who invests in the system takes. So far,
we're doing fine - the jerks are deterred by the presence of the big guilds
and the sheer number of mid-range guilds as well.

    We were the first FCFS guild on the server, very shortly followed by
what was the top guild at the time (and which is now the guild we race for
bragging rights). The previous rotation system was very corrupt - guild
alliances were basically booking mobs as the individual guilds, thus
securing several shots at a target. We didn't take as much heat as that top
guild did, because we've always been open and friendly. We're the ones that
broker solutions to conflicts. We're the ones CotH'ing a stunned warrior
from HoT to loot a Runed Fang Necklace. Maturity really pays off long-term.

    I wondered how many were from your guild when I saw it was on Prexus! =)
It's too bad that, in some way, a nerf WILL result from this. I can't think
of twelve other people that could take down Sontalak now that he procs that
AoE.

    Ayup. When you take the time to build something nice, you defend it.
Hasn't happened yet, with our server culture it just might not happen - but
I'm prepared to do it if it becomes necessary.
