Nah. Bards are easy to play. Do do a bard well does take some skill
and patience, and consideration of what your doing... but bards are
simply too easy to solo to call them the hardest class.

Enchanters are certainly a challenging class. Lots of options and
tactics, lots of aggro opportunities, targeting challenges...  and no
hitpoints :) This would get my vote.

That doesn't make them hard to play. But your right  you do have to be
able to perform a little triage from time to time, without hesitation.

Exactly.
