Mezzes are fragile and you can't hurt the mob while keeping them
mezzed.  Slows, once stuck reduces the mobs damage by a fixed
percentage regardless of whether you're beating the piss out of them
or not.

Charm has it's own problems.  Namely the unpredictable duration.
Slows are on fixed duration.  Remember, in this game it's all about
maintaining control over the mob's AI.  And minimizing the
uncontrollable parts.

Except they have to constantly twist songs.
Think of it this way:  Shamans are the only class to get slow, haste
*AND* healing.  This is why they were the god class.  Bastards also
got a decent pet...

No he's not.
He's understanding that damage mitigation and damage healed goes hand
in hand.

If a spell I cast heals 500hps vs a spell someone else casts that
keeps you from *TAKING* 1000hps, who is the better "healer"?
