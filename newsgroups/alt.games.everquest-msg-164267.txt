It depends on the situaiton, when your crawling through the trash it's
doubtful you're going to need more than 2 or 3 prepared *and* you are
probably going to want a Ranger to step up and add tank (you probably
won't understand why a Ranger but I'll leave it to you to work out) or
at least a Paladin or SK.

But even conceeding that, in XP groups it is WRONG when a second warrior
has more utility than the first monk.  That's broken.  Even your deluded
self should see that.
