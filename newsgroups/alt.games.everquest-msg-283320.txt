They  have reimbursed *some*.  The ones who had to change their credit 
card number because it expired or was stolen, are out of luck according 
to their latest message.  Nothing like screwing your loyal customers. 

See they gave no way for people to change their credit card number, and 
the *only* way to change it was by cancelling your account.  This is a 
scam all in itself.  And illegal.
