That doesn't make you a bad enchanter, it just makes you not a great 
enchanter.

It doesn't even do that, really, it makes you not a DPS enchanter. 
Since few groups understand the potential of that, and even if they do 
understand it, know that most enchanters aren't going to be good at it, 
you won't likely be invited to groups to do that job.  Enchanters are 
measured by their ability to control crowds, and you can be fantastic at 
that without ever resorting to the dangers of charm.

But, if you -can- master charm, you'll be more flexible, and since as 
you've noted there's less and less call for a standard enchanter 
(paladin lull pull + shaman slow if slow is even called for = no CC no 
slower) you can create a new niche for yourself.

I'm not an expert at enchanter charm duty by any means, but here's what 
I've seen:  mez mob, get it ensnared and malosied and tash it yourself, 
then charm it.  Now its resistances are low for when it checks for charm 
break, and if it does break relatively soon, also low for recapture. 
The ensnare means it lumbers about when it breaks charm giving you 
plenty of time for the recapture effort.  Commit to keeping it as your 
pet; haste it, feed it some treats (ok that last is just for fun). 
Unlike your animation, this pet will listen to standard commands.  His 
DPS is also probably double that of your animation, and his HP probably 
quadruple that of your animation.  When charm breaks, if its relatively 
early, stun him and recharm him, stun will wear off very soon 
thereafter, send him right back in to the battle.  This means you need 
to keep your distance from him at all times; use guard here whenever you 
aren't on the move, so you can go to the other side of the room.  If its 
been a long time since the last charm break, use mez instead, giving you 
time to retash and get ensnare and malosi reapplied.

Ensnare isn't necessary if you don't have a druid/ranger in the group. 
Other snares are too short lived to bother with.  Plus in an LDoN style 
run, where you are constantly on the move, it can be crippling.  Its 
just much safer for you if you can arrange it... and consider it 
"training wheels" while you are first learning.

Malosi isn't necessary either, really, in fact I'm not sure it helps at 
all; what resist do charm, stun, and mez check against, does malosi 
reduce that resist?  At any rate, you may not have a shaman or mage in 
your group to do it for you; again its just helpful at best.  You have 
Tash yourself, after all, and you can pick your target; don't charm the 
high level high resistance mobs, go after lower level mobs that are 
easier to tag and keep tagged.  With experience in a given zone you'll 
find which mobs suit you best: ones that don't resist much, do good 
damage, and don't move extremely fast.

With a charmed pet in a group which doesn't need you as CC you can 
really concentrate on keeping the pet on a leash and being major DPS. 
If the group does need you as CC, you'll have to be careful, because at 
any moment your pet can become one more member of the crowd of mobs... 
and he's the one you need to control first because he's hasted and hates 
you with the fury of a white hot sun; charm wipes his memory of anything 
anyone else did to him.  You may wish to forgo haste in this sort of 
situation, thowing away some DPS for your own safety, particulary if you 
aren't keeping him ensnared.

You can even be the MA for small groups; your pet probably has more HP 
than any tank in the game, and outdamages them as well.  Pet taunt 
sucks, though, so some care has to be exercised, and pet taunt is 
useless if any PC is in melee range of the mob, so you need an all 
caster (or archery ranger) group to take advantage of the charmed MA.

And you can solo this way too, although now you'll be lacking snares, 
and healing, and "get it off me" talent.

Problem with either MA or solo charm is that now when charm breaks, you 
don't just have the former pet out for your blood, but also whatever he 
was fighting.

All of this may sound more daunting than it is, though.  Fact of the 
matter is, any good enchanter should be used to seeing multiple mobs 
suddenly gunning for his throat, and should already have high speed CC 
like PB stuns loaded up ready to roll at a moment's notice.  Charm 
breaks are just a matter of an angry mob or three coming at you that 
-you- need to do something about.  SoW, Shrew, JBoots, Run 3... 
something that can buy you distance if you need it, plus a focussed 
attention (until dire charm you can never ever relax with a charmed pet 
about) and you've got the principle tools of the trade.

Oh, and charisma gear, but you already have that like it or not as an 
enchanter, and you already like it as a luller.

Splendid One, 52 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
Llyric, 57 bard with lots of charm experience, Morell-Thule
Matte, 30 enchanter with some chanter specific charm experience, 
Morell-Thule

ps: I don't think of this as highly qualified to describe the job, 
because like many spells, charm sucks at lower levels for an enchanter, 
short on duration on light on "stickiness", plus your tash line spells 
at lower levels don't lower resists as much.  This means that your pets 
break sooner and more often, which trains you to think that they aren't 
functional as a plan.
