Well, I tested it, of course. :-)

Are you talking about total regeneration, or regeneration above and
beyond your natural regeneration?

Also the spdat.eff suggests troll illusion regens 1hp/tic, and iksar
zilcho.  (castersrealm gets their spell info from the spdat.eff)

Another acid test is that skin like nature won't stack with troll
illusion because of the regen component, but will stack with iksar.

spdat.eff again.  It adds 3 and 6 respectively to a mystery attribute
that is also affected by an AOE curse the Thought Horror Overfiend
casts, which causes 9 in 10 spells to fizzle.  Casting IS on everyone
at that raid helps a bit.

Also, you can find a wizard with low conjuration skill and watch them
fizzle away a whole bar of mana trying to summon a familiar.  Cast IS
on them and watch them fizzle once or twice before casting
successfully.


Was confirmed by the "spell guy" in the link someone else mailed you.
Although I too take everything Verant says with a grain of salt;
in-game evidence seems to be on their side on this one.
