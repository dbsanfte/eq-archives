Aye, especially in an aoe group when you get spammed with 15 mezz breaks 
at once. :) But usually, the instinct seems to be to blame it on any handy 
melees that might be present, rather than visiting lucy or something.

The one that really got me, though, was being on a hedge run with two 
other enchanters once, and discovering that -neither- of them understood 
the not-so-subtle difference between boggle and everything else in the mem 
blur line...  "Why's Thelin still beating up the bard? I blurred him 3 
times!"
