Shaman would have hated me. Stun, back off, stun, back off, stun, back off.

Assuming I couldn't stick mez. Frankly, I tried PoI at 47 (the day PoP 
came out) and decided it would be great to come back to in a few levels 
when I could stick spells.

I've booted a few in my time. the ones that stand out:
Ninja looting idiot monk, who proceeded to get his account suspended for 
a week by feign training us.
Guy who was harrassing the women in party chat (really bad). They asked, 
I punted. We didn't need a mage that bad.
Bard leading a group once told me to 'Give clarity, give haste, tash, 
and sit on your ass. If I see you nuke, charm or mez you are outta 
here.' So I bailed before the first pull. Entire rest of group quit, I 
invited em all. Not quite the same thing, but close.
There was the druid I recall because it got me an interesting 
conversation the next week. Dude was getting people killed, dotting my 
mezzies, using ae spells. I did my 'me or him speech'. Groupleader, who 
was in his guild, said he couldn't kick him, part of the guild rules 
(really, it was. I looked later), but begged me to stay, as they 
couldn't continue without haste, slow, and mezzing. Two other guildies 
there too. I told him make me leader and I'd punt his buddy. He did. I did.
Their guildleader contacted me (actually contacted MY guildleader, who 
told him if he wanted to talk about Tyas, talk to Tyas about Tyas) like 
a week later. The conversation is not worth repeating.

My first boot in Final Fantasy was a couple of weeks ago...
	In FFXI we were doing pool loot... stuff goes into a pool when you kill 
something, then people can roll on it or pass. If 2 people in the party 
roll on something, it's which of those two are higher. If noone rolls, 
it randomly gives it to anyone who has space in about 90 seconds.

So, S.O.P. (for us lazy people anyway) is only roll on 'special' things 
that would be annoying to lose because you died or went LD. let 
everything else drop out randomly, so you don't have to keep going 
through the loot list and roll on things. We had a guy that couldn't 
handle that concept. He kept rolling on everything... which forces 
everyone to roll. (meaning when I'm in the middle of pulling..)

That wasn't what got him booted. He was a character with subjobs, (Black 
Mage/Monk O_o) which means he has completed one of the two subjob 
enabling quests. You can only do them once. I also have my subjob (was 
working on leveling my subjob in fact, as apparently was he, as you have 
to be higher level than he was in order to obtain a subjob. I might also 
mention he was a Galka, not the best race for a BLM...). There was one 
other in the party with a subjob, and the other two were working on the 
quest. We get one of the (nodrop) subjob quest items to drop. I pass. 
Our Ninja/Warrior passes. The two single job players roll. Black mage 
rolls, beating both of them. For something he has absolutly no use for!
<punt>

(The other loot method is called I think 'Quartermaster'. One (leader 
designated) person gets to go through the list of looted items and 
assign them to whom they go. Never used it though.)
