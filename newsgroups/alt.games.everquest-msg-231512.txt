A little of both.

I think it is paramount that 2 boxers be upfront with the status of the 
characters, and advise which is the 'primary box'. So I agree 
wholeheartedly you should be told when one of your groupmates is a 'bot.

On the otherhand, some bots like Wizards and Makes can contribute enough 
to a raid to make it worth them being there, even bot clerics, or 
necro... can be useful...suppose the raid is wiping so the bot necro 
FDs, and is ready to rez...

Often its better to have them there not doing much, than not having them 
there at all.

One contentious issue in dkp guilds is how/ how much to award bots for 
their contribution... but that's just nit-picking.

But at any rate... you should be told about it. As a cleric, and on a 
raid, for the most part you should be advised to nearly ignore the bots 
and not waste any effort on them that might risk the 'real players'.
