More like 17ish years ago on those shiny little thingies with music on them,
I still own my original Teac CD player I bought in 85, and it still works.

To continue with your analogy though.

Remember those shiny LP thingies, same size as an LP, but look like a CD?
Most people don't, they never caught on real big.  I own a couple hundred or
so Laserdiscs, which were far superior in all respects to Videotape, except
that you could not record on them.  Remember SuperVHS?  That was a new
version of VHS tapes that came close to laserdisc quality.  I still have a
few tapes kicking around, but again, despite being superior in all respects
to VHS, it never really caught on, and you could record on them.  Remember
Betamax?  How about DAT?

Most likely in the case of DVD, it will replace CDR and CDRW over time, if
they ever standardize on one format, and something better doesn't come along
before that happens.  Certainly DVD has caught on as the new media for
video, although, I still don't own a DVD player, one of these days I need to
break down and get one.
