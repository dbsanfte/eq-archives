Taken from the Paladin Class Issues thread in the EQLive forums:

"6. Two handed weapons (including Epics) NEW
 
Two handed weapons are too far behind equivalent level one handers and 
shields in terms of stats.  Everyone agrees that there should be a stat 
penalty to going two-handed, due to the DPS improvement, but the difference 
is currently too great.  Remember that not only do we lose out in terms of 
the regular stats being lower on a two hander than on a one hander plus 
shield, we also lose the potential of a second set of focus effects and a 
second augment (a very big deal given the quality of augments available 
these days).  There was some suggestion at the Summit of giving two handers 
a second augment slot, for example, to narrow the gap somewhat - can this 
be implemented?"

Are these the same people who were complaining a year or two ago that they 
didn't have a good reason to go with a 1H and shield? Is it that, even 
given better stat/focus/aug options (how much better?) on a shield and 1H, 
they still don't want to give up any DPS to get it? I would think they 
would expect to give up a some DPS to get the advantages of a shield.

This just struck me as curious. Someone feel free to enlighten me.
