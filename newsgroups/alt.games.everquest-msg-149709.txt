Rogues are fine.  They are like anti-druids...difficult to solo, highly
sought for
raids.  The only thing rogues need is for poison making to be a bit easier
on
the pocketbook, and for the damn things to stack (10 dose blood of the wolf,
why not 10 dose Visionistic Pain?).  If poisons worked to the point that
they
were worth the money (spend 11 pp on a mob that drops 3 pp?), then more
rogues would work the skill up and soloing definately opens as an option.

Frankly, I believe rogues/monks/warriors don't have to worry about new
skills and spells because their time is spent in that period upgrading their
equipment...because for all 3 classes, equipment makes or breaks them.
