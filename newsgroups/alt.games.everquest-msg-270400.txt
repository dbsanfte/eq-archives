Ah, but you see, in EQ, you -require- the loot, coins, equipment, and xp 
in order to go anywhere else. So even if you do want to choose the 'long 
way', your are still nearly forced to spend a large chunk of your time 
doing the stuff you don't enjoy in order to fund or afford you little 
indulgence.

Now if the stuff you didn't enjoy was a compelling aspect of the game, 
I'd go along with 'games are about choices', and 'theres something for 
everyone' sort of arguments.

But lets face it there is *nothing* satisfying about time spent in OT, 
PC, BoT, and other PL camps *except the xp*. The players there are bored 
to tears, and only do it to get loot faster. If they took the xp from 
those camps away players would stop doing them. Nobody is there for its 
own sake. If they redistributed the xp to other more engaging content, 
the game would be better for it.

NOBODY enjoys the 'grinding'. People aren't choosing to grind because 
they like sitting in easy camps trying to stay awake. They *do* however 
like the rate at which their xp bars move. HOWEVER If their XP bar moved 
just as fast while doing something that engaged their attention and 
required skill the game would be better for it.

There is no reason that maximizing your xp gain should minimize the 
amount of skill, and egagement in the game.
