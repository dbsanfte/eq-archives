Hi All

According to the patch...

"Ranger, Beastlord, and Paladin heals have been upgraded. See the
spell descriptions in game for details"

Anyone able to tell me exactly how the Beastlord heals have been
upgraded - from the spell description they look like they always did,
and no new ones have appeared.  

Have I missed something?

TIA

Palindrome
