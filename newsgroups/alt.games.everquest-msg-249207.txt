I would, take the Rivervale stone from PoK, run through Rivervale. Wait
for daytime and run round the north edge of Kithkor Forest to Highhold
Pass. Then dash through the maze of High Hold Pass, to Highhold Keep.

BTW, you'll probably need invis around Highhold Pass entrance, unless
there's someone keeping the Orc's in check there.
