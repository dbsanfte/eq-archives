> 	What exactly did they do to charm?

From skimming the threads mentioned, I gather they've added
some sort of cap on the damage done by charmed pets.  I don't
know the details, but I saw things about mobs that quad for
2k suddenly doing only 180 or 300 or something when charmed.
(But if charm breaks they go back to 2k.  I saw one suggestion
that there be a delay before the damage goes back to normal.)

There were other gripes, but that's the one about charm that
I recall.

As for the person who said this was part of pushing chanters
back to a group support role, I don't see anything wrong with
that.  But though I don't play a chanter, I did sympathise
with the one who was over in some OoW zone and got asked for
KEI, and he said there were 5 enchanters LFG, why not ask one
of them to join their group? and they didn't want to spend the
slot on a chanter.  (He suggested they port back to PoK for
their KEI then. :-)
