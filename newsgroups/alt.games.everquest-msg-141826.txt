In case you didn't have to deal with it, the faction on one (or more) of
the mobs involved in the wizard epic was fooked up for a long time.
(Basically, when you finished the epic, you became KOS to all the mobs
on that faction.)  Absor went so far as to come post on graffes in a
thread entitled "We're Looking Into It".

Well, last patch it was announced it was fixed.. Maybe it is. I don't
know, since I'm not done with mine. In fact I just started it last
night. Errr.. tried to start it.

The same mob who ends the epic now stops you dead in your tracks when
you're nearly done with the "running around" part of it, after you've
blown over 2K PP on bullshit to get that far, and starts insulting you
like your faction sucks. (Even though he was just cheerfully doing
business with you in the previous steps.) 

Two grand later, an entire evening wasted, a chat with a guide who'd
never even heard of Truespirit Faction, and a two hour wait for a GM who
never showed, I am.......

Exactly where I started, only much lighter in the pocket.

So, anyway, until this is straightened out, if you're thinking of
starting the wizzy epic this week, hold off until we get word that it's
fixed YET AGAIN.

head every 15 minutes. Over all, it's certainly less painful, and very
probably more productive."
