I recently got Cloak of Truth (for the AC and stats) and noticed
it also has a +5% meditation on it.

What does this really mean?

My meditation is 252 currently, and I imagine the cap on
it is (like every other skill, I think?) 255.

Does 5% really mean 5 points?  If so that would put me
at 257.  Does it mean 5%?  That would be 12.6 skill points
or 264.  Can we go over cap skill?  Or is it 255 either way
really, and as I level up a little more will it become
completely (as opposed to almost entirely) meaningless?

Further, do these items stack, or is just the best +med item
counted?  I know (from another thread here) of a 4%
med bonus range slot item, thats 9% if they stack.    Get a bunch
of these and double meditation skill... thats really something.

The same question applies to the other skill boost items, what
does (for example) a +5% tailoring item do?  If at 200 skill this
boosts you up to effective 210 skill, thats the equivalent of
hours of work and thousands of pp spent.  Even if it only
takes you up 5 points, thats still a couple pp worth of drop only
goods worth of work and time.  Another question,
say you have a 200 skill and a 210 apparant skill, and are
working on an item that trivials at 204 skill.  Is the item now
trivial, and therefore no skill advance?
