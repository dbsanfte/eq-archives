I'd say first try a different dial up number, the only common thing with all
systems (surely the software loaded and anything else done since isn't
EXACTLY the same on all).  If not that, get someone to test with a different
ISP, or get someone with different hardware setup to test on the same ISP
AND dialup number.
    If you try changing something (hardware or connection) then that would
help determine which of the two the problem is.
    Also I'm not 100% sure, but I'd also wonder if its the fact that this is
an ISA modem we're talking about here too.  Has anybody tried a PCI modem as
a test or connect to EQ on another ISA modem (changing either the dialup
number, ISP, or just the brand of modem)?
    Also one final test...
1) Log into EQ.
2) Get yourself to a part in the game where you start to notice your speed
drop.
3) ALT+TAB out of EQ (note: Be sure you're in a safe place to CTRL+ALT+DEL
to close EQ because you won't be able to get back in to play....make sure
its SAFE or have someone guard you....by the city guards, sitting down is
safe, or within a city).
4) Use your web browser you normally use (don't change anything, that's
important, need to make sure the fact that EQ is also running is the ONLY
difference).
5) Try your speed, but also remember that you're constantly sending data
back and forth to the EQ server.
6) Really all of this shouldn't matter much, if your connection speed to EQ
(or even to your ISP) was TRULY slower, then you'd notice more lag on the
lag meter.  Has that part changed?  Maybe its just that something else on
the system is not working as well now that DX8 is being used.  That's really
the only difference now that I know of, considering the Luclin part hasn't
been patched in yet.
