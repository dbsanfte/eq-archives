   Dunno about necros, but I know that clerics can.  I created a woodelf 
help my friend transfer some items. After it was done, I challenged her
to a duel (level 1 vrs level 16 or so).  After torturing me for a while
(whack me till I'm almost dead, then throw a light healing on me), she
feared me.  In Kelethin.  
   Did you know that if you get feared in Kelethin, you won't run off 
the platforms?  I ran up to the edge, then ran along it till I got
to a ramp.  I made it five platforms away before the spell ran out.
