Well, maybe you can go see movies about amusement parks. LOL

No seriously, I can point out a few things but it won't make either of
you less fat of a couple ...might actually get worse.

She likes shopping ..show her Ebay. But this can result in
many,many,many stupid buys that she would never have thought of
buying.

Amusement parks and Zoo's...Show her RollerCoaster Tycoon or Zoo
Tycoon.Nothing like building your own park, fun games and not that bad
of a time sink. But if you don't have 2 PC's could result in fights as
to who gets on next.
