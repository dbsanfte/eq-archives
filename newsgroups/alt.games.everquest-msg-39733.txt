And the stuff that drops off the low-level mobs in Stonebrunt can be killed by
level 6 players? How do they get there alive? It is so stupid to say that
low-level players are being denigned stuff in Stonebrunt if we define low-level
as being level 6 or level 9. The would not be able to get there, and you fucking
know it. Stop being stupid and start making some sense.

What an intelegent comeback. Where did you find this one at? They teach in you
the play ground who to say this one? The guy said that low-levels are defined as
level 6. What level 6 player is going to be in fucking Stonebrunt? If you would
do you homework instead of learning this trash on the play ground, you may be
able to actually use your brain for something other then to occupy the space
between you ears.
