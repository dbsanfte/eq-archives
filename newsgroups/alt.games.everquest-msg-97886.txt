I can't imagine this was caused by people complaining more like they looked
at DAoC and thought it was a good idea to have an easy run at the beginning,
difference is DAoC still has death penalties just no corpse runs (ever)

The spell book was obviously due to player complaints, in the roleplaying
sense I agree with it as it was, it goes at a certain level but I do also
see the point to removing it. Playing certain characters, especially
Clerics, up until 35 was 80% staring at the pages of a Spell book.

They've now made corpse summoning easier to obtain, think I'd prefer them to
have made corpses not disolve but get moved to a kind of lost & found zone
after 1 week to be restored by a GM or Guide when requested. I do know
people that have lost all from hardware failures there end (one was their
line, DSL, the other the Hard Drive but she had no money to replace until
end of the month) and I doubt any one that plays in areas that make
difficult CR's would really want to opt for a 1 week wait to play again with
full equipment.
Saying this, can you not petition to get your corpse from a dangerous spot
(under Naggy's claw, on Hate or Fear etc) so maybe the Summon Corpse change
was to save on petitions for GM's/Guides to do it.

Eliminating Death penalties completely? LOL,  I'd still be 52 by Summer :ï¿½)
