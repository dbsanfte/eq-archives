Hello People,

I've been mostly lurking here since I got EQ back in October of last year 
and have found this newsgroup to be full of good information, not to 
mention good entertainment <G!>.  My problem is that my ISPs newsgroup 
server seems to miss many of the posts.  

Does anyone know of any ISPs with better coverage?  I'm looking for an 
ISP/Newsgroup provider combo rather than a separate newsgroup provider, as 
I pay too many monthly fees already, but I'm willing to consider other 
options.

Thanks!

Aimee
