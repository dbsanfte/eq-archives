In no way does that mean I wasn't aware of what a ZEM was. It just
means I assumed a non-zero number was a positive modifier. Get it?

WRONG. What is it about not knowing that a non-zero number was the
default is so hard for you to understand?

If people like you can get degrees I weep for the future.

No you wouldn't, since I have repeatedly pointed out that that was the
case. You, however, were looking for a fight. Perhaps you had just got
done sucking Haddick's balls in game and didn't like him being
questioned, I don't know, but whatever it was, STOP.
