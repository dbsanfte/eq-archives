I think it was the one they claimed didn't exist, then admitted it, then
fixed it (allegadly), then broke it again the next patch.

If somebody is nearer to the mob than you, and on the Hate list, then FD
doesn't work period.

Vindi has to be the worst mob for FD bugs, whenever I pull him, I have to FD
WAY AWAY from the raid, just so rampage doesn't beat me to death.  I can do
15 points of damage (shuriken) the entire fight, and endless FD's WONT get
me off his rampage list

>  Pre-50 mob though is pretty sad!

no shit.  I couldn't run (or do anything else, really) though, other than
die, bitch, and petition... it wasn't your average pre-50 mob though.

We were doing Cazic (the mob) so when a guild necro asked me if I wanted to
break PoF with him, i thought sure.. its decent exp with 2 people, and gives
us an early start on the raid.

Dieing in a fully popped PoF (minus 5 or so wanderers we killed at the
bunker) while most of your guild is still at school/work/sleeping whatever,
is really bad for getting a C.R....

I ended up having to run back in (naked and friggin blind) loot with no rez,
and bitching at the (unsurprisingly) useless GM
