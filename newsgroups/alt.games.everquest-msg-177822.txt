Or, better yet, look at the NetGear and the LinkSys ( and any other 
inexpensive one ), compare the different options they offer, and go with 
the one that provides what you need and has the flexibility you will want

Then, let us know which one you went with, and we'll let you know anything 
EQ specific you need to do, like the very _simple_ BIOS fix for the 
LinkSys.
