I can understand what you are saying here, but the truth of the matter is
that at many stages of the game there are things that we must do that ARE
NOT fun.  They are boring, tedious and redundant.  Raising skills
(especially trade-skills), camping a MOB for a particular drop and
slaughtering greens for faction are pretty boring with not a lot of fun
involved.  We do these things, because at the end we are rewarded in some
way.  Either with a new item, better skill, or the ability to complete a
quest etc...  With these new skills and items, we then have fun.

When some people refer to the game as "work" I know what they mean.  There
are times when the game is a lot of work.  (Usually that is when I take a
break)  It will be disappointing to see everything that I have already
accomplished in the game become useless.  I don't think I'll require
medication or hospitalization to deal with it, but if I said I felt happy
about it I would be lying.
