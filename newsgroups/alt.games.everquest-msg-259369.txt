Oh man... Pixtt Xxeric Kex is 1 demoralising bitch.

Ironically its the kind of on edge fight that I love in EQ... but man have
we quickly grown to hate Tacvi in the few weeks we've been there.
Shes like a mob cockblock, 25 times harder than anything you ever killed
prior to her... and because of the (poor) zone design, after the
ridiculously hard work required in gaining access, you don't get to enjoy
any rewards from it :(

You zone in to ikkinz 9 (long stanging joke..) and pull the sole trash mob
(a 5k ae ramping mob with no loots!) and then reach Xxeric Kex.  Enjoy this
room, its going to be your home for the next 2 weeks while you wipe and wipe
(ok) without making any progress whatsoever (the problem).

Tacvi has been a sad letdown so far because of that, we don't mind difficult
encounters at all, infact we really relish them... the fight is smart in
what she does and each twist of the battle, but when she can (and does) 1
round your tank (and the rest of your raid) as early as 97%... it seems
every night we'd have say 2 runs where we get her down to 15-30% (which was
ok, albeit not progress), the times that a tank would die at 100% (initial
engagement), or even worse, dies at 97% so she 1 rounds the rest of your
raid.. the slightest miniscule fuckup (which is equally based on things out
of our control such as lag, as things like players goofing) and you have 20
mins minimum downtime to rebuff, reposition, re-med etc.  30 mins downtime
for 10 seconds action repeated even twice in a night seems to be a real
moral killer for us.

Oddly enough, it all came together last night. After another dismal day of
wiping (people know when Tacvi is on the menu they WILL be losing multiple
little bubbles of experience), with all the downtime and waiting I mentioned
above that makes people lose focus and get pissy (i.e not at their best..)
When I said above we got her to 15%.. well due to the nature of the fight
thats actually more like 45% of her "whole" hitpoints.. (think of a LoH type
ability that heals about 200,000 hit points).

For some reason we killed her in what I can only describe as exactly 100%
perfect form.. not 90%,or 99%, becaue even 99% still means a wipe or a very
very zerged finish (the other guilds in my serverwide channel that have
killed her all had anything from 5 to 15 people still standing at the end..
which when you consider she 1 rounds EVERYBODY, means they were mere seconds
from total wipe).  We won with 5 people tops dead (including the MT who died
at 0%, which is cool! when you win).

I don't know if anybody ever killed her smoother, but I also don't know if
we will ever kill her as smooth again, nor can I even say with confidence
that when she next respawns we will kill her without any wipes.  This is the
part that I mentioned at the start, the kind of fight that I simply love in
EQ, where the tension is so high that killing it doesnt automatically make
it a farm mob... but the insanity of her DPS (which is the only way SOE
knows to make mobs incredibly hard) has just gone through the roof. 18,000+
damage in ONE round of melee -- what the fuck is that all about.

We want challenges, the harder the better, but wiping to a mob inside 10
seconds because of a miniscule 1 second lag period on a cleric... thats not
a challenge, thats just retarded.  Oh well, it makes the victory all the
more sweeter when you have to work so hard for it!
