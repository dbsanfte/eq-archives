Need before Greed. Usually means that if some thing drops from
a kill that one of the party/raid members can immediately use then
they get the item by default.

However, if any of the party members disagrees with this policy
it can lead to much arguing etc.

The problem with NBG is how do you know if someone is lying
and just wearing crap gear so that can just get the item to sell it?

Then you don't need to worry about this until you start grouping
with strangers.
