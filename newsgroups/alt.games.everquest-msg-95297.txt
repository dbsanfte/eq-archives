    If they are all close friends of you and your
buddy why would you want to potentially mess that
up by doing an open invitation on this board, and
I'm guessing, in the game?  I'm on Drinal.  Say I
take you up on that offer.  Then say I turn out to 
be a real jerk.  Sure, you would probably drop me
after a while, but not before I'd done some serious
reputation damage to your guild.
    Now, OTOH, if you happened to group with me, and
liked my playing style and personality, I could see
you inviting me in.  And I might even accept.  But
honestly, I've _very_ skeptical of having my name(s)
associated with a guild that does open invites.
   None of my characters are guilded, btw.
Maybe I'm too much of a snob or something.

Annie  <--- Kinda thinking of joining one, though
            if it doesn't do open invites.
