I make $50 an hour (yeah, I'm cheap, I know) sitting at home writing
software, and I don't have to deal with people directly - just via
email. In short, it's heaven. You'd have to pay me one bloody hell of
a lot to do *any* job in a shopping mall where I had to deal with
people. Or wear real clothes. Or be awake before noon.
