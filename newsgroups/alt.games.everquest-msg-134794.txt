Our welfare system is one of our strengths. If that makes us slightly less
powerful in terms of military might then so be it. It's not perfect but
then, America is far from perfect too.

Well, the fact is you live on planet Earth, not planet America. You are a
citizen of Earth, you should be responsible for your contribution it. If you
live in a country that is generally screwing the planet over then you are
right to feel guilt.

Saving thousands, maybe millions of starving people isn't irresponsible in
my opinion. Human life to me is more important than money, that's overly
simplifying the issue but when in Rome...

Perhaps, but also for the way it acts internationally. You can ignore the

for.

It was crippled when we fought ww2. The colonies were desolved as part of
our agreement with the USA to pay back the costs of war. Pretty simple
really

under just as much government rule as any other country, more than many in
