BoA costs the caster significantly more than KEI.  Even with BoA a
melee is not gonna gain cash and cash loot as fast as a competently
played caster.

So, you're speaking of a heavily twinked pre-nerf Monk, generally
considered the best all-around melee soloer to ever exist in the
game, and an even more heavily twinked Warrior.  Now try and do
the same damned thing as an untwinked Warrior or Paladin.  The
Paladin can keep leveling, but so slowly that you could run three
different Druids untwinked to 60 and have them each PL half-a-dozen
other characters to 50 in the same time.  The Warrior will just
grind to a halt.  An SK or Ranger could go 2 to 3 times faster
than the Paladin, BL maybe a bit faster than that.  But a skilled
Druid or Necro or Wizard will xp faster solo than in a group fer
pete's sake.  And that's without KEI.

Bullshit.  If I leveled in UGuk I would then die every time I had to
zone out of LGuk, oh wait, I couldn't even get into LGuk with a solo
Warrior who was KOS to the live frogs.  Besides it'd be touch and
go soloing the entrance to LGuk, be lucky not to delevel.  It was
tough enough working there as a solo Paladin at L30, be downright
stupid to try with a Warrior, especially in the old days.

Ok, get a Warrior to 60 untwinked and solo, then get back to me.

It NEVER turned away from casters.  The experiences of one in a
thousand melees do not apply to the other 999:  we didn't have
fungi's, we weren't the ridiculous twinks of high level casters.

My Paladin, before I quit playing him, loved KEI.  He was also in his
50s when KEI showed up on the scene.  My Druid, now L37, ignores KEI
because the novelty of actually being a powerful soloer hasn't worn
off yet, and hopefully never will.  At L34 my Druid was solo killing
HGs (including red cons) every 10-15 minutes, without KEI.  In contrast
at L39 my Paladin killed an even con HG just to prove he could do it,
it took just under 30 minutes, left him at 25% health and 0% mana, and
there were two times where he would've died had Root failed just once
more (i.e. he was lucky to survive).

If KEI were limited to L46+ and lasted 100 minutes instead of 150, it
would not be half the game-wrecker it is.  And if there were a 150
minute 14/tick hp regen buff out there it would be just as stupid as
KEI is, but at least things wouldn't be so absurdly tilted in favor
of solo casters.
