I was reading about Natimbi actually, and will probably give it a try once
The Hole plays out.  It's been a long time since I've looked at animal
butts.  :-)

But from what I read, if one of those critters resists fear I won't have a
chance to get a second attempt off as poorly geared as I am (due to the
aforementioned 'lone wolf' lifestyle), unless I IGE up a bunch of plat on
upgrades.  Bleh.

But hey ... it's only death, for the first few times at least.  After the
first four or five it does tend to get a little old, though.
