It's not just Europe that wants to take away guns.  The opponents of freedom in
the US are using the war on
terror to attack your freedoms.  The following discusses such a bill now before
the US Senate (S-890).  This
was introduced by that great American and champion of personal liberty (just
look at what his campaign
finance reform does to free speech), John McCain.  Please see the link below to
a newspaper article on the
subject.
