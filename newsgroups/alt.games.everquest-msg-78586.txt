I heard that Kunnark was good for mid levels and had some good large 
hunting areas.

At ï¿½30 its not bad for both. Luciln i'll grab if I see it in the uk. If 
you can wait I suspect the platinum pack they talk about due for the 
31st March 2002 will have all three add ons. Though this is only a 
guess!

That said the marketting department of UBIsoft needs shooting. Fancy PZ 
Zone arranging for a free trial and UBIsoft not having the addon packs 
available. Absolutely amazing
