LOL.  A tanks job is to take damage.  A warrior can take more damage than a
Knight any day of the week.  And if I can use defense against level 66 mobs
when I am only level 57 and have a reuse time or near ten minutes, my grps
get plenty of EXP.  When I hit level 60 that reuse time will be on par with
the medding time it takes casters to recharge.  Groups can take 59s all day
and then when the occasionaly 63-66 pops I do not have to run in fear behind
my little pally shield.
