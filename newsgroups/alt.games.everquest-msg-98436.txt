UMMMM  you can see Luclin in the sky when you play.  Unfortunate ly they
put a ring around it implying that the planet is huge and that Norrath
should actually be the satellite.  As far as the lunar day being 28, that
is true,BUT I'm not all together sure that there is no exception to the
"moons dont spin" idea.  Ours doesn't, but there are ALOT of things
unique(in our solar system) about our moon.  Then again  I'm no planet guy.
