Heh... hadn't thought of that...
I just jummped off the stone bridge twice... bind to half... then jumpped
off again.
Bind to half... jump... bind to half...

Of course I also stand atop the stone bridge every level and fire bolt
spells accross the zone until Channeling, Evocation, and Specialize
Evocation go up 5 points... and medding after blowing all my mana doing that
tends to get Meditate its 5 points.

So my affinity for the stone bridge and my enjoyment of cliff diving
probably caused me to think of jumpping off of it to work up my bind wounds.
