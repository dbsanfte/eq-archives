They can't...

They have been conqueored (sp). 

It's that simple.  They are vanquished.  They started up a war with
Israel and lost.  Too bad, so sad, but life goes on.

They could appeal to the international community, but that hasn't
worked, now has it?

And WHY do you think that is?

Because, when given EVERY oppurtunity to create their own state and
live in peace, the PA has fucked it up.  They opted for more violence.

They don't WANT their own state if it means that Israel still exists.

The PA has lost ANY legitimacy they might have enjoyed at one time.

The PA can defeat the Israelis quite easily, if they would simply
avail themselves of the solution.
