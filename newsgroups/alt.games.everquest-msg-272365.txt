Check on the launcher.  I think they still have the article up explaining what
each of those mean.

The short version for level is what level you must be to get maximum benefit
from the food.  The amount of regen given by the food increases with player
level until it tops out at whatever number.   So a level 20 would get full
benefit from that meal, while a level 15 would not.
