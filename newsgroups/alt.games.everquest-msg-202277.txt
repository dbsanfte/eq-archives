I *think* at around 42 or so I headed off to Timourous Deep and did the
Spirocs in the NW corner off the zone, I must have blown from 42 to 46 or so
in just a matter of days... it was mad XP and 1/2 ass decent loot.

Sometimes you'll have competition depending on what time you play, the odd
druid or wizzy drops in for some kills too.  From there, I headed over to
burning woods and did the giant fort until 52... now PoD.

Have fun!
