Get imbued Vale (halfling cultural) armor if you worship Karana or imbued
mithril (wood elf cultural) if you worship Tunare. Both can be worn by human and
half elves, too. The Vale gives 1 to 3 STA and 1 to 2 WIS; the mithril gives 1
to 3 CHA and 1 to 2 WIS in each piece. That gives you wisdom for those hard to
find or just outrageously expensive slots like back and belt.

Other religious artifacts can be found. Small wisdom deities give 2 WIS, can be
placed in either hand or the range slot and are useable by clerics and druids;
they can be found for 150pp to 200pp each. Better than that, go with an idol of
your deity; Tunare idols give 3 WIS, 2 v Disease and 2 v Poison; Karana idols
give 3 WIS and 2 v Magic. A high level potter is needed for these, and the
failure rate is high; expect to pay about 400pp for either of these, less if you
supply the imbued gem.

For jewelry, imbued plains pebbles (Karana) can be made in to rings (silver and
platinum) or earrings (electrum and gold); they add STA and WIS but decrease
STR. Tunare's religious jewelry doesn't give wisdom but it does have decent
stats: AC, DEX, v Fire and v Disease with a drop in STR. Silver and plat make
rings while gold and electrum make bracelets. Any jeweler of sufficient skill
can make these.
