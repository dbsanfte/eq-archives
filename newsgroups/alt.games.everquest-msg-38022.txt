Hi,

I brought my druid to kunark for some hunting and in loio I heard my first
suxxors.  Does this means sucks?  I forget the exact phrase he used but to
me "suxxors" should sound out to "suckers" but that's not the way he used
it.  He also said something that I assume meant rocks, as in "that rocks,
dude".  I don't remember how he spelled that.  I still haven't seen anyone
do the upper/lower combo or number replacement for letters.  I guess I need
to get out more. heh

Lewis
