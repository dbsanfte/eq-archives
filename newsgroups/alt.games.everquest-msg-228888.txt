I had that problem once, after a crash when some files were recovered on
reboot (I assume some EQ files). After that the eqclient.ini file was never
used again and everything was reset. Strangely some of the new settings I
used were saved, but I have no idea where, defintely not in the eqclient.ini
file.

In the end I formatted and I haven't had the same problem since. Weird.
