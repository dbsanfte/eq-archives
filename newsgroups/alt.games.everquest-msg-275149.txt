It was just annoying for me. I'd rather meet people adventuring or in real
life. Besides, what's wrong with chatting about strategies, or bartering
potions in return for nicer robes?

Maybe they don't sell because the in game descriptions are inadequate. If i
see a potion of comfy chair on the market, i don't know if it'll invoke the
spanish inquisition or put my character to sleep. I just checked the market.
There isn't even a category for potions. I've never bought one. Most games
will have some description like "this last 30 minutes, adds 30% to
strength", but not here. petition with other alchemists as a group and it'll
change.

Adept 3 drop? I have a lot of adept 1 skills that cost 40-100 silver. Adept
3's are around 500 silver. The raw materials cost far more. A better
solution might make the rare materials more accessible so that coral /
silver clusters might appear more often to people with high skill ranks in
mining for example. Making them cheaper to assemble would make the sale
easier, and people will always crave adept 3 if they have adept 1.I have a
21 sage and so far hven't found any coral or silver at all.
