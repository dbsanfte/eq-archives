...CoH has "content updates" which are free. 2 so far, 1 more on the
way. They are planning City of Villains, but the current plan isn't as
an expansion in the traditional sense. The current plan is for it to
be available as a stand alone that can interact with CoH. (They're
planning on only one monthly fee covering both, though that decision
isn't final and is probably subject to NCSoft approval) So...I guess
"stand-alone expansion" would be the best term for it.
