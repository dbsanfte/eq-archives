Not anymore.  That's been fixed for a LONG time.

It used to be that the random numbers were generated client-side.  People
were able to modify this number, so people started doing the seed thing or
using weird numbers like 3241.

Now all the random numbers are generated server-side, and all the fancy
stuff is unnecessary.
