They both are.  My necro has been ignored lately for a few reasons.  A) 
I rerolled my rogue and I'm working very hard on getting her back to 
where I was - level 40.  B) I made a huge mistake with my necro and went 
for pure INT, thinking only of tradeskills.  CoB is painfully dangerous, 
and soloing atm is a slow process, with lots of bandaging involved ;p

I had a surprisingly good time in DL for the short time I was there.  
I'm hoping once I reach my high 30s, it'll be the same story all over 
again.  I'm going to kick myself if I come back to find out a new 
generation took over and went right back to the "asshole" days ;p

That's true for most classes, I think.  I mean, with Nova I can still 
get a half a blue of exp depending on what I'm killing, and she's 36.  
Eiri *just* turned 33, and she's killing stuff that's giving her about 1 
notch of a blue per kill.

Yeah, that'd be Nova when she got her pet spell and moved from HHK to 
the SK spires.  Oh LORD what a lovely change of pace.

Hee. The next group in there gets "Hello, a_newb.  Are you (interested) 
in delivering some (mail)?"  That'd be fun.

Exactly.  Nobody wants to take risks because there's a surplus of stupid 
people, just one of whom can make the night miserable.  Thus, all of us 
group-dependant people crowd ourselves into HHK and live with the 
depressing atmosphere for 10 levels.  I'm just glad there's some insane 
casters who're willing to level there as well, otherwise us more group-
dependants would be toast. ;p
