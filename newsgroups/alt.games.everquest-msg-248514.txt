People don't dictate their play time based on bugs. They choose based
on content and playability while bitching about bugs. If it takes a
little bit to get them ironed they'll give it time, regardless of if
it is SoE.

And if there are 4000 great reviews there is no way he's going to pull
out of EQ and give it a try.. he'll just find a different reason not
to try it :>.

Penetrate..sure. But really.. when people are content with an MMORPG
you could claim the next one is the second coming.. and if they don't
quit they won't be resurrected and they'll just wave and say have fun.

'Oh really? its a good game!? cool... i'll get to that when i can...
but my guild is about to do the Rathe Council. Seeya!'

I dunno. I still just don't believe people decide based on bugs.
People like to claim they'll never put up with this stuff and how dare
this program be buggy... but if it connects with them they're gonna
not care. Heck.. for some its a badge of honor.

There also wasn't a lot of other choice, for a lot it was their first
mmorpg, and Verant's curve for experience gain was very harsh and time
consuming. If the EQ2 or WoW endgame doesn't reasonably start for the
average user 6 months after release.. you can probably consider the
game DOA. The 'average user' being defined as someone who has played
at least one mmorpg.. taken one main to level 65.. understands the
mechanics along with classes and their basic abilities.. and has had
some exposure to endgame through a guild, whether that was say..
killing the elemental planar progression mobs or what not.

I classify 3 levels of mmorpg user.. 'newbie', 'average', and 'power'
users. Newbie is one of the mass of unititiated who takes up a game..
you and I and everyone else were there once. The process of building
the knowledge and mechanics of the genre usually lasts around a year
and if they stick through it usually go onto 'average' level.. which
was detailed above. The power level is then a choice by the person
playing 'average'. A power user I define as someone who can devote
your normal average work week of time to the game.. basically making
it their second job. They then use that time to level as fast as
possible to reach the uber guild where they try to hit bleeding edge
content. They don't care about how things were meant to run, were
designed to run, they just care about getting there as fast as they
bloody can using multi-boxing, scripts, or whatever to accomplish the
task.

The nice part about getting to the average level is that for the most
part you do not have to repeat the newbie phase. You pretty much know
what to expect and are looking for with each upcoming game and so when
EQ2 or WoW hits it isn't out of the question for you to be hitting the
start of endgame 6 months in. After all, 6-9 months is probably when
EQ2 will be putting out their next expansion.

For the power users.. 2-3 months to hit endgame from scratch. Uber
guilds finishing the content at the end of 6-9 months and gearing for
the inevitable expansion.

>In some of the other games yes, but that was because they

Yup. One of the strongest things for EQ.. and the thing that
completely sets it apart from the competition has been the quality of
its endgame. To date, and you correct me with any I might not know, is
i know of no other game that has had the balls to put in events with
the complexity of EQ. Something like the Rathe Council encounter was
nothing short of a what-the-fuck-were-you-thinking that people would
put in the time to do this. Sure it was bugged on release and had to
be tweaked as guilds encountered it... but jesus.

And.. if you give EQ credit for nothing else.. EQ has been a very
strong 'gateway' mmorpg. The sheer amount of people they have moved
from 'newbie' to 'average' is staggering and can only help other games
that are just getting going.

I don't buy that in any way, shape, or form.

i'm talking circa 1985. Apple had everything going for it.. a
non-buggy system with full on graphics and graphic desktop.. Microsoft
had MS-DOS and was getting a very shitty Windows 1.0 out.

And we see where they're at marketwise.

Sure.. today, after the battle is over.
