I've spent the last couple of days working on this.  Not everyone here is
interested in EQ2 at this point, but even if you aren't, you might still
enjoy reading this.

I'm at the point where there is only a 5-10% chance that I'll play EQ2 if
the Kerra don't get some sort of last-minute rescue.  I should have made
that page back when the Devs had the time to do something about it,
but...well, maybe the first expansion. :/
