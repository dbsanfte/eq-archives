    Kaesora has a huge number of neat drops for the level of character that
can hunt there. Some of it is being surpassed by mudflation, but Spirit
Tomes, Daggers of Frost, the Pack, the Truesilver armour, Cryptrobber's
Knife, Strathbone Shell Shield.... lots of goodness. The only two problems
with the dungeon are it's VERY "BYOG", and the learning curve is rather
steep - mistakes usually lead to long CRs. Did you notice you could get to
almost every named camp in the dungeon using only one type of invis just by
falling in the right places? :-)
