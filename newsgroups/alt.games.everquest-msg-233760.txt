Actually I believe this is illegal.

SOE seems to grant a user the right to use their art
in connection with fan works, but I don't think you can for profit.
Its all copyrighted SOE even if a user does use it in a sig or
something. Of course the section in the eula which says this is worded
in a most confusing way.

What this site does is specifically use SOE art for profit, art being
screenshots of characters. So the best people to forward the link to
is SOE.
