neither of you are completely right / wrong ....

what would happen if players had to experience a "welcome to norrath"
hangover, regardless of rez/no rez, each time they respawned?

you die, have rez effects (but i guess full hp or w/e), and after 5 min
you're fine....you get rez'd, you're still fine...unless you get rez'd
before the 5 min, then you would still have to wait the remaining time

it would be giving rez effects to anyone who respawns, unconditionally

eq's MEANINGLESS explanation for what happens when you die in game is
something like.........your body is  the anthropomorphic realization of your
true self, much like the gods, and when you die, you are instantly
reincarnated, at the cost of experience, which is totally logical since 1)
the unconditional respawn system is warrented (NOT) and 2) experience, aka
your ability to [help] kill things, is a perfect measure of your value in
the world (NOT)

i would have no problem with a better explanation for death, at the cost of
rez effects unconditionally =)

exactly, just like every *other* situation when the MT goes LD ...why should
a dungeon be any different? LD MT on raid_01 means you lose anyway, and
that's been the case for years

i don't think a pause button makes any sense.....and if the MT logs back in
40 minutes later, would he spawn inside the dungen and have to find his
group, or outside the dungeon (assuming the timer hadn't run out in the next
40 minutes) ?
