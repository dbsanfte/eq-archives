Buy had a couple prospects, both with 512mb ram and a 128mb video card. One
is a new HP with I think a P4 2.6ghz. Seems like a decent box, had usb2
ports up front I think the box was $800. The Alienware was a P4 2ghz box for
$999 with about the same specs for everything else. I remember in the back
of my mind that someone once told me AW boxes are easily upgradable, is that
the case? Is it worth the extra $200 for the "slower" box and will this
handle most gaming?

The PSUs on the standard Dells are not enough to sport a top of the line
Video card.  While yes, it is upgradeable, why would you waste money on dell
just to replace the PSU they sent you?

They typically sell pretty cheap ass mobos too
