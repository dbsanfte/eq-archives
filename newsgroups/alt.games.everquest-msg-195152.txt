No IR is easily fixed- Lots of affordable items that are good on their own 
carry a GLS effect as well (example- Crown of the Froglok Kings, Silver 
Chitin Hand Wraps)

The regen I think is a fair trade for the whopping exp modifier Ikkies get.

How are Iksar better monks? 

Human:
No regen
Better HTH damage
No IR
No massive faction work needed

Iksar:
Regen
Worse HTH damage
IR
Forage
Innate Swim
Inability to bank in most of Norrath

For the majority of a Monks life, he will be pulling and adding DPS to a 
party- neither of which require regen or foraging, and IR can easily be 
dealt with.

Yes, I do. I run a 35 Druid (also my bazaar mule) as well as my 52 Monk.

I consciously chose a human, after weighing the benefits and drawbacks. Not 
being able to easily bank was a big one for me- a monk that can't bank is a 
monk that can't loot is a monk that stays poor and can't keep up with gear 
requirements.
