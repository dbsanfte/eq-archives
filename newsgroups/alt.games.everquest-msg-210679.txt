Sony released statistics on that type of stuff sometime after Velious, 
which is likely dated now however.  I have not heard any solid statistics 
since then.

Some that I don't see many of are Gnome Warrior/Paladin/SK, Wood Elf 
Warrior, Human Necromancer.

Often the ones you see less of will be the ones with the weakest stats for 
the class in question.
