Verant has not said one way or the other how taunt works, any more than they
have given out exact numbers for experience per mob, or total mana / current
remaining mana.  Yet it can be "proved" in other ways, in the same way that
players have determined the exact mana formula, and ShowEQ has given the
numerical experience values.

First of all, my experiences last week in game.   Our enchanter said that a
certain hobgoblin was going to be extremely pissed at her.   She had held it
mezed for a couple minutes, on top of 4 slows, 3 resisted and one
successsful.   I went over to the mob, taunted once then kicked it to break
mez.    The mob attacked me and not the enchanter.

If you were correct that taunt simply adds hate, then it would have to add
an equivalent level of hate to 3 resisted slows, 1 successful slow, and at
least 2 mezes.  If that was even close, a taunting tank would never lose
aggro.   There would be nothing a caster can do to overcome that amount of
hate going on every five seconds.


Secondly, AE taunt.   I've had AE taunt for at least 8 months now.   It's
the best warrior AA skill because it is an unresistable taunt.  Every single
time I have used it, where someone did not have "low health aggro" to cancel
it out, it gained me aggro.   No matter what had been done to the mob
previously.   But it does not simply add a massive amount of hate,
sufficient to overcome all the other people who could possibly be on the
hate list.  I know this because after use, mobs have been stripped from me.
If I had that much of a hate lead, I would almost have to have negative hate
on my melee to lose it again.     Also, a mob raises to the hate level where
it will only attack you.    Not even once in 8 months of using AE taunt has
the mob ever hated me enough that he is frenzied immediately after.   (By
frenzy, I mean that he hates you enough that if you move out of melee range,
he will first summon, and then follow you around.)   If AE taunt added a
fixed amount, or even a large variable one, at least once I would have been
pushed into the area where it "wasn't enough to get aggro" or "It was so
much aggro I could lead the thing around"....  neither one has ever
happened.

With that in mind, by what reasoning do you believe that taunt works
differently from AE taunt?


Other than those, it's mostly personal experience.   I've tanked very many
mobs, and I keep getting tapped as main tank for a reason, which I don't
think involves my pretty face.  Yet when I was still learning, I had fights
where I taunted the entire way through, but was completely unable to
maintain any kind of aggro control.  A particularly messy Va'Dyn fight from
last April springs to mind almost immediately.

What are your personal experiences, that you're so sure taunt doesn't work
as I say?
