    Did anyone accidentally aggro the one Strathbone Healer that can be near
the first ledge down to where you were? If you did....

    The Healer would have to path down into the big pit, then run up from
the big pit (the wide one with the tunnel out off it) to where you were.
He'd bring every spider with him, and that's a lot of spiders.

    When you drop, stay against the wall towards the zone. If I was to give
a suggestion, it would be this: fight the long, slow way to Runelord.
Dropping down that pit has killed more groups than I care to recall.
