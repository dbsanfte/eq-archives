I started a halfling Warrior on FV and gave him up. It was simply too hard to find 
a group, or get bound, and soloing as a 12+ warrior without regen is simply out 
of the question with the equipment available to the untwinked. The ruleset is 
"anti-grouping", whether intentionally or not. Deleted the warrior and started 
up a human necro and have been soloing him as a casual (an hour or a two at a 
time) player. This is better, but the lack of social interaction (as a casual
player) makes it fairly dull. Will be better when he can bind himself in a few
more levels, and so can travel without asking for a bind in a foreign language. 
At least a necro doesn't need much equipment; can make his own raw silk armor, and
a giant snake fang serves fine as a weapon, and he can fish and bake for food. 
(extra drink in the bank.)

A large guild would make it tolerable, perhaps. Not for twinkage (I loathe
twinkage) but for the communication, and grouping possibilities. Similarly 
regular playing partners would help. 

The language barrier really is rough, despite assertions to the contrary. The
learning rate cap should be increased, so that learning is possible in a normal
group situation. The current situation makes it impractical to travel for the first
10-15 levels. 

The economy is still young; it continues to improve from the perspective of a
lowbie who needs to sell things like HQ skins for spell money. (Or armor/weapons)
