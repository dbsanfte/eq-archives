They are hiding from the men with guns. Good luck to them.

You make the classic mistake . The more even you try and slice the pie , the
less pie there is for everyone. Leave no man behind is a classic rallying
cry. What it always boils down to though is let no man excell. It is
entirely possible to kill production from active people , they discourage so
easily. It is frankly impossible to make a person produce. The only
motivator that ever works worth a damn is working for oneself. In a free and
capitalist society even our least member is better off then he would be in
any society that is not free. One of the basic key core principles of a free
society is property rights and this is what we have lost.

The one and only proper role of goverment is to provide for the common
defense and secure the rights of the people. Whenever it does more than this
it becomes an evil. You assume that enviromental laws are anti-capitalist ,
they certainly are not. The rich no more want dirty water and dirty air than
anybody else does. Our laws if they where working correctly would boil down
to : Do not harm anybody elses life , liberty , or property through force or
fraud. A company that poisons a river that others use is certainly harming
others , and should certainly be held acountable. A company that owns land
and builds a building killing the last remaing upper midwest sucker fish
does not .
