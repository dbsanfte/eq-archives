Then fuck off and don't answer.

They are your own words. I know it must be hateful
for you to have to re-read them, but there they
are.

I don't believe you said anything of the sort. 

Where's the quote?

This is the definition you started using, when you
realised you were way out of your depth, and
desperately clutching at straws.

I understand you are an idiot.

You didn't have a point, you simply jumped
headfirst into a subject you knew nothing about.

You don't say anything, you merely type.

It wasn't my definition though, was it?

The 'idiotxic' idea was yours. 

Have you forgotten your quote already?

"Roleplaying is acting"

This was the reason for all the 'why' questions at
the beginning, to find common ground where the
discussion could begin. 

Since then, you have slithered around, desperately
trying to evade your own faulty logic, but your
oily entity has been pinned down by your own
words.

>>

>Yes. MY point. It reinforces that the broad definition of roleplaying

Your point has now metamorphosed into; 
"everyone is a role player"?

>The
>rest of my point follows. 

And what point would that be..... currently?

It changes from post to post.
