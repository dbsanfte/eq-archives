Well, in our guild, there were/are a few of us who do allow our
children to play. Although for my daughter, her play time generally
consists of jumping up and down on the beds in Shar Vahl, climbing
trees and tents in Shadeweaver's and playing hide and seek with
me when I'm on the other computer. :P

street and yelling things, I don't.
