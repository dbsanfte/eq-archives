If memory serves that is a blindness spell.....

My Beastlord used "Flash of Light" often to chase off adds or get a
few steps ahead of a mob before he had SoW. Basically a "Ghetto Fear"
spell. 

As a Druid you have better (and safer) crowd control options at your
disposal. (Snare, Root, SoW). 

If you engage in PvP, blindness spells come in real handy. I don't
think my retired Druid only cast the spell a couple of times when
duelling friends. Personally I would pass on it.
