The situation: Fell down the well in Befallen and died my a very large
grop of mobs.
Problem: I need the key(s) to get to the bottom areas.

Does anyone know where I can obtain the keys? And how I can obtain
them?  Is it hard/easy. Will becoming a dark elf necro help me in
recovering my body (ie I won't be attacked in bafallen)?
