    It's considered an open question whether bane damage or things like the
cold damge on the sword would work on PCs. I suspect the answer is "yes",
but considering the designers of the encounter can make him hit for whatever
base damage and increment they want, why bother?

    Shhh! ;-) If he wasn't considered difficult enough, you could always
hand him a pair of Swords of Skyfire and challenge yourself!

    They would have needed to code a new model if they wanted to do that. As
it is he can use a default human model with a unique skin. Held items and
robes require an item on the mob to show up, unless the model is coded to
always display a given item (think spectres and scythes).
