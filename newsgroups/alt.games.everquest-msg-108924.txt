But.....
How you play is a reflection of what is in your heart, and reveals a part of
your character.

If in a person's play, they genuinely enjoy pretending to do evil deeds,
then that says something about that person and who they really are inside.

If EverQuest as a game, encourages people to pretend to do evil acts, to the
point that it penalizes them and handicaps them if they don't do them, then
what does that say about the game?

I still remember the first time I visited South Karana.... Hermits,
Centaurs, Treants, Aviaks, and Elephants being butchered right and
left....mostly by folk, who if they were role-playing their characters,
would have been protecting those creatures instead.  The only really evil
beings in the zone, the Bandits, the undead, and the Shadowmen, were mostly
being left alone.  I actually left the zone in disgust and feeling a bit
sullied.  The repeated scenes of slaughter, betrayal, and outright murder
made me feel like quiting the game.

As Taras Bulba hinted, perhaps it's the players who are in many instances
the villains, and not the heroes.  Just look at what kind of deeds are
demanded of a Paladin to complete their Armor of Ro quests, and you'll see
an example of what's being discussed.

Another example of how EQ's balance between Good, Neutrality, and Evil is
set up is the Sullon Zek server.  Things are very heavily tipped in favor of
the Evil Team to a ridiculous extent, where most of the penalties are on the
Good Team.  Why?  Because the way Norrath is designed, when turned into a
contest of Good vs. Evil, Evil is given the vast majority of the advantages.

For those who are not Clintonesque post-modernists, and might actually have
the least bit of moral sensitivity, these things can actually prick our
conscience from time to time, and interfere with our enjoyment of "just
playing a game."
