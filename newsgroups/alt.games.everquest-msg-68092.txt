Yuppers... As far as I've been able to tell...

Nothing is funnier than logging on and for whatever reason, your lang is not
set to "Common" and you do a shout over the zone thinking that everyone
understands...

Walking through WK and I /shout 'Werewolf is up'

Several people in zone say "What?"

I, thinking they are new to zone and have never encountered Werewolf, begin,
in /ooc to try to explain werewolf... Level an so forth

More shouts of "What?" and "Someone has apparently been hitting the sauce
today" and so forth...  LOL

I check current language and for some reason I'm speaking Dwarvish.  I
didn't even know my character KNEW dwarvish!  LMAO!

I chalked it up to a bug, but I really have no clue how it happened.
