I didn't miss the point (at least I don't think I did). I read "after
PoP EQ will be essentially beaten to death" to mean that after PoP
there is not likely to be any new end-game content to be "beaten" and
that there won't be anymore new challenges for the "Uber-Players". 

It seems apparent to me that LoS (and guilds like them) feel compelled
to finish the end-game content no matter what the cost. (eg without
waiting for bug fixes and resorting to exploits) They rush to be the
first. I just wonder what happens when they have "done it all". Does
the game cease to be any fun for them?
