Those damned melees and their balancing act!  Can't they get anything
right?

Rangers match Warriors for offensive skill caps, iirc (offense, weapon,
dual wield, double attack).  Dunno how weapons compare, but if they're
fairly equal then the Ranger's ATK buffs would give them a clear edge
or so I would expect.

Steal with spells, hold with damage perhaps?  Warrior easily holds
agro vs. a knight who isn't casting, assuming rough parity of gear
quality, just because he outdamages.  So I'd figure a Ranger dual
wielding would hold agro against a Warrior once he had it, assuming
the assumption about damage output in melee is correct.

At extreme levels of "power" (i.e. L65 + plenty AA + the sort of
serious raid gear I'll never have), I'd expect that whoever is
supposed to have agro nearly always does have it.  I could be wrong
about that of course, but I'm assuming that in the guilds playing
in the high-end raiding environment everybody knows where agro is
supposed to be and the MT has the gear to hold it so long as his
mates don't misbehave.  No doubt Martin, James, or someone else
from an elemental guild will correct me if I'm wrong about that.
