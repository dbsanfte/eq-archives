See, I told you it was easy, you just did it yourself, evidently without
even knowing it.  Or, maybe you should look up the word "compare."

I am not the entire FF fanbase.  I am one, though, and I know for a fact
that I'm not alone.  So, knowing that, I have reason to believe that FF6 and
7 have popular support.  Maybe that's why Square re-released 6....

What significance does that have in this argument (and yes, I did play it).

Yeah, just like those who waited anxiously for DAoC.

Yeah, just like DAoC.

Your point?  That if it fails, then Verant won't go back to where the money
is?  That's poor business practice.

Shitty game, AFAICT, but I do love the trailer song "Hikari" by the very
talented Hikaru Utada (/em cough... not that I'm a fan of her's or
anything).

I'll reserve judgment until I see what's on the _production_ version of the
game.  Call me skeptical, or call me burnt once too many times by the
lowered quality when the game actually comes out.

As of yet, Sony hasn't cancled EQ, nor are they likely to until they know
it's safe.
