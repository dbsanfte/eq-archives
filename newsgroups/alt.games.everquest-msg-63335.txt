You were lucky to get that, then (though I do agree that it was right that
he paid).  There's alot of schluff in the "frivelous (sp?) law suit"
definition.  A group of lawyer-sharks were able to hammer gun manufactures
in a junk law suit (trying to sue them for damage done by those who used the
guns).  The gun manufactures won the case easily, but still had to absorb
the court costs.
