Yeah.  You can take some comfort in knowing that they aren't targeting you
specifically - they're just running through the range of IP addresses that
happens to contain yours.

What horks me is looking at my web logs and seeing all the nimda spam from
all the infected web servers trying to infect mine.  This is for the last 30
days:

and so on and so on...
