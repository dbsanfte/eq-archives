Yeah, that's great.  If I want to solo I can pick through the couple bones
they decided to throw to the people who dislike grouping.  Heaven forbid we
be able to log and go out and do our own thing.

A "ton" equates to what, maybe 5 quests that are viable at any given level?
Super-duper.  I can pick from 5 different things to do that don't involve
finding/making a group.  That, or kill 500 orange con mobs to level up.

EQ2 is great for people who really like grouping / raiding, etc., but in no
way, shape or form is it a solo-friendly game.  Yes, it's a MMORPG - I 
realize that.  But that doesn't mean it can't cater to those of us who like
to go it alone in a MMO environment, too.

SOE targetted a specific audience, of which I am not a member.  Their loss,
not mine (money-wise).  Well, they did get me for the game and 1 month, so
it wasn't a total loss.
