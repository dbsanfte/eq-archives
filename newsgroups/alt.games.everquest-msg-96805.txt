"Will players who have completed hell levels be rewarded with
experience?  How are the hell levels being removed without people
getting experience (this was why it couldnï¿½t be done before)? 

We don't plan on releasing detailed mechanics - Some things people
should really discover for themselves as part of normal gameplay.  The
goal was to smooth the path from 30 to 50, not to make it require less
overall gameplay, or happen faster.  The intent wasn't to get people
from 30 to 50 any faster.  

The overall path isn't any easier to reach level 50 -- a retroactive
experience boost wouldn't really be called for.   Down the line of
what I said at the last fan faire, "If we did something with hell
levels, we would have to find a fair solution that didn't affect
anyone's existing experience or progress."
