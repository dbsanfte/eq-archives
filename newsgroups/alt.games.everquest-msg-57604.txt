Speaking of the Moggok quest... The new Surefall Glade port has made it 
even easier for Druids now. If you bind by Frostbite in WK, you are almost 
never more than one zone away from a questgiver (except for the trip 
between WC and EF, but you can always use that to sell the previous Stein 
or collect more Honeycombs).
