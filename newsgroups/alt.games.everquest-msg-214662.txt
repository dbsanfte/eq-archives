If you are talking solo, and for that, perhaps hp are not as important.  
Grouped, as the slower, you will get hit at times, and some of those mobs 
hit very hard.  Also, more hp means more mana.  Of course, it's the hp 
regeneration rate that really matters there, not the total hp pool so 
much.  Once you get Canni V, you will want to be sure that you are above 
1950hp by a decent amount so that you don't get low health aggro when you 
use it.  It also helps to have a buffer at that point so that if you do 
get aggro, you are not pounded into the ground immediately.

I have done aggro kiting, and frankly, it's just not as much fun as 
standing toe to toe with the mob.  When I feel like boring soloing, I 
root and rot.
