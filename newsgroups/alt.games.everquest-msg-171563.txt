Ask then what kind of haste items they have to see if the cap will be
exceeded. Even so, it would take 30% or more to get WR over 100% and I
dont think every melee has those kind of items. Yeah, paladins sucked
in earlier levels when i was playing my cleric now I seek them out in
the planes. Also, after getting multiple adds in PoD and PoN i found
that blanket of forgetfullness clears aggro on me every time when
memory flux seems to be 40% effective. Just dont do it as a cleric is
landing a cheal. Go to eqmaps.com to see the pod and pon maps.
