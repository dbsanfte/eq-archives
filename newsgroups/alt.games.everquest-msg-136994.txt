Yup, though I rarely /assist the MT, I just hit F8 and mez the first critter
and cross my fingers I'm right.  If there's only 2 there, the chances of
being right is about 50%, so that's not too bad. :)

BTW, if you're having trouble targeting, a trick I use is to hit the F9 key
once to get an overhead view and click that way.
