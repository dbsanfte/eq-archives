I wasn't complaining.  I've been pretty focused on leveling
this character.  I moved to Lanys from Povar to join some RL
friends, and then some RL commitments made me fall
far behind.  So I haven't worried about gear too much, just
catching up to them.  I'll probably hit 39 today, then head
to Velious again.

The point I was trying to make is that, for casters, mediocre
gear doesn't mean a mediocre char.  (pure casters).
