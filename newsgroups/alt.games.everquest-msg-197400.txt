Thanks a ton for your response.. I have yet to turn sky effects off yet, so
I will try that first, and Norton, I used to turn it off but have not done
so lately, so I will try that too..

It just sucks that the solo exp in pon with a pet is so awesome, but I can't
because of lag=/

Thanks for your input=)

still open for others!=)
