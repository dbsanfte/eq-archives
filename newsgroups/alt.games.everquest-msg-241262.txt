Your card is not a DX9 capable card .. despite the fact you need the
drivers for the game .. use the options menu to tone down the number of
models displayed and set your display to medium or below.  Does this
mean the quality will drop? ... yes .. but at least you will be able to
play.  Does this mean that if you want the eye candy you will need a
DX9 card yes ... go for a Radeon if you plan to buy one soon, in
another thread I outlined where Nvidia has dropped the ball atm on DX9.
