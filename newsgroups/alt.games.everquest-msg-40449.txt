I have a question regarding the Journeyman Boots and the Traveler Boots.

Have the J Boots been changed to charges? (Or either boots for that matter)

I had a guild friend saying that J Boots had charges. All the web-sites I
have looked on said it is unlimited and as I understand it, no casting time
(I.E. its instant)

The T Boots have unlimited charges and have a small casting time of 1.5
seconds right?

My question is has the J Boots been changed?
