You can TRY to get a new CD Key from SOE. That's what I just went
through last week. I used to play a couple of years ago and had Kunark
and Velious from that time. Where I screwed up was thinking that PoP
was all inclusive... so rather than go through the hassel of
remembering my former account name and password (I only played for a
month back then) I installed PoP and used it's CD Key.

SoE tech support cost me a 30+ minute phone call.... as well as a
couple of 45+ minute waits on the Live Chat Support (Which seems to
time out after 15 or 20 minutes) last week before they told me that
there were no new PoP CD Keys available and I would have to wait for a
"Few days".

In short what happened was a guy named Nate got me a new Trilogy Key
and that worked for enabling my Kunark and Velious CD's on my new
account.

You might find the same "Wait" Necessary till they get new individual
CD Keys in.
