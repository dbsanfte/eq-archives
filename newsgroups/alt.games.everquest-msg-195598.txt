Call of Earth.  Had a ranger cast this on my extremely newbie
Troll Shaman, and it lasted thru 4th level and almost to 5th.

I zoned down to FoB, started in on scaled wolf cubs and just went
mad.

Its a 4 point DS, plus a little HP regen, and it lasts for a long
long time.

4 points isn't massive, but in the sub 10 levels its quite a lot,
really, at 1st its just embarassing, with no weapon skills or
offense yet most mobs were dying before I could hit them at all.

I took down even cons easily up thru 4th level, and quite a few
yellows and reds; only problem was that "red" might mean three
levels higher than me and it might mean 10 levels higher, there's
quite a range there in FoB!  Reds generally beat me down quite a
bit before they'd die, so I'd have to go sit down briefly before
going in again.  With troll HP, regen, and CoE regen combined,
plus some use of Inner Fires, this sitting time wasn't long at
all.

I'd have leveled up even faster if I'd trained in 1hb before
going out, the CoE was a surprise and I didn't want to waste it.
Funny thing is, the duration was so long, I feel like I did waste
it to some extent by not taking the 5 minutes out to train 1hb
before going to fight.  Probably could have leveled all the way
up to 5th on it with a bit more hitting on my part!

Ah well, once it finally wore off I got my twinky gear together
(not very good actually, its off the 30 frog warrior I deleted to
make room for shaman, so no focus and not much mana.  HP strong
though, for the 500pp or so I spent on it) and went and got spell
level finished out so I could sleep the sleep of the just.

Paak, 5 troll shaman, Morel Thule
