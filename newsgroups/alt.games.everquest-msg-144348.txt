Well, I've not been to the zone, but from what I've read, the impression I
get is that it works like this (any ubers here with better knowledge?).

There are several miniboss mobs and/or named mobs, and several warders.  The
warders are a pain in the ass, and hard (impossible?) to kill.  However,
killing certain named or minibosses makes certain warders go away.

After you've gotten the warders to go away, there are three ways to do the
remaining boss mobs:

1. Run your whole raid to where they are.

2. Get Mages to a safe spot near where they are, and use CoH.

3. Warp them to where you are.

Apparently, there are a *LOT* of trash mobs in the zone, making #1 take a
*long* time, but with no real risk to any guild capable of handling the
named/miniboss/boss mobs.  It's basically hours of mindless boredom
(probably an unfinished zone...the guy who designed it left Verant, and I'd
guess he had something more interesting planned than hordes of lawn trash).
(If this is NOT an unfinished zone...then what was Verant thinking?
Shouldn't the top endgame zones be fun?)

So, no sane guild does #1...they do #2 or (until now) #3.

If this is substantially correct, I don't see what is wrong with #3.  It's
not making the fight itself any easier.  If warping the Dain is not an
exploit (remember, warping the Dain *DOES* make the fight easier, because
people warp the Dain to where he is going to banish people), then this
should not be an exploit, either.
