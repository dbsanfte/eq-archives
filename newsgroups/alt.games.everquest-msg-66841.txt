I've been playing in full-screen 800x600 mode and 2 nights ago the screen
came up with the boxes at the very edge of the screen...half on/half off.  I
can't reposition the ones on the left (spells and hotkeys) because the
reposition box is off the screen now.  This is only in 800x600 mode...the
other ones come up normal...but it is the best one for playing on my monitor
so I would really like it back.

Any suggestions?  I did delete eqoptions1 and 2 files but this didn't do
anything.
