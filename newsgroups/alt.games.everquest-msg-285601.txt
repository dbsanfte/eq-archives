Most quest NPC's in TSS zones are clearly marked, and some even indicate
what level range the quests are for.

Some aren't marked and are more involved in 'discovering the quest is part
of the quest'.  But it's *much* more like WoW/EQ2 in TSS.

I would actually strongly encourage you to start level 1 toons and play in
TSS because the quest content is HUGE from that level.
