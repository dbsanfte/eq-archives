    What was your first haste item, warrior? Was it a zero AC, zero stats
item? Does that sound terribly good for a warrior?

    These items are the same. Generally weaker than the items one would
normally wear in that slot, but with the extra power of the focus effect.
Just like haste items, in general, for melees.

    In a savage twist of fate, most of our clerics were still wearing ODS.

    That's nuts. They have the reagent save effect. Swap them in for AoE
Aegolism, and hope to get lucky on the roll? Seems, well, extremely cheap.
You do give folks peridots from guild funds, right?

> Bandit rings and
> cougar claws, I mean, come on....

    Bandit rings are on the fingers of almost all our WIS casters, and any
of our INT casters that don't have a Ring of Lightning. The average level 60
caster will be wearing one, if they can get one, so as a focus item for a
level 60 caster it is quite appropriate. I saw the Cougar Claw thing as
being directed at hybrids, especially as it was a low-end range focus (good
for pull spells like snare and stun).

    Now, I don't agree with all the placements. One of the INT-caster
effects is apparently on a CLR DRU SHM only item, and whoever thought Happy
Love Bracers should get a level III effect was just evil. I also think some
of the items need a bit of level juggling to make sure they aren't useless
to the target audience (especially No Drop items). But on the whole, things
look good.

    I could just be happy because I have both Improved Damage and Healing
III, though, without swapping gear. I was nuking during our turn in NToV
yesterday for 1110 damage - go go cleric Ice Comet!

    Bah, there's plenty of places to farm in Ssra. Random folks won't be
going after insignias, and now that the Glyphed cycle cannot be blown for
the week you don't need to worry about pouch farming. The only thing your
guild needs to worry about is the healers whining that they should get their
key pieces first, then buggering off to camp shards leaving the melees high
and dry.

    When the second round of focii come in, the ones that are supposed to be
tailor-made for high-end gear, we'll see if they still want that RMB.
There's going to be some oddness, as casters scramble to get gear that they
normally would have planned to get had the effects been on it from the
start, but that's temporary.

    That is the plan, apparently.

    Considering the Damage III items do the exact same thing as the mage
summoned bracer, and the effects do not stack, those wizards might not be
the brightest bunch. =)
