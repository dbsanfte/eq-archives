Ok I found out the information I was seeking...
Curiously enough I wasn't looking for this particular information at
the time, I was just browsing eq on my hard drive.

Anyways....


Leadership turns on at the beginning you can get it at lvl 1, however
it has a series of level based caps, like any skill I guess, onyl it
doesn't appear to be the same 5xlvl +5 that I've seen in the past.

For instance my warrior is capped at 4, and he is lvl 11 (yes he
undinged)

Also death factors into this somehow as well.  If you or you group die
you lose your leadership exp.

Anyways once you have leadership points you can spend these, evidently
in much the same way as AA points.  Only the skills are more group
oriented.  The one or two skills of all of them I really liked (that I
could see) was the ones to increase mana and hp regen.  The others all
seem kinda worthless to me, but what do I know right :)

Ok one other thing, leadership exp is a DRAG on your regular
experience, in otherwords a portion of the exp you WOULD have gotten
for a kill, goes into this pool, which can then be used to buy these
leadership skills.

This is completely different from how I understood it previously, in
which leadership exp, is basically a bonus to regular exp and will
help you lvl quicker....

Knowing what I know now, I think I will forget about trying to be
group leader, because it's really just a waste of valuable lowbie
experience (since nothing you can buy at the lower levels is worth a
damn (much like everthying else in this game :)
