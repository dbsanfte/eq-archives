Pretty popular on prexus too... 2 tries so far, first he popped when we
didnt expect it, so we lost a lot of people at the very beginning.  Got it
under control and got him to 40% or so, but we'd lost too many people in the
beginning to finish the fight.

Round 2.. ready and waiting this time.. got him to "A Bur_____________"
http://www.mas.ukshells.co.uk/burrower.jpg  before he did his warp to the
zone, summon+pwn clerics, warp back home and pwn the rest.

Half way through the fight another guild zoned in (its ok, we don't mind
being lagged to fuck with your 100ppl sat in the zone!) and after we died
they killed it.   We didn't sit and lag them out tho.. were kinda above
that. Id guess we had about 60 people there, but seeing what happened just
realised the pointlessness of staying in the zone.

We've only had 2 shots on AL so far, second one being 2 days ago.
Gee what fun that was!   "There are 2 people in Ssra".. nobody else was on
it so we figured it was time to give him a shot.

When we started forming though, 2 other guilds just HAD to start forming too
:)   The zone had over 150 people in it (hi ToV 2.0) and im sure you can
imagine how crippling the lag was.

My group had 2 clerics and the rampage tank in it, and literally 2 seconds
after engaging, both clerics and the warr went LD.  We had about 20 people
go LD inside that first minute.. so needless to say, we lost. 40% or so is
our best on this guy :/

haha.   were kindof lucky in a way that almost the entire guild is ST keyed,
so hes nowhere near a target of ours.  Even if he was though, its just such
a shitty fight its no surprise people log on twinks or camp out.

A smaller guild has killed him the last 3 pops tho (they are pretty proud -
50-55people on their kills) I don't mind though.. id rather Sonta was dead
and we go exp, than kill him cuz of a lack of targets
