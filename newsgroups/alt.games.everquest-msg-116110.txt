Well last night i was involved in a neat-o GM event consisting  of  several
GMs running around bearing 2 tags <Saviors of Norrath> and <Children of
Darkness>,  and  recruiting people  to theyre guilds  a wage a huge war in
wfp  i was in the children of Darkness  and we had roughly 75 people and the
others had the same if not more and the goal was to protect out "general"
and kill their "Lieutenant" and visa versa for the saviors and  it was a
blast i jus  sat in the middle  of it all  AoE stunning and Gravity Fluxing
but all in all  the  children of darkness prevailed
 out of  the 70 some odd people on that  side they handed out 3 bloody items
not sure what they were i had fun  but many people were upset they didnt
get anything
