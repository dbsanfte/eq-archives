That's an appropriate amount of attention. Bordering on smothering
them, actually, based on my cat experience.

I had cats most of my life. One died of diabetes a few years ago,
leaving me with just one who had been with me for over a decade.

Knowing her time was probably short as well, I cleared off the end of
my desk, stuck an old quilt on it, mussed it up a bit, and pointed the
desk lamp at it. The message was received pretty readily. She spent
the last couple of years of her life asleep at my side, on her quilt
under the desk lamp.

Two years after she's gone, I still have the quilt in my nightstand. 







Dammit. I'm crying.
