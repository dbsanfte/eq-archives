Huh?   I know plenty of high-level wizards (a few with manaburn,
in fact) who *always* solo for XP and group quite well on raids
without ever dying unless we have a (thankfully rare) TPW.

One of my better friends, in fact, is a wizard who has NEVER
grouped for XP (outside of raids, anyway, friggin' caster
groups) and I can't remember the last time he died on a
raid unless everyone else did too.
