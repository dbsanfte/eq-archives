}Well, there is nothing wrong with cussing for entertainment purposes, as 
}profanity is meant to be ludic as well as cathartic. On the other hand, 
}neither of those uses are welcome in EQ.

See, well, there's just really not that much entertainment value in 
yelling, "FUCK!!"  It's not particularly creative, now, is it?  But on the 
other hand, I find that when somethng goes terribly wrong, I can get 
vastly more entertainment value out of phrases like "shucky darn", "ohh 
fiddlesticks", "jiminy crickets", "pootle", "dagnabbit", or, if it was 
really bad, "Jeezum crimon entley!*"  Usually, if I type something like 
that, the sheer ridiculousness of it alone puts me in a far better mood to 
deal with the corpse run.  It's also, arguably, in character.

*  It's something my mom says when she's pissed.  I remember one brief 
moment of lucidity once when it suddenly became clear to me exactly why 
the Messiah's name would be twisted up in such a way, but it got away from 
me.  If anyone else can explain it (especially the 'entley' part) I'd love 
to hear it.  Yes, I asked mom, she didn't know, blames it on -her- mom.
