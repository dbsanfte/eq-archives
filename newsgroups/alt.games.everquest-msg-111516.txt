Your password is access to the account. Selling access to the account
is essentially selling the account. They did say you can't sell your
account. You think they're stupid enough not to consider that flimsy
loophole? It holds about as much water as "I'm selling my time, not
the equipment!"...in short, zero.

There is another problem I see with your comparison to using a leased
car as a taxi: The original leasee retains the vehicle. They're not
transferring the lease and vehicle to another person. They're also not
selling off parts of the vehicle.

Whether or not they screen the customers is irrelevant.
