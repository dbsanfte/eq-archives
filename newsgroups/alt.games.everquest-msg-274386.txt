YOU would, yes.  I would too.  But there are still lots of people asking 
tech support somewhere, "how do I download the internet?"

And no, it's not simple to find the patcher.  After looking for about a 
minute I still haven't found it, and I'm USED to the poorly designed 
website.  I honestly pity anyone who is of the average computer skill that 
needs to find it.
