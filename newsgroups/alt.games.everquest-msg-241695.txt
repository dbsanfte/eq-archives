Ahh.  I thought that might be what you meant.  I've only seen flames about 
that on my guild message board though. :)

Ooh, I love that fancy old gem-encrusted clothing style!  Cool!  Show us a

Well, my brief review seems to show that we don't actually flame people 
for top posting anyway, just for being idiots when someone asks them 
politely to change.  So I take it back, you should have -plenty- of time 
to be the one who gets the polite request in there, if'n ya wanna.
