They have put a ton of work into making EQ more newbie- and solo-
friendly over the past couple of years. There are some classes that you 
will likely want to stay away from if you plan to do a *lot* of soloing 
(rogue, warrior, cleric to name a few), but you can create several, 
decide which one best fits your play style best and go from there. Most 
classes solo just fine during the early levels, whereas some (druid, 
necromancer, bard for example) excel at doing so throughout most of the 
game.

As far as difficulty finding groups goes, I'd recommend starting on the 
Stromm server, as it appears to have a healthy population at most 
levels, making it easier to find groups when you want to.

Another poster mentioned EQ2, and that is also an option. However, don't 
consider it the "new and improved" EQ. They are really completely 
different games. I played it for a while, and enjoyed it, but ultimately 
wound up returning to EQ. I just prefer the gameplay and class design 
elements of EQ is all. They're just different games.

If you do decide to go with EQ, drop me a line. I have low-level alts on 
both Stromm and Firiona Vie and would be happy to group with you when I 
play them. However, I notice that you may be in Europe (judging by your 
name), in which case, our play times may not coincide often, although if 
it's Canada, that wouldn't pose nearly the problem. ;)

Check out some of the EQ links found here for more information on the 
various classes:
