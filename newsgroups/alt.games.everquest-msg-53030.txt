Oracle robe (Very nice and fairly common, ie, cheap)

Solists Icy Wand (uber twink item, but oh so rare) Give this to a level 1
and they'll be dropping everything in the newbie zone with one click of
the mouse. Be level 8 in one hour played.

Coldain Velium weapon. Procs velium shards at lvl 1. This right here is
trivial to get (run to Thurgadin and buy it for < 100p) and will allow any
level 1 with sufficient dex to shoot through levels with no problems.
Combined with the wand would make a newbie necro an unstoppable killing
machine up to 16 or so with no need to even stop to med. Cast pet, then go
completely depopulate the newbie zone in 15 minutes.
