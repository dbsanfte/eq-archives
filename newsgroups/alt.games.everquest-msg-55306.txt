laster.com/software/winxp/ADGXPDrvUpdate.exe

Sound Blaster Live! 5.1 series -
http://www.soundblaster.com/scripts/download.asp?file=http://download.soundb
laster.com/software/winxp/SBLive51XPDrvUpdate.exe

Sound Blaster Live! / Value (CT483x, CT478x) -
http://www.soundblaster.com/support/winxp/sblivedrvupdate.asp  ?? (this
being the one I've been following)

Sound Blaster PCI 512 -

indicate due dates later in November.

Best of luck!
