Is this a buff that can be cast on a L10?  I thought all of the long
duration buffs were level restricted, so unless the group-buff exploit
is available a lowbie can't do it.  Otherwise, yes, I've made a point of
grouping with Shaman and/or paying Shaman in the zone I was hunting for
DEX buffs for characters who needed a lot of weapon skill-ups.  A long
lasting buff would make it easier.
