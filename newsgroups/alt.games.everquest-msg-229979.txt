I'm not saying that Fo7 isnt generally better than Shield of the Arcane, 
(although if you are in a situation where MR is vital, it isn't) but 
rather that F07 isn't better than KEI (for a pure caster), in part 
because the benefits of Fo7 are mitigated by it overwriting Shield of 
the Arcane.

Note that as a Magician I have two seperate self only buffs, one that I 
share with other pure casters, the shield line I'm talking about here, 
and one that I don't, the AC/Regen buff line.  Focus line does not 
overwrite the latter (although up to TPP any AC buff including 
Temp/Aego/Virtue will), but does seem to overwrite the former, unless 
the change is very recent or is unique to Fo7 (and not mere focus or 
below) or perhaps to a higher level of shielding than my current level 
54 one.

Even if this is true, I suggest that the benefits of KEI are better than 
the full 544 hp plus useless (to a pure caster) stats of Fo7, the point 
you are responding to here is mere icing on the cake.

I did think of one class other than pure melee for whom Fo7 is 
definately a better deal than KEI; Necromancer.  Since they have a 
superior mana regen self buff which conflicts with KEI, and their mana 
pool and HP pools are very closely linked by that line, More HP is a 
very good thing, and KEI is usually not a good thing at all.

Splendid One, 58 Gnomage, Firiona Vie

PS in case I'm not clear, again, I'll state that Fo7 is generally 
preferable to not having Fo7, even if it does overwrite a self buff. 
This comparison is only for some weird hypothetical situation where you 
can pick only one of the two buffs, Fo7 and KEI... perhaps two casters 
are at opposite ends of POK doing MGB at the same time, and you have to 
pick which direction to run.  I also would like to point out that the 
comparison wasn't started by me, I'm responding to @ndrew's claim that 
"overall my [65 shaman's] buffs do more good for players than a pure 
mana regen."
