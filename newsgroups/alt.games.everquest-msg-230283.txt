But aren't all the other stuns up until post 61 also level limited in 
the same way?  If I recall correctly, I ended up switching to a 
different stun, but still keeping just that one memmed, for much the 
same reasons; but whenever -not- on 55+ mobs, moving back to Stun itself.

I also recall thinking Bash came along (for clerics) just in time, as I 
was utterly unable to stun the Chealing spiders in PoDisease but could 
count on bash to interrupt that nasty Cheal more often than not.

Splendid
