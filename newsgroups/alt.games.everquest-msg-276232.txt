It's nothing that other MMORPG players haven't been through, many,
many times.  Sometimes I have had to write off EQ for the best part of
two days due to multi-patches, Anarchy Online had disastrous troubles
in their early days, and I'm sure all other MMORPGs have fared as
badly at times.  Players just need to calm down, realise that not
everything works all the time, then walk the dog or clean out the
spare room.

Maybe play on a different server, even  ;)
