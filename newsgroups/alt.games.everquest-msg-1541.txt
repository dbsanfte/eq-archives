*grin* I've occasionally held off on selling words etc for a while and
ended up with small _stacks_ of them. And people usually always
auction for one of them just after I sell it. I figure the odds of
someone wanting a research component just after I sell it equal the
odds of desert madmen singling me out in a crowd of PCs (they do, I
swear)
