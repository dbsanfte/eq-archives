Last night, South Karana:

player says out of character: paying 100pp for port to Misty Thicket!

5 minutes later with no repeat of the above: paying 150pp for port to
Misty Thicket!

He hadn't started out with a smaller donation, because I'd been there
for hours before he'd said that.

Can't say for other zones, as SK has been my spot to solo for the last
few levels, but the porting business still exists there.  It's *less*
porting, for sure, but it's not dead by any means.

And if it is dead, then go quad some hill giants if you're so strapped
for cash.
