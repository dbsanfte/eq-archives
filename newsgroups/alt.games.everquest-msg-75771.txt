Got this item in Kael during one of many faction groups I hunt in
constantly.....pretty crappy 2hb weapon, useable only by large races, but
the lore/no drop tags suggest it might be for a quest, though I am unable to
find any info anywhere on that.  Hate to give it up for anything
though...hilarious to see my Barbarian warrior walking around Kael, saying "
I'm gonna clean up this town" carrying a huge broom =)  If anyone can cast
any light on this matter, it would be greatly appreciated.
