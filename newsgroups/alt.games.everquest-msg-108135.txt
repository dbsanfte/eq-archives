Only the least enlightened of us believes that.  You either enjoy making
others appear wrong publicly, or you're doing it as a defensive mechanism.
Only a fool would believe you do it for some other motive.

> Do you?

I don't troll around nit-picking others, so the list of possible motives
would be different, but certainly would include my reason for bring the
issue up with you: you're abusing other people in the newsgroup and I would
like it to stop.

Why would I need the support of others in this newsgroup?  They're human
beings and I care what they think and feel, for general social reasons, but
I don't need them to help me validate my opinions.  Why would you attach
caring what others think to their support?  Is support in a peer group a big
issue for you?

This is rather interesting...you think because I am discussing your
treatment of others in this newsgroup, that amounts to obsession?

This is the current topic, and I'm interested in discussing it.  That's
obsession?  If I go to see a movie, and as I'm sitting there, I realize I
would like to watch that movie even if it takes 2 hours (I don't care, crazy
me), is that an obsession?

Be careful how easily you throw around your insults.  If you are too
careless, too indiscriminate with them, you may find yourself stuck with
your own labels without realizing you've done anything to deserve them.

I see what you are driving at.  Because we're talking about your
abusiveness, you think those involved are displaying a certain amount of
care towards you.  Well, don't take this as insulting, but it's pretty far
from the truth.  I'm far more concerned with those towards whom you are
being abusive, so that includes concern for you insofar as trying to get it
to stop.  Your own personal welfare is not what I'm thinking about, however.

This comment is sort of disheartening.  You really don't even want to try
maybe just a little to be a better person?  To rise up above the rest and
shine just a little bit?

Yes, actually...when someone goes at you with something, either a strong
disagreement or a downright insult, you FREAK OUT and start attacking them.
You say you don't care...but that sort of behavior is clearly
caring...caring FAR too much.

"...mistaken about my motivations."  Ben, I'm going start a whole new thread
called "Count Ben's Wrongs" where we tally up how many times you tell
someone they are wrong about something.

I'm sorry, but your motivations aren't exactly a mystery, Ben.  I know they
are for you, though, to a large degree.  I don't expect you to be able to
straighten everything out overnight...just try and improve that whole
abusiveness issue, that's more important than me understanding you or not.

I'm more accustomed to people who do what they say.  I'm curious why you
think most people who mention putting you in their killfile haven't actually
done so.

Most people don't forget so easily.  Perhaps that's why you feel it's okay
to treat people the way you do.  Maybe you are assuming others recover from
it as quickly as you do.  Once a person has you characterized in their mind,
Ben, that's pretty much it unless something really dramatic happens to
change their mind.  They don't get over it in a couple days and then resume
as normal.

Then just add to the discussion.  Just don't spend an inordinate amount of
time subtracting the opinions of others and degrading them.  Which you've
actually done in your previous reply, so I apologize if the comment seems
unfair.
