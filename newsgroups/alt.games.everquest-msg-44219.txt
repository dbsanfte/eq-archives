Sang, biz, DT, and I are peas in a pod.  We know that of which we speak
of, and we know that we know, Therefore, when our facts are challenged,
we tend to exponentially increase in our abrasiveness.  Put any of us
opposite one another, and the fur will fly until someone(Lokari, Cel
etc) drops an elbow in each eye and calls for a break.  Put us side by
side, and trolls go whinging home.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
