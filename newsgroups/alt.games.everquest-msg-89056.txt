You've got lots of different slots. Try both! See what you like and fits
your play style better.

As for faction issues, If they are going to hate you for being a dark
elf, they will hate you no matter what god you follow. I have found that
my DE necro can get along fine in WFP and EFP and in the commons with no
fear of guards. I had no problems with getting North Freeport to adore
me with a few well placed crushbone belts (to warrior guild), then lots
of the Janam and Rebby quests (see http://everquest.allakhazam.com to
look up those quests in the East Freeport zone). Now I can shop any
where in Freeport- as long as I avoid the cleric and bard guilds.
