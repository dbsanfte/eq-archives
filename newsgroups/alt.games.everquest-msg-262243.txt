I just ain't at all consumed with the ole green eyed class envy bug...
or for real class balance should all classes solo as well as rogues do ?

I see more things they can focus programming skills on then to correct a
charm ability that involves a few players in a few places with a few mobs.
Oh my some chanters killed things fast and got more aa's than me. I really
don't care if someone levels and maxes out all skills levels fast. If they
did it all in a day . It doesn't effect my play or game enjoyment one bit.
I disagree with Rumble. So ?
Come on throw some more of your immaturity this way.
Can't stand it when others don't see things your way ?
Sorry.
I still wish more attention would be paid to programming that affects the
greater silent majority than the elite cry-babies.

Just because it has been easier to make fast programming nerfs rather than
difficult class balancing and especially hard to find  programming bugs
doesn't mean that I agree that how EQ should do it.

I do still think that if you haven't walked a mile in man's shoes then you
should STFU.
The only thing that shows otherwise is your one eyed green monster of
jealousy and lack of understanding the other classes issues.Some think just
because you play the game you know all see all understand all.
So what if enchanters could charm monster mobs.
What are the downsides of the class ?
What they don't have any you say ? Riiiigghht.
