BS. It is more than I make.

Huge BS, also likely illegal.

BS, unless their rent was huge.

BS. With a family with two kids, someone would have insurance in a two
income family. If they didn't, the kids should be taken away from them
because they are jackasses.

Cry me a river. I've been in the same boat, buck the sam hell up if
any of this is true.

Forwarding this to the Scarborough Ontario post. I believe it is an
illegal scam. I found another specific URL for this in canada,

www.phonebusters.com

also forwarding it to

abuse@sprint.ca

>Your generous donation $1, $2, $5, $10, $20 whatever would be greatly appreciated.

Bad luck for you.


>Help restore a little faith and save a real family.

Nope.

>God Bless

Don't defile God.
