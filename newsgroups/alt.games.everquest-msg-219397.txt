This is simply untrue. If everyone ran a grocery store then yeah we'd 
have a problem... but there is room for a grocery store, a clothing 
store, a book store, a tackle & bait shop, a guns n ammo store, etc etc 
etc...

EQ has enough trades to make it very difficult to GM them, and there is 
nothing stopping them adding more.

Hardly.

As a counter example: in a small isolated community, everybody 
specializes and then barters. The point of course is the fact that 
everybody can be both an 'artisan' and a 'consumer', provided there is 
more than one thing you can specialize in. Therefore I don't buy your 
argument.

You are aware that there are multiple tradeskills? Few players are going 
to craft everything for themselves, even if tradeskilling was a fun hoot.

Hell until recently a character could only GM one of them...but even if 
everyone GMed a skill there could still be a healthy market if the game 
was done right. (ideally commodities would all be consumable)

Recall also that the bazaar, and pok books has to an extent ruined the 
idea of a local enconomy... once upon a time if you wanted something 
that was made in freeport it was cheaper in freeport, and if you wanted 
that something in kelethin it would cost you a bit more, and/or take 
longer to find... for the convenience of not having to run halfway 
around the world. In that era multiple tradeskillers could sell the same 
product, and provided it was something consumable they could sell it in 
different areas and not even really compete with eachother... hell 
lowbies used to take bonechips, malachite, food and water and whatnot 
into hilvel zones to sell to xp-groups... the players were more than 
happy to unload their mountains of silver and copper on these guys 
instead of just destroying it.
