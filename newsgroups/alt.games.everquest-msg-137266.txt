Go right ahead and tell me how I have militantly forced my so-called
lifestyle on you or anyone else.  Feel free to quote from my posts,
but make it a direct quote, none of your creative re-interpretations.
While you are at it can you explain why:

1) You can no longer justify your stupid claim that " open
homosexuality hasn't been an issue until the last 20 years or so" and
therefore dropped the topic like a hot potato, and

2) You made a statement that the first article you linked to somehow
proved that some imaginary "homosexual lifestyle" was being forced on
"everyone".  I made nine statements to the contrary, you had no
rebuttal for any of them.  You then jettisoned that angle to link to a
second news article.
