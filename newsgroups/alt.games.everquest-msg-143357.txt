A Time/Mana saver is very powerful.  It can make, for many guilds, the
difference between success and failure for a raid, after a wipeout.  E.g.,
for my guild, which has a lot of casual players, a wipeout can take a long
time to recover from, and extend things so that we start to lose people to
RL before the end of the raid.  Now that we have one epic Cleric, our
recovery times has been cut to something like 1/3, and our raids work much
better.
