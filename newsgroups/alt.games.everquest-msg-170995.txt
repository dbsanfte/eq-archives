That's pretty "hit or miss" too...2 of my machines are dual-boot setup with
one being 98se/2k pro, and the other 98se/XP.  The one with XP won't allow
Win98se to boot until I limited the memory to use only 512mb (it has 576, a
whopping 64 extra) while the other box boots 98se with 1gb ram and no
problems.  Go figure.

However, to the original poster I would say I'm surprized EQ doesn't just
laugh at your 196mb.  Every zone must be like the bazaar.  More memory
should be in order.  Also, do you have a custom swap-file?  Windows is kind
of lame at handling that on the fly.

Good luck,
Sean...
