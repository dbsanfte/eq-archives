James, by your previous comment about "a time when corpses couldn't be 
summoned", I take it that you weren't around when the game was *hard*. I 
was there, and I don't miss it. The game is still hard where it matters, 
and it has smoothed out trivial, unnecessary annoyances.

Well, there is no need to wonder. As I said, I was there four years ago 
when the game was *really* hard, and I'm here now, and the amount of 
idiots playing remains the same.
