I always used Illusion: Imp.  Which leads to a funny story.

I had a guildmate once, named Buledued, who was one of those people who 
had heard of spelling, but simply wasn't interested in it.  As an example, 
he was a Dark Elf Shadowknight, and it actually took some time before I 
realized his name was supposed to be "Blue Dude".

But anyway, one time we were hanging out at the combine spires, and I ran 
up and Imped off it, floating down amidst my guildies.  And Bule thought 
that was just fascinating.  Luckily, I'd just gotten Trickster's 
Augmentation, this being in the days before Project Illusion, and was able 
to share the experience with him.  So he ran up the spires, and came 
spiralling down yelling "IM SUPPERMAN!" in /shout.  I just about bust a 
gut laughing at his sheer enthusiasm and glee.  And whenever I bumped into 
him after that, he'd ask "make me supperman! plees!"  And I'd be glad to, 
just because it made him -sooo- happy.

So now I can't hunt anything with imp models without thinking it must be 
about suppertime, somewhere in the world.  Bule was a pain in the butt and 
couldn't follow simple directions like "Don't attack the add! No, the 
mezzed one!  Argh!"  But I still miss him.
