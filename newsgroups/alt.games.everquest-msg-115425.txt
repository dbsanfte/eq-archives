    What? The two races are at each others' throats. Both cities have
numerous quests that revolve around this conflict, going back further than
the recent updates to the two newbie zones (Initiate and Disciple Symbol of
Innoruuk quests, the Lil' Honeybugger quest). It is canon, whether you would
have written it that way or not.

    As for your jealousy of halfling rangers, and rangers of Tunare, I don't
get it. I'm a dwarven cleric - arguably the best starting stats of any
cleric race, unable to use some high-quality gear that has been introduced
since I started (like any clerical robe - for all of Velious that meant we
couldn't use the best cleric chestpiece in the entire game). I don't
complain about it because there's no point - it's not like someone starting
the game will skip my race/class because they can't wear Imbued Granite
Spaulders and Sal'Varae's Robe.

    James
