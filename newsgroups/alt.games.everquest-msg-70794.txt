Your lack of reading comprehension may, or may not, have added to your
current financial distress, which I hope improves. However, I never said
VI didn't fuck up. EVER, asshole. They certainly didn't do the best job
of this. All that the majority of the "tired of the cheese and whiner"
crowd is saying is, the game has moved on. Do you want to keep playing?
No? Then quit. Yes? Then upgrade your computer to this century,
dickhead. VI and everyone else will continue to make use of the latest
technology and make applications that require higher.....

oh, fuck it. It's over your head.

It's not. As pointed out by others, after you spent all your *WIFE'S*
money, why the FUCK are you sitting around playing and expensive god
damned COMPUTER GAME instead of out EARNING SOME FUCKING MONEY AND
TAKING CARE OF YOUR WIFE????

Oh. Nevermind. You're a moron letting somebody else support you. Good
luck with that uberguild, pal.

Well, you go that right. I certaily cant come up with an "option" that
makes sense for you to upgrade your GAME PLAYING computer to current
standards when you can't feed and house your family. Got me there, dead
to rights.
