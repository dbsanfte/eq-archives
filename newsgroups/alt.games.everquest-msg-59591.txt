But with a directX game, WINE doesn't really cut the cheese.

I recommend looking for WMware (someone correct the spelling, not sure about
the name). I have never used it, but i have heard very good things about it.
It doesn't emulate operating system, but rather a whole hardware level
machine. So you should be able to run whatever system in whatever other
system ...well, in theory atleast.

It's price is rather salty thou, i could not afford it. But if you dont have
moral issues about stealing professional overpriced software, go for it ,).
I would imagine many w4r3z d3wdz have this on their sites.
