I might have to say that you nor I know enough people to know what the majority
of people think.  I have personally asked 44 people that I know are following
this story, 2 think the banning and guild breakup was just.  Maybe geography has
something to do with it, I don't know.  But I think you do not have enough
knowledge to make this kind of claim.  I would actually say that only 1% of the
people that play have followed these events.  So all in all you are right, there
is going to be very little outcome, I think, either way.
