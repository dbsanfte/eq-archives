I *like* the bard mail quests. For those who travel a lot by foot, like
myself, they are great little mindless faction builders. While I don't get a
lick of experience for them at this point, the faction hits are nice.
Whenever I'm in a city, I always grab some mail from one of the bards and
hold it aside. If I ever end up at the delivery point, I drop it off and
grab some more. I think there are three letters on my ranger right now.

To me, it's just another stop while I'm in town, like turning in coppers at
the bank or restocking on arrows. Without a second thought, I'm kindly with
the bards. When in cities where I have sub-par faction, I can usually find a
bard merchant to give me decent prices to sell off some loot. Kelethin is a
good example of that. I loathe spending time in GFay, so my faction has
never been greatly improved there ... but those bards help me out.

All that being said, it *is* a worthless quest for both experience and loot.
You just have to take it for what it is.
