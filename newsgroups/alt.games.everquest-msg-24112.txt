Yes, I do.

Problem I found is, that it's on the dull side of the world which I
spend little to no time in, hell, I run my alts out of there when they
hit 10, also that it's a pain in the ass to get in and out of  there
when your an evil character without a port handy and if you are a good
character there are those three NPCs at the entrance that beat up on
you if your not careful. I always thought the warrens were placed
where they were to convince people to play characters out of Painel.
All that time to create that city and it's mostly a ghost town once
the novelty wore off and before the warrens.

As for the loot rules; sit in the rathe mountains and watch a level 57
caster clean out the HGs three to four at a time just for the LeWtZ
while all of you who could be getting exp fight with similar parties
over the scraps.

On the bright side; instead of filling high levelers pockets with hard
earned lowbie cash because they can't get their hands on an item
because it's camped by farmers, Farmers will have to reach into their
own deep pockets to get their hands on said item for their twinks or
even main, if the only way they know to get an item or extra plat is
to farm something instead of grouping and price gouging.
