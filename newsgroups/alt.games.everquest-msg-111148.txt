I guess you know how to make hotkeys, if not u *must* RTFM.
Here is an exemple of a hotkey for the "Attack" combat skill that 
you will use often.
First line: /doability 1 (if it is the first combat skill listed)
Second line: /doability 6 (if Sense Heading is the first ability 
listed)

General syntax: /doability n
where n is a number from 1 up to 10, the first five ones are combat 
skill as listed on the combat buttons, and the last five ones are 
abilities.

Here is a link to a page talking about making hotkeys:
- Game commands: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/game_Commands.htm
- Beginner: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/Starting.htm
  ( a paragraph exists about hoskeys)

Farewell,
/wave
