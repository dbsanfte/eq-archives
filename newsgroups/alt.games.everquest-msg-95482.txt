You don't need to turn, if you mean turn to face the mob, you can cast just
as effectively with your back facing the mob.  It's a good idea to turn
slightly in place when you stop, as, if you stop and cast immediately, you
will likely be interrupted.  Back when I still kited mobs, I would run,
stop, turn slightly counting to 2, cast nuke, run, repeat until mob starts
to run away or is dead.  Now, I just root and rot.
