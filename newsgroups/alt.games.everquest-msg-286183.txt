At first, I would play only in traditional mode, thinking that windowed mode 
slowed game play.   Then my guild began to use Ventrilo for voice 
communication and I wanted to take a fast look to see to whom the voice 
belonged.  So, I used windowed mode all of the time and noticed no real 
problem.

Now, here is my issue.  The usual appearance of windowed mode in game is one 
horizontal bar at the top of my screen.  BUT, sometimes another task bar is 
added at the bottom of the screen and this is the PROBLEM.  It blocks 
important material.  Camping does not clear it, nor does camping and 
completely shutting off the computer nor does a patch of EQ.  In the past I 
have just worked around it and eventually it corrected itself.   However, I 
wonder if you folk have a remedy for getting rid of the bottom task bar in 
the EQ windowed mode.
