4 or so years ago when I started playing it all seems sort of magical
and amazing.  My wife convinced me to journey from GFay all the way
over to Qeynos which was just an amazing, enormous odyssey (at level
10 or so, having no clue or maps or whatever).  

All that was great and exciting as a newbie player.  But it seems like
"the Vision" implies things like taking the boats instead of free
ports, yelling for binds, etc etc etc... stuff that would be
intolerable to high level players who simply want to get someplace,
bind, and play.  I actually think the ongoing development of the game
has been amazing in terms of addressing the most common complaints of
the players, while maintaining some reasonable game balance.
