I hear talk about druids having trouble finding a group, but when I join
pick-up groups there is almost always a druid in the group.  The problem may
be that because druids are one of the most commonly played classes that
pick-up groups may already have one and would prefer to take different class
for their open spots.  Quite possibly, it's not that people don't want
druids in a group, it's that there is more competition in your class.
