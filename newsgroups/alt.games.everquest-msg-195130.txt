this makes the third rumor I've read about KEI.

1) they were making it 46+ only.

2) they were making it 60+ only

3) (yours) they are making it self only.

let's throw in that Druids can cast it now at level 34, if you're a
non-casting class, it does for your hitpoints what it does for mana, it will
be sold off vendors for 3 gold 2 silver and all new enchanters will be able
to cast it from level 1 on.
