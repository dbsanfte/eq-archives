Not yet.

Enforcement has not yet begun on the mini-SDMCAs. In order for the MPAA's 
little end-run around the Federal House and Senate to work, they have to 
sneak it in as a sleeper and get the infrastructure in place. They are 
trying to get all the states to adopt this, since state lawmaking practices 
are a little less visible[1] than federal ones.

What I *have* proven, and anyone with one whit of intelligence can see, is 
that the predecessor to this bill, which has less power, has already been 
raped and pillaged for the good of the DMCA, RIAA, and other corporation in 
ways the senators and congressmen had not thought about. It is not 
rescinded (as you seem to think it would have been immediately) nor has it 
yet been amended- and it has been there and being abused for 4+ years.

Once again, you are talking out your ass about something you (obviously) 
know sweet FA about and ignoring direct proof of abuse of a VERY similar 
bill, which was pushed by the same people with the same stated goal and the 
same hidden agenda. If you can't draw the parallel there, then it is pretty 
obvious this argument won't go anywhere. I will continue producing proof, 
you will continue saying "Nuh uh!".
