    INT almost capped (and when you get to post-60 you can change stat foods
to keep him capped until 63), great HPs for the level, resists just a shade
below raid quality for the level, and the three biggest foci you need
(Improved Damage, Mana Pres, Summoning Efficiency). If you replaced the
Diamond Wedding Band with a Ring of Lightning, I'd say you're done! Oh, and
do something about that hat - it makes you look like a dork. ;-)
