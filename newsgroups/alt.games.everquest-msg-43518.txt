Hmm, another one that I'm not even sure I'm remembering correctly: faction
messages.  Am I insane?  I think they put them in 1 or 2 weeks after launch.
I think I heard that they had them in beta (but with numerical amounts), took
them out for release but then changed their minds and put them back in.

I shudder to think what faction work would be like without them.

I used to actually enjoy the boat rides (then I made a druid, /grin).  I think
I must be the only person who played at launch that never had any boat
mishaps, and I sent my dwarf between butcherblock and freeport often.  I swear
I used to be able to see everyone else on the boat too, instead of having
folks blink in and out randomly like they do now.  It was a very social thing
(one more "I'm the king of the world" joke and I jump), and something that I
felt really added to the game.

But, like I said, then I made a druid :)
