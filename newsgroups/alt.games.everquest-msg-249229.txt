I believe you, but now that we've all had time to digest how things like
PoK and LDoN have affected the game, it seems you are increasingly in the
minority.

I will admit my views are hardcore and probably don't represent most
opinions in general.  I didn't like the Nexus either, or even
Soulbinders.  Admittedly, I liked the idea of the Bazaar, but not the
implementation.  "One zone fits all" solutions like the Bazaar and PoK
are almost always a mistake, in my opinion.

At the time, I had a feeling we'd see more of the same in future
expansions, and I was right.  As it stands, I'm surprised we don't see
NPCs that can buff, rez, etc.  Anyway, this has been discussed to
death.  Alternatives to serving every level 1 newbie travel to the four
corners of Norrath on a silver platter was not the right answer, in my
opinion, and it's refreshing to find people finally agreeing with me!
