I think NWN will be the role players dream.  However, as you say, it is not
really massively multiplayer.  Its kind of a genre buster, actaully.

Honostly I don't think massively multiplayer is very condusive to role
playing, as role playing is a very subjective term.  Each game will have its
offerings.
