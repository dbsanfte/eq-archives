Still useful. It's faster to press a button on the keyboard twice for me
than it is to have to try to get my mouse to the right gems. Using hotkeys
for single spells has made a huge difference for me.

I think he was saying that using pause would give you the inability to cast
anything else during that time. Sometimes you need to cast a couple stuns in
a row, and sometimes you only need one, ie: just need a successful stun to
get off a mez. Personally, I have 2 or 3 single stun hotkeys up instead of
having them all in one, but I can see why he would do it.
