If that were the case. The guild was not trying to make the transition.
We have always had players pass through on their way "up" to raiding
guilds. In fact most of us considered the guild to be a "farm team".
Myself, I'm not interested in the raid grind and was quite happy to help
people prepare their alts for said transition. As I mentioned, a few,
about a dozen or so, have gone to raid guilds. In conversations with
them, they are as mystified as myself as to why so many would deguild
and just quit without a by your leave.... These people are nowhere to be
seen. They have not changed guilds. They are gone as if a UFO swooped
'em up.
