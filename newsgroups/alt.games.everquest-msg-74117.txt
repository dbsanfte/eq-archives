  No.  Well, maybe.  I do believe you can give coins to NPCs and if
you kill that NPC, they will have all the coins you gave them.  So
that might work.  Obviously you would probably want to test this
first, and use a mob that you're certain you can kill and one that
doesn't wander around.

  Good luck.
