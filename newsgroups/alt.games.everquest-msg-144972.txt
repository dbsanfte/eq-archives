Just a little change of pace from people who complain about a certain class
being nerfed.  I actually WANT my bard nerfed...
My case is only the fact that we can melee hand-to-hand while playing an
instrument.  This should change.  Allow me explain...

In real life I play:
Bass (main instrument)
Drums
Guitar
Keyboard/piano
Harmonica
Spoons

And in all my years of playing several instruments I just can't seem to be
able to get off a cuff, punch, or bitch-slap while playing an instrument.  I
can occasionally get off a kick to my Schipperke if the little bastard is
barking at the wind while I'm playing, but that's about it.
Of course I wouldn't actually want anything nerfed, it's just that I think a
watered-down kick would have been more logical and realistic.

Anyone else notice anything about a class that just doesn't make sense?
On the other hand, magical songs are ridiculous in the first place.  So are
Halflings.  I'll stop now.

Sean...
