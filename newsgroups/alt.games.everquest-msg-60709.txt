1) I racked my Jewlery skill up to 21 with practice points, and have
made 7 items and not got any new skill points (147 Int). How do I
improve the likelihood pf gaining skill points?

2) Have made cat's eye agate necklaces +3 chr. Succeed 2 of 3 times at
skill 21. Also did 2 of 4 silver bloodstone earrings. What should I be
making at skill 21 to improve jewlery craft skill points? Should I
even be doing bloodstones when EQTRADERS says thats trivial at 24?
Does it "push" me more?

3) Any other starting out advice?
