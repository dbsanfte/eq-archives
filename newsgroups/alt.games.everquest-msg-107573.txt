Owlbear Claw Earring  +3 AC +3 Dex +2 Wis +2 Int +10 HP +0.50 Wt
Drops from named owlbear in hollowshade moor. Easy for you to get.

Fetish of the Agile  +4 AC +10 Agi +10 Dex +0.10 Wt  +5% Dodge
Secondary or Range slot item.
Drops in Twilight Sea off of  A Berserk Fire Elemental
Just keep killing elementals til it spawns. This is the rare
drop. Also drops
Fetish of the Nimble Agile  +2 AC +5 Agi +5 Dex +0.10 Wt  +2% Dodge

I'd get the upgrade to the mask:
Grotesque Alloy Mask  +6 AC +2 Agi +7 Dex -15 Cha +5 vsMg +1.00 Wt
Drops in runnyeye off of Lord Pickclaw. You'd need a group probably or
just buy one.

If you know a tailor the Acrylia Studded armor has a lot of dex on it:

Or the Tigerraptor stuff as well. Hunting up the components would
be a challenge. =)

Things you could just buy:

Seen these really drop in price on my server, saw one for 500pp

Cloak of Shadows  +12 AC +13 Dex +10 vsDis 0.00 Wt
