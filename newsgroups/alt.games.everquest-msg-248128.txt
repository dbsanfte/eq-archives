I started playing EQ about the second or third month after release.
 I read my first letter about EQ going poof and belly up then,
I don't recall if it was a fan site eq forums or here but regardless...
after 5 years of reading letters like this they may read to see valid points
then /ignore
or more likely /ignore and not read at all../shrug
