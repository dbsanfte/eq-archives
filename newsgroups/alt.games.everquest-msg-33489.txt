From the comments they've made about this, I believe their main
motivation for the $50 fee was to discourage transfers unless
someone *really* wanted to have it done.

They didn't want it to be so cheap or easy that people would
routinely "server hop" for trivial reasons, or to escape a
reputation that they had already trashed on the *last* twelve
servers they were on...

Someone accused them of wanting to rake in lots of cash, to
which their reply was that they could actually make *more*
money, if that were their goal, by setting the price lower,
which would produce a much larger volume of chargeable transfers.

Instead, they're trying to maintain the "server communities",
with character transfers being a rare thing in the big picture.
