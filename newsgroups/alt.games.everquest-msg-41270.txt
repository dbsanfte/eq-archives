I contributed $50 in May. According to the new thing, that gets me over a
year of the "premium" service. I wont see it though, not that I care.
Somehow Allakhazam has lost a lot of my respect, and I wont be trying to
subscribe to his new service. Not that I dont love his site, I use it all
the time. I dunno, its a combination of things, the last of which was making
a decent donation and then gettin kicked in the beanbag now. Not that I
think I'll miss using the search. ::shrug::

I pay for Eqmaps though. That I remember, theyve never whined for pages
about how badly theyre doing for money, and then the next day talk about how
they just bought 2 new servers. They flat you said, hey, we cant afford
this, you'll have to pay a nominal fee to keep using the service. And I'm
fine with that. I'm not going to support bad money decisions.

Okay, I'm done for today. :) Gnight!

Joe
