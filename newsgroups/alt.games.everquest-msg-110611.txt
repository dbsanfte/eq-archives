Come now, not everyone with good gear is a twink. :)  

In any case, there are other less-commonly thought of items that druids
can wear that give non-leather looks, although they don't give wisdom
either.  Dwarven workboots, gem inlaid gauntlets, those bone legplates and
bone armplates...these are all chain look. Then you have the pricey
Crystal Chitin stuff that is plate look, the new brown chitin leggings to
match the brown chitin protector...

...so your options for unusual looking gear are to either wear gear that
doesn't help your wisdom one bit, or wait until the high levels till you
can get your hands on some of the gawdawful expensive things that look
better than leather.

And of course, after a while you begin to realize that the bright yellow
plate boots matched with blue-silver plate bracelets is pretty standard
druid look too.  

Verant did a stinky thing when they got rid of velious textures. :(
