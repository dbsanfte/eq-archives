They're in Katta Castellum, in the spellcaster tower place - use the 
tapestries to TP up and down between floors. They have research spells 
between levels 34 and 44 for Mages, Wizzies and Enchanters. Necros are SoL 
(maybe they have an equivalent vendor in an evil city somewhere?)

Note you'll still need to research your 49 spells, etc, so don't neglect 
that research skill.
