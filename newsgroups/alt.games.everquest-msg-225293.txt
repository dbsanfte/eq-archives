I did it...I finally did it!  *hug myself* I've tanked in Teir3 without
being a major mana drain.  In fact, I did it in my time-tested
shaman/ranger duo, so it's not even like I had a cleric or 5k-healing
druid to back me up...just me, CA3, Quiescence, and slow.  (Course,
imagine my surprised to find that HoH mobs hit for less than lorok's...and
here I thought I was gonna be taking on 700-900 hitters...pah! No fun! At 
least Lieutenant Whatshis name gave me a better bruising.)

Dunno what I was afraid of all this time, but it was quite easy.  And my
"not being a mana drain" wasn't even because of the "amazing shaman mana
regen".  Had a druid friend there later healing me with his 3k heal and he
was near FM most of the time as well (shaman, druid, me, and another
ranger).  And even better, when virtue dropped, I was able to keep going
just fine without any wailing and bitching from the healers.

So yeah...go ranger! go ranger! go go go ranger!  

Now I just need LR5 so I can tank them unslowed.  Rawr.  

Y'know, I know that knights and warriors can tank better...but there is
something FAR more satisfying about being able to tank these things when
folks don't think you should be able to.  It's like my dysgraphic
(opposite of dyslexic...they can read fine, but they can't spell for crap)
friend working for her Ph.D....you just know she's worked that much
harder.

So, now that I've entered the world of being able to duo in HoH...can
anyone help me get the details on the different camps?  We started out in
South Shrine, because that was the only one I *knew* to have a safe spot
to pull to.  One thing I *don't* want to handle right now are mobs that
spawn in our camp (ala north shrine) or not having room to root park if
harmony fails.  

I also did a spot outside the north hero shrine, in a corner across the
courtyard from the two hero shrine guardians.  That worked nice.

What other camps have "safe spots"? I remember fighting somewhere
once...with wrulons and silvery-blue suits of armor...that was safe-ish,
but I seem to recall that there was something tricksy about those
silver-blue suits of armor.

So yes, to summarize, what are all the different HoH camps, and what
should one know about them in terms of "extra tough mobs", special loot,
and safe areas?  

TIA!
