The cool thing about them not being slowable, though, means everyone can
start off the battle by casting dispel magic on the mob...who cares that
you'll dispel slow, cuz it ain't there! :D

It doesn't sound like they hit *hard* though...they just aren't
slowable.  Which does rattle me a little about my ability to taunt them,
but my husband crunched numbers based on things he's read on line, and
assures me that if he keeps Q on me constantly and we have a cleric, I can
tank in a pinch.
