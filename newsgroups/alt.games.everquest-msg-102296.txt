I have a problem..

It seems like the female paladin models is somewhat broken.. Their "skirt"
of some kind or another stick out in strange directions.. some down in the
ground.. ++ Really strange..

Can always put up a picture if that will help..

What i was wondering is that if the models is all in one file, i could
delete this file, and use the equpdate to download from scratch.. But, i
dont know the filename to spesific model files.. Any ideas?
