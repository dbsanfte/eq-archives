Are you sure it prints to the clipboard? Can you cite this from anywhere?

This is a Very Bad Thing (tm) if it does. What a waste of RAM! What 
possible use could this be considering the image is already written to disk?

On my system:

1024x768x32 = 25165824 = 3MB of RAM being wasted for this screenshot in 
the clipboard.

Okay its not much considering its 3MB out of 512MB, but its a waste 
nonetheless. If this is indeed the case, I hope its not a typical 
example of Verant's programming in use of system resources.
