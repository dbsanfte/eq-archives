Hi,
  I notice that everytime I go into town to do skills or resupply or
whatever I am approached by beggars.  Some of the dinks even have
begging hotkeys set up.  I found a way to fight this without having to
deal with them.  I made a hot key myself.  It simply replies Habla
Espanol?    To my surprise it instantly makes them lose interest in me
and I can go about my business.  Try it  You'll like it
