Hm, sounds good, but you forgot to mention that they have some of the best
buffs. Iksar shamans are also quite effective (and, in low/mid levels in
high demand, since they are the only healers among the Iksar)

Pretty true, but finding a group isn't as easy as you make it out to be. You
also forgot their 'ports and evacs.

Very nice and complete description.

Also fairly nice.

They are also effective against undead.

You put their soloing skill way to high. It should be one. Their group
ability should also be 5, since they are, next to clerics, the most in
demand class in a group.

You put their soloing ability too low; they are only next to Necromancers
and Druids in their ability to solo.

Again, soloing is too high. Make it a three.

Soloing ability is too high

Again, very nice.

 Nice again

You forgot to mention their role as pullers, with both FD and sneak, which
should also increase their usefullness to a group. You also put their
soloing ability too high.

Very nicely done.
