    When I do stuff like that (and I do it rarely because of my slow typing
speed), I quickly add an "opps" afterward to make it a Nindail. Nindail is a
guild wizard who long ago gave up any pretense of taking EQ seriously. So
every so often, he'll inject some amazingly bad "mistell" into guild chat,
followed by a quick "opps" to make it seem genuine. Now, when we see someone
throw "opps" (supposed to be "oops", but you're typing too fast, get it?)
right after a bad statement, you can't tell if they meant to do it or if it
was a genuine mistell.

    Real plotters in EQ use the deliberate mistell all the time. A great
example was when we were in Vex Thal once. One of the weakest drops for that
zone had dropped, and nobody was asking for it even though it was an upgrade
for most people there (it was the ITU earring for those that know the drops
there). Suddenly our guild leader says, "rThis is nuts -- nobody wants the
loot -- let's call it a night". Suddenly a half dozen people wanted that
earring, and the raid continued from there. Our guildleader's default
channel is group, and she never uses /say. So you tell me if that was
deliberate or not. ;-)

    Cheer up. Guild drama happens all the time, and guilds disband and are
created all the time as well. You and Lenny can get along just fine as a duo
until someone willing to accept you for who you are finds you. And those
people are out there. Hey, you have an entire channel of them in
serverwide.age!
