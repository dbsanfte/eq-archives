Just remember, clerics can do more than heal. We CAN tank, depending on the
mob (we can wear plate, woohoo!), we have bash, and we can certainly add to
DPS with our hammers, nukes, dots (undead), etc. Granted, our primary
responsibility IS healing, and we do have to sit on our butts a good deal to
ensure mana for healing, but it's not necessary JUST to sit on our butts. :)

Then again, I'm a battle cleric, so I may be biased in this. :)
