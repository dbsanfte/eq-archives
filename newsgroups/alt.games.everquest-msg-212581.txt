No. Not at all.

You are equating accepting the risk of an injury in the pursuit of 
happiness with deliberate self destruction. They aren't even in the same 
ballpark. You never got on that court and said "Today I want to take a 
really good blow to the head and screw my vision up".

Like anything else its a continuum of grey, but shooting heroine in a 
back alley with dirty needles with the intent to get fried (and risking 
brain damage and death), and playing hopscotch for fun (and risking 
brain damage and death if you are unlucky enough to trip land on your 
head wrong) are at opposite ends of it.
