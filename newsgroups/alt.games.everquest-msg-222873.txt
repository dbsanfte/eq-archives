Your numbers weren't police figures. They were from a survay, which I
linked a few posts ago. THAT is what I have a problem with.

Nope. Because there are a lot more guns in the hands of CRIMINALS and
none in the hands of LACs. BIG difference. Because guess what,
skippy... And gun not in the hands of a govt aofficial over there is
in the hands of a criminal, since it;s  acrime to own a working
firearm in the UK. Even their Olympic shooting team has to go out of
the country to practice. 

Nice spin though.
