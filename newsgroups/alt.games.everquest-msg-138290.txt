I know the term Raid is generally reserved for players mid 40 plus, and
usually over some kind of rare drop. However, I am lvl 35 and I would like
to set up some kind of raid in a dungeon for mid 30ish ppl, and I would like
your input on where I should go. Right now the only places I can think of is
LGuk or Befallen (not sure about any changes here though since I cam back to
EQ).

Thank you for you thoughts and time on this!
