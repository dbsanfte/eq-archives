For a non rogue, hide only works when you are not moving, as soon as you 
move, you become visible.  Also, you do not get any message indicating if 
your hide attempt succeeded or not.  The way you can tell is by conning a 
mob before you hide, make sure you are not indifferent, then hide, and 
con again.  If you are now indifferent, then hide succeeded.  Your hide 
will not work against undead mobs, or see invis mobs.  You will always be 
invisible to yourself when you hide, even if hide is unsuccessful.  Sneak 
does not make you invisible, but, it allows you to move, while you are 
behind a mob, without attracting it's attention.  You can tell if sneak 
is working, as your movement speed goes way down when sneaking.  Camo on 
the other hand, will always make you invisible.  Like hide, it does not 
work against undead mobs, or mobs that see invis.  Unlike hide, you can 
move while you are Camo-ed.

A rogue on the other hand, can use hide and sneak together to actually be 
able to move while invis to both live, and undead mobs.  Rogues also get 
a message indicating if their hide and sneak attempts have succeeded.
