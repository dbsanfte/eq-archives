I just reloaded a bunch of things in Xnews recently - so the few people
in mine are out, including her.

BTW - does anyone know why Xnews might suddenly change its filtering
behavior?

I have it set to only display unread headers, and I use F8 to catch up 
the NG when I'm done.  Usually, when I come back to the NG next time I 
don't see any of those old headers.  Then, all the sudden I get all the
available headers, I have to manually hide read ones each time (by hitting
U) and if I didn't hit ctrl+F8 before quitting last time, all the ones
I didn't read are still there.

It's done this to me twice.
