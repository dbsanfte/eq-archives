Nothing you can kill to gain faction with the barbarians that I am
aware of.  You can try faction building quests but you have to have
enough faction to be able to do the quests in the first place.  An
enchanter might be able to do it though.  

The barbarian banker is on the barbarian rogue faction.  There's only
one quest for raising faction with barbarian rogues that I know of
(mammoth calf hides) and I've only been able to do it with barbarian
characters.   My halfling, half-elf, gnome, and dwarf characters just
lost their quest items when they turned the hides in.     

Good luck.
