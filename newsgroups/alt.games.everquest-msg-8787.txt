I suspect we're suffering from some miscommunication here on a couple of points
to come, but this is certainly one of them. I specifically included that
particular strategy *because* I had a chanter in my group all weekend.  We had a
set deal. Everyone attacks the same mob I'm on. She mezz's the rest as well as
she can. However, if one of them is *BEATING ON HER* then it's *obviously* not
mezzed, now is it? And if it's continuously whacking on her, then no matter how
good her channeling skill is, the odds of her getting off another successful
mezz on it are significantly decreased.  So yes, I will pull off the primary
target and hit the one attacking the casters, including the chanter. If it's
beating on somebody, then it's *not mezzed*.  That seems pretty obvious.  And as
to the equally obvious response of, "Well, she might be in the process of
mezzing it right then." that's a chance I'll take. Once it's safely back beating
on me, she can mezz it again at her leizure.

That does nothing but solidify my point. Warrior:  High HP, High A/C, doesn't
get hit as often for as much damage.   Chanter: Pretty high HP, Crappy A/C.
*Can* take a bunch of damage, but then will require that much MORE mana from the
cleric to keep her ass alive, leaving that much less healing mana for me. This,
I think we can agree, would be classified as "A Bad Thing".  :-)

I also apologize for the broken record thing, but if the critter is beating on
somebody, be it the enchanter or any other caster,  it's not asleep. It's fully
awake and attacking. It is simply *not mezzed*.

And as soon as the critter is asleep, I won't worry about it anymore until it
wakes up or become's it's turn for me to bash it. :-)

I *never* just taunt. I'm hitting as fast as I can while taunting. Another thing
I probably should have, but failed to point out is that our chanters both had
had a hotkey saying /%t is being mezzed. Don't attack it.   If they were going
to mezz the one I was attacking, I switch targets again.

All that I can, Dan, but it sometimes seems sadly insignificant compared to the
wizard's nukes, the rogues backstabbing, and the monks multiple lighting fast
attacks. No, I've sadly relegated myself to the role of having the highest armor
class and most hit points I can muster and being a meat shield.  I do have the
best weapons I can afford, and will deal as much damage as I can, not only for
the hate it generates, but to help kill the beast as well, but if we run a log
parser on my average groups' encounters, I would be far from the biggest hitter
I bet.  I would, however, hopefully have taken the most damage from the mobs by
a lion's share.

If we make the assumption that I'm going to stand there and let the chanter get
beat on, yes. I'll agree with you there.

<skip scenario>
Your scenarios do an admirable job of pointing out how important it is to have
an enchanter in a dungeon group as you get higher in levels, which I have agreed
with wholeheartedly since the discussion began. I did not, however, speculate on
the difference in outcome between my dragging the mob of the enchanter or
letting her get wailed on.

I'll stifle my initial response of "please read the post carefully before
responding" and instead apologize if I wasn't clear enough in that passage.
What I *thought* I was clearly saying was that a chanter who's not being beaten
on is free to continue casting, uninterrupted, and doing the importing crowd
control and crack dealing duties that we require. But when she has two pickclaw
warriors trying to hand her ass to her on a platter, it's difficult to continue
using the chanter mana to our benefit, and she may well end up "standing around"
*being beaten on* until somebody get's the mob off of her. Nobody was implying
that chanters as a class are lazy or not critical to a good group. Just the
opposite.

I've yet to have an enchanter saying that in group. I find it's the tanks job to
determine which mob get's attacked next. It's always (for me, anyway) casters
who can and will heal the other mobs first, then the highest damage dealing
melee mobs next, then on down to smallest.

/shrug
Don't think the flavor of the enchanter matters as long as you have a troll as
your warrior and in charge of the group.  If for no other reason than we look so
much better than the rest of you smelly little things.
