  That is indeed what they would prefer.  If so many quests didn't center around
obscurities and rare drops/rare mobs, and if broken NPCs/spawns/drops weren't as
common as they currently are, then maybe it would be feasible.  I was turned off
on the idea of using spoiler sites when I first started playing and tried like
Hell not to use them, but I eventually gave in... they are a virtual necessity
if you want to successfully quest or adventure.
