I'd go with crusty or ry'gorr armor and jewelry with ac and hp.  For his
lower levels, because of damage caps, I'd recommend a 1-hander (centi
shortsword, jagged blade of mourning for slashing, shaded staff, centi
warhammer, smoldering brand for blunt), and a shield (clay guardian) except
for 2-hand skillups (and for that I'd pick a Nathsar Greatsword 17dmg 30
delay).  As he levels up he should concentrate on gear with ac, hp and
stamina.
