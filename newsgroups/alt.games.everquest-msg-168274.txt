SS Boots: as low as 400pp on Povar if you shop well
SS Vambraces: 800ish
Skull Shaped Barbute: Cheap at 150pp. Much better out there, but very nice
bang for buck when starting out
I like the Frogluk scaled BP with decent stats including CHA at about 2K,
but much above that and I'd look elsewhere
Sebelite Leggings also around 2K
Do the best you can gloves and shoulders - look for STR/STA items for ears,
fingers and wrists (Hero's are relatively cheap these days) until you get to
your mid twenties, then perhaps look to CHA instead, and resists after that.
Katta instruments or watch the bazaar. The modifiers aren't as huge of a
deal until you get to your chants in your 30's, but it can't hurt.
I like my bitter blade for AC coupled with damage - I got mine under 1K, but
figure to spend a bit more than that. A crystalline short sword has a nice
STR/CHA modifier on it, plus is a decent weapon - I still use one in my off
hand. You should be able to buy the pair for under 2K.

Just my two pieces of copper
