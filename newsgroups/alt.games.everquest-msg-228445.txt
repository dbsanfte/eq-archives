Thanks for the link. My degree is in Comp Sci, not engineering, but I 
took a number of processor design courses and so while I don't work with 
this day to day, its not a language I don't know ;)

I agree benchmarks are generally worthless. Practical benchmarks 
including photoshop image manipulation, game fpses, mpeg encoding, 
winzip, etc are much better. I don't know which software is P4 optimized 
though and I probably should, before I start relying to heavily on them 
as benchmarks... then again... if its the software *I* use then its the 
ideal benchmark... :)

Athlon XP+ 3200 vs P4 3.2
http://www.tomshardware.com/cpu/20030623/index.html

If the 3200 can't quite keep up... I'm not sure that I beleive the 2400 
can. And the 3200 price point is quite a bit closer to the P4 3.2.

At any rate... I used to have an Athlon 1900+ and a P4 2.8 800FSB. The 
2.8 was noticably faster. And thats 333MHz slower than a 2400, and 
400MHz slower than a 3.2.  So its a similiar chip spread.

> On top of that AMD motherboards tend to be cheaper as well.

Hmmm... on average? sure... but apples to apples you can get an intel 
supporting mobo for the same price within nickles. There are more 
'premium intel boards' jacking the average price up.

Hmmm... comparing the price of an entry level AMD to a top end intel is 
artificial really. The 3.2 intel isn't *that* much faster than a 2.8 
intel for example, and the 2.8 is dramatically cheaper than the 3.2.

It would be my fault for a) using Outlook ;) and b) not keeping my 
antivirus software up to date.

I disagree. Enough virii will happily run on a completely updated 
machine that the antivirus software is far more important, in general 
then windows updates.

Sad, but true.
