Molehill to you, happened to really frustrate me at the time.

I'll say it again, but it doesn't seem to be sinking it, I MADE NO
ASSUMPTIONS. I merely expressed my opinion that things should be
different. You're the one who threw in the part about assumptions,
seemingly to bolster your attacks.

> Boohoo. Get over it and move on.

I have as much right to post my gripes in this forum as you do. It was
a simple opinionated rant, but you can't seem to allow me that without
going OUT OF YOUR WAY to try and convince me I'm wrong in feeling the
way I do about it. There was no *boohoo*, only a voicing of my own
complaints.

No I didn't. *YOU* are the one who can't simply accept that this is my
opinion and I am frustrated about the situation. *YOU* are the one who
can't seem to rest until you have proven me wrong. What are you, the
Opinion Police?

I don't know where you and I got off on the wrong foot, but the fact
remains, you continue to try and tell me how I'm wrong for having my
particular opinion and I'm wrong for posting it. You are incorrect on
both counts.
