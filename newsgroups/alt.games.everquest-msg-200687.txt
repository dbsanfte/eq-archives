If your graphics card can take it, Dryads in Jaggedpine forest are fantastic
exp.

They have 4 or 5 static spawn camps around the forest the most popular of
which its right by the entrace to the Gnoll caves.
They appear a either white or red flames under the trees (These are sort of
placeholders to get the actual dryad to pop you have to run over these
flames to activate them, meaning you will find adds very rare) and come in
two flavours Ranger (white flame) and Druid (red flame).

Very easy kills, the rangers tend to just melee and can double attack for
101 dmg and the druids cast DD (about 250) Dots (wings of doom, immobolate
(sp?)) and like to start casting Greater healing (300 ish heal) at around 30
pct health.
I would say they only have around 2k-3k hp (based on how long they take to
die and how much my 300dd knocks out of them).

They are on a very fast respawn timer, infact I very much doubt you will be
able to clear the first camp (about 7 spawns) before they repop, at 52 my
Troll was getting around 0.8 pct a kill so you may get more depending on
your race.

You will want to use your air pet for the stuns as the druid mobs can be
pretty nasty if you let them cast too much, I was using my 51 pet proc with
0.0 duration stun and a baton of royal stature with a 6 second stun and
found them a push over.

Now I have my 53 pet proc with a 1.0 second stun this spot is very easy exp,
well recommended to any beastlords out there.
