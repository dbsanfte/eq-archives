Also left out a lot of givens, of course its my opinion why would I
use someone elses? :)

And Yes Good group is key. Was damn rare enough to make soloing
attractive, the quality of players has really fallen off since 2000
when I started playing. Still maintain EQ is a poor solo game, much
better out there for that. SoE has done a lot to discourage soloing
and for the life of me I still dont see the logic.

Does not matter much either way to me at present, Im finished with
Sony unless EQ2 pans out and thats looking like a long shot
considering SWG results and the latest turns in EQ. Really miss the
pre-luclin days, best game I ever played. Oh well was fun while it
lasted....
