Yes, and yes.

No, and no.  You probably -can- max all the factions with that quest, but 
it may take thousand trips.  You're right to be impatient with that.  
Luckily, there's a simpler way.  Helping Tradesmaster Henry deliver some 
mail gets them all to ally (not sure about max ally) in about 17 
iterations.  I'm not entirely sure, but I think the last two handins of 
that quest were the really big faction bumps, so make sure you go all the 
way through.  And the fact you already have an amulet of the haven won't 
stop you from getting the faction bump, but you can always destroy it and 
get a new one if the 'you already have that lore item' message is too 
scary and red. :)
