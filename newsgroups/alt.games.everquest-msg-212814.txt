Try south Ro -
1.  Sand Giants; I can kill 'em at 42 (barely).  Drop essence of sunlight.
250pp - 300pp in bazaar.
2.  While waiting on Sand Giants, kill the spiders.  Spider silk goes for
7pp each in bazaar.  Sewing kit + 2 silks = 1 silk swatch which I can sell
for 25pp each.
3.  After you kill all the spiders, the Terrorantula will spawn.
Terrorantula silk goes for 50 - 75pp each in bazaar.

On your way to South Ro, check the gypsy vendors in Oasis of Marr.  I've
been buying essence of sunlight there for 7pp or so and re-selling for
275pp...

I made around 2,500pp farming a few hours last Saturday morning then sitting
in bazaar the rest of the afternoon.

Of course, this is on Karana, so YMMV.
