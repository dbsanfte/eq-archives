Well, it makes sense.  After all, why is there a shortage in dragon scales
if you kill a frikken dragon?  There should be enough scales to supply even
the largest guild.  The whole zone should lag out before you've got enough
people to use up the scales.

If a guild got wiped in the first place, chances are, they won't be able to
take the mob with even more damage applied.  This would prevent guilds from
taking on bosses that are challenging.  I don't think we should have to wait
until a raid is a sure thing to give it a go.

Which means we'll have to wait until the aggro's cleared, or we get higher
people / more uber gear to give it a go again.
