This I can help with. Go to the gnome camp in Iceclad. The merchant there sells
deluxe toolboxes; they are 10 slot containers and will hold giant sized
objects.  They weigh about the same as a backpack and are cheap!  I'm thinking
less than a plat each; but my memory could be wrong on that one. In any case,
they were not very expensive.
