Still more guessing here, but if this game is going to be set in the far
future of Norrath, then all our characters should be dead of old age.
As for keeping old friends, don't most guilds have a website with bulletin
boards?  And for those that don't, or non guilded folk like myself, why not
keep in touch via email?  I've made a few friends in online gaming that I
stay in touch with from time to time, and it seems like it'd be easy enough
to keep everyone together in going to a new game.  I do agree with the
person who suggested allowing EQ players to reserve a name, IF it could be
done what with all new servers and such.  Heh, I guess it probably couldn't
be done huh; if three dwarves named Gymmli want to go to the same server,
who gets the name?
Besides this is a long way off, who knows where everyone you or I know in EQ
is gonna be in a year or two?
