Well, you might not have noticed, but most Israelis are Jewish.  If
you'll remember history, Jews didn't resist a certain german dictator
who hated Jews with force, and it resulted in millions of dead Jews.
Understandably, they're a bit touchy about people trying to kill them
since then.

OTOH, while they suffer from terrorism, they are also involved in a
guerilla war.  If they leave the various Palestine areas, then close
the borders, they likely wouldn't suffer too many attacks, because
Palestinians wouldn't have access to Israeli targets. (Although
Israel's argument that they can't completely close their border has
some merit...and many Muslims simply hate Jews because they are Jews,
and many apparently believe that old Protocols of Zion bit)

Same goes with England-Ireland. British people (and British troops)
are occupying part of Ireland. If they left, would people from Ireland
fly over to England to attack them? Probably not.

In the US's case, there really aren't Americans occupying foreign
countries. Which is why terrorists have to attack embassies,  and now
the US on it's own land.
