Just got a new song on my bard, McVaxius' Rousing Rondo.

Haste 22%
Attack 14
STR 20
DS 8

without brass.  Didn't write it down precisely, but I imagine
Attack and STR go up with brass in hand, I know that the DS goes
up to 14.

At any rate, I could sing that -or- good old Vilias' Chorus of
Celerity, with a straight haste of 45%.

Question being, whats better, the 45% haste, or the new combo?

If the group has a spell haste on, then the question is
meaningless, as its probably better than or at least very close
to the 45% anyway, but in an unhasted group, would we be likely
to get more damage out of the extra 23% haste or the added
attack, strength, and DS?

Would that be based largely on the group composition, perhaps, or
the gear, or the mobs you are beating on?

Just wondering
