If it resyncs on the cannibalize, then the mana level should drop each 
time it is cast, I do not see that behavior when canni dancing.  
Particularly now, with the numbers being displayed it is very easy to 
tell.  I'll try it again tonight if I remember, just to verify, but I 
watch the numbers quite carefully, so I know when to cast canni again.  
What I have noticed, particularly for the hp bar is two updates occuring 
a very short time apart, I always wait on the second update before 
casting canni again.
