solod in the gray from 54 to 55 single pulling golems snakes and skeles to
walls and root dotting took awhile but very very easy to do. only thing is
watch out for other peoples trains.
also if your going to play in the gray and you get a rockfiend train let
some people know train to whatever zone... you will end up with a lot less
enemies that way, also only use magic based stuff; snare root dot etc
