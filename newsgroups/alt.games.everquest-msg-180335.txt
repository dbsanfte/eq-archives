    Hangon a second..... you have a 61 cleric and you're not sure which
buffs stack with Aego?

    How did you get the 61 cleric again? ;P

    My favorite place for exping is actually the dreadlands at the moment.
Avoid groups like the plague (you are but thats a general principle which i
might expand on below) and have your warrior pull the following blue mobs:

    Drachnid silkmistress, webmaster... (avoid widow and recluse they're
higher level and will HURT)
    Drolvarge Gnasher (avoid rager and DEFINITELY avoid Ravishing)
    Stonegazer Cockatrice (Avoid the other one got a mental block on his
name atm)
    Avoid giants - giants are a natural undercon and always will be
    Brutes - They hit a bit hard for lvl 40 but at 49 they'rte still nice
and dark blue and are fairly weeny... maybe leave them alone until 45 or
so... but try one and see.

    Those mobs have VERY few hp and dont hit too hard at all compared to the
ones ive said to avoid, and they're almost the same level. In fact even at
49 many of the above mobs are somtimes dark blue... although ragers have
become my staple. Selective pulling rocks! My 52 pally friend says ragers
are still dark blue.... that means my shammy friend and I might be able to
get all the way up into the planes direct from dreadlands!

    I prefer dreadlands to KC because you can pull constantly, visibility is
excellent (When it isnt snowing), if you pull the right mobs and learn your
work you can avoid pulling doubles 95% of the time. Selective pulling in
such an active and dangerous place keeps my pulse rate up and my excitement
meter high :) Loot isnt that bad either, often a kill will be 2-3pp each
(Big deal but remebmer kills are FREQUENT) and occasionally vaguely sellable
items drop. Neither of us are twinked at all, in fact my AC kind of sucks
(828 unbuffed atm... but i do have a very high agility, particularly buffed)

    My *least* favorite thing about dreadlands is full groups. The last time
I grouped there for 12 hours or so I made a whole level, then made another
in about 4 hours duoing with my shammy friend. I think level 50 is about 5
hours work for the two of us, even if he doesnt have C3 (its getting to the
stage where he rarely needs to med even without it (I like to have it myself
so i can use nukes and make the fights shorter and the pulls closer
together)... Groups are slow exp, and they're russian roullette as to who
you're in a group with. People who are simply a danger to the rest of the
group are fairly common, as are complete assholes, and people who dont seem
to add anything to the group's output or capabilities...

    The other silly thing is that a full group is underapplied there in the
high 40's. I was pulling *full time* as in not staying to fight for my last
group, and sometimes they'd have the mob down before I could bring up the
second. That's at NE ruins on a mob-crowdy day - pulls were FAST. Cleric
never ran out of mana, and if I recall we didnt have either a haster OR a
slower... Mind you they were very happy with me for the first 6 hours or so
of my pulling, but then the group kind of broke up and I get very tired and
not very communicative, we ended up with a fairly dysfunctional group and
there were a few deaths. (I dont blame myself for them, they occured when
someone else in the group decided they were pulling *as well*, didnt explain
this to anyone, managed to pull a double, and then due to poor coordination
I broke the chanter's mez (was actually trying to taunt the mob off him as
he was nearly dead and kept getting interrupted, should've used a taunt
spell but was OOM from getting mobs off people already)

Hrm long post lol but there you go, the difinitive guide to a small section
of Dreadlands Dos and Don'ts

Cheers,
