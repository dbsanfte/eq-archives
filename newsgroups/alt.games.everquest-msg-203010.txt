I don't doubt it. Lvl 50 is probably a realistic cutoff for any melee
to effectively solo if they can't fear kite. Even my warrior twink
probably couldn't do it very well post 50. 

Not many classes can keep up with a quadding druid in their 50s
though, wizard, shaman (if he has his fungi and JBB), fear kiting
ranger or necro maybe? I don't think a SK or BST could come close. 

But yeah, I doubt a paladin would be a particularly efficient soloer
past 30th lvl compared to some of the other classes.
