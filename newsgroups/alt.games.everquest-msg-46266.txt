1. Probably half the people in this ng are NOT USA residents

2. We should not attack, but focus on the reason why these people start
their terrorism in the first place. If politicians worldwide would pull
their heads out of their arses they should be able to grasp the idea that
draining countries dry is not a good way to fight terrorism.

3. The USA was damn fast pointing a finger to Bin Laden et al, I doubt much
evidence was found at all for any direction before "special ops" were
deployed in Afghanistan. This seems more like trying to make other religions
scapegoats (notice the hetze against moslims all of a sudden?).

4. These are just observations any sober, intelligent person can make. It
does not express my personal opinion about events.

5. My personal opinion is that this post should not by in the EQ ng.

6. to make this post slightly on topic I would like to say I love my
Magician, especially after hunting with a lvl 54 Elementalist last night.
