I was unable to click on links (or right click spells to see details) with
my laptop so I tried loading default skin to fix it and that's when I lost
of my windows. The only way I could get them back was to lowert res to
800x600 (from 1024x768) so the item appeared, move it to centre of screen
then turn the item off so it is not present on screen, after this when you
go back to normal resoution and toggle the window back on it will appear in
the centre of the screen. No idea why I needed to turn the window off before
reverting back to original res but when I did without doing this the window
was still missing.
