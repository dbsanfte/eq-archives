  I made a druid, twinked the crap out of him, and made level 20 fairly
  quickly. Four reasons why druids are best here: TRACKING (duh), SoW
  (gotta get to her quick), NUKING (Dizzying Wind is fast casting and
  will do over 50% damage), and PORTING (gotta make xp during the EQ day
  and I didn't want to kill the Millers or guards). Rangers are also
  excellent, but I didn't want to spend the time leveling the ranger. If
  you don't have a 20th druid or a ranger, don't even bother trying my
  procedure, you'll be burned by a tracker. Now a mage might also work
  out with their spell "sense summoned", but you'll NEVER have advantage
  over tracking. The Everquest NIGHT starts at 8:00:00 PM and ends at
  5:59:59 AM, Pyzjn will only spawn between those times. Pyzjn will NOT
  spawn after the EQ clock hits 6AM. The only reason you'd see her up is
  because she had spawned before the EQ clock hit 6AM.
  Placeholder (Center of ruins) information:

  6:00:00 AM TO 7:59:59 PM (EQ DAYTIME) PLACEHOLDERS:
  large rat, brown bear, giant rat, grizzly bear, fire beetle, gray
  wolf, and mangy rat

  Note: a grizzly bear, brown bear, and a giant rat are sole existing
  mobs in the ruins region and are guaranteed PH's

  8:00:00 PM TO 5:59:59 AM (EQ NIGHTTIME) PLACEHOLDERS:
  decaying skeleton, skeleton, dread corpse, putrid skeleton, Varsoon,
  and Pyzjn

  Notes: A walking putrid skeleton in the field is a guaranteed PH.
  Varsoon the Undying is not a Pyzjn placeholder. 8 out of 10 times when
  you see a dread corpse on the top of tracking at pop time, that is
  usually the PH. Dread corpses can collapse into a pile in certain
  points surrounding the ruins, but this is not very often.


  Here's what you do. Head to the ruins at around 3PM game time, go to
  LOC (4770, -1050, 50) and observe what PH is currently in the middle
  of the ruins. Do NOT kill it. Wait for the EQ time to turn to 4PM, add
  an additional 45 seconds, then kill it, and note the EARTH time. If by
  chance there is no PH at the ruins when you get there at 3PM, just
  wait until one comes. When the clock hits 4PM and there is still no
  PH, constantly monitor your tracking. If you see a grizzly bear, brown
  bear, or a giant rat, immediately begin tracking it, and observe its
  heading. ENSURE IT IS HEADING TOWARDS THE RUINS, then kill it. If the
  PH is not a grizzly bear, brown bear, or a giant rat, you will have to
  wait until it parks at the ruins. If you kill the PH after 6PM, you
  will only have 2 tries to get Pyzjn during the night. Hopefully, you
  get the PH killed before 6PM game time. This will give you 3 shots. In
  any case, ensure you note the earth time that you killed the PH, next
  pop will be in 11 MINUTES 43 SECONDS.

  Pop time discussion:

  If you kill the daytime PH at 3PM the remaining pop times are 7PM,
  11PM, 3AM, 7AM (2 tries for Pyzjn)
  If you kill the daytime PH at 4PM the remaining pop times are 8PM,
  12AM, 4AM (3 tries for Pyzjn)
  If you kill the daytime PH at 5PM the remaining pop times are 9PM,
  1AM, 5AM (3 tries for Pyzjn)
  If you kill the daytime PH at 6PM the remaining pop times are 10PM,
  2AM, 6AM (2 or 3 tries for Pyzjn see paragraph below)

  Ok, let me discuss EQ time, earth time, and the spawn time cycle. The
  reason is that it can be possible to get 3 tries for Pyzjn if you kill
  the daytime PH at (or very close to) 6PM game time. Essentially, this
  will require you to kill all the nighttime PH's within 17 seconds of
  spawning. One EQ hour is equivalent to 3 real life minutes. The Pyzjn
  spawn cycle is 11 minutes 43 seconds, 17 seconds less than 12 minutes
  (4 EQ hours). If you killed the daytime PH at or just after 6PM game
  time, the 17 second difference between pop time and EQ time will be
  cumulative. Thus, after the first and second nighttime PH have been
  killed, and the EQ clock has barely rolled into 2AM, there will be
  enough time for another shot at Pyzjn. In summary, if you kill the
  daytime PH at 6PM, and you nail each PH thereafter as soon as they
  spawn, there will be time for a third try. However, if 6AM game time
  rolls around and there is no Pyzjn, or you notice a daytime PH up,
  consider this day over.

  A great method of locating the PH during the EQ night, is to kill all
  undead mobs you see on track. Do this about 4 minutes prior to pop
  time. This helps to clear the tracking screen, making it easier to
  spot the new PH at pop time. At about 60 seconds to pop time, go to
  LOC (4550, -350, 100) and begin to hit tracking every 10-15 seconds,
  this will give you an idea of what is already up. At exactly pop time,
  hit track and see what new undead creature has spawned, track it, and
  get behind it to verify the direction it is heading. Once you are
  certain that it is headed to the middle spot in ruins, kill it and
  note the earth time. The next pop will be in 11 minutes 43 seconds.
  If, at any pop time, you track a WALKING putrid skeleton, Varsoon, or
  (hehe) Pyzjn, immediately begin tracking it and kill it. If Pyzjn does
  not spawn at the final pop time, you do not need to kill the PH. Just
  port out and get some XP, but make sure that you are back at the ruins
  around 3PM to repeat the cycle.

  Interesting notes:

  If you notice ANY PH "suicide", meaning NO npc / player intervention,
  the next pop time will be in exactly 5 minutes. Also, the decay time
  of mobs in the Pyzjn cycle is roughly 8 minutes. If you get to the
  ruins at 3PM and notice a dead PH, wait until the corpse decays, note
  the earth time, add 3 minutes 43 seconds to that. You now have the
  rough estimate of the next pop time.

  By the way, when Tovax Vmar walks to Northern Qeynos Hills, follow
  him. When he stops to drop the note, guess what else has just
  happened? He is standing on a Pyzjn spawn point, keep a log with locs
  and you'll develop a rather neat connect-the-dot picture from an
  overhead view.

  Occasionally, the pop time gets screwed up and arrives 30-45 seconds
  earlier than anticipated. This occurs very rarely, so don't worry
  about this too much.

  Good Luck!
