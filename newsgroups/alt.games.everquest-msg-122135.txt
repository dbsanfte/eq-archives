If this is some new bug from the recent "break everything" patch, then
no. I'm not sure. I have no played my Necro since about April. But up
until then? Yes, 100% positively sure. I found out the hard way also.
FD'd with two Gargoyles on me... already had one dotted, stood up after
he flew back up the hill, sat down to mem pet spell... BOOM!  

But when I learned to stay down in my FD until the dots wore off, I was
never struck again unless I got the "has fallen to the ground" message.
No question. If it's not working now, it's a stealth nerf or a bug.
