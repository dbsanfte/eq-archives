Yes the Nuclear regulatory commission or whatever it is never
seriously looked at any of the "three mile island/chernobyl" proof
reactors designed in the late 80, not ever supported a standardized
nuclear system. Luckily, there is a new type of wave based generator
being developed which is safest of all and could make use of empty
ocean space to provide power.
