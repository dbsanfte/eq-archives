    Check the apes in the caves near Dalnir zone. If they're animals (and I
suspect they might be), you will have oodles of fun fear kiting them. They
are non-aggro and do not assist one another, and the respawn is fast. Cash
drops are pretty good for Kunark, too, although there's no big payoff drops
like Loops off the giants. At your level the highest ones will be one level
above you.
