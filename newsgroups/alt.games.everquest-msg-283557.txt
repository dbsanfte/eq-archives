Hmm, thinking further, the other problem with mounts is that while 
astride one, you only get standing HP regen, not the larger, and 
accellerating, sitting HP regen.  If you're relying on regen to supply a 
lot of your HP, then a mount is a problem.  This would mean that a 
necromancer probably benefits less from a mount than the other casters, 
and than clerics or druids.  Shaman also rely on regen for HP 
replacement to some extent, but since with canni they spend most of 
their time standing and casting, its not really giving up so much. 
Necros, using long lasting hp/mana conversion buffs instead of sudden 
"nuke style" ones, can sit and watch their HP regen turn into mana regen.
