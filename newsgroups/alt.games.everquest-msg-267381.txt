Decent hyperbole there . . .

ALL-SEEING PROPHET . . . well, it does have a nice ring to it, even though 
that's your creation, not mine.  Mind if I borrow it?

And if I didn't couch what I said with enough "most likelys" and "possiblys" 
to suit you, I'll try harder next time so you won't have to put words in my 
mouth.

Heh, some here are a real hoot and a holler.  I think I'll stick around a 
while just for kicks and giggles even if I stop playing the game.
