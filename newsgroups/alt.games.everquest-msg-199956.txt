There's much discussion in my guild over Doomshade's triggering.

This is what I've heard:

He's only triggerable while Dark Masters are chanting.

You'll see the Dark Masters chant every 1-3 hours.

Once you see them chant, you'll have some short period of time (have heard 
everywhere from 10 minutes to 30 minutes) to kill all of them and Doomshade 
will spawn.

Taking all of that into account, you should be able to spawn Doomshade once 
every 3 hours and farm the shit out of him.

I've also heard from a reliable source that the Dark Masters only chant 
every 3 days (this seems to be the case, a friend of mine tried to spawn 
him yesterday with no luck after getting him the last 3 times).

Can anybody give me _definite_ info on this, or point me to a resource that 
is actually completely correct?

TIA,
