I have had similar lag issues on a dial-up connection, but do severely
question using 2 machines on the same dial-up connection. You only have so
much bandwidth, and both machines would be competing for it.

But new drivers could help too, but seriously man, your already forking out
and extra $13 for the other account, might as well spend $25 or so for the
second line...

Good Luck!
