And sadly, it's the highest spot I've ever gotten a group in. Don't
even know where ledge *is*...
Funny thing happened on the way to that camp: I was jumping over the
first hole in the path, missed the edge and got 'stuck' in the angle
of the hole. As I was debating whether to drop to the path below or
gate out, I fell - for 10000 damage. There's been some disagreement as
to whether or not I could have gotten a GM rez for that tiny fall, but
there was a 56+ cleric in my group, so when the CR guy moved my corpse
just after I'd gotten back and decided something was fishy, having
heard you're not supposed to move the corpse if it falls, I let the
group cleric rez me. (Yes, I have a habit of long, nasty sentences.)

Well, I'd decided they didn't deserve me even before establishing that
the people I knew weren't in group. I prefer not grouping with
clueless people.

"Other than that" as in the bard left relatively early. He was there
when we moved in, but left a short while later.

A single ranger and one mage pet won't cut it, as observed last night.
A ranger, maybe a paladin, and a handful of monks and rogues, OTOH...
