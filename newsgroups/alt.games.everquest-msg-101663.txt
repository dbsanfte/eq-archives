As far as I know they never had much effect (I don't know about beta)

The effect of Int / Wis on Mana has actually been increased recently
(for values over 200)

The effect of Sta on HP is well documented and unchanged.

Non of the others (including Cha) ever had much effect as I understand
it.

I wish that they had more effect, but I expect that if say Str had a
large effect on max damage it would take a long time to balance it. I
can imagine the level 1 uber-twinks with 255 Srt hitting for 137 points
of damage. It would "make more sense" but also make the game much more
silly until / unless it was balanced right.
