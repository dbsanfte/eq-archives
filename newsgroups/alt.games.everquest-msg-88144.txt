Ported me up  yesterday just before the emergency patch

actually it is a little strange.   The first time it said clearly I didnt
have correct compoent for Luclin (I didn't have the shard), so I stayed in
the spires waiting for guild members to arrive.   Next cycle started being
announced, I figured "cool, no shard, was all ok last time, they fixed it".

Nope, ported me up to Luclin....
