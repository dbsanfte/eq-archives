Greetings fellow mages,

I need some clearing up about the focus items and what level they begin
working. I am currently a level 32 mage. I just finished all of the quests
and am now the proud owner of four pet focus items. I have read in a few
places that the focus items are only good on pets that were level 4-49.
While questing for my focus items, I heard from a fellow mage that you
couldn't use the focus items until level 35.  Could this be?

Ok, I get the four focus items at level 32 and naturally I cast a pet
immediately, to see if I was the proud new master of a "bigger" "better"
pet. He appears and bah.....he's that same size as he always was. Hmmm,
What's going on here? Is he a stronger, better, yet just smaller until I hit
level 35 pet? Is he the same ol' pet I had prior to having the focus items?
If so, will he be that way until I hit 35?

Hopefully someone can clarify this for me.
Thanks
