Heh my usual is that I'm in the wrong default chat channel.  Actually my
"usual" is to try to zone out before the critters come within aggro range of
the trainee, but that doesn't always work (they're usually on my butt).

My question for the thread starter is, "did you say ANYTHING in ooc, shout,
or tell to this guy before he trained (unintentionally or not) you?"  If so,
then maybe he thought you were an asshole?  If not, then I doubt you were
intentionally trained...people just don't do that (99.999% of them anyway).
