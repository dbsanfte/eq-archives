Crashed out of the game last night, tried to log back in, and repeatedly 
the process would die, game would just vanish like I'd never opened it.

Banged my head against the wall a few times, then finally took it as a 
message from the gods of sleep and went to bed.

Logging in this morning, same thing happened... but now I was 
sufficiently awake to see what I did, after I did it.

Here's the process:

Click EQ icon
Wait for yellow bar to be crossed with blue bar
start game
Splash screen shows up, hit Decline cause no, I don't want to buy OOW 
online kthanksbye
Game dies.

Whats wrong with this scenario?

Well, this time as I hit decline, I'm thinking "weird, the EULA screen 
is up, what kind of bug is that, I'm not even seeing the OOW screen, 
what if I didn't know what was going on and hit accept, they'd charge my 
CC for..."

Game dies.

Oh, idiot, you just declined the EULA!

Lance (can't blame this on one of my character's personalities)
