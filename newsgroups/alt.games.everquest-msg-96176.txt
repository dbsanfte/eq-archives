Hehe, pottery bothers me even more, did the banded part of smithing in 
EFP, so vendor was 4 sec run away.

But pottery i had to run from one end of NPF to the other to get water 
and the clay. If i wanted to fire anything, i had to run to EC to get 
firing sheets (did it before Velious).
2 weeks after i reach 188 pottery (vials trivial now, and i refuse to go 
make idols), both clay and firing sheets are made stackable.
