It's pretty hard to pick a set of colors that you're guaranteed nobody
would confuse, given the extreme variety of anomalous color
perception. And it would clutter things up for people with normal
color vision, unless you deliberately had a finely tuned mottled
background like on some color tests.

6 percent of males have a degree of anomaly in their green cones, 1
percent of males have the same with their red cones, less than
1percent of females have either of the above, and an even smaller
fraction have screwed up blue cones. 
Notice the word degree. For most color deficient people, a traffic
light up close will still be discernible, they'd only mix it up if the
lights were tiny or the colors washed out (I got to see a green
defective man be tested for tiny green and red points of light, a test
they are developing to screen color vision for aviation. He'd call
green as red and red as green, green as white, red as white, white as
green, and so on.)

Yes, the only solution would be if the con colors could be
individually changed.
