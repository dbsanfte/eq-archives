I, like most Wizards, would like that Flaming Sword spell, but since it is
mostly a fun spell, no way am I paying the 7K that it goes for on my server.
There are many other spells like that, for most classes.

I wonder if anyone has considered trying some old fashioned market
manipulation to bring the price down?  It would go something like this:

1. A group of conspirators acquires two or three copies of the spell.

2. They put it for sale, just a bit lower than the current market price.
Say, maybe 6900 plat if the current price is 7k.  That's high enough that
the existing seller probably won't buy them out to get them off the market
(because the spell has low enough turnover that he's likely to be stuck with
them for a long time).

3. The 7k seller will probably lower his price to 6900 or maybe even lower.

4. Bring up another trader at 6900.  Leave things this way for a while.

5. Bring up a third trader at 6800.  Lower your other traders to match.
Wait for the original trader to match.

Continue until you've got the original trader down to something reasonable,
like 1k.
