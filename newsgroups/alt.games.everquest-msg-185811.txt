On that note, After Run...Any suggestions on what to apply from there?
I'm sure it depends alot on style and the way you play, whether you
maximize group efforts or not.

I've seen necros with 2 to 3 pets going strong and I was told that it
is a AA skill.  It would seem that that is a VERY good one to have.
He was dispatching trash in Karnor's VERY quickly with that effect...

Thanks again for all the good info.
