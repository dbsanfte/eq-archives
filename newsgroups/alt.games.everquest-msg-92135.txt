Put up or shut up.  My email address is real.  Email me and I'll give you 
a fax number so you can send your 6 figure tax return.  If you're truly 
making over $100,000/year, you would have to be an even bigger moron than 
I initially figured to whine about $40/month being greedy.
I'm willing to wager a week's salary that I paid more in taxes in 2000 
than you did.  (I would say in 2001, but I only worked 7 months.)  I don't 
hide behind a bullshit hotmail account, so I'm not likely to be spouting 
lies.  You, good sir, are both an idiot and a stereotype.  
I'll give you a hint, NOBODY who really makes $100k/year brags about 
making $1200 selling EQ accounts.
