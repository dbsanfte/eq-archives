}When you talk to that guy in Solusek Ro Temple, he mentions a wand that adds

}Is this item bugged, or is he reffering to FOCUS due to it adds +3INT?

There were no focus items when this quest was designed, so the quest 
designer probably in no way realized the wording would be misleading.

Personally, I think the Weeping Wand is a pretty good item.  My wiz has 
found it to be the item of choice on those rare occasions when she wants 
to work on 1hb. :)

}Also, he seems to give back the Bloodback Rod and says he doesnt need it.

I believe he was looking for a Bloodback Wand, off giant skellies in rathe 
mountains, but as I've never heard of a bloodback rod that's probably just 
a typo. :) Beyond that, his behaviour seems inexplicable, unless someone 
had already given him a BB Wand, but then I'd expect him just to eat the 
extra.  Hmm.

}The wand also has 2 charges of "Strip Enchantment". Is there anyway to
}charge the wand up again?

Not that I know of.
