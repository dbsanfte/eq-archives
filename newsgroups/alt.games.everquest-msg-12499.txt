As a high level necro (52 at present), let me state that I love to be
able to group with a Druid if at all possible. The Druid gives me some
nice buffs (can you say regen?), can track (with a level filter), can
snare (so I don't have to), can sell in lots and lots of zones that I
am KOS in, and on top of everything else they can Evac (just be sure
to invis first). Oh - by the way, they also can cast Harmony and only
get one mob when you would get three doing it yourself.
