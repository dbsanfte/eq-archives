Hate to tell you this, (cuz it means I'm agreeing with Kaev-but what the
hell) Depending on the shamans level the spiders in Velks resist quite a
bit.  I had that problem there myself and had a tank get pissed at me when I
quit slowing and started healing.  When I had a chanter in the group to
Tash, my slows were sticking just fine, but when he left I was in a bit of a
spot.  I can debuff too, but a lot of times if Slow is going to be resisted,
then Malosi will too.  Malosi costs 175 mana to cast and Turgers 250, of
course I could cast Turgers twice and sometimes it will stick the second
time if it's resisted the first time.  So if I cast both that's 425 mana and
I still run the risk of a resist wasting all of the mana.  On the other hand
if I switch to healing, Superior Heal does 600HP and is NEVER resisted and
only costs 250 mana (so I can get off 2 heals for a little more than the
cost of Malosi/Slow).  So in a situation with high resist rates it's logical
to switch to a different tactic to use mana efficently.  If the MOBS are
going down quickly and you have a lot of tanks slowing can be a waste of
mana especially if the MOBs have a high resist rate.

So the question I ask myself in that situation is this:  Is a non-slowed MOB
going to do more than 1200hp worth of damage before we take him down?  If
the answer is yes, then I better figure out a way to Slow it.  If not, maybe
healing is more efficient.

I also have to ask, what "useless buffs"?  Unless he was casting Charisma on
you they were probably all quite useful.  Agility is questionable, but there
are those who even swear by buffing AGI.  Using his mana to buff you up so
you hit harder, faster, proc more and resist damage seems efficient to me.

As for the shaman tanking with his pet there is absolutely nothing wrong
with that.  There are very few times I do not have a pet cast.  My pet works
like a very efficient DOT that is never resisted.  He even does enough
damage to hold aggro when I cast my nastiest DOT (to date) Envenomed Bolt.
Dog works great for crowd control during a bad pull, keeping an add busy til
we get around to him.

It's foolish to assume that you know best how any other class should be
played in all situations unless you have played that class.  The "thinking"
player adjusts his/her tactics to fit the situation. You want someone who
does the same thing all the time, no matter the setting or combination of
classes?
