Yeah, he'd need pauses.  What my enchanter and cleric do is a little
different.  On both of them my main 2 stuns are in positions 2 & 3.  My
hotbutton is simply

/cas 2
/cas 3

I mash it judiciously to get the most effect off of it...besides, I don't
want to cast both in a row a lot of the time.  There's very little gained,
for instance, in stunning a corpse. :)

Besides, I'd hate to be locked into a macro that suddenly turns into a Bad
Idea.

My macro ATTEMPTS to cast both at the same time. Obviously this isn't
possible, but it WILL cast the first one currently available.
