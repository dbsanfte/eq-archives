There are also Delux sewing kits, I am lucky because I was gifted one before
they were removed from the game.  they are also 10slot, I use mine just like
a pack.  They do not drop anywhere anymore so you will need to use a loom or
search the bazaar for the delux kit.  Not sure if you will find anyone
willing to sell though.

Good luck.
