Necros use words not runes.  Look at casters realm www.castersrealm.com
under necromancer and choose research.  There is a complete list of every
spell that must be researched and the words used for it.  Also, at the same
site if you check out the part about necro spells it will tell you when you
click on the chosen spell where to buy it, or if it needs to be researched
and the words needed.
