Remap.

That is the fix. Alt O and go to keyboard and move some stuff around.
My auto run is 0 Ins on the numpad, since it is by the 4 cursor keys,
to the left of it.

So my autorun did not change at all. Stopping auto run changed,
though, which is hard to get used to. Always before I'd just hit the
UP arrow key to stop autorunning, without thinking about it. After a
recent patch that no longer works so I'm trying to get used to hitting
the DOWN arrow key to stop.

Chat stuff changed too, so I made shift up/down arrows the way to
navigate the chat window.
