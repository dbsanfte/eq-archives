As a 33 cleric, I don't see this change as an entirely bad thing. For a
start, it means that the various ways of getting a healing bonus once
again become meaningful. Looking at the AA skills, I was
wondering "what's the use of a healing bonus when I'll have
CHeal by then?"

With healing and specialisation bonuses, the total will still be
around 10K as I figure it.

It *is* annoying that the best Cleric Heal is being nerfed at about the
same time that the other priest classes get their heals *upgraded*.
Druids and such get lots of other neat spells to make life interesting.
Clerics are pretty much specialist healers and rezzers; if Verant
keeps toning down that role, soon there won't be any reason
to play the class. We could at least get some nice extra
(snare? SoW?) to compensate. :-)
