You probably are not going to get the belt soloing in FG at level 55.  I did
get lucky and get one once while I was there, but I was with a group 56-60.
The belt is quite a rare drop also, so you will need to kill a bunch of the
mobs to get one.  Just can't recall now which one dropped it, I think one of
the Dreggs.
