I'm not going to flame your answer (I dislike the trivial loot code as well)
but I am going to flame your grammar. Infinitives should not be split and
proper place names should be capitalized. Thus, you should have written that
you would like not to see trivial loot code on Luclin. That you would not like
to see trivial loot code would have been acceptable as well.
