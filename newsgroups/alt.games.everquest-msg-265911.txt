You have missed the point.  The only _Official_ definition is someone
who can get no experience - that's the only form of "kill stealing"
that's in the rules.

And that was 42 talking about how people behave in EQ.

Bingo.  It's politeness, nothing more, to not attack something that's
already being fought.

Oh I know, I've been reading the forums daily since may 6th.
That's where the less than 5% figure came from - the devs noting that
all the squeaky wheels in the forums made up a small portion of the
total players.
The other thing you've probably noticed, is that most of the loudest
whiners repeat their posts over and over again with different titles.

Exactly - it's a once in a blue moon activity.

Bingo - i've done the same on /en blasters that had the first secondary
power on auto to knock back anything that got to melee.
I've even gone so far to make sure not to target mobs, but forgot about
the assist rule, so targeting the player instead had your auto assist
him.

I thought so, since I have exactly no desire to play a game that
_requires_ camping spawns, rare items to be able to compete, people
claiming entire zones as their personal hunting grounds, and has such a
problem with kill stealing that the players _had_ to come up with
elaborate conventions to deal with it.
