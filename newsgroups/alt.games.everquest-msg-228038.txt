I think it was only randomized by an hour or two at most though. This
new way with them all spawning at once, any time between 1-20 hours
could actually be better. However, at least on our server, I can see the
some guilds actually camping the entrance and waiting. We're talking
guilds who actually did crowd control on the emporer room for 5 hours
one day waiting for blood to spawn to establish their right to the
spawn.
