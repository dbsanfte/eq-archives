I didn't think there was going to be a rapture, but it seems reasonable that
will happen in 3.5 years where the church will be removed from the earth and
the only solace from the darkness will be reason and Satan and his chief
disciple will finally have his day in the light and will actively enslave
people who follow him and destroy those who don't with no mercy whatsoever.
If you do not follow Satan and bear his mark then you will not be able to
participate in the economy either making money or spending it, you will be
driven into hiding to fend for yourself in the wilderness where the greatest
hidden wisdoms and the most unlikely of allies can be found and you will
bind together and raze the earth or be destroyed as God's laws will no
longer apply to you anymore, the holy spirit will be gone, the church will
gone, the only thing you will have left are the words I am writing now and
any other words or instructions which are written and the 1611 King James
version of the Bible a copy of which can be found hidden in my bedroom along
with a picture of the antichrist so you will know I was right and will find
nothing but despair and pain in your heart and a long, and perilous road
which will lie before you, but you may experience true freedom for the first
time as those who refuse to live in Satan's kingdom can create their own
kingdom.
