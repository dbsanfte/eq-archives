Wash your mouth out.  Backward compatibility in the AGA chipset is
what delayed it too long to take advantage of the tremendous technological
lead the Amiga had.  They basically implemented two chips in one
so that old games and "demos" that hit the hardware directly, rather
than using the API's, had a backwards compatibility mode.  Of course,
you had to reboot into it, then back to AGA.  Had they followed
through on their original statement that they couldn't guarantee
register level compatibility between the chips, they would have been
able to progressively upgrade the chipset much faster.  Yes, a lot
of games and demos would have broken the first time - but not thereafter.

By comparison, imagine the 3d world today without a unified 3d
API (or 2).  Do you remember the fractured video hardware scene
just prior to DX?  You probably didn't have to write your graphics
routines to deal with multiple implementations of something as
simple as an 8bit pallettized display.  Even with DX2 you had to
deal with a number of oddities.  

I developed a series of graphics objects in Delphi/DX2 that did
alpha blended, rotated, scaled blits of 8 bit RLE encoded images to
a 16bit screen (then the rapid advance of DX and the hardware
under it made them obsolete - with a 3d accelerator in place
you just render a quadrangle with your image as the texture
and you get the accelerator to do the rotation, scaling and
blending for you.)

At the core were some hand coded assembler routines to do
the actual legwork - and they had to be replicated 3 ways:
1 - for 5-5-5 RGB encoding (with the last bit ignored)
2 - for 5-5-5 BGR encoding (yes there were some cards that
    did this
3 - for 5-6-5 RGB encoding (the human eye is more sensitive
    to green, hence some cards boosted the bit depth of green)

And those were easy compared to what preceded it.  

No - The amiga developers were way ahead of their time in
software and hardware (accelerated graphics) and they had
the right idea (forcing people away from the hardware and
through the API) and lacked the drive to stick to it.
