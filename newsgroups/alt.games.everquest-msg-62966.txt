Well, this just *doesn't* make sense... I use the same ISP and # and my
connection is fine. I find it odd that 4 different people would suddenly
develop connection problems at the same time.

They're all hardware ISA modems, so a change in allocated memory would have
to be pretty drastic to affect the modem, especially *outside* of the game.

The slow throughput on the cable modem system *really* has me bugged as it's
still running slick as all hell as far as the rest of the LAN is concerned.

THIS IS WIERD!
