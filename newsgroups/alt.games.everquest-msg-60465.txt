Actually that is a very invalid comparison. A valid comparison would
be if your brother always ate at a particular restaurant and was a
continual customer from month to month and suddenly everytime he went
in the resaurant they started asking him questions about possible
stomach problems or his shoe size or something and he refused to
answer but they kept asking him anyway.

He is at the restaurant paying for a service and the service is food.
He is not at the restaurant paying for the service to help them with
market research. Of course in the case of the restaurant if he said
"stop asking me that I'm not going to answer," they likely would.

You seem to not really understand the concept of "customer."

I give erroneous info when people pester me with surveys on the
internet or in real life also.
