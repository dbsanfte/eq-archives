I think Legend of Mir may end up with a good system. I'm not sure of
the details and the game is in beta, but basically...

Anyone can PvP at any time, but you become labeled a PvP'er. PvP'ers
are KOS to the gaurds and killing a PvP'er doesn't make you a PvP'er.
I think you eventually lose your PvP status based on how much you've
PvP'ed.

So grief players become targets since killing them is not considered
PvP. And if you only occasionally PvP (like beggars or KS'ers or just
someone you don't like :-) you will only be flagged PvP for a short
period.
