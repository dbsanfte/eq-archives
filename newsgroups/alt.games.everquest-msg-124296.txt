I've been very happy hunting in CC in the early 30s, at 35 every orc seems
to be dark blue and readily charmable, and plentiful enough to always find
at least two.  One at a time they can be a little annoying, but they are
perfect
charm fodder.  At the same time, with a group your multifunction services as
puller, mezzer, snarer, slower, haster, regen and mana supply all rock any
group in there from the high 20s (where they are your support crew) to
low 50s (where you are the support and suck up all the exp off their mostly
green farming)

While EW, GD, FM, and so forth work, they involve more running around
looking for mobs, and don't have the hefty exp bonus that dungeons do.

Also, CC is filled with miners that drop velium, which sells to other players
for a small but substantial fortune, and velium weapons to sell to vendors,
along with a handy set of guards, vendor ( need to use faction song probably)
and banker.  For groups you also have Terrors, Geonids, and Spiders,
all of which are probably over your head solo but quite in range of groups
given your substantial potential level range.
