> As for your crusade against IE *yawn*

Yep, i hate IE, and use NS, but that dont make me block my site from being viewed by other (ok, maybe
WebTV, but doubt anyone will complain about that)

I prefer to have both IE and NS installed. I prefer NS, but it IS unstable like hell (use 4.7x, tried
6.x, deleted it as fast as i could), and there ARE sites that cannot be viewed in it. For that you have
to use IE.
In 99% of the cases its either because it use something NS 4.7 cant handle, or because its sloppy HTML
work (Hey, THE danish auction site forgot to end their index file properly, used <frameset> instead of
</frameset>, and the jerks only test with IE, so the site could only be viewed in IE in 1 week. They
only noticed it because i got tired of having to use a bookmarked subpage on the site to get in, and
mailed them about the problem).

But on the other hand, who cares that much. First of all you make a site that dont work in IE, then you
scare the rest of the possible readers away with popup banners, surefire way to make sure noone will
ever see your site.
