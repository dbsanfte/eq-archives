Elemental Mobs.......OMG Yes at 30......get a port into Twilight Sea.  The
island you port into is FULL of elemental mobs.  You start off non-KOS to
them but as you kill them your faction will go down with them and up with
the guy who lives in the tower there.  Pull the fire elementals with Cancel
Magic and they drop very fast.  There is a cycle there as you kill
elementals of one type a larger will spawn all the way up to Hydro, Terra,
Aqua, and ?Fiero?.  Each of the larger ones has the chance of dropping some
pretty decent loot, including the Fetish of the Agile (4k item to players,
give or take).  Elementals of the same type will assist each other but not
assist dissimilar elementals.  Oddly some of the items that drop are No Drop
but the vendor in the tower will still purchase them.

If you're really brave, invis and run through Fungus Grove to TS, just
follow the left wall.
