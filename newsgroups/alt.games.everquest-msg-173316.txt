For those who know them on the Raith server... Veshoon and Sevarian are
deployed on the Harry S Truman.  Galimon is on the Teddy Roosevelt,  Smalle
is on an LHD, and Kuric is on a DDG (I think).  I'm still on the Reagan, so
there's not much chance of me deploying soon (my request to transfer back to
the HST was shot down).
