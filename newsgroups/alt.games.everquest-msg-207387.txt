Yes but there still is no quest for them, that change to CC was made a while
ago.
With 400,000+ people playing this game all quests have been found by now.
If they haven't its because they are broken or not fully implemented.
The scalps probably were for a quest but it was removed for some reason and
they just never removed the scalps from the drop table.

Best you can do is /feedback it and tell them to remove them or add a quest
for
them, and make them stack while they are at it. I did.
