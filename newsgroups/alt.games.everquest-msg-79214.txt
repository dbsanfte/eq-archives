"Low" versus "High" in any color is just based on past experience with those
critters.   If you killed a white critter and then dinged you now know what
is a high blue...that ex-white critter.  The blue stuff last level that's
still blue this level are a lower blue.

A "low red" is one that your spells stick to, as an added example.
