Because the other priests don't need mana regen do they! /glare

Im really curious here... but where and why did you get it into you're mind
that the other wis casters have no right asking on such a shield?

Shamans buff a damn sight more than you, they debuff, they slow, they heal..
these things are CRITICAL on raids.
Do emp without a shaman, tell me if you have any problems :)

Druids..  they debuff (albeit not such a crucial manner), they spam heals
(you do realise you're cheal chain isn't solely keeping you're tank up,
right?!), nuke, and buff

Tell me why those utilities don't enable them to ask for FT loot?
