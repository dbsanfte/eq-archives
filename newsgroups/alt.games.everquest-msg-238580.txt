: the other day, i realized that one of the things that greatly impressed me

: it's something that anyone can go and try out, and i reckon, will enjoy

: then i got to thinking that other people must have similar duplicable
: moments that are worth trying out

When the damage cap on my warrior dropped and I hit for (gasp!) 24 with a
Fine Steel 2H, then at level 30 when I hit for a crit of 102 for the first
time... All I could say was, "Damn.  That feels good."

Laughing when I gave my Shaman pet a dagger and seeing the "Jobober pierces
XXX for 18" message.

Most recently, using my Berserker's Leg Chop ability, "A Giant Snake's legs
buckle"... And fighting in Crushbone, collecting belts and pads, and getting
real exp for the quests, as well as decent coin for that level.
