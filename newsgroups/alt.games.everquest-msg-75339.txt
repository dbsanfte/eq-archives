Well, i do earn most of my money on loot/tradeskills, and have never 
spend days only doing ports, but i have seen NO decrease in people 
asking for ports.
Usually when i port someone, its from freeport, the nearest Nexus port 
are in NK. Noone wanna do that long run.

And those ports can only get you to those few wiz spires, no port to EJ, 
CS and the like. If you wanna get from NK to EJ you dont take Luclin 
port (not 15 min, can be up to 37 min for each port lats time i timed, 
never seen it only take 15 min), take port down to LD, run through half 
of Kunark to get to EJ. So no suffers there.

People still beg for ports all the time, ask for ports in NFP all the 
time and so on, just as before the ports.

The ONLY thing that bothers me about the ports is that i have to sit and 
wait thos 1-37 min to get to Luclin, and cant port around on Luclin.
