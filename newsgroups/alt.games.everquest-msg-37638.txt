I tell you, I am a long time lurker who doesn't post much but your sig is more
offensive then anything that guy wrote. No, not the fighting Cancer bit, but
your anti-Homosexual attitude. Why don't you take your uneducated, redneck
hillbilly arch-conservative stance and at least say something original?!?!?!
That "joke" has been around since the antediluvian period, and it STILL isn't
funny. So, in conclusion, sod off and die, homophobe.
