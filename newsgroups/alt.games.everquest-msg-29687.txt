Win2k was fine here. Post Velious I was playing EQ on
my Win2K machine with an AMD 1100 & GF3 video card.
No problems at all and smooth as glass. These pauses
were an issue for most everyone at one point but it was
fixed in a patch a while back . I suppose it may have
resurfaced again in another patch but I wouldn't know
because...

Right now I can't even log in . All I see is a "you have
been disconnected" at the char select screen or soon after.
I've been as far as the "Entering Norrath" message but nothing
past that for the last month.  My cable Co. is in the process
of changing over to DOCSIS modems and everything is hosed
right now.
