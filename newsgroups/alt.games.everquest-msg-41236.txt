Human brains are pretty good at pattern matching a real event to some
jibberish.
They are good at extracting signal out of noise, even when there's no
signal!
It makes one up.

Some things to think about:

This is the second year of the new millennium (though nit pickers might call
it the first year), rather than just a new century.  When
he wrote of "the new century", he probably meant 1700.  If he meant new
millennium, why didn't he say it?

Since when did anyone call New York "The City of God".  Wouldn't that
more likely be Jerusalem?

New York is at 41 degrees North Lattitude, not 45 degrees.  If you say
"well, it's within a four degrees"  there are a ton of large cities within a
four
degrees of 45N.
At what point do you call it "not a match".  Why didn't Nostradamus say
"40 degrees" if he were rounding?

Fire didn't "approach the city".  Metaphorically, you could call the jets
approaching
the buildings as fire, but that's a stretch.

The sky didn't burn.  It was in the buildings.  The city isn't burning
anymore.

I've never heard of the twin towers as being referred to as the two
brothers.
Why didn't Nostradamus refer to them as the Twin Brothers?  That would have
matched better.

Which great leader will succumb?  Bush shows no signs of it, and I'd hardly
call him a great leader.

Are you sure this is an accurate translation from the original French?  Can
you
cite the original?

Are there other events in history that match this verse?  You may have to do
some research on that one.

Could you have predicted what happened, when and where from that verse?
I think not.  So what good is it?

Personally, I think we're much better off looking at the real threats that
have been made.  Three weeks ago, followers of Bin Laden said that
there would be a large, unprecedented attack against the U.S.  They
tried to attack those buildings once before, so they are likely targets
again.  Yousef (the 1996 (?) bomber) said it was their intention to knock
one building into the other causing them both to collapse.
