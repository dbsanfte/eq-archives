Not a bad weapon.

> Secondary Melee: Crested Mistmoore Shield

I would suggest you take a trip to Sol A and camp yourself a Charred
Guardian Shield, 9 WIS.

> Ranged Weapon:   Preserved Split Paw Eye

If you can find a friend to help you camp Granchist in Warsilik's Woods, you
can get a Totem of Warrior Spirit, which is 3 WIS 3 STR, and if you're
really lucky, he'll drop Shrunken Goblin Skull Earring, which you can sell
for 5k an finance even better gear.

> Ear:                          Forest Loop

If you can get your WIS to 200 without earrings, I'd suggest depending on
your STR, getting either Orc Fang Ears, or Mana ears.

> Neck:                       Black Alloy Medallion

If you have a diety symbol I'd use that instead.

> Face:                       Silver Ruby Veil

Platinum ones are getting cheaper, you should be able to get one for a few
hundred pp.

> Head:                      Foreman's Skull Cap

Again, depending on WIS, I would use a Skull Shaped Barbute, 35 extra HP,
and 10 MR, as well as AC

> Shoulder:                Tattered Mantle

Get into a group in Lower Guk that's pulling the Cavalier and get some
adamantite epolets.

> Finger:                     Silver Jasper Ring
> Finger:                     Silver Jasper Ring

Depending on WIS you might like some HP rings.

> Wrist:                       Ulthork Hide Bracer
> Wrist:                       Bronze Bracers

Do the cleric bracer quests, you won't regret it.

> Arm:                         Fine Plate Vambraces

The quest stuff is better.

> Chest:                      Bloodstained Tunic

Again, depending on WIS, I'd go for quest BP

> Back:                       Kunzar Cloak

You might be able to camp a mamy cloak in Everfrost.

> Feet:                        Bronze Boots
> Legs:                       Fine Plate Greaves

Do the quests.

> Waist:                     Crystalline Belt
> Hands:                    Split Paw Hide Gloves

If you can get into a group in the Rygorr area, you can come away with a
pair of Gauntlets of the black.
