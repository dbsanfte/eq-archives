Wrong.  And no, I'm not a newbie either; I've been playing as long as you
have.

Buffbot is the common name for a 2-boxed character you're hauling along to
provide buffage and other support for your group.  Hell, you should know

2-boxing is running 2 characters.  If one is simply being brought along to
provide support, he's a buffbot.
