As a young Druid, I spent many a merry hour kicking butt on Jracol
Brestiage in the yard of North Qeynos.  Good cheap expy, very little
risk of harm and he was blue for so many levels.  How could a yound
druid boy say no?

Well, the consequences of my youthful indiscretions are that I am
extremely unpopular high Highpass.  We're not talking "dubious".
We're not talking "ready to attack".  We're talking one glimpse and
every guard descends upon me.  It's great to be popular and all, but
it really is making it ... complicated ... to play in that zone.

So, does anyone have some useful suggestions on how to fix my faction
so I can walk around in Highpass without become guard bait?  I'm open
to rapid fixes as well as laboriously dull efforts, like killing
bandits. Yawn.

Bill
