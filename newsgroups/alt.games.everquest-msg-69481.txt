Companies love subscribers, even when they don't make a profit. Each
subscriber is worth about $300 or more on paper, which is about $108
million. Even if they lose millions each year, they can just sell us during
a slow quarter to give their stock a boost. Sony can't lose!

SO, you'd have to asume the development budget is in the millions! This
gives you a team of about 24 for the year. Support is actually run by a
separate division, so you don't even have to include that in your budget!

Given that, how can you say Verant programmers DON'T suck?
