Emotional garbage which isn't even close to anything I ever said.
Cheap attempt to score a point.

Nice snipping.  "more-or-less" seems somehow to have disappeared from
in front of "united single human society" in my original quote.
Wonder how that happened?

And you conveniently omit the part where I mentioned the neutrals.  Do
you always argue by attempting to drastically distort what your
opponent says?

And "ganged up"?  You are claiming Germany as a *victim* here?

Plurality, not majority.  The *majority* of the world will tell any
Christian who tells them that to go to hell himself.

See above.  Further, the majority of the world, in my opinion,
believes in tolerance of others' religions and viewpoints.  Including
Islam.  Al-Qaeda is a very, very small faction.

Of course we can.  If, as we seem to be in agreement on, morality is a
human invention, then an act is or is not moral depending on whether
the majority of humanity thinks it is or isn't.

The majority of humanity probably has no opinion whatsoever on the
wearing of burqas, or the taking of the sacrament, or any of a host of
other things that could be thrown up to cloud the issue.  These things
are therefore morally neutral from a world viewpoint, no matter how
the adherents of a particular religion may feel about them.

I would maintain, however, that the taking of thousands of innocent
lives is something that the world feels very strongly about indeed.
