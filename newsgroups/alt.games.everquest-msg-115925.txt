Note that EQ has announced that now that the quest has been completed,
it will be much easier to get the scroll... whatever that means,
presumably
vendor buyable or a much shortened quest.  They also say the quest
will be left in place for those who like doing quests, and for the
fairly
nice rewards other than the scroll.

This is a new twist on "dynamic content" a quest that has to be done
only once, by someone on one of the many servers, and then its
rewards are available for all.  Sort of like waking the sleeper only
-good- instead of -incredibly lame-
