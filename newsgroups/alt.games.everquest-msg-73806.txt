Subject: Beastlord-wearable armor and shields?

Can anyone tell me what some of the magical armors and shields that Beastlords
can use are?

I'd like to get some new armor for my Barbarian Beastlord so he doesn't look
like a male version of Xena, if you know what I mean, but don't know magical
Norrath armor what they can wear. (I already have a list of the Luclin armors
they can wear)

And I don't know what its called, but can Barbarians wear the helmet that looks
like a polar bear head, or Wu's Fighting Armor? Someone told me they could wear
the Wu's leggings, but I haven't had anyone confirm this.
