I'm pretty new to EQ and have some questions about critical hits.

Which classes get critical hits and for which weapon types?

How is the damage calculated?

At a very low level (around 17) it looks to me like a warrior's critical hit
with a 1HS weapon does roughly the same damage as a rogue's backstab.  I
know that rogues are considered the serious damage dealers in EQ.  Would
someone please clarify this for me.

Thanks
