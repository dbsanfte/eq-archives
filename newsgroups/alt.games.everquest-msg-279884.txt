Because Sony has provided so much variety, and simply so much, in
single-group encounters that if you consider it tedious (and *I* do, thus
why I much prefer raiding to single-groups), there is really very little
they can do about that.

You want better rewards...  you want better toys.  Everybody does, it's part
of the game.  But putting better rewards into single-group encounters does
nothing to alleviate the tedium.  I reference the fact that I have DoN augs
because they were quick to acquire rather than spending the time necessary
grinding in RS to have a full set of better augs.

Nope.  Getting the better augments and items out of single-group OoW and GoD
encounters should be better.  =)
