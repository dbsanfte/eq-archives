I imagine they're charmable with the higher level charms although
I've never tried. They're certainly root/mezzable, and they do not
cast. All warriors, I think as I dont recall ever seeing one backstab
or feign death ;) ;)

Talendor shouldnt pose too much trouble for you provided you bring the
numbers, he's basically nagafen. Trakanon is a matter of having huge
poison resist, a mage set up to bring your MA back from being trak
touched (you'll find out... ;) ) and killing him before he kills
you. His AE is mean and it sounds like you're a way away from being able
to do tricks like MGB ae heals....
