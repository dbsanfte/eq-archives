Right.  Basically, if X is Y's sidekick, X's effective level is boosted to
near Y's.  I don't believe X gets more HP, so X is still pretty weak, but
his to-hit chances are boosted, so that he can hit the bad guys, and he
casts his spells as if he were really the boosted level.  This boost for
spells works well in CoH because in that game, you keep using your early
spells all through your career.  It's not like EQ where you get higher level
spells that tend to replace the lower level spells (e.g., in EQ, my 61
Wizard casting the level 1 nuke will do exactly as much damage as a level 4
Wizard casting the level 1 nuke, whereas in CoH, a level 40 casting the
first nuke in a given line would do way more damage than a level 4 casting
that same nuke).

I believe XP is also split as if you are at the boosted level, and then
scaled back.  So, if you are a sidekick in a high level group fighting stuff
that is an even con to the group, you'd get about as much XP as if you were
in a group of your level fighting stuff that is an even con to that group.

They also have something that is kind of the opposite of sidekicks, I
believe.  Instead of X getting boosted to near Y's level, Y can get dropped
down near X's level.  So, your high level friend can join you and help you
on your low level mission this way.

I don't recall the details, but Mythic borrowed this idea from CoH and added
something similar to DAoC.  I don't think you actually become a sidekick
there, but rather, I *think* it is automatic if you have someone in the
group who is below the normal grouping limits.  So, basically, they get the
boosted to-hit.  DAoC spells are more like EQ1 spells, so I don't think
casters would benefit as much as they do under the CoH system, but it works
for melee, and I'd guess it works reasonably for healing classes.
