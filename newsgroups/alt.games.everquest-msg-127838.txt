I saw this a lot in Misty Thicket, when I had my Shaman from my first
account helping my various Halfling newbies on my second account.  Since my
Shaman was not very high level (only 10), I tended to keep him out of the
way, up on the zone wall, where nothing would attack him while my Halflings
were out fighting.  The Halflings would run back to the Shaman when they
needed rebuffing or healing.  Quite often, when running back to where I'd
left the Shaman, the Halflings could not see him...but from the other
computer, the Shaman had no trouble seeing the Halflings run up.

Similarly, in Nektulos, when my Wizard on my first account was mid-30's, and
did not have jboots, I had a level 9 Shaman from my second account standing
around the hills next to the wizard pyramid.  When my Wizard needed a SOW,
I'd just port in, run over to the Shaman for the SOW, and gate back to where
I was fighting.  Just like in Misty, the characters often had trouble seeing
each other.

It's purely a client display bug.  I've had the chance to run both my
accounts on a LAN where someone else was running ShowEQ, and ShowEQ showed
that the server was sending the right positions to the client.  The client
just seems to get confused by height differences, and botches the visibility
calculation.
