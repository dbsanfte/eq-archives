Why on earth would the necros slow themselves down like that?  I play a
shaman, and, well, given the way necros kill things, I am seeing very little
point to having shaman there too.  Enchanter?  For what?  Mana regen?  We
are talking necros here.  Cleric?  Well, if you dump the shaman and the
enchanter, there really isn't much need for a cleric anymore.
