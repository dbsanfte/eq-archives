The heal dropped from one of the vxed trash mobs. You know how vxed works,
you pull to the first platform for about 75-80 kills and then start marching
NE toward the NPC room for the final hail. If you've got a pooka charmed in
particular it's a lot easier to manage it at that first plaform than having
to move it up those narrow passageways with their constant repops. It was
during one of those pulls to the first platform and I honestly don't
remember if it was a stonemite, hynid, noc, whatever, no recollection, but
just one of those trash mobs. All I remember was seeing that spell being
looted and I hadn't even yet scribed Balance of the Nihil...

Because of the recent patching, I don't think Magelo Update has been able to
keep up with current versions -- my GoD-augmented Cap of the Drowned Souls
doesn't shows up yet either -- so I think that AA list is out of date. My
plan has been to enable those things which would most benefit my groups in
my most frequent scenarios. In my mind that meant MGB, as much buffing
enhancement as I could gain (at 65% Extended now), as much mana preservation
as possible (aye, SCM has to be a priority for me), hit points of course
(ND3) and defensives (I'm currently CS3, CA3, LR5 and ID4 working on ID5).
I'm a fairly young shaman with only 128 AA's so I'm still building a
foundation here.

I'm eager to try some of the others and I will be going for the healing line
next, but the truth is I am rarely called on to provide healing in raids. In
groups I backup the CLR and often am 3rd in line behind the CLR/DRU, but
it's important enough that I do want to maximize it, particularly now that
I've got the new spell that can result in 3000+ hp crit heals. I do realize
that Shaman are fine healers, I can MH any LDoN, BoT or HoH group just fine.
However, I don't really go to those places anymore. When I'm not raiding,
I'm in Gates of Discord where the mobs are routinely hitting me and everyone
else 1000-2500 a swing and I just don't have the chops to do much more than
patch a life-saving 5-10% interim heal while the main heals are incoming.
Any enhancement I can do to that, however, is worth working on but it came
out as the next priority on my list after the above.

I've heard very good things about VP and also plan to try that one out as an
alternative (or perhaps a prelude?) to root parking. The one I really have
mixed feelings about is SCS, I'm wondering if I'll even be able to root park
anymore if I get that. Thoughts?

Thanks!
