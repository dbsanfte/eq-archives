Yeap.  Almost guaranteed not to matter, given how little impact it has on 
the world outside of EQ...

Funny you should say that.  That comparison test I was referring to... 
they found someone masochistic enough to do 10,244 trivial combines of 
scorpion meat sandwiches...

Theyre also working on determining exactly how random (or unrandom) the 
famous streaky RNG is.

}Nice to know aproximatly what your chances are for non trival combines,
}but once you get past the "I have a one in three chance of making that
}250 triv item" it kind of becomes meaning less, IMOSHO.

Yeap, 16% difference could be the difference between 1 in 3 and 1 in 6, 
though.

}However I would never want to discourage the anal qualities of the
}tradeskilling community, afterall thats the only way that us mortals
}find out about new recipies etc.

Heh, yeup. :)
