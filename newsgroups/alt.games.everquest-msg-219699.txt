In UO's defence, that doesn't exist anymore. They've split the world
into two 'facets', or dimensions. One is old style, where you can be
PKed and PK to your hearts content, and the other is new style, in
which you actually need to give consent before any other player can
harm you (granted, after 40 hours of game time, any dangerous animals
can kill you, however players can't)
