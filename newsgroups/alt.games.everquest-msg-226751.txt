Considering they have those magus guys sitting around, the best idea, all
around would be to go back to the old days of everyone sitting around in EC.
You could pull together a group there, then port over to the zone in which
you want to do the dungeon.  This would put everyone in the same area, so
you've got more people to choose from.  I doubt that will ever happen,
though... I can't even convince people to put up the damn <lfg> tag.

Then you get started with the guy who joined not five minutes ago saying
"Oops, I've got to go, dinner."  WTF????  And what would you have done if we
were in the dungeon, left us high and dry?  I pulled together a group that
once had fourteen members before we ever actually got the adventure.

That doesn't bother me.  I understand their time is valuable to the, so I
can accept if they don't want to sit around waiting another hour for a
group.  Hell, -I- don't want to sit around for another hour looking for a
group.  That's one reason my paladin soloed almost the entire span of 30 to
51.

Hell, I'll join any group that can take me.  Even if we don't win, I can get
decent XP from it (for my 31 bard).
