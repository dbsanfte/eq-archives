I know where the water under the bridge is in Felwithe. Does that also
include the spot over near the tunnel, where the baitshop is? I noticed a
nice slanty area there. Both my enchanter and my mage are in Commons just
now, but it wouldn't be a big deal to run them over there. In fact, I think
all my girls are over somewhere either in Commonlands or in Freeport. I need
to run Darklet over to get a friend in Halas who wants to go to Misty and
isn't sure of the way. (she's pretty low level as well) I could always swim
where the boat goes. I did that, actually, with my Barbarian once or twice.
Never been to Surefall, but I guess I'll be going through it on my way to
Halas. I didn't realize that the crocs didn't aggro, that's even closer to
my casters than running back to Felwithe.

thanks!
Darklet
