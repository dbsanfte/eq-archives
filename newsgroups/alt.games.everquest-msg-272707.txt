Hmm. No, I've seen people on tv get arrested and taken to jail for
various reasons. They may or may not have been breaking a law. In
some instances its alleged they broke a law, the case is later
dropped because of mistaken identity or any of a number of other
reasons. But they spent time in jail anyway.

But as for SOE, I feel that if someone is simply complaining about
something SOE did or didn't do, thats no justification for banning
someone. And if thats all he did, make a valid complaint, then all
SOE accomplished was make themselves look moronic. And I feel that
if they banned someone for making a valid complaint, they should
spend some time in jail. Its my personal take on certain idiocies
pretending to be a business policy.
