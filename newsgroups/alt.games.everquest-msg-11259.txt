My guess is they have some formula to determine the price and then they
truncate the value
to show the single price.  When they do the 20 price, they multiply the
price before
truncation.  For example, maybe the single item price is really 10.5 coppers
and
they just throw away the .5 copper.  But when you get 20 items, they charge
you
for 20 * 10.5 = 210 coppers.

One thing I can't figure out though is that they don't make the same error
when selling
the item.  For example, water costs 1 silver but a stack is 2g1s.  With good
faction,  the price
he offers me to buy back the water is 1 silver. But if  I sell a stack of
20 waters, he only gives
me 2 gold.  Must calculate the price in two different places since I would
have expected him
to give me 2g1s like when I bought them.
