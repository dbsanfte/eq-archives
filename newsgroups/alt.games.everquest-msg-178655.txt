OK this thread really shows the laziness of new players, who fall into
that," I can't wait , POP tome Crap".
You want your body back?you did say you knew where it was in Rathe,
right.You say your in Oasis or S. Ro ,right? well do this then:

1) if you don't know the zones get your ass over to EQ Atlas and get
the maps you'll need.

2) Get your lazy ass running ( with or without SOW ) back to Rathe and
get your corpse.

End of story.

In the time it took you to post this thread you could have gotten your
corpse back.
Damn, Oasis to Rathe is nothing.Whats that like 3 zones?
How many of us here remember running across 10 zones to get our corpse
back or how about running from FP to Thurg because you got killed on
the way out of the dragon tooth ring going to Thurg.

How many of you newbie even know what the Dragon tooth ring is.
Ahh the good old days.....LOL
