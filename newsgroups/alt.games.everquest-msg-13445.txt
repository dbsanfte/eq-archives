Oh, I usually laugh when I try usual tactics and it suddenly has a much
different affect than usual...getting me killed in that split second.

Tip: Don't tashan anything in Icewell until it's at least 10% down.  I've
found that to be true a lot more places now that I'm 50+.

Heck, the other day a rogue and a warrior were beating on that bug in SolB
that drops the BCLs (death beetle?  I forget) over in a doorway...badly
placed.

To get his attention after he was down to about 30% health I cast nothing
but tashan on him.  On the fourth cast he came running for me and into a
nice place for him to die.

Tashan doesn't do any damage and doesn't really noticeably affect a
critter's chance of survival.  It lowers magic resist so the reasoning is
that more magic-based nukes will hit with max damage.  I still cast it most
of the time but I honestly am not sure why I bother.
