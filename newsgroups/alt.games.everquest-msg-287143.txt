I'm confused -- wasn't it always the case that the shaman epic was
based purely off of faction? That it used to be only a shaman could MQ
to another shaman because of the ever-precious truespirit faction?

But yes, sony sucks, eq was dumbed down, it rocked back in the day,
and wow is stupid. But that mantra is meaningless to me now, i tool
around on eq2 and enjoy it because of the improved aesthetic over eq1
and i don't really mind the lame mechanics. I'm not really a gamer at
heart, i'm a dreamer.

Oh, and i got a vanity license plate for my motorcycle reading "Faza"
so ... it's sort of like i'm playing eq again.
