Heh, well, maybe not.  =)  In fact, price inflation is creating more
customers for them from people who feel they have no choice but to buy plat
in order to purchase nice stuff.

I just lament over the fact that the 200Kpp that I worked very hard for -
basically took three months off from grouping ot become a GM smith - is not
worth nearly as much as it used to be.  And it's almost entirely because of
these "caring" plat sellers.
