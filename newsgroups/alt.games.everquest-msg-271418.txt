Speaking for myself, after experiencing how SOE took the originally quite
fun EQ1, and turned it into a pile of rancid feces, I would just as soon
lance out my own eyeballs with hot needles before playing EQ2.

Plus, the coders at SOE wouldn't know optimization if it carved its name in
their chests with a chainsaw dipped in vinegar. It is really quite amazing
how you can get framerate lag in their games even when you exceed minimum
specs by 5x, and have video options turned way way down, and nobody but you
onscreen. Yes, it really is that bad.
