Another of those memories that'll live for a long time....

About 2 years ago I remember wanting to take my 5 gno mag from Ak'Anon to
Qeynos to meet my best friend who decided a human warrior in Qeynos was the
way to go.  This is, of course, before 90% of players think teleports are a
RIGHT.  Actually, this was before I even knew it was a possibility (only a
handful of druids or wizards would have been level 29 at the time).

So off I go.  Through LFay, GFay, BB, wait for the one boat that made the
trip to FP.   This is also before I had any map besides the most basic
zone-connection map from Allakhazam.  Before I (or many people) knew how to
use /loc.

FP to EC to WC following paths.  Along the path in WC I give wide berth to
an HG and run close to a griff.  It didn't attack me for some reason. *whew*
In Kith (pre-nightmares) actually lucked out and kept to the right paths to
Highpass.

In Highpass I saw high level players in the zone (level 19-21!!!) and asked
if it was a safe zone for a level 5.   I was told no (and right there at the
zone, they were killing big orcs!  Wow!).  I finally talked someone into
binding and invising me so that if I died I wouldn't have that far to go.  I
somehow made it through Highpass with little difficulty (I still hate that
zone 'cause I can never find anything).

I saw the ramp in EK.  OMG!!!  My pulse was racing all the way down the
damned thing.

I get to the bottom and look to my left and see a hill giant!  Ack!  He was
only about 500' away from me!
To my right up comes a cat. Cool...I'm a cat person (all my characters have
started on Faydwer where there are VERY few cats).  It's a lioness matriarch
and kills me quickly.

So I beg another invis and make it through Highpass with little trouble,
gather my belongings and decide that maybe Qeynos wasn't a great idea.  I
make it back to EC, start running along the path, see a griff and decide
that I'm probably safe...and quickly get dead.

So I'm in Highpass again royally pissed off at my luck, in NO mood to do
another FREAKING corpse recovery and delete the character.

I have little doubt anyone read down this far but I do love telling this
story. :)
