True, I was wondering if I entered in the resolution that I used, if it
would take it..  ive reset all of the values to 10, 10.. I can move it after
it's started, as long as it isn't negetive, but my resolution is ususally (I
like it best at) 1152 X 864.  could i just throw those values in?  Another
problem is that it resets its values back to the negivite each time it
runs.. well, I made that file read only so it can't change those values, and
they stay the same, and it doesn't crash or anything.  So I'm not sure if
having the values I put in there helped, or if it's reading one of the other
values and ignoring my additions.
