I was waiting on a friend of mine to finish up some business in 
Freeport, so I decided to try and track and kill one of the commanders 
(blue and light blue, at level 55) and see what it dropped. 

By the time I got even close to the commander I had a HORDE of greens 
all around me. Once I had aoe'd the lot I was down to about 50% health, 
and about the same on mana. 

I shudder to think what an untwinked level 10 character has to go 
through when leveling there :)
