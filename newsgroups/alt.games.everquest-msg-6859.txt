Heh I wasn't really looking for 'one is better' so much as I was wondering (and
I didn't know you still played the monk) why you moved to another character so
much like your monk.  Figured you must have run into a frustration with the
monk in the mid-twenties and decided to be a Warrior instead.  Heh after
playing a Wizard up to 20's how do you get used to not being able to bind and
such.. I think thats gonna be hard.  So far though, the monk seems to kick ass,
and I moved him from Freeport to Misty for the easy of hitting level 10 :)
