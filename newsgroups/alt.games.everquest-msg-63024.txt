Nice response!  Love hearing from a knowledgable tech-head :)

As for another potential issue, if you change the transmit/recieve software,
it can effect transmit rates due to small shifts in timint when
communicating with the hardware.

I saw this with a Direct X glitch a couple years ago when they incorporated
some telephony controls into the DX family of parms.  Screwed with the
system.  Roll back the DX and it straightened out.

As a software person, I tend to prefer to blame the hardware but, after a
few years of work, I check what I know first -- THEN start pointing fingers
<grin>

Ciao for now
