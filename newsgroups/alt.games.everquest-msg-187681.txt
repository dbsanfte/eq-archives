Personally I wouldn't have the original asshole or the OP in a group
of mine.  I wouldn't have stayed in a group with someone acting the
way the other guy was described as acting.  *BUT* if you *CHOOSE* to
stay in that group - live up to your fucking obligations.  He should
have left before they became reliant on his skills.  Instead he acted
like a petty little POS.  Rezzing him isn't a favor, by remaining with
the group and fighting with them, he took it on as a responsibility
(IMO) and when he decided to not rez him, he fucked a groupmate, and
the rest of the group.  Definitely grounds for blacklisting him with
my guild and allied guilds.

This type of player is one of the big reasons my buddy and I bought
a 2nd account and levelled a cleric on it - we'd had a cleric get in
a snit about a near wipe, and gate and log without rezzing me.  And
no, I was not being an ass.  I'm very accomodating, and I work hard
to maintain peace in groups I'm in.  Every group I've ever led has
been NBG, my buddy always provided the dots for symbols on him, and we
always ML'd cash drops and did even splits.  If someone looted who
wasn't ML, or who wasn't instructed to grab something ("hey, that's lore
and we have one") he got a warning and then disbanded.

Basically, if you opt to fight with us, then you fucking well stay
around until CR is over.  I have NEVER failed to offer to stay until
CR is over, even with my GF getting upset behind me because I'm
holding something up.

1.  OP decided to remain with group despite knowing the asshole
was staying with them.

2.  OP decided not to rez the asshole and left the entire group
in the lurch

Conclusion: OP is an asswipe.

There is no getting around 1 and 2 - he admitted to them in his
first post.  Obviously the conclusion is opinion - but I wouldn't
have anyone who approved of his action in my group, my guild or
an allied guild where I might have to depend on him doing his job
on a raid or in a group, and not fucking me over because he was
upset with someone.  I didn't tolerate that as a guild officer
or group leader.
