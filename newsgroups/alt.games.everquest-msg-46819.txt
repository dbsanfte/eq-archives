They were nerfed LONG ago. About the time they added a stone they drop
for a temple of sol ro quest or something the incidence (oh I did
spell that right, odd it looked funny...) of lightstones in general
lowered a lot. So no, there was no recent nerf as far as I know. 

People often go "nerf hunting" after totally unrelated patches.
