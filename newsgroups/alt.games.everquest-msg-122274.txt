Verant will no doubt rake in a load of money from this, which is their
obvious intention. Farm eq for what its worth. I wonder how long till
character transfers include items. I can see them making a good buck out of
that too. Id pay for an xfer if I didnt lose my items... move to a more
populated server. Too hard finding groups during the small hours on our
server.
