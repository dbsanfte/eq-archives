Because they have been hurt over and over and over and over again till they
won't let anyone get close to them, I should know as I have had a wall
around me most of my life.

How do you break through someone's wall?

Not really sure. I think the first step is to even get them to recognize
that you exist (I think I stumbled on a good method for that), then I assume
you would have to patiently fend off whatever they sent your way in order to
put distance between you and them as they would always involuntarily try to
keep anyone away who tried to get close to them. If I remember myself when I
was younger I used to always yearn for someone to break through my wall and
try to get close to me but no one usually did unless they wanted to use me
for something. Prayer for the person would be a good idea, I think I will
try that starting tonight, every night to see what effect it may have.
