Now why would you say that Legends is going to be all 60+AA folks?  I 
suspect that there will be quite a few high-level characters moved to 
Legends, but I'm not sure that Ubers (using your word) will be that 
excited about increased GM participation.  I suspect that the RPs are the 
ones more likely to get into GM events, since Ubers seem to be more the 
power-gamer type.  
I can't think of a single guild that has killed all the boss mobs yet, and 
the truly powerful guilds are much more than the sum of their parts.  I 
don't see much of a reason for the truly Uber to move unless they move 
with their entire guild.  When I see the first posting of ANY 57+ raiding 
guild moving en masse, then I'll give it some credence.  As it is now I 
just assume it's envy and sour grapes.
The people I see announcing that they are moving are generally hardcore 
players who AREN'T in Uberguilds, who like Roleplaying, and who want a 
more truly interactive experience.  I doubt that there will be many 
griefers or immature brats on Stormhammer, and I also doubt there will be 
an over-abundance of Uberguilds.
