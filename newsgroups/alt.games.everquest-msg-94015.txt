On 6 Mar 2002 11:26:31 -0500, Jeremiah Kristal 

Ive been fear kiting in Stonebrunt for the last 3 lvls.  The reason to
go to dl was to group and improve my defence which because of the
fear kiting is low (190). 
Perhaps i asked the wrong question where is a good zone to 
build my defence and if possiable group ?
Thanks for the info on the EJ.  I will use this zone to do the 45
hell.

Isnt 42 a bit to low for this zone, and can you get a group ?
