Let's not forget the under appreciated Necromancer who also gets FD and a
pet.  Fear kiting works incredibly well with them.  Not to mention IMHO one
of the most fun to play classes in the game.  I have a 22 Paly, 21 Wizard,
20 Warrior, and a 20 Necro, and I keep coming back to the necro because I
love playing him!  The Wizard is also fun to play but real hard to solo
with.  It can be done, but it's slow going.  Just my two cents!
