I'll have to dig up the info I worked out on shaman vs enchanter slows, 
but, at lower levels, generally, enchanters are better at slowing than 
shaman.  It's not until Turgur's Insects I believe that shaman finally 
pull ahead for good.  There are a few levels at the lower end where a 
shaman is marginally better, 1 or 2%, but mostly, the Enchanter has a 
better slow at the lower levels.  At no level is the difference very 
large however.
