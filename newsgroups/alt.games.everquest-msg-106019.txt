Ok, I don't understand the Kunzar Cloak, can anyone help shed some light on
this for me?

Kunzar Cloak
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM
AC: +7 Wis: +2 Int: +2 Fire Resist: +10
Weight: 0.1  Size: Small
Classes: All Classes
Races: Vah Shir Iksar Dwarf Ogre Troll Gnome Dark Elf Barbarian Halfling
Wood Elf High Elf
Inventory Slot: Back


Ok, if it is a size "Small" how the heck can Vah Shir, Ogres, Trolls, and
Barbarians wear this, yet my poor Half Elf Druid cannot wear it.  WTF?

Since when are Barbarians and the like "Small", and can wear something that
a Wood Elf, High Elf can wear, but a Half Elf (half human/half elf) cannot
wear it?

Is there something I'm overlooking, or am I just stupid here?  (Kind of a
moot point, as I'm wearing a Shissar Scale Cloak anyway, but it just bugs
me)
