Well, since you didn't change the reply-to or give any indication in which NG to
find you, I have to cross-post again. *sigh*

Over here, in a.g.t-s, we don't know Adam from, well, Adam. Nor do we care. We
get a lot of trollers here, and AFAIK most of the people posting couldn't be
bothered to email any stranger from Usenet, in particular one which smells like
a troll. At least I hope not. Well, the smart ones won't anyway.

heh heh

So tell dear Adam his virtue is safe with us.
Mwahahahahahahaha!!
