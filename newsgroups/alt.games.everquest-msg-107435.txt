<SNIP all too familair story>

Happened to me in SK. Kill Stealer Mage got Quill right out from under
me. It's a PITA.

What she did was thank them. That was cold. 

I am also a ham operator, and I see some people keep a lost by the
radio of call signs (people who are on the air) on ignore. It works
better than Verants solution. You can make that list as long as you
want. Those people never get a group or a buff from you. It may be of
little consequence, but you never know.
