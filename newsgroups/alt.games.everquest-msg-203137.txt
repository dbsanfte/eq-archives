Stats are simply not that important. Only a handful of them have any
visible effect and it is fairly minor. More HP (Sta) and more Mana
(wis) don't hurt of course, but how often will they be the deciding
factor?

Barbarians are popular from an RP perspective, used to be the only
non-evil shaman and have quite decent stats. 

The only abilities that might actually effect the way you play are
the racial abilities, not stats. In which case;

Troll: Regen, snare neck, JBB capable unlike iksar
Ogre: Can cast better while being beat on.

The ultimate late game shaman is probably ogre, since Torpor reduces
the importance of racial regen. Regen is still extremely nice of
course, but being able to channel a slow on the mob that's trying
to eat your liver is probably more urgent.
