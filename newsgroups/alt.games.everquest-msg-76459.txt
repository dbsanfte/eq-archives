I did a shout one day in Guk.  No one was doing the ancient croc.  I get there.
 The croc is up.  There are two guildies sitting there.  I hail them.  I /tell
them.  I dance.  I slowly strip... dancing and singing the whole time.  No
response.
I can see ONE moron going AFK but BOTH of them???
The croc is UP for cryin out loud.  5 - count em - 5 solid minutes go by.  I
finally kill the croc and move on.  About 20 minutes later I get a nasty /tell
... HELLO!!!!??????  
Thats all I have to say about "AFK campers".
 
>Afterwards, I get a tell "I appreciate your taking my spawn, I was afk
>making breakfast".
