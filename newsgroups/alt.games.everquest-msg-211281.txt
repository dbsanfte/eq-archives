I tend to feel that if an awkward law or one that is due to current vogue
or heaven forbid a media outcry leading to a crap law to suit public
opinion can be whipped up and introduced fast (the UK recently
instiituted one in 3 weeks I know but that was very atypical, and
typically a pushed law goes relatively quickly but that is still a
year or so).
A generational time to go in that situation produces imbalance...if they
were slower to come in then fine Id agree with you much much more. Im not
saying necessarily that a law ought to be able to go in 6 months
here...just a slightly more resonable balance to the instituting time

If you are in the US Im not too sure how quickly it takes to get s federal
law or state law instituted so its more difficult to comment precisely
foe me
