A hobby is different than doing something out of necessity. Besides, this
totally sidesteps the point that it is neither in character nor particularly
entertaining to have a main character in an action/adventure story spend a
significant amount of time crafting mundane items. It's supposed to be Star
Wars, not a quilting bee. I brew beer and cider, grow fruit, and carve
wooden walking sticks, but I'm not going to write an ADVENTURE story about
it.

Adventure storys and adventure games should be about *adventures* not making
frickin' pickles. Why is that such a hard concept to grasp?
