They can define it however they want, they can even tell you it doesn't 
exist. It really doesn't matter what they do. Players are using the word 
in CoH with no regard, and no need to regard what cryptic says.

This is so screwed up its not even funny. Why haven't the devs just told 
there is no harrassment in their game and 'solve' the problem entirely?
