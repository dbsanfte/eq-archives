As I understand it, cleric (and hence Pally) stuns do damage, whereas
most (all?) Enchanter stuns don't, hence they don't taunt.

Also, an enchanter probably wouldn't choose to taunt a mob off someone
onto himself (!), just make it forget about its current target so that
someone else can grab it - so think memblur, mezzes, etc.

Bear in mind my little twinky enchanter is a mere 19 levels old, so I
could be talking complete rubbish.
