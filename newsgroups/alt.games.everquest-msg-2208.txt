Ah.. I've had such a time with my enchanter. I died 3 times last night, and
2 times the night before. It's taking forever to get out of 35. There was a
nice moment last night down at the terrors in crystal caverns. We had a
tough fight, and eventually casters were OOM, melees low on health. So, I
kept the last couple mezzed while everyone medded. I was relieved, managing
to survive with a bubble of health left. Well, after a couple minutes of
healing, the monk thought the group was about ready, so without warning,
attacked one of them. Oh well, what's one more death?...
