Exodus 20: 5-11,

    5) Thou shalt not bow down to them or serve them: for I the LORD thy God
am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;

    6) And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
commandments.

    7) Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for the
Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain

    8) Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.

    9) Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work:

    10) But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou
shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant,
nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
gates:

    11) For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all
that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the
sabbath day, and hallowed it.

Beware, for your time is drawing short. Praise JESUS who is coming to save
those who choose to listen and be filled with the spirit of righteous joy.
Or curse JESUS with your arrogance and hate brought on by the deceptions of
the antichrist.

I will pray for you all. God be with you.
