Phew, Thank you Sly.  I could not get my point across.  Thank you for your 
enlightenment. I was just looking over some of the better games and realized 
this.

1. DOOM is hand optimized assembler and 'C' and its new release is 
incredible.
2. Chris Egeter who I have been in contact and is the developer of 
PowerRender.  Hand optimized assembler and 'C'
3. Michael Abrash, the single finest systems coder in the world.  Wrote a 
book about hand optimization which I own and says the only way to make the 
best game is to hand optimize.

So yes Wolf, in a non-game application sure, mods are great.  No speed 
worries, no memory worries, no drive worries etc.  But a game!  It taxes the 
system to the fullest and everything should be hand optimized.

So, if EQ II is modular, then thats a mistake, because in games you want the 
fastest and the cleanest, and the most direct route.  By definition, modular 
flies in the face of that.

Now my example:

I own a donut shop. I sell all kinds of donuts. I make my donuts pretty much 
the same way with the same type of machinery.  I want to add a donut, I 
change the filling, add more icing etc etc. They are good donuts, but not 
something that would make you crawl on your hands and knees for. Then one 
day a guy comes in and says that he can up my production 100 fold, but I can 
only make one kind of donut. But  man it is the best donut you ever had.  An 
incredible tasting donut and  I make milions of them in no time at all.  If 
I want to make a different donut, he has to design a brand new system, new 
machines, etc etc.  and it takes a long long time.

So you decide, do you want the best donut you ever tasted and as much as you 
want, or do you want sugar raised?
