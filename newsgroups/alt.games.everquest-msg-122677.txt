I logged onto my bard in GD the other night and found it was swamped with
very high-level characters.  There were tons of Dwarves lined up outside of
Thurg and a sizable squad of Giants a ways in the distance.  Several troops
of Dwarves were walking down the river and then heading back.  Eventually a
huge named giant came by and everyone wailed the piss out of him effectively
killing both the giant and my frame-rate.  Whoever was waiting for all this
to go down thanked everyone who helped, yada-yada, and mentioned thanks for
waiting since it took so long.  I asked how long it should have taken and
they replied usually no more than 3 hours, but this one had lasted almost 6.
Was this some triggered event I assume?  And what is this part of?  Some
classes epic or something?
Anyway, it was pretty cool to watch.  It was interesting plus it was a nice
departure from soloing shardwurms (read: nice break from getting nuked with
judgement for 600+).

Sean...
p.s. I don't particularly like being "judged by the gods".  It really hurts.
So far the most I've been nailed for is like 650 or so.  What is the cap for
this spell?  This new change rather worried me.
