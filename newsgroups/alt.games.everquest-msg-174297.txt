    You have plenty more people that are even more useless than a cleric
that can cast GRC. Give it to them, and let them cast it. Clerics usually
have GRC from the Wand of Casual Blessings (spell goes to others), and the
Wand is much slower casting than the spell.

    And don't even mention RC. It's like the difference between Abolish and
Counteract Disease. You cast CD over and over, when one application of AD
does the trick. So when time counts, who do you use to cure? The AD people.
Same thing with GRC versus RC.

    Then pull faster, lazy monk. We have no trouble training ourselves and
keeping busy. ;-)

    Obviously this changes for lower level guilds. Our original AoW kills
required six clerics in the CH chain. Now, three or four is more than
enough.

    Now you're saying you have lazy rogues too? What, do they all have
Bloodbath already? Any time we say "Go to Ssra for High Priest" we suddenly
have more rogues than ever before. Just this weekend, we suddenly had 12
rogues turn out to a raid. I didn't know we HAD 12 rogues.
