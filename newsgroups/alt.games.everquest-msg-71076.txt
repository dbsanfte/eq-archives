New tangent:

I'm willing to bet that Verant wasn't intending to have support for 3dfx
cards, post-SoL. Notice how the DX8 engine, while in testing, basically
didn't work with *any* 3dfx card? Verant fired up their little poll at
login, and was quite likely surprised to find that (I'm guessing here, but I
don't think it's an unreasonable estimate) 25% of their users were still
using a 3dfx-based graphics card. Amazingly enough, 3dfx cards started
working with the next release of the DX8 engine on the test server. If
they'd taken a similar poll for Win95 users, I wouldn't at all be shocked if
10% of the customers were still using Win95. That's around 40,000 people
that could possibly have been affected. :)

I honestly don't think that Verant *did* consider the ramifications of what
they were doing until the last minute. They've got a history of doing that,
sadly, and it isn't going to change until/unless their management is
replaced by people who better understand public relations. Their attitude is
that "Eh.. we'll fix it later.", and that's what's driven a lot of folks
away to DAoC.

Of course, that said, Mythic needs to realize that basing their MMORPG
almost exclusively on PvP "content" is going to be their downfall. I'd wager
that the first expansion for Camelot is going to be a MAJOR addition of PvE
content.
