Having just bought a Geforce 3 ti500 about three weeks ago, I was a
little upset hearing about the geforce 4.  But I am also willing to
take a hit in the wallet all in the name of performance.

What performance increases can we expect with a GeForce4 Ti4600?

I expect the biggest performance boost is with the 128 megs of video
ram.  It would make sense that this means less slowdown when a large
amount of people are running around in your direct field of vision. 
Is this the case?

Are there any other features that we expect will dramatically increase
enjoyment of the EQ experience?
