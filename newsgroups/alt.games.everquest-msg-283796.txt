Then you had a crap necro.  One thing to consider too is just because
a necro is under 50% health doesn't mean he needs you.  Most good
necros run between 35 and 95% due to conversions.  What will kill a
necro faster and more consistently than anything else is not having
mobs.  With insta-taps and over-time taps, a necro's health will ebb
and flow like the tide.  But at no point is he in trouble.

And of course everyone runs out of mana eventually.  The trick is
making judegement calls in the interim.  My cleric can CH, fast heal,
and nuke for about 5 mobs.  Then I need to drop back to healing only.
If the pulls are fast then I drop back to CH only, and if there's
another healer in the group I'll ask them to patch if the tank gets to
XX% (depends on overall HP and AC usually).  With my mana regen I take
about another 5 mobs to get back to full heal-boss mode.  If pulls are
still rockin I just stop nuking until I either have alot more mana or
it's more efficient to kill faster than heal.

Either way, Scroterly of the Seventh Hammer kicks ass.  It's all a
matter of choice.
