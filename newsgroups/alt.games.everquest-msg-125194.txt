Thott is one well known whiny bard.  The general feeling I see on the
bard boards is that while he does have some valid suggestions, bards
really are powerful enough now that anything else would just be icing
on the cake.  Sure, our damage numbers don't scale with level the way
that wizards do, and our healing doesn't scale the way clerics do, but
those aren't really the things a bard brings to the group.
