I doubt very seriously that they relished the idea of dropping all US based
servers during prime time. "Oh goodie!  Look what we get to do!  We get to
torque off as many people as humanly possible!  This is exactly why I came
to work today.".

No.  Probably more like: "Oh shit, this is bad.  We're gonna have to drop
'em. Shitshitshitshit.  Glad it's not my code.".

Where I decided to chime in was on your suggestion that even though they
know they have a huge problem, and even though it was severe enough to force
them to make the decision to drop the servers during prime time, you'd have
them keep the servers up until midnight (what time zone, btw ... want to
make sure you get your gaming time in) so that you can have a full night's
play.  To hell with error propogation, right?

Suppose during your uptime, you sold something to someone who acquired thet
plat via the unnamed exploit (assuming that the server drop was exploit
related).  Then you take that plat and buy the 'Cloak of Extreme Uberness'
that you've been coveting for weeks.   Do they roll back the transactions to
the point that you no longer have your cloak?

And if they do, do you come here to gripe about it?

Where do you draw the line?  You'll spend another 2 hours in meetings to
decide, then extend the outage by another hour or two to track it down if
you're going to try to do a selective rollback.  If you decide to do a
serverwide rollback to save time, then you piss off every player who was
online after the last full backup.

Drop 'em.  Simplest, cleanest solution in the long run.

Now, having said all of that ... should they test things better?
Absolutely.
Does "oops" code make it into production sometimes, no matter how long your
testing phase is?  It has in every environment I've ever worked it.

Again, shit happens.  Clean up your mess, learn from it, and move on.
