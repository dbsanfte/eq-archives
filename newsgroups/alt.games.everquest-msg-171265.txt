While its not possible to set this up as a macro, it is possible to make it
easier than opening inventory to do it.

First, you'll want an open inventory slot (no bag).  Put your cone there.

Now click and hold on that slot, so it becomes draggable.  Drag it over to a
hotkey slot.  Now do the same for your primary slot.

When you want to swap weapons, click on the cone, which will put it on your
cursor, then on the weapon slot, which will swap it with the 1hs.  For neatness,
you can then click on the inventory slot to drop the 1hs there.

For speed, you can keep the cone on the cursor, swap it with your weapon and
back to the cone whenever you like with a single click each time.

Bards use this strategy to juggle as much as two weapons and three instruments
in and out of slots during each 18 second cycle
