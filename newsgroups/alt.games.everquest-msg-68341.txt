    Don't tell me you're equating soloing in The Grey to challenge pre-nerf?

    Many people have the chat channels you use for your "general call"
turned off for reasons totally unrelated to whether or not they would be
willing to provide a Bind. I can't see how sending a single /tell, "Excuse
me (sir/ma'am), but could I purchase a Bind from you at (where you are)," to
an in-zone caster capable of Binding (verified by /who or a /con) would be
considered rude. Pursuing the matter if they don't respond or say "no", that
would be rude. But asking? This is a multiplayer game, folks should expect
others to interact with them.
