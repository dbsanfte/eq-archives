I'm still on the intro island in WoW (Teladrassil or something like
that) but I'd have to say I've found the people in WoW to generally be
nicer and less "uber" than in EQ2.  I've been astounded by the number
of times I've asked a question in the general chat channel and had
someone whisper me a detailed answer.  Maybe as I venture out more
onto the mainland this will change but so far it hasn't been close to
the jerk kid reputation that Blizzard had with Battlenet.
