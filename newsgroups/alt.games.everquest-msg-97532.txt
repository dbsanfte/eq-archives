Your druid should, at minimum, be wearing a Black Iron Medallion that is +3
WIS.

EQ Caster's Realm, eq.castersrealm.com,  has a decent equipment search where
you can specify race, class, slot, etc. that can help you see what is
available...and they don't charge you.  It might not be the most up-to-date
but it will give you a general idea.
