    Assist radius varies with the level of the person on the mob's aggro
list. You see that in action in places like Velk's, where a level 60 can
single pull a spider that has another spider almost right on top of it. A
level 55 tries the same pull and gets multiples.

    When my necromancer was levelling up in The Warrens, I used to try
moving from the zone-in down to the empty room before Prince. The pet would
get attacked by junk that had long ago stopped attacking me, because of
level. Then, once in the room, I'd have to stop pulling and pack it in if a
shaman-type mob spawned amongst the stuff I was pulling. If I tried to pull
a shaman, I'd get nuked, Jabober would get to the doorway before I could
back him off, and the stuff right outside the doorway would go nuts on us
both.
