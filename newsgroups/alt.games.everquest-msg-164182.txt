Hey, feel privaleged. I didn't make the list, probably because I got
so tired of making a fool out of him over and over again many months
ago I gave him a rare position of permanently killfiled.

I laughed when they discovered he was using a sockpuppet, though.
Apparently so many people thought he wasn't worth listening to he had
to morph to get his idiocy heard. :-)
