Hmmmm... you know there was definitely something strange going on.  At one
point the bard could not shake a mob.  I was oom and trying to cannabalize
enough to heal him or root the mob.  Bard took off running with the gnoll on
his heels, she just stood there.  I mean just STOOD there.  (Who cared anyway? 
She was only hitting for 1 - 3 damage).  Maybe it WAS someone playing 2
keyboards at once.
At any rate the bard left the group after that and I thought it was a great
time to log off myself. :)
