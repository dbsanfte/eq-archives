Our cleric is at the point in blacksmithg now where, providing I can come
up with the neccesary components this week, she will be able to make
herself a full suit of cultural imbued dwarven plate armor by the weekend.
I'm hopeful that your words are true and this will take a bit of the
strain off of her channeling skill. :-)
  Not to mention that fact that she may be able to take an order or two to
make some for other folks. Hrmmm....... wonder what a full set of that
should sell for? I know most mid level clerics would kill for it.
