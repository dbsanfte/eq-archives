You could simply have no visible vendors, buying straight from the bazaar
interface, with 16 slots for trading about with. I like that idea; i pretty
much shop blind anyway, staring at the floor and rightclicking on the ui to
get around.

The shame of it i actually was looking forward to smithing etc in the bazaar
but it would be a real pain to do it now.


On the other hand, I have seen the prices for most of the items i wanted
drop to about 30% of what they were before (with big ticket items like FBSS
pretty much the same) and have snapped up bargains where the cost was 10 %
of what it used to be. I like buying ac20 breastplate (with stat bonuses!)
for my young cleric  for 20 plat and going to beat on some firebeetles.

Good thing the monsters don't shop there, that's all i can say. I just wish
the traders would not try to sell too much stock, it end up spamming the
bazaar ui with items that can't be bought unless someone buys up their
earlier items.
