EQ is getting out of control at the high end.  They keep given out
better and better equipment, so that the reward for doing the ubermobs
will be worth it, but that's making everything else seem weak.  Hell,
on my server, there are warriors who will probably give their epics
away to NPCs (more fun than destroying them) because they are NEVER
going to use them again, because they suck compared to the things they
are getting from mobs.
