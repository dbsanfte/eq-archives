And that's a good thing, as 42 has pointed out. Everyone starts off on an 
equal footing with an equal opportunity. What exactly is your complaint 
here?

Bengh, the tradeskill designer, has said that the penalties for crafting 
losses will be taken against your artisan experience, it just isn't 
implemented yet. This is something you'd know if you were following the 
discussions in the forums that are actually on topic rather than all the 
whining posts you've been reading.

And by the way, contrary to your astonishing statement above, there IS an 
artisan bar. Open up your Persona window and take a look. Two different 
experience bars. One that says "Level 17 Shaman" and another, completely 
different one that shows a completely distinct experience amount and says 
"Level 19 Scholar". You can even toggle your main onscreen experience bar to 
display either one of the TWO different experience bars by right clicking on 
it. So, what exactly are you trying to say when you say that "there is not 
an artisan bar"? /boggle

Wrong, you've been reading too many of those complaint messages again and 
haven't paid attention. Bengh has said from the start that the tradeskilling 
system would provide encounters that make them more combat-like. They were 
in the original design and have been for some time, it's one of the things 
that attracted me to the game in the first place. They happen to have the 
added benefit of making macroing more difficult (I hope you don't really 
believe that this will *stop* macroing, lol).

There is no bazaar, there is a house vendor system and by the way, it was 
activated in the last patch a few days ago. But I'm not sure I'm getting 
your point here. What exactly is your point, that it's not a viable system 
because it hasn't been in place very long? Want to explain wtf you're 
talking about and what makes you think this wasn't part of the intended 
design?
