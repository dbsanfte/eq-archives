Was playing EQ the other night when my antivirus software kicked in for an
update...needless to say I was booted off the game.. no problem hooking back
up to game but now everything during daylight hours is as dark as a
barbarians sight during nighttime..and if its night in game time forget
it..cant see anything..this is with a High Elf. . This isnt just on the
server im normally on..but all of them.. have tried all the display
adjustments under options.. gamma etc..nothing works...even reloaded the
game...any suggestions?  Thanks in Advance.   Darby Stubbletoes.  30th
