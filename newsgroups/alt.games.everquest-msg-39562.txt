Im retiring my Luclin 42 Pally.  He is pretty loaded and I was wondering what 
to do with all the gear.  I dont have any online friends anymore and I hate to 
waste everything.  Is there a place you can sell equipment to people rather 
then let it go to waste.  

Hes got an Arby greatsword, and many other high price items and plat.  I am 
still playing the account, so dumping the account is not an option.  Just 
getting off Luclin.  Should i post here and take the highest bidders?  

email me if you got any ideas.
