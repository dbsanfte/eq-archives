I was looking at the Velious tailoring the other day.  I have a friend that
is a tailor, and who was asking me if there was anything I needed, or if she
should not bother raising skill.  On the Lokari site, it lists Silver Thread
as a component:

http://www.lokari.net/everquest/tailoring_velious.html

Is this something that has to be made, or can it be bought?

I figure on filling a few slots that I just have silk on with Crystalline
Silk Garments for now.  And perhaps later I'll get some Ice Burrower Silk
Garments, but that is a LONG term idea.

What I like about the Crystalline Silk Garments is the Save Vs. Magic.  That
will help with AE Mez.  I'm not going to replace the hand-me-down Gator
Scale Sleeves (if I remember correctly) that I have, but my silk shoes, and
other small pieces should be workable.  Also, at L31 I should be able to get
into the Crystal Caverns to hunt.  Whether that will be sufficient to get
into spider groups I do not yet know.
