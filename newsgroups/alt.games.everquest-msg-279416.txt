Ok, sounds like I'm not doing something correctly then.

65 human monk
AC 1025, HP's 2640 (still wearing Acrylia tunic, but do have Sleeves
of Constriction.  Upgrading but it goes slowly.)
Claw of the Darkfanged and Architect's Sceptre
A fair number of AA's, though not uber
	Return Kick maxed
	Double Riposte maxed
	Technique of Master Wu 1
	Ingenuity 1
	Rapid Strikes maxed
	Physical Enhancement maxed
	All the Archetype abilities maxed

I'm guessing it's mostly my gear and weapons but I'd appreciate any
comments as to upgrades.  I'm working on a magelo profile so I'll post
that once I'm done.

Thanks.

~F
