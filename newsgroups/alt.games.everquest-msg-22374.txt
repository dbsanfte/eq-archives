lol I beg to differ.....I had a lvl 13 necro iksar and was hunting in Kurn's
Castle.  We were standing in a corner and pulling the skelies there to us.
Both me and my partner were killed by the skellies, and we got a /t from a
guide <hopefully no longer a guide on Karana> telling us he was flagging us
for exploitation and if we pulled any more skelies to that corner, we would
be banned.  It didn't seem to matter to him that they were low level skelies
nor that they killed us.  I guess I am not too bright, but hey I no longer
play that necro as I prefer my DE necro....at least you can tell she is a
woman :))
