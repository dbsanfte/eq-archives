The creator of the 1st age which lasted 4000 years shall be known for the
past, The creator of the present age which lasted 2000 years and is almost
finished shall be known as the creator of the present, The creator of this
age which is soon upon us and will last 1000 years will be known as the
creator of the future and the creator of the next age will be known as the
creator of the void which will not be beholden to time as time shall then be
controlled as the flow of water through one's hands and he shall not be
known either unless he was known.
