Well I have to say much to my dismay I found myself doing the disband
and run for life with a group I picked up on an LDoN.. Had something
to do with pretty much the same circumstances but adding to the not
allowing every one to be ready, not buffing, cleric being 00m because
they chose to nuke passing mobs in oasis... so no heals ... etc..
After a couple of wipes and a random where 1 person random'd on an
item a few of us were interested in, and declared themselves winner
before anyone else rolled and looted.. I just didnt want to be there,
Id rather die 20000 times and be reset to like lvl 1 than be in a
group with those people.

Rez's should deffinately wait till the end unless you have nearly done
and a fair bit of spare time. The after effects are annoying, and only
hinder.

A lot of men seem to play females, personally as a woman I do play
occasional male chars but things like ogre women are just too ugly, Id
rather be a man.. but, I know some in game toons who are female and
most certainly are male iRL.  However, and I think a little more to
the point which moron accepts an adventure for around 90 minutes or so
and 15-20 minutes in decides they will need to leave or ask their
partner if they mind if they can stay 10 minutes more..
