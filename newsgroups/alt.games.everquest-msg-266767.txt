In beta there were boats from antonica to thundering steppes and from 
commonlands to nektolus forest. This trivialised getting from qeynos to 
freeport as you needed two completely safe boat rides and one click on a

So they removed those boats a little before it live. I imagine there may 
  well still be other boats somewhere in the game though.
