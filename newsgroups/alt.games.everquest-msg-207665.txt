First, let's restore your rather incredibly absurd comment that
you oh so conveniently snipped:
/quote "Moritmer Ollin"
Where is your evidence that the original poster is an ungrateful
societal freeloader?

Now, I did not ever accuse the OP of being an "ungrateful societal
freeloader".  Nor did I refer to anybody as being a "freeloader".
I did not use the word, nor did I imply anything even marginally
similar to the concept.  Your belief that I made such an accusation
is entirely your invention, a fabrication as absurd as it is false.

As to the absurdity you put forth above, here's a clue for you:
EQ is, in fact, played by "real life people".  For the record,
I am assuming that the OP is, in fact, one of these real life
persons.  That this person received a gift in the form of bits
in a social environment mediated via computer network does not,
in any way, make him other than a real person interacting
socially with other real persons.  Would you insist that the
way in which somebody reacted to a gift of money (an abstraction
of the "real" value intrinsic to goods and services) is somehow
distinct from "real life"?  Are you going to claim that "goods"
in EQ are not the same as "real life" goods?  If so, then why
do "real life persons" spend hundreds, if not thousands, of
dollars on these same "goods".  Or maybe you're claiming that
the emotions experienced by EQ players are somehow not real?
That the social interaction in-game is somehow unhuman?  Have
you actually given serious thought to the implications of what
you're attempting to argue here?  If so, I see little evidence
of it in your posts.

hth, feel free to have the last word,
kaev
