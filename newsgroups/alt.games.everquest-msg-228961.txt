He didn't specify, but it could be his first character which would mean
cheap is a relative term. Most low end items like Polished Bone Hoop, Gold
Stud, etcetera still sell for ~50 pp which he won't see until level 10 or
so.

Anyway, the game has changed so much it is harder to make a mistake. Figure
for the first 10 levels, no experience loss. Really, I would almost go for
some cheap AC stuff for a wizard vs. relatively expensive int items
because...

Dying is one of the fastest ways to get hit points and mana<LoH, HT, etc.>
back for levels below 10 now. Just root and burn and if you die, great. Just
memorize root and a burn and you are ready to repeat. Only contest is to
burn all your mana before you die. In my experience, burning mana was easy
to do relative to dying with mana.

There may be some problems getting into a group in PC at level 10. Probably
should make some pp and exp harvesting GLS at this level anyway. Maybe pick
up some guildmaster quest armor. As soon as his level gets good to go for
PC, just mindless and mostly safe leveling to 24ish.

First priority shouldn't be int or stamina for equpment if you can afford
it, it should be focus items or clickies. I mean I would rather have +10 int
+10 stamina +40 mana boots or MQ Journeyman Boots?
