Without wanting to kick off the whole argument *again*

With the new level limits on high-end buffs shouldn't the new level be the
same as what you can group with and still gain exp? i.e A lvl 40 can group
with a lvl 60 and still gain exp (granted - not much) but if they can group
together they should be able to utilise each members buffs -shouldn't they?

Personally I'm happy with the changes as they don't directly effect me but
anything that makes my guildies happy is fine by me :)

On another note I got a shock last night in the new Veksar zone, a lvl 53-54
pat (sentry or crusader - can't remember which) near the zonein was
summoning??? certainly made for an interesting first look :)
