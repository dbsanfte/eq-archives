I invariably restrict my opinion with a "for a home user" clause. The 
support that say a school gets (and needs) is very well met by a large 
brand.

Vancouver, BC. Too far to drive :)

The trouble with the big system builders is that they solve the problem 
by telling you to put the system restore disk in and reboot. Boom 
problem solved. Unless you actually had data, upgraded, bought 
additional hardware, new applications, changed OSes, need to run new 
reference drivers to play the new game, etc etc etc... in controlled 
static environments like a school or business, with backup policys, and 
400 identical machines the Dells of the world are great... for Joe 
HomeUser when they have a problem they do not want to roll-back to 
"good-as-new out-of-the-box".

Many large system builders don't even give you a proper installation CD. 
The 'system restore' CD is all you get, and your stuck with it.
