 I gave one on Veeshan that has that problem. It seems to happen when
the guild in question shares part of the name with another guild. For
example, trying Legion on Veeshan you get Legion of the Obsidian Dragon
(or something). In a few posts up Kilmer mentions a problem with
Pretorians on his server. 

 Trying it with no quotes, single quotes or double quotes nets you the
same result.
