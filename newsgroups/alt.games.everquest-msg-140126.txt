Whatever I don't do in Freeport, I usually do in Thurgadin. Freeport
has smithing, pottery, baking, tailoring, jewelcraft, brewing,
fletching. If there's stuff you can't do because it's in NFP, Neriak
is only a short run away.
Shadowhaven is only to buy cel solvent (which reminds me, I have to go
get that faction necklace as there's no way I'll be stocking up on
solvent in the bazaar anymore) and other luclin ingredients.
