Couple things: Considering metal bits trivial in the low 20's, a skill
in the 30s is not "*way* trivial" by a LONGSHOT. Also, trivial has
absolutely nothing to do with not being able to fail. Just means you
can't learn anything new by making the item anymore. The idiots
nitpicking the term "trivial" was why they changed that message to say
simply that "you can't advance your skill making this item anymore"
instead.

And, by the way, int has absolutely zero effect on fail/success rates.
All it effects is skill gain rate.
