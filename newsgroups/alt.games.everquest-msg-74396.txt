Dont worry. Dreadlands are safe for all level ranges, at least at the 
port spot.
There are actually 2 parts of Dreadlands, the Hidden Valley, where the 
druid and wiz ports are, and the real DL, where the mobs are. These are 
connected by a tunnel, so youre safe as long as you stay in Hidden 
Valley (in theory someone could train some mobs to hidden valley, but 
since the tunnel is VERY twisted, i think its close to impossible to do)
