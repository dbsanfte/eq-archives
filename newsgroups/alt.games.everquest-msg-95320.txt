Actually, he's right, not you.

All blues are not equal.   Mobs give experience based on what level they are,
not what color.   You can be quadding your little heart out in CS, blue as can
be, and your alt experience bar will be moving slower than it would be at 60
with a group killing mobs that are blue to them.    A level 60 killing a level
50 mob will get the exact same numerical amount of experience that a level 51
gets from killing it.   Plus he'll have one hell of an easier time doing it.
Easier and quicker.


As for benefits... the best thing you can get from AA is what, mental clarity
3?   3 points of mana regen, after going through about 15 alternate
advancement levels.      Now compare that to the druid who spent all that
experience getting to 60...  the level 60 will just cast Protection of the
Glades on himself and soak up the 6 mana per tick, while snickering at the
level 55 gloating about his puny 3 per tick.    He'll be snickering even
harder when you consider that he will have better spells, a larger mana pool,
lower casting resist rates, more hit points, vastly improved resists than the
guy who went for Alt advancement early.

It is the same for every class out there.    With the one exception of run
speed 3 (and that is debatable) there is absolutely nothing that gives more
reward per experience point than plain old normal experience leveling.

The only real reason to have it on hard before 60 is if you were a bard or
paladin that wanted to lock yourself at 52 to stay Naggy and Vox capable,
until you got the Red / White scales or Burnt / Frost books.
