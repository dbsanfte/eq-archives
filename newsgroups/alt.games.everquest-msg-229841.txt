I went and looked, and there does seem to be a higher percentage of 
awful top posted articles.  But that's not because these groups prefer it.
It's because those groups have a high percentage of naive Windows users
who try to read and post to Usenet using Outlook Express which by default
(ick) top posts.

You mean this one?

"... there does seem to be a higher percentage ..."

Not *all*, not a *high* percentage, but a *higher* percentage - presumably
higher than AGE since it is the basis for comparison.  This doesn't 
indicate that top posting is preferred.  In fact:

"But that's not because these groups prefer it ..."

Would indicate to anyone with more than a 1st grade reading comprehension
that he disagrees with you as well.

I don't doubt that you are 49 - because I've met plenty of older people
with no reading or reasoning skills.

Before you start with the incredibly devastating "pre-pubescent" charge,
I'm 36, a college graduate (3.95 GPA in Computer Information Systems).  

BTW - a search in Alt.comp.periphs.mainboard.abit on the term "Top-posting"
shows the exact same flame war as here.  There is no accepted practice
there.
