Don't pay any attention to any price any NPC merchant/vendor
gives you. They are arbitrary and have no bearing on the
actual worth of an item. There is a spear that my shaman has
that sells for 3-4000 pp to players, know what an NPC merchant
offered me for it? 6pp. =)

All prices for items are low to vendors because Verant doesn't
want anyone selling to them unless a last resort. Verant wants
players to be the main driving force in the Economy.

Never buy or sell 'good' items from or to a vendor if you can help
it. Some items however like those bronze weapons most players
would not want so the best recourse is to sell them to a vendor.
