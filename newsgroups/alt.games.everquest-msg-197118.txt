Glad you are having so much fun Kashra.

Are you doing your Vah Shir quests?  Best way to make sure you don't 
throw away something you'll need later on is to go to eqtraders and look 
up the quests page on that site.  Those quests will keep you busy for a 
long time, if you ever finish them.  Don't get frustrated if you get 
stuck at one step, work on getting items for all steps or give up for a 
while and work on your fishing for a week, fishing is something to do 
when you want to play but don't feel like dying that day.

Good luck and don't forget that you have to look for your corpse now.
