Aye, and I'm usually asking if they have any idea about whether some 
setting in my BIOS or eqclient.ini could affect everquest operation in any 
way.  And get the response 'have you sent in the such-and-such files'?

Which really shouldn't have any bearing on that question.  Either you have 
some idea and are willing to explain it, or not.

>(you know.. when people ask where the ANY key is...)

Heh.  My ex-GF's DVD player frequently switches to a mode where the phrase 
'press any button' appears on the screen.  This other ex of hers was over, 
and saw that, and reportedly turned to her and said, "your toenails look 
hideous today."

She nearly hit him, before she got it.

Risky humor is the best. :)
