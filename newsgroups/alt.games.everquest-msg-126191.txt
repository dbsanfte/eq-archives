As a matter of fact, I think tradeskills are beautifully balanced as they 
are... If everybody were a master craftsman, then they could be considered a 
failure. They went the RSI route to make them difficult, and I understand 
the frustration, but how else would they make sure that only the dedicated 
achieve master status? Making them cost a lot more money? As long as they 
avoid injury lawsuits, I find the current method good enough.
