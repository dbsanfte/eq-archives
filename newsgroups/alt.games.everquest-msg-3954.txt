I had read a quest that need to find a thing(not sure is it gems) on the
floor near the Tower of Frozen shadow. But I can't find the quest info
again. I did pick up something on the floor when I camped near the tower of
Frozen shadow. it looks like a gems in red color when its on the floor, but
its water flash named "Globe of Slush water". Im not sure whats it for and
can't find any info about it. Anyone knows?
