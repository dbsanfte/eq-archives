    I think it would be nice if you didn't top post.  That said...

   When I first read the title of this thread, my first thought was "Not
bloody likely".  But if the guide really does have a decent list of the
quests on can do, and where to find the NPC's involved, then it could be
very handy indeed.  I'd like to hope that it turns out to be so, because I
finding that I have a very low tolerance for wandering around lost these
days.
