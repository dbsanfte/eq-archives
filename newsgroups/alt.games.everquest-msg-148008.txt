I am having trouble getting one of my characters to Velious.  I have tried
gating there and taking the spires and she just gets left behind.  My other
character can gate there just fine.  Any suggestions?  I was planning to
reinstall Velious, but my original installation was the trilogy and I
wondered if  I could reinstall just Velious.  I really hope that I won't
have to completely reinstall EQ, the patch download takes forever on
dial-up.  Also, the last time I had to do that I had some problems with the
reinstall because some of the files were not deleted with the uninstall and
it caused problems.

So any input would be appreciated.  Would I need to uninstall Velious before
reinstalling it?  How do I do that?

Thanks

Sorry, no clever sig
