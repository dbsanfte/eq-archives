So you don't like specialization?  Should we all be tank-mages able to 
nuke, tank, and heal?  Should clerics get ports and hastes and slows and 
DoTs?

What?  A group of any 3 or 4 people can handle just about any exp camp in 
the game 55+.  There is NO need for the holy trinity for experience camps.  
Hell, one of the fastest EXP groups I ever had was 4 bards, a beastlord, 
and a cleric.  Would have been more effecient with a shammy instead, since 
CHeal isn't that critical on a bard MA.
Name an exp camp the *needs* the trinity.  Sure, it's easier with tank, 
healer, crowd-control, but they don't have to be warrior, cleric, 
enchanter.

Maybe you need to find a guild with people who are more fun to hang around 
with.  High level raids are social events, with a couple of minutes of 
combat thrown in.

How about this:

1.  Group and buff, chat and fashion show
2.  Multiple pullers to clear yard trash sooner
3.  Chat and tease
4.  Mob comes in, MA calls assist, all assist MA
5.  Chat and tease
6.  Off-tankers deal with adds, designated folks heal/slow/assist
7.  Chat and tease, poke fun at other classes for being gimpy
8.  Pull big mob
9.  Get serious and kill big mob
10. Distribute loot, fashion show, chat and tease

That's why you should all bind in the same place.  Nekkid duels, drunken 
nekkid races around the zone, etc.  Learn to CR quickly.  Sure it can take 
an hour, but even a TPW deep in a nasty zone can be recovered from quickly 
if you have a good strategy.  Don't blame your bad times on bad planning.  
First real run at VP a TPW requiring corpse summons, 20 minutes from dead 
to recovered and rebuffing.

OK, what raid level mob requires an enchanter to do anything OTHER than 
commit tashicide?  One enchanter is pretty important for C2/3, haste, and 
tash.  Two is nice to do it faster.  After that they're looking for things 
to do.  What guild is going to be raiding mobs that require a CHeal chain 
and NOT have a backup tank, and MA transition plans?  Hell, Velk cast his 
AE lagspike on us, MA and 2 of 3 clerics in his Cheal chain went LD, 
backup MA went LD, over 1/2 the raid either LD or dead to lag, and Velk 
still died.  I find it stupid that some raids seem to think that numbers 
are more important than tactics.
