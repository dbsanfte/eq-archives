Do I have to do something that makes me talk in DE or is it a given that 
when I talk in a group I am speaking in DE and the others in my group are 
speaking in their own language?
I guess this is basic, but I don't get skill-ups in languages much so I must 
be doing something wrong.

Thanks for the info......Ben
