I usually play on Tallon Zek, and as a druid my biggest fear is a
necromancer. They are evil. They Dot you, Life dot you, and life tap you.
And sick a pet on you. Where as yes, a mage can sick icy earth pet on you,
but you can get away from that with sow, and Dot the mage. Bards arnt that
hard. All i have to do put up skin like steel, and my self only damage
shield, and my other damage shield, and dot and nuke the bard. They go down
rather fast.
