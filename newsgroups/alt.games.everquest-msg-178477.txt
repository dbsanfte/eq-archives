meet chief goonda.  he's a 30ish shaman, and on different faction than the
ogres around him.  he conned blue to me once when i was playing in WK, so i
decided to check it out.  conned a few of his pals from far away, all
amiable.  cool, i'll go hail him, see if he has something interesting to
say.

apparently the only thing he could come up with was "Sic her, fluffy!" as
his pet started beating on me and he started casting.  fortunately my sow
was able to outrun his and his pet's and i made the long journey to the
qeynos hills zoneline.
