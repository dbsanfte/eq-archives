Also, perhaps more importantly, the level 49 beastlord spell.

Those 4 matter more for a beastlord, I keep this up at all times.  The
increases are nice for not much mana, especially the Dex if you have
proccing weapons, and it stacks with all other buffs I can cast on myself.
The only thing that sucks is that it greys out all spell gems for a good
while, so I usually try to cast it just before medding a bit.  Well, also
the fact that my abjuration is low enough that it fizzles a good percentage
of the time, but that's just pure laziness on my part :-)
