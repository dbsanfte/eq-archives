  There's no real rule of thumb, except to say that good items are
generally worth more than lame/mediocre ones. ;)  There are just too
many factors to consider on most items.  In addition to the attributes
you mentioned, there's also the matter of who the item can be used
by... whether or not it's lore... whether or not it's a primary or
secondary weapon... what weapon type it is... what level it procs at
if it has a proc... what it looks like... what it weighs... whether or
not it can fit in most containers... the rarity of the item or how
easy/difficult or expensive it is to initially obtain... ect.

  Item worth is determined by supply vs. demand.  It's a very inexact
science, since supply and demand will fluctuate, especially after the
addition of new content (like Luclin).  The only truly reliable way to
get an item about the worth of an item is to pay attention to what
items are selling for in market areas (and also see if the items seem
to be actually selling at the proffered prices.)  You can figure out
what an item is worth to YOU, but it's impossible to entirely forsee
what it'll be worth to everyone else.
