Everybody builds lousy code.  Most of us, however, have to correct the
defects (design and implementation) before we send it internally for
system test, let alone release to a customer.  Microsoft just calls it
a release and ships it.  Then, after a year or three of graciously
allowing millions of people to pay them a premium price for the
privilege of beta testing their crap, they are more than happy to charge
again for the working version... which may or may not actually work.
