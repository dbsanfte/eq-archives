It was a pot-shot at me crossing over from a thread I killfiled about
uber guilds with obscenely outrageous requirements. I'd questioned
what would be wrong with the guild letting lower levels in that maybe
could be "groomed" for the higher level raids when the guild wasn't
performing said raids... And I'd stated that I thought such entry
requirements as they had were elitist, at which point several people
tore into me basicly telling me I didn't have a right to such an
opinion...
