Ah, cool, thanks Ken. :)  I did do a google search before I even posted my
first response and the hits looked positive (I didn't go deeply into it),
but, like I said, he's never posted here before.

If I remember to check mail at home I have a link to his site...I'll likely
try it out tonight, if I can get around the danged Checkpoint VPN software I
have loaded (it hates LANs).  I'm using MapTracker, and really like that
software as well.
