Actually what I was looking for was a MOG that was more casual player
friendly without the long camps and time commitements to play. I jus
thad not realized it yet.

I currently have found that in EQOA and am enjoying it immensely so
far. I am able to get on for small blocks of time and also pretty much
be able to get out quickly as needed. I greatly love the quests in the
game. When I am on a quest I can usally stop at a moments notice and
come back later to pick it up. There are no long camps for MOBS to
spawn. Most spawn very quickly and are on positional triggers.

Most single player games have a pause etc, MOGs of course do not.
Anyway when I wrote my farewell I had not clue there might be MOGs
that would be able to accomodate my playing desires. So my intent was
to play single player games only. Problem with SP games of course is
that there is no player interaction as in a MOG. I missed that.

Anyway sorry to confuse folks. I know many people still enjoy playing
EQPC. That is great. It just was not the game for me. It took me
awhile to realize why and to find what I enjoy.

Happy Adventuring!
