Not necessarily, Haste items are effected by level but there is nothing on
the item description to tell you this.
Whether or not the new haste items with (recommended) level limits do not
work below level I have no idea but I would guess the effect is as always
and only the stats are adjusted. I would test it with my Soulscream
belt....but I can't be bothered and besides, if I prove that the haste works
the same as all other haste items then it'll kill the price of the RBG I'm
trying to sell.

Saying that, I agree, I have never heard of the Regen of any item being
effected by level. This is why the item is used as a P/L tool.
