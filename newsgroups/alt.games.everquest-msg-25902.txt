This probably varies by server and individual GM's, but I know of two
seperate instances of GM's helping with corpse retrieval in the Hole on the
Seventh Hammer. These were both high teen characters, and the instances were
about 1 month apart.Both instances occurred to guildmates of mine, and I was
actually present when one of them lagged out and ran off the edge of the
hole, after zoning in from Toxx.

Usually the GM goes down and clears the area, then summons you to your
corpse, and once you've looted they summon you out. I highly doubt they'd go
to the trouble if they knew for sure that you did it on purpose though =)
