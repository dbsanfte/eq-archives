Two problems with that solution, one, it's hard to find a good background 
shade for all the various colors, two, the chat boxes sit on top of my 
viewport, and, if the color is too far off, it interferes with seeing 
what is behind the window.

I would love to see them allow us to change the con color text, but, from 
my viewpoint, the change they did make was a significant improvement.  It 
does detrimentally affect a small percentage of users, but, it is an 
improvement for the majority of users.
