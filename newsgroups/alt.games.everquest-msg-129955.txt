Nah, it's more like the difference in validity between Clinton's
claim that he "did not have sex with that woman", and Clinton's
claim that he wanted to be President of the US.

Palestine gets a mention every time Middle Eastern politics
comes around because it is the open sore in the area.  For
any Middle Eastern leader (cf Saddam Hussein), it's the
easy way to try to get public opinion on side around there -
it's like shooting fish in a barrel to say "what about the
Palestinians?"  Add to that the widespread anti-American
feeling around there, and presto - everyone wears bin
Laden T-shirts.

In fact, about the only crisis I can think of where Palestine
has *not* been mentioned was the recent face-off between
India and Pakistan.
