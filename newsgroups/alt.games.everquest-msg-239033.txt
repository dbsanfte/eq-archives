A lot of firewalls check when a program accesses the

internet to see if the checksum of the executable has

changed since last time (to protect against trojans).

When EQ tries to contact the login server, if there

has been a patch, it's at this point that firewall

software kicks in and complains... but because EQ

doesn't surrender "focus" to the firewall software,

the dialog box thrown up by the firewall to say "something

has changed, is this OK?" is behind EQ's window, and

you're stuck because you can't then get back into EQ.

Every patch day, there's posts by people who have

this problem. Turn off the firewall, login as normal,

turn it back on again.
