Yes, yes..... I broke down and played for a while after all this talk
about necros. Just quietly logged on for a bit to play my baby necro. I
think I'm just starting to see why everybody raves over them.  A level 4
necro soloing a yellow con rattlesnake with a pet that cons yellow to
me? Krist onna Krutch! I remember my wizard getting killed by those
things at level 7 or 8!!!!
  I can't even imagine what they were like before they were "massively
nerfed" as everyone says they were. (In comparison to the very first
days of EQ, that is.)
