    You're assuming they're evenly distrubuted around the servers, which
they aren't (think of servers like Stormhammer). You're also assuming
they're not in invisible mode (/anon). And you're not counting people like
the GM they leave in Chat, or GMs that are reading e-mail from the web site,
who would be counted above. If anything, when you consider all those
factors, you understand why GM support is so miserable with only 50 people
doing all those things for all servers.
