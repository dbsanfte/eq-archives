Other than the mail runs, are there any other quests a lvl 10 bard can do around
the freeport area or anywhere in Faydwer? I've asked around the bard's guilds in
both Kelethin and Freeport and the only other quest they give out is the newbie
quest in Kelethin where collect spiderling silks for a drum. Are there any
quests where I am or will I have to go to Qeynos for better quests?

Thanks in advance. 

Cheers Watchman. :)
