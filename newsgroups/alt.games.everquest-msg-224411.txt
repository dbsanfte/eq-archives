This doesn't matter anymore.  When you are feared, you run away at the
same speed regardless.

In this case, you can duck or switch on 'walk'.

Many people will say I am wrong on this, but as a person who didn't
bother with anything other than run1 until level 62 or so, I would say
that runspeed AAs are a bit overrated for classes that can cast SoW. 
They are superior to relying on buffs, they can't be dispelled, blah
blah blah.  So get them when you hit level 65.

In all the time I spent leveling from 51 to 62, I never once died
because SoW was dispelled and I never once held up anyone in a
dungeon.  In fact in my experience, raid parties move slooooooow.  You
are always held up by AFK's, people not paying attention, LD's, etc. 
Most of the time you could keep up while snared.  About the only
frustration I ever had, which was rare, was that I ran out of buff
slots.  (Not at all uncommon for a Ranger).  Yeah there is a
disadvantage to not having run 3 but, at least in my experience, it
mattered to me so *little* that the extra bother of putting off
leveling for a few levels in my 50's would have been much more of a
pain.

Your experience may vary.  If you guild likes to hunt in Skyfire, or
you kill a lot of dispelling bosses on raids, or if you like to go on
marathon races inside dungeons, you may get more use out of it.  If
you are a monk or bard and need to pull a lot indoors, you may get
more use out of it.  But as for me, I say just get to at least level
60 before even bothering.

Don't get Run3 just because everyone says that is what you are
supposed to do.
