Do what you want, it's your money.

I think the best use I have seen of these are where players are in a full
group, and the bot stays outside and buffs and heals as needed.  As a
supporting role they can help greatly.

Personally I don't like to solo in EQ, I like the social grouping aspects, I
mean why be online with so many ppl if you spend all your time avoiding
them!
