i think i got it, as i'm now downloading Velious and Kunark.

the patcher program simple checks for "vpatch.exe" and "kpatch.exe" (and
"ppatch.exe" for Planes of Power).

I just right clicked in the game directory, created a 'New Text
Document.txt' file, and renamed it to "kpatch.exe" ... Ruins of Kunark
suddenly appeared as a download option in my Patcher. same thing when i did
it for Velious.

is there any reason to grab Planes of Power? will i be able to see new
graphics or anything?
