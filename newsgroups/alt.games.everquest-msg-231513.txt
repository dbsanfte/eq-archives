I have to agree. I went from 1/2 yellow into 62 (on friday evening) to 
64 and 1.5 yellow by Sunday night just in that camp. The xp is insane, 
and necros and druids really do the trick. We had, at one point, a druid 
puller, a couple necros, a couple wizards, and a cleric. The druid was 
bringing back as many as five at a time and we were just keeping them 
snared, running in circles, a herd of pets on them, dots, and the 
wizards and cleric standing in the center blowing them up after the 
kiters established rage aggro. It was just nuts the way the xp flew in.
