Well, I have something that MAY be relevant. A few days ago a friend
of mine was camping the WL zoneline (56 Cleric and 52ish Bard) for
faction, basically on his own. He had plate legs drop off one of the
wanderes that comes quite close to the zone. He said him and his bard
had little trouble killing the mob so I am assuming a mid 30's mob. It
mat just be possible that Verant have decided to make blank armor
drops a VERY rare drop outside the Arena.

Our guild has has VERY successful days in the arena with 20 something
drop in a 5 hour session. Usually tho we expect 1 or so an hour. We
have had similar days in Halls of Testing too.
