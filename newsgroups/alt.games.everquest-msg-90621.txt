See? SEE? I fucking *ALWAYS* do everything backwards. I got my warrior
to champion, and THEN I started a necro. *sigh*.

I'll admit to not having followed it closely enough, as I'm not putting
one scrap of xp into AA until I get a safety bubble into 55. But I'll go
check up on that this week and report back. I think Demorgorth has been
doing some research on it already though and made a few comments here.
He could probably say faster and more accuratel than I. (Not to mention
that I imagine he's funneling 100% into AA right now.)

Yeah, I'll certainly give you that. And I'm getting to experience it all
over again with my untwinked baby leezard warrior on Innoruuk. But
having nearly 55 levels of tanking to put it into perspective, I still
think it's a small price to pay for the massive benefits of playing one
of the "unholy trinity" in the end game. And once you're guilded and
regularly traveling with the other key classes, your dangerous
travelling days and CR's are over. I don't remember the last time I've
moved my fat ass further from my bind point than to the banker's window
after dying. I just wait for my rez and grab a beer and a snack.

Anyone bitching about how tough warriors have it should try playing some
of the other classes to the end game. Particularly the hybrids, necros,
and druids. In comparison, while I hate to admit it, I've been on easy
street for the last thirty levels since I started grouping constantly
with Tiru and Orlun, and having ready access to porters and other
classes.
