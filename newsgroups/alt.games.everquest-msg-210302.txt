Rangers solo well, so the Ranger will probably be *easier* to level up.
That doesn't answer the question you asked, but it is something you might
want to consider.

At high levels, I'd say Warriors are more essential than Rangers, but
generally a group (or even a whole raid) only needs *one* Warrior, whereas
the more Rangers, the merrier.
