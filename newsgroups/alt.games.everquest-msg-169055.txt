Its called Morel Thule

There are several uber guilds which won't group with or do anything with anyone else.

Then there are a number of guilds and a fair number of guildless people which mix
freely.

Most of us have grouped before, or at least there's someone else in the group thats
grouped before, or at a minimum we at least know people in each others' guilds.


The people who are really cutthroat have a hard time getting groups with the more
"we're all in this together" people, and vice versa.

Also, many of us were in lower rank guilds in the past, often together, in a way its as
though I'm in a 300 person extended guild.  I even get to group with one of the uber
guilds that isn't supposed to let me, because I know about a third of them and in fact
was an applicant... I turned them down because I didn't want to live in their rules
set.  But I guess technically I'm still on the applicant roles so they can turn a blind
eye.

I'd also attribute some of it to me being a cleric and taking somewhat of a leadership
role when it comes to these matters... but you are an enchanter and should have much
the same power of persuasion.

Further, it helps a Lot that POP is all nice and tight, no long journeys to anything; a
trip to the library is three zones away, you know.  When you are talking about a 3K to
20K item turnin, is it really a lot to ask that you take five minutes out of your day
to go do the turnin?  I've even done it mid camp, when someone needed a bathroom break!

Perhaps a similar extended community exists on your server, and you aren't in it.  Or
maybe one doesn't, I know the other servers I was on had some radically different
flavors to them.
