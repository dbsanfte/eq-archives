I have my eye on a few pieces of COBALT armor.  Today I saw COBALT Guantlets
going for 750 pp in the Bazaar on the Innoruuk Server.  25AC and clickable
Reckless Strength buff.  Also saw Cobalt boots going for 1200 pp.  25AC and
clickable Strength Of Kunzar buff.  I do not think the two stack so you
would have to pick which buff you wanted to use.  The most expensive piece
of COBALT armor is the Breastplate.  It was selling for 50Kpp but has a
45AC, +12 Str, +12 Sta, +12 Dex, +50 HP.
The cool thing about COBALT Bracers is they have the ability to Shrink you.
As a Troll, you are like my Barbarian when it comes to trying to squeeze
into tight spaces.
