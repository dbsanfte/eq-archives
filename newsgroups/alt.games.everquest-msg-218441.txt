Yes, thats the "in practice part" of my post.  I think 42 saw
that, though, and was suggesting the lesser position that the two
bards literally solo unless in need of help, with no 20% bonus
due to grouping or anything most of the time, but get that slight
boost plus free heals or whatever small help they can lend during
each other's down times, and be ready in case of emergencies. 
They are grouped in form but get few of the usual benefits...
except that when help is needed, well its a lot easier for a bard
to help someone he's grouped with.
