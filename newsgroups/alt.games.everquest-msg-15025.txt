I have to agree, but make an argument. Some of us have to solo quite a
lot because of our odd hours. I play 5 or 6 hours a week, but in odd
increments. An hour here, 2 there, or maybe a strech of 6 all at once.
In some places I can group for an hour, but I am honest about it.
Because I refuse to group without letting the group know I have to go
in an hour, dungeon grouping is near impossible. And soloing a dungeon
is suicide, except upper GUK, and there only if you have never killed
a frog, and aren't hunting them. (Those crocs are nice exp, BTW) I
admit my dungeon skills are bad, but how can I increse them in my
situation? 

You get better at not slaughtering your party (12)
