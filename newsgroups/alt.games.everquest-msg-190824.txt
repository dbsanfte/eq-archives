I think they were a better theme....undoubtedly the graphic for the new
ones is a better graphic - more resolution etc etc. I just dont like the
theme of the humanistic ones. The exception is the Earth elemental of the
current crop now that I like (and I never saw why an earth elemental
should ever float).

I'd prefer the graphic quality of the cureent ones with the theme of older
ones....and air elemental should be a wispy semi transparent thing for my
taste, flames for a fire elemental not some imp on a glowing red pillow
