In the heat of battle the healee cares, as does the healer. With lag and
packet sizes getting higher by the day, the HP bar no longer tells the
whole story. If I'm tanking, it's lovely to be able to just quickly see
that I got XXhp back - instead of glancing at my HP bar and having to
wait for an update to see where it is.

I see it as a good thing. One more line in an already cluttered chat
window isn't going to bug me one bit.

If it does you, I recommend you play an enchanter sometime. You get used
to quickly and easily absorbing and deciphering what's happening during a
fight even with a gazillion lines flying by every second.
