  Be sure to check the "Scheduled Downtime" link as well.  You would think that
if the servers are down, this is information that would be included in the
"Network Status" section of the web site, but the first thing I learned about
EverQuest is that that isn't true.

  Verant has a spotty reputation in this regard.  Sometimes they do a good job
informing players of downtime and what's going on, lots of times they don't.  I
think they did a pretty good job on this particular patch, but they should have
better updated the Network Status page to reflect the fact that the game was
down... that's what the thing is there for, after all.

  I think Verant should make an effort to bring information on network status,
scheduled downtime and known bugs and tech issues TO their customers so that
periodically visiting and digging through their web site for this sort of
information isn't necessary.  I essentially think that they should modify the
patcher to display a MOTD (message of the day) the same way server GMs can set
one.  Whenever you connect to the game, this MOTD would be downloaded and
displayed, either on the login screen, or somewhere within the patcher window.
Reading the MOTD wouldn't make it disappear the next time you log in (like patch
messages are)... it would remain until the MOTD is updated.

  I'm SURE that it wouldn't be a terribly difficult thing to code.  Heck, I
could probably do it with my very rudimentary programming abilities.
Maintaining and updating the MOTD would be no more resource intensive than
updating the web site and I KNOW that a lot of us would really appreciate it.
I've made this suggestion to Verant, but so far, no response.
