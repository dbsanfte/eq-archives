I use the POS Outlook Express. Reply's are nicely placed under and indented
to the message they refer to. The post are also listed in the order they are
sent. I wonder how many here are reading from the web?  I guess I should
bottom post at my inconvenience to make your life more convent. That seems
to be the trend these days. Everyone can inconveniently bottom post so we
can say we are following the rules.
