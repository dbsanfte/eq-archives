When you hit the first level at which you can get AA, leave 100 real till
you are far enough in not to lose level when you die, then turn to 100%
AA.  Get one point, put that in Run.  Turn it back to 100% real and forget
you ever heard of AA until you get to 60, unless you have a very good
reason to do otherwise.  For most classes, no AA ability is worth more
than your next level.  Pulling classes might be better served by staying
100% AA till you get run 3.

At 61, getting exp becomes harder.  So there's a legitimate reason to stop
at 60 and grind AA if there are any AA you really want.  By then I'm sure
you'll know which AA you want and how much of your time they might be
worth.  As a cleric, there's not one thing on my list that comes even
close to Supernal Remedy, so getting to 61 ASAP was a better call.
