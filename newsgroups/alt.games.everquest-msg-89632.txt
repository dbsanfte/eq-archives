I play on an everquest special compatible rig. Of everyone I know I
have the least trouble, never crash do okay running around with low
textures and all luclin models enabled with social animations, with
umbra/dpvs working great.

Of course I don't think most would want my p2 400, tnt 16 meg agp, 576
meg ram computer with windows 98 as a new computer just to play
Everquest, even though I play better right now than some people with
systems 3 times as powerful (some of who have not been able to play at
all since the most recent patch)
