While looking at today's Test update (which included info on the new
way tribute is working (you can activate it from anywhere but only
those you set at the tribute master, so no tiers or downgrading or
picking new ones, and also you are prepaying favor which means if you
turn it on and then off you're charged for the full ten minutes which
then resets if you turn it on again, if you follow me) and the new
augment system, got caught by surprise by *this*:

Monday Jun 28th Update

- Zoning pets are in. Persistent pet data includes: Items, Spell
Effects, hit points, mana, name, height, and mana cost to summon them.
All PC summoned pets should zone with you in all instances except for
when you die. Pets will also follow the same rules as no rent items if
you log with a pet.
