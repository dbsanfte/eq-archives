You got to love dumpster diving.  A couple years ago I fished out a
1.4GHz P4 with 1GB PC800 and bad power supply.  $40 later and a spare
hard drive, I got one working :)  Not often I find any decent PCs but
when I do, it's freebie. :)

You should see my setup.  A total of 12 power supply strips.  I had
considered building a custom power strip using multiple 2 game boxes
and heavy grade power cable.  My desk alone has 2 printers, usb hub,
2x external hard drive, scanner, game pad, cable for digital camera
and firewire video camera, 17" LCD, and 15" LCD for my laptop with
busted screen.  Oh yeah my PC too with 2 power cords for power supply
and water cooling pump.

Try my video game setup.  After nearly 30 years, one can easily have
more than a dozen assorted systems all hooked up at once with
satellite, VCR, DVD player, and a TV in one space no bigger than a
typical kid's bedroom closet.  When you live in an apartment, space is
often at premium.  Some people over at www.atariage.com forum and
www.digipress.com forum have much more impressive setup with more
nightmarish cable setup ;)  Now sure who has #1 worse setup in
computer setup.

One whole bedroom is dedicated just to computers with a total of 4
desktops, 2 semi-permanet laptops (one broken screen, one with bad
keyboard and bad trackpad) and via wireless network 2 more desktops in
other room plus GC and PS2.  I figure this tiny 3 bedroom apartment
has more cables than most schools.

My messy setup is already self aware.  Last time I tried to clean up,
I ended up with 3 power cables and a power supply brick that I have no
idea where it went and 2 extra USB hubs that was connected only to
each other.  And a couple skeletal remains of mouse (rodent, not
computer peripheral)

On a good night, my brother and some friends can all play EQ in the
same room.
