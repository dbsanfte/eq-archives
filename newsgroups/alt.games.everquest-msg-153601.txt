But mages currently put out plenty of damage... since the pet changes
meant that they could send their pets in to fight.  This change will
certainly add to their max damage output as they will be able
to nuke in addition, but it won't take them from "no damage" to
"lot of damage" it will take them from "some damage" to "more
damage but not really all that much"

I didn't previously note the once per minute part.  This means mod rods
are essentially dead.  Thats less mana than a single CHeal, once per minute.
Since I'm used to casting about five CHeal per minute, one charge of
360 mana isn't going to put a dent in my 2000 mana per minute operating
budget.  Now I need two bards, two necros, KEI and FT15 to come
even close to supporting this kind of continuous healing.  Which I suppose
is the point, but unless they are chopping the HP totals of a LOT of mobs
down to about a quarter of their current totals, what they really just did
is drastically increase the size of a raid force needed to take on just
about any boss mob.

A number like 500?  Or a number like 5 mobs that most of you will never see
anyway?

Why before?  No chance.  During.  Every time it pops up, the instant
it pops up, on each cleric.  Mages won't be able to drop rods in a stack
pre battle and then go in and fight, now they will have to actively monitor
and juggle rods out to people on timers.  Ick!

I have no problem with this "fix" except that it doesn't seem to matter much
at all except for five or six mobs in current content, and perhaps some
high end mobs in the new endgame.   I don't see how a slightly smaller
cap to Cheal is going to mean new tactics, frankly, unless better heals
are introduced, Cheal is going to stay best and therefore CHeal chains
are still going to be used.

While nerfing monks is one approach, it doesn't address the fact that high
end rangers and rogues can also reach cap AC, and it doesn't address the
fact that warriors can Easily reach cap AC long long before getting endgame
equipment loadout.  Warriors single claim to fame is a high defensive ability,
and they reach cap on that astonishingly early.

Rather than specifically nerf out monks, why didn't they reduce the soft
AC cap?  Like with Wis/Int, where they left the soft cap at 200, but
increased the effect of stats over that cap, making them more desirable?

AC over 1200 should have a greater effect than it does, so a warrior
with 1400 AC is noticably better than a warrior with 1300 AC.  Then
perhaps you'd continue to see a pyramid effect for tanking capability,
with Warriors on top, paladin/SK next, rogue/ranger next, and monks/
beastlords on the bottom.  As it stands, monks just got lowered off
the apex, but the rest of the pyramid still resembles a flat plane at the
high end.
