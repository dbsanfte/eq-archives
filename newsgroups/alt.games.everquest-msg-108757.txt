We've had people as low as 53 or so come and be productive.

Our lowest that was ever actually there was when one guy (who is nowhere near
my favorite guildmember) brought his level 51 enchanter twink.  I don't think
you can really count that though, as all he did was stand around being healed
from AE damage, and fuck up aggro by tashing at inoportune moments, even
though he wasn't supposed to be casting it at all.  We had other, better
enchanters for that.   Too low to buff, too low to debuff, too low for
anything.

As a side note, I've never been so happy to see loot awarded at a raid as on
that one.   Had he walked away with the caster legs that dropped there, I
would have been seriously pissed off.
