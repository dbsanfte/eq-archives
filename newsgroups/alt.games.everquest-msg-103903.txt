Hi,

after a few of this messages, I just reread the manual ( the german one ).
It tells newbies to beg to NPCs and PCs !!!
They say, just tell the older ones that you�re new to this game, they will
help you with advice and items.

I just don�t think that would be the right way but a little advice or help
( on problems a nebie always has ) would be wonderful. Again: it�s not for
items, just for help !!!

After I�ve read all this messages, I wonder if I�m on the right server :-)
There�re kind people in this game, I just hadn�t met yet ;-)

See you and thanks a lot

Christian
