Before I quit EQ, my left eyelid used to twitch a lot.  I quit, and it 
stopped.  The first day that I started playing again, it started twitching 
again.  In fact, it's twitching, now.

I think it's related to lack of sleep.  I'm getting about 2 hours less a 
night than I used to when I quit playing.
