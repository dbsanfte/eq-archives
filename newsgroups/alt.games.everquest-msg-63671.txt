Oh... is that the only edition without the tutorial in it?

I seem to remember some people complaining that some versions of Kunark
didn't have it either.

I have put something in the FAQ, in case people get befuddled, but I doubt
most people have ever played the tutorial, (I know I didn't, for a long
while), because they want to get online as soon as possible. And, that for
me was better than any tutorial.
