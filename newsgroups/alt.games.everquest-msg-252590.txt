I think that two-boxing takes some practice to get good at.  I've two 
boxed in most my experience groups since lvl 30 or so.  I've two boxed a 
couple naggy kills (long ago) and several vox kills (almost as long 
ago).  I've managed to die or fail at numerous PoJ trials and succeeded 
twice while two boxing (warrior and cleric).  First of those successful 
attempts the monk died but otherwise went well =)  A win's a win right?

Raiding while two boxing is difficult, just due to information overload 
generally.  This is especially true with a ch chain and separate 
channels for healers etc.

Two boxing LDON adventures is almost as rough (with two low dps classes 
like war/clr) as doing PoJ trials.  A good bard/chanter for pulling 
helps :)  I two boxed Faydedar bout two weeks ago without a problem 
except for being a little lom at the end.
