Ok, well its more of an annoyance.

To get any level 24 pet save for the Earth one, you have to
research it (or buy it from someone who did)

This requires an elemental grimoire, which you can buy at any
mage guild and is a reusable container, so no big deal except
that you have to sacrifice an inventory slot to a mere 4 slot
container; with the bank expansion from LOY thats a pretty
trivial sacrifice.

And it requires a drop word; dimension in this case.  I've never
looted one myself, despite doing some hunting in zones where they
seem to drop (and are said to drop), but I've seen them on
vendors in those zones and in the bazaar.

Plus a different item for each type of pet; jade shard, pearl
shard, ice of velious.  Again, these things don't drop often at
all, but at least I -have- seen them drop.

But thats not my real complaint.  You also need a copy of the
previous level's pet spell of that type.  The air pet is
available anywhere, but the water and fire pets are available
only in the Ocean of Tears... which means I'm condemned to using
the thrice damned boats!  And they cost 10pp each, as an
untwinked mage thats actually real money, I can't buy a bunch of
copies to carry around hoping to get the right words and shards.

I failed water twice now, successfully made fire, haven't tried
air... because water is the one I really need, the only focus
item I have so far is the Stein!  At any rate, that means I've
been to the OOT vendor trying this twice already and have to go
at least once more.

But it gets worse; to get my level 29 pets I'll need the level 24
spells, which means I'll have to research them and that means
getting the 20 spells yet again.  And again next level and again
next level.  I'll need dozens of Words of Dimensions, and lots of
the various shards too, considering that I can fail either the
basic combine (to get 24 pet) or the next one (to get the 29 pet)
or the next one (for the 34 pet) etc etc.

Painful enough to have to do all that combining, when I never
wanted to be a tradeskiller... but imagine all those trips to the
OOT!
