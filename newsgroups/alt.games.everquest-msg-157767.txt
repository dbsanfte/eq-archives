Some is the key word here. Yes - for SOME this will be true. For many
others it wont. One thing ive noticed is that many DONT want to do
things for themselves. They DONT want to accomplish things all by
themselves. They want things done FOR them. Theyd rather be given that
uber item than earn it. Theyd much rather get that port than run 2
zones over.
