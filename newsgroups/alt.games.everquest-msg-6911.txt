Actually its 105 charisma. Anything higher is pointless as far
as pricing is concerned. Also make sure you have "indifferent"
faction or better with the NPC merchant in question. If you
are "apprehensive" to them then they will charge you MUCH higher
prices. Also, shop around to different vendors for selling loot, some
merchants have a 'greed' factor added to them. For instance the
Erudite merchant in South Ro in the NW corner has the absolute
worst greed in the game that I have seen, buy or sell nothing from
him unless you are desperate.
