They most certainly *will*.  I have been summoned multiple
times in the same fight while merrily smacking away at a
mob the entire time with my axe.

Furthermore, Verant is wrong when they claim that the Z
axis somehow prevents summoning.  It doesn't.

Conquest claims that their clerics most certainly were
getting summoned (and some killed), which was exactly
why they were using CoH on them to yank them back down
under the bridge.  (Basically, Conquest was engaging the
mob in a summoning contest, with the Clerics as the
ping-pong balls).  Verant needs to get their story straight --
if the clerics weren't being summoned, they why is Verant
also bitching about CoH'ing them?  There wouldn't be any
*need* for CoH if the Clerics were truly as unsummonable
and untouchable as Verant claims they were.

Untrue, it has happened to me many times.

Ahem -- why would there be a *need* to clear the Clerics from
the hate list if, as Verant alleges, the Clerics couldn't be
reached or summoned anyway?
