I have had this dream that my d&d buddies would be great in EQ.But either
they didn't have a computer and were interested in EQ.Or weren't interested
in EQ and had a computer.I have pimped it 24/7 with them.the one who has a
computer I have given a free downloaded burned CD plus the free CD
code(legal not pirated codes)  just to get him involved.But I think its
still on his desk.I give up.Not to sound too much like sex and the city
but.What does it take to break the trend from pen and paper to point and
click?
