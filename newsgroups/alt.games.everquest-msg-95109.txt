The poison spells are supposed to be quested in Shar Vahl according to sources but the quest are broken. As of right now the poison
spells can only be bought in Halas, Feerot or Cabilis. Flash of light is also supposed to quested and is broken. It can be found in
lots more places because clerics also get this spell so most cleric guilds have it. Unfortunately none of these places are on the
moon so if you want to be a Vah Shir shaman you are gonna have to get some help getting the spells or relocate. Beastlords are in
the same boat as well.
