To the best of my knowledge there is no link whatsoever between the 
quests.  If you enter the normal FG, you can get the cleansing quest, not 
sure if it is also available in the Foul Wind instance or not.  To get 
the cleansing quest, talk to one of the NPCs in the fort, only one will 
give you a quest.

I assume that not everyone needs to have the Foul Wind quest in order for 
you to complete it, but someone who has the quest must be the one to 
click in, and he must select the Foul Wind instance.
