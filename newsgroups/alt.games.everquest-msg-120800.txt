If you're not willing to offer up front, you are trying to "get away"
with paying less than you know it is worth. You don't "get away" with
good deeds, only bad ones. It has nothing to do with backbone. It has
everything to do with treating priestly services more like just that
and less like a business, keeping with the spirit of roleplaying.

Offering 2pp is fine. Just do it before the port so the porter has an
opportunity to decline. If it's pretty apparent that it's all you can
afford, chances are you will still get the port. If you can afford it,
there is no reason you shouldn't be willing to pay it.

Sounds like porter envy to me. "My class is forced to pay you for it
so I'm going to act like it's not worth much to me to justify not
paying much." If the going rate offends you so, there is always the
option of walking. Make a statement. Stand up for your own beliefs.

I'm not against that at all, but I doubt it will happen.

Please. Everyone knows what to expect if they ask a porter how much
and it is *not* 2pp or less.
