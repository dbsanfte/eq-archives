Same here but I'm not sure he will. Can't imagine anyone here plays
PS2 EQ. Probably he be better off trying a dedicated PS2 EQ2 forum. Not
been there for a while but the GamesFAQ ones where well used. Same for
IGN and Gamespot boards.

Don't think they'll be WebTv friendly though, so a trip to your local
internet cafe would be in order.
