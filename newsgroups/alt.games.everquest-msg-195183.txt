One of our newer ( 56 ) clerics loves to Melee, as evidenced by his style 
while we were exploring in deep velks last night.  He'll love to hear this.

Anyone know if the warder is mezzable?

Hrm, I think I'll get in on the Warder Smacking with my dagger that procs -
vs- summoned I looted from my first ever Naggy raid.

I don't know if we'll even try to slow him, with all the healing power our 
guild is able to muster.

It will probably be 10-14 people, mostly 55, some higher.  Fun!

It's sickeningly easy.  The Gator in The Swamp was a blast, though.  Since 
he was underwater, we casters were in the water and tried to cast on him, 
to no avail ( between getting whirled to death ).  Finally, one of the 2 
Wizards got on land and was able to nuke it, so we got our feet dry and 
finished him off.  For a while there, we though we were going to lose the 
battle because of the AOE ( AOE = no DPS ).  It was still fun as shit, 
though.  I wasn't wearing my resist gear.  Bad me.

Someone in the guild saw another guild pull him to dry land, but wasn't 
quite sure how they did it.  He thinks they nuked it with a Lure, although 
I would think the Wiz would get summoned if that happened.

Thanks, Mon.
