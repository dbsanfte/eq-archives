Hey there

Well I'm a newbie to EQ - only started it the other day, but I've got a new
lv 5 char going.  Anyways, I've just tried to play, and the patch files
downloaded fine.  But the moment I click 'play online' it just quits back to
desktop.  I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling EQ and DX7 and 8 (and my
video drivers) which has not fixed the problem.  I've had a flick though the
forums on different sites, and can't find the solution either.  Anyone got
any hints?

The text from dbg.txt are as follows:

[Wed May 30 11:15:39 2001]00000:Unable to load EQGfx_Dx7.DLL (1157)

[Wed May 30 11:15:39 2001]00000:Failed to load graphics DLL in WinMain(),
exiting!

I couldn't find that referenced file anywhere on my system, or on my Ruins
of Kunark EQ CD.  Copying a file into the dir, and naming it EQGfx_Dx7.dll
produced the following bug report:

[Wed May 30 11:27:38 2001]00000:GFXDLL: Unable to GetProcAddress for
GetDataAddresses

[Wed May 30 11:27:38 2001]00000:Failed to load graphics DLL in WinMain(),
exiting!

Which shows it found the file, but (obviously) it didn't work.

Anyone know where this file comes from?  Before the patch EQ worked just
fine.

My system is:

P3 800
128MB RAM
Win ME
Creative GF 2 mx, detonator drivers

EQ Ruins of Kunark - patched to latest version.

Thanks
