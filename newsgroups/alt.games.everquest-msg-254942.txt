My son wants to start playing Everquest.  He's 14 so I don't have a 
problem with it.

  However, my thought is the PC version would be better.  But the PS2 
version's media is lots less.

  Is the PC version more detailed?  Can PC players play with PS2 
players?

  I searched deja but couldn't find a comparison.

  Thanks.
