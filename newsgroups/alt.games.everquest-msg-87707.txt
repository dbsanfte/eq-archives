What is the point of shouting it "in game" other then to be an
annoying putz and throwing a tantrums like a 5 year old. It's the same
as people who shout and scream if there aren't enough checkers or
because they didn't get to the store on time before closing and pound
on the door, whining. It's all about context and social graces. There
are more appropriate places for that talk. Plus, "it's a game loser,
get over it and log out." That's what I would have been thinking as a
player in his zone, I just wouldn't "shoot my wad" like him. It's
called impulse control.

As for the GM, It's not the content as much as his behavior. I
understand (correct me somebody) that GMs do have player files with
names of players who have come to the attention of GMs for good and
bad behavior. Depending on the mood of the GM, he might have made a
note about the players attitude. In itself, it would mean nothing,
unless the person was embroiled in some controversy in-game, then it
and other possible past "bad" behaviors would be used to determine if
this is merely a case of a player making a mistake or being his usual
"anti-social" self; in other words it can establish a players
pathology. Best of all, it can really help you to decide issues of He
said versus He said. An entry good or bad might be the deciding factor
when there is no evidence in a player dispute.
