Are you counting Bards or Beastlords as your "third slower"? 

Or Necromancers? 

Mages maybe?  Don't we eventually get a summoned only slow?

Beastlords, as I understand it get a halfway decent slow only at
the highest end of the game, prior to that its similar to the
bard one, a running joke.  I could be surprised, of course.  

While I thought that the slow rate was reasonably similar, a
recent thread pointed out that a 10% difference in slow percent
was really a much larger difference in damage mitigated via the
slow.  This being the case, Enchanter slow is (over most of their
career) inferior to shaman but still in the running, but
beastlord slow is even worse, and bard slow causes baby jesus to
get the hiccups laughing into his holy grail of bosco.

Still, three slowers would work better for my logic, which would
then make three plate tanks, three slowers, three mezzers, three
healers, and seven DPS casters; a preponderance of DPS people but
sharing two slots in most groups, instead of one each as the
other classes compete for.
