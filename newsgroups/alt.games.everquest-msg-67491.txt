    That's going to be a cool fight. The Avatar of Fear's room is one of the
first "experiences" I remember in EQ where it was just cool to be there.

    The spawns in the water can be clerics, and can be melee mobs. One of
the tricks to doing AoF is killing the pond spawns until they're all
non-clerics, then leaving them alone. Unless you're really low level, they
won't add (although they would heal).

    Roughly. Might be more with the SK upgrades. A Rune before combat should
handle this, if he's up when you get there. When waiting on him later,
remember that his aggro radius fills that room he's in, so have everyone in
the room be sitting (not just casters), with the person you want to eat the
HT closer to the sphere than everyone else.

>4) Has a lizzie PH
>5) Drops either the claws ( which you will see ) or the BP

    If he has claws (common drop) he'll be a blender of attacks. Given that
he has higher-than-normal MR, at your level slowing may not be an option. If
you find you aren't landing slow (or don't want to die trying),
chain-casting Berserker STR on the tank is a reasonably low-aggro way to
contribute to the fight.
