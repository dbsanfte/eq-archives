Lately, since I've been 2Boxing on one box, I turned off the dynamic
lighting to save some clock cycles. I found that the world looks a lot
better now, and those light stones brighten everything you can see. (I
hated seeing the really stupidligting effect too. You didn't light up
something 5 feet in front of you, but this triangle that goes 50 feet
to your left is lit up like day. Now it uses a standard lighting for
each zone, which looks a lot better.) However something right next to
you won't be as bright as it would be with the dynamics on. Also you
can't use the old trick for finding wisps, firebeatles, your corpse,
or other players, like you can with dynamics.
