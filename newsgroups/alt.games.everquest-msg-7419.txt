I picked up a Silvery War Axe for 100pp in EC then waited around for
about 30 minutes to see what else I could pick up. Nothing caught my
eye so I headed out to meet a group in HighPass Hold and saw "WTS
sharkbone cutlass - 100pp" as I zoned to West Commons.. ARRRGH! Zoned
back in but it was already sold. :(

Oh well. I've been practicing up my much neglected 1HS with the
Silvery War Axe and Shiny Brass Shield while our group is camping for
a PGT. If we don't get one in a couple of nights I'll head back to EC
or Greater Faydark and see if I can't pick up the claws or crystal
fiber. Then it'll be time to practice dual wield. :)  

I'm still kicking myself for neglecting my 1HS but that Nathsar
Greatsword was/is a kickass 2-hander.  It's nice hitting for 28-30
while still under the damage cap. (level 18)

thanks for the suggestions

Scott
