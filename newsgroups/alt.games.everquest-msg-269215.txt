Not a flaw, necessarily, but I see an even simpler test.

As I read it, the theory being tested is that the client applies
mana (and hp) regen at the tick, but the server applies it on a
finer level (possibly 1/10 second), and that you can see the
difference by forcing the client to sync with the server.

So, how's this for an experiment to test the theory?  Get rid of
your mana regen items/buffs (so the percentage difference between
sitting and standing mana regen is larger), and burn your mana bar
down to roughly zero (doesn't have to be exact).  Now do the dance,
sitting only for the tick and standing as much as possible.  (A
hotkey and a simple macro tool such as the ranger Autofire hack
can help get the timing right.)  Watch your mana number and verify
that the client is telling you you're getting sitting regen at each
tick.  Once you've gotten a large amount of mana back (say, 1000 or
more), cast a fast 5-mana spell to force a resync, and see what
happens to your mana total.

If the theory is correct, you'd expect your mana to drop a lot when
you cast the spell, as the server informs your client of the true
mana number given that you weren't really sitting all that time.
