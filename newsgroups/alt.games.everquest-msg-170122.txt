Works as in you get your luclin model and the horse effects, without seeing the horse?

If thats accurate, can you describe which horse effects you get this way?  Do you get the movement
speed, the meditation, the lack of sit aggro, the high safe fall "skill"?

Or works as in "I don't use a horse, so SOL model for my race/gender on, and Horse/Elemental off
works just fine"?
