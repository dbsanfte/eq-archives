Hmmm.... finally got Dyllin Starsine on his own, in the smuggler's cave in
Highhold Pass, without half of Norrath camping him and he didn't drop page
30, just some Bayle List III that I am not interested in. He represented a
trivial challenge (see how long I had to wait to find him uncamped) and I
wondered if anyone could confirm, for sure, whether that is the reason he
didn't drop page 30 (then, why would he have cash on him and the other
thingy?) or whether it is worth going back again and trying.
