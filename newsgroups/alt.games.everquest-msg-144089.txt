Playing a cleric, now level 39. At 30, or maybe a little later, I picked
alteration to specialize in. In my skills list now, "specialization:
Alteration" is at the same 50 points it started at. Obviously, I've cast
many heals as I've advanced through the 30s, and my regular Alterations
skill has advanced as you'd expect (it's in the 190s now).

So, how come the specialization hasn't advanced at all as my regular
alteration skill has?

And, how much impact can this specialization skill have, anyhow? I'm not
even real clear on its specific practical benefit. Anybody know of an FAQ I
could read on it?
