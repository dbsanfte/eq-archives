    I will truly miss EQ; the entertainment it gave me in the beginning was 
truly something special, but alas things are so different nowadays that EQ has 
already been dead to me for quite some time.

    Anyway, what I loved about EQ early on was playing (dealing) with other 
real people, and since all the expansions; well it feels not so much 
multiplayer anymore.  I am going to turn off the new graphics and play a little 
bit over the Easter holiday, probably bring dwarf Ratnik (created 3rd day live) 
to tour ButcherBlock in remembrance, then shut off the account. I would have 
let EQ ride for $9.89 but the rate increase is not acceptable at this point.

    Shadowbane any good???
