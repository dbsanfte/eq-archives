BPL is the suxxor.

<ehm>
Really, BPL is not very viable. The major problem is that the Power company
is going to have to go pole to pole, put up regenerators, links, etc. Then
once it's all laid out, they have to go BACK to each pole and fix all the
leaky insulators, cracked grounding capacitors, bad lightning arrestors,
semi-opens and near shorts, tap coils, mistuned transformers, etc...

That is a monsterous investment. It's not just put something in at the
switching station and the plug something in your wall.

Also, they are going to be limited to 'part 15' FCC regs, which means they
are not allowed to cause interference to licensed spectrum users, which
include Shortwave broadcast, Ham radio, CB (well.. ok AUTHORIZED users...),
Military, Civil Air Patrol, Aviation control, etc...

Part of the 'interference mitigation' is detecting and removing from use
frequencies that it detects other signals on. Which means every time the
local ham radio guy keys up, he blasts a small chunk of bandwidth away. And
it's legit, because he has the right of way. That means the CB'er down the
street which the FCC wants to ignore and who splatters all over from 10m-12m
is going to take out prime wire real estate as well. As far as  frequency
was concerned, they would have been much better to get a VHF tv channel or
two that's not used in the area, which is about the same bandwidth as the
monsterous chunk of the HF spectrum they are covering. They would have had
to pay a little for it, but they won't have Hams and SW listeners lined up
at the doors to the FCC dropping complaints on them left and right. And VHF
would not have the propagation issues HF does (On a good night, you would be
able to hear the BPL hash from New York in Moscow...)

Ok I'm sorry, I'll shut up now. (the 'BPL holy grail' is one of my personal
dislikes, right up there with 'dude cn u cm 2 pon nd kei us' questions
directed at my enchanter while I'm in lower guk or something... and 55th.)

Disclaimer: I'm a ham radio operator and SWL. And work for an ISP. We looked
at this objectivly with one of the local power companies. during said
discussions I said not word 2 about interference with hf issues. I did
mention that with the way their system was setup, the local illegal CB bunch
(and we have lots of them.. FCC came in here and confiscated $50k worth of
illegal amps and radios in 3 weeks a couple of years ago, and it hasn't
slowed em down any) and the hams would knock out parts of bandwidth
regularly. The hardware people agreed, said it was supposed to be that way.
When we worked out all the costs, the power company decided it would be
cheaper just to run cable service out on the power poles themselves, and
less prone to trouble.
