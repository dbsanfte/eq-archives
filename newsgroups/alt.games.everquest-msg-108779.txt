If you have already learned the dual wield skill, by training a point in it
after reaching the required level, then you will be using both weapons.   The
dual wield skill will not work very well at first, but as you gain more levels
and more skill, you will get to the point where each hand attacks at the same
time pretty often.

The key word there is eventually.   You cannot use Dual Weild until you have
trained the skill.  The game will not allow you to equip a weapon in each hand
until you do have the skill.  I'd recommend getting a shield until you hit
level 17.
