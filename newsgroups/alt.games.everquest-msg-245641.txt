Resisted jolts do not give aggro, unless you are the first person to aggro
the mob.  I have turned mobs back to whoever is tanking even with a resist.

Yes, it is not hard to ditch aggro, but if you used jolt you would never get
it to start with (rogues dont just evade when they actualy have aggro ya
know).

Dont get aggro to start with :P There are other uses for it also.  Right now
I use it mainly as a pulling tool.

Huh? You want him to take aggro? Whats your point? I used to have to jolt
after snaring (especially if resisted a couple of times).

Jolt is also handy if duo-ing with a cleric and you want him to tank.
