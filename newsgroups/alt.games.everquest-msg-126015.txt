    Level 58. =)

    Caster's Realm and/or a spell parse site, like Lucy. Much of it is
gained through use - you see what your HPs are with Khura's, PotG and Marzin
instead of Aegolism and Blessed Armor of the Risen, nod, and go "OK". When
you get obsessive/compulsive about it like me, you can tell exactly what
buffs are on you based on what your stats are. Hope you don't get to that
stage. And some things you never really learn - I still can't recall how
many HPs my Remedy spell can heal, I just know it as my long range, crappy
heal.

    Guild leaders rarely know your spells better than you do. =)

    One more level to new spells! Have them in your backpacks? And how are
you enjoying the wonderful cash drops in the painfully-easy Brute caves?
