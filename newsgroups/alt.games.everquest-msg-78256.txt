If you buy the Trilogy pack, you will get EQ Classic, Kunark, and Velious
(but not Luclin).  If you find the Ruins of Kunark expansion, that will
include the original EQ as well.

If you buy Luclin, you get just that.... the Luclin expansion without the
basic EQ.  The Scars of Velious expansion by itself does not include the
original EQ, either.

IMHO, best bet is to buy the Trilogy pack, then if you like the game enough
to get past newbie stage, then get the Shadows of Luclin expansion.  IMO, if
you like the fantasy rpg genre, you will enjoy EQ enough to make it worth
while getting the Trilogy pack right off the bat.  If you have never played
fantasy role playing games before, then you may want to consider buying the
jeweled $10 basic EQ to see if it floats your boat before sinking any more
money into it.....
