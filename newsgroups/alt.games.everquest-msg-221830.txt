Of course you left out slow mitigation, the fact that the shaman spent
well over 100k getting his spells, the shaman 'nerfs' of having most
of their spells suddenly being a lot more expensive in terms of mana
when compared to another class (the only exception being DoTs and you

to get that cann5. 

Whine on, son.
