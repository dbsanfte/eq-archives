I pronounce it sow as in the pig (SoW, Sow), or ess oh double you (SOW), 
or sew (sow), based on the capitalization given.  Someone in game would 
be unable to tell which sound is in my head since all they see is 
text... unless they happen to use the same scheme I do.  But talking to 
RL friends about it I use them all interchangably...

Oddly, I don't (but should) have a different pronunciation for Shield of 
Words, if I'm spelling it one of the above ways, which I do to be 
annoying.  If I want to be clear its 'words or S'Words or something 
along those lines.

I also pronounce Spirit of Ox's abbreviation Socks, because that amuses 
me more than Ox or Sucks.
