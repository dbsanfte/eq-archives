I wont snip parts of your post as there was just too much to Manage there
Jeremiah :)  A good post it was, thank you for bringing some decent
arguments to this thread.

As for being able to work the tower.  I have never had any problem pulling
the tower since i started quadding in CS at lvl 51 in fact the lower i was
the easier it was.  At level 51 by running through and spamming my temperate
flux staff i could drag around 3 wyverns out of there without getting hit,
pulling one mob would aggro another two of them.  However at level 54 they
others do not aggro so to pull them i have to take a couple of hits while
targetting each one.  The tower is a non issue and whenever i find the
wyverns too overcamped that is where i head to pull.

Your math worked out to around 8 quads an hour which is probably about
right.....for level 51.  However you have to remember that i am talking
about at level 54 here.  at Level 51 i could not keep the 4 mob per 4 min up
over time.  Pillar of Frost is not the best of spells to be using on Wyverns
and the partial resists when using that spell on cold resist mobs can make
it much more inneficient. However i can manage around nearly twice as many
quads per hour at 54 using Pillar of Lighting, very rarely get resists and
it is more mana effecient than Pillar of Frost (my Wizard is 55 now so i
have moved onto quad kiting the othmir instead) At level 54 i do believe
that i can keep up the 4 mob per 4 min kill rate. But to be honest we are
arguing over a moot point here.  My original intention was just to show
people that Wizards were a good soloing class that under the right set of
circumstances can even out-solo a necromancer of equal level. (Not to
detract from a necros soloing ability at all, they are still the undisputed
soloing kings in my eyes)

You said you would have to level up a character to be able to survive the
trip to CS.  Thankfully Verant removed the need for the Keys to zone into CS
with SoL.  Therefore i could take an invised level 1 character there by
porting him directly if you would wish.

Now onto the "Wizards with low INT" remark.  Im sorry,  i took it the wrong
way, rereading your original post i can see that it was not intended to be a
malicous jibe. My apologies.
