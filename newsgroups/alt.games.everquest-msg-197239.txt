Torpor without any side effects

Krags Mending is the ICH.  Tnarg's is a 1.2k heal in (3?) seconds

I cast Fo7 (group focus) at the start of the group. 2 or so hours later, I
re-mem it to renew focus.
Bih'li on the other hand, I cast often (mobs in PoE proc a dumb snare, which
of course overwrites the sow/atk)

At most I have 2 dots/nukes up (slots 6 and 7) - but your right, my shaman
never solos.  He also plays second fiddle to my monk (who has a hardon for
ATK) - so a lot of the buffs are focused around this

On a raid mob, spells 6 and 7 become chloroblast (small fast heal) and
malosini(a) - when I need to debuff and slow by myself
