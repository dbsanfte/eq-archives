The "counters" are indeed counters to the various bad random events that 
occur, but  ... they also act as "buffs" to enhance various aspects of the 
process. In beta there were separate buffs and counters but in release they 
chose to go with a consolidated model that allows you to use the same 
abilities in either context. When you see a random event occur, hit the 
corresponding icon to counter the effect. To enhance your crafting, use 
these icons pro-actively as the need arises.

The buffs all do different things and you really need to read them to 
understand what it is they do. Each one can be Examined and the description 
will tell you both what events it will counter, and what effect it will have 
pro-actively. In some cases, for example, a buff will increase the progress 
of your blue bar at the cost of more Power. In other cases, progress will 
come at the expense of your green bar (durability). There are lots of 
possibilities but they're all explained on the icon and really worth 
learning. I can virtually guarantee creation of certain pristine items by 
careful use of the respective buffs.
