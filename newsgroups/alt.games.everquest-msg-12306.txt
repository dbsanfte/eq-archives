The problem with these is that they basically duplicate things other
classes get.  To make Wizards more group friendly, we need something
that is not just a duplicate of what someone else does.  My ideas for
this will be given down below.

That's good, but I'd change it to basically just be a damage shield that
gives damage on attempts to hit, unlike current damage shields, which
only damage on actually hits.  The damage would have to be low.

This wouldn't be all that useful in XP fights, but against low greens, where
normal damage shields are often useless because the mob never hits, it
would be nice.  All those stupid skeletons that aggro when we run
through newbie areas would drop dead for us!

Yup...already the domain on Enchanters.

There are already good stunning classes.

This would make Wizards very popular in groups when a new expansion is
added, or a dungeon is revamped.  However, after a couple of weeks,
people will already know all this.  Might as well just give Wizards a
spell that opens an embedded web browser in the target's client, and let
them go look it up. :-)

Don't Enchanters have mana drain spells?

Here are my ideas for things they could that would expand the role of
Wizards in groups without duplicating what other classes do.

1. Turn Eye of Zomm into a scouting tool.  It should work like this:

	a. If it aggros something, they kill the eye, and are perhaps
	in a heightened state of awareness for a while, but they do
	NOT come running straight for the Wizard.

	b. When the Eye spell runs out, the Eye does not go away, but
	just loses the ability to move.  It can still turn.

	With these changes, the Eye no longer is a pulling tool, but
	it becomes a somewhat useful scouting and guarding tool.

2. Magical stat buffs.  Enchanter have INT/WIS buffs, and mana regen
buffs.  Give Wizards buffs for the other things that affect magic.
E.g., buffs that raise specialization, channeling, evocation, etc.

2. Buffs to increase efficiency of other casters.  For instance, there
could be a buff that speeds casting, so the Cleric can get CH off
in 8 seconds instead of 10.

3. Buffs to make the spells of others more effective.  For example,
the Wizard could cast a spell on you, and that adds some time to the
timers on all or some of the buffs on you.  A Wizard can't SOW you or
give you Clarity, but if you have SOW or Clarity, the Wizard could make
it last longer.  Or perhaps this would be cast on other casters, and
then when they cast buffs, those buffs last longer.

4. Buffs to boost your effective spell level.  Cast this on someone, and
any spells they cast act as if the caster was 5 levels higher.  A level
30 Druid, buffed by a Wizard, would cast level 35 SOW, for example.
Perhaps this could even go so far as letting you scribe spells from the
next spell circle and cast them while the buff is in effect.  E.g., a 35
Cleric could scribe and cast CH while under the effect of this buff.
