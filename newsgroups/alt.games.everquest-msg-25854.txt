Here ya go. paying for this is a complete burn, so if ya need repost just
ask.
It works, but will take a long time to make any real money, and by the time
you get into the 20's you can make more adventuring than with this lame
guide.


(please read the entire guide before beginning)

Okay, as stated in the auction and on the website you must have an expansion
(Velious) to do this...

If you are going to use a current character

How much charisma do you have? If it is 110 or higher, you can start now. If
it is not, you might want to buy some +charisma items or use a new
character.

There are tons of +charisma items, but they can be expensive.  The higher
your charisma, the more money you make. There is a rumor that charisma
effect caps for enchanters near 140 or so. I have NOT found this to be true
- it doesn't make any sense either since charisma is most important to
enchanters.

Okay, if you have your charisma as high as you can get it, follow the
instructions in the next description!

Creating a new character

Create a high elf enchanter and put his Charisma at 115.

If you want, level your character to level four - I went to the area just
before the docks in Butcherblock mountains and leveled to 5 in a few hours -
and put 20 points into baking and then purchase your gate, illusion: human,
invisibility, and true north spells. If you can afford it, buy all your buff
and healing spells too. If you want to level further (not necessary) you can
purchase bind sight and illusion gnome at level 8 and bind affinity and
illusion: dwarf at level 12.  You can only put 21 skill points into baking.


Remember, you DO NOT HAVE TO LEVEL. This will work just fine at level 1! 
Now you need to go to Freeport, which is really easy from your starting
point of Felwithe. Outside of the city (greater fay) head west along the
trail to the Butcherblock Mountains zone. In Butcherblock, if you are level
one, follow the trail to the first break and take the northern turn. Then
follow the trail past kaladim to the docks. Take the northern dock for the
boat to Freeport. You'll land in East Freeport, go to Trader's Holiday and
buy a spit. Then go to West Freeport and get a bind (or use the spell if you
have it).

In West Freeport, you are going to need to spend some money. If you have
very little, go kill some stuff outside the gate (towards the East
Commonlands). You will need to eventually buy 7 backpacks (they are sold in
North Freeport at the paladin guild - you can raise the money for this
quickly enough - don't worry - read on). In West Freeport at the Academy of
Arcane Sciences buy batwings (buy as many as you can but leave two empty
slots in your inventory) - they will cost 1sp or less (depending on your
charisma - you can also raise your faction with some merchants buy using
illusion spells).
Once you have your batwings and spit head West to the East Commonlands zone.


Once in the zone, continue to head west to the first inn and buy frosting
from parthar in the hut on the right. Combine the frosting and batwings in
your spit to make batwing crunchies. You can sell these for a 1sp profit,
but you are really just raising your ability in baking right now. If you run
out of batwings, there is another merchant at the last inn (hut on right)
before the West Commonlands zone that sells them as well - be careful
heading to this vendor. Batwing Crunchies will trivial at 46.

(Trivial means that your skill will no longer rise doing this activity.)

Once you have Batwing Crunchies at trivial, sell the remaining supplies (you
can sell them at cost to the vendor at the first inn if you use your
illusion human spell) or use them up and sell the crunchies for profit (you
should be successful between 60% - 70%). Purchase as many jug of sauces as
you can from the vendor where you bought the frosting (leaving at least two
empty spots this time - the empty slots are for putting your successful
creations and you'll need 2 this time because the next recipe makes twice as
much). Now head to the docks in East Freeport and buy fish (they should be
2sp6cp, but the recent patch changed many fish facts) from the vendors in
the building leading to the dock. You will now make fish fillets by
combining fish and jug of sauces in your spit. Continue this process until
you trivial fish fillets at 82. Fish fillets used to make a 7sp profit, but
this has been changed and you might actually lose a little money.

Now combine fish and batwings to make fish rolls. This doesn't make profit
anymore either, but it will make you a master baker! Continue to make fish
rolls until you have trivialed it at 135.

This used to be the essence of the old guide, making profit by baking with
fish.  However, verant didn't want you to make a profit no matter how hard
you worked (it took work) and they nerfed the process.  In an interview
posted on http://eq.castersrealm.com (7/11) they said they didn't like
people using fish to fund the mastery of other skills.

Creating a new character in Halas

Same process except that if you go to Halas you can buy fresh fish at the
pier and jugs of sauces at mc'daniels smokes and spirits from the last
merchant upstairs, sissia. There is an oven to the left of the door of the
store and since the town is so small trips are really short.

Also when you get bored you can go to everfrost and kill mammoths (at the
appropriate level) which is always fun and profitable. You can make mammoth
steaks with mammoth meat, spices and jugs of sauce. What's great about
mammoth steak is that it makes 5 units per attempt and it's really worth
while if you can (highest profit margin in the game). Sometimes people sell
the meat to a vendor anyway or just don't loot it, so you can sometimes buy
it cheap in large quantities or scavenge it from abandoned corpses, at any
rate you should try it its fun.

Scars of Velious expansion

Ok, now you are a master baker and you need to head into Velious.  If you
can get a port to Iceclad, that is a great time saver.  However, this guide
assumes you have to run.  If you are not level four yet, I highly recommend
it. My brother made this trip with a SoW at level 2 in one try, but he is
really lucky. I made the trip at level 5 by using my Invisibility spell. Oh
yeah, go anonymous (/anon) or the 40+lvl characters will make fun of you...
:)

Before you make this trip, make as much money as possible (at least a couple
plat, make batwing crunchies if you have to) and put EVERYTHING in the bank.
If you die en route, forget your corpse and start over.

I recommend downloading the maps of these zones from
www.eqatlas.com/atlas.html.

Head to the Northern Desert of Ro by heading south from East Freeport. 
Continue south until you reach the desert and the head for the shore (on
your left). Follow the shore to the first dock (with a pirate). This skiff
will take you to Velious. Once you see the little Island, jump off the skiff
and swim to the shore. Once on the shore, cast invisibility if you have it.
(Watch this spell carefully - if it starts blinking near a frost giant, you
are doomed!!) Now run across the island (I saw only merchants when I was
there) and go to the huge dock on the opposite side of the island. This boat
will take you to another island.  Upon landing you are gonna want to run
along the shore (stay as close to the water as possible) there are three
islands connected by two "ice bridges" of floating ice - you'll see what I
mean. At the end of the third island is a real bridge guarded by two frost
giants. If you are invisible, they can't see you - also you can go around
them. Once on the bridge, you will zone.

Once you zone to the Eastern Wastes, I highly recommend jumping off the
bridge into the water. It is a really long way to fall and lots of fun.
Plus, how many level one enchanters get to jump off bridges and float
forever on your way down in a 35+ level zone? (I am posting the screenshots
from my jump at www.retrogamesncollectibles.com/screens.html.) Ok, enough
fooling around, now swim to the shore and head north. Once you hit the
invisible wall, follow it until you zone again.

Ok, this is the scariest part of the trip!! Follow the zone wall north until
you see a waterfall (say hello to the frost giants for me). Walk through the
waterfall and you will zone into the city of Thurgadin. Head north until you
see the Broken Glacier store in front of you, turn left and the bank is on
your right. Also, there are merchants selling all your baking and other
supplies.

Now, get your 7 backpacks and your spit. Come out of the bank and head back
towards the entrance, keep going until you see Mordin's Meats on your left.
Here you want to buy gator meat. Combine gator meat with jug of sauces and
vinegar from vendor in bank in your spit to make pickled gator. You will get
two jars of pickled gator every successful attempt.

Ok, it costs 3sp in supplies to create the pickled gator.  You can resell
the pickled gator for 6sp6cp.  That is more than a 100% profit!  By using 10
slot bags (have been told you can buy 10 slot boxes in iceclad) and using
the oven in mordins meats instead of the spit.  You can easily make more
than 72pp an hour.  I was making 72pp an hour with only 8 slot backpacks.

---------------------------------------------------- 
1. If you can find 10 spot weight reducing backpacks, you will be less
encumbered.
2. Remember that you can select an entire stack of items by holding down
shift (for selling, buying, moving) and you can select just one from a stack
by holding down control.
3. If you have trouble locating any baking supplies, you can find the
locations for frosting, fish, batwings, etc at this link.
www.eqtraders.com/location/baking.htm.
4. Sometimes vendors say they are busy - this usually means they've been
attacked. Sometimes vendors are missing - this usually means they've been
killed. J  These glitches are usually fixed with the next spawn.
