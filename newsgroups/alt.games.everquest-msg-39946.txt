Does experience loss differ if youre a different charecter? example: if you
were level 35 druid, would you lose the same amount of exp if u were 35 warrior
and got killed? Or does that differ?

Also...is there a chart of how much exp u lose at each level?
And if you just got to level 35, and got killed when u had 1/10th a bar of blue
exp, would u lose the same amount of exp if u were torwards the end of level 35
and had like  4 and a half gold bubbles?

Just curious
