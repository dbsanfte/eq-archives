    For most areas of the game, this, yes. Too much variability in things
like this just turns things that could be fun into pure timesink.

    No. This is very non-dynamic, and doesn't mesh well with a game with the
"camp out" mechanism EQ has. Camp back into the Inn, and get insta-killed by
dark elves that weren't there and which you had no warning would be there
when you camped out? Is that fun?

    This I do like as a feature for specific zones. Note that some zones
already have a weak form of this in that multiple creature types share a
spawn table. So, for example, in East Karana if you're killing the spiders
you will start to see more snakes and lions due to the mixed respawn table.
But yes, as a feature in specific places it works well.

    EQ has yet to get this to work well. Hollowshade is usually broken, and
this means that anything that depends on items dropping from one side of the
conflict is also broken. So you're stuck with either having broken content,
or having content that only depends on itself (and thus can be ignored). As
a triggered event, wars are great. But as a continuous event, it usually
ends up broken.

    It has to be limited. Part of the fun in EQ is in "solving" something,
whether it be a quest, or a pulling strategy, or a tradeskill recipe. The
reward for spending time figuring out the puzzle is usually being able to
farm the puzzle for items, XP, or faction. Having ever-changing puzzles that
cannot be farmed would only encourage players to seek out puzzles that never
change and farm them, for the higher reward vs. time ratio.

    You also get into content issues. You not only have to develop a lot of
content, you also have to do a lot of changing or eliminating of old
content. Devs are pressed to do as much as they do now, asking for MORE
isn't going to get the best quality (like we get that now, ha ha).
