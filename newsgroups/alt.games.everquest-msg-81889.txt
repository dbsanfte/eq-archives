Speaking as somebody who spends a lot of time there, and has raided
basically to the bottom, you might be a bit ....... optomistic in your
expectations. Your warrior is about the right level to start camping the
entry, where the lowest level mobs are. But the amount of healing he can
expect from you and a bard is...... dubious. Particularly until you
learn how to single pull there. A couple of elemental warriors at once,
and the bard will be so busy *trying* to keep one mezzed, and you'll be
flushing every bit of many you have into healing the warrior, that he'll
likely be trying to solo it. You could give it a shot, and I admire your
ambition, and it certainly *might* work, but I think you'll definitely
be pushing the envelope. I'd get a couple more people for melee at your
levels, or at least a cleric to do that. Pretty easy to get chewed up in
there. At 54 I can *BARELY* solo one of them with no healing.

As to "underused", yes, the Hole is still a fairly low population zone,
due to the difficulties in getting a key, remote location, and lack of
general knowledge about it by a lot of players. But since the SoL spires
made getting there a joke, I'm seeing more people there lately. (Sadly.
Used to be almost a private hunting ground for a few groups on our
server. Heh.)

Good luck. Remember, try to pull the mobs to the skinny aisle near the
water to fight them, right where you climb out after zoning in. And be
ready to snare every time when they run. They can send back a lot of
friends fast.
