Rogues have poor damage mitigation and do a substantial portion of their
damage via backstab, which requires they be in the rear arc of the
target.  This combination means that they are probably the worst solo
class in the game, although that isn't to say you can't solo one to 60 if
you really want to.

On the other hand, when position allows, they have some of the highest
sustained damage production in the game, grouped, this is their principle
role; kill the target faster.

Rogues also have an unparalleled ability to move thru all but a few see
invis mobs at will, at the cost of some movement speed.  This means they
are great at pulling dead bodies out of bad places.   Since dying is to
be avoided, this isn't really as important as it seems.

Best race... whatever you like.  Really not much difference by and large,
by the time stats matter, you'll have access to stats buffs to fix
whatever weaknesses you have.  Perhaps barbarian, with the highest
stamina, general rule for most classes, HP matters more than almost
anything.

Best hunting grounds... whereever you can find a group.  This is the
opposite of many classes, where the best area is wherever other people
aren't.  Best hunting grounds in the game, of course, are Paladul
Caverns, so perhaps Beastlord would have been best choice for a rogue,
pre POP, but now anyone can easily get anywhere.
