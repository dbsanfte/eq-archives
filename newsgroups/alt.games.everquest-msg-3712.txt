Most camps are such that the monster you need (or his placeholder) spawns
every X minutes, where "X" is a constant for that particular spawn site.
Find out the respawn time (either by looking it up on a website, or
just time two successive spawns), and then you can easily use a kitchen
timer to alert you when the next one is about to pop -- in between
times, you're free to do whatever else you'd like (mostly RL stuff,
since most in-game activities would take you away from the camp and
you'd lose your "place").

Also, after playing EQ for several months, it's a RELIEF to do
something slow and mindless in the game and still (hopefully) get
something to show for it.  At times it's relaxing to do the
"sit and wait at the camp" routine as a break from the "must
pay attention every second or I might get my butt killed" situation
that makes up the bulk of EQ (or even the "must navigate my character
with vigilance every moment I'm traveling across several zones
lest I run off a cliff or trip over a Griffin" situation that makes
travel in the game less than soothing as well).

So for a change of pace, the prospect of "if I sit on my ass long
enough, I'll get a cool item" can start to sound attractive.
Eventually, of course, that then becomes more of a drag than
the thought of risking your life and having to be on guard every
second, and it's then time to switch back to "action" playstyle.
But it's the ability to decide what you're in the mood for at
any given time, and then have the option to DO it, that keeps he
game continually fresh and not a monotonous grind of the "same
old, same old".
