Hey, I'm one of these people who should be shot if I risk having kids.
I just happen to have a face in these parts.

And, for every single person you think shouldn't have children, it is
a subject close to heart. Your problem is that none of them have
faces, so you can just lump them together and forget that they're
humans, too.

And rest assured, I've spent half a decade and counting debating
whether or not I'll ever risk a pregnancy. Heck, my kid could get my
150+ IQ instead of my sister's ailments. So, should I try to give the
world bright minds, or should I avoid more people needing care 24
hours a day? There ARE many factors in such a decision beyond looking
for possible bad genetics.

Now, talk about HIV positive people who knowingly have unprotected sex
with unknowing partners instead, and then we can discuss shooting.
