Point Blank.

Just FYI, biz, when Monual first attempted to use his PBAOE's while farming 
Hollowshade Moor for smithing drops, I went through the same process you 
did - convinced these spells weren't working.  After all, when I nuked 
myself I did no damage, it must be broked!  Fortunately a wizard in my guild 
walked me through how to use them.

Wolfie's suggestion is a good one: surround yourself with a buncha greenies 
and cast the spell.  You'll still take no damage, but closeby mobs will all 
get hit.

The PB in PBAOE is quite literal; the mobs practically have to be quite 
close *and* you have to be completely still.  It doesn't matter who you have 
targeted; the AOE is centered on *you*.  That why you never got an "out of 
range" message, because you are never out of range of yourself.  =)

Bards used to be soloing gods because they could cast PBAOE's *while 
moving*.  SOE eventually nerfed that.
