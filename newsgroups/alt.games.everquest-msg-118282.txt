Here's a quick one you can knock out with one *solid* group of folks
your level or slightly above. (At an average level of 54 we did this
with one warrior, one cleric, and one druid, though it was a LONG ass
fight. I think you can handle it.)  In the tunnels in GD that lead to
the crystaline shardwurm caves is named wurm. (Vuludeen, or something
close to that. Not looking it up right now, but you can't miss her if
she's up.) Pull her out of the caves to the south side and take her
down. She drops her tail almost every time, and it's a whip with
something like +20 Cold Resist. Crappy whip, but GREAT piece of resist
gear for Vox. I still have one in the bank.
