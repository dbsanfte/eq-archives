And this makes it ok for DAOC to release the game before it was ready?  How?

Don't make comparisons between this and other games.  It's a moot
comparison.  ALL games should be ready for prime-time when released. My
bitch is that DAOC is YET ANOTHER game that we're paying to beta, NOT that
it's worse or better than EQ.  Because, quite frankly, I don't give a shit
if its start is better or worse than EQs.
