Hardly, poorly written deregulation laws were the cause here in
California. Had nothing to do with "tree huggers". Right and Left
signed off on a poorly written law. In the end it was the power
companies and related energy industries who had their say in the
writing process that did it to us, but it should be noted they did
nothing illegal, blame your representative in Sacramento who signed
off on the law.
