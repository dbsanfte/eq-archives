Your news provider is indirectly in control of this. I say indirectly
because nobody there is willfully deleting posts, they just happen to
expire at a certain rate, which is determined by how efficient their
software is, and how large a database of backlogged posts they are willing
to maintain.

There is no individual, or identifiable group of people who have any
control over the subject of any post in any usenet group, unless that group
is moderated. This one is not.

That is why there are killfiles.
