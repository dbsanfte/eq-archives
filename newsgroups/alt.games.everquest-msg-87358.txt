Yeah, I know.  I was commenting on the fact that sometimes their
definition of an "exploit" trods all over a well-thought out tactic.   Take
the
AoE's not working around corners...

Guess what, if you hide behind a concrete bunker (around a corner, as
it was), a grenade won't hurt you, either.  What kind of idiot in any
fantasy
novel is going to stand right in the middle of a giant AoE spell when
he can "dive for cover?"

And to me, fighting Dain in the Well is the _perfect_ place to fight him.
Kind of like fighting a gating mob on it's spawn-point :-).
