My normal group (made up of my guildmates that are all real world friends,
with a few good online friends thrown in for spice) usually consists of  a
High Elf Enchantress, Dark Elf Necro, Dwarven Warrior, WoodElf Druid, Human
Mage, WoodElf Ranger, and Human Monk (myself). We also have a Dwarven Cleric
that swaps out with the Druid sometimes, but he recently moved and is in the
process of more mundane matters, like finding a job :)

Mainly we just have a good time playing together, even though from all I've
read our little band isn't anywhere near the ideal makeup for a group. It's
still never hurt us up to this point though... and I'd have to say that in
most situations we flat out kick ass so far. I can already tell that Dalnir
will be the "real" test though :)
