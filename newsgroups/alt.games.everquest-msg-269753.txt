If you just want to try other classes, in Final Fantasy one character 
can be all jobs... in fact I ran into a jp player that explained, in 
broken english + translator, that he was leveling up his last job.. he 
had all others (18 total jobs I think) at least at 70. (cap 75) He was 
busy leveling Dragoon through the 30s.

Me, I can't concieve of that much time.
