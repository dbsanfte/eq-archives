Ah, duo quadding. an EXTREMELY effective way to do it. but requires a
lot coordination, and most non experienced players will shy away from
it, and prefer to do it solo.  I assume your druid friend knows the
basics: find four of the same type of mob (should be same so they run
the same speed), snare them, run in big circles get them packed and
cast Lightning Strike as fast as possible.

You don't have any spells to really help in the quad until 39, except
for clarity to help recover for next batch, since at 34 each quad will
prolly take every drop of his mana.   

When you get 39, goto Katta Castellum and buy "gravity flux", or try
and research it, either way. pick three landmarks, and both of you run
in a triangle to them. stand right on top of each other at each spot
and both nuke the ae's. Stay right beside each other and run to next
spot.

If you get seperated or one of you gets closer than the other to the
mobs, the mobs will break up and you are in trouble.  Well not bad
trouble, since you can mez, but still defeats the purpose.

At your current level, I would suggest kodiacs or tizmats in Great
Divide. you can ALWAYS find four to kill. Tiz are a little tougher,
since sometimes get a caster. Can't quad kite casting mobs :)
Let your druid friend kite them and you just hang on the side lines
and keep clarity flowing. Maybe single nukes (Anarachy?) towards the
end to finish them off.  Keep adds mezzes, and watch his back. 

But until you get gravity flux, you would just get in the way if try
and help.  

When my chanter was 52 or so, I would regularly quad with a druid,
excellent way to do it.
