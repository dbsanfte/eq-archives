Bards *never* get a "hide failed" message, even when it
does fail (which it does a lot).

To ask a silly question, do you have a wind instrument
equipped?  The invis song doesn't actually do anything
unless you've got a wind instrument in hand.

And for another dumb question, are you sure you've *charmed*
the mob?  Might you be trying to break a *mez* with invis
(which needless to say, doesn't work)?

Does the mob show up as your pet?  Look at your health
bar, if you have a little green line under it that's your
pet's health and you have charmed the mob as a pet.  If no
green line, the mob is not charmed.

Also, maybe you are breaking charm and no one can tell
because it's also mezzed (by you or someone in the group).
Use the "green line" test again to be sure.
