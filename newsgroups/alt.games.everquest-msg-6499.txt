And so, quit using "connotation" like it's an important word to your
argument.  It isn't.

Rape isn't a bad or evil word (it's only a word with many meanings).

Money is not the root of all evil, either (the love of it is)

The proof isn't in the pudding (it's in the tasting).

Guns don't kill people (either people do, or the bullets).

Very very few people die from falling off a tall building (they almost
always die by hitting the ground).
