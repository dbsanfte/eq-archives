There's a new feature in Everquest that lets a player include a
"link" to an item in any chat text so that other players who see
the text can click on the link to view the stats of the item.

It's possible to use this feature in an unexpected way to view the
stats of any item in the game.

You can create Socials keys which include these item links by
editing your character's .ini file.  For example, if you wanted
to make a hotkey to auction your Stein of Moggok, you could put
something like this in the [Socials] section of your character's
.ini file:

    [Socials]
    Page1Button1Name=Stein
    Page1Button1Color=0
    Page1Button1Line1=/auc WTS ^R0013380Stein of Moggok^R 150pp

The ^R is the special character that delimits these new item links.
It is an ASCII 18 (decimal).

The 0013380 is the decimal representation of the Stein of Moggok's
item number in the EverQuest item database.

You can discover an item's number if you have logging turned on
and you, or someone else, sends a link to the item.  The item
number will show up in your eqlog file.

When someone clicks on the "Stein of Moggok" text of your auction,
the stats of the Stein are displayed.

But of course there's nothing to stop us from using other item
numbers, even if we don't know what, if any, item they might be
associated with.

I've been exploring the item database this way.  With ten pages of
twelve five-line socials each, at five items per line, I can create
hotkeys to display links for 3000 items in a session.  Maybe not as
exciting as a Naggy raid, but I've been enjoying discovering items
I didn't know existed, and that may not even be in the game yet.
For example, I keep seeing items currently named "PoP Fingers"
which, as far as I know, won't be in the game until Planes of Power
is released.

Have fun exploring the item database!
