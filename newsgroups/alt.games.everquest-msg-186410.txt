From the shadows, the mysterious "Crash86" <crash86@shotmail.com> (if

That's how you get AC2.

They have less subscribers than some single EQ servers.

This isn't the same as your software company. The customers think they
know better, but they don't have any experience in mmorpgs either, and
have been quite frequently and decisively proven wrong over and over.

You weren't around for whineplay, were you?

I'll put it succinctly: you can't make the users happy. You can make
some of the users happy. And by doing so, you make others unhappy.

Your zero-sum logic does not work for the mmorpg playerbase. The
playerbase does not KNOW what it wants because everyone wants
different things.

And by doing so, alienate another part of the fanbase. You just can't
correct problems this way. It goes on and on. Your solution has
already been tried for mmorpgs, and it failed.

You feel free to yell BS and then run from providing evidence why?

Huh. Interesting.

The concept of an rpg is lost on you, apparently. You are what we call
a casual powergamer, basically the worst of bost worlds.

Yeah, there is, but you don't have the required mindset to see it. As
I said, my direction does not cater to the casual powergamer crowd
which now dominates mmorpgdom.

Strawman. It is not the fact you are a casual player that is the
problem, it is that you are only interested in maximizing your
advancement (in whichever area, tradeskills or exp) vs time ratio.

In a true rpg, in a *world*, when friends are across the world and
need to meet, it might well be a long harrowing journey. One shouldn't
need to see numbers rising or bars filling to feel they accomplished
something.

Then see above for why it's BS.

What makes you think they won't? Because YOU wouldn't like it?

I guess you'd be happy if every game parroted EQ in every way....

A common fallacy. YOU are not the sum of all end users.
