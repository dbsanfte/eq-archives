Actually no, you can also forest rare material which can be worth much more
to sell or use, here's a little tip, create another character and make them
for storing and crafting with the materials you find and cannot use on your
scholar, at least store as much as possible and then when you feel like
trying something different another day you got the stuff to play with, make
sure you supply your alt with a good assortment of storage like larger
boxes, bags are ok but cost more per container slot wise, just making a
bunch of boxes with your alt will pay for itself, and making the maple
quills and such your scholar will probably be needing to complete many
instance guild quests.
