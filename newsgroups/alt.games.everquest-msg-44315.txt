Not that I have noticed, but I haven't been playing much lately, I
started a new job on afternoon shift.  I have noticed some web pages
seem slower to load, but no noticable eq problems.  I have AT&T @home,
so not sure what if any affect that has on comparing speeds.  How many
people do you share your area with?  I usually only have three other
people on when looking at the Entire network.  I know cable is supposed
to slow down some with the more people logging on, but DSL wasn't
available to me.
