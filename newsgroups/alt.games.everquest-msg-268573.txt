I'm still on the fence on EQ2 versus WoW. Haven't decided which to buy yet, 
can't buy either till Dec 1.  I liked playing WoW during beta.  Only thing 
I didn't like was the looting lag bug.  Is that still around?  Someone on a 
forum says it was a few days ago.  That bug is enough to make me not want 
to pick up the game.

I also liked EQ2. Granted there was alot about EQ2 I didn't like but it's 
still a decent game.  I've put so much time into EQ in the last 4 years I'm 
not sure if I want to continue playing on Norrath or if I'd rather move on 
to a totally new universe.  I guess I gotta decide in a few days.
