I've seen accounts cancelled before of people stupid enough to, say,
advertise they were selling their account in-game. One guy thought he
was being clever by making a newbie on a different server from his
main characters to advertise. :p Also seen a few playerauction
accounts get nuked when the seller gave enough info for it to be
reported.
