My international treaty guy told me this:  The United States didn't sign it
because it put the greatest burden on us, as we use the most natural resources.
 It would have put many industries out of business due to the expense involved.
 He gave some reasons why he agreed with Bush not signing it, which I don't
recall, (but they WERE good arguments).
According to him Bush was going to come up with some kind of  "alternative
plan", someday.
(I didn't vote for Bush because I didn't like his environmental policy.  I
swear the man would raze  Yellowstone if he thought there would be a benefit
financially).
