FIND FRIENDS WHO DON'T LIE SO MUCH, HAR!!!!

Really "best" is subjective. They are all pretty mediocre and flawed
in different ways.

The current MMORPG market, after 5 years, is compareable to n64 mario
coming out and 5 years later everyone was making a game like n65 mario
while trying to be more successful than n64 mario (including n64 mario
itself.)

Its just really weird. No one has really made one yet that is worth
playing for a long haul, due to it being random or ever changing
enough.
