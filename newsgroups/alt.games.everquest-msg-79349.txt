Some races can go to all areas of Neriak, unless they do things to lower
theor faction.  Ogres and Trolls, for example.  Other races and classes can
gain access if they do a bit of faction work.  My gnome can go just about
anywhere in Neriak, as long as he avoids the Warrior's guild.

There are no "Drow" in EQ.  There are Tier'dal, also known as Dark Elves.

Dark elves start out KOS in most of the good cities.
