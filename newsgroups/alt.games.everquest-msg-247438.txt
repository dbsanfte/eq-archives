No it doesn't have to be a driver problem .. let's see ... your
motherboard has inbuilt graphics as well as an agp slot .. it is well
known that these boards have problems with add-on cards ... it is a Via
chipset which has to be one of the worst in the world .. continually
has problems with Graphics and sound solutions .. hell, have a look on
the Creative sites about problems with Via chipsets (btw you did use
their new 4 in 1 driver I suppose).

Blaming a graphics card for what in my opinion is a DX9 fault .. all of
the hallmarks including the message, point to a DX9 problem ... is just
plain wrong.  I would say the same thing if you were blaming an Nvidia
card for this particular problem.

Why does the Nvidia card work .. I have no idea it shouldn't with a DX9
fault ... but then again they don't implement DX9 properly so perhaps
that is the solution.

I do hope you have installed those Via drivers.
