Hmm, I've only done two LDoN so far, one I gated out (the only non gater
disbanded and ran out of the dungeon with all the loot) but the other I
followed the tanks to the exit area in case they ran into trouble (and one did
open a crate and spawn some trouble for himself), when I got there I first
thought I'd lost them, since they vanished, at any rate, it was a few moments
before I found there was a flat square like a trap door that I had to click on
to exit.  I guess if its possible to accidentally exit that there must be some
dungeons where there's a simple zone line?

Spendid
