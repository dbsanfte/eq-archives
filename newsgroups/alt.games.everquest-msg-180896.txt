I recently rolled up a new chanter (err .. newest, I should say ... as I've
taken four shots at getting a chanter into their teens and can't seem to
find the patience for it).  After taking no less than 20 shots at naming the
bastage, I took him to the Qeynos newb zone to begin the mass snake slaying.
There I saw a lvl 2 Barb Warrior who's name was "Nonrejectedname".

Classic.
