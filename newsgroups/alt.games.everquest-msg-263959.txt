If you didn't share in the shard debt, then can you really say
that you'd be sharing the debt of the guy who "took one for the
team", especially if you'd managed to get in really deep some
place and couldn't realisticly recover the shard?

It seems to me that Mark points directly at the real issue:
"you only get to share in the debt reduction for recovering a
shard if you're still grouped."  That's what they need to fix.
It's not as if they don't have ready access to a powerful
database server to handle the accounting.
