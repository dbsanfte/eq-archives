Selos' Song of Travel is an interesting little song.

Invisibility, Levitation, and Selos run speed in one package.

Use with extreme care.  One wrong move and you can end up losing
all three effects simultaneously.

Soaring at bard speeds over rough terrain, the fall can kill you.

Running thru a pile of mobs, the run speed dropping out can kill
you.  (yes, it will pop back up a tic later if you are still
singing it, but a bunch of mobs you were scared of to start with
can probably count on bashing you successfully and forcing you to
try and restart, plus they won't be fooled by your new invis and
if they manage a hit your invis drops again, along with movement
and lev as usual)

You can't keep regular selos on, and even if you could, every
time you started Selos you'd break SSOT.

You can't keep 2 minute selos (SAC) on because they take the same
slot, same for TBoots/JBoots and SOW.

What would cause a drop?  Well, for a bard on his own, not too
much.  Rarely you miss an entire three song cycle and appear;
this sucks.  But more often you get spotted by a see invis mob,
if it can manage a hit your invis breaks and everything in range
sees you and never forgets it.

In a group, though, all you need is some lag or someone falling
too far behind or getting too far ahead.  Bang, 10,000hp fall or
maybe you just leave him in the dust... but worst case is he's
seen by a mob and somehow gets back in your song range; now you
are casting on him so all those mobs get you on their hate list
too!  If you are headed for zone this is no biggie, but it can
mean nasty surprises if you weren't, with half the mobs in the
zone passing around word about you and trading hate lists.

Why use it?  Well, its handy for long runs, levitation along with
selos is a good idea since bard safe fall caps at 40 (50 for Vah
Shir, Nyah Nyah silly furless bards) and people travelling with
you may not have safe fall at all.  Invis while running thru mobs
is also often very handy, with this you don't have to stopping in
a safe spot to reapply SAC every couple minutes.  It doesn't
require a wind instrument, which lets you avoid swapping in a
flute over your drum for invisible travelling... but its main
advantage is on CRs:

Don't need a flute, don't need a drum (faster with a drum mind
you) so you can move decently swiftly and relatively safely from
your bind point to your body without a stop at the bank.

Of course it doesn't work indoors, so if you died inside and
would need invis to get to your body you need that flute, and
even if you have to cross a hostile indoors area you probably
need one.

At any rate, just use with extreme caution, and consider SAC and
clicky SS Boots levitate instead for most purposes

LLyric

ps: now that I have run 2 this song is a lot safer, if invis gets
broken by a mob at least I'm still faster than most mobs, the
odds of me living long enough to get it started again, and being
out of bash range when I do are a lot better now.
