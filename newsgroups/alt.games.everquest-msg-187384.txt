Hi everyone:

After getting some great help here on removing a very annoying pop-up, I
have discovered that I have another, and try as I might, I can't fathom out
how to disable it.

This is a brand new PC - one that came with pre-installed *software* on it,
and though I usually like to format my drive and install my own copy of
Windows XP (Pro) I simply haven't had the time to do it.

So to my question: The PC I ended up by buying is an HP Pavilion 764n. It's
a nice machine, but not too long after I boot up I get a pop-up that says ..

'Would you like to view the available updates for your 'Powered by VERITAS'
products?' - And the pop-up programme name is called 'VERITAS Update Manager
'.

I've searched through my software and am unable to locate anything made by
Veritas, and there's nothing in my 'Start-up' folder.

Can someone shed some light on how to remove this, or at least stop the damn
thing from self-activating? This isn't 'Windows Messenger Service, I know
how to disable that one, this one is just as annoying. I'm using Windows XP
Home Edition.

Many thanks again for your time.

Stevie.
