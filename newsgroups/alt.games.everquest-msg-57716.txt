In my opinion they do, to some extant, support that type of bigotry.  Try
using a foreign language to create a name that includes a d' as an integral
part of the word.  The problem is that the rules are written in such a way
to prohibit that (a la my Coeurd'Aigle problems).  The explanation is that
the ' separates 2 words and is not an integral part of the language.  The
problem with the naming conventions is that they are ethno-centrically (is
that a real word?) English in nature.  I understand the reasoning, I
disagree with the results.
