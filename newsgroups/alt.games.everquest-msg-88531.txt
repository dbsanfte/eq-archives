To get his skills up a cleric friend of mine asked me to create the worst
pet that still was blue to him and then to dual him.

Mage earth pets without burnout are not so good fighters (and have no nukes,
just the root), plus their masters can kill them in a heartbeat. They're
npc's so your skills will go up. If you've got a friend with monster
summoning that's even better because those don't even root and melee a bit
more (faster def skill up).
