That is the biggest problem with all of the epics. Long camps with
rare mobs (using place holders) that offer nothing for the people
helping the person trying to complete their epic.

Using the LDON model (and expanding on it) in EQ2 SOE could turn Epic
quests into something special and rewarding to all participants.

My dream would be to see "instanced" dungeons that require a minumum
level raid force for epics. These "i-dungeons" could tailor themselves
to the raid force and provide useful drops for raid members as they
work through the dungeon to get to the drop needed for the epic. This
would make the effort worthwhile to all participants and make each
epic quest battle/encounter unique for each player.
