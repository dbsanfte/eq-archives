Robe graphics are race dependant, not class dependant, so Human druids do,
but wood elf, halfling and half-elf do not, because those races have no
int-casters.  This is also why cleric usable robes cannot be used by
halflings or dwarves, but can be worn by gnomes, because they have
int-casters.

also, wolves in robes look really... odd.
