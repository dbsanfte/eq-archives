Hmm, I'd have to say there is no best, but if I wanted to show how
clerics have druids beat out I think it might go like this....

Clerics don't have to solo, folks want them around.
Clerics are the best healers.
Clerics have some major ac and hp buffs, which are some of the best
buffs you can get.
Clerics get both teleport and movement enhancing spells as well as mana
and hp regen spells and choice of which spot to sit when the group sets
up.  At least they'd better if them druids and enchanters and what nots
expect a res some day.
Clerics have the best pets in the game, warriors pallys sks monks will
gladly go beat things up if you promise to heal them during and after. 
You don't have to get hit, you don't have to sweat, all you have to do
is keep everyone around you alive and they do all the hard stuff.

Yup, I could go on, but I'd have to say clerics have druids beat all to
heck <EG>.
