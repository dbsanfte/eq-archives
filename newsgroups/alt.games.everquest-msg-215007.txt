Very nice cash indeed.

I did four LDON dungeons with a 65 wizard on Saturday; I ended the day
1500pp richer, 3AAs higher and with a couple of equipment upgrades.  If I'd
spent that time in a HoH or BoT group, I'd have made probably more XP but
definitely less or no cash and with no equipment upgrades.

My enchanter has stopped even looking up when folks /ooc "Any KEI? will
donate."  I can make better cash in an hour in LDON than I can whoring KEI
in PoK, get experience at the same time, and not have to put up with boredom
and annoying personalities.  KEI vendors on Xegony are becoming a rarity,
though there will always be a few hardcore ones.
