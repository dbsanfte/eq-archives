Main Entry: 2ex�ploit

Yes, I can quote from m-w.com, also.  And, I stand by what I wrote.  I do
not blame him for doing exactly what he did.  I may have done it myself.  He
did not, however, do the quest exactly as it was supposed to be done.  He
added steps by doing some over, which is not the exact path of the quest.
So, he tried to gain advantage (per your definition) by making productive
use of the fact that he could do some steps multiple times to gain faction.

Is this an evil attempt to circumvent the quest?  In a word, no.  I would
not, however, put the blame solely on others shoulders.  Should SOE pony up
the Spear of Fate or rest faction (as they did)?  I think he should get the
spear or at least the quest items to a reasonable point to continue the
quest to a proper completion.
