  For the most part, the loot is absolute crap in MS.  That said,
if I am in a pick up group and I don't get equal looting rights,
I leave (after a few warnings).  Cleric does NOT mean "not
allowed to loot" in Norrathian.  

   I think I would also disband a group that told me to get KEI. 
Really, did they get irate when you didn't say "Yessir Massa!" to
them the first time they told you?  I would disband the first
time I got told to do this.  This sounds like a number crunching
type of group that won't let an enchanter in because they would
just be "taking up a slot" because the casters can go buy KEI.  I
think the way I would have handled that would be to say something
along the lines of "How much downtime do you think you'll have
with no cleric at all, jerks?", though I might not that polite,
depending on how much crap they'd been giving me.  And I would
demand an answer, then an apology.  I probably would be out of
the group pretty damned quickly.

   I don't know how hard it is for clerics to get into groups on
your server, but most servers I've been to it fairly easy. 
Logging off and playing a soloing class for a bit is also easy.  
People, being people, will always try to feed  you shit, but you
can always push the plate away and say "No thanks."
