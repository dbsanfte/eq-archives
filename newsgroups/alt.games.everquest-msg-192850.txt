And you know it only requires changing 1 "constant"....how? Also
consider the need to re-balance a good portion of the game around
larger groups, re-figure xp splitting (Can't have the same amount
being split among 2 more people, or else it won't be worth grouping
with a full group), etc. Really, it's not as simple as you assume.
