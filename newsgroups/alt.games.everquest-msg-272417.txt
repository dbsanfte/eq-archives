	I do.

	It will take twice as long as they say it will, will require 
three patches to fix the problems the patch introduced, will introduce
at least 3 completely new and annoying bugs, and the only noticeable
improvements will be fluffy clouds and a lowered cast time on some
obscure beastlord spell.

	 You dont' have to be psychic to predict SOE.
