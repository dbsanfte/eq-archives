(Note: I haven't been reading earlier messages in this thread, so don't take
this as support of either side in full.  Nor am I really going to get fully
involved in the discussion.)

I believe the point he was trying to make is that all of the people who were
brought here through slavery are dead and gone, as are those that did the
act to them.

Slavery was an awful, horrible thing, that never should have happened.  That
being said though, I personally have never enslaved anyone, nor have I ever
met anyone who was a slave.

And the idea that someone is telling me how much I personally owe them (in
terms of slavery reparations, advantages at job opportunities, scholarships,
etc..), because someone with my skin color did an awful thing to someone
with thier skin color, 200 years before I was even born, does not sit well
with me at all.
