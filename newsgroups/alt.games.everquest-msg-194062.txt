Last night I was working POD CCY with a necro in the group, when
something weird happened.  I used my SS helm to put up an Eye of
Zomm for scouting purposes, although the necro was puller (and
running around with his pet following him).  He pulled a mob, so
I clicked off the eye effect as he was coming back to the group
with it, and suddenly his pet attacked me.   I ran off yelling at
him to back his pet off, then circled back in and it was on me
again.  After a bit he figured out what I was saying and backed
it off and we were able to procede as usual.

A little later, I deliberately clicked the eye up with him
standing next to me, and the pet attacked my eye and when it
died, turned and attacked me.  I'm not certain that he didn't
deliberately have the pet attack the eye in that case, but it
still shouldn't have attacked me afterwords, or been able to.

Also, I am absolutely certain he didn't have the pet attack my
eye the first time, "Eye" was over by the castle doors and he was
at the hole in the bone wall with his pet pulling in our
lightcrawler snack.

I don't really use the eye all that much, so I can't tell if this
is a common occurance or something unique to the zone or a fluke.

Of course todays' patch includes the line
- Fixed a bug that would allow PC's to be attacked by PC
controlled pets (in non-PvP
situations).
so perhaps its been fixed just as I noticed it.
