Ohh and i forgot, who would sell one for 5-10pp? maybe some high level
guy in velious, but then again they would probably give them away, the
velium dagger costs in thurgadin at the store scars edge something
like 50pp, and that is with my chanter that has 80cha, not 100%
certain about the price though.
