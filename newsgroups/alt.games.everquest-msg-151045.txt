This deserves a lot of emphasis.  Healer mobs seem to place a very
high priority on healing themselves.  To the point where, once the
mob decides to start healing itself, you can often beat it to death
without taking (further) damage other than an occasional riposte if
you are able to interrupt all of its casts.  And mobs that have
CHeal are actually the easiest to do this to, CHeal has a very long
cast time (10 seconds).
