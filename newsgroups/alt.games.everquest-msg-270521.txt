I don't think it matters *where* SOE says official announcements will
be posted.  Customers shouldn't have to go *digging* for information
such as scheduled and unscheduled downtime, even if that information
is reasonably easily available on a web forum.

You should start EQ, and if the game in unavailable due to the servers
being down, EQ itself should tell you, right then and there.  No fuss,
no muss, it should just tell you.  It's not rocket science.

SOE has no qualms about *spamming* you when you start up EQ, surely
they can tell you if the servers are down for maintenance.
