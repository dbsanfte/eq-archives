Unless a game is made totally fubared like Anarchy Online, more than
256 meg ram is going to be pretty dang moot. Of course ram can never
hurt and is the cheapest way to upgrade a computer right now. I myself
may go to like 384 meg since I have 128 now and 256 meg sims are so
cheap (and my mb only takes as big as 256 sims per slot)

For luclin at least with 128 or 256 more ram and a geforce 2 64 meg
I'd be fine I'm sure even though I only have a p2 400 proc.
