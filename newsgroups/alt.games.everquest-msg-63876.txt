I can only guess that they might choose the one card over the other because
the Voodoo series of cards are still widely used in existing machines.
Guillemot and Hercules are pretty high profile too, so I can't imagine why
they wouldn't support them, but if I were to guess, I'd say Voodoo cards are
still second most common 3d card, behind only nVidia cards.  But your
question seems to ask for a reason based on the capabilities of the cards in
question.  If that's true, then I have no good answer for you -- I thought
3dfx and their Voodoo cards are defunct precisely because the rest of the
industry had left them behind.
