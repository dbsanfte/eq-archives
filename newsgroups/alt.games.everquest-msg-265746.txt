They told you they phased out PC games? Sounds like the guy you spoke to 
was talking crap.

If you go into any EB store you will see boxes and boxes of pre orders 
for Halflife 2, EverQuest 2 and World of Warcraft. PC games have 
definitly not been phased out. Some of my workmates have pre ordered EQ2 
from EB games, while I pre ordered WoW CE from EB.

This is all from EB parramatta.
