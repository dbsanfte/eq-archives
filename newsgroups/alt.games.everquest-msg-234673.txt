I think the best way to handle this would be to save the guy, if it is not
too dangerous to yourself, and then explain in detail your problem with his
play-style.
Or, if you are a bit meaner, let him die and then explain in detail, your
problem with his play-style, that also explains why you let him die.

Either way, the guy MAY be more likely to remember your criticisms.
