Counting in the expenses of making kiola, the failure rate, and the
much lower expenses of making stuff like short ale, the only reason to
make kiola for experience is that you don't have to lug casks around -
and even then I'd go with fish wine instead. Most tailorers I know
make their own kiola, I have never seen a market for the stuff.
I made juice to 24, then short ale to 51, ale to 68, white wine to 82,
red wine to 95, vodka to 135 and am now at 160 with ginesh (being a
forager obviously helps)
I never made a single bottle of kiola until my skill was above 90.
