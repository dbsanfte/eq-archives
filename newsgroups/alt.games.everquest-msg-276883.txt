Prior to said legislation in California, intruders into homes had 
successfully sued, or their heirs, when force, in some cases lethal, was 
used against said intruders.  The legislators decided to make it 
absolutely clear that if you ilegally enter someones house, you will be 
presumed to be armed and a lethal threat to occupants of said house, even 
if it later turns out you were not armed.
