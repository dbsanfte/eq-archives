Maybe, but I tend to doubt it. It's usually not all that hard to get a
feel for the level of equipment on someone in a pickup group and
unless you assume that they bagged their one piece of really good gear
on the off chance that something specific would drop it's not all that
hard to figure out. IME, it's surprising how often people, even in a
pickup group, will come right out and tell you that something is a
marginal or situational NBG upgrade.

Heh, I always preferred the IFS to a T-staff for my monk. No annoying
agro issues from the proc when I wasn't playing Main Tank and hit to
my armor class from that overweight T-staff when I was. Never owned a
T-Staff although I did borrow one for a few days but I wouldn't have
traded my IFS for it.
