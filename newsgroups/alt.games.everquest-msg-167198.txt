Not immediately.  When we arrived in Fear at about 5:30PM PST, only one of
them was up.  The other two spawned while we were there.  Unfortunately, the
Wraith of Shissar was not up, and did not pop while we were there.  The goal
of the raid was the Wraith for a guildie enchanter.  The good news is that I
got my tear, another guildie got his tear, and a warrior from an allied
guild got his Golem Ball, and I believe and SK got his epic drop as well.
We downed all 3 of the Golems, last one was trained on us during a corpse
dragging, fortuantely, it was the wimpier one, and we managed to kill it
anyway.
