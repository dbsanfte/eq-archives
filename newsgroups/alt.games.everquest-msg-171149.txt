There was a great quote about that in the latest Terry Pratchett novel.  
There's a revolution in Ankh-Morpork, and I think it was the Patrician who 
said something like "The ones waving flags aren't real Morporkians.  Real 
Morporkians don't need to wave a flag.  They already know they're 
Morporkian."

I'll acept the second correction.  I'm not so sure about the first, they 
look a bit too desperate to be picky about how many issues are involved.

I did catch that, but it's that exact "no campfire for me" issue that 
makes it ring rather untrue.  If I have to choose between my ideals and 
warmth, my ideals keep winning.  Darn it.
