For sure...  I played a monk as my first character when the game first came
out.   I spent much time getting him to level 10'ish, and buying all of his
leather armor.

Yes, leather armor.  I had no clue there was anything like a weight limit.  He
would go into combat at about 44 of 80 pounds, (60 or 70 once he had looted a
few ruined bear pelts) and get his ass kicked ; P

But thats not really what the original poster is talking about.   Armor class
is a basic concept, not only in EQ, but in almost all muds and role playing
games.  Of the stats that you're given, armor class should have been
completely obvious.  I think it took me about .00001 seconds when first
starting to guess what it was and what it did, in a general sense at least.
