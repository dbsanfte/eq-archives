Where did I indicate that this is ANYTHING other than my admittedly
undiluted opinion?  Show me where I stated that this is absolute truth
or a hard and fast rule....nice "Straw Man" argument, there - saying
that I said something I didn't and knocking it down to try to prove
that my entire argument is fallacious.

As for my opinion, if you look at the word "work" from a scientific
point of view, ANYTHING you do that requires that your body burn fuel
is work - but I won't go that far afield. :)
