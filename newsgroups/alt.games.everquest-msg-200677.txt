The only thing that's gone on that machine recently is the latest
version of WinAmp, which would be an unlikely culprit.  Generally
speaking the machine is used exclusively for EQ, plus the occasional
bit of browsing/CD burning - I have other machines for other tasks.
So I doubt that it's a DX9 problem, although it's probably worth
investigating if nothing else crops up.
