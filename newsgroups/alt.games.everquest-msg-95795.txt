This is my issue.

I start everquest, log on without any problems, connect to my server with no
problem. Get to the character selection screen and select a char. (I have 4,
tried all. All are in different zones being Paineel, LOIO, Vah Shar, and
Greater Faydark). The character loads fine, and I enter the world.

Thats where it begins.... my cablemodem starts transfering data like crazy,
and I see my lag meter go up to 90% and boom. Disconnected. I can't stay
online for more then 30 seconds or so.

I pinged my server and it came back with 150 msec, which is not bad from
europe.

My machine:

AMD Duron 800 Mhz
640 Mb (no not the infamous 640k hehe)
Geforce 2 MX
Multiple Gb of free diskspace for possible swap.

My cable connection is 256kbit/s up, and 1536kbit/s downstream. No problems
with other online games.

Now, I haven't been playing since the previous patch. Last time I played was
about a month ago and everything worked fine.

Anyone any idea?

Maarten
