Some do, some don't.  None of the 39s do, though.
http://eq.castersrealm.com has a decent spell list, and the detailed
descriptions will tell you which are which.  I do know that WC requires a
fragment.  That sucks since it, DL and GD are the top 3 requests...but in a
way it isn't, since you don't have to feel guilty for asking for a donation.
