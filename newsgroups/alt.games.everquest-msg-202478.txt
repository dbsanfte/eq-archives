The point if my message was - WHY show the servers up if the patch is not
finished?

Incidently I doubt if trying to log on has anything to do with 'Server
Congestion' as the error message says. I play in the Uk and I dount that that
many people in the US were up and about trying to log on to EQ plus the same
message have been displayed for two hours now - long enough to have dealt with
any server congestion.
