I think it is all relative to the level of the group. 

1-44 Wizards offer nothing that cannot be found in another class, and
these classes offer more versatility. That doesn't mean Wizards "suck"
in an exp group. It just means that they are not as useful or as
wanted. 

Druids have decent nukes, heal, DoTs, SoW, damage shields, and can
Port.

Mages nuke for nearly the same amount of damage and come with thier
own tank (eg pet). They can also summon items useful to any group
(bangages, arrows, armor, weapons, ect)

45-60 Wizards are much needed in any EXP grind, and valuable in all
raid situations. Thier ability to quad-kite, and do obscene amounts of
DD or AE damage makes them one of the most powerful classes end-game.

A good Wiz is hard to find, and I salute all of the high level Wizs
that stuck it out.
