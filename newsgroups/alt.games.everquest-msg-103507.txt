You did hear that slamming sound around the time of Ben's first post
didn't you?  You know, when he annointed himself as the "Grand Poobah
of Interpreting the Designer's Intent Regardless of Anything They or
Anybody Else Might Have to Say" (see Dan Harmon's quote from the manual
elsewhere in this thread, for example), and then firmly shut his mind
to any thought that might originate outside of itself?

OTOH, if you're just amusing yourself with a bit of troll-baiting, well,
to each his own.
