Noob! Flame! Flame! Flame!

Okey, with that out of the way, you will need to have the Shadows of 
Luclin expansion to be able to make use of the Bazaar (it's well worth 
getting for that alone, even if your box can't quite handle the rest of 
the Luclin zones). First you need to find your way to a wizard Spire (in 
Toxxulia Forest, Dreadlands, Great Divide, North Karana and Greater 
Faydark. Depending on your starting city, GFay or Toxx would be the 
easiest to get to. Stuff could eat you in your way to NK) and tell the 
Scion (those nice ladies in white robes) "I wish to journey to Luclin". 
Keep the stone they give you and just sit on your butt until the spire 
fires and takes you to Luclin.

Once there, you take the East (IIRC) portal (it's the one with the 
female half-elf NPC standing by it), and there you go... Just hope that 
your machine can handle the load, and happy bargain hunting.

PS. See if you can buy yourself a Wakizashi of the Frozen Skies or two... 
Great weapons for lowbie rangers (although they don't start proccing 
until lvl 20) and they should be dirt-cheap now.

PPS. On re-reading your post I see you are in HighHold, so disregard the 
above and head for North Karana... :)
