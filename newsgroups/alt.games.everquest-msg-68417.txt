I m not agree, if you have a look to the past, actual and future mmorpg they
try to get rid of the npc and IA. You should experience a pvp server,
moreover if you dislike twinks and uber players. Come on rallos zek, it s
another world. You dont have only to take care of stupid mobs, but vicious
players. This is a real challenge.

Only if you have 2 accounts, if this is the case, make a caster to bind
yourself, a druid to tp later

Ok, next, lets give caster NPC fightin abilities to caster PC. A wizard
punch you for 124 points of damages ... why not ? lets screw the gameplay !
You are too greedy, you are not objective.

Are you afraid ? You must have balls to play on a pvp server, you have to
masterise you skills and char abilities, be tactic, quick to react, have
eyes in you back, know you enemy, use tradeskills to equip yourself at the
beguining. This is another dimension in the gameplay than camp mobs for
hours and hours.

The monster on test server, will be prolly later a new class playable to add
clever NPC in the environement. I love that idea, but not you it seems, you
dont like the challenge, you want everything be easy, quick, painless,
foreseeable.

Attack an PC in a city, near a guard, he ll teach you his "vision"

I never had this problem, you should ask more politely or maybe with more
humility.

Play on a pvp, look around you, seek the twinks, even most of main char 40+
have crappy equipement.

If you catch one, hail him, and ask him by tell, he will bind you, morever
for a sow or a buff.
You dont use use the good methode, or act like a jerk, because i never had
to ask twice for a bind.

I m betatesting DAoC europe, this game sucks, not finished. Social part is
almost inexistant, player dont communiacte each other unless they are RL
friends, i never seen something on the brodcast channel. Everybody is
playing alone due to the solo abilities of every classes. There is no
coercion between players. The environement is cold in DAoC. There is also
too many restrictions in the gameplay.

True. But that not make the binding more difficult.

After reading your thougt, you look someone hurried, you want instant fun
(play ?), easy kill, you want to be able to do everything you need, you
dislike challenge, you dislike playing *against* other PC, you refuse tactic
fights. I dont know why you are still playing EQ. You hate the "Vision" but
you are still here. I dont manage to understand you ...
