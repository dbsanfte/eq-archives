For your secondary hand speed is entirely irrelevant; go for the best
ratio you can afford. I should think a centi shortsword would fit
your budget nicely, its about 12/25 and probably can be got for around 800pp.

In fact, I sold a shortsword and spear for 800pp together a few days ago
to a reseller, but that was primarily cause I loathe hanging around in
EC. She was pleased at the profit potential, I was pleased to leave ;)

Bear in mind fast weapons that can be used primary hand will have a markup
that makes them unsuitable for offhand - no point in paying the extra for
a lammy in your offhand when the speed benefit you're paying for isnt going
to have any effect.

One other consideration; I have no idea how insane rangers on your server
are , but I've seen the *fantastic*  31/35 woodsmans staff going for
around 2k on mine; its 2hb, but honestly, until you get your epics its
going to be one of the best weapons you can find. 

It shouldnt be that low, I dont know what people are thinking, but you
just might find it is. PRrobably not a weapon you want if you tank a lot,
though. 

....

...waits for the hordes of idiots to arrive telling her rangers cant tank.
