One quick note:

There are 3 secret entrances/exits from the Jail room.  One comes from
the pit you jumped down, one goes upstairs into the castle, and one goes
out back into the graveyard.  That entrance/exit is (if I remember my
directions correctly) in the NE corner of the graveyard, behind the
mausoleum.  This 3rd passage is significant because it doesn't involve
jumping from anything.  It is, however, sometimes guarded by a caster
out in the graveyard, so exiting in a hurry can occasionally be painful.
