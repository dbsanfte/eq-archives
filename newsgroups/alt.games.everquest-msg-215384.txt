Couple other pieces of data from the tower

Mistwyn -
In my first adventure group consisted of a 58 Paly, 58 Dru, 57 Dru, 56 
Sham, 55 Mage (me) and a 55 Sham. The 2 58's got 21 pts, 57 Dru got 20 and 
everyone else got 19. This was a collection mission. We succeeded. 

Second adventure with my Alt Rogue. Group consisted of 36 Cleric, 36 
Ranger, 34 Rog (me), 32 Sham, 32 Monk, 32 Necro. The 2 36's got 4 pts and 
everyone else got 3. This was a Rescue mission. We succeeded. 

/end quote

First adventure = avg level 56 (rounded down).  Makes it at level
55 adventure.  According to our table the 58 should have gotten 
22-23 points, but only got 21.

Second = avg level 33 (round down).  According to our table the 
36's should have gotten 5, they got 4.

So, from this we conclude that there is a fudge factor based on
the level range - perhaps?
