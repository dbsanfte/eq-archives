Any creature capable of dropping a "chunk of meat" or even a breed
specific meat which is capable of being baked into a food item, should
be eligible for hunting by any race/class, even the druids. The
creatures of the forest are certainly there to help sustain us in our
travels. (And we them, in too many cases. <g> ) Plus, the Druids get
that whole, "thinning the herd" thing as a pass on that. The necros? 
/em shrugs
"They're alive. That's offense enough."

The Rangers?
See Druids above.

Other random Tunare worshipping classes? Sustenance. I certainly hope
that rotten Tunare bitch isn't passing out literature now demanding her
followers all be vegans.

All other classes? Shouldn't be a conflict from RP measures.

As to the intelligent race NPC's, I guess I can see where some might
have a problem. The froggies are the ancestral enemies of the Trolls,
not to mention a tasty food treat, so no problem there. But if you're a
light race, and you don't eat them, and they are only apprehensive to
you, I guess it would be an issue.
