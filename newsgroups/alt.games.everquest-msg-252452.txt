You know, when I first read about this, that's the first thing that occurred
to me.

There may have been a completely different reason for SOE to have posted
their poll on assisting the transfer of purchased platinum, which was to
ward off a possible conflagration like this one, rather than endorse the
selling of platinum, items and accounts.

If a court finds that a person has a property interest in the items in their
characters' possession, SOE would really be screwed, and it's just easier
for them to try to avoid that finding, one way or another, in the first
place.
