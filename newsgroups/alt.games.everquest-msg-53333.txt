One of the (arguably) best GM events I have been involved in was the
christmas visit by Santug Clugg. The items recieved were cookies and
milk. While it did not increase my characters stash, level, or power, the
event brought people running from zone to zone trying to catch up to
the big jolly troll in red. Everyone from level 1 to 50 were acting like
children at a christmas party. It was well thought out, from the icy wind
that blew thru my speakers to the snow that fell in Butcherblock. The
only thing missing was turning all the bard songs into Christmas Carols. ;-)

Events don't always have to be about quests. Half a dozen pumpkin heads
running thru a zone chasing people "headless horseman" style until they
reach
the guards is fun, if it is well planned. The reward is the fun that is had.
Every
day of our EQ lives we spend trying to level, so events should be a vacation
from "work". Also, most of the reward type of event seems to be set up for
the higher level players, and the newbies are left out.... These are the
ones
that events should be targeting to show them what fun EQ is!
