I have Gnome Necromancer and I am trying to gain faction with the Dwarfs and
the Halflings. Tonight I killed tonnes of Goblins and Orcs in the Misty
Thicket and it does not look like I have even made a dent in my faction with
the Halfings. I am still KOS to the guards, but I do have several backpacks
for of Deathfist Belts.

Can anyone suggest a faster way for me to raise my faction with these two
races?

 Is there away for me to hand in all of these belts that I have when I KOS?

Any advice would be greatly appeciated.
