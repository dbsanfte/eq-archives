Unfortunately, the main quest I used was the no-longer-a-going-concern 
Bread Run from South Karana, which was related to the Cursed Karanas 
state of affairs. That one gave straight faction raises to Clurg and the 
Bouncer faction (Crakneks? I can't recall right now). I used it as a 
leg-up until Clurg started to accept the Compendium for the Stein quest. 
From then on, it's self-sustaining, as the Stein quest raises Clurg and 
Bouncer faction. Unfortunately for you in particular, that quest (and I 
think most quests that give Clurg raises) lowers your faction with Kazon 
Stormhammer, which isn't perhaps the best idea for a Dwarf. Then again, 
you can always raise Kazon faction at your guild.

Apparently, Loaves of Bread now drop off some goblins in Runnyeye, I 
think, but not commonly enough to make it viable to use them to raise 
oggok faction. I've heard of a quest involving froglok meat which you can 
probably do with the help of a friendly, Wolf Form-sharing Druid. I can't 
remember the details right now, but I'll look it up later in Allakhazam.

The Stein quest also raises Green Blood Crusaders (or something similar), 
which I believe is the Troll Warrior faction. Between that and Wolf Form, 
perhaps there is a possibility to do some easy quest to raise the faction 
further. I'm definitely not going to make a full-time job of it, 
though... :)
