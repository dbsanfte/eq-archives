Yeah, tell me about it, I don't go out much anymore because it's so damned
expensive though, the cost of eating out, movies, bowling, heck anything has
gone up plus gas, so I don't normally leave the house except for my 2 days a
week off unless a friend wants to pick me up in their car.  Actually though,
most of the time that I'm online it is with my friends.  Once my car is
payed off though I am going to college, hopefully I can get a job making 50k
a year or more within the next 2 to 4 years and then I will have enough
money to drive the car that I like, own a nice house and stilll have some
left over to indulge myself.  As it is now I'm only making 10k after taxes.
:(
