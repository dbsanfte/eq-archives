Near the end of the business day, thoughts drifting to EQ later, I
remembered a very odd thing which I noticed last night. I was killing
the EE's in the gorge, and for every one that I killed, I got a
*positive* faction hit with Runnyeye. Also, when we were playing around
in there earlier, the bartender and some other gob in the basement
conned either dubious or indifferent, which I found surprising.
   I'll confess I never paid much attention, but I don't seem to recall
getting positive faction hits for Runnyeye from killing EE's before. I
wonder if you can get up to indifferent with the whole zone? I wonder if
they have any quests to give? I wonder if you have to speak goblin to do
them?
