Actually, I would guess that the route was different.  I think its
more likely that it went from a term of endearment to a moderate
insult for wimps/homosexuals.  It would be rather like a bully-type
person calling someone who didn't want to fight a 'sweetheart' in a
mock-affectionate tone now ("Aren't you just the precious little
sweetheart?  I wouldn't want you to break a nail, so you better run
along home and let the real men take care of business.")  Since women
were (and to a large degree, still are...) considered less-than-equal
to men, a term of endearment to a woman would be considered an insult
when applied to a man.

Most likely it wound up coming into common usage as a derogatory term
for weak men and thereby gained its not-so-good connotations, and fell
out of use as an endearment term.  It would then most likely wind up
as a derogatory term when applied to women, too, as in men in a bar
saying something like "lets go find us some pussies", meaning find
some loose women/prostitutes.  From there, its just a hop, skip and a
jump to go from women who are easy to the sexual organ itself.

That's just all supposition, though  :)
