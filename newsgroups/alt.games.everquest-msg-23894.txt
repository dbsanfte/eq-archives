I can see his point, though.  I heard that when the server first opened up,
that the Paineel newbie area was absolutely swamped.  I'm sure this
discouraged most Evil Erudites, and most of them probably dropped out, or
switched to Iksars and Dark Elves.

Earlier on, I was envisioning this intimidating legion of ringmail-clad,
Warrens-loot-encrusted Paineelians suddenly showing up in the Qeynos
Catacombs, and immediately afterwards, in the Qeynos Hills, crushing
everything in sight.  Now I think I have some idea why this hasn't
happened...a much lower population in Paineel that what the first reports
indicated.

This move would still be a great tactic, if the attack could be coordinated
with Evils attacking Highpass, Rivervale, and South Karana at the same
time....even better if it accidently coincided with a Good Team assault on
Blackburrow.  But in the meantime, for an individual Evil Erudite just to
make it alive to the Qeynos Aquaducts would be quite an
accomplishment....even more of one if he can get OUT of the Aquaducts alive,
as the Neuts camp most of the stuff down there now.

The Paineelians are trapped....they have Paineel, The Warrens, the South
half of the Toxxulia Forest, and the Hole.  Outside of that, they're KOS to
both teams from the Toxx to the Kith.  I don't know how well Paineelians are
received by NPC Ogres and Trolls, but Ogguk is their next closest allied
base.
