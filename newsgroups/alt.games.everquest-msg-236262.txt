One time in plane of tactics a chanter and their group was trying to steal a
boar I was killing by charming it. I loaded disspell up and broke charm and
it BOLTED to him and did some damage, he tried rooting it and recharming.. I
re-disspelled it and it killed him.

sometimes it takes playing equally as dirty to get the point across.

but justified or not in your mind, a gm will bust your ass up for it if you
get caught. so, dont get caught.
