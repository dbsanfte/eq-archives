All I can say is that when I did the quest, the book was sitting there in
the middle of the floor - was kinda sticking out of the floor, like it was
half-buried.  The book itself was on a fast timer, IIRC - something like one
real-time hour.

If it's not there, you might try /bug and /petition.

It's been a year since I've done the quest, so I don't know if it's been
changed at all.

Sorry, Jazz.  =(
