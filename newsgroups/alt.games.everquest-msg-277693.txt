Problem was, it wasn't just monks and guards that were doing it.
Assassins could also tank almost anything without getting touched.  I
assume the other classes could also.  The only difference was the real
tanks could absorb a hit better if they happened to get touched.

I agree totally, but you forgot SKs in there also (don't know how well
a Pally can do).  I can't wait for them to balance scouts.

The problem is, how do you balance us, and what is the real problem?
Is it because of how fast our weapons are, which necessitates a lower
damage and we hit the haste cap while others don't?  Is it because of
the insane resists on some mobs (especially epic) to slash/pierce and
we don't have crush to fall back on?  I agree we need to be fixed, and
can't wait for it to happen (nothing makes me feel as good as getting
out-DPSed by a SK by 80+ on a raid mob).  I just don't think it is as
easy as everybody assumes.

I agree, the majority are incredibly weak.  I was just saying there are
some good ones in there.

Only problem I heard was the insane power requirements.  I did hear
furniture will be affecting vitality regeneration though, which should
help you guys a lot.  Even if you are gimped as a class, there are some
really cool things that can be done with what you create.
