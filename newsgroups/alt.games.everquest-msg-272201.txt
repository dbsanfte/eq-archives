I'm lucky in that I'm in a guild, so almost any anything I need can be
obtained in a day or so (we have a website, and we have a forum for
crafting requests) and for a good price (we have 2 tiers of pricing,
guild and non-guild).

If I was playing alone, crafting would be almost impossible, or at
least very expensive, without the use of alts.

Bunnies aren't just cute like everybody supposes !
They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
