So, you think it would be better that I left your assertion:
"There is little or no strategy involved to playing a druid."
unchallenged?  I disagree.  The place for my response to your
post was in response to your post.  It would've been better,
maybe, had I snipped the question you responded to, so that
there would be no mistaking just what and why I was arguing.
Regardless, as I pointed out, depending on just why you are
soloing a Druid your answer may or may not be correct.  IOW,
your conditionally correct answer _is_ subject to debate,
because it was presented without sufficient qualification.
All that is, of course, my opinion.  Feel free to see the
matter differently.

Nope.  Well, the drifting part wouldn't be wrong.  I doubt that
you're gonna succeed in convincing my about the caning part tho.
