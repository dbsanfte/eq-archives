Not by a long shot. Some people seem to think that mana is free (they
totally miss the part where mana = time = money/xp), and that it is
the job of a druid to Sow them, just as they think clerics are morally
obligated to heal or rez them, and enchanters to cast clarity, and so
on.

Best solution is generally to just ignore the beggars when you don't
have the time or inclination to do what they want. I keep meaning to
make a hotkey that sends a polite reply. One of these days I'll get
around to it.
