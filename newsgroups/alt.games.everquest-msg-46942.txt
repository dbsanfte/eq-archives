<shrug> Perhaps this guy who started this thread was, I honestly could not
tell you, or atleast, dont feel like tallying up all those that I believe to
have been "sleeping." :)

As for me.  I knew something like this would happen, in fact when the first
plane hit I was just waiting for another plane to hit a nuclear power plant.
Whoever the terrorists are, they are indeed idiots, without a doubt.  Not
just idiots in general mind you, but idiots on being terrorists.  Three Mile
Island is no more than (aeronautically) 3-4 miles away from Harrisburg
International Airport.  20 minutes before a plane set to land at HIA, hijack
it, run it into TMI's reactor dome (which they have already mentioned could
not withstand a commercial liner hitting it) and job is done.

I suppose what I'm trying to say is, I am surprised they didn't take more
extreme measures.  I have been to HIA and I know the security there is
fairly lax, perhaps a bit more lax than what it USED to be at say Ronald
Reagan, BWI, etc.  So it wouldn't have been any more difficult to pull this
off, in fact it might have been easier.

Am I glad they didn't?  Hell yes I am.  I am from Middletown PA (the town in
which TMI - Three Mile Island can be found) so the impact of an event such
as the hypothetically one explained above would have been greater, far
greater.

Bah, I went into a rambling somewhat.  Sumarize all that I have written and
interpret it as this: "No, I wasn't thinking something like this would
happen.  I was more less referring to those who didn't think something like
this would happen."
