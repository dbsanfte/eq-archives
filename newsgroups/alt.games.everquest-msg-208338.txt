Not really worth the trouble to single pull. They can be root parked
pretty easily if you have room.

Sounds about right

You probably won't need malo to slow em, malo helps to keep them root
parked if you don't have an enchanter though. 

>6) need 57 enchanter to mez
Crowd control is optional. If you don't have it, run without a damage
shield up so you don't put them into summoning mode while you park
them.

Getting to them really is the hardest part, ime. Shrooms are pretty MR
and anytime you fight summoning mobs that can CH and gate, it's a
dangerous situation. I don't think I've ever wiped to jugs but I have
wiped several times getting there. Shroom gates, summons someone and
it goes downhill from there.

Bring a porter. The best place to set up initially is right at the
beginning of the Jugs area. You'll come to a castle style wall with a
opening in the middle, 2 or 3 jugs before you get to the wall. Behind
it there's a large room (plenty of room to root park) that's out of
agro range of everything except for one roaming jug. You'll see a door
there that can only be opened from your side, so if you pull to this
spot you'll have to have someone that can open the door for your
puller. If your whole group goes through the door, you can open it
from the other side by fighting a jug at the doorway and letting him
run though before killing him. 

Another good place to set up (if Trakanon isn't up) is the big room
where jumpy and the protector spawn. They have a good chance to drop
lvl 60 spells so are worth killing. If you go after them, pull the
protector first and fight jumpy close to his spawn point, He's a
gating and summoning enchanter. They're both on a 4 hour respawn
timer, from what I recall. 

Hope you enjoy the place, it was always one of my favorites. 

Rgds, Frank
