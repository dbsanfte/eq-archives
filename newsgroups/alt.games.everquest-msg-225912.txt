I'm surprised they bitch, I just put people like that on ignore. Don't 
waste your time shouting (especially), or even ooc. Use the lfg tool, 
and do something else in your spare time. The time will go faster and 
won't be total wash.

I didn't buy ldon until I *knew* I'd have 3 people I could group with. 
And now that they dropped the req to 3 I'm placated on the whole group 
requirement (my regular group was 3).

Did you copy and paste? If you copied and pasted it sucks all the effort 
out of it, and its the expenditure of effort that is therapeutic. You 
can't cheat when your venting; you only cheat yourself. :p
