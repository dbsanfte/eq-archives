I have an Athalon 1.4gig, 512RAM and a GeForce 400mx with 64 meg.  My
3DMark2001 score is 2675.  Last night I had terrible frame rates at
times in SoL.  I also get choppy framerates in both pre and post patch
Kunark (especially along the river between LOIO and FV).  According to
the MadOnion web site, the GeForce2 Ti would give me about a 50%
improvement in the 3DMark2001 benchmark score.  Would that give me a
faster framerate in SoL?  I doubt it.  The lowest framerate reported
in the benchmark testing was above 20fps.  I would be happy in EQ at
15fps (although I want 30fps!!).

That said, if I was buying a new 3D card tomorrow I would definitly
avoid the MX and look at an Ultra or Ti.  I might even consider a
GeForce3.

The worst framesrates in SoL occured when there were more than two or
three players in view.  There might be some work left to do here for
VI.  I don't think that the bottleneck in my system is my video card.
