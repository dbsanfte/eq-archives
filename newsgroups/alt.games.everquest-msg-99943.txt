NK has beetles that should be good for the Wizard.  They run slower than
player running speed, so you can kite them, if root/nuke gets boring.  In a
level or two, griffawns will be good there, too.  EK also has griffawns and
gorge hounds and dark stalkers and gnoll reavers and various spiders, which
might be slightly too high now, but in a couple of levels will be good.
Also you are getting close to where The Overthere has some good stuff.
Lavastorm is good at 15.  SRo has several orc camps that are often unused.
They are probably too low for the Wizard (I don't remember), but may be good
for the others in a couple levels.

For your other characters, make sure the Ranger keeps his tracking skill at
max.  Get the Ranger up a few levels (Misty Thicket is a good place to do
that), and then go exploring, using tracking to see what is around.  Rangers
are excellent at exploring outdoor zones: get the track window up, set to
sort by distance, and whenever the track button becomes active, hit it.
Even at your level, max tracking should be high enough to give a range much
farther than the distance you can run in the time it takes the track button
to become available again, which means you won't get any surprises when
running through a new zone (except for things that spawn near you!).

I've seen maps of most zones produced by people running ShowEQ, which gives
a snapshot of the location and level of every mob in the zone, and those
people are right who say there are plenty of great places to hunt that
almost no one uses.  A typical outdoor zone has around 200-300 mobs in it.
A long time ago, only people with ShowEQ could be really effective in many
of these zones, because finding the appropriate mobs was hard, but when
Verant changed tracking to show con colors, and changed Ranger tracking to
allow sorting by distance, these zones became great hunting grounds for
parties with a Ranger, but few people have realized this, so many of these
areas still are very underutilized.
