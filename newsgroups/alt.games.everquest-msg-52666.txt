Well, I *do* plan on leaving there soon, but being only level five, I've
been sticking in the basic newbie area where I was born to get a feel
for the class. (Totally different than any other class I've played thus
far.) Any suggestions on good zones for newbie fear kiting necros to
head to at, say, lvl 12 or so? Maybe even earlier if I can. And any good
tips on which spells to have memmed, which order to throw them, where to
park pet, etc?
