Enchant platinum: 225 mana points
And rarely do they ever bring just one bar to enchant ... unless they need
it for a quest.

And this means I should give the majority of my rez money to my group?  The
VAST majority of groups never compensating me for the Symbols I cast on them
nor give me even a fair share of the loot and bitch if I'm looting instead
of medding.

Now, yes, I realize that my cleric sets the pace of the group which means my
mana level does.  But so what?  Blame Verant for making rezzes so mana
costly and not us clerics.  This sounds like in addition to paying to be in
a group (not getting reimbursed for the Symbols I cast), I also have to pay
the group for the privilege of being a rezzer.  Even greedy stingy talent
agents only take 20% of their talent's income and not the other way around
as you're saying us clerics should do.

No, if I have to share my rez money, the druids and chanters have to as
well.  That I slow the group down because I do rezzes on the side is just
too bad.  The mana levels of druids and chanters don't set the pace for
groups.  Clerics' mana levels do.  But it isn't fair to rip me off of my rez
money because of this.  Maybe if groups compensated me for casting Symbol
AND the druids and chanters split their service fees, I'd maybe consider
this, but so far this hasn't happened.

Having said, I plan to only do rezzes while in slow groups.  And if I'm in a
group, it means -- at that moment -- XP is more important to me than plat.
And I'd probably not even do it while in slow groups as I commonly turn off
/ooc and /shout so they don't spam my message board during combat (unless
I'm recruiting more members for the group) and I do plan to go /role to
prevent rez pleas from doing likewise.
