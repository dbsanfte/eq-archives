I don't mind the percentage, in fact I wish it was more but we got
something for it. So I don't think the percentage is such an issue.

Whenever I say that people say "dude you get kunark.. SOL, etc" umm..
no.. that is all stuff I was already paying for at $9.89. 

This is NOT like your cable company. Your cable company makes cost of
living subscription increases,  or whatever the hell they call it, but
they don't really have the room to make a BIGGER increase and give you
better service. I mean, how often do you do the equivilent of
"petitioning" your cable company for a problem or how often do you
expect your cable company to provide some kind of live event in your
living room? ITs just not part of what they do. All I expect is cable
to work when I turn it on, it does, I'm happy.

EQ is totally different. There are so many other things that verant
can control besides how dependable the service is. Some of them might
cost more money. I'm perfectly fine with a price raise for that. I
would have rather them say "we are changing the rate to $16.95 so you
guys get this added value", never mentioned that 3 dollars of it was
just an increased subscription cost fee, and have me playing a better
game. 

As it is now I'm playing the same game with things seemingly getting
worse instead of better. I think the Luclin technical problems and
this price hike at such an odd time are going to go down in mmorpg
history as "Verant's folly."
