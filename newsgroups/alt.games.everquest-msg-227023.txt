This is brutal anti ranger propaganda and just not true.

Well.

Maybe a *little* true ;)

I loved being a ranger though... I saw a 'what other people think of
classes' take the other day that described rangers as the wannabes
of eq... want to outtank the warrior ,outnuke the wiz, outheal
the cleric and outpull the monk. Its true. We do all of it sort
of ok, but we die a *tonne* because, well, sometimes sort of ok
just isnt good enough ;) 

I wouldnt fret over a ranger dying really, given how quickly I could
turn aggro on I always felt death-guilt-syndrome if I let anybody
ELSE die ;) (That shoulda been me! Thats MY job!) 

Of course, I was reknowned for getting people killed (Grouping with
Sui? Take a coffin. No, take 20.), but it was generally lots of fun
doing so (hey! Wanna duo klandicar? or Whoop! Fungi king is up!
Off to solo!) and once people get used to what grouping with an
enthusiastic ranger is like they learn when to say no ;)

Absolutely. 6 deaths in 54 levels sounds unbelievable, I must have
died 15 times in some levels before I dinged, sounds like you're doing
 a bang up job of clericing. You'd have more if you grouped with
me though ;) I used to accuse clerics of not trying hard enough if they
landed heals on me while I was at more than a bubble, to the extent that
some made a point of multiple purple club memberships on my back ;)

The trick is to have fun. You won, the Ranger didnt spaz out, and 
really, you must have the best healed/died ratio of any cleric I ever
heard of.

The absolute MOST annoying thing for me was (back in the kunark days,
when I was paper thin), when a karnors keep group would be going to
crap from a train, I'd throw the flamelicks around and yell 'RUN!' and
the cleric would stay behind healing me , refusing to let me die. 

Everyone else zones out safe, then I go down, then the cleric goes
down, and then theres nobody to rez me and its wait around for a long
run back and med again. Cleric > Ranger. Cleric must live. this is
the rangers Creed ;)
