Mid levels it's debatable - Unless you want to swap in and out all the
time in exp groups, 6/65 rings are probably the best bet

High level, it's 6/65 all the way. There's rumours of a 'step' in damage
mitigation at 1300 ac, but there's also rumours that it's purely down to
the difference between your AC and the mob's ATK. Personally, I've gone
for +hp wherever the AC difference isn't too bad. I get over 500 extra
hps from +hp gear and keep stam nearly maxed at raids, leaving me with
over 5.5k hp. My target is 6khps eventually hehe
