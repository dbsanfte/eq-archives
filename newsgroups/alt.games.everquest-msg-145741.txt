Well, KC is the next step in that pickup group chain.  But my question
is, are you having fun?  Enjoying meeting random people all the time
and not becoming friends with them?  If you are having fun, then maybe
KC is for you.

My suggestion is to pick out some people you fight with in your pickup
groups that you would like to fight with on a regular basis.  After
the group breaks up, put them on your friends list.  If you see them
on in the next day or two, send them a tell:  "Heya, how's it going? 
Remember me?  That was fun the other day."  Strike up a conversation
and see if they are willing to start up another pickup group. 
Eventually, you'll pick up more people and end up becoming a regular
exp group and won't need to do pickup groups anymore.

Unfortunately, your warrior is at a difficult stage - level 49. 
You're going to spend a lot more time LFG than a 54 warrior in KC, and
DL really isn't worth your time anymore.  Furthermore, DL groups may
shy away from having a "high" level PC in the group.  So my suggestion
would be try KC for a while.  If not successful, bite your lip and try
DL.  Go into this with the objective of getting a regular exp group,
not necessarily exp.

Your guild may be able to help get you started.  All it takes is one
other person in the guild to make a group.  You can build a pickup
group with other random people from there.  You will need to take a
leadership role here.

Your cleric is still young enough to seek a regular exp group, but
that doesn't help if you're wanting to advance the warrior.

Regular exp groups are lots of fun.  You explore a lot more.  And it
puts the game in a whole new perspective.

Well, you shouldn't have to worry about pickup groups for too long as
an enchanter.  Once you get spells that better define your class,
people will value your role a lot more.  Established exp groups will
be seeking you out to join on a regular basis.  If you don't get
recruited, pickup groups will still snatch you up right away.  Even if
you are too low for the camp.  You should already know this from DL. 
How often do you see an enchanter repeat a LFG message in DL?

Paludal may be (or will soon be) a good choice for pickup groups for
your enchanter.  Exp there really is great, and pickup groups are
easy.  I've done oasis/paludal/LOIO/HHK/SK.  Paludal is the fastest
exp.  But you do have to put up with a lot of .. poor quality players.
 And it gets old fast.

If you are willing to travel the land a bit, Kurns is great.  Lots of
preparation is required, and you will be isolated for a while.  But
pickup groups are easy there.  Cash is good if you sell your bonechips
to those seeking Cabilis faction (happens frequently).  Exp is
probably on par with oasis.  Actually, I leveled my enchanter from 12
to 20 there.  Talk about isolated - I never banked my entire time
there.  Bring plenty of tiny daggars for your pets, as well as all
spells you plan on scribing in your time there.

You will need to travel to FV sometime soon for your level 16 breeze
spell.  FV is on the way to kurns!

Unrest has pickup groups from time to time.  But it is a dangerous
place due to the way trains work there.

Upper Guk pickup groups are kinda rare, in my experience.  Perhaps you
can form a group in oasis and head south.

Lastly, oasis is easy for pickup groups.  But you already mentioned
that, so you know all about it.


Good luck,
Jerem, 52 cleric, Quellious
