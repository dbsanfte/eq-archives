Sorry, no.  What you're actually doing is making unsupported self serving
statements.  I've been to every non-keyed zone in the game, as well as many of
the keyed.   I know what I am able to solo now, and what I was able to solo
back when I was 65.    It's up to you to support your own claim, not to tell
me to do it for you.

As for the skeletons you mentioned, as I remember it they are social, tightly
packed, hit 250 and have Luclin level HP / AC.   At 70 with my current raid
gear I could probably solo them, but seeing as they are light blue, there is
no point.  At 65,. I very much doubt my rogue could beat one.  She does not
have the AC necessary to make those hits land for minimum damage, nor the
regen to recover what is being taken.    Certainly she would not win in any
sort of shape to be killing more soon.
