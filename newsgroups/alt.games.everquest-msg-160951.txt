Same as a Greater Light Stone....no inherant vision improvement,
but it does shed light (as your eyes obviously don't).

Glowing stone band is good, but best for a cheap price
is Crown of King Triannix.  Gives good infravision as
well as decent stats.

Of course, two monks in my main's guild have DE masks,
so watching them kick ass is fun, and they get free UV, too...
