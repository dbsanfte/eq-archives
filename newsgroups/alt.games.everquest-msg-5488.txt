<What ever level you may be there is a world just
for your level. It's
all the same proportionately.>

Right, I've thought about that too.  Is it any
more satisfying for a lvl 35+ to take down a
griffene than for me to kill my first griffawn at
lvl 17?  Probably not.  I just need to get out of
this mindset that I need to keep moving forward
and upwards all the time.  It becomes work after a
while and games aren't supposed to be like that.
Yesterday I logged in with my stripped down shaman
at the commons tunnel and for an hour ran around
naked sowing  and healing everyone in sight.  I
got more pleasure of of doing that than anything
else and you'd be surprised at how much money you
can make on sows when you don't ask for it.  Some
guy gave me 36pp for a sow.  I was running away at
the time and he sent me a tell saying come back
for some money.

I've also had fun following a newbie around for
half an hour or so healing them while they fight
or taking a bag of fine steele weapons down to the
newbie zone and handing them out.
