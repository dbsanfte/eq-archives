Try /pause 45 (to be safe) because each digit of pause is one *tenth* of
a second, not a second. Also, you can put the pause on the same line as
another command, but you have to put it first for some bizarre coding
reason, even though you pause last. For your example:
/stand
/g Casting my uberpowerful spell_01
/cast 1
/pause 45,/sit

If you haven't maxed out Sense heading for your level yet, you may as
well stick that in as line five. (/doability 1 or whichever ability that
is). Doesn't hurt anything and will slowly help you max it out. I have
sense heading tied to most of my hot keys on all my characters.
