What makes you think that doesn't happen now?   What makes you think
two men are more likley to marry fraudulantly than a man and a woman?
What makes you think that anyone would be more, or less, likely to
form legal relationships under false pretenses than they are now?

You're really grasping at straws, aren't you?

Since you're such a great one about keeping conversations in context,
this bit is about CANADA.   You did remember that, didn't you?  So why
do you think two men would fraudulantly marry, when they can just
become common-law spouses?   What would be the point?

At least try, EQ!   Take a breath and TRY to make a reasoned argument
for once, will you?
