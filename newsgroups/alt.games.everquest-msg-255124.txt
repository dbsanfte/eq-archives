    At this point, my first question arises: Who is this zone revamp aimed
at?

    The answer appears to be: People who have 48 VT equipped people and can
bring them together for a cohesive raid force, but who don't have access to
the elemental planes.

    Is it just my imagination, or would that represent roughly 0% of the
playerbase? I mean seriously, how many non-elemental guilds have 50 people
in full VT gear? Before I cancelled my account, my guild could land roughly
30 folks on a raid, mostly 65, about half of which would be almost
approaching VT gear levels via LDoN etc, and the other half wouldn't... I
was kinda hoping the VP revamp would be for us - the guilds who certainly
CAN raid, but would never have the time investment to either get through VT
(holy crap) or bypass VT for the elemental planes. As an example of what
we're capable of, the last raid I attended, we killed Grummus (on our third
attempt).

    That said, my guild will probably gain entry to this place sooner or
later, unless their raid numbers have fallen off horridly since Exodus
(which is possible, even likely). It just seems to me that they've
mistargeted the revamp a little. The annoying part is that once again, it
sounds like several of the single groups we would normally form would have
no problem whatsoever exping in the zone and obtaining some of the cool
loot, but we're locked out because the raid force required is out of our
reach.

    The actual zone itself sounds like *Exactly* what was required to give
raiding guilds made up of people who don't have 8 hours/day for EQ a chance
to close the gap with the full-timers.

    Unfortunately, the main reason I quit the game (class balance: SK) is
not addressed by any of this, and Sony have announced that it wont be
addressed until an indeterminate time in the future. This means that I might
re-open my account at an indeterminate time in the distant future.

    My regular old group had just worked out how to win HarDoNs right before
I left - and could easily take these mobs, but would be locked out until
they gain another 20 recruits and spend 12 months raiding luclin? Thanks
Sony.
