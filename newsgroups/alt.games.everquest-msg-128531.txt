What Jews do to be hated? Well, they travel far and their culture makes them
exceptional business people ~ even to a fault. A disaster to an exceptional
business person is just another word for an opportunity to make a buck.
Famine? Well, the exceptional business person would have seen it coming and
would have stored food and then sold it at inflated prices. Simple supply
and demand really, except for the human factor.

A starving person who cannot feed his family is not going to think nicely of
any exceptional businessman making a buck of his families suffering. Then
you have money lending...

Debt have destroyed lives all through history. A country is going up the
shitter and there is a mob in the street. Who is the government going to
blame? Themselves? Nope, they are going to put the blame onto the
"outsiders" who the mob are deeply indebted to. Hey - instant popularity,
you have no debts...

It doesn't just happen to Jews either, Chinese people go through the same
thing all the time becuase they have a tight knit family units that produce
educated well off offspring that tend to be great business people too.

I do not say these views are right, I pretty much detest them actually, but
I can see where they come from. Hmmn- did I mention along the way that
exceptional business people tend to get filthy rich? Not that people get
jealous at all.... *cough*
