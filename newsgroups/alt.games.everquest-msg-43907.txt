Don't you still get xp off of black bears, black wolves and such at lvl
7? Anyway, the original poster shouldn't be worrying so much about
"finding a new hunting ground" at that level. Most any newbie area will
do. Having said that, if you *really* feel the need to travel already
and see new places, you could make the long run to the NW corner of the
Feerot and hunt the skeletons at the ruins there. That should see you to
lvl 12 nicely, there's rarely any competition for spawns in that mostly
empty zone, and you can save up backpacks full of bone chips to sell to
passing casters for a nice buck. I'm pretty sure I was around lvl 7 when
I took my troll there.
