I agree except for one thing: Teleports.  I'm tempted to buy a
a second account and have my 34 druid moved to it simply
as a self-taxi.  Having an ALWAYS ready, willing, and free
'port to any destinations can turn an otherwise 2-hour travel
time into productive exp'ing, leveling, trade-skilling, fishing,
etc. time.  I'm in a great guild that usually has a 'porter available,
and free, at that, but I'm not demanding.  If it's the least bit
out-of-the-way for the Druid/Wizard, I'll just hoof it.  Having that
always available port would be nice.
