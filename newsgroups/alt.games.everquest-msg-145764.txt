I used to think that there was something special about getting
DEX over 100 for procs, but I've changed my mind.  I swapped out
my Cougar Claws for Orc Fangs (and later Black Sapphire Electrum)
after other gear changes left my DEX under 100 even with them,
and after a lot of fighting since I've decided that procs are
just as streaky with DEX 90 as they were with DEX 103.  I'm pretty
sure that the only reason I believed in the magic 100 theory was
that I was looking for procs and noticed the streaks when I had
it over 100.  I've had quite a few big messy melees where I didn't
think I had any procs at all (especially when particle effects are
off to minimize lag) and scrolled back thru the combat spam to see
that I actually got quite a few procs in without ever noticing them
(crowd control can be a full time occupation when there's no
Enchanter or Bard in the group and you've got plate armor and Root).

But hey, it's your char.  :)  I'm not meaning to be critical in a
negative sense, just curious as to why you prefer what you do.  Do
what seems best to you and have fun with it.
