Enchanters are the class that require the most brain power.  Bards require
the best dexterity (of the player, not the character) and run a close second
for brain power required, so is probably the toughest class to play well.
Enchanters are the most powerful though.

How do you get them to understand mezzing?  Beat it into their heads until
they do.  Luckily MOST low level characters are alts of long-time players
and you won't have to educate that often.  I still have trouble getting
people to use the /assist command on occasion, and my enchanter is in his
50s.
