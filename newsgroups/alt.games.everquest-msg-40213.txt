If "who all GUILD" works, and guild affiliation displays over a
character's head and in /who functionallity, I have to assume that a
check for guild membership is already a part of the program as it
stands. While I have no idea how the game is actually coded, I would
assume that substituting the check for "personal access to the banker"
with "guild access to the quartermaster" would be fairly trivial to
implement. Of course, other things I would have thought trivial have
taken months to implement, so I'm just making a wild guess here.

As long as you're content to have one, and only one, message to the
guild, which doesn't require any reply from any other member, yes.
Otherwise, your choices are 1) talk to guildmembers who happen to be
online when you are - my guild is spread over a number of time zones,
your mileage may vary - or 2) log out of EQ to post to a webboard.
Given that the "bulletin board code" already exists, I would (again)
think that a slight alteration to this existing code would be fairly
easy to implement, but (again) I'm just guessing.
