Hmm... AGE lunatic body dragger monk... anybody we know? :-)

For rezzing I just hit F9. Overhead view - I get a better view of the
corpses this way than pretty much any other way, horse or no horse. Not
to mention the rezzees are not in the way as much. In a regular group
I usually park the horse at the bottom of a hill, which drops the horse
head out of view and eliminates almost all targetting issues - this
assumes a handy hill, of course, but such slopes are pretty common.

I've been in the situation you describe. :-) It's not nearly as painful
as all that... though admittedly I haven't had to do it nearly as often
as you have. It *is* impossible to do with the horse head up in first-
person view, which is why I F9 for it.

The only situations I've had where targeting was a pain due to a horse
head was when soloing and had to target for root/nuke/pacify/whatever.

I agree that no horse head > horse head, but the difference is not worth
1600 plat to me. And I prefer the look of the horse to the lizards.
