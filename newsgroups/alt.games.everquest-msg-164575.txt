I'm too curious to see how long it'll take you to figure out that
you're not some cool badass because you can troll a newsgroup. In
fact, like all the other trolls out there, you're a pathetic loser in
serious need of a hobby, because if trolling newsgroups gives you such
a thrill, your life is seriously lacking in the *real* pleasures. If
your so desperate for "approval" that you consider replies, even if
they're flames, to be ego boosts, something is missing in your life.
Get help. Get a girlfriend. Hell, even just a friend. Because, right
now, everyone thinks you're beyond pathetic, and you only reaffirm
this with every assinine post you make. You can scream "I'm so cool
because I can get people to shout at me and insult me!" all you want,
it doesn't change a damn thing. Look in the mirror. Are you happy with
what you see? No? Then do something about it, don't sit on your ass
and work to piss people off which merely pushes you further downhill.
