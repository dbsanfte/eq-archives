Correction. You RARELY pronounce abbreviations. Never say never :)

Example:-

"Last week I got on the phone to my local paper to place an ad for my
auto, as I have my eye on that new Chrysler. The girl who answered my
call said she was in the admin department, not sales and that
(according to the sysop) the computers were down so she couldn't take
my order. However, the sysadmin had assured her that the computers
would be up an running within the hour. Could I call her back then."

Phone is an abbreviation of Telephone, yet it is pronounced.
Ad is an abbreviation for Advertisement, yet it is pronounced.
Auto is an abbreviation of Automobile, yet it is pronounced.
Admin is an abbreviation of Administration, yet it is pronounced.
Sysop is an abbreviation of Systems Operator, yet it is pronounced.
Sysadmin is an abbreviation of Systems Administrator, yet it is
pronounced.

Okay, now I'm confused... what are we arguing about, if at all? We've
strayed so far from the original point that I'm unsure whether we are
both of the same opinion.....

If all of the above are all pronounced as "thanks", what is the harm
in using them?
