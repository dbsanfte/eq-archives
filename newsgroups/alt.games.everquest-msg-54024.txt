Putting your 1HB in the offhand will raise your 1HB skill. I had a
similar "problem" with my 52 (at the time) RNG. I've never praticed my
1HP (piercing) skill, got like 4. Just wanted to concentrate on the 1HS
since ranger epic is 1HS. On day, I got an awesome trade, I traded a
Cobalt Gauntlets for a Lupine Dagger. One of the top ten RNG weapons. I
could either sell it and get a Lammy (1HS) or pratice my 1HP which at
that point was 4. Here is how I got it from 4 to 208 in 3 days (around 9
hours playtime).

I'v played in Karnor Castle.
First I dumped my 65 pratice skill points I saved (rather forgot about
it).
Then I placed my lupine dagger 9/18 in my PRIM and in my off hand a 3/19
dagger (common) loot on Drovalg mobs in KC. While waiting to group, I
just find a group and ask the group if I can pratice my Piercing on
their pulls. I've never got a "NO" for an answer. Ideally ask for DEX
(Shamman) and HASTE (Shamman/Ench) buffs.
Bottom line, the more you swing your 1HB the fastest your skill will go
up :)

That's how I keep my skills maxed out. For instance just after I've
leveled up and while waiting to group, I usually go and find a group
with which I can pratice my skills like Offense, 1HS, Dual Wield, Double
Attack, Kick and so on and so forth on their pulls.

And no, your 1HB skill won't go up if you don't get XP from your mob.

Good luck brother Ranger!
