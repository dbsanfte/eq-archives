Err... What makes you think I don't want to march around with a firearm?  
It occurred to me after posting that, though, that it's silly, since I 
probably actually could, it's only concealed firearms that are an issue.  
And theirs aren't usually concealed.  So all in all, it's a bad example.  
But not for the reason you apparently thought. :)

}> Whether or not the cop is gay is not an issue. 
}But the fact that the cop is *not* gay is an issue for you.

Why would the cop not being gay be an issue for me?  A straight cop is 
still a cop, as far as I'm concerned, his sexuality simply isn't relevant.

}In your mind, a gay cop would *not* have any special rights
}that he didn't deserve, and *thats* the problem *I* have.

So, you're saying a gay cop has rights he doesn't deserve?  How so?  You 
think gay people shouldn't be allowed near handcuffs and firearms?

}> And yes, there were a whole bunch of gay cops in the pride parade.  
}And do *they* have special rights?  If you think so, what is your point ??

Sure, same special rights as any other cop.  They have the right to arrest 
people and march about with guns.  Thy have the right to the respect due 
to armed authority figures.

}> Quite a few straight ones there to show support for their friends, too.
}So what the fuck, do these cops have labels on their uniforms that say
}which are gay, and which are not ??  For someone who was so much
}"equality", your sure like this whole segregation thing, don't you ?

No, actually, they were riding floats that said things like 'The officers 
of 43rd precinct support our gay cops!'  And it's not about segregation, 
it was nice to see everyone all in the parade together.

}> And quite a few more there to keep anyone from starting a fight with the 
}> predictable protesters with big banners with quotes from Leviticus. 
}Gay, or non-gay ?

Given how they were ranting about how homosexuality is a sin against God 
and we're all going to burn in Hell, I'd say they were definitely 
repressing homosexual urges.  But that's just a guess.  They didn't have a 
spiffy float.
