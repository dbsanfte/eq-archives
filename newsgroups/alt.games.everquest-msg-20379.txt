Okay, I must just bypass them everytime then, because it seems to me like 
I have to run awfully far off the path to get to them.

I created an Enchanter that got rerolled (as a completely different class 
and race, true..) that way.  It was the *first* character I created, and 
I shunned the 2 page manual tossed in the corner in digust and ran around 
trying to figure out how to find this person I should give the note to.  
Then I got lost in some caves and wandered around for an hour, after 
which I fell in the water.  Then, I drowned.  Somehow, I didn't feel like 
going back and figuring out where the heck I went again :)
