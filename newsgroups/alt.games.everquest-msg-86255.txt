This should be a tinkered item, I've even figured out the recipe.

Gnomish Crossbow or Tinkered Crossbow

2  Gnomish Bolts
1  Metal Rod
1  Metal Shaft
1  Metal Twine
1  Gears
1  Skewer
1  Crafted Bow

Quality of crossbow would depend on bow used, damage would be
increased, delay would be increased by atleast 25 to 50 percent.
