    Well, no. A few changes to try and enforce it, though - and they won't
work.

    Even some of the roleplayers that wanted to move here are complaining
about some of the "features". But hopefully any stupidity will be caught
during the short beta period and acted upon.

    There are other city zones, like Skyshrine, not listed here. And of

    If heals aren't buffs, PLing is alive and well.

    Bet this gets watered down - too open to player abuse. The level 6
cleric in full Ethereal Mist is just one example of how.

    So many questions - is that game hours? Is that one point per language,
or one language point total? What language will guides speak such that
everyone can understand them at once? And given the alignment restrictions
on grouping, I imagine certain languages are effectively off limits to
certain races (unless you want to spend 100 hours training that
intermediary, then another 100 transferring that knowledge to the target
character).

    This is one of the most frequent complaints about the new server, true.
But remember what those poll numbers said - a sizeable minority was against
any form of TLC, but the majority wanted SOME type of TLC. They just weren't
certain TLC was the right way to do things. Well, I'm sure in VI's eyes (TLC
+ limited No Drop items) is a brand new type of loot restriction, and one
that's at least worth testing. But I don't think VI realizes what they're in
for with this....

    One of the unstated goals of any new server has to be to minimize the
effort VI needs to put into maintaining the server. They don't have the
manpower to put out an error-free patch, new content beyond expansions, or
to clean up existing bugs - from where will the manpower to deal with a new
ruleset's issues come? TLC plus limited No Drop causes a whole bunch of
issues to be raised. ALL quests now need to be re-evaluated, and adjusted,
to fit under TLC. ALL high-end gear needs to be evaluated to see if it is
desirable/required to tag it No Drop. That is a TON of work - and it won't
be done, people will become upset when "their" quest cannot be done, and
overall customer satisfaction will drop yet again. Because VI still hasn't
learned that they can't churn out crap.

    This was something that actually has been broken since the Beta, which I
gather they always wanted to fix. It also means that quests requiring a
great deal of travel as part of the difficulty will get SOME of the
difficulty restored to them, as long as neither end of the trip is in a
city. But, really, this isn't what will kill a number of Kunark and Velious
zones - the alignment restrictions on grouping do that to a far greater
degree. Now, more than EVER before, it's crucial to go someplace busy if you
want to get a group. Since now there's a bunch of people you can't group
with. Exploration of underutilized areas will be a BYOG affair.

    Karnor's is not a good example. It's pretty close to Firiona Vie. Evils
won't go there - in fact, I'd be surprised to see any evils in Kunark except
perhaps in The Overthere or Lake - but it'll be a prime spot for
good/neutral characters.

    The whole "starting over" thing is another problem. Roleplayers are into
character development. So why NOT allow transfers one-way only to the FV
server, only one per account ever? Breaks up the stupidity of the first day
rush, with a hundred people fighting over each Large Rat spawn point. Allows
people to continue being whoever it is they were, and at the proper level of
ability (TLC, so no bottom-feeding possible to re-equip). It also strongly
discourages the power mongers who'd want to "pwn" a new server - no point in
playing a character 24/7 if there's already high levels there, and no reason
to assume your guild would be the only ones moving there. The one possible
issue is people sending "Farm Aid" characters loaded down with farmed gear
for sale/trade on the new server - but given that every character transfer
is SUPPOSED to be reviewed anyways, how tough could it be to weed these out?

    Arlopin would have been proud last night. A bored Ragefire group spotted
Efreeti Lord Djarn on track, and sent a monk that pulled him and pretty much
everything between him and Nag's Lair back to the Ragefire group. My Nox
group moved out of the way to let the pull go through, and the Imp casting
messages were still scrolling by at a hefty clip. I hope they post
screenshots somewhere. 8)
