180 JC isn't that bad - about 2-3 hours and 2Kpp if you have decent CHA,
probably less if you can enchant the bars too (although if you're a chanter
you're probably 250 JC anyway). And hey, maybe if you find yourself a couple
of blue diamonds and get a chanter to enchant a couple of electrum bars you
can make yourself some ear-rings :).

Fletching? Yeah, well. At least it should be cheaper than jewellery to get
to 190 or so, total waste of time for a pure caster though.
