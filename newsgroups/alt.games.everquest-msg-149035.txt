I can't speak for the industry as a whole, but, when I looked into it,
software engineers doing games were generally far less well compensated than
those working in other areas of the industry.  I did work in the video game
and video gambling industry for a while, and the compensation was nowhere
near as good as it has been in any of the other parts of the software
industry I have, and do work in.

I am sure there are exceptions to this, but, as a generalization, it seems
to be true from my experience, and from talking to others regarding their
experiences.  As such, you generally, cannot expect to find the topnotch
software engineers working in that industry, as they can do far better for
themselves elsewhere.  This is not to say that all gaming software engineers
suck, and all others are great, far from it, I am certain that there are
plenty of excellent software engineers working in the gaming industry, and I
know for a fact there are plenty of lousy ones working in other industries.
