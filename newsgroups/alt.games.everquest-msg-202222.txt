Hi,

I have a account where PoP is enabled but not Luclin. I went to the store
and Luclin was not avaible but only a package called the New Dawn ( Europe
version) in the hope there was a single key for Luclin.

I have opened the box and see there is one key for all the expansions (
Luclin, Kunark, Velius) but does anyone know if this key also works to
activate only the luclin part on a existing account? I could not try it yet
because I am still at my work atm ;-) , otherwise I can no go back to the
store and hopefully they will change the box for the gold edition.

Thanks,

Nico
