We just had a Wedding last weekend that was a blast.  We also get together
to hunt or hang out whenever possible.  We are a 'young' Guild, none of our
members is over lvl 40 I don't believe, so we don't do huge terrifying raids
just yet.

We do have a blast however cutting up and chatting and helping each other
whenever and wherever we can.
