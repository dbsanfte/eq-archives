My rogue bought Tboots and I've had very little trouble keeping the SoW
effect up between fights.  It's a simple matter of establishing routine.
When I'm not in 'fight mode' I have to remember it now and then, and even in
the worst of times when something has popped up and attacked, I have been
able to get the tboots (1.5sec) off during a fight.  I also try, when
travelling, to renew sow before each zone (which helps me if I'm zoning into
a dungeon zone)
