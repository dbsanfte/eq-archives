Yup, because one of the points of an MMORPG is to provide a fantasy world
where people can escape from those RL differences.

This doesn't mean that it won't also hurt the in-game economy.  Scarce items
that many people want could easily end up being only available for RL money.
People who want them for plat would them have to farm a huge amount of plat,
sell it for RL money, and use that to buy the item.  (Except that might not
work...if buying/selling items for RL money were widespread, the value of
plat would go down, and it might not be feasible to ever raise enough plat
to sell in RL for money to buy good items).
