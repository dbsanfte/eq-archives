I believe it does.

Both will raise. Your primary hand will take a swipe every time, while your 
offhand will only take a swipe some of the time. Thus, your primary will 
raise faster.

The Attack Ratings are completely different, althoughg  bare fisted they 
are similar until 27 or so. After 27 you start to get Damage Bonuses which 
only apply to your primary hand.

No. Your primary and off hand are unrelated. your offhand will *TRY* swing 
every 3.5 seconds regardless of what you wield in Primary.
