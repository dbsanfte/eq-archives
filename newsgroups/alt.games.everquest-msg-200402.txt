Well, about a month or so ago, I asked in this group if
it was possible to duo Kelorek`Dar in Cobalt Scar with
a 63 Warrior/Shaman combo.  Well, I know it is possible
with a 65 Warrior/Shaman combo now :)

Last night with nothing to do, I decided to check what
names are up (Lodizal, Gaurdian Wurms, Fellspine,
Kelorek`Dar etc...).  Upon zoning my druid into CS and
checking track, I noticed Kelorek'Dar was up....after
changing my shorts cause I've never seen him up ever
I picked up my brother(65 War) and my shaman we zoned
into CS and buffed up on the beach.

If anybody has ever pulled him you'll know he's a bitch
to get to.  I used the druid to track him and target him
then casted a dd to get his attention...immediately he
nuked my 53 druid with 1000 points stunning her and beating
on her with 200+'s.  I make it to shore with 2% health
and died on the beach.

So at this point my brother and I engage with our mains.
He was easy to slow, landed first time everytime (had to
slow him about 6 or 7 times throughout the fight).

Anyways, after about 30mins of healing and canni5'ing
and epic dotting he goes down.

What was even more exciting than killing a named lvl 65
dragon with two people was that he dropped two CoCW's and
a Bio Orb (some crap spells too).  Woohoo :)

Thanks for all the advice on the original post, it came
in handy.
