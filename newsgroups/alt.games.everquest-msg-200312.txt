Whats wrong with botting?

If I sacrifice some control of my monk to play my shaman, or enc, work
myself more to run extra chars.. wheres the problem?

I made the decision... after countless hours, days, months of /LFG ON,
during my leveling up, that from now I would become more self sufficient.
That if I couldn't find a group, Id make my own.

So if i have the patience, determination and hardware to support 2, 3 or
even 4 characters, not to mention the extra account costs, why shouldn't I?

I have no doubts my botted chars do a lot less than "mains".... thats the
price I pay to not have to sit for hours finding key classes, having to
group with fuckwits, or have to make a soloing class (thats not enjoyable
for me)
