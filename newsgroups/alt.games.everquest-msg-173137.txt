The thing that most folk in the US is that what happened on the 11th
of September was a reaction to the US' interference in the world.  We
have watched the US foreign policy for years over here in Europe and
have wondered when the hell someone is going to realise that someday
someone is going to get really upset.

We were hoping that the American people would finally realise what was
being done in their name was intolerable to countless of millions of
people.  My wife, an American, hadn't a clue what was happening in the
world in her name until she went to live in Europe.  It didn't take
her long to find out why, as an American, people were wary of her.

She realised that the news and information on CNN, NBC etc contains no
real news nor information.  When she first started to see the BBC
(British Broadcasting Corporation) on Belgian television she hated the
hard hitting and inquisitorial news programs when journalists would
grill the politicians.

It was only when she realised that in the US none of this happens.
CNN and the rest of them tends to keep the news away from the people.
Which is a shame as she later realised that if the people of America
were told what is going on in their name then a lot of the US' foreign
policy would stop.  She would be on the phone to her family at regular
intervals what was going on at home.   Simply because her family
didn't know and would never know if the US media had their way.

What is the score now?  24 state inspired coups since the end of the
second world war?  Not many Americans I speak to when I am on my
travels there realise it's that high.  Nor do they realise that the US
has been indicted by the UN for their actions and that they have
refused to allow UN Weapons Inspectors into the US.

When it comes to Iraq our UK government are no better than yours.  In
our name we have sold weapons and plants to Iraq.  Look at the
Churchill-Matrix affair when Bush Snr was in power.   Obviously the UK
government knew about the supergun; they even approved it.

The difference is that despite Blair's protestations we know it is
nothing but oil that this war is going to be fought over.

So, please be very careful when you cast doubts upon people's
statements about the reasons of the war; any war.  Like the second
worls war this one is about pure economics otherwise we wouldn't be
bothered.  At the moment America has three options:
1.  Reduce the oil consumption and this would make people overseas
happier if they did as then they could ratify the Kyoto Treaty which,
I think, the US is the only one refusing to sign.
2.  Run out of oil in the very near future and face a breakdown of
American Society
3.  Go and look for some oil...

Option three is about to be undertaken in yours and mine names.

Regards
  Malc

p.s. As someone who has taken the "queen's shilling" I have every
appreciation of the poor sods going out there.
