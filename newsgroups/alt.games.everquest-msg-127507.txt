hey, they did finally finish the BL epic :)

Of course, the question many mages have is -
now that we've found a powerful use for AA 
mage skills - how long until they say that was
NOT intended and nerf it?

quick rundown - 59 mage spec'd conjuration,
with SCM 3, Quick Summoning 3, Elemental pact,
an enshrouded veil (summoning efficiency 3)
and improved reclaim.

Now, mage summons a DDD pet (base cost
350 mana, 8 sec base cast time).

Spec Conj + SCM3 + Veil saves over 100mana.
Improved reclaim returns almost 350 mana.
Cast time with QS3 is 4 seconds.  With an
instant cast reclaim energy item, you can
get at least 14 of these per minute.

I've heard of mages going near oom to FM in
~2minutes.

Worse - we have the best mana transfer spell
in the game (MR2) which costs 400mana base,
but a little over 300mana spec conj+scm3.
Give the mage KEI+TPP (Mage self only mana
regen) + MC3 and he's pushing nearly 4 of these
rods per minute.  A cleric in a decent guild
can easily turn 2 rods into 1k mana net - 
Clerics from more uber guilds can eat 3 then
CH (just under 1700 mana net) and one who can
eat 4 without low health aggro can get 2300+
net from them.  That cleric (needs 5k hp raid
buffed.  Since I know of MAGES with 4k raid
buffed hp - I'd say that's very possible) is
getting 230mana per tick from a single mage.
An epic wizzie gets the full 2640 mana 
from the 4 rods, but probably can't burn
it as fast as the mage makes it.

Personally I think they'll have to do something
about it.  Yes it takes fairly constant button
pushing - but with the correct setup not any
worse than a 3 song twist for bards.  In fact,
I could probably put the entire thing on one
button on my strategic commander and continously
drop rods on one machine while actually playing
my 2nd account cleric on the other.

That is just plain nuts.
