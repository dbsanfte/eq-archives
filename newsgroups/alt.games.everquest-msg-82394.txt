There was one poor sap on my server who had the name benladen (or some
similar misspelling) prior to the attacks. He claimed it was sheer
coincidence - I figure he'd heard the name peripherally somewhere and
it stuck in his head, but he wasn't really aware (as most Americans
weren't) of who binLaden was.

He was pretty frantic to get it changed after 9/11. I recall he even
announced to the zone that they should quit sending him tells, he'd
already petitioned himself over it.
