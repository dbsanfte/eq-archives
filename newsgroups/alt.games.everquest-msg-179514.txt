For one thing, wages have gone up. Also, from all the expansions that
have come out, the number of individual machines running each server
has gone up. The more information each server farm is processing, the
more it takes to keep it up. I shouldn't need to cite jack, this
should all be rather intuitive to anyone who would understand anything
I did dig up...
