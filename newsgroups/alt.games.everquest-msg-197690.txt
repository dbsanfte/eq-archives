Prove that this was the case.   Or at the very least, offer some support
which you feel is more compelling than the observation of people who were
actually there.

In the absence of such compelling support, I will continue to hold to my
opinions about what I witnessed.

Now you're getting wishy washy... you're not even saying that I'm wrong,
just that we shouldn't believe my assessment of the situation because it's
*possible* that I was wrong?

So then you never believe anything when there is a possibility it might be
wrong?
