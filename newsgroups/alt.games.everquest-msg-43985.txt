EQ is a very group-oriented game, but... don't expect to just jump in 
and start grouping straight away. All classes are more efficiently 
soloed out of the "rat-killing" levels, up to 6-7 or so (and much more 
so if they are secondary characters of a veteran player, and thus with 
high-level equipment). Trying to group before then, unless you are 
doing it for roleplaying purposes (and in that case, I'd recommend 
waiting for the upcoming role-playing server) is a waste of your time 
and theirs, and you won't find many people willing to do it.
