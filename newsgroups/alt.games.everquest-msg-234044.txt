There are three major reasons IMHO:
1. The person behind the char is a moron/10 years old.
2. The person behind the char bought the char on EBay.
3. The person behind the char is one of the increasing "levelled to 65 in 5
days played" crowd whose only aim each time they play is getting into an XP
group in a high-exp zone, and never really testing their class's abilities
or figuring out the abilities of the other classes thus learning how to
group effectively without the PerfectGroup (TM).
