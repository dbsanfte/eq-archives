Playing styles range all over.  As would be expected the PvP server 
players spend much more time in PvP but even on the PvE servers some 
people spend substantial amounts of time in PvE, and some spend none.  
The amount played ranges from very casual, a couple of hours on the 
weekend (many of the quests can be done in under 2 hours), to full blown 
living on the server (commoner on the PvP servers) I would have to say 
that most people are more casual than you would have seen in EQ at the 
same stage of development.  The shear number of players, just passed 4 
million, http://www.blizzard.com/press/050829-wow.shtml , and the limited 
number of hard core gamers makes that hard to avoid.

Blizzard is scurrying to provide more top end encounters in instances.  I 
don't think they were prepared for the shear number of players and the 
rate at which some of their player base would level.  But they are 
steadily adding new content while constantly fighting with the server 
loads.   They are in the same predicament as the red queen; they're going 
to have to run to stay in place.

And to get anywhere they're going to have to run twice as hard. ;-)
