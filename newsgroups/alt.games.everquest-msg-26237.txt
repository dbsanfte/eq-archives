Yeah, I was going to try to point that out, but any serious "Verant Rules
Lawyer" on here could find room to arue it to death.  If you take away the
amateur lawyering, it's pretty sadly obvious.
  From the naming rules: (which can be found at
http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/policies/naming.jsp):
"For all of the above, misspellings and alternative spellings of the word
or words are also unacceptable."
That one right there should sink it, but a true Rules Lawyer will say "Hey!
It says *for all of the above* and spoonerisms weren't *specifically* ruled
out above."

There's also the very first paragraph, which opens with:
"Character names in EverQuest should reflect the genre of the game.
Original, high-fantasy names are desired. These guidelines apply both to
first names and to surnames, and also to the combination of first name and
surname."

Anybody who could try to stake a serious claim that, from a common sense
point of view (exluding any amateur Rules Lawyers) that a spoonerism of
"Big Ole' Titties" could reflect "original high-fantasy names" needs some
serious therapy.

And then, there's good ole' rule 1, right at the front, which, in part,
states:
"Vile, profane, rude, or racist names including common swear words,
anatomical references..."
The obvious nature of "Big Ole' Titties" being an anatomical reference
would make me think that, if challenged, a GM wouldn't spend too much time
listening to a Rules Lawyer trying to claim the rules weren't specific
enough to disallow it. They'd just delete the surname to make it suddenly
unoffensive and move on.

Then again, I really don't give a rat's ass, as it certainly wouldn't
offend me. It was pointed out by a female guildmate as being offensive to
her, and a violation of the rules.  I seriously doubt it will get
challenged though, and matters not to me if it does or doesn't.
