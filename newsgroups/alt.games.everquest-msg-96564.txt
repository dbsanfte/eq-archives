So I'm happily pulling mobs to my group at the NRuins in DL, merrily
chaining away, when all of a sudden this guy pops over and says "ready
for a train?".  We had just finished the mob I'd pulled over, so I'm
like, "whatever" and took the two mobs off his hands, thinking he was
having problems.  We wasted the mobs, and he says "Train me again..."
Insert sound of jaw hitting floor.  Frankly, as a 47 ranger, my
pulling has developed to the point where I do NOT train.  If I'm
soloing, and run into problems, I ALWAYS give a warning shout,
specifying zone, etc, and in this case, I was FAR from in trouble.
Full group with a chanter, any extra mobs I picked up would just be
mezzd.  Anyway, trying to figure out what this guys problem is.  He
says he went AFK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FUNKING ZONE! And
when I ran by with my pulls, one aggrod him.  OK.  Fine.  First off, I
say I didn't see him.  Second of all, what the hell was he doing afk
in the wide open of DL?  He STILL couldn't see that there was any
problem on his part, and it was all my fault.  THEN after starting
this all up with SERIOUS attitude, is annoyed that I didn't apologize.
Oh, it gets better.  He's level freaking 60!!  How do you get to level
60 and believe it's ok to go afk in the middle of a zone like DL?
Anyway, if anyone knows an officer of the guild Flame (or maybe Fist,
I'm not sure) of Vengeance, server Morelle Thule, please inform said
officer that Auroch or somesuch is a dick.  Yes, I'm being petty.
Thanks for listening.
