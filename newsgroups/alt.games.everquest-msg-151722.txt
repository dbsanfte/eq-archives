Unless you've been hunting Luclinite guards, etc. messing up some
factions, you should be fine. Troll shammy in our guild did it with no
issues and did no faction work on Luclin ever aside from the Trade
Commisioner Henry thing, and I doubt that has any influence on Rebecca
Cabbageleaf.  My wife's DE necro has it also. I think Rebecca pays no
mind to race or Norathian politics.
