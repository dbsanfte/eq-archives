Mangina? Are you actually concerned about what sex a person is in real life?
What difference does it make whether the player is male or female unless you
are trying to chat them up or are perving at their digital cleavage
something. Either way - the issue is yours and not the person playing the
character.

Half the characters I play are female and I can assure you I am not trolling
for cybers or one hand navigating either. The only factor that comes in to
play are what type of character am I making and how am I going to be playing
it? Thick headed mellee types tend to be male where as something more subtle
would be made female - ie, a rogue. Caster types a wizard I would make male
but a enchanter I would make female. The choice of sex is just a constant
reminder to me of how I should be playing the character: aggressive or with
subtlety. Conversly - if I were to make a troll or ogre they would be female
regardless of class because they are so gloriously ugly and well my sense of
humour is twisted that way.

When on female characters I have only had a handful of tells of guys
assuming I am a real life female and I just reply: "I am a middle aged fat
balding bloke with a toupee if you must know." just to clear the air. If you
think there is something wrong with males playing females and vice versa, I
really think it reflects more on your own issues than that of the
"crossdresser" in question.
