No.  Whoever does the largest portion of damage gets
100% of the experience.

However, everyone who even *touches* a mob, or heals/buffs someone
who is fighting it, or even just gets on the "hate list" by
standing nearby when it's KoS to you, gets the full faction
changes.

Just make sure that if you do damage the mob in any way,
you don't do more than the newbies fighting it will have
done to it by the time it dies.  Generally speaking, if
whatever you do wouldn't knock a healthy orc down to
below half health all by itself, then you won't be
stealing exp from anyone if you use it during fights.

One bow shot shouldn't be a problem.  Or, you can just Snare
every Orc you see someone fighting, which will also give
you full faction adjustments, and at the same time be a
big help to the newbies.
