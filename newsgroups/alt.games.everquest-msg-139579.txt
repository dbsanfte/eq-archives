You mean volume based? 

It sucks, especially as the most economical way to
go is sign up for 18mths. I'm hoping there will be
an unlimited download plan from some of Bigponds
competitors soon, thereby forcing them to offer
the same.

Having said that, I do have a bigpond account, and
I don't seem to have those troubles you mention.
Nor does anyone else I know. Maybe you should get
onto customer service.

As I said, it sucks. Doesn't take long to reach
that download limit.
