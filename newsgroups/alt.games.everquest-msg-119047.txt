Fight fire with fire I say. Tell him to stop it or you will be very 
annoying back. If he does not listen then why not run around and 
slaughter all the giants you can see just to prevent this guy from 
getting ANYTHING? This should get up his nose quite a bit and eventually 
he will grow tired of trying, then leave. This also gives you more 
satisfaction than complaining to a GM about it.

Again, I wouldn't bother. If they are stealing your pulls you have the 
right to continue fighting it and getting the exp. If they complain then 
tell them where to get off.

I had something similar happen to me in Everfrost while soloing mammoths 
with my mage in my 20's. I would do the usual and let my pet attack 
first, then I would stand back and nuke. A higher level shaman decided 
he wanted all the mammoths he could find to himself, including the ones 
I had attacked first, and since he had SoW and was higher level he would 
race up to my kill and do enough damage to take 50% of the hitpoints 
before me. At first I thought he may not have seen my pet attacking so I 
let it be, but after a while it became blindingly obvious he was KSing. 
I had a few words to him to no avail. So I decided to keep annoying him 
as much as I could with /tells, firebuffing the mammoth etc but it 
didn't help much. I then decided to keep as far away from him as 
possible, but while looking for more mammoths I noticed him beside a 
corrupted mammoth. Upon closer inspection I noticed it was his corpse. I 
send a nice sarcastic /tell to him to provoke him about it and he 
finally cracked and went off at me. I felt a lot better after that ;)

I think a lot of people in life fail to recognise what goes around comes 
around. This goes the same for EQ. If I ever overtake this guy in 
experience and find him hunting anywhere I am I would steal his kills 
just to spite him in revenge.

Bear a grudge? Who me?
