I see below it doesn't work on your machine (meaning you have tried to use
it, lokai and a few others also)

But its not really the kind of thing you would expect people to talk about
in-game... afterall who really knows if Verant do filter for words such as
Sins, Seq, Eqw etc.

I recall when the last version of Eqw stopped working, there was a massive
thread on prexus.com about it.. all sorts of people complaining it was
faulty..   the eqw thread on hackerquest has a lot of posts too
