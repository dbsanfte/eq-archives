Actually, as I didn't put any argument in the thread, that goes out, I
simply made the assertation that Paladins and Shadowknights have the
same defense caps, you whined No they don't, I produced proof, and you
whined oops but Shadowknights suck n3way.  Personally I couldn't care
less, as I don't play a Shadowknight.  

But If I was GL, and we were needing a tank, I'd pick a SK over a PAL.  

Why? Well because SK's remember that they are tanks, and Paladins think
they are healers and don't like to get all bloody.  And for some reason
they have Crappy AC, something about forgetting to get their agility up
to 75.
