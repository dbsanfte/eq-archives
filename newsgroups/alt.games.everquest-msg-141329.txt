 Exactly.. there are different shades of "swearing" or the use of obscenities.
For instance, if a puller in the group has a little problem and blurts out
"oh crap", I am going to want my filter OFF so I know what he said. That one
utterance , "oh crap" tells me lot whereas, "oh kshu" does not. An occasional
light swearing in guild or group is ok with me, however, a level 3 newbie
shouting "OH GOD DAMMIT SHIT FUCK PISS YOU GODDAMNED WHORE YOU TRAINED ME
AND KILLED MY ASS I AM GONNA HUNT YOU DOWN AND KILL YOU FUCKING MORONS".
 
 Lets not forget that there ARE children that play this game, possible 
their parents' machines that MAY have the filter off for the same reason
I do. Shouting irresponsible, disrespectful obscenities over an entire 
zone or chat channel is way out of line but I can handle it ok if it's
confined to smaller audiences.
