At 55 on my mage I was in plenty of raids where my pet wasn't allowed -
I couldn't nuke more than twice on most mobs before they died.  

Interesting thing now is that most high end mages say they are aggro
constrained on raid mobs - and since they don't have a concussion like
spell they are seriously outdamaged on mobs where pets are (*STILL*) 
not allowed.
