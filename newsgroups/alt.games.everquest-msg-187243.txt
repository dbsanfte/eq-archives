I've been hunting the Wandering Greenbloods and goblins in BB for the blood
vials, heads and medallions.  Lately, I've picked up a stack and a half of
spider silk, on an "opportunity" basis, as I hear that pays pretty well.
Last night, I decided to go on walkabout, and see where some of these camps
were.  I found AG 1 and 2, and I suspect what some people call AG3 is the
little hut out by the coast.  Of course, I go and look just as they make it
no longer worth it.

Killed one of the little blue buggers.  Not real exciting.  No nearly as
exciting as as rooting a Wandering Greenblood, and having root break just as
Qued shows up.  For a level 13 Wizard, that's a challenge. ;-)

Cheers,
Eric
