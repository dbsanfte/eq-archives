Enchanters hate making mana vials. At lvl 56 I have approx 2450 mana.

Spell Thicken mana: 200mana and 6 seconds to cast.

From full mana to OOM I will make 12 vials taking approx 2-3 minutes then
have to med again.

I charge 200pp for a stack, components included, I can buy the pearls and
vials cheaper because of the higher charisma we enchanters have to have.
This gives me a profit for my time of approx 60pp. I generally only make
them for guildmates at component cost as they are such a pain to make. I
would suggest asking a guild chanter before /auction WTB

Languages list you gain with level I believe, Put one prac point into the
langugage you want to learn then have someone group with you who can teach
you a languge and basically set up a social to spawm text and then just keep
spamming over and over until learnt, doesnt take long. Bot journeys are best
for this

No trainer teaches you a language only gives you a chance to put some prac
points in. I heard from someone you can set the lanugue default to the one
you want to learn and then keep zoning and your skill goes up, never tried
it as it is a pinful thing to do
