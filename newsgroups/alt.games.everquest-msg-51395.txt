Cracked staff is an uber one-hander for the below 10 non-twink
crowd.  One handed.  As in you can dual weild 'em.  With
my iksar illusion sometimes I'll have one in each hand and Instill
Doubt while in the EC tunnels auctioning.  Looks like an Iksar
monk...

Sells for a plat, too.  Also not bad for a 1HB dropping off of
level 1 decaying skeletons.  Were you laughing at your own
lack of knowledge?
