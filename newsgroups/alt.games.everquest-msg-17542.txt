Not to be an ass, but if I start a new char in Gfay I usually hunt those lvl
1 bees from the start. They have an uncommon drop of venom sacks which yield
3gp at vendors. Plus, of course, I collect bat wings (lvl 1) and bone chips
(lvl 1) but stacks take a while to fill up. Usually after an hour or 2 I
have almost full cloth of the orcs, 3 or 4 backpacks and sometimes a
tailoring kit depending on it being a prim caster (druid, mage, enc, etc;
spell cost: no kit) or sec one (rang, palli, etc; no spell cost: kit).

As a side note: I love the bandage skill. I even try to get it up if I play
a cleric. Just solo critters and don't heal yourself until the last moment.
You can make bandages out of 2 silk threads, which in turn can be created
out of 2 spider silks. Free bandages from low mobs :)
