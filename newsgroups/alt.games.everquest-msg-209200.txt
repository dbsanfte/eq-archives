    When I'm casting blast heals, it's because someone is being beaten down
so hard that I don't have time for anything else. If I did have time, I'd be
using SE or CH. So there is no "time as if I won't get a crit". When folks
are getting beat down that fast, they usually have all sorts of space for
the crit to do full healing. And if I do get full healing, I have a much
better chance of being able to switch to a proper heal, like CH.

    Oh, and Monual has SCRM, which is why I didn't list it.
