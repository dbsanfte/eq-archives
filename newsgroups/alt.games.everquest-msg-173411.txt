No, the difference is that Palestinian terrorists use destruction to effect
terror, hence the name.  This is also why the innocent (in busses, cafes,
restaurants) are specifically targetted in the majority of Palestinian
attacks.  Israel, by contrast, targets quasi-military targets among the
Palestinians and is not motivated by a desire to generate terror among its
targets, but rather to stop those targets from planning and carrying our
more attacks on civilians.  Israel does have a record of killing innocents
in its attacks, I'll grant you, but these deaths are an unwanted side effect
of the mission, and not the predominant reason for it.  That's the big
difference between the two sides.
