Good policy, especially given no backpops. For melees though the rez is 
worth it.

I have had precisely one person die in LDON. Admittedly, I have only been 
on two missions. The person that died did so because he decided to wander 
off exploring (!) while I was AFK in the pisser. God, I love rangers.

He was also one of those rangers that thinks his Taunt button is there to 
be pressed. I was healing him literally every battle, and literally more 
often than I was healing the MT (who was a BST with roughly equivalent HP 
and AC but 5 levels higher than the RNG).

I was meleeing last night and nuking a bit(as a cleric). Most notably, when 
a mob started to cast I would bash then cast Stun. We interrupted a *lot* 
of casters last night.
