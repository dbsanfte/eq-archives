If you are talking about the quest to get 4 larva, then it is really
not hard.  I have done it twice.  I also heard that one person can get
6 flagged when they turn in the larva. 

This quest was the easy way to get a group of sub 60 to tier 2 and
getting level 65  with out going to trials.

 If I zone into CoD on my server I would be the only one in that zone.
I know now that the zone will be flooded when they open the gates.  I
have never been to a trail because I never needed to.
