Couldn't agree with you more. Since Everquest was released, the dev team
has shown a tendancy to always apply bandaid fixes to classes which end
up altering the class enough that it should be extended down into the
lower levels to make the class play similarly. The ranger jolt spell was
a bandaid for the poor defense skills of rangers in Kunark. The probable
reason then for not extending the jolt line lower was that rangers up to
50 had similar defense tables to warriors and access to armor at that
time with very similar protection. However, as the game has progressed,
mobs hit harder at low levels in the "good" experience zones, low level
warrior armor has gotten better while ranger armor hasn't as much, but
the agro dumping spells haven't been extended to lower levels.

The same lack of consistancy existed in the bard when the game came
out. Bards got one charm spell in their 20's which stopped working on
mobs higher than L39, so any bard that had come to use the charm spell
as part of their repertoir(sp) had the fun of having the skill taken away
from them once they hit their mid 40s. Meanwhile to compound this, 6 of
the 8 songs in the 40's (there wasn't even 1 song per level on release
for the 40's) were completely broken, or worthless. This was all
eventually fixed for the bards but not before a lot of early bards I
knew on my server, including me, abandoned our characters for one that
worked at high levels.
