256MB as a min would be the highest ever seen in a video game to date. I do
enjoy EQ, but I'm really starting to lose confidence in the developers when
I see such a high requirement. Being a developer myself, it's quite obvious
EQ developers just don't know how to program effeciently. They aren't making
good use of Direct X and a lot of the features graphics card now support.
Given that EQ is not that graphically intense in the first place, my overall
judgement is the developers are extremely inexperienced in game development.
