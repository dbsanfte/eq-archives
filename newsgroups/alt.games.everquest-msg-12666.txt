Hello again. After a whole whack of problems after the last patch I found
out they were due a fried computer and not the patch. Now that I have a new
one I am wondering where in the eqclient.ini file one can turn on these
new(er?) monk textures I always heard about but couldnt use? I've tried
using a an editor for it, but saw nothing about them.
