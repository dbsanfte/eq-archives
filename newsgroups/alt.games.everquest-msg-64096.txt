Having logged in two in last hour  Major Caution playing a bard today with
Luclin, our songs are not working or work in and out, like selos. I can not
sit and med with heal song, and we have casting time delays on some of our
songs. LOL
I was about to do Oooc with 5 people in GD with me but few bards telled me
as confirmed it as well.

Be carefull not too sure they reimburse your exp for this grave ways to die.
Guardians are killing people, font is out of boxes, auto crash when zoning.
Do yourself a favor and save stress tonight, I know easy to say for someone
seen it with own eyes but stay on tonight is asking for trouble.


Good note graphics are amazing, change to just one mob I see, dire wolves is
profound. I just wish was reason to stay higher then 1024x768 but with text
and boxs so very small its just wasted eye candy, sadly.
