Of course, they would have to continually buy new games and set up new
accounts to do it, paying $30 a month instead of $10, and having to restart
thier characters repeatedly instead of continuing playing...


Much more likely that Verant realized something that DAoC didn't.   People are
lazy.  At the end of the free month, if you have to go back and spend the
extra effort to enter your account info, some people will just say "Eh, I
didn't like the game that much anyways."  Whereas if you get it in advance,
some people will say "Eh, I don't hate the game that much, I can always cancel
next month."

Yep, they now have these in the stores too.  3 month prepaid card.
