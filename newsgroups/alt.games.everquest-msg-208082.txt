/sigh
Kick out an animation, haste it, then do your PBAOE stuns.  It's valuable to
learn this technique when you've got a healer standing by - No, you CANT
just fire the AOEs as fast as they refresh, you have to time it so they go
off as the previous stun ends.  Yes, you'll get hit and the DS will do it's
work - but it's a chance to learn a damned essential skill (and get used to
timing casts so you can get a stun off while being beaten on).

Mez useless until 20?  Please tell me if you ever make a chanter on Xegony,
so I can get the /ignore list updated right away.  Not only is mez a
lifesaver, the AOE mezz at 16 is an essential tool - and hard to learn how
to use it properly.  Or are you going to do what all the other PLd chanters
do, wait until you're on a Chardok Royals raid in your mid fifties to learn
skills you should have mastered thirty levels before?

And yes, even when you first get your first mesmerisation, it's damned
useful for splitting.  Two mobs standing close, mez one, the other comes
in - hand off to melee, then go back and wait for the mez to break and your
second pull is coming in ready to be re-mezzed.  Once you get memblur, it's
even easier.

Tash is also far longer-ranged than 90 pct of the enchanter spells.  And if
you're grouping with others of like level, the MR reduction will really help
magic-based nukes, slows, snares...

Haste isn't brain surgery - but sometimes the chanter has to learn when to
use which haste.  Your best haste isn't always the best choice, especially
in melee-heavy groups.  And sometimes you have to let the melees go
unhasted - CC is an enchanter's first job, not buffing melees.

You've finally said something I agree with.  Enchanters need to learn when
and how to slow; often, a root before you slow will be a big help at lower
levels.  Also, if you're grouped with an SK or Paladin, an enchanter CAN
slow off the bat.  But the enchanter has to learn how to judge their melees
too!

Whirl is broken by melee, but if you realize it's really a targeted stun, it
becomes obvious that it also will interrupt mob casting.  After the second
time a priest-class add heals the warrior-class mob your group is wailing
on, you'll learn to treasure WTYH.  It should be noted I was using WTYH and
DDD (Dyn's Dizzying Draught) last saturday in an XP group - in Torment.  As
the sign over the simulator room in Starfleet Academy says, "Use your
tractors, dammit!"  And yes, DD damage breaks WTYH - but DoT damage doesn't.
