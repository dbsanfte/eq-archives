   Oh... Ok, I guess I won't be needing this out then.  *zip*

   As for the question, this is just the sort of thing that intrigues and
discourages me about EQ.  You can be extremely skilled at playing every
class in the game, but even so, unless you are well geared, at some point
some of your characters are just going to be perceived as being sub par. 
Ya, it does sound annoying and you have my sympathies.  People do get
locked into cookie cutter thinking, in this instance thinking that only
warriors with x hps and x ac can be useful in any situation.  I guess its
sorta the same as the thinking goes for people who are afraid to leave the
POK at any time without Temp/Aego and KEI on.
