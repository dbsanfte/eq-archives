This is a massive misstatement.  In fact, ONLY the cheapest horse is worth the money, if what
you are after is the meditation and sitting bonuses.  If, like I do, you have arranged to
remove all the crappy movement restrictions and so forth attendant to the horse, then the very
slowest horse has exactly as much effect on movement as the very fastest... which is to say,
none at all.

Two concepts glued together for no reason.  The not sitting thing is Massively important for
healers and pure casters, less so for hybrids.

Running from a fight... well it is true that you can run slightly easier because you aren't
sitting, so you dont' have to stand first.  And you never do that stupid dance where you hit
the stand button just as the mob hits you and makes you stand... so you sit.  And repeat and
repeat until you realize that the only plan is to just get hit again and run, without mashing
the tricky stand/sit button again.

If and only if you insist on keeping the horse movement rate.  For me, all horses are the same
speed... but run 3 is almost always plenty fast enough to flee with anyway.

That would be sweet for a weakling who's willing to sacrifice ease of play for a horse model.

Better, they can be purchased at level one... try buying TBoots or completing a JBoots MQ at
level one!

Well that would be another mark in favor of a  horse... too bad it doesn't work with the model
off.

This one DOES apply with eliminated model.. because you only change what you see, not what
others see.

Turn the horse off and almost all the annoying parts vanish.

Horses can be clicked off instantly, so a fast horse with model on could be quite useful for
pulling and movement, without interfering with melee.  Of course thats 3 seconds before you
can beat a hasty retreat... but thats what SOW or Run 3 are for.

You don't get mana back faster if you are actively meleeing, only if standing still without
the attack button on.  Funny thing is this DOES include time spend casting or clicking items.
While hybrids would benefit more from a horse than pure melee, they won't see nearly as much
benefit as the casting classes will.

Who benefits the most?  Arguably clerics, who often spend more time than anyone standing
still, either casting (Cheal alone is more than 3 ticks long) or waiting to cast, or just
standing there after having cast because their healing spells build so much aggro that sitting
will pull the mobs off the designated targets and onto them.

Anyone with a good clicky item, though, benefits even more, because they can literally stand
there clicking any time they aren't actively casting a spell... and both while clicking and
while casting, they are getting mana back as if they were sitting to meditate.

Funny thing about bard kiting.  The reason you say horses are kite unfriendly is that they
start and stop with a delay.  Yes, thats annoying.. but bards never stop while kiting!  Run
run run in circles while you stack chant one two three four repeat...  as long as you are
faster than the mob so it doesn't catch you, thats all you need.  Before level 49, selos is a
massive pain to maintain, taking one of your song slots away, so cutting your power by a
quarter or a third.  Even post 49, you still have to keep selos memmed so you can refresh
every couple minutes.

A horse thats faster than mobs would mean no more selos, no more killing 1/8th of your song
list, no more worries... bards might be one of the best customers for a horse.... and that 150
safe fall?  What a bonus, bard safe fall caps out so low that running at selo's speed can be
deadly, with a good drum!
