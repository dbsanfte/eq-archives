Hehe, i got a theory that most of their tech support staff are actually 
trained monkeys, they whack away at the keyboard, and sometimes it solve 
something :)

Just look at this one, been trying to get my Skyshrine key back ever 
since they cleared the keyrings:

Went to SS after getting the reply, and tested. I sure as hell still 
cant zome from SS to CS without a key.
I know that i can kill the dragon and get key back in around 2 min with 
very small faction hit, but for me its a matter of principle, i want my 
key back, since 2 guides told me its a valid request, and not giving up 
before i get it. Waiting for reply from them again now.
