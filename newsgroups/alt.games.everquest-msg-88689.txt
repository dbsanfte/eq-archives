Getting a friendly enchanter to cast Intellectual Superiority or similar on 
you before you start practising evocation may help. It is supposed to be an 
anti-fizzle buff, and my testing it out on a poor familiar-summoning wizard 
seems to bear this out.

And practice with the new level 15 evocation spell rathet than Spirit 
Strike.
