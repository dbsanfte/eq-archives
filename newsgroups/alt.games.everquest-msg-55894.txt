All the servers are too old to worry about which is the newest non-split
(besides the FV server, which I wouldn't recommend due to its added
complexities).

I hear some people say that the SKs are the 4th easiest soloing class
(behind necros, druids and magicians).

If you create a dark elf, troll or ogre SK I recommend you go immediately to
www.eqatlas.com and print up your home maps...you're going to need them. :)
