Well  to RP you don't have to necessarily HATE good races if you're a member
of an evil race. That's not roleplaying becaue it is restrictive. I have a
16 Ogre Warrior named Shmash, an' hims jus' a big Ogra who wanna make hims
some friends and make tings go dead.

He's a big friendly oaf who doesn't understand why the human guards keep
wanting to 'hit hims in da head an' make Shmash fall down.'

Roleplaying doesn't mean following the EQ predefined crap. EQ has the most
crappy lore I have ever seen. None of the game follows along with it at all.
It does hinder roleplaying. If you are given common tongue to start off
with, then roleplay with it, ya know? Add your own flavor to things, don't
go with the pre-set crap that some developer think you should work.

THAT is true roleplaying.
