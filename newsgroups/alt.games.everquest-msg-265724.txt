Well yeah but what kind of "open beta" is it, really? Anyone who wants to 
try it?

Yeah, there are some risks to being 2nd. Their willingness to take that risk 
is a sign of confidence and strength imo.

I loved the graphic style, it was gorgeous and very satisfying in a very 
different way than EQ2's.

Yep, ran like a top on all machines here.

I'm more concerned about the utility and economic viability of the 
tradeskill system. From what I understand, crafting is a pretty low priority 
for Blizzard and as a result, player crafted items don't look like they're 
going to be very competitive with quest and mob drops. So, being a crafter 
sounds like it will be a fun and expensive hobby, not the strategic business 
that's provided by a truly competitive crafting environment.

Pally talents are not in yet? I remember playing a Warrior in the first 
stress test and it was drop dead boring, but everyone told me it was because 
I had no talents yet. So I changed to a human Mage and had a lot more fun, 
even without exeriencing the talent system. I would have played my Tauren 
Shaman a little more but the guy was so fugly I couldn't stand being him 
lol. I've roleplayed a lot of different things in my gaming career, but 
fugly is still hard.
