good luck on getting 3 drops from yelinak/tormax, and getting high amiable
faction with yelinak after killing him.
also, your arms still suck in the 2nd profile.  get hardened grey flesh
sleeves.
your bracer should probably be the 15 stam one, not the agi / dex
entwood mace SUXk it is slow, but if that's all you can get then it is still
good.  I use a Silverfang club, 10/17 75hps

are you human or iksar?
also, i'm not a fan of the gantru charm. get something with hps..then again
if you aren'ta pulling monk who cares i guess
necklace of superiority really sucks as well. anything is better than that.
again, get something with hps.
vah`dyn drops a 3ac 100 hp neck, heh.  but i guess its neat on resists, the
NoS.

oh well good luck with your monk....
