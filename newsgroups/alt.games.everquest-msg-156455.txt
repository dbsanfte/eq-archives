Nonsense, the issue isn't melee, its character capability.  Compare
warrior spell casting capability to paladin spell casting capability,
and you get a far more lopsided balance than the difference between
warrior melee and paladin melee ever dreamed of being.

The question is, does the warrior melee advantage outweigh the
paladin spell casting advantage?  Instead of wondering why there
is no balance, you should be wondering if its even close to
lopsided enough!

However, there is one melee situation where you outshine a warrior;
uncontrolled mob in camp.  Warrior dies or gets charmed or goes
LD, or an unmezable add shows up or anything along those lines,
I don't want a second warrior trying to grab it, people are going to
die while we wait for him to try and get its attention.  Paladin (or SK)
has the best chance of getting its attention FAST and then living while
the heals start coming.  Of course to do so the paladin uses spells
in addition to melee, so you may not see this as a "purely melee" issue.

Ah, but ranger spells compared to paladin spells suck eggs.  Monk
spells compared to paladin spells suck vacuum.  You also
sponge better than those classes... hopefully anyway since the monk
nerf.
