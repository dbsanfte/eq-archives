I don't know whether it's related, but there have been a ton of problems
with Global Connect as documented on the Ubisoft EQ forums:

I had a problem a few weeks ago where my account was set to provisional
expired, even though the payment details were valid. The Ubisoft version of
EQ redirects you to:

https://store.station.sony.com/subscriptions/subscription.jsp?gc=EQ

when you try and edit billing info. The problem was that there were no
buttons on that page, so I couldn't resubsribe or change my payment details.

The solution was to pester tech support and get the account set to closed,
whereupon payment details could be re-entered. There was an additional
problem in that any attempt to pay in anything but dollars would result in a
"The Station Store is undergoing difficulties" message, but that has
apparently now been fixed. I got my account working (after a week), by
subscribing with a CC and paying in dollars.

It was a real shambles, and has left a bitter taste for many....
