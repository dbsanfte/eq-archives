It was a rigged contest. Common practice in chess is to study your
opponent's previous games and base your strategy on their weaknesses. IBM
refused access to any of Deep Blues games while they had access to virtually
every competitive game Kasparov had played. He had to play cold turkey which
would never happen in anything other then a goofy exhibition like this.
