This has been mentioned many times before, but, in order to raise some 
cash, sell spiderling silks, spider silks, wolf/bear/cat pelts (low 
quality and up) in the bazaar.  They each sell for a few pp apiece, and 
you can start farming them at level 1, and get xp while doing so.

I started at level 1 with no money just like most everyone else, and I 
did not have the bazaar as an option at the time, so I wore tattered 
armor for quite a few levels.  There were no newbie armor quests at that 
time, so I didn't even have that option.  I used a club I looted off a 
skeleton I killed, I used pelts I looted and patterns I bought to make 
myself armor.

There is stuff for sale in the bazaar for 10pp that I dreamed of owning 
one day when I was a newbie.  Heck, there are things for sale in the 
bazaar for 10pp that I never even dreamed could exist at the time, the 
stats are so uber on them compared to what used to be available.
