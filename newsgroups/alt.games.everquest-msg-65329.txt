I'd agree with you (normally I like Intel but the P4 is a step backwards for
90% of us) but the XP is much cooler than the none XP Athlons, Good heat
sink and fans are necessary but a good case with a couple of fans and a good
cpu fan is enough.  This shouldn't scare anyone away like the Tbirds did.
An AMD approved power supply is also important.  I'd stick with GeForce.
While others are approved, it looks like (just an assumption) that the team
has adopted GeForce as the substitute for 3dfx as the standard bearer of EQ.
If it's a general gaming machine, the Radeon could be better.
