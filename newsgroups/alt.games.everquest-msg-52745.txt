    I've found that if someone goes LD with an item in a trade window, the
item drops to the ground when they log back in. Back when the Diamondine
Earring was something worth having I saved a buddy from losing the one he'd
just won, and was showing off when he went LD. Yeah, I watch the ground for
spare change in RL, too.
