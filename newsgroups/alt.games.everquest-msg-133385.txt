It ai so! RedSniper was my first illegitimate daug... son... err...
"thing", so it inherits the throne for the time being. I smell
revolution in the air... or perhaps [starts to crack up] a lingering
fart. BWAHAHAHA! FART JOKE! God, that's classic! I do believe so, yes.
That'll go down in the books for sure. That was fuckin' awesome.
BALLS!!! AHAHAHA! I yelled the word "balls" really loud. I am the
master! Etc. Etc. (are you still reading this bologne? if the answer
is yes, good for you. if the answer is no, then you have far too much
patience. [what??? that's backwa... UGH <a poison dart strikes neck
and man falls over dead>])

I'm glad God@hotmail.com frequents this newsgroup (alt.music.tool) or
else he probably wouldn't have allowed me to give him that BJ for a
chance to reply from heaven to your post. I'm glad he and I have a
common hatred for religions. Not that I hate religions or anything.
Seriously. Do. Not. But I do. Not. But I... Etc. Etc.

(Nothing personal, RedSniper. I haven't read any of your posts and
don't know who you are so I'm just talking shit for the sake of it.
Please excuse me. No harm done.)

Boy, writing that much crap in the span of about two minutes has made
me awfully tired. I'm spent.
