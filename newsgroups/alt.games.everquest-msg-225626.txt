Oh man, those were the days. :) I used to fence goods for a few people. I
didn't exactly enjoy being an auction freak, but my husband and I kept
changing our minds about our characters, so we'd have to sell our old
equipment and get new stuff.  I eventually got a reputation as a very fair
trader, which I was proud of.  Because I have a little sense in my head, I
was unintentionally doing "buy low/sell high" and after a character swap
we'd always have 1-2k extra. Met a lot of nice people.

Ok, it was frustrating as hell at times, and when the bazaar first came
out I was thrilled about it...but now I'll admit I miss sitting around in
EC or Faymart, people watching and spamming auction channel. :)
