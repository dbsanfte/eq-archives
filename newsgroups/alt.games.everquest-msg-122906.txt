Too bad they were being jerks about the geos, most folks seem to be willing
to find another camp, but I do seem to encounter a few assholes like that
now and then. I mean seriously, they could make more $$ camping Giants in FM
than the damn geos.

Now if they needed a dropped item for a quest, then usually simply asking
the campers to shout if it drops (assuming of  you are not there for that
reason), it certainly the polite thing to do.

Sadly enough, in both EQ and RL, it's the assholes that ruin it for the rest
of the good people and players.

Good Luck, and Good Hunting!
