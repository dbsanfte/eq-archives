    We do, when everyone's contribution makes a difference.

    Healer #5 is critical - take him away and we lose. That makes him a hero
to the raid, but because he's not the only person which we can say that
about he's no more important than the team.

    Tell me which fights you're talking about and I'll tell you how to run
the fight so you don't waste caster DPS. :-)

    Been tried. The boss's DPS was nerfed down so players had a chance.

> teleporting players/healers (range issues)

    Been tried. Because of range dependency of mob aggro, which is crucial
for a number of reasons and not something you can just throw away, MT being
teleported = MT no longer tanking. It's just a tank switch then. Teleporting
healers hasn't been done, but the effects are the same as flinging healers.
Again, the DPS of AE GFlux mobs is relatively low, and has consistently been
lowered after discovery, so players can heal against them.

> stunning dots

    The only "stunning DoT" out there is a fear spell. This, too, has been
tried. The only mobs with AE Fear also have either safe spots where healers
set up or low DPS, same reason as above.

> heal mitigation curses...

    That was done on one mob, wish I could recall the name, somewhere in
Luclin. Meemers, you remember the Luclin mob with the healing mitigation
curse? Again, as I recall the mob's DPS is nothing to fear.

    Which have likely been tried, and modified to suit EQ as it is today
because they don't work otherwise.

    You're equating "random" with "difficult", when they aren't nearly the
same. There's plenty of very predictable encounters in EQ that are
difficult, and many easy random encounters. A difficult random encounter
wouldn't fly, because two guilds doing the exact same thing can have vastly
different success rates (if it's truly random). That is unacceptable to the
player base, especially so in a game where competing to be the first to
complete content is considered so important.

    And my point is you are wrong about that. I can tell you every last
detail about an encounter, and you still won't know how to beat it. There's
still effort involved, there's still trials to see if you can execute a
given strategy or if you've overlooked some fundamental fact which you knew
but ignored, there's more to it than "tell me the facts and I'm done". It
depends on the mob how much more there is to the encounter, but you can't
brush this fact under the carpet.

    A developer must assume best-case results when deciding how quickly a
guild could progress through content, to prevent the "lucky" guild from
progressing too quickly. A random encounter with meaningful randomness to it
will almost never allow a victory in optimal time. An "unlucky" guild will
be stuck in one place, spinning their wheels, watching other guilds who
execute the exact same strategy pass them.

    Define a measure for this that isn't data-intensive to the point of
stupidity, and which cannot be exploited. It's not as easy as you might
think.

    No, I'm being a realist. Every encounter you propose would have to be
tested to see how quickly players learn to beat it, to see if it's beatable,
and to see that the script is bug-free. Every random element you place in
the script has to have all possible outcomes tested for this to happen. If
they're having difficulty testing now (for a number of reasons, one of them
being player apathy) then imagine the difficulty in testing a multi-branched
script until all possible bugs and outcomes are considered tested.

    To you, perhaps. I'd argue that it's as good as it's going to get with
the developing constraints they have placed on them. You could argue the
constraints, you can't argue the outcome.

    I considered them a crude attempt to smear by association. "Synchro
swimming sux, so does raiding, hur hur!"

    Not even remotely. Do synchro swimmers have differing conditions in
different pools such that it radically changes their approach to a program?
No, they don't - raiders do. Do synchro swimmers have a goal to meet that is
independent of someone's subjective decision of the merit of their program?
No, they don't - raiders do. Do synchro swimmers have preset elements that
must be present in their programs, influencing the direction they take? Yes,
they do - raiders do not. The two are in no way related beyond being
activities that groups of people participate in.
