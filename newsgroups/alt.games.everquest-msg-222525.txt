Now - Alla's shows only 1 bard useable, unlimited charge r-click invis item 

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12951

Argueably not attainable to the Chimp and the gimp operating by themselves.

Keep in mind that any type of invis will break the charm.  Earthen boots
are a mage r-click invis to animals that we used to get to have an insta
pet-be-gone that worked regardless of how far away the pet was.

Now that you don't need them for that, I'm considering getting them back
as a way to break charm when I'm in BoT.

So, widening our search to invis vs. animals

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10399
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=1653

And invis to undead

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12416

Again a VT drop.

So, this appears to be the most accessible:

Reading the info on getting it to drop - you
might be better checking the bazaar for it.
