Always wait for the monk to ask for the heal, he knows what he is going to 
be doing, you don't.  He may stand up while you are casting, which could 
get you on the hate list, and bring the whole slew that the monk was 
attempting to split right down on you.  At the very least, let the monk 
know you are healing, but in general, wait for him to ask for it while he 
is pulling.
