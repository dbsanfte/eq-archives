Only POTS modems need to do the A/D conversion, and internal ones still use
serial ports, they are just onboard. Everything else: ISDN, cable, dsl, ATM, T1
et. al. are digital and thus the term "modem" is invalid, though conventionally
used. (Oh, wait, ISDN does still require modulation/demodulation doesn't it?)
While an internal modem (POTS) can be faster than an external, internal vs.
external with digital connections is largely irrelevant, as the connection from
the comptuer to the "modem" is 10MBPS, and no consumer-grade connection is that
fast (yet).

I am so glad I live in Canada, where adsl comes in 1MBPS and up. unfortunately,
i don't live close enough to a central office to use it, so I am stuck with a
mere 1MBPS cable connection, shared with only 1 other person who is not a big
bandwidth user.
