A friend and I are both at close to the same spot in 56 (three yellow
and
a bit in) and grouped together in Seb.  Because we'd both died shortly
beforehand, we had a really clear idea of exactly where our exp bars
were at start.  After an hour or so, she comments that exp is really
good.
Well, its decent, but not all -that- good I say, about 2/3rd of a blue.
No,
a blue and a half, she says!  Well, we shrug that off as somehow one
or the other of us having remembered our start points wrong.  An hour
later, though, I'm at less than a blue and a half (under 2/3rds a blue
along
from the last point we checked, and this time I"m -very- sure) and she's

at better than two and a half, again twice my advance rate.  We are
trying
to think what is going on, and I check my AA advance, which I set at
10%.  I've got a blue in there.  She has AA turned off... and that seems

to be the only difference between us.

I turn AA off, and we each put in another half a blue in the next half
hour
or so, before the group breaks up, with our rates firmly in synch.

10 percent difference in our advance rates should have been barely
percievable, instead I suffered 50% loss of exp with AA turned to
that level.

Looked at another way, I spent  more than a blue of regular level 56 exp

buying a blue of AA experience... but that exp is generally supposed to
sit at the rate of advance needed to go from 50 to 51.  One blue of 56
exp should have bought me TEN blue of AA!

Upshot of this is that AA is now firmly in the "off" position where it
is
likely going to stay until I am firmly into 60.
