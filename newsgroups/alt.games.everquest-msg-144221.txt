Ok, I see this sort of thing a lot -
I have 2 machines, 1.1 gig celerons, 256MB ram,
1 with a 64meg GF2 MX400 one with an older
32meg GF2 MX400.

I run 1280x1024, but /viewport 0 0 1280 770,
clip plane all the way out. (so 25% more viewable
area than 1024x768, my pre-newui res).

(I use a couple of mods to shrink the hotbuttons
and buffs, and have everything that's always open
below the 770 line, with the exception of the transparent
hits window, and my casting/breath/mob health
bars.)

I run quite smoothly in almost all zones with
the exception of Shar Vahl and the Bazaar (need
to pull in my clipping plane there).

In fact, I just built a machine just like this,
but with slower 5400rpm drive (free is a good price)
for my buddy (who has a much faster machine as his 
primary) to 2-box with.  The first time he ran it, 
his first response was "WTF-It just zoned faster than 
mine!" (first time in, so the textures weren't even 
cached).

The secret is deciding if framerate is worth giving
up the new models, and new textures.

For me it is, I hate the new models (with the exception
of the Vah Shir, the new lower poly count versions are
too skinny!) and the new textures gave an unacceptable
zone time hit when SoL first came out.

I zone quickly, my viewpoint pans smoothly, and I can
see huge vistas in outdoor zones.  I understand the
urge to have all the bells and whistles turned on, but
the graphics engine in EQ is just not up to it on even
the highest end of today's machines.  At least not in
many zones, particularly in raid situations.

(I have a 1024x768, viewport 0 0 1024 514 variant for
raid situations - I can't have two full chat boxes in
the bottom area,but that's the only thing I give up.)
