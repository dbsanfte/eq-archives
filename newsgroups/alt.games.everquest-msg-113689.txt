After all, I didn't sign up to play EverMooch and since quests seem to be
where the action is (or at least where the useful items are) I guess I'd
better start thinking about finding a few to do.

However, since the guards in Neriak don't like me all that much (at least
while my head isn't on a spike outside the Spires), I'm now a permanent
resident of Qeynos and its surrounds, and I wondered if any of you might be
able to suggest a likely place to start for a somewhat unpopular dark elf
rogue of level 8 going on 9...  What I'm really looking to obtain are things
like a good piercing weapon (backstab's coming up in a couple of levels),
and some decent armour (ideally lightweight - I'm a wimp).  Or money.
Money's always good.

That said, the few NPCs I've tried speaking to have all asked me to do
things like clear out Qeynos' sewage system (and there's some nasties down
there) - so if you were me, what would YOU do?
