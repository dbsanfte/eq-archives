Who controls what posts stay and what posts are deleted/removed/whatever it
is they do to them?  More specifically, I've noticed that about 1/3 the
posts I have made have simply disappeared within a day or so of sending
them.  Why does this happen?

If I say something truly off-topic, I think it could be removed to save
people the bother of reading it.  However, I've seen ridiculously long
threads featuring two people calling each other idiots, back and forth, over
and over again, and they are left intact. If that's not off-topic, I don't
know what is.

If I say something objectionable, it should definitely be removed.  Why,
then, does the hatemonger's post remain (see Cleansing of Europeans Has
Begun!)?  If that's not inappropriate, I don't know what is.

No common element, objectionable or otherwise, stands out to me in my
clipped posts.  Who's randomly slashing my rhetoric?

Now understand, I don't want his name, home address, or anything of the
sort. I'm not angry, I'm just curious.  If there's a real reason I'd like to
know what it is.
