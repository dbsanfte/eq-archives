You cannot heal, evac, buff, etc other blue players.. no matter how
much they beg.

Another reason for doing this is to group with a small band of buddies,
making a very exclusive club.

Yet another is to play an EQ game of "killer" where you and a friend both
make up red alts and stalk each other.  Never did see much of this but
the restrictions on PK even for Red PCs at low levels have just about
eliminated it entirely, since it was done primarly as a lark, when your real
server is down or you just have an hour to kill and don't want to get your
main embroiled in something.  Now you'd have to actually dig in for a few
hours to level up past the restriction (still six?  Or is it ten now?) before
you could go hunting.

If there was a way to turn PK back off I think you'd see a lot more
Red players, but instead people simply duel or go to an Arena area
to spar against each other.  Since you never gain exp, and can never
loot, in PvP combat on a blue server, even this isn't done much.  Worse,
the game does allow you to lose exp from certain aspects of PvP death,
so half the classes either have to voluntarily restrict their capabilities
or the "game" holds more severe consequences for some, still with no
hope of reward.  Oh, and then lets discuss resistances.  As a cleric there
is essentially no hope for me to PvP a decently equipped PC, since their
Magic Resistance is invariably so high that I can't land any spells at all.
I'd have to out melee them with only the assistance of my self buffs and
heals; the nukes, blinds, stuns, roots, and so forth that I can use to my
advantage versus NPCs are useless against any PC with any sense.
