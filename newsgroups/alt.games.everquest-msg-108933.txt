Most likely, yes.   It sounds like Celeano's guild is in much the same
position mine is in.   We are able to do HoT, but only with difficulty.
Unless we get everyone in the guild, (especially clerics, of which we're
somewhat short) and a number of invites, each fight is a challenge.   Double
pulls are dangerous, and triple pulls are a probable wipeout.  (no, we dont'
always have a monk available for pulling.)    Unless everyone is acting in the
best interests of the raid, people start dying.

We also do some joint raids with another guild that is roughly in the same
position that we are.   With the combined forces, we see a lot more of what
you are talking about...  pretty much nothing there that can do more than a
couple of scratches.

And as a side note... the guild only raids are quite a bit more fun.  It's
like being back in Hate / Fear so many months ago, before it became overkill
and nearly semi public... risk and challenge, but doable.  With nice rewards
for succeeding.  Whereas the other has been described as "Just stand up and
hit /assist, then wait until you're told to random."
