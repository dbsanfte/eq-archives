I believe that the vitality (double xp) bonus goes up a fixed amount for 
a fixed amount of time, whether online or offline.  While online, and 
xping, you use it up significantly faster than it regenerates.  That 
being said, I have never run out of vitality with the exception of one 
new character I had just made, and one time during a marathon tradeskill 
session.  I should add, the tradeskill and regular xp vitalities are 
tracked seperately.
