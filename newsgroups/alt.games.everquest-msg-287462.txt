well that's a fair point, but the EULA says my license is to use the
software in conjunction with their servers, and i'm not doing that, so
whether my idea counts as use or not would be up to legal minds, i
think

even if i am bound by the agreement and thus liable for disobeying it,
liability for breaking the agreement, per se, is nothing .... however
(see below)

...i meant more like, i haven't violated copyright law by breaking my
contract with sony

well yes, but not in an absolute sense, which is what i was getting at

for example, in the EULA,  sony disclaims all warrantys, which is a
violation of the uniform commercial code since they deal in software

this is where i wanted to get when i said "however" above ... this is
a good point

i can't think of any situation where you'd have to pay an online
subscription fee to use software offline, but they could say that


not really worried about that, but good point
