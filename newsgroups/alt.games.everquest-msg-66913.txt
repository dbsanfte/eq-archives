You don't say how slow it is at 256.

I can say that: GF2MX400(64), Athlon 1200, 512MB RAM it takes me on average
a little less than a minute to zone.  Some Antonica zones take as little as
30 seconds but most are a little more than a minute.
/camp desktop doesn't seem to be any faster or slower than my Piii-450
computer with a VD3 & 256MB RAM.
