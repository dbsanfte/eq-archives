In Medieval times, attacking during a wedding was not unheard of.  The
idiots should have figured something could likely be up, with such a big,
public event planned.  At the very least, their guild should have posted
their own guards.

In my estimation, you won the war by default.  The enemy team surrendered by
crying 'uncle' to the GM.

If you ever find yourself on Sullon Zek, please join the Good Team.  Things
haven't been the same for us since Fansy the Famous Bard left.  ;-)
