Well Ive not done this specific one but I have done the gnome ones for
clerics and there was at least one drop I had to kill about 100 of the
relevant critters to find it. Rare drops are rare and if the numbers go
against you its a problem...

Three things....commit major genocide on beetles, put out OOCs to the zone
saying you want the item for newbie quests [often helps], and finally
check every vendor in the area round the entrance to Qeynos, the weaver
guy just in the gate, the vendors in the monk guild etc...often if the
thing isnt no drop people will sell it to the vendors as junk cash...
