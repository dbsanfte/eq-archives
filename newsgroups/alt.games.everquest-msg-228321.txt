I really wish you could stop being a blockhead and start comprehending
the posts, Charles. I can lead the horse to water but he's going to
drown before he starts to drink.

I just did, Charles. Very clearly, as well.

The problem is you STILL don't understand that your situation is
pre-contrived to fail because you STILL won't admit that it takes a
*significant* change away from gamey gameplay aspects to pull it off.

There's no point in explaining something fifteen times to someone
*deliberately* not getting it.

Believe it or not, Charles, designing an mmorpg is not simply deciding
which elements from other mmorpgs you want to include. Everything
works together. If you want to hear my perfect mmorpg, it will take a
great deal more time and energy than I particularly want to spend,
especially if its for someone as dense as yourself.

Again, Charles, they totally depend on how the game is built in many
other facets. Your failure-guaranteed contrived situation becomes
irrelevant because it would never be permitted to occur in a properly
implemented game.

And btw, you are also lying that I didnt offer any practical
suggestions, since by mentioning there wouldn't have to be a leveling
based system, there would, by definition, be no "newbs getting ganked
in their newbie fields". But then, that kinda defeats your contrived
scenario, doesn't it? No wonder you are pretending it was never
said....

You still seem to be stumbling over the idea that the game itself
establishes that when its properly implemented in a way people want to
play.

Of course, in your predetermined to fail contrived situation, that
doesn't apply.

Um, its already been provided by at least two people. But if you want
it again - its killing people for no game purpose beyond the fact you
can. And to point out again, for worldly pvp to be properly
implemented, that simply would not be in the player's best interests
(poor risk vs reward) nor would it be easy to do.

Your contrived scenario utterly failed to take that into account,
which is why its so easily dismissed. 

>
>Not everyone's view of when PvP is "worth it" is the same

The game establishes that, by risk vs reward. UO did not have much
risk and offered huge reward. Bad implementation. DAoC had almost no
reward at all, and what it did have rewarded the wrong things. Bad
implementation.

Hypocrite.
