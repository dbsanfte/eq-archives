People choose not to take advantage of it because its unbalanced. 
Choosing a harder mission results in no greater (nor even different 
rewards) so what's the incentive?

If they put all the raid drops from a given expansion on every raid mob 
(and the players knew), how many guilds would bother going to Time? When 
there is nothing extra there. When they could gear up the same stuff 
doing Tier1 stuff? 

Would they complain bitterly about getting shafted or would they say 
"hey, we have lots of variety available, we're just choosing not to take 
advantage of it? Its our own fault... I mean sure we *could* learn the 
Rathe council... but they don't drop anything different. We could learn 
Quarm but its the same loot again... yeah... that's motivation.

Welcome to LDoN/DoN.

> Not to mention plenty of other places outside DoN to go as well.

We shouldn't have to choose suboptimal paths through the game in order 
to avoid monontony. A well designed game would would put different items 
in different places to reward people who went to each place. DoN rewards 
you the MOST for doing the 'easiest' mission over and over and over.

Because that's where the best upgrades are. Sure there are lots of us 
who get bored with it and do take a break to do other stuff, but we're 
punished for it in terms of slowing down and/or not getting gear 
upgrades at all the moment we step off the treadmill.

Raid progression leads you through and the best gear is at the end, 
after you unlock/key/flag everything etc... in DoN all the gear drops 
off the first mission you fight. Doing anything longer, more 
complicated, or harder is just self-inflicted punishment.

Which is ridiculous. The path to gear upgrades -SHOULD- be on the same 
path as having fun. Raiders who love to raid are rewarded with amazing 
gear from the encounters and progression. One-groupers on the other hand 
have to choose between monotony for (still substandard gear) and going 
around and having fun, but forgoing the upgrades.

Vanguard has a great maxim:

"The path of least resistance should be the most fun"

The idea is that the things players want to do (like get gear upgrades, 
get levels, learn skills, etc should be the most fun. Grinding the same 
DoN mission over and over and over is not the most fun... therefore it 
should NOT be the *best* way (ie the path of least resistance) to get 
gear upgrades... but in EQ: it is the best way, it is the path of least 
resistance. 

Bad game design; simple as that. SOE should fix it.

If each DoN mission had different rewards people would do all of them. 
If each DoN mission has the same rewards people will do the easiest or 
most convenient one.

Don't blame the playerbase for optimizing their playtime. Blame the game 
design for making such a stupid optimal path.
