There's no relationship between how much AC your char has (Defence Skill,
Agility and the Raw AC generated by armour) and the HP total (char level,
STA and Class)

As a rule of thumb, for tank classes, AC is king... try to avoid swapping AC
for anything else.

For low level chars(below 20) then things like Regen and big HP totals
(relatively) can make a difference... but you can get these things from
buffs cast by group mates.
At higher levels (45+) then resists get more important than HP... but still
not as important AC. By this time you should be looking to get total AC over
1000.

Higher level tanks come in 2 flavours. Main Assist(MA) or Primary Tank is
they guy whose job is to hold the critters attention and take as much of a
beating as necessary. For this you need as high an AC as you can get,
resists if the critter is a caster, and enough damage output to keep him
interested. If your healer is good, then you can often just ignore your own
HP levels and trust your healer to manage that for you.

Second Assist(SA) or Secondary Tank is a slightly harder job... your damage
output is your main job, but not TOO much damage or you'll draw the critter
away from MA before you're ready. You also have to be more aware of the area
around you, because you have to intercept any Adds or take over from MA if
he/she is getting beaten down too quickly. In a 6 person group, this role is
often taken by Monks, Rogues and Rangers (who generally act as Puller as
well) whose choice of high AC gear is often smaller than the 'Plate Class
Tanks' (Warr, Pally and SK), meaning they have to sometimes make tougher
choices between Raw AC and stats/hp/resists/effects.
