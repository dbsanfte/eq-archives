Congratz, hold out till you find a good guild, dont join the first one that
invites you. Unless of course its a decent guild that you enjoy playing
with.

> I am a 7th level Paladin from Freeport, how do I get a quest?

You can ask most NPCs and they will give you quests to go on for rewards.

> I have never received a quest who do I get it from?

It depends on who you ask, many NPCs give quests.

> Is there a way to get some decent armor all I can afford is cloth!

This will give you a quest and armor both, talk to one of your Guildmasters
and ask questions using the words in [ ] and you will be given what you need
to make your armor, minus a few easily found items by killing monsters right
outside the city.  As for more money, keep your Spiderling and Spider silks,
also keep any Low, Medium or High quality pelts from any anilmal, but not
ruined.  These can be sold in the Bazaar for platinum, once you have a
decent amount of these just ask a player in game how to get to the bazaar.

Incase you didnt know, to ask everyone in your current zone a question type
/ooc <msg>

Some common abbreviations you will see are:

WTB Want to buy
WTS Want to sell
PST please send tell, you do this by typing /tell <name> <msg>
LFG looking for group
LVL level
