You need to define your expectations a bit more.  (In)effective at WHAT?  It's
effective at making me try to avoid unnecessary deaths.  The shared nature of
it is effective at causing MASSIVE frustration when a pickup group member is
stupid.  It's effective at making me not want to log in for a few days if I
have lots of it.

I haven't noticed this.  Most people I've grouped with really try to avoid it,
and tend to stay until it's gone if a small amount accrues.  If a large amount
of debt is taken (say, a raid with multiple wipeouts), some just plow through,
some spend a few days doing tradeskills or not playing until it goes away.

People that I've met universally try to avoid it, and it seems quite effective
at punishing death.

You play differently than I.  I usually have no debt, and when I get some, it
works off pretty quickly.

Here, we're the same.  I guess I just don't die as much when doing it.  I'm
only L18, though, so it may get harder to avoid or make up debt as I advance.

I think they did intend this, and I agree it's something of a success.  For
different reasons than you do, but it's all good.  Personally, I'm glad death
has enough consequence to be something most try to avoid, it makes the
challenges more fun to overcome.  So far the balance of that against the
fun-killing frustration of xp loss (which this really is - it's loss of future
xp rather than past xp) is about right for me and my friends.

The big win, though, is in just enjoyment of adventuring.  This was true in
much of EQ1 as well - if you're just out to see things and have fun, rather
than grinding out in-game rewards, a little extra time to do so before the
next level is not much harm.  If you're only playing to advance the character
to uberness, any slowdown is a failure.
