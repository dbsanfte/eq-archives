Some names are funny, and in good taste ... my first character was an iksar
necro. I made a poor fantasy choice for a name at 20th and he was dubbed
Spektur Gadjet ... some people found it funny, others scowled at me worse
than the rivervale druid guild :)  I dont have him anymore, as I have
adopted a more fantasy type approach to the names.  I did see one about a
week ago, that almost made my wife quit playing the game ... on Bristlebane
was a high elf cleric named ... Abortions .. I was shocked that it even made
it through the day.  A week later, after I had done a /report and a
/petition, I see this guy STILL online and with the same name.  I sent a
direct /tell to a GM saying : "Pardon the /tell, but there is a character
here named Abortions, and my petition and report over it went untouched.
Could you please remove the name right now?" Now I wonder ... is the players
to be held responsible? Or should the lack-a-dasiy attitude of the gm not
respnding to these things in a quick manner?

Oh and BTW, I got a warnign for the direct tell ... unbelieveable.
