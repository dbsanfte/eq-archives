That is the whole fun of exploration. Only time I look at maps is if I need
to find a loc for something that I'm not already familiar with (or with a
zone like east wastes where it's impossible to find anything without using
/locs during a snowstorm).

Yea, trying to use spells based purely on in-game information would have me
pulling my hair out.

Well, I usually use /con for this ;)

I do extensively use internet resources for information on items and
quests. And I couldn't fathom trying a trade skill without checking out
information on it beforehand...information in-game is not only sparse, but
what little information DOES exist, is usually wrong.
