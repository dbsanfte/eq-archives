Similarly, I'm not necessarily talking about someone who 'actually' tried 
to kill themselves.  Sure, they took a lot of pills, but then -told- 
someone they had, or left evidence where it would easily be found...

It relates to the attention-seekingness of it all.  People do things they 
'thought would be funny' for much the same reason.  I agree that the 
comparison is something of a stretch.
