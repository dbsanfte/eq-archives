Some places this works well, some it dosn't.  In most PoP zones mobs tend to
reset fairly quickly.  In LDoN mobs can have a long memory, even after
returning to the spawn points, they won't always for get you.  Seb is
another place I have had mobs just not forget me.  I was fd and afk for 45
minutes once, and when I got back up a frog I had aggored before still came
after me.
