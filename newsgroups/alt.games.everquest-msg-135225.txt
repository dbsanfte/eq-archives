Went back and looked, there's about 6 different .PWL files on there, all
created within the last 24 hours. I don't think any of them got past

I hope none of them got past Zone Alarm. 

And since I've taken it off line and it will NOT be going back on line
until the hard disk is wiped and I'm sure it's going to stay wiped ...
Ain't none of them gonna' get past it now.
