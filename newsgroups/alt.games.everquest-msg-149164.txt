Work with me here, average cleric density one per 6 people, so regardless
of size of wipe, time for an efficient team to rez the wipe is only a bit
over 60 seconds (rez clerics first, who can instantly start rezing with
clicky...
and running YV while they do so for faster mana regen)

Its not the rezing, its the buffing that costs mana, and if you have a MGB
cleric to do it, even that doesn't cost much time, just a minute with a mage
to rod up to sufficient, bang it out, then rod back up to full.   Bottleneck
would be all the other buffing classes getting their stuff done.

You mean for necro/shadowknight?  Or do you mean the /corpse dragging
plan?  Cause the latter would be a handy thing indeed, multidragging
is a pain and going back several times instead is no better
