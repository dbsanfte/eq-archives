To fish in EQ2, you need to find water, then you need to find the various 
fish nodes.  You will be able to fish 2 or 3 times from each node, then it 
will vanish, and you will have to find another.  It is not generally hard 
to find them, most water areas seem to have them.  Look for things like 
"school of fish".  In some areas you may have to go into the water to get 
close enough, and possibly even swim down under the water to them.
