As a fellow Giantslayer, I say 'stick to your guns'. If they don't like 
the way you play, they don't deserve to have you.

Balls to that. SOE doesn't want anybody to do that. The game design (
when it works, which probably doesn't most of the time) calls for 
meaningful decisions. If you go with Dragon/Coldain faction, you'll miss 
out on nice NToV equipment. That doesn't mean you are expected to hose 
your Dragon faction at some point, it means that faction in Velious is 
supposed to be a meaningful decision, with consequences.

If it was down to me, I would make factions unrepairable, that if they 
go down by a certain amount, they can never go up again.

Cool. Things should get a lot more interesting for you now... :)
