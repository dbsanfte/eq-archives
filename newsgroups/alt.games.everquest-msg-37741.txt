Any time my 54 enchanter happens to come across pages 26L or R he buys them,
just waiting for a nice, pleasant level 14-17 enchanter to happen to show
up.

My enchanter's research skill is somewhere around 140 (give or take 5) and I
have no problem combining pages for folks who ask politely and bring the
book & pages for free.  They get a Clarity, too.

Enchanter research is NOWHERE NEAR as DAMNED annoying as ALL HELL as
magician research, but it's still a pain to have to use all that locker
space on research-only spells.
