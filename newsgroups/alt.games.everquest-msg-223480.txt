I totally agree with reading the pop up window, but you missed the part
where apparently, not everyone gets a pop up window.  They're just sent.  I
can't think of any other explanation for 20 characters popping into oblivion
at the exact same second I get the trans pop up box.  I doubt they're that
syncronized. ;)  If the pop up box was mandatory, this wouldn't even be an
issue IMO, other than one of a minor annoyance.

I haven't found the in-game toggle for it, though, so I could be wrong, but
I trust what I saw.  I feel bad for a low level or newer player who doesn't
know what a trans to bind is, let alone how to make sure your toggle is
on/off, and gets caught in one...  All of the sudden, their low/mid level
warrior is just gated to Frontier Mountains or Karanas, and they have (at
best) a 5-10 minute run back, or (at worst) a CR or two.
