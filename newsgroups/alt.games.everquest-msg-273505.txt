Are you talking about Torment?  With the silence casting birds up in a 
square area above the entry area?  Nightmare has nothing to get past, 
it's a wide open outdoor zone with lots of single pullable mobs.  The 
entry is the misshapen tub in the middle of the buildings north (I think 
it's north) of the building complex you zone into.  Torment is the one in 
the center of the zone in building complex.
