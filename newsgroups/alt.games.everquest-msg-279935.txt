with really conscientious / paranoid tanks this can happen
with mezzable mobs too - I know many tanks from the POP era,
before the warrior aggro buff, who liked to 'pre taunt' mezzed
mobs to ensure they had aggro before they broke mez.

Once they had aggro locked on the current target they'd leave
the DPS dps'ing and switch to the mezzed mobs to taunt aggro
off.

Shrug ;)
