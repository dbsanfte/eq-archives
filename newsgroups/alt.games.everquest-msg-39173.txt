I'll assume by this that you have a Human Bard.

Yes the mask still drops and usually rots.  When I got mine, I tok my level
1 rogue out of RV and hide/sneaked my way to Guk, bumming a SoW on the way
to increase my speed.  Nothing on the way to the Ass/Sup room saw past
hide/sneak.  When I got there, there was a group waiting for a respawn.  I
asked if I could loot any rotting masks, and they said yes.  So I sat in the
corner with Hide on, and waited for the pop.  Within 20 minutes, I had my
mask and made my way out.  With my Bard, I had a more difficult time.  I
took my bard to the Ass/Sup room and to my dismaythe room was uncamped.  So
while I still had Invis Undead, I camped in the room, and logged on my main.
I meticulously pulled each mob from the room and killed it.  I had to hold
the room for about  2 hours before a mask dropped.  My suggestion is to
stock up on a few IU potions, and make your way to Lower Guk.  before you
waste a potion, make sure that someone is in Ass/Sup and if so, ask if you
can loot a mask.  If they say yes, chug a potion and head to the room.  If
you are of a level that can join the group, do so.  Otherwise sit either in
a corner, or behind the ladder under the room to be safe.  Make sure you
keep IU on.  Also, the Ass/Sup group usually pulls the Gargs, which drop the
Basalt Carpace, which you need for the Lambent BP quest.  You may get lucky
and nab one of those also.  No need to pay anyone, since the masks rot an
awful lot.
