Que pasa? What are you talking about? Language is about conveying concepts
and emotions and relations. Some of these things are inappropriate in
some circumstances and some are rude.

As long as humans exist as something less than utopian selfless
perfectly saintly beings there will be concepts that are rude, and remain
rude or offensive when conveyed in language.
