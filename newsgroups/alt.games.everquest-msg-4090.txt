History: HE mage to lv60, DE mage to lv20, gnome mage to lv20, erudite
mage to lv12, human mage to lv16, and now (I like mages) back to
starting another HE mage and she just turned 30.  First, all had
enought int to start with as with a mage it's not the total mana pool
(int + mana items) you have but the rate at which you use it that
counts.  Unlike a wizard that can root and nuke forever, you fight
only as long as your pet does (solo anyway) so there is just so much
mana you will ever need.  It is possible to chain-cast pets but this
is a high risk strategy and in my experiece is not an efficient way to
level.  By lv50 all mages can easily have the max 200 int anyway.

Personal exp with different races; others may feel much different:

DE mage: can't train or buy spells at most guilds... also many vendors
wont sell too DE but they make great mages.
Gnome mage:  great for roleplaying and overall good stats but I just
didn't like being so short and not seeing as well what was going on.
Note: many feel the opposite about short races.
Erudite mage:  good mage and the extra int makes you feel better even
if not realy needed.  I quit as I just don't relate to this race as
well as others.
Human mage:  easy to start because of the excellent low lv zones near
Qeynos and Freeport and there are 2 very easy quests that will get you
2 gold stud earings (+3 int each) and a +3 int wrist band from the
Paladin in the pond in town.  I had these done by lv6 increasing my
int to 119 which proved to be more than enough for a newbie mage.  I
switched servers or would have continued to play this one.
High Elf mage:  only weakness is low strenght but that is now largely
fixed with our Level 8 100% weight-reducing summoned bags lasting for
30 min if you log or go LD.  The high charisma that HE have is also
nice as you buy cheap and sell for more and over the long run make a
big difference.

Bottom line, they are all good and in the end game equal in nearly
every respect so the choice is all yours.  Have fun.
