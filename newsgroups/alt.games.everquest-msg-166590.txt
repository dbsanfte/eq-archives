A number of sellers seem to think buyers enjoy the lag and cluster of
traders near a bank or end of stalls. It makes me wonder if sellers think
buyers browse all the traders and not use the /bazaar search and trader
locate functions..

If you want to dramatically increase sales and avoid crowding get as close
to the arena areas as you can. Many buyers pick a new trader from the list
to locate if the locate function points to a bank or cluster. In fact I have
sold more items for slightly higher prices simply due to location.
