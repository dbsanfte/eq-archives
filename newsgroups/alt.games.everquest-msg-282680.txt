Well, what can you say about SoE...  They go with whats worked for them in the
past.    This isn't the first time they told this one.   In original EQ, they
claimed for a year that the Firey Avenger quest was in the game.   People
wasted hours upon hours running around analyzing every worthless piece of
dialogue in the entire game.   Then SoE announced that (paraphrasing) 'since
nobody had even managed to find the start of the quest, they were going to
change the quest and make it easier.  But it really, really was already in the
game.  Honest!'

I think all of two people believed them.
