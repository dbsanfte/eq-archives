Okay, here's the longest shot I've seen.  But what if its only remapping
the keyboards of people who have a function for Q?
I think Q starts off w/o anything attached to it.  What if they only meant
to
change it if you didn't already have it mapped, but got the logic wrong and
now it only moves it if you have Q mapped to something else?
I mapped Q to my first spell gem, and when I logged it I kept auto attacking
because it was changed to Q.
