They seems to have vanished sometime a month ago. I was looking for
one to start 3 boxing myself as getting group on my server during my
time is rather hard nowday.  Walmart didn't have any, Target didn't
have any, Best Buy didn't have any, CompUSA didn't have any.  

Just about every places that carried Platinum set before don't have
them now and most of them don't even have an empty shelf space, they
reassigned them to different games suggesting they may not be carrying
it anymore.  Some of the stores aren't carrying DoN or OoW anymore
either leaving just DoD and EQII on the shelves.

But to be out of stock on just about every online places including
Sony seems a bit odd.  Then again when was the last time you saw a
Gold edition set anywhere other than eBay or second hand shops?

I would think with OoW, DoN, and DoD the nearly 2 years old Platinum
edition is a bit outdated.  Maybe SoE is planning to release an
updated package with OoW and possibly DoN included.  Titanium edition?

It's a shame I already have a new DoN and OoW sitting around gathering
dust waiting for a Platinum set to go with them.
