I have played a character up to level 14- a Shaman on Brell Serilis.  
I've done pretty good on my own- but now I need help.

1) how do I get into a guild-  I see so many running around and I know
they are important- but it seems rude to walk up to a stranger and say
"hey- let me join you"

So my question is how did you start with your guild- is there a polite
way to introduce yourself.

2) I'm trying to start in the bazaar- I've got myself all set up.  My
question is do I need to buy food/drink for my trader so they don't
die- or is that not a factor.

Also- does the trader only stay there when you are logged in.

Thank you in advance for any help
