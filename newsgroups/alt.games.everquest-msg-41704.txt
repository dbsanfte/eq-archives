Apart from Hussein and Iraq -  at this stage.  Sure, I don't think WWIII
will start in the next couple of weeks, but I do not rule out the
possibility that it could help fuel it.  It may take a few years, but what
if the wrong people start getting into power in those countries (terrorists
take over - not such a unbelievable concept).  Arafat with all respect
doesn't have much longer one would think in just one case.  Furthermore,
neither Russia nor China would be stupid enough to start a war witht he US,
but who is to say they don't join one?  Both countries hate the US, as do
most Arab countries, the slavic countries, quite a few African countries
etc, Indonesia also comes to mind.  In fact, Indonesia absolutely detests
Australia, and if Australia put in a resolve with the US (and they have
indicated they will), if could be the chance Indonesia is waiting for.

As I said, I don't think getting all caught up in war is the go, but neither
should we be complacent and just settle back into the old routine.  Tuesday
showed us that things are not the same anymore.
