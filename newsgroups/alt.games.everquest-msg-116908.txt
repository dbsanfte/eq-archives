  Are you soloing or grouping?  Soloing is hugely boring, but grouping and
doing dungeons, in my experience, is a lot more fun.  Boring outdoor zones
are just that... and I think a lot of druids kind of get into the habit of
hunting in boring outdoor zones.  I got really bored with my druid at level
42 and my login experience went pretty much the same way... I'd log in, kill
a few things, get bored and leave.  Most of my friends hunted in the same
areas I'd be soloing, so there wasn't a whole lot more excitement there.

  Maybe you're like me and druids just aren't the class for you. ;)  I never
really enjoyed the 'caster lifestyle' that much, where you sit around
meditating, only to stand up and buff/heal/nuke/root/snare (or you're
soloing, which is even more boring in most places where soloing is
practical).  I love being a shadow knight because I get to be right in the
thick of the action, and often I'm the one who does the pulling, which does
present a unique challenge depending on the area you're fighting in.  Also,
I kind of burned out on my druid because I never felt like I had anything to
shoot for.  Druids (pre-Velious/Luclin, at least), kind of got the shaft
equipment-wise... I think their only class specific armor was planar, which
was a disappointment.  To an extent this has been fixed now, but as a melee
class you'll almost always find you have something to shoot for, whether
it's a piece of armor with high AC, or something with a good rightclick
effect, or a Haste item, or a new weapon.  With my druid character, though I
spent a lot of time camping items to upgrade my gear, I never really felt
after the upgrade that I really had improved my character in any significant
or measurable way.  The opposite is true with my knight.

  So maybe stick with your level 10 knight... get him to 35 or so and see if
you appreciate the role you're playing with that character moreso than your
druid's role.  At very least you it will give you a little variety.  When
you get sick of one set of challenges and duties, you can switch to another.

  BTW, I apologize for all my "druid bashing" lately.  I realize they don't
"suck", but I really do think that there's something about playing a druid
that is ultimately unsatisfying, at least for some players.  Despite the
convenience of SoWs, teleports, and the ability to solo decently, I don't
think I could ever go back to playing my druid, even if I found I had people
begging for me to join their groups.
