As far as I could find out, the higher level berserker abilities, snare 
stun and jolt, looked identical to each other, more or less, but used 
higher level axes which in turn use higher level components, which cost 
more: a stack of components for the first series cost around 1pp, a 
stack for the second series cost 13pp.

Experimenting around, though, I found this: The range of the underlying 
axe used for the first tier abilities is 125, the range of the one for 
the second tier is 150.

Out of range from the target, I stepped forward, stopped, tried the 
first tier snare and then the second tier one, repeated a few times, and 
found a spot where the second tier one would land but the first tier one 
would not.  Repeated the experiment a few times, and decided it was 
conclusive:

The second tier snare has a longer range than the first tier snare.

Is that exciting?  Well no, not too much, the increase in range is only 
20%.  But at least its something.

After playing with this a while, I stopped using the higher tier snare 
to pull with, because its a nuisance, meaning that I have to carry three 
axe types, one for the first tier so I can stun and perhaps jolt, a 
second for the second tier snare, and a third because it has the highest 
damage ratio, and there are circumstances where I end up using throwing 
to do damage (I've got the mob down to 10% hp but I'm also down that low 
and have been forced to snare and throw kite)

What I'm doing now is keeping a partial stack of the second tier axe on 
me so that when (as sometimes happens) I run out of first tier axes, I 
have a backup way to snare a runner.  After that fight is over, I make 
sure to replace the first tier axe stacks, and kick myself for letting 
myself run out in the first place.  Its like carrying a spare can of gas 
in your car for emergencies.

OH, another discovery: I can load two types of axe in my inventory slots 
for range and ammo (putting the ability component axe in range).  Doing 
this, when I use ranged attack I eat the axes from the ammo slot, and 
using my abilities uses axes from the range slot if there are none left 
in inventory (oddly, it uses inventoried axes first).  This means I can 
readily tell when my component axe supply is running low by looking at 
my range slot, and indeed can tell if I've run dry by looking at my 
range attack button.
