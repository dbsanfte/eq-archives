Hmmm, maybe, but if he's root/snared, it's not like you can't get away from
him and med for a little bit before he summons again.

Oh, the salamander (I have NO idea why people THAT HAS SEEN THIS BUGGER
still call him a dragon).  Level 60 warrior, 2 clerics assigned to him plus
4 druid/shaman, oh, another 8 or 10 level 50+ tanks with 8-10 healers.  Plus
the support people; enchanter, necros, bards.  Thirty level 50+ should be
able to do him if they've worked together before.  It's dangerous to get
cocky if you're only 50+.  All it takes is one caster sitting down at the
start of the fight to TPW.

Two 58+ groups should be able to do it assuming the 60 warrior as main tank.
