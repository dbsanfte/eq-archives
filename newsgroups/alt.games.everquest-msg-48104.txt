there we disagree. What I dislike most about the
nerfing is that this is a quest that has been
around pretty much since the beginning. It is
worthwhile only for non-bards from levels 1-3.
More to the point though, it gives experience
without killing snakes, bats and rats. I loathe
levels 1-5 with a passion.
