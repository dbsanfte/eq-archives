I zoned to dunlak and there were bodies everywhere; i camoed and wandered up
and down, trying to figure out what happened. I checked afterwards, and the
npc's seemed indifferent (very tough tho).

I take it the npc's don't help if you are being attacked? Or do they attack
for some stupid, unpredictable reason? (eg the way halflings do if you walk
near mangler). Do mobs get trained to the docks a lot?

If anyone has any guide to this zone, can they tell me about it? I tried
asking around but the people there seemed preoccupied with corpse runs.
There was even a spirit binder with a corpse next to it; does this place
have nasty death loops?
