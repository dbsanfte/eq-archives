Has this always been like this? I know killing a lvl 1 snake or a lvl 1
skeleton give wild differences in exp. Animals always seem to give more exp,
but less loot. (Sorry for the odd example, but I recently started a Troll
Shaman and after a few kills I only went for the animals to get exp faster).

Maybe it's some method including monsters' HP and possibly loot tables. It
would make a lot more sense.

ps. Consider OT for exp instead of any other zone with the same Zmodifier
and level of mobs. The exp of Rhino's and Tigers is mad compared to the
rest, but they hit a LOT harder and seem to have more hp. yet the level is
the same as other, less hard,  things.
