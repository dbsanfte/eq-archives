Well, at least in Butcherblock, the dwarf on the end of the docks is on
a different faction than the guards and such. My troll has always been
KOS to the dorfs, but not that female dwarf on the dock. So I imagine
you could TL over and then jump off and swim around.

Freeport... hrmm... there's that fishing girl there, so it could be a
problem for very low level players.

I believe the Erudin docks are clear. Erud's crossing should be fine
unless you've been killing Kerrans. Don't remember about Qeynos. Ocean
of Tears has a named Sister of Errolisi out on the dock who could give a
lot of players trouble.

There *is* the benefit of still apparently being non-KOS for a couple
seconds after zoning, so you could just hit the ground running, but I'd
hate to rely on it.
