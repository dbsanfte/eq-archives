I'm trying to get EQ going again but can't get past
the char select screen. I can select a char but I never
get on to a server it just pauses for a few minutes then
displays a screen saying "you have been disconnected"
The only thing different in my PC is a new hard drive.
This did involve a clean install of Win2k but EQ ran fine
under the same OS on my old drive.

What I've done so far:

Format and install OS
Install newest Via 4in1 drivers for MB
Install AMD LargePageMinium patch
Install v12.90 drivers for GeForce3
Install DX 8.0a
Install Rok/SoV and get all the patches

Any ideas on what I'm missing here to get
EQ working again?
