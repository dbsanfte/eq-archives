Damn, 25kpp a pop? It's been ten years since I last got paid for drawing, 
but that's surely an incentive to see if I've still got it. :)

Actually, not to diss the guy, but there seems to be more Photoshop 
pixel-bothering of screenshots than actual drawing there. I think I 
agree with Winterfury's post... don't part with your plat until you have 
had a go at it yourself.
