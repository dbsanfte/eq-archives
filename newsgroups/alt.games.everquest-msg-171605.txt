While delivering Muffins to a Dwarf in the Hogcallers Inn in West Freeport,
I encounted a small halfling girl who spoke something about mail to room 2.
She appeared to drop a key to room 2. I picked up the key and spoke to
her....unfortunately I hit auto attack and a fight began.

I was unsure what to do, but eventually i killed her, though i was frozen to
the ground for a while.

as she died she muttered something about the halfling race avenging my death
or the Freeport Militia would hunt me down...

I examined her but didnt loot the halfling head. i then camped.

Does this mean that halflings amd Freeport Militia will kill me as look at
me?
or does it just mean a lowering of faction with such groups?

I am a LVL10 paladin halfling myself, only character.

Which brings me to more questions regarding Faction etc.

Can a player actually see "faction stats"?

What is the best way to increase levels......doing the quests, killing all
MOBs, or a mixture of both???

Thanks for any help.
