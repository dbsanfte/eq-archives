Depending on how many channels you have joined, in numerical order by when
you joined them, /# will talk to that channel.

If the global auction channel is your channel #1, then /1 will send a
message to the global auction channel.

;help will list all the commands you can use with global channels, most of
which require a ; (semicolon) rather than / before the command.
