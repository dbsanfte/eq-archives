    I know. Someday, when all the raids are done. Hey, I did XP in Chardok
for the first time just last weekend! I'm getting better! (I'd only been
there three times before, every time on a Royals raid.) I'll never be part
of the official Chardok Pharm Team, though - our group of non-KOS people who
go through the entire place at the end of the day and cherry-pick every
named up.

    I know the drops. They would improve my alts, and I still have on a NoS
myself. It's actually one of the things we have to be really careful of on
raids - when non-oooober gear drops that is droppable, you need to look
around and see what everyone is wearing. Nothing more embarassing than
saying "LOL, my level 22 twink could use that!" followed by one of the mains
in the guild mentioning how that's always been a hole in his gear and could
he get it, please.
