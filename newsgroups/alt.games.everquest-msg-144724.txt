Was, not is.  It's been nerfed.   During the first few days of Luclin, the
register for trading quest would adjust you huge amounts with everyone.
After the first week or two though, it was nerfed to much smaller faction
hits.   I ran it about twice when it was good, and 30 or 40 (or more) times
since.  That got me to max ally with the merchants, and amiable to the rest
of town (Frodel, Midst and Stout).   Killing bandits in echo has gotten me
to kindly since then, but thats even slower than the faction quest, if thats
possible.
