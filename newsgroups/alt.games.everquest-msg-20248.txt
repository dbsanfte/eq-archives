I understand your point.  Understand, too, that there's a difference between
"big brother" goose-stepping all over your right to name your character
whatever you see fit, and behaving like an idiot.

Yes, I agree, this isn't a true RP game.  Let me tell you how I feel.  When
I see a character named Vacuum Cleaner I immediately judge them to be: an
idiot.  An idiot I don't want to group with, nor have in my guild, nor do
any favors for, nor take very seriously if they ask for help.  This idiot
did not use a single ounce of creative thought or maturity when naming their
character -- and made no effort to hide that fact.  They may as well have
named themselves Iam Anidiot.

The naming policy is clearly stated, and you agree to it every time you
play.  Yes, you are free to name yourself whatever moronic name you like,
but don't expect others to feel the same way you do, or rally to your cause
should higher powers decide your name needs to be changed.
