Howdy all,

  I'm trying to get my level 30 bard song from here.  I couldn't seem to
find an easy way to get there.  I also discovered you can't breathe in The
Grey and you die rather quickly.  Corpse run later tonight...
  My question is, what is the easiest way to get there for a level 34 Bard?
It seems like I have to cross a level 50+ area no matter which direction I
take.  Is there an easier way?

TIA for any advice/help.
Sean...
