Downloaded the patch this morning and some more this afternoon, finally 
got around to trying to log on a few minutes ago... and I'm not getting 
close to getting in.

I kep downloading mischiefplane.txt, then getting to the downloads 
complete and seeing the whole OOW patch message.

Hit play, I get my windows screen, the EQ box appears down on my taskbar 
for a second, then my screen sort of blinks for a split second, and I 
get a pop up box saying that EQgame.exe has encountered a problem and 
has to terminate, which it procedes to do.

Could be worse, could have decide to exterminate...

But anyway, I went in and deleted the eqgame.exe, repatched and 
downloaded it again, no dice.  Tried killing the mischiefplane.txt file, 
no joy.

No EQ for me today, which honestly is fine I'm too tired to do more that 
just take a peek.  But its frustrating.
