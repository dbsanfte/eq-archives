<snip for brevity>
It's terribly fun, addictive, and so worth it. Considering you don't have to
pay for new "versions" for bug fixes and such, it is quite economical.
Here are some sites I have found most helpful:
www.everquest.com
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/
www.eqvault.ign.com
www.eqatlas.com (excellent source for maps)

I would suggest the Bertox server, but I'm biased <grin>. Feel free to drop
me an email at dariya7@home.com if you have any questions. Between me and my
roommates we have several high-level characters and have been around the
block awhile.
Welcome and hope to see you around sometime.
