Can you elaborate?  I'm a druid, and just started jewelcraft today.
Not a cheap hobby; I'm down 300 pp on silver and stones but picked up
45 skill points in about an hour and a half.   As a Tunare follower, I
can imbue emeralds.  I know that's not exciting, but if I can find
friendly enchanters who will 'chant metals, I can make some nifty
items, too.
