1    Is there any kind of map feature so you can work out there you are?

2    I have a level 3 druid, can I use bind, and if so, how?

3    I seem to be wandering around Kelethin at the moment without any
purpose, I have talked to pretty much everyone and got a few very minor
quests. How do you get more substantial quests and know where to go for
them?

Many thanks in advance.
