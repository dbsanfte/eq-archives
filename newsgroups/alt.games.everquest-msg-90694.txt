No flaming on that one.

You goofed in-game (wedding or no wedding) and got blessed out about it.
You thought you were right, so you sounded off about it here.  Well, it's
still a goof.  If you're good enough to say to yourself, "Oops, I goofed
..." and stop training the docks, then that's one way you can help others
not act like a newb when you see them doing it.  If, otoh, you're going to
go "Oops, I goofed ... but it wasn't my fault, honest!", you might consider
asbestos undies.

This ng ~is~ a real wealth of knowledge.  I can't recall ever asking a
question here without getting a great response in a pretty short timeframe.

And btw ... thanks for bottom posting!  :-)  It makes the thread much easier
to follow.
