Sometimes there seems to be a real snobbery about getting the
"perfect" group for LDoN.

I was once in a group with me, level 30 odd bard, a high 20s shaman a
30 odd enchanter, a ranger, an SK and a warrior. The adventure type
was an assassination.

When we got to the dungeon it turned out that the shammy couldnt get
in. It seemed that for some reason LDoN hadnt installed properly.
Luckily he was sharing my broadband connection at the time, and was
able to copy my entire EQ folder across while the rest of us carried
on.

We did 80% of the adventure with just the 5 of us, with me twisting
Cantata of Soothing, while a ranger was main healer. In the end the
shammy got in just before we got to the mob we were supposed to kill.
We finished the adventure with 40 minutes to spare.

The moral, if there is one, is cleric, shaman or druid (and under
certain circumstances maybe ranger or paladin) can be an adequate
healer, if the player knows what he is doing, and the rest of the team
are alert to their limitations. If we had had a cleric the adventure
would have been laughably easy, as it was it was fun.
