OK, a little more to go on. I read that if you take a screen shot in
windowed mode that it will not create a file, but instead it will copy the
data to the clip board. So I opened Word and did a Paste command, and sure
enough, there was my shot. However, I then tried doing my screenshot in full
window mode, and still ended up with my screenshot on the clipboard instead
of in a file. Then I thought maybe I needed to starte the program in full
window mode, so I shut it down and rebooted EQ in full window mode, took
several screenshots, and it did the same thing. It's putting them on the
clipboard instead of creating a file.

Any ideas?
