Firstly, I'm wondering what my spell list should be? At the moment I have:
Clarity, Alacrity, Mez AOE, Enthrall, Tashani, Curse of the Simple Mind,
Listless Power and finally Tepid Deeds. Is this looking ok? So far the only
29 research spell I have made is Enstill and I'm not even sure what use that
one is...

Secondly, which is the best mez, Mez or Enthrall?

Thirdly, I'm a bit lacking in armour and need something to aim for. Only
300pp to spend atm but that will get bumped up a bit I'm sure. I have the
Oracle robe, some raw silk and some AC carrying bracers with INT on etc (my
int is 149 btw). but thats about it. Any suggestions?

Also, where to hunt next after I get done with High Keep?

Erm, there was more but I forgot. Any feedback appreciated. /bow /kneel etc.

TTFN
