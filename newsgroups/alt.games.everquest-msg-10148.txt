I carry my JBoots in a backpack.  When I want to fire the boots,
I hit:

   shift-4 (switch to fourth hotkey bank)
   2       (open the backpack I have hotkeyed in that slot)
   click on Jboots  (in the now open backpack to pick them up)
   click on the hotkeyed backpack (this puts the JBoots into a
                      main inventory slot and puts the backpack
                      on my mouse pointer
   right-click   (without moving my mouse, it's already over
                 the JBoots from the last operation).

This sounds complex, but it's quite fast once you practice it
a few times.  I'm now fast-footed again and running for my
life if need be, and can do the following at my leisure:

  click on the JBoots (this swaps the backpack and the JBoots again)
  right-click  (without moving mouse, this opens the backpack)
  put the JBoots back into the backpack where they came from.

Yeah, it's a bit more work, but it beats permanently wasting a
main inventory slot, and/or actually *wearing* the JBoots
(shudder) full time and losing a bunch of AC.
