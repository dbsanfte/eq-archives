Re-read what is highlighted. If you _are_ affected - report it! You have
my full support. However, what is happening in _many_ cases is reporting
names, which whomever report does not find distracting or offensive, but
thinks they are against the rules and reports them to let GM decide.

And there are plonkers like 'Sand Jumping Indiana' that reports obscure,
boarder line ones, but not in-your-face-against-the-rules ones just
because they happened to belong to someone he knows and like.
