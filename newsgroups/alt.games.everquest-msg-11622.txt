Can't speak for najena but my level 24 Druid got his butt
kicked by a new blue to me casting goblin in Everfrost
Goblin Lackey, also in same area and aggroed with lackey a
Goblin Miner (green to me).  They were both in the Tower
with Eichvul who went in somewhere around the time the
Warrens opened if I remember correctly.  Looked like the
typical Ice Gobbos seen in everfrost/perma.

Also in Butcherblock, not too far from Kaladim is a spawn of
Crazed Goblins blue to a level 35, red to a level 24, and
took several hits of 100+ from the guards to go down.  

Also wondering if since you now get positive faction with
King Xorbb, can you kill enough runnyeye goblins to become
non KOS in the Gorge?
