That's just it. I do use Google exclusively except for occasional
reading in Agent when I want a change of pace. I find Agent a bit
cumbersome for my use though. When my post failed on Google the other
night, I immediately attempted to post the same using Agent through my
ISP's news server and got a message with the exact same verbage.

Honestly, I don't know for sure if I have ever actually posted using
Agent.
