Thats crap. Clerics can (and do) offer so much more than a cheal chain on 1
warrior

Probably 90% of all raids (and 90% of each raid) is split tanking, ae's,
group heals only, etc etc

Sure for that final mob a cheal rotation may be required, but even then your
fate is not sealed.  Group heals, cures, MGB heals, MoK, DI, BoV are all
duties performed by clerics (either on or off the rotation)
