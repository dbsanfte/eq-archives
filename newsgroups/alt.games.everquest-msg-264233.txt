While this means they have to start pressing the DVD's now (or, 
realistically, it means they already started pressing them a few weeks 
back), it doesn't mean the game has to be ready now... it only means 
they have to have a working patcher on the disc.

To avoid massive massive download times, it would also help if -most- of 
the files on the disc are in their final state... but this is probably 
the case, the content of most zones probably won't change, what will are 
tweaks to the engine itself for the most part.

So, you fire up the game, it checks with the patcher, finds out that the 
EQ2main has changed, downloads the fresh version of that, and off you 
go; the game is state of the art as of nov 9, even though they printed 
it back in september.

I haven't played a computer game in years that really worked correctly 
right out of the box... which is a huge problem for me, as I buy most 
games during the 4 month period where I'm offline; I can't play EQ 
without an internet connection, so I'm in the market for single player 
stuff, but if I buy something, I can't actually play it without patching 
it first!  Solution is to buy stuff while I have a connection, and try 
to estimate how much I'll need to get thru the netless time... or to 
find a rental PC I can use to burn patches onto discs to take home.

But for a game like EQ thats never a problem, if you can't connect you 
can't play, and if you can connect, you can download patches all day 
long (and in some cases, its taken that long!)

In particular, no EQ product in my memory ever worked correctly right 
out of the box, they all immediately download patches, and in almost 
every case, SOE (and Verant before them) has had to stop the game and 
issue more patches repeatedly in the days or weeks after release, either 
of the original game, or the expansions.
