Since this seems to be the way to do it, I'll comply for now.  To address
your concerns, Mr. Mann, allow me to address them in the order received.

The posting method issue having been addressed, I will move on to the issue
concerning my intentions in this newsgroup.

Mr. Head says it's presumptious of me to presume that he presumes I'm here
to start trouble.  The way I see it, I'm here in a genuine capacity, and
based on the company I keep in another newsgroup/game, am under scrutiny by
certain members of this community.  Again, I reference my analogy, "judging
a book by the library in which it resides".

Further, I take particular exception to your presumption that I am "high" on
myself.  While I find myself intriguing;  dare I say... Interesting, I'm far
from "high".  I'm not even particularly fond of the sound of my own voice,
if that helps.  Also, I'm not baiting others to attack me.  If people choose
to attack me based on the simple fact that I'm here, it's on them.

Now, something that I wish you'd clear up.  You say I "make opposing claims
as to the reason for <my> presence here".  Could you be more specific?  As
I've said from the beginning, I'm here to learn more about this game and
community before I commit a single red cent to it.  I think there's nothing
wrong with that, but I've been known to think outside the box, so it's
subjective.

You're entitled to your opinion.  Don't forget that opinions typically run
both ways.
