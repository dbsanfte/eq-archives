Tap tanking is hugely mana-inefficient.  Essentially you have to match
the MOBs DPS with taps.  Additionally, even on a mount you miss a lot
of tics of med time because you are constantly tapping.  However you
can heal yourself better than you can heal your pet, and with good gear
you can damn near rival your pet for mitigation and certainly have more
HP than it.

I use tap tanking if I am full mana and feel like wasting a little (and
frustrating the warrior, hehe).  If you don't mind getting agro, a
necro can do amazing damage in a short period of time.  Nukes and taps
at the high end hit for anywhere from 1200 to several thousand HP of
damage (depending on ID focus effects, critical blasts, etc..)  They
also have no real recast time so you can cast them in quick succession.
 I also used tap tanking in my lower 60's to get my defense skills
up-to-speed.  I do it a lot while factioning too.  Your pet can only
kill one mob at a time, and hitting adds with nukes or dots sends tham
after you rather than the pet.  You really have no choice but to get
beat on when factioning higher-level greenies, IMO.

Tap tanking is also the only way a necro can solo a lot of summoning
mobs.  Typically on a summoning mob I start with a snare.  I now have
limited time to be prepared for it before it starts hitting me because
soon enough the snare will damage it enough that it is summoning.  Next
I hit it with a DOT tap and get summoned when the DOT hits.  I usually
just say screw it and start meleeing.  I have the scythe from Grieg's
End so I get some chunks of flesh that way.  (A necro AA turns the
flesh in to bone chips)  The DOT tap gives me some more time to channel
the regular taps as I need them.  If I get in trouble the mob is snared
so I can run away, get summoned, run some more and cast a spell before
I get hit again.  Or I can just feign and use my pet as a buffer while
I fix myself up.
