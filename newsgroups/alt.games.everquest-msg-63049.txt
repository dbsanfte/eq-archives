It *uses* a DLL.  Several, in fact (I see 8 DLL files in the
Everquest directory).

It does not, however, *install* any -- that is,
it places no DLLs in the Windows directory, nor anywhere else
where other applications (or Windows itself) would end up
using the ones which EQ supplies.  Nor does it cause any of
these EQ DLLs to be loaded by Windows when WIndows itself loads.

They remain completely inert until you actually run Everquest.
