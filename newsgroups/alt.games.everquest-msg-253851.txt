At 19 I started doing Frenzy for 30 points, at 21 I started doing Frenzy 
for 35 points.  This is one funny curve.  Skill at the moment is 87, 
still lagging behind but starting to catch up, it probably suffered a 
bit from my trying to get kick skill ups to possibly help intimidation.

Double attack plus triple frenzy, when all goes off on plan, can yeild 
me up to 190 points of damage with my current weapon (22/40 shissar 
claidmore) in a single round, although the frenzy timer is slower than 
my weapon timer, so you can't just divide  by four that to figure my 
theoretical max DPS.

I'd guess a rogue's theoretical max output with a nice 12 damage piercer 
in each hand (grimling mining picks, say, about as cheap and common as 
my claidmore) would be around the same, what with dual weild on top of 
the dual attack I have... if he can get behind the target.
