I play only one character and I have taken him to a high level. I
however notice many people have as much as 5 or 6 characters under 30
and have never know the 30 and above life. I have to respond to that by
saying you have no idea what you are missing out on staying under 30. I
was making 100pp+ a night after 28 with occasional 600pp nights.
I also saw a guy say he have been playing for over a year and hadn't hit
level 20 yet. How fast or slow have you guys gone? I hit 30 in 2.5
months with just normal play of 4 hours or less a night.
