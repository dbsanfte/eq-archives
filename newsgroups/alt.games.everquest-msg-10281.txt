One of the interviews I read said they would have that feature.
However, december is pretty far off and most people will have upgrades
by then. Take heart if your pocket book is strapped; when geforce 3
comes out for like 500 bucks I heard geforce 2 would drop from that
price to around 150 bucks (for the high end geforce2) since of course
you wont pay the same price for something worse than 3.

If you look at those models though, they are smoother and the texture
is better but i don't really know if they are that much more
intensive. EQ is really optimized like CRAP in its current form. Who
knows, maybe in the new engine it will be streamlined so it might run
even better. 

A lot of the lower level velious spell drop all the time off junk.
Players just don't try to sell them to other players much since they
don't sell well and they end up on vendors a lot. Some recent spells
which are drop only yet I found them on various vendors for like 12
plat, Tunares Request (druid level 55, non aggro charm animal),
Reckoning (cleric level 54 direct damage) etc. I sold gift of xev to a
mage for 100 plat the other day, I think this was a velious spell
which dropped off some holgaresh in wakening lands.

Actually that was in another interview I read recently, it said they
are getting away from the huge guild raid thing which you had in
velious and many of the even more uber areas of luclin are made for
like one group. 

You are not exactly right about velious either, you can actually get
pickup groups of like 6 people in kael and even the dwarf keep and do
pretty well (though ironically the dwarf keep is actually harder due
to odd pathing and sudden summon issues) Yeah, you'd need a guild to
do tov and the skyshrine or kael quest armors but really just 6 person
or so groups or more for thurg quest armors (parts drop in kael) In
fact I know a pally who got himself a full suit though our guild has
never done kael as a whole.

Actually come to think of it many areas in velious really require just
one group too.. don't need much more than one for velks, etc. I was in
upper skyshrine doing named wyverns and wurms with just one group from
my guild. It was kinda easy partially due to the fact we were allied
with CoV from doing kael.. and still allied when done since kael
faction pluses to CoV and dwarves are so high that afterwards you can
go nuts killing in skyshrine or on velious dragons.

Im planning on upgrading my computer some but not just for velious, in
fact if the stuff coming out like DAOC or AO are better, I might just
disappear from EQ. DAOC I read is kind of in the same vein as EQ but
has some improvements but also might not be as good in some ways. 

AO sounds miles ahead of EQ with such thing as personal questing you
receive a key for on an area with a difficulty set for you which ONLY
allows your entrance on the fly. It has a similar thing for a group,
meaning that for the first time an MMORGP gives you a sure fire way to
do something with a few select people without having others jump in.
These kind of private things to do are NEEDED in an MMORPG since you
can't EVER predict behavior. Verant thinking that In EQ players will
spread evenly throughout the world just doesn't work, lower guk is
jammed while Droga has one person camping the idol of the thorned. 

The legacy of EQ will be that it taught the other game makers how much
customers hate the waiting game and also just how much they will put
up with to keep playing an mmorpg.
