I was in OT. I (my alt wizard was on) was with a cleric, a warrior,
chanter, a rogue (who was AFK a lot), and a necro. Everything was
fine. I noticed that as my chanter buffs wore off, they were slow to
be replaced. Had to say it a few times.

I usually root and unload. The Chanter then took up the rooting so I
just bombed. Saves mana and the chanter can pay attention to the
rooting/tashing/debuffs. I just have to med and cast DD.

I stupidly root bombed a tiger. Was a Red mob. I got aggro and the
root broke. The chanter did not re root. I tried to fade, and while
fade was interrupted, I yelled heal. No Reroot, no heal. I died. A
guildie came along and gave me a 97 rez. I wondered what made the
chanter not root, and the healer not heal in a colorful way.

I find that the chanter and the cleric are botted. I wish he would
have said something. I suspect he was on a KVM switch (where you can
only see one monitor at a time) to make it worse.

After getting a rez I didn't perform to my utmost, and the party
suffered for it. I gated out, and camped.

I think that the guy should have made it known he was botting. Next
time I won't be in a group with a botter. It was a lousy group, but
what else is new with pick up groups in the OT.
