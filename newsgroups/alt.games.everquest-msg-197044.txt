I currently have EQ New Dawn UK - (EQ, Scars of V, LoY, Runes of K etc.). So
this pack did not have PoP included, so I order PoP separetely from UBI Soft
and it arrived this morning. However it appears that this version is EQ New
Dawn UK (I already have) + PoP - I thought it was going to be just an add on
for the existing EQ but its the whole deal all over again + PoP. I can't
figure out how to add just PoP to my current install. If I run the CD it
just says - add components from control panel but this just shows my current
install with no option to add PoP.

Looks like this package has it own unique AC key and all. Do I install this
version and use my original CD / AC key. I want to keep my existing
characters with the new PoP version.

Thanks.
