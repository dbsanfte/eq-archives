First - The rp reasons are just rationalizations.  Why not
go all the way back to the way it was in beta where, if you
were medding you couldn't do *anything*.  No chat, no inventory
stuff - *nothing*.  The rp explanation - you're medding, you
have to be still.

Second - What are you talking about that you don't *have* to
med?  Have you played an caster in a group?  What if you were
in a pre 35 group and discovered your cleric wasn't medding, 
just sitting watching the battle?  Would you say, "Hey, no
problem, we can pull at 1/3rd the rate to accomodate you." 

I can't imagine that you've played a caster to any level if
you truly believe that the roleplaying rationalizations override
the major impact to the enjoyability of many classes.

It already does.  Level 3 and under - respawn with food and a 
weapon.  Level 5 and under, no xp loss.  This is not qualitatively
different.  OTOH I could take or leave this change.

Brad had great vision, but I truly believe he was too inflexible.

I *HATE* that it is a feature of the game.  I *HATE* that I have to
trade of my wish to play a caster with periods of being nearly totally
cut off from the game I'm supposedly playing.

I'm sorry, I'm lost in the quotes, is this you Jeremiah?  If it
is, then I respectfully suggest that you have no clue how much
the spellbook impacts the enjoyability of the game, and no clue
how much it hurts the developement of group skills in classes 
otherwise thought of as soloers (mages/necros/druids).  Or how
it seriously hurt the upper level cleric population before Kunark
made them the only viable healers in high level encounters.  They
had to group, but, other than standing to cast a spell were completely
uninvolved in the combat.

I have 20 odd days played on a bard to level 25, but you will
never hear me tell you that bards don't have issues, or how to
play your bard based on that.  You have, obviously, a vast 
amount of experience informing your views.  OTOH, you'll have
to excuse me if your opinions on the validity of staring at
a spellbook instead of being immersed in the combat lack the
same authority.

Many things can be rationalized away using RP as an excuse.
The truth is, game mechanics have to exist to make the game
fun (that includes balanced) first, and the RP rationalizations
have to be assigned second.  There is a reason that the class
called Gatecallers who get the appellation Elementalist at 51
don't get TL's/Ports and cold based nukes, despite the apparent
RP sense in that - It's because it would unbalance the game,
thereby affecting the enjoyment of a large segment of it.

look at the chronology -
Beta - no chatting, inventory stuff while medding
RP - your character is medding, you can't do anything
else.  Part of the original vision of someone who wanted
a true RPG out of EQ.
Release - Chat/Inv allowed, but spellbook blocks view
Slight shift in posture.  your *Character* is medding,
but you the player can still engage in chat and moving
inventory (which has no real quantitative effect on 
the game).
Sometime post release - Spell book goes away at 35.
RP - Now, you develop in your abilities enough to 
be able to med by just sitting - It's just a rationalization,
some way to avoid condemning the original design decision.
Now - no spellbook
Well, the guy who's feeling we were protecting, by leaving
part of a bad design decision in, is gone, let's enhance
the enjoyment of all the casters under 35 by letting them in
on the fights they've only seen in their chat boxes up to 
now.
