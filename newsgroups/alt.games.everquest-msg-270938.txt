I understood, but implied rather than said it. My toons haven't much

Thats why I mentioned my highest level character has only newbie

I agree.

dipped into my armor upgrade funds. Sometimes that takes all of the
plat my 'toon had. So I do donate to the best of my 'toons' ability.

Oh, I don't expect everything for free. But someone who expects a
minimum amount of plat should say so in the /ooc announcing they are
casting something. Thats what bothered me the most about it. No hint
until the sarcastic remark when I offered 2 pat and was rejected. In
a rather short time there was competition charging less.

okay. Now the request for plat makes sense. But it should be made in
the /ooc, not an /ooc of them saying temp was available. Other times
I've seen requests for plat for buffs, it was in the /ooc made by
that player. No guessing required.

I saw the buffs were free, I never demanded they be free. A couple
of times I told them I had no plat, maybe later I can come back with
plat, they buffed anyway. Someone sat at one of the stones in POK,
about 2 weeks ago, and buffed as 'toons arriving from out of zone
into POK. No plat was asked. I offered and was told to not worry
about it.

Because it was happening for months. Lots of 'donate if you can
afford it' /ooc or no requets for plat at all. Then EQ2 happened.
The /ooc saying a certain minimum plat amount is required has been
on the rise. Usually 10, some are asking 20 plat. In a zone and for
a buff that many offered for free before.
