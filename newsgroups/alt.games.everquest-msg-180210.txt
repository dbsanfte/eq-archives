As a 31 Druid I just made my way to the Overthere. I am told the dragoons
have a huge aggro and travel at night? I am told that good races can sell to
a vendor at the "mud pit?" Where is that?  I am currently at the FM zone
line. Is this as good as any part of the zone for a 32 druid to solo? Or
should I be at the Skyfire zone or Warsilk's zone? Any other advice would be
welcomed. P.S. I bound my self in the FV bank so I can gate back and forth
to dump loot as I need to...but a CR would suck.
