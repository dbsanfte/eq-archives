Checking email with spamcop(clearing out/whitelisting my Held Mail to
see if any legit email got stuck) and saw a message apparently from
PayPal.

Curious, I saw the message was blocked by bl.spamcop.net, the main 'this
is spam' blacklist.  It also received a number of flags from
SpamAssassin:

tests=CLICK_BELOW,DATE_IN_FUTURE_06_12,HTML_70_80,
	      HTML_IMAGE_ONLY_06,HTML_LINK_CLICK_HERE,HTML_MESSAGE,
	      HTML_TAG_BALANCE_BODY,HTTP_EXCESSIVE_ESCAPES,
	      HTTP_USERNAME_USED,IN_REP_TO,MIME_HTML_ONLY,REFERENCES,
	      USERPASS

I was most interested in the 'excessive escapes' flag.  These, for the
uninformed, can be used to mask a true URL.  Indeed, inside the
message(HTML only, another red flag - PayPal never does that), I saw a
link that looked like: 

<a
href="http://www.paypal.com%2f@%32%31%31%2E%31%31%33%2E%31%38%36%2E%34%32/%70%70/%70%72%6F%63%65%73%73%69%6E%67%2E%68%74%6D">click
here</a>

Sorry about the wrapping, but you don't want to click it.  I did, and
found myself at the 'Processing Login...' screen of PayPal.  Odd, I
didn't remember logging in...

Oh, look.  PayPal wants my name, DOB, Credit card number, if it's debit
or credit, my....social security number?  My PIN?  My mother's maiden
name?

Yes, I had fun filling out my information(I never knew there could be a
city and state called 'Eat, ME')

Anyway, just a heads up.

My spamcop report, if you want to look it over is at:

http://spamcop.net/sc?id=z162636999za4486883d759474ac183234c56e0f858z,
or

Now, time to sleep.
