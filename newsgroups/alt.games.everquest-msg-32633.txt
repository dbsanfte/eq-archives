Read my more indepth reply to James in this thread.  I just posted it a
second ago.

Also, unless they're in an Undead zone, they got down there without my help.
Have I abandoned jerk groups in an undead zone?  Yes.  Once in the ghost
room at the bottom of Unrest.  But because they were royal jerks, I didn't
care what happened to them and really hoped they lost several levels trying
to get back out.  They did however whine to the zone about me abandoning
them.  In my defense, I simply told the zone what one of them did and how
the group said nothing when I brought it up in between pulls.  Luckily, the
group was clueless and said things that confirmed their level of maturity
... or rather immaturity.  In the end, they had every single cleric in the
zone tell them they wouldn't group with them and I got lots of invites to
join others groups who promised to nicely treat me.

If you still feel this way after reading my reply to James, I thank you for
leaving the zone and making sure I don't mistakingly group with you.

No, if one or more of them treats me poorly and the group does nothing to
correct it after I've told them, I feel I owe that group nothing.  As I
outlined in my reply to James, I've given them plenty of opportunity to
correct it.  If they die and lose levels, I view it as justice punishment
and maybe ... just maybe they'll think twice before treating the next cleric
poorly or standing silently by while one is being treated poorly.

Yes, possibly just for now.  However, if rude behavior is the accepted norm
at high levels in EQ, I guess I'll give Anarchy Online another try.
