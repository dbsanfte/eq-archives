   Um...depends on what you mean by "suck", I suppose.  FWIW, player
made 
arrows are a much better deal, even early on, then store bought ones.

    Um.  No.  I hate beggars.  I cringe when I see one.  I certainly
would
never _rely_ on begging to constantly supply a no rent item.  Even if
every
magician in the game, every single one of them, spent their days just
_praying_
that every ranger in game asked them for summoned arrows.  
   As for the quality of the arrows....well, yes...magic is good. 
Players 
can make magic arrows, but they are very expensive.  But, 3 damage, 50
range
arrows are not what I would call spectacular.  My work horse arrows, not
the
ones I make to raise my skills, are 4 dmg 150 range, and don't cost all
that
much to make.  It is true, however, that they are much more expensive
than 
the summoned ones.

Annie  <-- really, wishes _she_ could summon arrows.
