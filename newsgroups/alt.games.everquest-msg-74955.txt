Well, the *good* news is that it won't always be like this. Later on,
loot will be a trivial concern to you most of the time, when you get
into the higher levels and into a strong guild of friends, loot will be
on a "Need Before Greed" basis, and everyone will get a shot at things
that you'll still likely care about.

At your level, sadly, there will always be loot hogs. Everyone in their
teens needs a fair share of the loot to sell for armor, spells, etc. 
What you are experiencing is "Free for all" groups where it's sort of
"Grab what you can get", and pretend nobody really cares about the loot,
and is just there for the xp. 

You *can*, right up front, ask for a loot order to be established. Most
commonly at that level we had "alpha loot", where the group leader set
up and maintained the alphabetical order of the group by name, and
called who looted when, and rolling was only done on *really* nice/rare
items. It's a PITA, but a good group leader will do it if they have to. 

If you have enough trust in your partners (and vice versa) you can have
a "master looter" who will do all the looting, make note of their
starting money, and keep all the cash/items until the group breaks up
and then splits it up amongst people.

If your partners still won't agree to any sort of fair plan, you can
either quit to go look for a better group, or try a more "sublte" method
of gettin g your point across. By the end of the fight, rather than
sitting and medding like you're supposed to, get right up there on top
of the mob and melee a bit. When it falls, ninja loot a few. Then, next
fight, med through for a while and when people ask why you aren't
nuking, just say "I'm LOM! I need to med up. I lose med time every time
I have to fight for a chance to loot one of the mobs."

That may get the point across. Or it may get you booted, but if that's
the case, what have you really lost?
