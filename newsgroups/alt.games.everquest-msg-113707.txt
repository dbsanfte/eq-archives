This is a bit of a strange one as I am limited in serveral ways.

First off I am an Errudie Enchanter level 14.
I'm on FV and I play once a month with a group of friends.
Unfortunaly I have got a bit behind in levels and need to try to get to
16 before our next play session.
Further to this we are currently hunting the warrens (which is great
btw) so ideally I would want to stay in that neck of the world.
Finally I am usually limited to short play sessions during the week, so
it is far more convenient to solo than group.

So basically what I am looking for is a location and method of soloing
an enchanter from 14 to 16 on odus.

I have heard some word that there are options on kerran island, but I
have never been there and I'm not sure what levels it covers. 

So any ideas ?

Cheers,

Jim
