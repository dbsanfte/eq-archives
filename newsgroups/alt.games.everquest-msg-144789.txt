Not an exploit.  It is a hole for a a reason.

Yes that is an exploit.  You could try to make the argument that it should
be allowed as an offset for poor programming that should allow you to climb
up the side of the boat but does not, but I don't think you would win.
Regardless of that iffy, you don't have any way to extend that to allow
climbing through ceilings (or standing on phantom stacks of weapons).
