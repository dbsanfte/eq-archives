I think Verant actually are just banning random accounts, to create a scare
for hackers (This ISN'T the first time this has happend). The ones who don't
contact Customer Service have probably hacked sometime, and the ones that do
contact get their accounts back.

Look at it another way.. Verant are being nice.. they are trying to give you
your life back, and since less and less people play these days, its much
like wandering alone on a Single Player game anyway.
