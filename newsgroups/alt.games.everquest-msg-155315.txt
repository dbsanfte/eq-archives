Been refreshing the server status page to check on server uptime.  Last
refresh, this little blurb has been added:
==============================
Troubleshooting Stuck Characters
If you are having troubles accessing only one of your characters from the
server select screen then please follow the directions below in order to
remedy your problem.

First, exit the game to your Windows desktop, and double click on the "My
Computer" icon. Go into the EverQuest directory (the default location is
"c:\\program files\\everquest"), and delete the files for the zone that you
were last in, or zoning into (the file names will start with the zone name).
While in the EverQuest directory you will want to also delete all files
ending in the ".opt" extension along with the zone files.

Another suggestion would be to temporarily disable your sound in EverQuest.
In order to do this, create a new, blank text file and name it
"NOSOUND.TXT". Save this file into your EverQuest directory (the default
location is "C:\\Program Files\\EverQuest\\"). You will not have sound in
the game while this file exists, but it can help us narrow down the cause of
the problem.

If either of these do not allow you to login under your character, you will
have to contact the GM for your server with a different character, so he or
she can log in under your account and "walk" the character out of the zone
it is stuck in.
