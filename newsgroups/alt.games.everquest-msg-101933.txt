Actually, I get a much better vibe out of your second case than the 
first. "sow plz" is not manners, it's just the hollow appearance of 
manners. It's not even the abreviation, since "sow please" is hardly any 
better... It still sounds like an order, even with the "please" tagged to 
it. On the other hand, "Could I have SoW, plz?" *is* polite, even if it 
uses the dreaded "plz".

On the other hand, "sow me" always is met with "go fuck yourself", or as 
Woody Allen put it, "Be fruitful and multiply, but not on those words".
