You know what balances the low level focuses?
Level restriction on spells.  They only affect
spells that are lower in level than the next
higher focus in that line.

E.G. Middle of the line bracer only works on
spells to 53, because you get to summon the
top of the line at 54.  

Yeah, an average of ~10% extra damage is overpowering
on a 100 damage bolt.  Remember the ring doesn't
effect spells with cast times of less than 4 seconds
anymore, so it's pretty worthless on most lowlevel
mage nukes.  Hmmm, with the choker on I have a 15%
chance to not use a malachite when summoning my pet.
With the mantle on, buffs last a *random* amount
longer.  Messing up the ability to time buffs by 
casting them on yourself.  The earring, well, I've
only soloed with my earth pet in the hole since the
patch.  Malosi, 2 antisummoned spells - let spike
finish it.  It's hard to tell how much the aggro
reduction helps, because the mob is rooted.  

Also, the extra AC/Hp/mana is limited by level.
If you are lower than the level in item description,
you get reduced stats.  I gave a 34 wizzie the
top end choker/mantle and the middle ring/bracer/ear
and the choker and mantel (recommended level of 48)
gave him only 15 hp/mana instead of the 20 they give
me.
