That's a really elegant system and a good starting list. Although it's
a tad too late for me to repair the damage with the dervishes, oh well.
I think your system breaks down a bit in karana, isn't there a mob that
cons as indifferent but will aggro you? (which I always thought was
pretty cheap).

I'm considering writing up a `descriptive' faction list. There's lots
of faction knowledge out there but seeing how it all fits together
can be somewhat confusing.

I also like the fact that I now actively support the froglok's in
the defense of their ancestral homes from the ravening creatures
of darkness (eg trolls and ogres).
