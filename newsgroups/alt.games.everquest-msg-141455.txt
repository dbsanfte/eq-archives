Best way I've found to get archery up is to get a fast bow (carved elm silk
or better) and then fight mobs that will run when they get low HP,  then
finish them with the bow as soon as they turn to run.  Since you have some
healing spells you could be cruel and heal the mob, then shoot him down,
heal, shoot, heal, shoot, untill you get your skill where you want it.
