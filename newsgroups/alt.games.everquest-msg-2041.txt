You are right, that's exactly what you have to do. However, it really
isn't that hard to do with practice. And since they added the drop
confirmation box, it isn't even risky. The trick is to have all the
keys you need next to each other.

You have to use three of your lower left slots. Go to your inventory
screen, make sure you can see all your wear locations. Click and hold
on your primary melee slot until it pops off onto your cursor. Drop it
into one of your lower left slots. This is the actual weapon slot,
where you equip and remove the item, not the melee hotkey you use for
autoattack.

Repeat with the secondary melee slot where you normally equip a
shield. Finally, pick an inventory slot that doesn't have a container
in it. Click and hold it until it pops off, and drop it into a lower
left slot. This slot is where you will keep your shield.

Make sure all three slots are close together, and move autoattack and
bash along side. Normally, you should have your two handed weapon in
the primary melee slot, and the shield in the inventory slot. Enter
combat normally, swinging your two-handed weapon. Whenever your bash
hotkey is ungreyed, watch for your autoattack to cycle. Most two
handed weapons have delays over 40, so you have four seconds for this
manoeuvre, plenty of time. Press autoattack to turn it off. This step
isn't a necessity, but if you don't do it you might waste a couple
seconds punching your target. Then, pick up your melee weapon, and
drop it on top of your shield in the inventory slot, which picks the
shield up. Drop the shield into your offhand slot, press bash, then
pick the shield up again. Drop it into the inventory slot, which picks
up your 2 handed weapon. Drop the weapon into your primary melee slot,
and press autoattack. Then wait for bash to cycle and repeat.

This might sound a little confusing, but it really is a simple
procedure once you practice it. While you are first learning it, don't
bother turning off autoattack until you get the timing down.
Basically, there are 9 steps.

1. Turn off autoattack.
2. Pick up melee weapon.
3. Switch melee weapon with shield.
4. Drop shield into secondary melee slot.
5. Press bash.
6. Pick up shield.
7. Switch shield and melee weapon.
8. Drop melee weapon back into the primary melee slot.
9. Press autoattack.

With a 45 delay weapon, this allows a half second per step. In
reality, it will take much less time with a bit of practice.
