They have a natural racial regeneration faster than other races.

This is an edge over them so in theory, to balance the classes as the asses
at sony think they must do down to the last detail, they give them an exp
penalty. Keep in mind I can give my lvl 2 SK troll Smacktard some nice twink
gear and a kick butt weapon and he can kill blues in two hits while taking
very little damage. Sony balances, players unbalance in responce.
