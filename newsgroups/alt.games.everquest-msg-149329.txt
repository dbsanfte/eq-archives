CoD is a DoT.  Sing it once and it lasts 3 tics.  Sing it a second time and you get
one more tic... or only one tic out of the first one, whichever way you want to
look at it.  IIRC, DDD is the same plan.  So you sing CoD, DDD, selos, and
back to CoD just as the first was wearing off, back to DDD just as the first
of those was wearing off, back to selos just as that was wearing off... maximum
effect with all three running constantly.

Bellow is a DD.  This means that if you want maximum bellow effect, you
sing it constantly... or actually stop, start, stop, start singing it gives you even
more damage per minute.  However, depending on your skill and instruments,
CoD and DDD will probably each do more damage per minute than chain
bellowing, so you use bellow only to fill in the gap between more useful
songs.  Bellow also has longer range, which makes it handy at portions of your
loop where you are further from the mob.

At later levels, you'll get targetable DOT spells that have long range and do
decent damage, and can shove bellows to the back of the book.  As a bard
you'll see more additions to your tactical options grow more than probably any
class.

Bard is indeed hard work, a lazy bard is probably one of the least powerful
clharacters out there, while a finely tuned one can be one of the best.  I doubt
there's a class out there where the player matters more.
