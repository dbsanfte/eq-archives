How about the more contentious, and less grounded in objective
fact "Bizbee is a scumsucking pig"?

Has proponents on both sides of the debate, doesnt it?

"Pol Pot is a genocidal maniac" is, it seems to me, not even really
an expression of opinion; it contains two assertations. That he
was genocidal, and that he was a maniac. Both of those are terms
with reasonably well understood definitions whereby a coherent
argument is feasible on entirely objective grounds. It seems to be
more an (accurate or otherwise) statement of fact.

The opinions being talked about here, as I suspect you well know,
Bizbee, are *subjective* ones; and that seems to me to be a whole
'nother kettle of fish.

Sui, wondering how the fish got in the kettle anyway.
