The "company" is a mini-mall  type shop off of Little Creek Blvd and Bay
Avenue.  Since he went mainly ebay awhile ago, he tend's to be able to take
more vacations... it's these vacations that earns him the negative ratings
(ie slow deliveries, responses, etc.).

Decent price on the item, though as Tukka just pointed out, pricewatch.com
seems to be the place to keep an eye on prices, hence its name I suppose. :)

You -will- get the item from this fellow though, I have no doubts about
that, though, you shouldn't hold me to that either (that would be about the
time he would stiff ya), though, when you will get it is a different story.
You may get lucky and he may not be on vacation at the time. :)

No, I havent ordered from him.. rather, used to chat often when I lived
right down the road from his shop (the original one that is) near the Naval
Air Station.  After that, I only visited occasionally.
