That's only fair, since it's an EQ title, meant to capitalize off the
popularity of EQ.

I'm not my father, either, but that doesn't mean I'm not related to him.

No, but any other company can deliver a comparable product.  They have a
monopoly over the name only.  And, judging by your opinion of LoE, you don't
consider the name to be a deciding factor.

That's one helluva assumption, but continue.

Er, no.  Assuming your premise that no one wants LoE, they are trying ot get
us to buy something we don't want for $50.00, by bundling it into something
we do want.

You call it slimy, I call it good marketing.  And it seems to be working.

Funny how it works like that, sometimes.  You have these ideas floating
around, but it's harder to hammer them out into an argument.

I have a difficult time believing that LoE is just an elaborate attempt to
sell EQ2 Beta slots.  Hell, it would have cost alot less to simply charge
$10.00 and save the R&D money sunk into LoE.  I can believe, however, that
SoE saw that the demand for LoE wasn't what they thought it would be, so
they added a little kicker so they didn't have to take the financial black
eye, as well as loose face.  If LoE doesn't sell well, and after SWG, people
are going to start wondering.

It adds value to the LoE game.

/shrug.

If they can get away with it, more power to them.

That really doesn't bother me.  It's their property, they're entitled to
have a monopoly on it.

In the end, it doesn't make any more difference what MMORPG you play than it
does what jeans you wear.  Either way, you'll use what you like better.  The
product, however, is essentially the same.

You can find it distateful if you wish.  I think it's a great idea,
personally.  It put me over the edge on whether to buy LoE or not.

Which I think is none of the government's business.  If I want a loan, I'll
go to a bank which doesn't have such a requirement (and is, therefore,
stealing all the business from those that do).
