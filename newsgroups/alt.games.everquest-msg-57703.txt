It does.  Once you use a discipline, *all* of your disciplines become
unavailable until the recharge time wears off.

This is why Resistant and such become useless.   10 bonus to all resists, yay!
I've spent hours trying to get items that have just that.   But when it means
that I'll be taking 30% more melee damage because I'm not under defensive...
or I'll do a couple hundred less damage since I'm not using Mightystrike...
Resists don't help as much as either of those.
