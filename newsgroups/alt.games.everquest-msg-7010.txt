The regen is great at very early levels, but at higher level, it pales
to what the healers in your group will be doing.  The main job of a
warrior is to do a fair amount of melee damage while keeping the mob's
wrath focused on the warrior, so that the higher damage but more fragile
classes can work undisturbed.  Not being stunned is a huge advantage.
