No, don't think that's it... I was standing to cast EoZ in Kedge into a 
wall.  Eyeball appears, switch to Eye POV in some other room, swim around 
a bit, don't spot Phinny...  But, if I took the eyeball and swam upwards 
for a bit, when I snapped back to my character, I would find him floating 
about the same height above where he started.  Is that synchrony of 
movement tied to auto stand somehow?
