Right, 'common' has always been called 'human' on FV as long as I've been
there, and you are correct, the actual 'common' is elvish. I'm guessing the
reason for that is there are more elves, or were at one time, than any other
race, being played on that server.

It's a little different in that I've had several cases where players
wouldn't say anything OOC at all; send them a tell asking a question, and
they just stare at you in character and do an RP emote of 'Soandso shrugs, a
pensive look on his face, perhaps wondering when the dwarf will say
something.' or something along those lines. This was usually when I was on a
quick CR before work and just didn't have time for RP'ing a sow request or
something. :P Others are more lenient about it, just depends, but I still
think FV is far different than other servers. Just me 2cp.
