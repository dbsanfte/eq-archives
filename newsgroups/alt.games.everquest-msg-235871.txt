Upon death a certain amount of xp is deducted. A rez will restore a
percentage of that xp. Nothing happens to any xp you've earned between
the death and the rez. The restored xp is simply added back into the
total.

However, if she's been on the account for more than 3 hours since
dying (doesn't matter what character, server, or even if just sitting
at server or character select), the rez timer will have expired by
now.
