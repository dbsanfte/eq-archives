it should be alright to run it, the ram is low but my ex hubby's system only
had 256 in it and he found it playable, other than that I'm running 2
windows of eq just fine on a system that yours squishes lol, amd 750 with a
32 mb graphics card and 516 ram (sad but works lol)
You'll just have to run with the old models on, texture caching probably
help a good bit as well :) (go intot he options screen where you log in)
(excuse me if this doesn't make much sense, been awake a total of 10 minutes
now)
