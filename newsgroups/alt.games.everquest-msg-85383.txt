The thing is, how long are these other games going to remain free? I know if
I had designed a game and had an update on its way, I would be giving
serious thought to changing to Sony/Verant's pricing model. (subscribers
paying wheather they play or not, is pretty attractive to your accountants)
as well as ensuring a healthy cash flow while you design the next product.
