    Ak'Anon is great fun, once you figure out what the buildings in town are
called. Ask one of the Guide bots to lead you someplace, and it does. The
problem is figuring out what stuff is called in town - the bots don't
respond to some of the normal phrases you'd use. What I really think should
be done, instead of trails of sparkles or other nonsense, is just make the
map tool (with all its notated starting town maps) a part of the main game.
Why invent a new tool to solve a problem that's already been solved with an
old tool?
