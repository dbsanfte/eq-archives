1) You WILL be OOM. If you're not, you're probably doing something wrong.

2) The mob WILL aggro on you if nuke it, debuff it, DOT it, heal party
members, buff party members, or look at it funny.

3) Once again, you WILL be OOM.

4) Necros will always kick ass. It's sad, but true.

5) You WILL be asked to bind, buff, TP, SOW, shine shoes, clean windows, and
empty the litter box.

6) Did I mention you'll be OOM?

7) High elves look sexy in robes. Gnomes just look stupid regardless of what
they're wearing.

8) Druids have the largest percentage of stupidity.

9) Enchanters and Clerics will ALWAYS be asked to join a group.

10) Shammys and Enchanters will ALWAYS be asked to buff.

11) Shammys and Druids will ALWAYS be asked to SOW

12) Druids and Wizards will ALWAYS be asked to port.

13) Magicians and Necros...good luck.

14) Casters are always the vitems of nerfs.

15) Maybe I should mention you'll be OOM?

16) You'll never be able to gate when you need to. Ever.

17) Bards are NOT casters!

18) Bards ARE a good source of mana, vitamen C, and riboflavin.

19) People who write stupid lists have too much time on their hands, and
usually a mediocre sense of humor to boot.

20) You WILL be OOM.
