All,

I started Everquest on Day 1. However, I always waffled on what to
play and I've never had a character over level 21, ever, and I played
constantly for the first two years. I bounced around between tons of
characters and I was always struggling with the fact that I love
Travel Magic but hated the glass jaw of the Wizard and was bored by
Druids. I tried all the other classes too but I wasted a lot of time
(but had fun!). I've restarted and quit several times.

At this point I've finally realized that for me, overall, the
Necromancer is probably the best class. I won't go into the reasons.
Anyway, there aren't any other massively multiplayer games that really
intrigue me, not even among those coming out, except maybe WoW. So, my
inclination is to get back into EQ and really go hard and fast and
enjoy a Necromancer.

However EQ2 is on the horizon. I don't know whether to play EQ1 and
put a lot of effort in or not. If EQ2 ends up being great, I will feel
split between them. EQ1 is the older product, after all. However with
better graphics engines going into EQ1 and all the other nice stuff, I
am kinda wanting to start EQ1 again. I'm just worried about EQ2. It
frustrates me that it is even out there. Or it frustrates me that they
aren't cancelling EQ1 when they launch EQ2. I feel like I risk
"wasting my time" (aside from the fact that I'll be having fun).

Then there is WoW. It is the only other universe and massively
multiplayer game that tempts me at all. I'm not as tempted as I might
be, however, because I don't really have any kind of feel for what the
game is like.

So, I'm looking for advice. Should I restart EQ1? (I already own
everything through Legacy of Y) Should I wait for EQ2? Should I want
for WoW?

And does anyone else have these concerns?

Lewis
