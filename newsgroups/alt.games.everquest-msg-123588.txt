Well, to be honest, I don't run into too many mobs that DT yet.  We have a
significant lack of bards in our guild.  A lot of people don't know how
useful a well played bard can really be unfortunately, so they are not
played as much as other classes, so there are not a huge number of well
played bards, so noone knows how useful they can really be....

Most situations, the MA gets aggro before we try debuffing, in cases where
that is not feasible, ie, the mob must be slowed if the MA is going to have
a decent chance of surviving, then we cast away, and possibly die as a
result.  Most situations we are in, the enchanters are very handy to have
for crowd control.  I'm sure, that if the guild gets enough high levels to
start hitting more mobs that DT, we will figure out how best to deal with it
at that time.
