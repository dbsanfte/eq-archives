Bear in mind I support clerics ask for money for rezzing if they
feel its impinging on their playtime.

I can think of a good reason for this; I enjoy gaining xp. Its fun. I hate
travelling. When I die and cant get a rez or only get a 50% one my
reaction is generally "Shit happens, dont worry."

On the other hand when I get stranded in great divide or Tox and
have to be in, for example, sebilis, and I cant find a port my reaction
is "GWAAAAAAAGGGGGGH STUPID ASS LONG RUN"
