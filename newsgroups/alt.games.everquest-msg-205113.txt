Once you hit the 50s in EQ, I'd say that you have a valid point. Until
then, there isn't much equipment worth looting even if you hunt in a
full group all the time. Given the price of Ry'gor, Crusty, spiderful,
Seb Scale armor, no chain or plate wearer is gonna be looting
equipment if he made even a minimal commitment to making money on his
way to 50th lvl. It does admittedly change at higher levels where a
good group can pick up some nice equipment these days.
