Move my bind point from the soulbinder in POK, where its been since I 
was a wee mage of 1 season?  (except for a couple momentary lapses, but 
I got a cleric to atone me for those)  Blasphemy!

Plus, its Firiona Vie, so I can't just bind right where I want to 
anyway, has to be a spot where melee can be bound.  Is there really a 
spot closer than POK?  As a gnome I'm KOS to Ogres, so inside Ogguk 
isn't as handy as you might think.

Yep yep, Jail is good cash.  Gaolers are ok too while I wait for Jail. 
Going to try tunnels or guardians again now that I'm 65, but so far I 
can't solo there realistically, single pulls weren't happening at 64.

I'm also eager to get CotAM and try a charmed Enforcer, see if he's 
better than my air pet.  Hmm, since my air pet can take one without any 
help from me, perhaps not.  Oh wait, thats an air pet with 85% haste, a 
48 point DS, plate armor, two 140dd proccing weapons, a belt and a haste 
mask.  If an unbuffed ungeared enforcer is the equivalent of that, one 
that's my pet should be nearly twice as good!

How many other zones have worthwhile CotAM targets?  BOT is the one I 
hear about constantly, anywhere else?  Course I'm still 39kpp shy of the 
current asking price on CotAM, so it will be a while before I can find out.

Splendid One
