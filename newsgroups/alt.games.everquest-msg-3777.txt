Just make sure that whatever race you pick, your Str, Con, Dex and Agi
are all over 75. While you can compensate for low stats with
equipment, it might mean you have to lose some AC, which is never a
good idea for a warrior. For instance my warrior has 70 dex, so I am
forced to use a 3 AC face equipment with +7 dex instead of a 7 AC fine
plate visor.

You will never solo if you are a warrior. It is not quite impossible,
however after a battle with even the weakest exp mobs for your level,
you will be so beat up that it will take forever to recuperate. It is
an interesting aspect of Everquest that the warrior is one of the most
powerful character in a group, but is by far one of the weakest solo
(apparently only the rogue is tougher solo). The only melee class with
any skill in this area is a Monk. If you like soloing, try a Hybrid, I
think Shadow Knights are best at this.
