There are explicit minimum speeds.  Just not very often.  I think I 
remember seeing a few of them in... Indiana?  I think it was Indiana.

I have a vague feeling there's even one or two in California.  But they 
would, of course, be superceded by the basic speed law.  The general idea 
though, is to tell that hippie in the VW microbus that won't go over 40 to 
-get off the dang expressway!-

Yes, I admit it, I've been that hippie.  But it was a Volvo.  Poor ol' 
Lurch.  Ahh, I miss him. :/
