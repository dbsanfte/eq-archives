Ok, if you say it's reasonable, and I say it's unreasonable...

Wait, I already knew the definition of subjective...  Hope there's something
more useful coming up, or at least a bit more entertaining.

Ya know, that leap to my empty and devoid life totally escaped me.  Because
I understand the concept that people have different beliefs and morals, and
tolerate same, my life is empty and devoid?  By the way, just so I can
actually keep up...  "Your complaint here" refers to what exactly?  I know
the person I was responding had a complaint, I was merely flaming.

I can already tell how empty and devoid your life is, though.  I mean,
seriously, you're using a computer.  Just ask an Amish person what they
think about that.  Obviously you need to change your ways, because the Amish
think your morals are teh suk.

Subjectivity.  Some people understand it.  Some people are so far deep in it
they can't even tell it exists.
