I've read a couple of posts claiming that there is a utility or two that
are "password stealers", but never seen a post that names names.

If such a thing exists, then the normal precausions wouldn't necessariily
apply.

The client editors, log parsers, server monitors are, I feel, legitamate
utilities that wouldn't fall under the same category as something like
showeq.

While the comparison to a rape victim isn't an apples-to-apples comparison,
maybe a more reasonable comparison, since theft is the issue, would be
someone being put in jail, because their car was stolen and used to run down
some school kids waiting on the school bus.
Sure, Verant isn't putting anyone in Jail, but the point being made was that
the victim is the one being punished.
For some reason, folks seem to think that this is becoming an acceptable
attitude. Few people speak out against legislation that would hold a firearm
owner liable for a crime comited with a weapon stolen from them. Same
concept isn' it ?
