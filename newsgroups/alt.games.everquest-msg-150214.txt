Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. It's always been this way.
It could be that the name you had was in violation and a GM/Guide on
duty at the time you were re-creating the character rejected it
manually. ....what was the name?

The random name generator doesn't know whether or not a name will be
accepted. It simply generates a batch of random letters based on a
specified template. Fantasy name generators have been around for
ages... The name it suggested could either already be in use or could
have bounced off the filter because it just so happens that something
in that batch of letters raised a red flag...

Ah, I see, your main point is to exagerrate the shortcomings. Since
there's no bug involved, of course you're not going to get a lot of
help.

Yeah...pick a different name.
