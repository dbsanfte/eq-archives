aye, the problem sounds like ram, it's trying to use virtual memory, which
basically uses your hard drive for extra memory.  Your hard drive is
accessed slower than memory, so what would normally take almost no time to
find on your memory, your computer has to send a read head to the correct
spot on your hard drive, and then read the information, before going onto
the next spot, etc. etc.  Thats the thrashing you are getting.
