0.5^9 would probably be correct to calculate the chances that you
would get a run of either heads or tails.  To calculate the chances of
getting only a run of heads, it would be 0.5^10, which is just under
.1%...but this is a minor point.

As I recall (it's been about 5 years since I took stats) it isn't as
simple as this.  With such events you actually have to calculate the
likelihood of a run of ten *not* occuring.  In other words, if there
is a .098% chance that you will get heads, ten times in a row, with
ten throws, then you would actually take 99.9023% (the chances of a
run of ten heads not occuring) and raise it to the 91st power. 
Subtract the result from 100% and you get about an 8.5% chance that a
run of ten heads will result from flipping coin 100 times.

This is the way I remember my statistics.
