Fortunately bards get an AA ability called Boastful Bellow, which has
a stun component and a much shorter recast time (18 seconds?), and
also the song Saryrn's Scream of Pain, which doesn't stun but has a
knockback which interrupts if you're lucky.  Mez is probably better
than knockback, though, since it is guaranteed to interrupt if it
land, even if it is annoying to pet users.

As a former bard, I did occasionally use mez to interrupt, but the
problem is that with a 3 second cast time[1] it's hard to get in in
time - if you know what the mob is casting, that makes it a much more
viable option.

[1] Not to mention that as a bard you are always casting something so
you'll have to interrupt whatever song you're playing and let one of
your songs drop to do this
