I disagree.  IMO all of the D&D rulesets have been weak in every
area except learning curve (it's always been easy to jump in and
play even when you're clueless about what you're jumping into).
The weakness of the ruleset(s) didn't matter when you had a decent
GM, and ease of play plus easy learning curve is actually pretty
attractive with the GM right there at the table (for a while at
least).  But 3rd edition is a load of stinking manure as an online
ruleset, and Bioware did a magnificent job of making things 10x
worse by catering to the arcade/console kiddies with dozens of
utterly moronic alterations/interpretations.

NWN could've been great, even with the D&D ruleset as a starting
point.  But in the end the dumbfucks sabotaged the world creator
in so many ways that it just isn't worth the effort to deal with.

I loved GURPS, but it came too late, I couldn't get my gaming
friends to embrace it.  Traveller and, much later, Cyberpunk were
brief anamolies.  Paranoia held our attention for a while, but as
the game system revolved around its rather shallow default setting
our interest waned after a while.  We were still using Rolemaster
and AD&D when the last two active campaigns faded into the sunset.
Bits of Chivalry and Sorcery were grafted into a "homebuilt" game
system based on the old Chainmail books in the first campaign I
ever played in.  (You think EQ was tough at release?  Hah!  You
never played in "Don's Dungeon".)
