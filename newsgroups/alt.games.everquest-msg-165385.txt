Not true.  Not all AA programs are quotas (disguised or otherwise).
And my objection stands.  Attacking an ideal strictly based on an
objectionable implementation is politicking, not debate.

Well, if that's what you really want.  Somehow it seems as if you'd
be at least a wee bit uncomfortable there tho.

Oh get off it.  Throughout history, and even today, wealth is amassed
most often at gunpoint (swordpoint before they had guns, spearpoint
before that).  Inherited wealth is not by any stretch of the imagination
earned.  It is a circumstance of birth.  So is nationality.  The whole
fucking world, you and I included, discriminates on a daily basis,
actively and passively, knowingly and unknowingly, on the basis of
circumstances of birth.  Your arguments, so far, are just political
bullshit, resting uneasily atop enormous heaps of unspoken assumptions
and convenient half-truths.

I'm waiting to see an argument worth a damn in support of your
position.  If you want to be honest and argue about racial quotas,
go for it, I'll step aside.  If you want to continue making
statements that turn out to be absurd when examined in detail, I'll
be right here waiting.

Tell me, how is inherited wealth earned?  Let's just start with
that one, keep it nice and simple.  Tell me again, how little
Johnny earned Daddy's wealth.  If you can make it that far, maybe
we'll consider how hiring the Pinkerton's to kill, maim, and
intimidate your employees "earns" wealth.  From there we'll just
just move around and look at lots of other instances of wealth.
But let's confine ourselves to America, eh?  We're plenty messy
enough here without adding in all those foreigners.

Tossing aside for the moment the problematic question of just what
constitutes "your own merit", I'd sure love to see an argument in
support of your rather odd and pejorative characterization of
Affirmative Action given there.

I dismiss bullshit quite easily.  You have yet to make a single argument
that is distinguishable in any useful way from the populist rants on any
side of any political question I've ever looked at.

You speak of "merit" without defining it.  You speak of circumstances
of birth while attempting to insist that inherited wealth is not such
a circumstance (/boggle).  You try to tell me that inherited wealth is
earned... if it wasn't so incredibly ludicrous there'd be smoke coming
out my ears.

On the other hand, if you want to be honest and start attacking
racial quotas specificly without the (initially unspoken) bullshit
of equating Affirmative Action with said quotas, all my complaints
about what you're on about evaporate.  The dumbass Democrats who
decided to implement some AA programs as racial quotas went to a
lot of trouble to try to spin their quotas as not-quotas, and I
recall a lot of Republican bitching about it at the time.  So now
the right-wingers conveniently forget any difference and just refer
to AA as if it were a synonym for quotas.  Well, guess what?  That's
no more honest than the jerks you were accusing of dishonesty over
the same damned subject a few years back.
