How big are the tunnels and such in Sol B? I'd love to go there, but I'm afraid
I'll have the same concerns as in CT.  I'm a troll. Unless you can count on finding
a shaman to shrink you, CT can be a death trap for you and others if you've got a
mile wide fat ass like mine. ;-)
  Is Sol B any easier to navigate?
