Hello from misc.writing.  So, is that what you chess
people call a particularly inopportune opening
move -- "white trash?"

Actually, I've never thought much about this particular
combination -- racism and chess.  It sounds like it 
would make an intersting chess set, no?  All the little
white pawns in pointy hoods, George Wallace as the King,
some Identity guys as Bishops, a burning cross for a rook.

Then, maybe on the other side, MLK as, well, King, Al Sharpton
and Jesse Jackson as Bishops...


Yeah, that's the ticket.  Coming to a Franklin Mint store near
you...
