Prices go up if people are 'playing' to get extra funds.  Whether they're
running a bot, sharing a farming character to play 24x7, paying someone for
in-game items or currency (who then runs a bot or farms), or just playing a
ton, it doesn't matter.  All that matters is that more money is coming into
the game.  Of course, items are ALSO coming into the game, which works to keep
prices down.  

My point is that the game itself is designed so that money and items are
created from nothing.  It happens all the time, and botting accelerates it
marginally.  Other cheats can accellerate it far more, of course.

So can players.

Bots are also far easier to KS from or otherwise deal with in-game than gangs
of farmers.

I believe this is a far smaller effect than playstyle and playtime has.  It's
possible I'm wrong.  Most of my experience in the "competition for spawns and
groups" comes from EQ rather than WoW, and there it's completely obvious that
people are the problem, not cheating.

I guess I just don't understand why you CARE what the reason is that you
missed a spawn or group spot.   Losing to a no-lifer with great equipment and
losing to a fool who you suspect botted a bunch of tradeskill stuff feels the
same, doesn't it?
