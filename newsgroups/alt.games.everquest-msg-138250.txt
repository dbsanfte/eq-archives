<snip reasons>

The thing is, jaZZ, that what some of the folks here talking about
soloing are only talking about specific mobs at specific level ranges.

At 54, with my rogue...I WILL solo A Great Plague Skeleton (always
level 39), I WILL solo A Greater Barbed Skeleton (36-40), I won't
even ATTEMPT A Greater Plague Skeleton (39-42) simply because
if my luck is bad and it's a level 41 or 42 mob, I CANNOT take 'em.
I know from experience and testing what blue mobs I can handle
(old world or not) and which I can't.

I won't attempt An Ember Hornet, because even though I can
luck up and completely destroy a level 39 one, the level 41 EH's
kick my ass.  Sometimes if I'm lucky enough to not get an add,
I can Heal kite one with my Jboots (run far enough away for it
to stop, stop and heal (faster than it regens), go back and finish
it off.  But THAT's really risky.

I could kill Plaguebone Thieves in the Dreadlands at the same
time I could NOT kill a Greater Spurbone wanderer in the same
place, simply because the PT's will run at 15% or so, while the GS's
won't, and I don't have the hps to last that last 15% unless I was
lucky and ID went off during the fight.

Not all mobs at the same level are equal.  DSP critters generally
have weak melee and not too many hps (kinda like anti-giants).
I can perfectly well believe that some of the zelniaks for instance
are completely soloable by a level 45ish warrior after he's
bandaged to half.  Long as he can keep up decent DPS and start
from half health, downtime is ONLY the time it takes to bandage.

If you have to heal further than half (and cannot heal/regen) faster
than a "normal" player, even being able to kill one blue isn't worth
the time.
