Just hit Deadmines tonight. We held our own but it was definitely more 
challenging!

In EQ2 it's common knowledge that you don't ever go out and kill mobs 
without having some quests driving the action. You do quests and the kills 
and xp will come. Sounds like both you guys are saying this is also true in 
WoW. My experience with the game is still sufficiently limited and anecdotal 
that I can accept on faith that you guys feel the same way that I do, even 
though I don't yet see it. Interesting difference of perspectives, eh?

Ahh, exactly what I was looking for, thanks for the reference!  The more I 
see of this game, the better I understand it. Still, after spending most of 
the night tonight playing EQ2 I recalled all the reasons I prefer the quests 
of EQ2. We took five people in our guild through a Heritage quest and just 
about dinged a guild level in the process, it was enormously fun and 
engaging on a level that I have yet to see in WoW. I hope that the influence 
of guys like Furor and Tigole is felt soon.

I dont know if you had a chance to read my account of the Lord Everling 
event in Nektropos Castle (see thread entitled "Lord Everling must die") but 
are there quests in WoW similar to this in scope, complexity, challenge and 
diversity of experience? Nektropos Castle exemplifies imo the best of EQ2's 
depth and challenge, taking a full group nearly 4 hours to complete on a 
wonderful roller coaster ride of an experience. This is what brings me back 
...
