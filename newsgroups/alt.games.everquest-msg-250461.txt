The flaw I see with your stance on this is that I don't think you can
have a middle ground here. Once any corporation decides to go down
that route and make money from in-game items or player accounts, why
should anyone believe that they won't do as much as they think they
can get away with to maximize their profits in that regard?  

Why not manufacture items out of thin air? Why not adjust the drop
rate and stats on items to maximize your sales potential of those
items? Why not make all the drops hard-as-hell to get, it would give
mor players incentive to buy the item instead?

Not true. It's value is set by comparing it to any other items for
that particular race/class/slot and there is where I see the problem.
There's too much incentive to start manipulating everything once you
start down that road.
