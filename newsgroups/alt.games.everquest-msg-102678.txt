I had a similar problem with Zone Alarm.  Here is how I solved it.  I
opened Zone Alarm and went to the Programs section.  In the programs
section I deleted the Everquest file; at each delete Zone Alarm popped
up a previous version of Everquest.  I deleted each version of
Everquest until there was no Everquest listed in allowed programs for
Zone Alarm.  I restarted Windows and when I started up EQ, I got the
dialog box.  

I think the problem happens because of the number of versions stored
in Zone Alarm gets to large.  Deleting the previous versions lets the
Zone Alarm dialog box work properly.
