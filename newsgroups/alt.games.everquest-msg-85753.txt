For skill BUILDING, no stat can be high enough ;o)
Check out the message(EZ) boards on EQTraders.com for various articles on
building Int or Wis cheaply

there's no cap on a stat for skill building... for ANY skill/stat combo (Str
for melee, Dex for Rogue/Monk/Missile skills... etc)

lots of example stuff snipped

I've said for YEARS that Jade HP/Mana jewelry is one of THE most overlooked
twink items for lowbie casters... especially Int casters that only had +4
Int on the plat Rose rings (this was pre-Velium *wink*)

If you can afford to buy them, and you've nothing against twinking a newbie
caster alt, then grab a set of Jade and Black Sapphire jewelry... and don't
worry about replacing them until you're in your mid or late 20's... you're
maxxing your mana pool (at a level where each point of Int/Wis is worth less
than 5 mana) and the extra 100+ HP will save your life (or give a Necro more
room to move).

Since the post-200 Int/Wis cap has been lifted I'll modify the above
statement a little... if you can start your char with Int/Wis way above 200
(maybe 230+) then I'd go for the pure stat boosts earlier... but only if
you're guaranteed grouping opportunities that will compensate for the lower
HP totals :o)
