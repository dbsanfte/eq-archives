Hm, the original post hasn't shown up on my server yet, so I guess
I'll just add my remarks onto Lance's.

As always, you can use the alt-O Options window, under Keyboard, to
see what keys access things.  In the case of the combat disciplines,
the default is you can use ctrl-1 through ctrl-8 to activate them,
analogous to using alt-# for spell gems.

I regularly use computer tools that require ctrl- and alt- modifiers on
keyboard commands, so I have no problem doing that.  I use the mouse
mostly for clicking on inventory and such, and for the spell-gem menus.
And the mouse wheel for zooming maps and scanning merchant inventories.
So I guess I'm a hard core keyboard addict. :-)  I even use "U" for doors,
PoK books, and merchants, and I have a hotkey for looting most corpses.

As Lance mentions later, some tomes are at the LDoN camp in EC.  I don't
recall which are where.

Yup, handy that.  Though sometimes I prefer to throw a shuriken
instead, if only because it gives me just a little more time to
start moving while the weapon is flying toward the mob.

Sometimes I throw stones during a melee, just for fun. :-)  Heck,
maybe 1 extra damage has made a difference sometimes.

Yes, and it irritates me no end that Alla's doesn't list some of
these newer disciplines.  I have Phantom Zephyr (requires level 35)
which lets me lull a single target for two ticks; I'm not sure how
often I can use it (but it seems to recycle in time for each new
pull).  I think the next lull discipline is at level 50.

Yes, Monks get it at 10, though I didn't learn about it until my
mid-20s.  It's not much, but I won't sneer at 30 hp.  Would you
turn down +1 regen, for free?  It's only +0.6 regen, but it's still
free.

At level 30 there's Resistant, which adds about 20 to various saves,
lasts 5 minutes, usable every 30 minutes (I think).  It uses the same
timer as Focussed Will, so you can't use the regen disc for those 30
minutes.

At 40 there's Fearless, but I haven't got there yet so I don't know
what it does or which timer it uses.

Speaking of timers, the Phantom Zephyr and Throw Stone are on a
separate timer from Resistant and Focussed Will, so you can use them
while Resistant is running, for example.  But Zephyr and Stone use
the same timer themselves, so you can't lull one mob and then pull
the other with a stone; you have to use some other way to tag the
unlulled mob.

As for other changes in monks since a year ago, I'm afraid I can't
help you, since I've only been playing for 8-9 months so I don't
know what monks were like before that.
