Follow-up...

Thank you for the advice.  I have bought the expansion
but...err...forgot to register it.  A typical newbie mistake.  I've
since done so, and have visited the wonderful moon of Luclin.

Another quick question...what does the trading quest do?  This is the
first I've heard of it. I must admit, I was a little daunted by
Luclin, particularly the Bazaar...the lag time was unreal!

Again, much thanks to you (and all other who responded) for the
advice!
