People ask me for a rez all the time while anon.  Same with my druid
and ports.  Some of them even cuss me out for not responding.

Little clue for the AGE crowd, if you are anon, I assume its
because you don't want people bothering you out of the
blue for your services.

Asking me for my services while anon yourself is perhaps
the most disrespectful approach I can imagine.

You could at least pretend to be a decent fellow, by taking
anon off before asking!

Bergh "selectively deaf" Brelltender, 60 cleric
Srimp "selectively deaf" Scampi, 34 druid
Llyric "tone deaf", 40 bard

ps if I'm anon its because I've been instructed to do so
by my guild, so that a who cleric 60 doesn't telegraph
where my guild is racing to get to a rare spawn ffa
mob... or maybe I'm in a newbie zone but in no mood
to PL everyone there at the cost of my mana.  Its
quite rare.
