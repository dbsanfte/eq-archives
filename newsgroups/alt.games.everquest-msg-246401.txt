And there are times when you just DON'T want to group, for whatever reason.
Perhaps you're planning to be afk a lot; soloing is best for that, because
you don't have to worry about pissing off a group or leaving them high and
dry for several periods. Or maybe you just like soloing, grouping once in a
while for comaraderie (sp) or for hard-to-solo mobs. Or perhaps, like I tend
to do, you want to get in a little (15-30 minutes) of play time in the
mornings while waking up and before seriously getting ready for work. :P

The game is multiplayer, and the emphasis is on grouping, but that doesn't
mean that grouping should be ALL you can do. I remember an EQ cartoon where
a character was trying to use the bank, but couldn't; when he asked why, one
of his friends told him, 'Variant (shows how old it is) has decided you need
to be grouped to do that, too.' What's wrong with being able to solo when
you wish to?
