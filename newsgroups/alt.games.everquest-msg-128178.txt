Hail Bards!,

I am a level 14 Vah Shir Bard.  I have having a great time.  I was told by a
friend that I needed to set up some twisting hotkeys.  I don't know really
how to do this.  Can someone explain this?  How can I set up a hotbutton
that would twist 3 or 4 songs?

Also.....

He said that there is a way to make a hotkey that will switch out weaons for
instruments.  I can't figure that one out either.

Thanks for any tips you can send my humble way.
