Interesting...that's always been the time they would guarantee to keep
characters from inactive accounts, but until now, I'd never heard of them
actually deleting anything.  If they've actually started deleting now, I
wonder what prompted it?

I'm guessing that storing a character takes about 1K of storage.  I don't
think that is enough to make space an issue, unless they are in danger of
running up against some limits in the server software, such as on total size
of the character database or something like that, and need to push it off to
give time to fix it.

Still, if it were a space problem, I'd expect them to start with the oldest
inactive accounts, and work forward, but the poster above sounds like he was
not inactive for much over 3 months.

So, it is puzzling to me why they would delete characters.  If EQ2 was out,
I could see it, as a way to encourage people coming back to switch to EQ2
(if you have to start over...might as well start on the newer game).

ps: BTW, if it is a space problem, the cool way to deal with it would be,
when someone closes their account, give then am option to save their
characters, and warn them that if they don't, they might have to start over
if they come back.  If the player chooses to save the characters, you export
a dump of the the characters to a file on the client, and the server just
retains an MD5 checksum of the exported file.  Now, when the player
reactivates later, the client can upload the file, and the sever can verify
the checksum to make sure there was no tampering.  This reduces character
stores on the server for inactive accounts to 16 bytes for the MD5 checksum.
