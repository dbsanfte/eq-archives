I'll most definitely say that the only way to keep your character from being
"as good as" naked is by purchasing items.  Or is it that you picked camps
that dropped items for you, and therefore are exactly the sort of "passive
abuser" that makes NBG such an unfair system?

Ahh, yeah, that's exactly what it is.  Pick and choose where you exp, take
advantage of peoples' naive generosity in NBG groups.  To borrow someone
else's line, how very noble of you.

Laugh away.  I'm sure you've noticed the outpouring of support for your
undisputably dishonest position in this thread.  :P
