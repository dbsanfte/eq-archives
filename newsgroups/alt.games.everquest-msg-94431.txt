Actually, I specifically waited until the patch was immeninent, so that
we would know how long the faction reporting bug had stayed in.  It seemed
to me we'd be more likely to have non-flaming discussions if we were
discussing a bug in the recent past, rather than an ongoing bug.  It was
also fresh on my mind, because I helped a guildmate kill a quest mob
that morning, and now have an unknown big faction hit to figure out.
