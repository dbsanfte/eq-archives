OK...Let's look at what a Militia was in 18th Century America:
A group of neighborhood citizens who got together to practice military
drills to protect their homes, their crops and their families in case the
French or Spaniards or Native Americans or British attacked their town.

For such a militia to exist, the common folk of the town or village needed
to own their own firearms, and know how to use them.

It means the common folk have a right to defend themselves without having to
wait for the Imperial Army or the local Constable or whomever represents the
centralized government to show up on the scene.

The National Guard doesn't fit that bill.  The National Guard may be made up
of local folk, but it is under the jurisdiction and control of the
centralized State and Federal governments, not a local or neighborhood
militia.

(By contrast:  In some places, like the modern UK, it seems defending
yourself is considered a heinous crime by the State....'By golly, you're the
subject and property of the Crown, and it's the Crown's job to protect
you--how dare you take matters into your own hands!  The criminal isn't
assaulting you, he's assaulting the Crown!  How dare you act on behalf of
the Crown by defending yourself without permission!!')
