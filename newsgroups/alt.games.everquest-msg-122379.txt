My opinion of general abilities:

Run speed - essential.  I'm still surprised an ability that is this
useful made the final cut.

Regeneration - extremely useful to melee who can't self-heal.  useful
to robe wearers, kinda useful to priests and pallys.  

first aid - useful to any class that can go over 201 bind wounds, or
has a summon bandage item.  robe wearers are capped at 100.   I think
just about all others can get 201.  Druids can, don't know about
shammys and clerics.  

The rest are fluff, better raised with equipment than xp.  It's much
easier to raise stats and resists with equipment than spending 3 x
level 51 worth of xp.

lung capacity?  EB items are plentiful these days.

metabolism?  buy feast food from bakers. 

Your wisdom is 3 points away from 255?  If you spend points now, and
get better gear later, you can re-spend the points elsewhere.  My
prime stat is INT, and I have 255 INT from my HP/AC gear.  I don't
have a single item I wear because of the INT.

Need more HP?  Is 3 levels worth of XP really worth the 18 HP you'd
get from the stamina?


There are literally thousands of items in the game that increase
stats, resists, and hitpoints.  I can think of 1 item that increases
run speed (not counting horses) and 0 that increas it indoors.  And
off the top of my head I can think of 5 or so items that increase the
rate of health regen.  So in my opinion, run3, regen3, then move on to
arch skills.
