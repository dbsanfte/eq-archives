met a druid half-elf that didn't put any points into wisdom at all.  If he
tried he couldn't of had a lower mana pool.  Its actually impossible to  get
a lower mana pool for a druid than be a half-elf who didn't put any starting
points into it.  Of course he had now wis gear, although with him that far
into the hole, and about 20th, you'd think it would just be easier to
restart with better wisdom.

There is a definite difference between races and starting stats, but
equipment can make up for it.  And sometimes its just fun to be different
than the pack.  Like a gnome or halfing warrior.
