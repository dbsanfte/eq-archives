Would absolutely not recommend this.  The PoM entrance is in NToV
where many of the mobs are on GuardiansofVeeshan faction which AFAIK
is KoS to all and unfixable.  If the named had been cleared then
perhaps it would be possible although you're looking at coffin CR if
things go wrong - not sure anything in PoM is worth the effort, seems
a horribly broken and neglected zone.

I wouldn't like to think what run of the mill NToV mobs (hello Flurry
Drakes) would do to a Guild not used to or prepared for them.
