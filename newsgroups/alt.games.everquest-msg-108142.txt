Same server.

60 rogue is in uberguild.  Decked, AA'd, monster raids.
51 rogue started at level 30 in a family guild, where she'll stay.
She also gets to raid with lots of ally and friendly guilds.
15 rogue is a Luclin-release character.  Just fun to fart around
with, and looks neat in Faydark Ringmail armor.

Frankly, I just can't fight anything (ANYTHING) with any
character without trying to get behind it...
