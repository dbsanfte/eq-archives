I know a lot of people bag on us Legends players, but this is precisely the
reason I play on Legends and have no issue at all paying extra for it. Stuff
the myths of "uber-loot" - it all comes down to having GM's availiable when
you need them.

As a side - you don't get a tenth of the bullshit from jerk players on
Legends that you would on a normal server either - I guess the idiots
realise GM's that will listen and <act>,  are only a quick page away.

It's a pity really, that you you have to pay 40 bucks a month to enough
"policing" just to get people behaving the way they know they should anyway.
That's not a broadside aimed at pricing either - but aimed at human
nature...
