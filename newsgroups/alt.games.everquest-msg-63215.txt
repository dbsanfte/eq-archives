Soccer is a game, and people get pretty worked up over players scoring
with their hands.

On top of a game, EQ is an RPG, and as such it has conventions that some
people *do* take seriously, however much it may amaze you. If you can't
respect that, fine, but don't be surprised when someone /petitions if
you have given yourself a name that violates those conventions.
