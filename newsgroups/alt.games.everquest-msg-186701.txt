From the shadows, the mysterious Mudfish <dust@m-net.arbornet.org> (if
that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

I made the trek to ill omen just after luclin came out as a vah shir
on the FV server, which was fairly new at that time. When I decided to
leave, I headed back into DL. Wasn't a soul there of course (the
server's low popularity and the fact very few people were high enough
combined against me).

I got killed by a spider standing above the tunnel just as I moved
into the open the first time (I was coming from FV). Highly annoyed of
course, but could have been worse. (I deleveled to L24, I was going
back because I wanted to get riposte and was done with LoIO anyways)

So I walk back, get my corpse, and manage to make my way across DL no
problems, no sow, no players, poor armor, etc etc etc. Got through the
tunnel with no invis (had any mob got stuck in there I was dead meat
with no prayer of getting away).

Damn it was a relief to make it to the other side of that tunnel!
Smooth sailing all the way to the scion! The ordeal was over. Done
with.

When I got to her instead of hailing I hit auto attack. To this day I
don't know why I had that particular mental fart - my auto attack is
the + sign on the numpad, it's not like you can hit it accidently
while typing. I just sat back and stared at the screen in shock. It
had taken an hour to get the exp back I lost for the first death, and
over fifteen minutes of getting across a deserted DL at L25 unbuffed
warrior (I went and got my level back before trying again), and after
successfully doing it I die to the scion because of my own stupidity?

So, I feel your pain. :-p
