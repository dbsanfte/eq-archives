Im talking about everyones favourite subject: begging. I've not experienced it
much myself. I have a level 12 paladin, 10 ranger, 8 warrior and 11 necromancer
and ive levelled in what are supposed to be some of the worst areas: freeport
and qeynos and i just havent had it happen to me. I play on the rathe if that
makes a blind bit of difference. I thought maybe it's because my characters
arent high level so they dont have anything to offer but even so i can count on
the fingers of one hand the amount of times ive been approached by a begger,
beggar, whatever ;) when i began the game i didnt see a problem for asking for
SoW at the gates or tunnel but after reading how despised such behaviour was i
havent asked since. In my necros 11 levels i have been sowed once, unasked, and
that was by a druid i had grouped with to fight orcs and this is because after
reading about it here im too scared to ask a passing druid in case he screams
"Buff beggars like you have ruined your own land blah blah" in my face and i
get a reputation. Ive done corpse runs from nektolous to kithicor many times
when a simple sow would have been a god send but im not allowed to ask right?
if i ask im scum. Ill gladly help newbies, especially in neriak where i can
guide them to their guild halls and stuff and have found corpses expecting
nothing in return other than a thank you. The game world is populated with
characters behind which sits another guy, so why shun the whole community thing
by insisting that one may never ask for a favour? some guy in a similar thread
said "How dare you ask for SoW when you havent EARNED it?"  how the fuck do i
earn a sow? dance a scottish jig? and i like to earn my shit, when a guy in our
guild was offering free steins of moggok i said no thanks, i want to earn mine
but i believe the whole "Can i have SoW please?"  "yea sure type /d so i can
wipe you out" is way over the top.
