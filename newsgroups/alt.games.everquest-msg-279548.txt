I remember (many moons ago) my friends insisting that Asheron's Call was 
"the next big thing".  Later on they assured me that DAoC was "the next big 
thing".  Now it's WoW.

To Vladesch I say, play whatever game you want (and I really hope you enjoy 
it); but please grow up and stop acting like an adolescent and/or a geek 
(girls absolutely hate that).
