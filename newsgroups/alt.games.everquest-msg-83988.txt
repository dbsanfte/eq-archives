- Frog, 2 50+ groups including 3 tanks and 2 clerics is overkill, but not by
much.  One group primarily consisting of 55+ (inc 2 tanks, 2 clerics) is
plenty.
- Seahorse...dunno, haven't done one of those yet
- Brownie - bring a cleric, enchanter or necro and fear kite him...easy
- Fish - easy solo, assuming you mean the 'cuda.  The guides say any blue
fish can be the PH but they also mentioned the one at n900, n900...and
that's also the one that turned out to be tainted when we did it last
weekend.
- Furbie - CAN be done solo, though I'd suggest bringing a cleric and tank
if possible...he's going to eat through all your mana and then some, when
including the Tainted in there.

Err, this is assuming you're 50+.  At 44 I doubt if any of the above (with
the possible exception of the fish) can be done without a very large number
of people if you're doing it at the original poster's level.
