I lived on these until around level 55 when I simply ran out of room to keep
them mezzed.  Before level 61 I mostly counted on a fast root to lose the
critter.  THAT spell is NEVER taken down.

At level 29 you get aug.  Use that exclusively...if the tanks complain that
they aren't getting max haste (and very few will know), tell them to stuff
it.

Your skill will go up fast enough. <g>  Back in the 20s, especially with
inexperienced players, you don't really have that much time to do much more
than buff & crowd control, but I rarely take my nuke down (level 62 + 50AA)
unless there's some obvious need.  And now that almost nothing can be
stunned, that avenue is removed from me as well.

Yeah I didn't play with that much back then...in fact, I didn't even know it
was a rune-type spell until my low 50s.  I just assumed it was a melee buff
that no melee in their right mind would ever ask for.  Still, I think I'd
cast it if my mana pool was ok...yours sounds like it's rather low.
