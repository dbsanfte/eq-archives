I have a sit/stand hotkey, because it visually tells me whether
I'm sitting or standing at any given time.  No social hotkey I
can make nor keyboard shortcut I can use will do this.

I know it sounds silly, but there are plenty of times when I
can't tell if I'm sitting or standing (the more so if the
character I'm playing happens to be in wolf form), and while it
might waste only a split second to find out, that split second
will repeat itself on a minute to minute basis all the while I'm
playing; its easier for me and my slightly foggy memory to have
the status of my number two hotkey on every page of every
character be sit/stand; the only character I run that doesn't
have this key there is my bard, who rarely sits and who needs
every last hotkey slot he can squeeze out of the system... and
you should see me trying to actually sit down to med back charm
mana ( a rare occurance, but it can happen) without it!

I don't need that function of the spellbook hotkey, because the
book itself is very visible.

Most characters, however, have at least one page with my primary
attack key as hotkey one, again because I can visually watch it
grey and ungrey to determine my weapon cycle status.

I know people who tie Kick to other buttons, but I don't see how
thats useful compared to a key that greys itself out to tell me
when kick isn't available yet.

Sense Heading is tied to a hotkey which is tied to my turn keys;
I don't care when its available, but I do this so I use it every
time it is, as soon as it is.  When it caps out I take it back
off that hotkey slot so I don't get the spam.  I could tie it to
other buttons, but it seems I turn more than anything else.

Track I hotkey directly, I want to know when its up and when its
not.

Probably more I can't think of right at the moment.  All the same
idea; instead of shortcuts or hotkeys, if there's a reason to
want visual verification of a button's status, I hotkey it
directly.
