It is entirely relevant to what *I* was saying.

Your statement is just a few lines up...
    "Your chance to buy gear goes up, (after much 
     hastle) but thats not the desireable result."

Who's to say that wouldn't be the desirable result?

Come on. Don't stoop. "Phat lewts" has a connotation that you were surely 
striving for, but does so not apply here = cheap shot. How exactly does 
your own desire to obtain better gear by slightly (rolling only on select 
items instead of all) different means classify you as riteous and 
justified in your accusing others of chasing phat lewtz?

Bah, your idea of making everything NODROP and removing the Bazaar is 
interesting though. Not merely with regard to the issue at hand, but 
twinking in general.
