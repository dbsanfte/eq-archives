That got me curious to see how much +mana I could find on my server for sale
right now in the Bazaar.  I limited the search to Wizard items.  Picking the
highest +mana item for each slot (including primary, secondary, and range),
there was +860 mana for sale, for 101480 plat.

This included a Heirophant's Cloak for 18k (+75 mana), Boots of Flowing
Slime for 40k (+65 mana), Velkator's Spellbook for 20k (+100 mana), and Eye
of Innorruk for 8k (+55 mana).

Looking at less expensive items instead of those 4, instead of the
Heirophant's Cloak, there was something with +40 mana for 6000, and
something with +35 mana for 550.  Alternative to the boots was +35 mana for
3000.  Alternatives to the Spellbook were +60 mana for 2000 and +50 mana for
500.  Alternative to the Eye was +45 mana for 200.

So, going for second best makes it: +745 mana for 26680.

Going for third best in a couple slots makes it: +730 mana for 19730.
