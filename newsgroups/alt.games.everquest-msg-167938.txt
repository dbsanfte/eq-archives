*shrug* I never expect money for porting, so I don't demand up-front.
Of course, I only port when I'm not doing anything of any importance
at the time or when doing a favor for a fried/guildie... I tend to
find I can make money faster through actual hunting than porting.

Anyway, look at it from the passanger's point of view: People have
been known to demand payment for a port up front then either gate away
leaving the passanger screwed or port them to the wrong place and
strand them...
