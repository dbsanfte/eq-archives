Hopefully, soon.  :/  I got DE faction with Eiri long ago, and was 
wandering around FQ looking for the troll that sold the piece for the 
Trep Thilcan quest.  *sigh*  Little did I remember I'd managed to get 
proximity faction hits -Da Bashers during the whole battle of grobb 
thing.  Oops.  :p  I never did find out if the vendor had moved, but I 
stumbled into the warrior guildmaster, who kicked my ass, and when I 
looked up the guildmaster and the vendor in question, I discovered that 
they're both, oh joy, on da basher faction.  So - well, crossing my 
fingers that by "troll faction" he *does* mean "da basher" faction.  And 
hopefully NOT with -the other troll faction.  :p
