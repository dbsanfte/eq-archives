In this day of easy transport etc it is infuriating....however as a UK
game player I find it is useful to filter out those games where the demo
was good but the game fell over since going to gold, let the first patch
come out to fix the 1st ed bugs etc etc etc. which does really help with
game selection. WWII online looked really really good but having seen
friends buy in looks like something I aint going for.

The situation is reversed on some games...Operatino Flashpoint for one,
astounding game...great to listen to the people the other side of the
Atlantic complain for once (says he with a vindictive glee).

But surely you could mail order it from the US given the above easy
transport, games seem to be a reaosnable price dollar wise and with the
cost of shipping still seem to weigh in about what the RRP is here in the
UK....
