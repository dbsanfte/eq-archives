The problem parents face today is they have a much greater risk of
making an unwise decision. The number of ways a parent can go wrong
now is much greater than 20 years ago, this is a trend that shows no
sign of slowing. THis couples with the errors the grandparents made
and you get a situation where its impossible to raise a good kid
UNLESS you are willing to become the exception to the rule. Dont be
too quick to view parents as the problem when its really just a
symptom that requires almost superhuman effort to resolve.
