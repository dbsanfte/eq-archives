He does spawn in TM. Try the camp that is in between the
main Coterie castle and the GF zone. Camp 5 on the
eqatlas map.

Be aware it may take a long time to get him to spawn.
I was camping that camp for the Dragoon and it took
about 4 nights camping and I finally got him.

Camp just north of Katta Castellum Zone
camp 1 on eqatlas map:

Soldier
Trooper
Commander
Guard
Campaigner
Gladiator

Camp just east of that (camp 2):

Swordsman

Camp east of that with fencing (camp 3):

None

Castle (camp 4):

None

Camp south of Castle (camp 5):

Officer
Dragoon
Fighter
Cohort
