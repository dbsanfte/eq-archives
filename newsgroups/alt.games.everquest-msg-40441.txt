the only screenshot i can find of a cloak is one of the everquest chick
(isn't her name firiona vie?), which to me in no way suggests they'll have
cloaks for PC's in luclin.  being a newbie, i may be wrong, but someone else
in this thread told me cloaks were there for everyone in the beta, but it
was too laggy.  he went on to say there are cloaks for some of the special
NPC's, but that's about it.  which would be in keeping with firiona having a
cloak.   just playing the devil's advocate here.
