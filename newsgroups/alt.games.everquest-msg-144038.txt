Pick Lock works backwards from almost all other skills. You can only improve
the skill once your skill level is *higher* than the lock's difficulty.
The easiest lock in the game is the one in Befallen, and has a difficulty
of 11, I believe. So you'll need to go back to the trainers, drop enough
points in it to bring your skill up to 11, *then* go pick the lock in
Befallen until you've maxed your skill for your level (65) or have gotten
bored.

The Safehouse <www.thesafehouse.org> has a list of some the locks in the
game and their difficulties, if known. The difficulty for Freeport Bank
lock is 201, so don't bother with it any time soon...
