I would like to set up a couple of macros that perform as follows, but
I am having difficulty:

1. Who is this person standing in front of me.

I thought /who %t would work, but it does not.


2. Switch to me.

I know F1 selects yourself, but can F-keys be put on the icon block?

Thanks in advance.
