Four of us went to do this last weekend and it took just one clearing to
get the drop.  We pulled about 20 at a time...kept it from being tedious,
and all in all took less than 20 minutes. :)  This was the second time I
hunted for the gulf waters...previous time we got it after 30 or so mobs,
so it may not be as bad as you think.
