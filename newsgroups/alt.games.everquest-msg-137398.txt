I was on vacation when the new UI came out, so I just dowloaded it and
started using it last night.  It will take some getting used to, but I think
it will be great.  There are so many great new features that I'm not sure
what I like best.  So far I'm very pleased with:

    1. The ability to change chat color easily
    2. The new friends window
    3. The new spell book with 8 slots in rows-much easier to sort spells
    4. Ability to customize-I think I will have a lot of fun with this one
    5. Exact numerical skill level listed (now this is great-who would have
thought I knew how to speak Gnomish?)

I'm not sure about the new spell icons yet.  So many spells used the same
icon that it was hard to tell them apart, but some of the new ones are hard
to see (but the good news is they can be customized) I think the new icons
will be the hardest part to get used to.

WOW! everything is so big! That will take some getting used to.  I used the
original interface and never got used to the transparant one.

Oh yeah! how could I forget:

    6. 10 hot buttons per page-this is great!
    7. Pet Command box-haven't played my necro yet with new UI, but I think
this will be wonderful
    8. Ability to open multiple bags and put them side by side (heck being
able to move them at all is fantastic)

OK that's all for now.  What is your favorite new feature?  Discovered any
hidden treats?

How can anyone say Verant has fogotton about us? I feel so special. *giggle*
