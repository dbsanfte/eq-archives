That's a social issue.  One that isn't within my control, yours, or even
Sony's.

I think any monk that plays half as much as me will easily have considerably
better than 1/2 of my stats.

Hell, if I take off all my equipment and stand naked, I'm just about exactly
1/5th of my gear...

If they play the same amount of time, they have the option of finding a
guild that is active during their primetime.  If they have other extenuating
circumstances, which are entirely understandable, there isn't a "solution"
to a problem that exists outside of the mechanics of the game.

I also think that your ideal of diminishing returns is a bit off.  In fact,
there are diminishing returns in place on all stats *except* hp and mana
anyway.  The Anguish geared warrior that upgrades from a 110 AC BP to a 130
AC BP, when his AC is already 2500, gets very little actual AC out of it due
to soft caps (making these numbers up as I go along...  I don't pay
attention to warrior gear or average stats).
