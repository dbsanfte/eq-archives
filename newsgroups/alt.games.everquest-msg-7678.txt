No, actually they don't! :-) See my other post for the link. I think what 
probably happened is Verant bumped up the exp so they'd get more people to 
come to Kunark. Now that Kunark is nicely populated, I think they adjusted 
it 
back down (LOIO at least).

Warsliks is an excellent zone. It made me feel sick when I first went there 
(those d*mn trees), but I'm used to it now. The giant fort is great exp and 
I'd definitely recommend it over LOIO. Plus, for Iksar, the vendors for 
selling loot are much closer.
