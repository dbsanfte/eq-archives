It's self evident. A "Live person" when laid on a bed at any age can
survive by itself for a half hour given that the room is moderate
temperature and has oxygen. A fetus cannot. It is a parasitic organism
that is dependant on it's mothers body for life support. When it can
exist outside the womb and survive on it's own then and only then is
it a person.

Yes but the baby can theoretically survive without life support. Every
other state you mention is autonomous, the fetus cannot and is not.
