Naw, it's a step simpler.  I'm saying that, in my mind, it should be ok to 
curse.  I'd make a distinction, perhaps, between cursing and using 
language to harass or abuse, which really isn't ok no matter how I look at 
it.  In my mind, it should be perfectly all right, after I die for the 
umpteenth time in a day, to express my feelings to the lower limit of my 
vocabulary.  And if someone doesn't want to hear such terms, then hey, 
there is a filter.  Generally, I manage to restrain myself to using oaths 
like "@#$%&*!!!", which for me, at least, convey much of the same feeling.

To me, curse words convey a tremendous range of human emotion for a 
variety of purposes besides expressing anger, hatred, or rage.  Go listen 
to George Carlin's "seven dirty words" for about a thousand such examples.  
They can be a great source of humor, they can express delight or emphasis, 
and many other good things.  Condemning an ASCII string because some 
people have (what I consider to be) an unreasonable negative response to 
it just seems a bit silly to me.

}Always love that response. Why the hell would they put a rule up
}saying no obscene language if the /filter nullified that rule?

Err... I always assumed the rule predated the filter, and there was no 
motive to change it, especially since it helps cover their ass if any 
parents groups get involved.

I do find it strange, however, that those offended by such language so 
frequently turn the /filter off...
