As to what to go after, I guess it depends on your personal decision on loot
vs xp.  Not sure which ones drop the Rygor armor.  As for Harmony.  If you
have spell effects on, then you can see which ones you harmonied.  The way
to do harmony is to cast it on the mob that is in the center of the mobs you
want to pull, if there is one.  Watch the mobs to see which ones have spell
effects showing up on them.  If all the nearby mobs were affected, then you
pull the one that is closest to you.  If not all the mobs were affected,
then cast Harmony again on a different mob that was not affected.  What
Harmony actually does is significantly reduce the agro radius of the mobs,
but it does not completely eliminate it.  If you pull a mob right past a
harmonied mob, and they are social, then the harmonied one will agro.  There
was a decent tutorial posted a long time back, let me see if I can dig it
up.  Here is a link to it:
