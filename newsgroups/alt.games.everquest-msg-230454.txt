Heres how you do it. Buff up the pet including sow and speed. Turn off
his taunt. Do same for you minus speed, you aren't going to fight.
Next, find an area where you can run either in a large circle or back
and forth with distance. Your job in the fight is simple keep the
agro. Slow the nasty, DOT and have your Ice DD ready. Pull with slow
and run from the MoB. Send in the pet when you have it chasing you.
Run in circles or in long straight lines letting the pet hit the nasty
from behind till he gets the agro, When this happens; You cast DoT and
a DD again until you get the agro and run. The combination of the MoBs
slow and your pet regen should make healing the pet not necessary. I
was soloing MoBs in LoIO and later I was soloing the FV giants when
they were red to me. Takes time to learn how to do it, but trust me it
works. I even used this on reds with my newly created Necro since you
get less resists with necro spells.

As for dungeons, you need to know your dungeons, it isn't easy but
it's all about slow, speed, heals, DoTS, roots. You need to know your
MoB as not all hit as hard or have the same HP even though the con may
be the same.
