Didn't say they were the only class that pulled.

They do pull more than any other class though, and Im sure 9 in 10 people
would say pulling is a monks speciality (theres always 1 DT in 10 out there
who will disagree for the sake of arguing....)

So yes, when the whole pulling system is changed, it IS a nerf to the monk
class

In other news, rangers on test are out-agroing Duel-EB warriors with
archery, and new agro changes (allegedly, this is from a guild ranger crying
to me at the weekend)
