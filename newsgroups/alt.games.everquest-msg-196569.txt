Keep all the green goblin skins you find and any MT death salts. You can
either keep them and hand them in for faction to earn you a rather nice ring
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=12316 or if thats not your
thing sell them in the Bazaar for large amounts (40pp per skin 20pp per
salt)

The great thing about this zone is you should both be more than able to solo
here when a duos not possible.
