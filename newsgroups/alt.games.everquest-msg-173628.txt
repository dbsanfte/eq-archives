Irrelevent to my point.  Clinton received a clear majority of the
popular vote, Bush did not.  As Richard points out there is some
debate as to whether Gore actually had a larger number of ballots
cast for him, given the errors that occur in every election we
can't really tell the actual result from a tie.  But Bush is
President, he won the election by the rules we use.  I just get
tired of politicians lying as a matter of routine, the more bald
faced the lie the more irritating it is.
