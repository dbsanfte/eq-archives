I glad I've yet to aggro the centaurs in TS made life much easier
there. Allowed be to harvest easier and run from mobs, knowing I'm
not going to train centaurs also. Since, I've nearly out level them I
might have a pop at them, so I can do the Centaur mastery quest,
assuming there faction doesn't carry over to another zone.

On the subject of faction what's the deal in Zek and EL? I killed one
Seamist fairy and it said my faction with them got worse, ops. I also
killed a wolf (with a lot of help) in Rivervale and it said my faction
with 2 people got better and 1 got worse.  Are there any mobs I should
avoiding killing in these areas to maintain good faction?
