Ah, ok. So "can be cleared" was meant to mean when just the mini's and
dracho are up? In that case, certainly.  I've heard of some pretty
amazing shit being done by single groups of sixties with top end gear
and AA, but I'll confess I was really anxious to hear if there was a
combination and method that could take down Cazic himself with that few
people.

We've done all the mini's and dracho, but Cazic is.... well... we tried
it with six full groups. As I recall Cazic had a good laugh about it
with his buddies later. Though I hear he was bitching that he broke a
fingernail at one point.
