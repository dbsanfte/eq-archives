In Rathe Mountains, at the back hunting trash for XP. Nice and safe
solo/dualing.

Two idiots strike up a chat in OOC about how 'oober' they are.
Obviously farming HG for cash. Obviously physically or mentally
pre-pubescent.

How do you handle that? I ooc'ed take it to tell/channel and they just
got nasty about chatting in OOC. A petition went unanswered. I finally
did somethign else.

I have good people skills when the people are PCs or Sun workstations.
The flesh and blood people are another matter.

What are the comments from the peanut gallery?
