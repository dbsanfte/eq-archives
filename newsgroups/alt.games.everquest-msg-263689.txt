It's nice to see at least intelligent debate as opposed to the idiocy of "Kerry
Sux or Bush Sux" that so many of the newsgroup posts are about.

But to follow up a few points:

Currently in Tennessee, the sales tax rate is 9.75% (6% state and 3.75% local).
 There is also a 6% sales tax on food items, no relief is givin for clothing
and shelter.  

Also, the 100k is "before" tax.  And even though there has been some decent
points brought up, not counting the sales tax percentage, there has been no
mentioning of the other taxes we pay.

I currently own a home valued at roughly 120k for which I pay $800 in county
property tax and $125 in city tax and although this is deductable on my federal
taxes, it is not a 100% on what I pay, just what I earn.  So since I make an
average of $45k per year, it lowers my taxable income by $925, but only lowers
my trax liability by my tax rate which would be about a $180 deduction or a
still remaining $745 tax or another 1.6% of my income.

Add to this gasoline tax, entertainment tax (17% in Tennessee added to all move
tickets/sporting goods etc. etc.), wheel tax ($85-$120 per year), utilities tax
(federal/state) and countless of other hidden fees and taxes not counting the
other taxes and fees business owners must pay and you are approaching the 50%
figure.

The question is not whether it is 50% or not, but even at the 25% figure which
was brought up, is that really fair?  Think about it 1 out of every 4 dollars
you earn goes to government waste. If you think that there is no waste in
government, you need to read the budget approved this past year.  It is fillled
with a few thousand here a few million there that goes to absolutely NOTHING.
