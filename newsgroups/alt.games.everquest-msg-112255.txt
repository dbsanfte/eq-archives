I've mainly been doing Kael bank/arena recently, average number of ensnare
procs is about 4 per fight I guess (Once avater procs - which is often - Im
at 255 dex).. in about 7 hours of killing last night, there only 2 fights
total last night that i either   a) didnt proc ensnare   b) it totally
resisted me.

I dont doubt 'my' seb is like your seb...

I've managed to avoid that place for a long long time tho (I perma exped in
Seb from 52-60), been there 3 times in exp groups since 60 (not includin my
wizzy and his ae groups there).. excluding trak killing anyway
