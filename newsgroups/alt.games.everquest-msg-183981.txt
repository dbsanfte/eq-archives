I think it is more a reflection of the target market than what they
think the average PC-EQ player is/looks like.

1. EQOA lacks the richer chat interface and extended user interface
that allows for a more "mature" or rather involved form of
communitcation (no keyboard on PS2).

2. The average PS2 user is much younger than the average PC user.
There is some cross-over, but in general the PS2 is aimed at the teen
market and is much more popular/available to that age bracket.

3. If the computer showed a bunch of 30 somethings getting together
online to play a fanatasy game, how likely would parents be to buy
EQOA for their kids? I am not saying that the 30 somethings (myself
included) are a danger. I am merely pointing out that the image would
not look good to many parents.
