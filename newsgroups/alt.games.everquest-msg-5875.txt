I made a halfling druid last night just to "check things out" - I had never
been to Rivervale. I've also never played a short race.. so the perspective
was, uh, different! :-)  Of course, all my in-game friends were giving me
grief about playing a druid.  There is so much negativity around about
druids, that I'm not sure I could play one until level 29 to start that taxi
service.  I have to admit I've run into more druids who were jerks than ones
that were nice.. including more than one occasion where a druid was
powerlevelling another character and decimating an entire hunting area.
And, playing the "most popular" race/class kind of goes against what I'd
normally do. I think there were 10-12 level 1 druids in Rivervale last
night. Well, not like I have to make a decision one way or another right
this very second.. although my eight character slots are now full! :-)

I do make a fair bit of cash with my monk - brought home 20 plat or so from
my recent time spent in LOIO hunting down that Saranak courier. But, without
some sort of weight reducing bag, looking fine steel is gonna be tough.
Especially with all my Iksar issues!  I guess I could head to Kurns with
some summoned bags and see how that works - at least it's close enough to
vendors that I can sell to!
