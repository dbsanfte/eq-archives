Well, I did not expect such a diverse response. Just out of curiosity
I took the weapon (Smoldering Brand 9/22) and the haste item
 ( Swirlspine belt 16% AC4) and ran them in Copelands.

Comes out lile this:

Weapon without haste , total damage per min. is 430, with haste is 499

Ratio
 
430 = 100 %
499 = x

x = 116.04 %

The AC question becomes moot in this example.

I think the additon will help my 40 warr, Incidently, there is a
Stormfeather Talon in the off hand, together the two weapons get 641
damage per min with the belt.
