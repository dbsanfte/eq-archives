Nope.

Deep seated hatred of capitalism? Nope, personally I consider myself a 
capitalist. Yes there are a lot of anti Microsoft users of a far left 
wing political persuasion, but like most left wingers, they are in the 
minority - they're just very noisy.
Willful ignorance? I don't hate Macs...

Your use of the word "standardized" to describe Windows is being very 
kind. Do you think we should "standardize" all the cars on the road too 
so we only have the choice between for example Toyota, Toyota and Toyota 
in the interests of keeping our cars "standardized"?

There are two main reasons why many people detest Microsoft.

1. The quality of their products
2. Their business practices

Rather than spending hours explaining the many reasons why I, like many 
others, detest Microsoft with a vengence I will provide you with this 
link which includes a lot of the more general reasons:
