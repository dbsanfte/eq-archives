Interesting idea. How much aggro would/should such a spell incur? 10%
of a MOB's current hitpoints at the start of an engagement is a hell
of a lot more than 10% of what's left near the end of the engagement.
The natural inclination would be to use the spell at the start (which,
presumably, is why you called it "soften"), but I'd want to know what
sort of aggro it would induce. Too much and I'd probably not use it.

Still, it looks like the sort of improvement that should be
considered. It's a way of giving Wizards a way to contribute more to a
group without increasing their soloing ability.

The only weakness I see is that it is more helpful in mega-HP MOB
encounters than it is for run-of-the-mill-xp-grind stuff that doesn't
have the bezillion hitpoints of which 10% would be a significant
incentive to grab that Wizard looking for a group. I still like the
idea... I just haven't thought of a way to improve it. :)

Ah, a kill-shot spell. :)

Personally, I sort of dislike the all-or-nothing spells we have. It's
a legacy of only having Force Strike to play with at Level 20. That
really irritated me a lot back then. The only ones I use with any
regularity are Tishan's Clash and Tishan's Discord, because I'm a stun
freak.

I preferred the first idea. This second one doesn't excite me as much.
It also seems to me that it has the same issue of being a lot more
valuable in high-end raid situations than it would be for the
day-to-day grind.
