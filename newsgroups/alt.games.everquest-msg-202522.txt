<<You have to play within the confines of game mechanics. In other words
your choices are to group or solo with extended periods of downtime
since KEI was "nerfed". No amount of whining will change that, because
that is how the game is coded now.

You could always play a more "mana friendly" class if downtime is a
problem for you when soloing.>>>

I've played most classes as I've been playing almost since the beginning and
I've yet to find a "mana friendly" class.  Best I've found is my Necro and he's
still way too slow for me.  I've been in plenty of groups and unless you're in
a zone that's very easy and below your level with very little danger(which I
also consider very boring), you're gonna have enough downtime even in a good
group for the game to be too slow.  I don't understand how speeding up the game
for everyone is bad.  Why aren't you getting KEI in your group and fighting in
areas that are higher than you normally would be and getting more exp too?
