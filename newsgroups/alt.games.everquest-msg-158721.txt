You're playing a shaman and almost certainly well below the
zone where AC will make a significant difference.  Still, it's
a simple question for anyone taking cleric AC buffs:  if you
could have an item that upgraded your net (not raw) AC by 32,
would you upgrade if it meant having one less CHeal available
while fighting per hour?

On a pure reward basis, cleric AC buffs are the cheapest 'upgrade'
in the game...
