I dunno about you, but I could easily pass the trials on day 1 with my
guild.

We could do it using ANY class.

We've done it with 2 people botting 2 key classes in the group (monk+shaman,
rogue+cleric)

Don't talk shit about what the top guilds did and didn't do, WE arent the
ones who needed to exploit.

ps zones get nerfed because people like you whine whine whine fucking whine.
Look at the whining about HoH.   I hope you rot permanently in PoV with
every other noob recruited from karnors training it on a daily basis.
