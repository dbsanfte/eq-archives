Aye, I believe Sigil stated that SoE would market, publish and host - 
nothing more.

Beyond that, I've always felt that unfixed bugs are just par for the course 
with MMORPG's. It's all about progress and prioritization. From a business 
standpoint, only so many resources can be dedicated to fixing bugs. As the 
game progresses, new bugs will always be introduced into the mix. The total 
number of bugs that exist at any one time will always be prioritized by 
importance, not age. The length of time a particular bug has existed isn't 
nearly as important as the level of negative impact it has on the game as a 
whole.

Like it or not, it's the new content that keeps people paying to play. 
Therefore, it only stands to reason that it's the new bugs that will often 
get the most attention.
