	Ok, I asked a friend about this and she explained to me that after
level 46 a cleric gets 5 stuns.  Four of these are sort of paired, that 
is, there are two pairs on the each of two timers ( so you can only use
one of the pair) and one that's a sort of targeted AOE stun she never
uses because all it does is break mezzes and aggro uninvolved mobs
and set off traps and otherwise get her killed. The 3 or 4 stuns from level
46 and before don't seem to be linked to themselves or the later ones but
she hasn't loaded them in years because she decided that if the mobs
resist her level 68 spells 80% of the time there's no point in casting
something from when she was still chasing giant wasps through the Faydark.

	In fact, she told me that the only spells she casts on mobs any
more are heals when she gets the wrong target and mark of the blameless
when she gets tired of seeing "Fred is burned!".  She does admit to
trying to bash casters to interrupt them...
 
	I wonder if it's a sort of self-selection error, I mean,
people who want to bash and stun mobs and hit them with stuff would tend
to start paladins rather than clerics...  So it's not that clerics
don't do anything but heal and buff but rather that people who want to
do other things become, well, other things...
