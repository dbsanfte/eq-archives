Part of it is that many of the new MMORPG developers are looking at
the early days of EQ and what people complained about and avoiding
these "mistakes" that plagued EQ (i use the term "mistake" lightly),
so many new MMORPG's seem so sanitized and fearful of frustrating the
new player which seems more business driven than creatively driven
(SOE itself is very guilty of this). But heres the rub, so many rush
it out the door incompleted with little content that players become
bored quickly (SWG a prime example). Pretty visuals just dont cut it
on their own for very long.

Many seem to think the part we enjoyed most in EQ is the tradeskills
and spend much of their developing trying to beat EQ's tradeskills
(which isnt very hard really). I know many enjoy it, but dang, it gets
very tiresom sitting around a town clicking endlessly.

EQ2 is still probably a little ways off (as far as I know, Beta hasnt
even started yet). Given SOE's latest offerings, I dont have much hope
for it.

I think were all a little jaded with EQ as well. Not many games can
come close to the depth of EQ's content. Well, EQ has had almost 5
years to flesh it out.

Now is a great time to start EQ1. Its long over the initial growing
pains that complicate a new game. Its long established and jam packed
with content. Also being that the OP was a D&D player, EQ is very
influenced by many D&D concepts.

Luclin also brought new textures to all the old zones too. While the
geometry didnt change, the visuals improved a little. It will be
interesting to see what the new engine will bring to the table.
