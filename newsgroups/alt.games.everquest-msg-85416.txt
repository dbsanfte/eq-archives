Do this and get back to us; start up a Win2K Pro or XP Pro box - the
*second* you're up to the desktop and logged in, just run up task manager
and get a process count.

Watch as services like userinit et al start dropping off after a couple of
minutes.  There is much bookwork being done behind the scenes on a 2k/XP box
after a reboot/cold start even though it appears you're all ready to roll.

I think the waiting wasn't so much for the swap file as it was to let other
non-critical initialization services run their course without all of a
sudden having to contend with EQ loading its bloated-self into memory where
some of those services may forget entirely that they needed to go away.
