I was trying to point out that just because I only paid 13 bucks for the
pizza I don't expect it to be correct. Customer service is the issue here.
I get that the game has bugs. What I don't get is when I get burned by one
of them I have to get the run-around.

I am just annoyed that my pizza has onions on it, but I am really fucking pissed
off when the guy behind the counter is ignoring me and not fixing my fucking
pizza.

Not finding a bug is one thing, but not even looking for it is another.
And when a customer gets burned by one shouldn't you at least fix 'that'
occurrence of it? In a reasonably timely fashion?
