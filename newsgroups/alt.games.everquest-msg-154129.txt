Sorry, but "mastered HoT 6 months ago" folks are uber, no matter if 
uberer stuff has come to pass.  Do the uberer folks count them as uber? 
  No, of course not, but that doesn't change the facts.  If you want to 
be a slave to what VI handed out as high end content for the masses more 
power to you, but I pass.  I play games for fun with my friends or fun 
with folks soon to be my friends and we've found our own version of the 
high end game that doesn't involve all that crap.  It can't be nerfed 
either <g>.

Would it be great if VI came up with some other plan for high end 
content other than the directed flow from encounter to encounter and 
mostly generic tactics?  You said it.  In fact I've said it too, but 
that doesn't change the reality of what is, only what we'd like to see. 
    Until they provide an acceptable high end game my friends and I will 
continue to create our own high level game and I'll continue to feel bad 
for all  those folks who suffer so much when VI plays their silly games.
