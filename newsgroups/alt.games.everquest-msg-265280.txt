Mob spawning requires no work of anyone.  Everyone agrees that
there is something wrong with kill stealing. What is it? I feel
the best definition will find the worst effect of kill stealing
and be based on preventing it.  That's what the GMs for CoH did:
If someone is depriving you of XP for an extended period, they
are in violation of the policy.

An overly broad definition is of no use whatsoever. A very
specific definition that prevents the most harmful effects of
kill stealing is much, much better.
