Have a local made noname clone with integrated video.  Tried putting in 
a PNY nvidia GeForce2 and had to reformat the HD and reinstall everything.

Not so bad as I got the machine for my <gasp> 2nd EQ account and have 
both machines networked.  Just a little drag and drop and it was mostly 
back to business as usual.

Considering upgrading the audio now.  Hmmm, ouch I think.
