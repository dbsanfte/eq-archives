Well sure, charm, mez, fear...but also any MAGIC based nuke, which I THINK
Careless Lightning is a part (at least, it's not cold- nor heat-based).
And, not surprisingly, enchanter nukes. :)

Besides the mag/shm malise line, druids at some point get a fire debuff and
many wizards do the Staff of Flux quest which is another fire/cold debuff
(though minor, but it's free and every little bit helps).
