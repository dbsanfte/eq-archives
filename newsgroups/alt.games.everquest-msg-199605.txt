: 1st piece of advice...REMAP THE AUTO-ATTACK KEY.
:
: Before you do ANYTHING else in the game, REMAP THE AUTOATTACK KEY.
:
: now that you've remapped that autoattack key....(just go into Options
while
: ingame).  I have mine set to the Tilde (~) key.
<<< SNIPage>>>
: learn how to use the /loc command, because when you die, if you know your
: /loc, it's easier to find your corpse.

First of I have to say that was one of the best post I have seen on A.G.E..
Thank you for taking thispersons request and answering it in great detail.

Now on to the remaping AUTO attack.  I have to agree with someone else that
posted the Tilde (~) key may not be the best one for this.  It is normaly
either next tho the 1 key at the top( below the ESC key) or to the left of
the back slash key (\).   What I did was re map it to the Number Pad ENTER
key.  I also remaped Consider to the Number Pad 0 key.

Another thing i would do right of the bat is set up a sense direction / /Loc
macro and map it to one of your arrow keys
To set up the macro first you have to go to your Abilities tab.  Left click
in the top left squar and chose sence heading. Now go to the Macro tab.
click the lettle right arrow to go to the second page.  right click one of
the boxes to open the macro creator.  Name it Dir Loc (or any thing you
want) on the first line under the name type in:
 /doability 1
On the next line Type
/loc
now save this.  YOu will notice that the box now says DIR LOC. Right clcik
and hold untill you get a copy of the macro floating now place this in your
10'th  hot Key

Now to do the remaping
Hit  ALT+o  click the tab that says keyboard.  Select show all.  Loock for
the one that says AUTO ATTACK...  click on the a to the right of it, and
then click the key that you want to remap AA to.  ( you can map any action
to 2 diferent keys if you would like)  Now go to the one that says HOT KEY
10 ( if it lists 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 then you want 0)  click on the spot to
the right of 0 ( second map key colum) and click your Num Pad ENTER Key. (or
what you want to remap it to).  There is also one that says Consider I maped
the second map key to the NUM PAD 0 Key.

OK your remaping is done.  What you have remaped will be active on all your
characters, but you will have to create new macro's for each character.

: on your first character, learn to play and have fun.  when you get the
: basics down, if you want to pick up another character then do so.


For your first character create a Froglok.  Wariors are the easiest to learn
the game play.  Froglocks get a bonus in that the game will pop up a tool
tip ever step of the way the first couple of level's. (ie it tells you how
to use the shortcut kes, how to find your way around, how to start quests,
even what your basic quests are.)

: above all, HAVE FUN.


THis is the most important part.  When it stops being fun you wont want to
play it ever again.  If you start to get burned out take a week off.  Play
something else.

Now go out there and lay havic to the lands.
