The bread shortage is part of an ongoing storyline dealing with the
plague in Karanas.    Bread was removed from vendors as an
always-available item not too long after the plague began.   Another
quest was added, however, which requires delivery of bread loaves
to merchants:   that quest re-stocks the vendors with a limited
supply of bread whenever it is done.
