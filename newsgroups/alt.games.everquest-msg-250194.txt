True.  But they try to keep that to a minimum without a good, plot-driven

Yea, I was never much of a fan of that one, although I think that's 
largely because I was no good at it.  Pac Man, now, I wasn't all that bad 
at Pac Man. :)

Sure, they could.  I'd even think it would mostly be a good idea.  The 
only flaw I see with it is that then Bards would rule the world.  Oh wait, 
they already do. :)

I dunno, there's a tradeoff there.  Sure, it's pretty much a given that 
they -could- do it.  But for balance reasons, they might have to implement 
a one second delay or something, or the free attack you mention below.  So 
it's hard to say which is better... racing to use the cumbersome 
weapon-changing (and possibly deriving an advantage, however small, by 
being good at it) vs. convenience.  I think, in my world, either is ok, so 
I'll deal with the one that exists.

Tangents.  I doubt anyone is -honestly- umbrageous with you.  but there 
will always be tangents.  And such a joy they are!

One second?  That's like, practically forever!  That's a good quarter of a 
bard song casting time, and a whole delay cycle or more to some 
heavily-hasted types with fast weapons.  

I'd say maybe half that would provide reasonable balance.  People were 
jumping up and down about -instant-, not a whole second.  Get with the 
twitch-gaming program, here.  :)
