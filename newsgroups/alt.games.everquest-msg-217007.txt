We tried a group the other day as an experiment - 2 Mages, 1 Cleric, 3
Necros (all 65 except cleric 62). We ended up failing for the following
reasons. We choose MM primarily so there would be undead that the necro's
could mez and slow - but it turned out to be one of those MM dungeons where
there were more live mobs than undead, therefore most of the mobs couldn't
be slowed or mezzed. The cleric was very bad at keeping the pets healed and
so there were repeated pet deaths. It was messy with agro jumping around all
over the place. We were killing fast and furious but in the end we failed
after 2 necro's died and the cleric also bit the dust twice. We came pretty
close to winning and it was good fun.

We would have won if 1) There had been more undead as opposed live mobs for
necro's to mez and slow 2) We had Paladin / Shadow Knight as replacement to
one other class to hold the agro off the casters. The deaths occured because
no one particular person was holding the agro and it was leaping around -
mostly between the necro's. Couldn't quite understand how the cleric ending
up dieing twice though.
