People keep saying that. Yes, maybe the required number of xp points
is the same. That is rough, yes, but not quite as rough as it sounds.
One thing to remember, the amount of xp per kill at 58 is higher than
it was in, say, the 30's and 40's. The numbers make it look a whole
lot worse than it actually is.

Like I said, it's still pretty damn rough, though. Just not totally
grim...
