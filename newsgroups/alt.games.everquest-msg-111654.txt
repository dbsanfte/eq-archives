There are two approaches to making shissar easier to find. One is to
park a tracker alt in Fear at a "safe spot" (I can get you a loc if
needed) and track periodically. The safe spot isn't entirely safe but
is usually okay.

The second option is to sucker a guild druid into doing a Fear run.
The chanter and druid get runed and invised. They zone in and the
druid immediately tracks for shissar (and broken golem if anyone in
the guild needs it). Once tracking is complete the druid evacs out. If
anything aggros, the chanter chain stuns while the druid evacs. I've
done it a half-dozen times without any difficulty, though twice we've
had to do CRs for guildies who ran into trouble.
