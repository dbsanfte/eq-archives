I think I see where you are confused.  AAXP moves as fast as XP moved when
you were 51... but you still need to kill mobs appropriate to your level.
How quickly would your XP bar have moved if you'd killed four 39ish mobs at
51?

As a level 60, I went to the Hand/Warlord camp in Karnor's Castle and helped
kill mobs for a couple of hours to help a guildie with an epic drop.  I
barely got any AAXP there - whereas the same camp would have gotten me loads
of XP when I was 51.  However, if I got to Cazic-Thule and kill dark blue
mobs there, I can make AAXP hand over fist.

Also, Verant has slightly nerfed the XP you get from some dark blue cons,
having them give less XP than before.  You may need to kill more high-level
dark blue cons to see significant movement.

Keep at it.  You'll find a happy medium, and trust me... Run 3 is worth it.
