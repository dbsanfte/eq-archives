I spent a good day farming heart spider silks in return for a lvl 50+
Warrior knocking off the Shin Upper Guk frogs. He was also plat farming
as well.

We had one of the items drop, but  as I was only new to the place, it
timed out a few tics before I made it down to the Shin ?? Room in the
Barracks. (about 4 U turns involved)

Aargh, yer, what I kept noticing was the constant stream of high level
chr'ss going past the spiders and doing the big arc to get down to Lower
Guk. Well I assume they were going there as I saw none coming out and
the time they were in Upper Guk would have let them just get to Lower
Guk entrances.

This is really weird to me. I can travel through half a dozen almost
empty zones, then ping, hit a zone with 1-2doz high levels camping
something or doing a quest. Although I have noted that a lot of the
guides make similar claims for certain zones and nowadays they are
almost empty at peak times.


Anyway, I guess travelling is one of those things that you get used to
as you gain levels (most stuff leaves you alone anyway). As a newbie low
level, you tend to play stuff close to your chest, but as a higher
level, I'm interested in poking around a bit.
