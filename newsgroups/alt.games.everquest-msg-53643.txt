 No no no.... I've been on a few raids that depended on the services
of a Rogue (disarming traps, picking locks), er.. oh and then there's
the many times we've needed a Mage to CoH.. oh wait... I've needed a 
Rez or LoH more than a few times from a Paladin...... Hmmmm and I've 
also sat for long periods of time at a camp just for a Warrior to to 
show up so we could actually start pulling... 
 
 Hmmm Shadow Knights... Hmmmm, I guess it's ok to piss them off.   8^)
