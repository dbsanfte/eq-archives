Most likely a duplicate. A quick petition should take care of that.

They removed this more than a year ago. Alignment (based on
race/class/diety) now works like any other server (expect maybe the
Zeks, I don't know their rule sets)

This was changed more than a year ago as well. You can now master any
language at any level. You don't have to zone to check the progress
either. Languages now skill up and report their current level...ie
"You have increased your skill in Dark Elven (23)!"

>Anyone know what happened to alignment...did I just miss it?

Yup you missed it :-)
