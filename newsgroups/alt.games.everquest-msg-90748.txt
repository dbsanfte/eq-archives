 I don't exactly hate the change. Sure, it makes some pulls a little
more annoying but that's about it. I've found non-aggro eyes to be a
very good tool as well for scouting before the pull. I'm thinking the
next nerf to Eye will be that it goes back to being aggo but that it
doesn't pass it along to the owner. At that point I'd probably consider
getting rid of them but for now they are still useful to me.
