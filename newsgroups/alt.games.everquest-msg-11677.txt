No, you don't understand ... *I* did it. I did. No you. You had nothing to
do with it. In fact, I know where you got the idea from, and it was from me.
*ME*

And as far as vain goes, I have no idea what you mean. I never tell people

Agreed. Quests like these are not lame not only because they don't involve
