There are game cards available, look anywhere that advertises EQ for sale.

you probably got scammed fella.  EQ keys are non transferable in any 
way.  If the CD was open, the key was used and all you have is an 
attractive coaster.  No way to check until you sign in for the first 
time.  Do us all a favor, if you aren't gonna use that CD, throw it out, 
don't try to re-sell it.

if you had a credit card, they are very good at not charging you until 
after the 30 days are up.  There are one month game cards, or there used 
to be one month cards, I know I've bought one.

Your machine, I'm not sure about, AFAIK EQ is only playable on windows 
machines.
