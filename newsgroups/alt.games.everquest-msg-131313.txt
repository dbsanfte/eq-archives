Bandits are between 9th and 13th I believe, they stop aggro'ing at 22. The
exception is the brigand's (uncommon/random spawn instead of a bandit) these
are 15-17 and WILL aggro anything, if you see one (will look like a
Barbarian in chain armour, all the others wear leather) kill him first, the
others won't join in. The half elves are druids will nuke, root and DS but
dop quickly, the female Half Elves were the only ones that healed, not sure
if this was addressed in the caster AI patch.
As I said, the loot table is a little screwed (IMO) so only human bandits
(and their Farmer friends) or brigands will drop sashes.

You'll be Threatening to the Guards of Qeynos (covers Karana) to start and
Scowls with Paladin and Cleric guilds. Once you have slaughtered as many
Gnolls as possible (I recon 6hrs total in BB killing will surfice for
dubious, the Gnoll teeth you've collected should take you to Apprehensive)
the Knights of Thunder and Priests of Life are a little tougher, the follow
up to the Gnoll Teeth quest is the moonstone one and it's faction hits are
not great. I'd suggest, once you are no longer KoS to the rest of Qeynos
move on to the Bandits and collect as many Sashes as you can then see if you
can get a Wolf Form while in Sth Qeynos to hand them in (the sashes provide
large faction hits to Paladins and Priests of life, I recon 2 back packs, 16
sashes, would take you from Threatening to Dubious.
