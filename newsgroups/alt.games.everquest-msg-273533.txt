WoW isnt released yet in Europe.  :)
And AB always had a lower population than SolRo,maximum of traders
I saw on AB was 350,when they raised the cap to 550.I think the Euro
servers will be unplayable after release of WoW in Europe,maybe if you
like soloing. :)
And all this talk about returning players from WoW or EQ2 is crap
IMHO,traders on SolRo mostly under 200.

Meldur (waiting for european release of WoW)
