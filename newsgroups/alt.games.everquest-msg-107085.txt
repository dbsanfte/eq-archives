? entropia? Nah, they just let you buy virtual items. They really
don't need lawyers for that but rather just a way to keep track of the
transactions very well. Since the items are virtual, if they get lost
in a crash or something the company just goes, "oh ok, we checked your
char file and here they are back." since its at zero cost to them.

I just think no one will find that type of game fun or challenging.
Maybe someone would buy a rare item they could never get in EQ, like a
lodizal shield, but for the most part they got the rest of what they
have and built the character. When all upgrades are just dependant
upon the cash you have, what is the challenge of play? Its kind of
like I play Dungeon Siege, a new rpg that some people don't like. I
love it and would never "cheat" with a character builder or item
maker, that is just not fun. Meanwhile I have a friend who always does
that with every game and I laugh at them. What is the point?
