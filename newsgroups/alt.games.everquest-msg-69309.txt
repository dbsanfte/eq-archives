I do that too, mostly, except for the first two full pages.  The first
full page has my normal set of 8 spells that I use for typical solo
killing of single mobs, plus alternates for a couple of the spells,
arranged in the order I have them memorized.

This makes it easy to remem after death, or after swapping out some
spells for special purposes.

The second full page has various buffs and effects, such as my shield
spell, the damage absorb spells, invis, see invis, lev, etc.

The rest of the book is then organized by category.

I also have a bank of hotkeys to go to particular categories.  So, if
I need to mem a port, I just hit shift-2 to go to that bank of
hotkeys, and then hit my "port" hotkey, which does "/book 12".
