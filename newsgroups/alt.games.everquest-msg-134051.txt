I can think of three useful applications:

1.  The new user interface can have so many windows
on the screen that at times it might be more useful
to simulate the "original", non-fullscreen mode
(i.e., small "action window", surrounded by a lot
of buttons and menus), rather than have a lot of
the "world view" partially obscured under overlapped
status windows and such.

(Note that in the new UI, you can't just hit F10
a few times to get the classic "nonfullscreen" view.
If you want something like that, you'll have to
"roll your own" with /viewport.)

2.  There are times when a complex zone (e.g.
any Luclin city, or any Kunark forest) brings
framerate to a crawl.  Shrinking the viewport
does wonders for framerate at times like that.
I used to use F10 to switch to "nonfullscreen" view
(with its tiny viewport) when running through
Kunark forests (BW, WW, etc.) so that I could
actually travel at something approaching my
full run speed.  Now under the new UI I'll
just set up a pair of hotkeys, one which shrinks
the viewport to a small corner of the screen,
and the other which blows it back up to full
screen again.

Come to think of it, the same thing may help a
lot on raids where you've got 40-60 people and
all their armor/weapon models to render.

3.  Finally, people can now design their own "skins"
(custom windows) for the new UI, and the /viewport
command will let them design some screen layouts
that previously would have been impossible.
Like, for example, using most of the middle
of the screen for the "worldview", but leaving
an inch of empty margin around the edges, which
are tiled with "toolbars" and narrow status
windows of various types.
