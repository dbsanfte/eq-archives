You didn't get teleported. You DIED and were sent to your default bind
point. It's not a bad idea... until you start losing experience when you
die. Even then, I've seen some situations where dying is used as a TL
(Translocation) to your bind point, but usually it's done by dueling PCs,
since you don't lose experience.
