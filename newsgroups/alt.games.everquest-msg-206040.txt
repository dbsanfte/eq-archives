I've seen Puller as MA a number of times where adds were common, the
raid had plenty of CC, and the MT was inexperienced at picking targets
but had excellent hate generation and could be relied on to grab agro
even with everybody else already on the mob (i.e. Paladin or SK).  Also
seen Puller call the target for the MT (again with adds) and everybody
except CC people required to hold off doing anything until MT called
the assist.
