The question was, what's the difference "from a practical standpoint?"
From the standpoint of the players, in particular, it makes no difference
if the code is broken or the quest is poorly designed, especially if SOE
never fixes broken code and never redesigns overly obscure clues.  In
either case, it is effectively impossible for a player to complete the
quest.

As for which ones "are big enough a deal", well, that's hard to know,
because if the quest is never solved there's no way to know how important
it is.  I suppose if the quest is obviously important, SOE might fix it,
but not necessarily.  (Have they fixed the bug in the Berserker Epic that
got mentioned in this thread?)

The real problem is that, because so many quests are either broken or
(apparently) too hard to solve, it may make some players less interested
in attempting to solve quests at all.  This is compounded by the fact
that many quest NPCs are happy to hand out quests that are inappropriate
due to level, race, or class.  E.g., I've noticed some NPCs on the boat
in Abysmal Sea who seem to be offering quests that aren't listed on
Allakhazam, and I might consider trying to solve them, but I don't know
if I can do so without adventuring in other GoD zones (which I'm nowhere
near capable of) nor whether the reward would be anything I'd want.  The
fact that the quests might also be broken, or too obscure to figure out,
is just one more obstacle to my enthusiasm.
