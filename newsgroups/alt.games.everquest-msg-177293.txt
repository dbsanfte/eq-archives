I've been playing eq on Windows 2000 since the day 2000 was released, I
never reboot my system, I play EQ when I want to, I do not get any errors.
Windows Me has a very poor reputation in general, I would never even
consider it.  Windows 98 is a good OS for playing EQ.  Windows XP seems to
have a lot of issues, some people have no trouble with it, many people have
all sorts of problems with it.  I have several friends that made the mistake
of Me or XP, and have since gone to 2000, and are extremely pleased with
their choice.
