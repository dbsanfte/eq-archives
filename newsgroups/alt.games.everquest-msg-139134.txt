Its faster, but the time you save is generally less than the time to swap
and cast spells. I used to use it in the days before we had a surefall port.
If it didnt come down when something casts a spell on you, it might be
usefull to cross some zones when your sow is still slow (DL or TT at 34 for
example), but in its current form it is useless.
