  Yes, they do.  However, some of the spiders do see 
through invis and camo.  I've only recently learned that 
they all don't.  Whew!

Hmm...not a bad idea.  My shaman I'd keep bound to the bank
in FV, however.  It's simply too easy to resist gating back
there to take care of the book keeping.  My ranger, OTOH,
doesn't have gate, and is the main character I'm playing
now...so...hmmm.  Thanks for the suggestion.

Annie <-- Never been killed by FV spiders, but is still
          scared of them.
