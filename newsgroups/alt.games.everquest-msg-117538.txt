Folly is not my fault ! one of the reasons I think all clerics are idiots
though. P.s . I already gave you a clue last week when I mentioned that
meadbh looted the heart from the ragefire I pulled :) If you still dont know
ask diasi who is chanter/druid/monk friend is :p

Incidently I play late at night since I am generally working in the
afternoon and evening. I dont generally mention my guild because all uber
guilds are hated and frankly I jsut dont want to hear about it, but since I
know who you are ill give ya a clue :)
