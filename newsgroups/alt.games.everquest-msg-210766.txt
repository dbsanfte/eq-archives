10 in strength and 10 in agility and 5 in stamina...hmmm...Maybe I didn't
emphasise how important Stamina is when I rambled on about encumbrance.
Oh, tbh, it doesn't make a lot of difference but it is commonly believed you
melee attack speed slows down when the yellow stamina bar runs out, unless
you have 100 or over in stamina.
Of course you are playing a DE Warrior so must be making it for RP purposes
rather than number crunching it. Besides,  I stuck 15 points in Agility and
5 in strength and stamina, the only thing that ever slowed my progress was
my play style and time restraints.
