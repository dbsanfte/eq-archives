ROFL, you don't read my posts much do you?  I have a 44 druid, and I love
dungeons because they take a higher level of intelligence to stay the hell
alive in than all the fucktards that go from 1-50 in the oasis/ LoIO/ OT/ DL
loop and then try to play in a dungeon and get half the zone killed making
regular trains.

If you want to complain about druids being nerfed, complain about such
shitty Luclin spells as Moonfire or Tangling Weeds, and such innovative and
sweeping changes as "Your target is immune to changes in movement speed".

Please explain to me how clerics are downgraded from the endgame because
druids can solo 1-60?

We can't use ONE LINE of our AoEs indoors, the lightning strike line, which
you'd have to be a moron to try and use in an aoe group since it only hits 4
things, whereas our rain line works fine (but is also not suitable for aoe
groups) and our Earthquake line PBAoE which is what we use for most AoE
groups because it can hit an unlimited number of targets (within range).

Also, 95% of people play 1-60 without ever even joining an AoE group (mostly
because they cant AoE)
