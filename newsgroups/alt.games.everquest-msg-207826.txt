Yes indeed, they are tedious, boring long camps.  But compare them to 
other long camps in the game and look at the words "insanely rare".  
They are just ordinary rare.  Took me roughly 14 hours straight for 
Bergurgle and Grim each, plus more hours on Bergurgle in short camps.  
Since then I've killed Bergurgle three times for other clerics by the 
simple expedient of  checking track whenever my bard passed thru LRathe, 
and on spotting him up, going thru my cleric buddy list till I found one 
online that didn't have him yet.

But it was exp camping.  Not the best exp in the game, but at least it 
wasn't killing blues.  And yes, its ugly and tedious... but you can't 
describe it as "insanely rare spawns" when there are 20 more mobs in 
range of your Retribution at any given time!

Oh me either, I soloed for one of my drops, got another in a group, and 
the other two from people /ooc ing the zone when one dropped while they 
were exping.  See, before POP release, SF was a part of the infamous 
"outdoor to 60" route.

But 175 people was shortly after the change to the cleric epic from the 
one insanely rare mob on the list; Ragefire used to randomly pop 
anywhere from 3 to 5 days after server reset, and either be camped by 
dozens of eager clerics and their guilds, or you'd be on a list 
literally 8 months long to get him depending on your server.  When they 
changed it, a backlog of dozens and dozens of clerics who were 
completely ready for Ragefire came in with their buddies, plus other 
clerics who had sworn they were never going to bother getting epic the 
wait list was so long or competition so ugly, were all there for several 
weeks killing for shards.  Since there are enourmous numbers of mobs in 
SF, the only problem with having 175 people there was that the lag got 
pretty thick for a lot of us...

As for rarity of drop, even with 175 people there killing (and killing 
fast, a lot of those people were level 60)  we still didn't see people 
killing Ragefire every 20 minutes, which is the cycle time on the warder.

Bergh Brelltender, 65 epic cleric
Llyric, 57 no epic Bard (need white scale, Trakanon, plus Eldrig the old)
Paax, 51 no epic Shaman (two mobs to go, probably both killable single 
group)
Matte, 30 chanter (there's a chanter epic?  Maybe I should look that up)
