Oh, once in a while I actually do post things other than newspaper
article links, like asking questions or offering my (admittedly
limited) knowledge of EQ when a newbie asks for advice.  But I admit
that lately I have indeed been mainly posting article links, mainly
because I don't have anything interesting to post here!  :P  I'd love
to be able to post fascinating stories like Monual/Richard Lawson, but
frankly my (also admittedly limited) EQ playing sessions tend to be
really boring, and I don't think the NG would be too interested in
hearing about my logging in for 30 minutes, killing a few mobs and
then logging out!
