Depends on your group.  You can solo Cobalt Scar wyverns and the chest (and the
cobalt drakes too) which should still be dark blue.  Should be able to solo
undeads in the Grey.  Probably the ones in ME too, although single pulling them
can be irritating.  I cna't recall the level range, there's a bunch of undead
near the spires in DL that are great for clerics of the right level.  Lots of
exp giving mobs you can solo... but whether you can do so faster than you would
with a complementary partner is less likely.

Cleric + almost any class tends to kill more than twice as many mobs per hour as
solo cleric... and as long as you kill at least twice as many per hour you break
even.

Question is, will the other class also find they are killing more than twice as
many per hour with your help?  This depends on the other class and the targets
and strategies you choose.

I really couldn't double a druid's kills per hour when she was quadding, even
after I figured out how to use PBAOE by standing in the drag path and  using
careful timing.  Well actually I was able to up her kills per hour by a factor
of five... when we did green mobs.  But on legitimately dangerous dark blues, at
best I could help her kill half again as many as she could solo; a great deal
for me, but a cut to 75% of her solo exp rate for her.

A warrior or monk, on the other hand, could benefit much more substantially from
my help.  That ranger I mentioned earlier; the two of us combined into a
-massively- more efficient killing team.  Of course the ranger could have been
killing animals, which would have made me a good deal less useful...
