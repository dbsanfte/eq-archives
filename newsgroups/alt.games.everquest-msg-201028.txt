Yeah, I think so as storage. In EQ2 Banks are not centralized, so the
freeport bank will be only the freeport bank while Qeynos bank is only
qeynos. So if you can have many more slots in a house, it will be a
"central" location for storage for someone. Tradeskillers would
especially do this if it was possible.

At least that is what I'm hoping. I hope they don't bother to put it
in and then blow it like Anarchy Online did. In AO it is virtual,
which is fine, and exists according to your keycard you get when you
make the character. The problem with the apartments are mainly:

1) You can't bring someone else to your apartment. This kind of makes
it moot. Originally we thought maybe you copy your key for them in the
way you can for missions, letting them come with you and hang out. Or
perhaps they could if grouped. No such luck on either account.

2) The apartment only holds 10 objects. So it is not even useful for
storage, or that great for decorating. When I was first playing I
stuck some things in my apartment and went there, at that time I still
thought it would gain a better use. That doesn't seem to be happening,
nor is it in the works. (the extension the Shadowlands adds apartments
in Jobe if you pre-order or something, but will the be any better?) 

The sad thing is you get stuff for apartments sometimes in missions
but due to the fact that apartments suck and can only hold 10 items,
people mostly always just sell them.

AO is weird because it took a fantastic idea, virtual space for an
apartment so even if you had 20,000 players you'd never run out of
room in a city, and totally wasted it.
