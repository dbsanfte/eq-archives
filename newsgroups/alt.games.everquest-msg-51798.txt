I just started a new cleric character in Felwithe (High Elf) and I can't
seem to find divine aura anywhere.  I thought that I checked all the venders
carefully but I can't locate it.  Is there a trick or am I a bit dense.  I
have played a warrior before but I am new to the game and any cleric advice
would be awesome.  Thanks ( korinth on luclin)
