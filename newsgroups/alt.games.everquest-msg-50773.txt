This already exists, and is not subject to abuse by players. It just
exists in  reverse.  There is a value that the vendor will buy the
item for. THAT is your minimum sell price in /Auction.

Agreed, this is abyssmaly low in some cases, but you've not found the
solution. If you  make the vendors pay 1/2 the current /auc price
(aside from the difficulties of linking the merchants items with the
text in actions), then you'll have folks spamming "/auc rusty short
sword 32000 PP"  so that they can sell thier sword for 16k PP..
