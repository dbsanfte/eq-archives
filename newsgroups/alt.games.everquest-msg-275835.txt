Other people have replied with descriptions of that spell, so I'll
just add a couple new points:

Your book only shows spells you yourself know how to cast, so you
won't find it there.

There are few if any spells that other players can cast on you that
cause you any harm.  Sure, floating *could* cause problems (someone
else mentioned not knowing how to get back down to ground level to
be able to attack things), and even a healing spell could be "bad"
if you were trying to practice your Bind Wound skill, but as for
actual harmful effects, you're mostly safe as long as you don't
accept a duel or go to an arena (where PvP is allowed even on non-
PvP servers).

There may be a few rare exceptions, such as spells that boost your
STR for a while but leave you temporarily weaker when the spell wears
off.  (I don't know if that can be cast on someone outside your group.
Someone once did it within my group to help our looter run back, but
the spell wore off too soon and the looter became unable to move, and
got clobbered.)
