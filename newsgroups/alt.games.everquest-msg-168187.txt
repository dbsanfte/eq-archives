    SOE took Monkly Business off their list of links on the EQLive site.
Given how far downhill the quality of discussion has gone there since the
big nerfs, I'm surprised people still go there.

    Last year, MB paid $5000 to EZBoard according to the MB admin that's in
our guild. It seems nuts, doesn't it?

    Yantis has been OK. It's the regular admins that are going nuts in an
effort to finally clean up the place. MB has become an open sewer, filled
with whining and personal attacks a-plenty on anyone and everyone. The
admins are trying to restore order and player credibility to the place. The
only thing I've seen that could be over-the-top is the locking of any thread
that rehashes old points from the pro-or-con Yantis debate, supposedly
because it's beating a dead horse.
