The conventional wisdom is misleading, though there is some truth in
it. It really depends on the ratio, and the level of the wielder. The
level damage bonus makes a huge difference at higher levels. For
instance, if I had a pair of Lamentations (9 19), and a Wurmslayer (25
40), which should I wield primary? At my level, 39, the Wurm/Lammy is
the best combo, doing 696 DPM, vs 646 for a Lammy/Lammy combo.
However, at level 60, the numbers are 992 for the Lammy/Lammy, and 938
for the Wurm/Lammy.

You just can't make a blanket statement like the fastest weapon always
going in the primary slot. In general, faster weapons should go
primary, but even this is only true after level 25 when level bonuses
kick in. Prior to that, best ratio should always be primary, and even
afterwards in many cases.

It gets tricky trying to compare an 8 22 weapon with a 10 25 weapon.
The 8 22 has a 7.73 ratio, while the 10 25 has a much better sounding
8.4 ratio. From level 40 onwards the 8 22 is the better weapon, while
prior to that the 10 25 is better. Yet meet a level 25 warrior with
these two weapon and you'll almost always see the 8 22 primary, so the
character does less damage than he's capable of.

As others have already pointed out, Copeland's weapon analyzer is an
excellent tool, it even takes into account the extra damage of weapon
procs, so you can accurately compare a Short Sword of Ykesha (8 24,
procs 75 pt DD), and a Scale Hide Whip (8 22, no proc). It calculates
based on Class, Level and Strength, Haste items (if any), primary hand
and off hand.
