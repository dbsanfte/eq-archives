	I agree, insofar as exploring terrain or the layout of a
dungeon is concerned.

	It's some of the other bits I find tedious and boring.
Particularly questing which involves finding NPCs that may not always
be present.  I'd much rather head to the websites and find out exactly
when and where certain NPCs spawn and save myself the frustration of
trying to find him/her/it via random chance.

	But we are.  I mean, realistically, is there any qualitative
difference between having a fellow Warrior in-game give you a
step-by-step walkthrough of how to do the Fire and Ice Epic quest, and
going to Allakhazam and getting a step-by-step walkthrough of the Fire
and Ice Epic quest?  The information on Allakhazam's was gathered by
my fellow EQ players, and was shared with my fellow EQ players.
