I took years off, too, leaving well before the Kunark expansion and just
returning this last December. In that time my wife and I have built new
characters (Shaman and Warrior) to level 30-31 and are having a *great*
time. It's a hugely better game now with more of just about everything that
made it good improved, and much of what made it frustrating either
eliminated or diminished. I left the game in frustration then and never
thought I'd go back to it, but I'm happy to say that I'm enjoying it even
more than I thought I would. If you liked it then, you'll like it a lot more
now.

Do what my wife and I did, start new characters on Firiona Vie. This
RP-preferred server allows only one character so there are no alts, just
mains, which theoretically means fewer twinks. I don't have a lot of
experience on the other servers but my perception is that the gameplay here
is pretty pure and simple. There's less farming of items (Trivial Loot Code)
and in general a pretty good emphasis on enjoying the game as it was
intended.

I had the same concerns you did about starting off and not having anyone
around to group with. Non-issue. Although it's true that there are a LOT of
high levels around now, the popularity of this game (and of the FV server),
as well as the recent release of EQ Gold, assures a constant influx of new
players that you can group with. I spent part of last night sitting outside
the Nexus portal showing a level 3 Bard around, recalling fondly how not too
long ago I was in his situation. I have had no trouble at any time finding
groups at my range and I suspect that the Bard won't, either.

I've played almost all of them seriously, they all have their points.
Anarchy Online was probably my favorite altnerative, but it's sci-fi so that
doesn't meet your fantasy criteria. Dark Ages of Camelot offered the best
combat skill and PvP options I've ever experienced, but the world is still
new and content remains an issue, particularly when compared to a world as
rich and well-developed as EverQuest. Ultimately there just wasn't enough to
do to keep me interested once I reached my peak in that game. There is a new
expansion out now that adds quite a bit, so it might be worth looking into
again. Forget Asheron's Call 2, I think it's got a flawed model that will
fail to gel. No NPCs, very little content, gorgeous engine, I think it was
designed with the goal of making it easy for anyone to start playing without
suffering any consequences.

Ultimately, EQ is still the deepest, most richly-developed and rewarding
experience in the MMORPG space that I'm aware of. Come back on and give it a
try. If you liked it before, you will probably like it a whole lot more now.
My experience was that I sort of liked it before, with major reservations
and frustrations, but I love it now!

By the way, if you do decide to get back to EQ, buy the EQ Gold package.
Comes with everything you need in one box, all expansions all neatly
installed into one directly and nicely integrated with one account key. Nice
packaging, and a few goodies inside, it's well worth the $40 you can find it
for.
