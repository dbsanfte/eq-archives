  Well, nobody is obligated to help a stranger.  Though it's nice if they
do, I try not to assume they are rude idiots if they refuse or ignore me...
maybe they're in /tell hell, busy negotiating some deal (if they're at the
EC tunnel), maybe they're AFK, who knows.

  I always would SoW people who asked politely (and usually would SoW people
without their asking me if I didn't have anything else to do), and I think
it's nice if people do the same, but I also appreciate it if people accept
my refusual to help them without presuming I'm some sort of terrible, rude
person.

  Eh, SoW is a luxury.  After playing a SoWing druid for a while, it may
feel really excruitating to run around without it, but if you play smart
it's not necessary to survive most zones.  With my shadow knight, I think I
only asked for SoW two or three times before getting my J. Boots.

  There are better reasons to be embarassed about being a druid. ;)

  Beware, SoWs will not come easily on FV, at least not in my experience.
That's the server I'm playing my knight on and part of the reason I never
asked for a SoW is because I didn't often run into people who could cast it,
when I was about to travel somewhere.
