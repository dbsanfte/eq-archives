Aha, they fooled you.

Coke was a sugar based beverage.  Turns out thats a relatively
expensive way to make a soda for some reason.

So they made New Coke, a fructose based beverage, and stopped
making original Coke completely.  Weathered out the outrage
while people drank up the old supplies so there would be nothing
to compare with, then came out with Classic Coke... less sweet
than New Coke, but fructose based and sweeter than original
Coke.

You actually believed that "Classic" was the old formula, but that
your tastes were altered during the interim so that what once
made you happy was now "too sweet"

But really "Classic" is too damn sweet... and if they'd had original
on the shelves when they came out with Classic you'd have known
it right off the bat!
