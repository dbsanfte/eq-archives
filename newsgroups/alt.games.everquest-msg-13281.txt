I'm glad you asked :-)

On Xev, there is the Povar-Tarew Artisans (formerly the Povar Tradeskills
Association, it moved from the Povar server when Xev was opened up.) Our charter
states:

"The PTA strives to become the standard for tradescraft merchants on Xev, the
pricing standard by which others deal, and the prime source for all items,
skilled and basic, that can be made via tradescraft."

Our full charter and other information can be found at http://www.povarpta.org
