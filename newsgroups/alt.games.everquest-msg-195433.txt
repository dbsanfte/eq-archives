Not using James' own definition 'the spell must give mana regen that
increases meditation rate'.  That spell does nothing of the sort, it dumps
300 mana (max) into your mana pool, which you can use instantly and then
you're back to being oom again, you won't get any faster regen over the
next 10 minutes.

Yes it's a good spell, I love it, I use it all the time, but I was pointing
out that James wasn't using his own definition.
