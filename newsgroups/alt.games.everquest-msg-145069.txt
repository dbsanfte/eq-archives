And if that kind of generalisation type 'seen one, know them all'
attitude is indicative of your membership, it's no wonder. :-p

Just because one or two, fairly loud uberguilds happen to have
spokespeople who tend to swear a lot and make juvenile news reports to
'entertain' the masses flocking to nose around their actions, doesn't
mean all are painted with the same brush.

Still, it's good the know Abraham Lincoln did his best work with an
intern's lips clasped around his manhood, whilst starting in a movie
with a monkey on his peanut farm );o)
