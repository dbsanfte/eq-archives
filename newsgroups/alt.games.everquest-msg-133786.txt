Jim Monk, 9:56am is both the first responder I see and the first to

It is all about setting boundaries before you start groping.
Talk openly with your partner before you begin groping
Like you say what is green to him could be red to you.

There are others, I'd guess that:  your newsfeed is letting you down,

is from Jazz, so KF seems unlikely), or your newsreader screwed up the

Anyhow, the comments you expect are there.
