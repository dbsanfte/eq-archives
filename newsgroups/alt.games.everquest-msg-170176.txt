I'm the Map God of the guild.  I always have the current map, Allah's, and 
Illia's up on a zone we're in.

Rugs = pits?  Or Rugs = Mobs?

That will be my job and I'll be heading up the expedition, so we got that 
covered.  Thanks.

Great point.  I know one of the Pally's has one.  I need to push that the 
others get them.

Thanks for the info, Dan and all the others who posted info in the thread.
