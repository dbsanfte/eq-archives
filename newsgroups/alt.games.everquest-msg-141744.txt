12 weeks!  I'm almost a full orange bubble into 54 and I haven't been
54 a week yet.  And that's NOT powerleveling.  Only thing I've been
killing is Allizewsaur in OOT, and only doing that maybe 3 or 4 hours
a night.

I will concede that he seems to give pretty good exp (about 6 or 8
Alli's to one blue bub), but it doesn't seem like 54 is all that much
worse than 53.
