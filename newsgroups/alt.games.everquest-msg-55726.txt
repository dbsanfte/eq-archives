Let me clarify some of my opinions, I admit I made this post hastily and
without much thought and I apologize for this totally.

I feel that sometimes the GM events were the only time VI has encouraged
Role-Playing...
Yes I really do enjoy reading the how shall I say this "pre history"? Like
on the Luclin Site it gives information about Al Whatever and things like
that, I enjoy reading....

In game I have met very few people that actually role-play.
In game I felt this was really the only time that other people were actually
exposed to role-playing and I feel that the events repeating, and repeating
kind of defeats RPing during those events...

Ah well I guess I will have to live with this.
