Wow.  Questions:

1. Are you using SIMMs or DIMMs?
2. Do you know how "fast" your board can handle, memory bus speed wise?  If
your board can only do PC100, and your RAM is PC133 (and sometimes vice
versa), that can cause a problem. . .
3. Also, some chipsets are picky about matching DIMMs, just like older
boards only really liked using matching pairs of SIMMs.  Are your two memory
stix significantly different from one another?
4. Did you test your memory with something like DocMemory to see if it's
just that particular module?
