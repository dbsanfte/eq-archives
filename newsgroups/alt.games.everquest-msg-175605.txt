I'm having trouble doing any kind of /join to a chat channel. Some times
I'll get connected and then suddenly stop seeing any response to my input or
other incoming chat messages, but most of the time I can't even /join. I
type /join channel (or whatever) and nothing happens. No response, no text,
no error message, no usage, nothing. It's been very limiting. When I was
interviewing for my current guild, they tried to get me into a chat channel
to get to know me a little better and it was embarassing that I could not
even join chat!

I suspect this may be a firewall issue. The chat servers are reputed to be
on a separate system than the game servers, and I thought at first that it
might be possible that the incoming packets come in through a different port
than the game's UDP packets and that my firewall is blocking them. But this
raises the question of why it *sometimes* works for a few seconds before
quitting (rarely, but it has happened). It would seem that if it's a
firewall issue, the packets wouldn't get in at all.

But I'm at a complete loss at what could be causing this problem. Anyone
have any additional ideas? Meanwhile, to test the firewall theory, does
anyone know the port ranges that need to be supported for chat channel
support? On the official support boards I haven't seen any specific
reference to firewall port ranges in connection with CHAT, just the game
itself (which has never been an issue for me).

Thanks in advance for any ideas or thoughts here!

Bob (next stop is to post this on the ShowEQ boards)
