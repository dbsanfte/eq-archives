What he said... I've done my share of quadding, for fun, but the best xp 
I've ever got has been by using charm (which I learned awfully late in 
my career). Failing that, my favourite hunting method has been root/
rotting, which allowed me to read and post in this ng at the same time.

At any rate, the gist of of my post is that, while the healing situation 
can be pretty dire during the spell gaps, Druids are more able than most 
other classes to bridge those gaps by soloing.
