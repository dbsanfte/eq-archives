I'd say shaman, as I'm always taking a shaman over a druid for normal
exp grouping (unles syou *really* need harmony). It also depends on level.
After lvl 29, a Shaman gets extremely versatile. The abilities spread out
then:

SK:	Can snare and (if wanted) fear
Cleric:	Does the obious healing and HP buffing
Shaman:	Slows enemies, buffs the SK mad, can haste the SK, can debuff the mob,
	can nuke, can dot, can emergency heal, can SoW and so on

IMHO, the slowing of mobs and hasting your melees of the SK in addition with
the combat stat buffs are really making this a very easy choice. It only
gets less obvious, if you have a chanter around (speed and also able to slow)
etc. But in this triplet or any small group, a shaman shines (and will be
stressed .. get ready for your shaman having a fit :) ).
