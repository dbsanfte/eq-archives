If I had half a mind I would write this...

As a Total and Permanently 100% Disabled Service Connected Veteran. I find
that the time I spend RUNNING around in this EQ world not enough.
For some people it is a freedom of movement not otherwise enjoyed elsewhere.

It takes time just to type this.  Some people not knowing of my problems
tell me that I don't say much. Sometimes they might find me as not social
for not typing. Or that I misspell words and complain about my punctuation.
It is not easy sometime to use more then a optical trackmarble. It takes
TIME.

It is easy to be dumped from groups over the time it takes to react AND
type.

Please don't try to put a time limit on some of the only world some people
might have left to get around in.



P.S. Since I have wrote this, You might have guessed I only have half a
mind.

P.P.S  I THINK that a time limit is a bad idea.
