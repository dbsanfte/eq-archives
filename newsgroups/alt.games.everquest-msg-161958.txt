To me the reason monks as soloers were attractive was because of time. I
could stop, do some work, answer phones, then un feign and go back to
adventuring. You can't do that with a group; if you have to deal with
problems in your household your groupmates will die, and I don't understand
how other people don't find that their families etcetera make demands upon
them and are able to commit 4 or 5 hours at a stretch.

I would have liked to reach 60, and get my epic, and a few other things, but
I guess i have to face the fact that sony doesn't want everquest to be
played in the way I've enjoyed playing it, and it's starting to remind me of
those company team building exercises that make everyone hate each other.

Anyway, here's Bodi's viewpoint.

/bowing Out
Submitted by Bodi on 11/11/2002 2:38:40 PM


  Where to start?

  Well, I started to write this out roughly on the tube on the way home so I
could just type it all out, and edit it later, but its hard where to know
where to start. Plagerism works well I think at a time like this, so I will
repost some of what I posted to my guild board at lunchtime.

  I am leaving EQ.

  I am NOT cancelling my account yet, and there are a last few goals that I
would like to achieve (completing the 9th ring, hitting 60) but thats it
folks.

  Why? Unfortunatly, I have discovered that hitting high levels and raiding
actually does require lots and lots of time. Like Duh! Obvious really, but I
have JUST started to notice it. The fact that I have only just realised
means that my attention has finally been diverted elsewhere, the spell is
broken, and other commitments (family natch) are taking over.

  My playstyle (time whatever) is limited, and I cannot commit the time now
to play for 3 or 4 hrs in an uninterupted block once, twice or three times a
night (or even at weekends). Soloing is a complete pile of wank and boring,
and I cant group as I may have to log off 3 minutes after starting or
joining one.

  Raiding is supurb, and I would love to do it, but again it boils back to
time available, of which I do have every now and then, but mostly in a quite
spectacular fashion does not coincide with everyone else.

  Planes of Power stories have been floating around this weekend (I have
been away on a Tequila fueled trip to Leicester, which is actually not in
Wales! - Sorry, stupid London humour), and they sound quality, but its more
of the same, timesink key/flag this and that, and I dont want to waste a
whole groups time getting me flagged in the executioner trail for me to then
not log on for a week or more.

  My friends and Guildees have suggested all of the usual things, play
another character, try another server (PVP or FV)...but to me, Everquest IS
Bodi, and my home is Bristlebane. I cannot even qualify as a guide as my
'secondary' is not above 10th level because I didnt wnat to play anyone
else.

  As mentioned above, soloing is a chore (well, I didnt actually say that,
but you know what I mean), and all my friends know that I can never stay in
one place at a time for too long before getting itchy feet, so its not a
change of scenery I need either. Quests? I have done the ones that I am
interested in, and done all the Monk ones bar the Iksar due to the massive
faction issues, and with no way to shortcut this....I ramble.

  The completetion of the 9th Ring will be done by me, as barring the Monk
Epic is THE best quest I fear, and it would be a crimainal act not to follow
it through to one of its ends.

  I also will NOT be leaving these message boards anytime soon. I have
spoken to Zad, and the other Mods, and they still want me to stay, so as
long as that is ok with you, I will. With any luck, perhaps this will
rekindle the 'flame', and cause me to return....

  I could mention recent MOnk 'nerfs', but they really didnt have much to do
with anything. Made me angry? Yes, tipped me over the EQ edge for more than
just a 10k fall? No. They where just a small cherry on an otherwise large
leaving cake (where the hell do I get my anolagies from????)

  It has definatly been my absolute pleasure in writing for you all,
speaking to you all, and moderating your too fucking big signatures, and I
could take this oppurtunity to rattle off names of people who have made me
laugh, or smash the keyboard in dispair, but I am crap with names, and I
would end up putting you all in the wrong catorgories, so I wont.

  So,

  /bow

  Bodi touches his heart, lips and head.
