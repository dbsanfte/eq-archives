  You're probably going to want to be somewhere
near the 40 mark to be able to kill the grimling
runner in Tenebrous Mountains.  The rest of the
quest is a turn in and some tailoring combines and
has no level requirement.

  Most evil classes are extreme KOS to Rallik, the
guy you turn in the runner's pouch to.  If I were you
I'd take a "good" friend along to loot the nodrop runner's
pouch and turn it in (pretty sure the resulting rallik pack
pattern is tradeable) or else park one of your own alts
nearby so you can kill the runner and then quickly log
out and bring an alt in to loot.
