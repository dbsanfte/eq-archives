Assuming you have the LoY expansion, the entrance is in Stonebrunt Mnts.
You can get a port to Stonebrunt or get to Tox Forest (via Book or Spire)
and run thru Warrens (off Paineel Newbie area)
When in Stonebrunt head south to the coast and walk along until you see a
huge boat called "The Abysmal Lady"
Board the boat and click on the set of double doors in front of you from the
jetty to zone in.

Haven't found any maps for it yet but I have heard you can d/l the map files
and put them in your EQ directory, there by giving you the Maps when you hit
Backspace.
