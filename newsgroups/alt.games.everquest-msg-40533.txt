The 410000 number is accounts, not characters.  Even assuming some multiple
accounts for one player, that would still put the number of accounts with a
level 50+ character up around 200000+.  Just thinking about the people I
know online, the number doesn't seem like it's way out of line, I would
guess that a bit over half the people I know online have a level 50+
character.
