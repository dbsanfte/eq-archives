Nah, didn't get rid of the AWE-64.  It's in the "parts box".  I have better 
sound cards than the 64, but never had a reason to install them, so I'm ok 
there. I did find out that I'm out of 100mb NICs, though!  That hurt, 
because I swear I had some more.  I know I've given some away, but I can't 
fathom that I gave away all my 100s.  Too much beer...

I have several HDDs lying around, including a 30gig, and my boot drive is 
in a removable drawer, so I may install '98 on that drive.  I used to have 
all my games on a '98 drive like that, but EQ and UT and a few others that 
I played worked in Win2k, so I got rid of the '98.
