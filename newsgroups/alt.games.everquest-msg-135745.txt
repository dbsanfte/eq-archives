its finally my turn to post something to a newsgroup along the lines of
"tonight i won the roll on the fungi!"

i was wandering bazaar, looking for an "empty" place where i might drop my
*fabulous* raw silk robe, raw silk pants, and raw silk collar . .. then
quickly log my monk, and pick them up

i FINALLY found a spot, deep near the pvp part, where soem other guy had the
exact same idea

i picked up 12k worth of stuff . ..  he saw me and didn't say anything, so
maybe HE wasn't the him who dropped the stuff

i bought lots and lots of new toys to complement my raw silk robe


and i bought an fbss for the monk who last night gave me some (*GASP*) wu's
and rhino hide armor

he was like "?!?!??!?!??????????????????????????????? !!!!!!!!" for 30
minutes

listens to tool, accidentally buys too much armor and gives some away (free
spider fur on vallon zek!) . . . wute for now
