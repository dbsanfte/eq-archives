Okay it's obvious I got somewhat bitched at for my comment so I'll try and
respond.

1. I (aside from the eq aol 7.0 thing) have had very little problems with aol. 
It's a good service with lots of features.  I rarely get disconnect and (aside
from the short time dial up takes to connect) don't have trouble connecting. 
If you think aol is crap or buggy, good for you, because it's not for me.  Aol
is the best in my city (as far as I have found) for connecting to the internet.
 If I could get dsl or whatever, I would, but I'm not going to pay $40 a month
for faster speed yet crappier service, when I pay half that and get sometimes
better service and connection than my friends who use dsl.

2.  the way I see it, aol doesn't have to design it's service to work with ever
single program out there.  If the eq boys (or verant or whatever) can figure
out how to get aol and eq to work from their side they should do so, if not
they should kindly connect to aol and ask them to work something out.
In the meantime i'll use 6.0 for eq and 7.0 to do everything else.
