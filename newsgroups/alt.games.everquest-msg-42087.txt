You can just hand him the items. One little warning though, make sure you 
give him exactly 3250 gold...sounds stupid, but someone in my guild told 
me about a friend that gave him more than 3250 and lost everything...

Im not sure about this one...I've heard that he despawns after someone 
does the quest, but when I got to Rathe someone was celebrating the fact 
that he just got JBoots, and Hasten was still running around, so we were 
able to catch him. Either he doesn't despawn right away or the guy got 
his JBoots earlier and was still celebrating.

Just hope for good luck :P  If you get the monk, you wont be able to take 
him, so youll have to wait for him to despawn. It will also make things 
easier if you can get a ranger or druid to track Hasten for you, since he 
supposedly has several spawn points. 

One more tip is to have your partner keep hailing him while you are 
handing him the items, so he doesn't run off if takes you too long to get 
the 3250 ready.
