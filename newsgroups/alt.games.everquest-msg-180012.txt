Systems have changed since it first came out, technology has improved.
The code has been patched with upgrades, enhancements, expansions, and
so forth so many times over the years that I'd challenge even the best
programmers to keep it smooth every time. No, it's not that simple to
just update all the out of date code. Some of it would most likely
require re-writing the entire engine.

Are you a coder, Silverlock? Have you ever worked with code on a 4+
year old base engine that's been getting patched at least once a
month? No? Then don't be so sure that it's entirely the fault of
"crappy coders" until you're talking from firsthand experience. I'm
not saying that's not a possibility, but just that given the
information I have, it's one of the least likely possibilities. Their
coders aren't the best in the world by far, I'll grant that, but I
wouldn't go as far as to call them "crappy".
