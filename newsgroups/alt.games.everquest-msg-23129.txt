Nice day, sun was out in the lake of ill omen and we're hunting sarnaks, as
usual. Well, theres a sarnak gem oracle or something with a silly name like
that. We kill it, and we all rest up. About 30 seconds later we see: <I
forgot the guys name, will get it in the morning> has looted a sarnak ring
of station. WHAT THE FUCK? Once in a blue moon the ring drops and some guy
ninja loots it!! We all ask him why we didn't roll for loot right etc. He
just says sorry, he didn't know. He had just ninja looted something that was
worth 10k in looting rights (ok not sure about that, just some bystander
told me). I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do now. Is that reportable?
Trainable (heh, I'm a monk)? Please help...
