Are you sure about this? I know for certain that a GFluxed mob wont get hit
by other AoEs while it is in the air. Sure there are certain places were AoE
will aggro stuff from other floors but they are pretty well documented and
tend to involve places that suffered when object-collision was removed from
certain in-game checks (ie the floor between the bar and tower in Unrest
isn't a 'real' floor, its more like the wall of an inn - mobs will ignore it
and so will AOE checks).
