It *is* sort of sad though that not only is most of the recent content
gold spam, but it's gold spam targetted at a different game.  (And then
spewed indiscriminately to other groups because, well, it's spam.)

Heck, there wasn't even the usual griping about the servers not coming
up on time after last night's downtime!

Speaking of which, I had to go to work before the servers came up, so I
haven't had a chance to see what's new, but I read the patch notes in
the loading screen and it looks like they're starting the events leading
to the expansion of Seeds of Destruction.  Anyone have any details yet?
(I enclose the relevant portion below.)

================================================================

The Tides of Anachronism

All across Norrath and beyond, the boundaries between past and present and
between parallel realities seem to be fraying.

Within the normally peaceful Plane of Knowledge, three heralds of Druzzil
Ro entered the realm; bringing warnings of troubled and dangerous times
ahead.

"Danger has arrived! Our time is very short! Time is ticking and our doom
may have arrived! As it passes, time takes with it portions of our lives.
Well, your lives. And now it threatens to take all of our lives. Powers of
chaos and destruction are taking their time, taking our time! Go quickly,
time is so very short."

Meanwhile, over in the Dreadlands, a retired scholar named Deckarn
Mystglade is seeking someone to help keep him from losing his mind.

A few years back when the Plane of Time was first breached by Norrathian
adventurers, Deckarn warned his fellow scholars that interfering with the
realm of time would only lead to disaster. After continuously trying to
prophesize his unproven theories, he was forcibly requested to retire.
Since then, Deckarn has been a bit unsure of anything around him.

Over the past few weeks, Deckarn has been feeling a strange shift in time
and began to have visions of epic battles, re-building, corruption, decay,
and war. Uncertain of himself, he needs someone to investigate the
mysterious occurrences in his visions to confirm that he isn't going
insane.

Curious adventurers begin to travel to the Plane of Knowledge and the
Dreadlands to hear the rumors first hand.
