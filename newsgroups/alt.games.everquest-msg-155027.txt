I agree, all around.

I'm responding because of this last bit.  My guess is that the extra syllables
in
"Jeezum crimon entley!*" are to represent the (arguably) stronger "Jesus
Christ Almighty."  This is just a guess on my part.  In my family it was
something like "Crimonittly," and for me I also learned it from my mom.

Sorry to reply to such an old post.  I only configured this newsreader a
couple hours ago, and this was one of the first posts I read.  I'll skip to
later
ones from now on.
