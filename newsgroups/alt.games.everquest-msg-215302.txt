Can't you run SWG from the beta disc and just patch it? When I tried to play
it after the game went gold it appeared to be letting me, all I needed to do
was register an SWG subscription. I didn't want to pay for a subscription
based on my test experience, so I don't know if it would have let me on
afterwards...
