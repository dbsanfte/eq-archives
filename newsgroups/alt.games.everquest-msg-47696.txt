Perhaps in order to make better suggestions or what-not, I should installed
the dreaded ShowEQ. ;)  Or atleast look at its source code.  There's an
idea.  Assuming the packet structure has already been diciphered for me (I'm
too lazy to do it only to better EQ, which would be my only reason to have
done it), it would take little to no time at all to see exactly what is
being sent to the client.

So yes, his recommendation is not only a good one but very doable.  When I
give further thought to it, for the information to be sent only once at a
time would be a contridiction to what I was thinking and saying at time of
reply. <grin> Maybe moving and staying up 36 hours had something to do with
it, in either case I was wrong.  My mistake. ;)

Yeah, I mixed up the two.. sigh.. that should have been an indication to
start the other pot of coffee. ;p

Ack.  I did over look that part.  Thanks for pointing that out to me.  Yes,
then in that case, it would be a good thing.  Though, would doing this take
out the "challenge" of the game... <grin>
