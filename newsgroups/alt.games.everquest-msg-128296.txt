A /report without a /petition is, generally, useless.  You have
to /petition to get a guide/GM's attention and then they'll look
at the report (if they want.)

So it's:

(scroll to get the 10 lines on the screen)
/report charname
/petition I'm reporting Charname for bad language.  I did
a /report charname with the relevant information.

Then the guild/GM will (maybe) respond and look at the /report.
And probably tell the other person to knock it off right after
telling you to use the language filter...
