}Learn some basic algebra.
}X*(Y/Z+W) = X*Y/Z + X*W

}If I wanted to divide INT by 5+2, I would have had to put parenthises around
}the 5+2, or, I would have just put a 7 there.

}You will find, that by applying basic algebra rules to the equation I put
}forward that it is equivalent to the one you have put forward.  Facter out
}Level from yours, and look at what you end up with.

No, according to basic algebra rules, your formula is shy a pair of 
perintheses, and could mean *either* what you said, or what he said.  
However, according to the basic rules of operator precedence recognized in 
most computer languages, '/' is a higher precedence operator than '+', and 
hencce should be evaluated first.  Other computer languages, on the other 
hand, always go from right to left, so A/B+C != C+A/B.

But even outside of computer programming, you'd do well to include the 
extra perins.  Many (but not all) basic algebra texts will mention 
operator precedence, but usually with a codicil to the effect of, "you 
should know this just in case someone is silly enough to not put in all 
the perins they should."

You appear to be trying to apply the distributive law to prove your point, 
but alas, you've done it improperly.

X*(Y/Z+W) = (X*Y) / (X*Z) + (X*W)

Which doesn't really clarify the operator precedence issue.

Use the extra perins, they won't bite.  And it gets really important in 
advanced algebra, where operators no longer necessarily mean what you're 
so used to them meaning, and the rules of precedence, if any even exist, 
may be different.
