For the past couple of days it seems I am losing my connection when I die. I
get bumped back out to the connect screen and then I get an error message
when attempting to log back in stating it cant connect to update server and
I should run the updater again (which does nothing to help the problem) and
that this is usually just temporary. (which it is) after 10 mins or so I can
get back in. Any other server works fine. I can get into them, just not the
one I was playing on. Anyone else experiencing this and is there a fix?
