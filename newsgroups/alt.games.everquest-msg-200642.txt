He's in SS on the WL side.  As you zone in from WL, go through the gate and 
make a right, it's Lieutenant Milven or something, a black drake, he's the 
first static mob you'll come across (may be some roamers around).  You can 
turn in helms AND toes, even before he gives you the toe quest which makes 
me believe you can turn in the stuff even at dubious (could be wrong about 
this, try with toes first since they're definitely more common).  I know 
tons of toes drop in GD and they're easy hunting if you're going to ToV.  
You can also buy 'em pretty cheap (5-10pp each for toes on Karana).  Note 
that Storm and Frost giant toes work.  They do seem to be a very large 
faction hit.
