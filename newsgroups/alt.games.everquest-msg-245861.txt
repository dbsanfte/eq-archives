I'll answer from my experiences with my 65 enchanter.

So far I have never had a DC resisted.  But yes sometimes those LB mobs are
higher than 46, in which case you get a message saying as much, and the DC
ability is reset immediately.  Also the mob will agro you, and any nearby
buddies.  There are a few marked mobs that are in the right level range but you
will not be able to DC.  Ran across it once, forgot who it was.

When a DC does land, so far I have not had it agro nearby mobs.  Of course when
I DC, it is either a mob to itself or close to similar mobs level-wise.
However, when I DC a pet in, for example, Veksar, there are times when running
past mobs, where my normal pet wouldn't agro a mob, but the DC one does.  Just
like any normal summoned pet used to before they fixed that.  Probably because
of the pet's level, a mob will agro on a 46 level pet fighting, when they
wouldn't agro on your standard best summoned pet.  Best example I can think of
is PoJ, where your DC pet is suddenly surrounded with adds.  Everything there
well get on my DC, nothing does on standard pet.

Yes the DC pet can be canceled by Cancel Magic.  So important to know what mobs
you will be fighting in advance.  Only good thing is that maybe the mob doing
the CM will also cancel out your haste buffs, etc. that were on the pet.  :)

Invis does break DC like any other pets.  If you go invis, the pet will agro on
you.

Unfortunately, not all DC pets can be properly shrunk.  Namely giants and
dragons come to mind.

There are lots of fun things you can do with DC.  You can DC that druid guy in
FoB and pretty much wipe the zone with him.  Good way to solo Tangrin in there.
Never did try DC on any Fabled mobs, anyone else did so?

You also can't use...  forgot the name, I don't have it.  That AA to put your
pet away in storage and summon another.  You can't put a DC pet away.  However,
you can put your summoned pet away, then grab a DC pet.

I first grabbed the first two levels of Animation Empathy, so I can finally tell
my pet to attack without me getting beat on first.  I then grabbed DC, then
finished off the last Anim Emp.

But, this is coming from a chanter that doesn't raid much and never really uses
charm.  So yeah if you can properly charm at will, pretty much no need for a DC
pet, unless those solo times of farming lower end things, or time of play where
you may get interrupted often.
