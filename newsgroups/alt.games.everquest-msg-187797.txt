You can push the 50% limit though. If you're wearing gear that gives you
hit points directly, remove the gear first (taking care not to kill
yourself), then bind wounds to the limit, then put the gear back on.

Tedious example follows:
Suppose you had 1000hp base and 200hp on your gear, for 1200 total.  You
finish a fight at 300 of 1200. If you take off gear, you're now at 100hp
of 1000. Then bind wounds to 500hp of 1000. Then put gear back on bringing
you to 700hp of 1200. Compare that to binding wounds with your hp gear on,
which would only get you to 600hp of 1200.

For soloing types, that extra cushion of hit points can mean the difference
between pulling now and pulling 3 minutes from now.

Note that this trick applies only to gear with bonus hitpoints, not to
gear that grants hitpoints indirectly via stamina. It also requires that
you have enough inventory slots to hold all that gear. Only you can decide
whether the hassle of keeping 2 empty 10-slot bags on hand and transferring
all your gear into them -- and back -- is worth getting an extra 400hp (for
example) back on your bind wounds....
