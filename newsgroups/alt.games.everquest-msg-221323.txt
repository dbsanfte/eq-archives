Biggest advantage for a gnome rogue; never having to drool over the
tinker's mask. I went with a dwarf myself. I don't really understand why
you guys think dwarves aren't a fitting race, probably because I never
played D&D. Norrathian lore, what there is of it, seems to support
dwarven rogues pretty well; even the rogue that was hired by Mistmoore
to steal something from the Ring of Scale was a dwarf, reputedly the
best thief in the land. Having dwarves be rogues seems to fit the
Tolkien lore as well, as he portrayed dwarves as very materialistic,
which to me would suggest a few would naturally drift into the less
honest means of aquiring weath. Was there some D&D lore that made
dwarves too scrupulously honest to be rogues or something?

Anyway, I picked a dwarf and I'm happy with the choice. The other good
point you neglected to mention was the dwarven roll, at least with old
models, the somersault when you jump while running is well worth the
choice, IMO. Of course I never denied being a powergamer either.

Another slight advantage to the barbarian is their racial ability to
slam, which, while doing only one point of damage, is often enough to
stop a runner for a few seconds when the snarer in the group falls
asleep occasionally. Assuming this is a twinked character, shrink
potions or even a shrink device help a lot with the main disadvantage,
and the kunark helm, once you hit 45, is a source of free ultravision.
You could always use the glowing stone band from Sol A until then as
well, as they seem really cheap on my server anyway. Is that old uv
helm that dropped from one of the fire giants in Sol B rogue wearable?
