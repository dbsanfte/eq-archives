Thanks for beating me to the punch *g*  And not just from 25, btw.  22 
is fine to go.  GR has people as low as 20 in the group (although rarely 
lower).  About 23, try to get into the GR groups.  And then, at about 
26, try for the RR :)  The nice thing about HHK is that it's *so* 
populated that the only time you're gonna get a train is when someone of 
monumental stupidity comes along.  If you're playing in the GR and see 
someone coming along with a room full of warriors or raiders on him ... 
just run.  Do not stop at the guards, because often, during a train, 
several of them will go down before all the goblins are killed.  Go very 
far away, and if you get aggroed by *anything*, zone out.  Meanwhile, 
enjoy listening to the sounds of "WTF PULLED THE RAIDER ROOM?????" "I 
DIED AND LOST MY LEVEL THANKS A LOT STUPID GAME @!#$!@#$" and so on, and 
so forth.  Again, that's not a common occurence.  Usually because once 
someone does that, it's quite hard for them to find another group 
willing to take them.
