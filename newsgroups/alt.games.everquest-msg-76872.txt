Dear group,

I read Xornn's guide for enchanters, which, like several people said
here already is an excellent guide and really has given me more
confidence playing my enchanter alt.

Now, basically since level 16 I gave up the idea of soloing my
chanter, but I felt I needed to try the charm soloing techniques that
were on Xornn's pages, so I took a portal up to the moon and went to
Marus Seru, with creatures mostly blue to my 34 enchanter.

To my surprise it worked really well, but since a fight takes much
longer time than usual group fights, there kept coming adds. One or
two adds were good and I just put them in a nice mez queue, waiting to
be slaughtered by one of his former mob friends, but the adds kept
coming, and I eventually ran out of mana and had to run to zone...

Now, I was thinking, a perfect place to keep practicing this technique
would be an isolated mob camp (as in not many aggro adds) with 3-4
blue to me mobs, that respawn rather quickly, and that can be charmed
& mezzed.

Can anyone recommend such a place for me to go?

I was thinking maybe the spectres in oasis? Are they blue to a 34? do
they have reasonably low MR? Or Underbulks in Echo Caverns maybe?

I will appreciate all location suggestions,
thank you!

/Daniel
