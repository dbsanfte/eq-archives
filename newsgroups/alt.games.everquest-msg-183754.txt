I'm guessing that this character will not be Power Levelled to the same
extremes as said Cleric. Of course I don't know, maybe there is a levelling
competition going on with all BB's Teir 1 guilds. Seeing as the character
was level 1 when I logged on and the servers had been up a few hours
already, I doubt it was with this character, if there were.
