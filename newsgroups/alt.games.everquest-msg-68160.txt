Left out soloing. There seems to be a group of people for whom the
ability to solo any class is a must and that seems to be what they do
a lot. I found DAoC a very lonely game. I played 6 levels and not a
single group. The online community factor in this game is low. In the
city/village zones are the only place you can use a /shout command and
usually it's pretty quiet except for the "How do I..." messages.
