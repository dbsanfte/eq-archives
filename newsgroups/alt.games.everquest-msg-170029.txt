This, sadly, I must agree with.  However, to say that the game doesn't
start until 50 is something else.

I am having bags of fun with a chap at 38, a cleric at 29 and a mage
at 11.    And there is still a lot of places where I could have been
and yet haven't.

I still have to explore High Pass Keep, for example and I have just
come out from Runny Nose so even for us low level characters there is
plenty to see and do.
