EQ is and always will be at least as much a game as it is a world. The 
trolls watched with relative disinterest as the frogloks occupied their 
homeland. The good folk of Norrath as much as the evil *enjoyed* the 
march of evil into Firiona Vie. 

And nobody has raided the Overlord Mata Muram because of his immoral 
enslavement of other beings... it was always and only for the joy of 
defeating a challenge, and his shiny trinkets. Most people don't even 
know or bother with the backstory that supposedly provides them 
motivation.  The don't need it... its enough to know they haven't killed 
it yet, and that it has neat toys if they do.
