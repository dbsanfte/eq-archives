The kind of lag that causes some people to run slowly won't
show up on the "lag meter".  The meter only shows communications
efficiency.  The other kind of "lag" that people often complain
about (and which they actually notice more easily than
true communications lag) is framerate/CPU lag.

When your CPU or graphics card is being pushed to their
limits (or beyond), the game will be choppy, sluggish, or
less than responsive, and will actually make your character
run slower for various technical reasons.

For a long time a guildmate had a *really* slow computer,
and even though her ISP connection was good and her data
meter never showed problems, she ran so slowly that we'd
see her character literally run three steps forwards and
then "teleport" two steps back continuously as she traveled.
It took her forever to cross a big zone.

An easy way to tell if this is the source of a "run speed"
problem is to time yourself running across a set course,
and then time it again in non-fullscreen view (i.e., the
one with all the menus/buttons), with your clipping plane set
*all* the way down and sky off, and with your view angled down
so that you're looking at the ground just in front of
you instead of all the way to the horizon.  If the
second run is considerably faster than the first, then
you've got a video or CPU bottleneck (or maybe even
memory thrashing).
