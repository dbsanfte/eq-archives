I'm randomly snipping stuff since these posts are getting to obscene
lengths. Basically removing the 'beaten a dead horse' stuff.

And at the level we're talking, the members don't want to go on epic
raids or even hear about them.

>After all...what on earth else is there for a guild to cater to?

There are guilds to cater to that need. And those that are going after
epics usually join them. High level guilds cater to high level gear
needs. Epics haven't fallen in the high level gear arena for a long
time.

Personally, that's cool with me to as long as its done in their
offtime and not done as a guild raid unless the members specifically
wanted it for the 'fun aspects'.

... You are actually suggesting a GM is /tell'ing members with silly
questions WHILE a raid is engaged on a target? That simply is not
going to happen. Even if one were stupid enough to become the excuse
for any wipe and a complaint lodged against him by a lot of irate
members, it wouldn't crash the macros if that were the intention.

It only needs to be kept straight until such time as the GM gives up
trying. And there is a very short attention time for that given all
that a GM has to do. As it stands, a raid can barely get the attention
of a GM currently dealing with 3 different things, he's going to drop
all he's doing to give your raid the 3rd degree? Not.

Actually.. most guild chat isn't very coherent as is, very
intellectual, or very unique and non-redundant :>. It might be an
interesting programming experiment to generate fake guild chatter
using the commonly talked about issues brought up there. You could
have a RL'r on a bot come up with any issue off a catch phrase and
have the bots gnash on it with pre-programmed responses. The more
random you get the less the pattern shows. The main issue being an
substantial rise in the amount of computing power you need during
those times, but if non-raiding.. *shrug* :>. Second, if a GM is gonna
despawn an event he'd better be prepared to prove his point about bots
and hope to god he's right. If not, massive amounts of complaints will
be lodged against him for despawning a currently running event. Third,
if teamspeak wasn't used as an excuse for not responding, it sure
would make a good one as to where all the guild chatter goes.

Actually, one of the biggest give aways that you would have to guard
against is making sure you have multiple ISP's and a backed up
uninterruptible power source. Nothing like the power going out to LD
everyone at the same time to really ruin your day :>.

>What are you going to do write an 'inane chatter engine' too... I bet even
>that wouldn't pass more than a cursory examination.

I usually answer posts in order, so i didn't see this before i wrote
that. So.. pretty much. And you severely overestimate the maturity and
non-redundancy of guild chatter. It doesn't have to be gold.. just
good enough to not raise a flag. Having bots cyber with each other or
even real people would also be a fun type of disinformation.

The problem is the upfront capital and time involved, as with any
other programming project. That's why I said it would make an
interesting business plan. You're still looking at a minimum of a
couple months programming and design project with the hardest part
being the tearing apart of the game and learning where the hooks are
to be able to interface your programs to it.

>Game companies have striven for years to come up with human like
>AIs...

Game companies are also hindered by the fact that the programs they
come up with have to be completely independent of human contact.
That's the difference. If the raid had to completely be bots and act
with no human interactions, it would be hell on earth to make. In the
case of my programs you are simply using automation so a lot fewer
people can control and manipulate a raid.
