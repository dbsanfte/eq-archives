Just wondering if anyone has any info on these.  I've seen them listed
on Allakhazam and Casters Realm, with Allakhazam claiming they drop
off creatures in TD, without specifying WHAT mob.  Also, posters to
that site claim the boots have been nerfed, but an in game guide says
that as far as they know, they've not been altered.  Spent several
hours in TD searching with no luck, along with fruitless on-line
searches.  Any ideas?
