Trust me it is great.
My enchanter was doing the rat tooth quest for a few levels, then got
bored of that and started to kill the locals.
My baby necro was managing to kill all 9 of the entrance mobs (just)
while they were still dark blue.

From about 12 you can do the tooth quest (if you are not Kos)

I really want to take a raid there one day and kill them all <G>
