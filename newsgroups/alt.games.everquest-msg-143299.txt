Thanks for the suggestion. I now realize I did forget to mention that I have
an advisors robe, and stein of moggok, a +2 INT ring, a +3 INT GM event (one
in WC few weeks back), and then my armor was looted off of orc pawns.

Also thanks for not just recommending I go to the Bazaar.  That is the WHOLE
reason I'm asking, is what is the point in looking if you don't know what to
look for or how much to spend on it?

No I don't have anyone to do the Temple of Solsik Ro quests with.  Thats one
reason I'm now playing a Necro is so I can summon my group (mainly due to
playing hours and not having every day to play either).

I'll check out those bat skull ear rings (for 100pp or less each or per 2?).
