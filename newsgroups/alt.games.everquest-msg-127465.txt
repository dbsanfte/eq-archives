Again, exceptions to the rule abound.  During a recent clearing
of Kael to Tormax (Tormax wasn't up, and it was just a practice
run of my alt's guild to see how we were doing), my alt rogue
ended up as the secondary off-tank because her AC was
higher than several of the warriors who haven't been lucky enough
to have a 60 rogue with 3 years of plat behind them bankrolling
their armor.  When you win a roll on a chain BP and end up not
only giving it to your ranger guildee but also buying her the 3
flawless diamonds to get her BP, you know that getting your
guildees some better gear is a priority.

Now a Horn of Hsegra is a different story...
