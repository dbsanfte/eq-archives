Excellent link.

You're right - it is surprising how many are being developed. It's
kind of depressing, though, how many have been halted.

Relatively few "space" variety sci-fi ones. Jumpgate looks very
interesting to me. I've been playing Space Trader on my Palm lately -
it's a simplistic yet highly addictive game, and Jumpgate seems as
though it has a lot of similarities.
