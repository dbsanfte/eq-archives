Agian I'll refer to my Did you look for your self post..  Ok done

1st site listed http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=328

2nd Site listed http://www.eqdiva.com/default.asp

The first one will help you ith all your general questions.  The second one
is a great minstal page..  Lots of bard info...  read the GUIDE pages..
after youlearn that info you sould be a much beter bard.

Now if you downt want to go to those pages.  the answer is that Symphonic
harmony lowers your agro by 100..  of course you have to hit the target for
it to take efect, which may rase your Agro more than that amount depending
on level/lacil diferences.    Where this is nice is if you have a main tank
attacking in the front you can be at the side/back swinging and not bulling
agro from the MT.  If the mob turns on you  just stop swingiogn and stand
there while the MT take agro back( should only take 1 or 2 swings )  then
swing 2 atacks for every 3 of the MT( auto on..3 seconds, auto off, one
second  Repeat)  ou should be real good at this by now with your twisting
ability teaching you how to move around the keyboard.

Again.  Hope that help's...  But please people just do a Quick search...  If
you want to make it real easy use a search bar like this one..  It's great.
http://www.dqsd.net/  OK that's 3 good links I'm done.

Omiin.
