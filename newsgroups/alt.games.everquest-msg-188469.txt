Lol - I held the guild record (I might still hold it actually)
summoning food with my cleric.  Same problem you have.  My record was
65 fizzles in a row without having to med (had KEI).  Wouldn't have
been so bad, but the two warriors I was with counted along... and
broadcasted it in /gu.

Anywho, I vowed to buy no more food or drink until it got better and
started every play session with a fizzle fest whilst summoning 20 food
and 20 water.  Over the course of a few weeks that made a nice
difference and I was able to quit that one.
