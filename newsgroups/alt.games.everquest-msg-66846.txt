OK, picked up SoL.  Wasn't planning on it, but Best Buy has it for
$20, so I figured what the heck, might as well check it out.

Here are my trivial observation while I wait for the patch to
download.

Plus so far: my God, they actually used a readable font for the serial
number!  I thought that violated some kind of industry rule.

Minuses so far: I don't like ads in installers for products that
aren't from the company whose software I'm installing (I don't like
those, either, but I will restrain myself there).  One of the screens
during the SoL install was an ad for Falcon PC systems.  I don't think
Sony owns a stake in Falcon.

The placement of the serial number is silly.  It should be behind disc
#3, since you finish the installation with disc #3 in the drive.
