I'm aware of what you were really saying.  It's just that the point loses
its potency when it's plain to see he stated his credentials (whether they
are true or false) only after you seemed to imply that he is a newbie.

Maybe my news server isn't carrying that posting.  I just looked at all of
the postings under his name that my news server has provided me, as I was
following that thread yesterday around the time I made my original posting
in this one.  I just don't see anywhere he attempts to depict what the
majority wants.  He has opinions that are apparently unpopular on this
newsgroup, and with which I do not agree, even though my primary is a
wizard, but this does not make him an idiot.

Agreed.

 I'm going by how he

It's all a matter of how you read it, I suppose.  I just see a guy trying to
explore new possibilities in the game.  I don't agree with having more spell
slots, so I didn't post agreement with him.  I could have even posted my
disagreement.  But I don't see how it helps anyone to make him out to be
some evil, underhanded son of a bitch, especially since it's a safe guess
none of us knows what the guy is like in real life.
