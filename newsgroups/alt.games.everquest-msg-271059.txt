No, it shows that Blizzard has watched launches over the years and had a
different take on how to manage them.

From their release on the subject:

"Blizzard Entertainment and its retail partners are expecting all remaining
supplies of World of Warcraft to sell out soon. Meanwhile, the company is
working diligently to increase server capacity to accommodate the growing
number of players connecting to the game. As the additional servers are
brought online and proven stable, additional copies of World of Warcraft
will be made available at retail. Blizzard will announce the availability of
those additional games as soon as they are on retail shelves."

Whether or not that method of launch number management will work or not
remains to be seen.  I do give them kudos for trying something different and
not just flooding the marketplace with their product.
