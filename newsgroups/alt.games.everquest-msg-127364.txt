You know, the entire time I was there, I didn't notice all the mosques, or
the arabic garb.... gee, don't I feel silly.  Now, if you're done with your
little jibs, can we get on to discussing things with reason?  Try not to get
so caught up in the labels, and follow the ideas.

Of course, you're also aware that a significant number of Bahrainian
residents are Roman Catholic, are't you?  Bahrain is far more "western" than
any other Islamic nation.  Maybe that's why it has a thriving economy that
isn't based on oil.

sole voice of one side, and having to reply to being double and triple
teamed!
