I have heard this so many times:

"When bar hits 0, you swing slower and hit less."
"When bar hits 0, doesnt matter as long as your over 100."

Well, Im a 51 champion and i have noticed that sometimes number 2
seems to be true.

What are you thoughts?  I did a search for this type of thread, but
did not see any.  Saw a lot of indeivual posts, but no threads.
