That's why I like a masterlooter. Your ogre buddy would be ideal.-str-.
By one person doing the split of coin it evens out the auto verant split
where the looter gets most plat. Items can go to who wants use /ran after
the master looter fills up or during downtime.

I find it amusing we all instantly put our exp into anyone's hands when
looking for a group.
But folks get wary of a master loot method.
