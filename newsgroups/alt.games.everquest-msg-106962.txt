I fell in the lava one time trying to flee a train.  Screaming OMG! I was
swept into zone for SolB.  Seeing my health getting lower and lower I decide
to zone back in and hope I can figure out how to get out before I die.  Too
late, died anyway.  At least I'm in zone I started in.  CR from Freeport,
long boring run.  When I get there, my corpse is not in the lava it is at
the zone line.  I think someone petitioned when I fell and the GMs kindly
pulled it out before I got there.  Was alot more careful running up the
stairs after that.
