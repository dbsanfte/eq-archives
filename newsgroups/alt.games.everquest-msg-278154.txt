Let me rephrase a little bit.  I don't want to 'buy' an account.  I know many 
people have quit EQ and I'm willing to bet that some have no desire to play 
again so there are accounts just sitting there never to be played again.  If 
someone reads this and would like to give me their account I'd be more than 
happy to take it off their hands.  If not then no big deal I will buy the 
expansions again and start a new account on my own.  Thought I would try going 
this route first.
