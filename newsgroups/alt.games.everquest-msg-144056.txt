Profound?  Hard to say.

Some would say levels 51-60, but I don't agree.  The higher levels do extend
the game, but it's really just a continuation of the level treadmill, and
didn't impact the day-to-day playing experience.

If I had to make a list, it'd be (in no particular order):

Soulbinders
No loss of items on do-not-combine
Removal of hell levels
Removal of class exp penalties
Pets no longer aggro mobs
Pets no longer break mez
No exp loss before level 10
No corpse loss before level 10
Ability to put stuff in bags in the bank
/targetgroupbuff
The bazaar
The new UI
The Nexus
