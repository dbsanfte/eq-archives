*shrugs* When it comes to casters, being a twink doesn't make a difference
at all. The extra intelligence you have by having twinkie gear, makes your
mana pool bigger, but it still takes the same time to med back that mana,
wether you're a twink or not. Yes, you can cast longer with a bigger mana
pool, but in a group, you're generally not going to be casting too much
during the combat, perhaps one to three spells, depending on class. I have
played both a twink and a non twink in a group, as caster and priest class,
and neither makes any difference. There mgiht be some advantages for tank
classes, though I don't know much about them :o) I don't like people
"advertising" their twinkness. To me it is saying: Look at me! I am too lazy
to do anything when it is still a challenge! I'd rather do it when my main
is 30 levels over the level requirement.

Anyway, my little rant before I go to bed :o)
