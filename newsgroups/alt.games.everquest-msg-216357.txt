Hehe sorry, but I don't have time to read everything (though I enjoy your
stories).

If he's considering DELETING his warrior, bonk him up-side his head a few
times, and just cancel that account and buy a new CD.  You've spent a lot of
time on him...it'd be a waste when, 6 months from now, he finds that he
wishes that he didn't delete the warrior after all.
