First, as for your spells, u have 3 chooses, ask a higher lvl player what
the spell does.  Second choose is to caste it on yourself and see what
happens, thats what i used to do when i first started :-D.. Third go on a
website like eq.castersrealm.com or allakazam, they have plenty of info on
all the spells and effects in the game.
As for items that are magical, thats different from them having an effect.
Some items are just "magical", u will need that concept just to kill certain
mobs.  In other words there are plan weps and there are magical weps.  If
there is an effect and u need to know what it is, again caste it on yourself
if u can or ask or go on one of those great websites.

Your grouping problem is not uncommon, if u don't play as often as some u
will find yourself with out constant groupies.  Just keep lvling and try to
stay in contact with those people u like grouping with, remember there are
65 lvls and u might just catch up, and there is a range in which u can group
with them again.  Just take 2/3 of their lvl to find out whats the lowest
lvl they can group with, same goes for u take 3/2 of your lvl to find out
whats the highesty lvl u can group with. Don't worry you might group with
them again.  As for soloing well, matters on the class, since ur a bst u
just have to learn ur class and how to solo them.

Where should u go at lvl 14 i would say try PC ( Paulden Caverns) insane exp
till lvl 24.  Blackborrow is another place I used to hunt at that lvl before
luclin.  Asking around u might get different opions about where to go.  Find
a place u like, look around EQ is very huge :-D.

hehehhe MAPS, before LoY i just asked around for where to find certain
things and when i could printed out maps from sites like eqatlas.com very
nice maps and pretty accurete,  i bought the eq atlas book.  Tell u the
truth its not to accurete at all, but it can give you a basic idia of where
2 go, and after a while thats all u need to find your way around EQ. The
book also gives you a brief summory of the zones and some notable NPCs in
the area.

I hope i answered some of your questions, next time put the server your on
down, someone might be able to give you a tell or something and yo migh find
new grouping buddies, I'm always good to make a new char just to hand with
certain people who aren't going to lvl up as fast as I do.
