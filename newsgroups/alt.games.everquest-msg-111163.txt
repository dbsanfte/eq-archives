 Since learning the strategy is half the fun I wont spoil it too much.
Basically we clear the 4-armed guards, then the right wall. From there
we position ourselves such that we don't need to worry about adds. By
the time IV is dead the room has repopped. We don't bother keeping a
wall clear but your method sounds like it would work well enough if you
can afford to peel off some of your damage and healing and dedicate it
to repops. If I were to do it that way I'd buff and med to full, quickly
kill the 4-5 on the wall then engage IV. Repops are about 6 minutes so
in theory you'd only need to kill repops once. I'd keep that wall group
out of the fight though, even at the beginning, since you don't want
them on IVs hate list. You don't want your wall groups cleric or tank to
be summoned while fighting repops since that could make things go bad.
