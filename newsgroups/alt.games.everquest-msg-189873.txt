Agreed.  Would be somewhat difficult to nerf them without nerfing 
"normal" groups as well though.

ZEMs being equal, a standard group will kill faster than a soloer (with 
perhaps the exception of a charm soloing enchanter), but *good* soloers 
will gain XP faster than any individual in a group.  An example of a bad 
group might be a cleric/warrior duo, who will probably kill slower than, 
say, a soloing ranger (higher DPS than the only damage producing member 
of the group in this case) or enchanter (my mana bar couldn't keep up 
with the slows at the speed my charmed drogmor was tearing through the 
gunthak caves last night).  On the other end of the scale, a group with a 
paladin, a cleric and 4 rogues might outpace the ranger xp-wise and maybe 
the enchanter kill-wise.

These would be examples of *bad* soloers.  However, they (usually) have 
the distinction of being highly sought after for grouping, as someone 
else in this thread pointed out.
