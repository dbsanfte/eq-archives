Aha, well this would change these figures drastically.  That
would put  amped chorus at 11 amped per tic, rather
than 18 amped per tic.

8 out of 9 cycles would be 9.777 mana per tic average,
while the more casual 10 cycle would yeild 9.5 mana per

Off to work at the moment but I suspect off the top of my
head that two bards in group doing amped chorus would
still be optimal bard to caster ratio, but now options that involve
someone keeping replentishment running become more interesting,
since those lines are 12 mana per.

Hmmm, where is this Reeds sheet?  I don't have to download
it do I?  I want information, not to open up my system to
virus invasion.
