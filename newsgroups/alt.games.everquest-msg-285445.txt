+AD4- What I have is a Hp Pavilion m7570n.  When I bought the computer I
+AD4- mailed in the upc on the box it came in in order to get the
+AD4- rebate+ADs- and since I didn't think I needed to consider anything
+AD4- beyond +ACI-agp+ACI- or +ACI-pci+ACI- when I knew I would
eventually
+AD4- have to upgrade the video card, I threw out the box with all the
+AD4- computer specs on it.   I have been going through the info thatt
came
+AD4- with the computer and can't see anything in there about what type
of
+AD4- expansion slots it has (I know how dumb I sound as I am typing
this.)
+AD4- Since my original post I have rechecked the info on my computer
model
+AD4- on the Best Buy and Circuit City sites and realized that I may
have
+AD4- made an error when I said I had no pci express slot.  Circuit City
+AD4- lists my model as having two pci slots available while Best Buy
lists
+AD4- my model as having one pci and one pci express slot available.
Upon
+AD4- checking through the Circuit City computers I saw no +ACI-pci
+AD4- express+ACI- expansion slots listed on any computer.  So I am
+AD4- guessing they are listing both the pci and pci express slots as
+AD4- +ACI-pci.+ACI-  At least that is what I am hoping.  I am planning
on
+AD4- paying a store to install whatever card I get.  I really, really,
+AD4- really, don't want to go digging around in there :)))))))  Just
+AD4- reading about the different aspects of video cards is
intimidating me
+AD4- :)  I can only begin to imagine the amount of trouble I can get
+AD4- myself into by messing around in there +ACE- Can anybody offer a
+AD4- suggestion for a good video card for EQ2 and it's expansions at a
+AD4- +ACQ-100 to +ACQ-150 range ?  I really appreciate the advice and
+AD4- information offered +ACE-  I did not realize how ignorant I was on
+AD4- all this until I started typing it out, lol.  Thank you for your
help
+AD4- +ACE-


did a search on the HP web site for m7570n and according to the product
spec (link below) you've got 3 PCI slots (1 free) and 1 PCI Express x16
slot (1 free)
