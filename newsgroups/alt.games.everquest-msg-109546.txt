    The worst part will be confirming the trivials of changed items.
Assuming that the order in which stuff trivials hasn't changed, someone
could PL a mule on a tradeskill and see where the trivs fall. But that'll be
a pain.

    It'll be worse to Grandmaster now. Take smithing. Now, banded gets you
to 175 skill. After the patch, it may only get you to say 150 skill. You'll
have to do those next 25 points on something that was previously harder,
like Fine Steel Plate or cultural. And those "previously harder" things are
generally more time-consuming and costly....

    Some things almost never change in price. We have a caster on our
server, Qanan, that farms EE Bags. He always sells them for the same price,
and has been doing so for about a year now. The people who buy just can't be
bothered to go get one themselves. Same thing for Tailored Backpacks - more
people may, in theory, may be able to make them but the average buyer still
can't be bothered and will pay the old price. The price is disjoint from the
ease of procurement, and is more like a service fee.
