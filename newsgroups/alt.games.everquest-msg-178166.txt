    It's damn difficult to keep a tank up with fast heals if you have to use
a CH chain. Might be easier now with the bigger cleric heals, but when I was
doing it Divine Light and Remedy (and the druid heals) just didn't have the
DHPS to last ten seconds for a switch.

    This is odd, then, because when my rogue uses Nimble mobs do NOT turn
away unless taunted off. I can think of a specific instance in PoG where she
got low health aggro, nimbled, and nobody in the raid could taunt it off me
until nimble faded and I was pasted. And I assure you, our monks have made
excellent nimble tanks for transitions.

    I've been in guilds prior to LC. And I've seen this in raid
environments. Guess how we positioned Emperor? A monk would go nimble, move
the Emperor to the corner with the warrior and himself hitting it to build
some aggro, and when the /disc dropped the monk would feign or die. Emperor
stayed on the monk.

    Ah, ok. That I did not know. As a cleric I don't look for the nimble
tank afterwards, I'm on the new MT. Might want a rogue or a bard with the
escape skill, then, to clear out aggro and keep DPS up.
