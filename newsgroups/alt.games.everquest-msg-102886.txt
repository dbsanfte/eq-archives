The rogue class armor is called ravenscale, nice armor and looks 
excellent. It used to be a rare drop in the underused dungeon of
Cazic-Thule. Now that the zone has been turned into a level 55+
dungeon the armor drops on the island out the front. All reports
are it's still pretty rare though.

I spent level 27-32 in CT and got *zero* drops, it's not even
that commonly available to buy.
