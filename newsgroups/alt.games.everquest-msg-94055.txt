My level 9 Ranger is definitely land bound at the moment, and happy to stay
there. A "newbie" question just raised in my mind though concerning the seas
and oceans in Everquest.

Are there:

Sea monsters that attack shipping or beachgoers from time to time?

Any underwater cities/ruins etc?

Can u actually (And I assume mad enough ) swim from continent to continent?

ANy other bizzare/trivia ocean facts would be appreciated.

Thanks

Pete
