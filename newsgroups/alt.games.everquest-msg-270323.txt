54 Mbps?  That's quite a connection there, you sure it's not more like 5 
Mbps, or even lower?  The DSL connections I've seen have been in the 0.5 
Mbps to 3 Mbps range.

5 Mbps will work out to around 500k bytes per second.  800MB/.5MB=1600 
seconds, or a bit under 30 minutes.

Your actual throughput will vary considerably depending on the load of 
the server your are downloading from, as well as your ISPs load, and 
anything in between the two.  The likely limiting factor is going to be 
their server, if many folks are taking advantage of this offer.

Does sound awfully high for downloading the game.
