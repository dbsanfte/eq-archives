Essentially,
    * STR is a factor in how hard you hit (ie how much damage you do)
    * DEX is a factor in how fast you learn offensive skills (offense, weapons)
and has a tiny part in determining the success of your special attacks (kick,
double attack, etc.)
    * AGI is a factor in how fast you learn defensive skills (defense,
blocking) and adds to overall AC (NOTE: it is now OFFICIAL WORD that monks get
a higher AC bonus for AGI than does any other class.)

There is a LOT of opinion and argument on how to kit out a monk. What follows
is my own opinions which are likely very different from the opinions of others.
This is what works for me.

Your very first concern is and must remain weight. At level 1, a monk gains an
AC bonus if he is below 14 weight (at 15, you start to loose DEF.) This does go
up slowly (I think at 20 you can carry up to 16 stone with no penalty) but will
ALWAYS remain a factor. Keep this in mind.

Agility is quite important, and easy to get without spending a huge fortune.
Get yourself a suit of Wu's Fighting Armor; each piece weights only 0.1, has
better AC than cured silk and gives an AGI bonus. If funds are limited, get at
least the shirt (9 AC, 4 AGI), the pants (6 AC, 4 AGI) and the cloak (5 AC, 4
AGI) at least. The slippers (5 AC, 2 AGI) are magical and will allow you to
Instill Doubt on magical creatures. The combination of low weight and enhanced
agility will have a very nice effect on your DEF rating.

The one exception to the Wu's would be gem inlayed gauntlets (8 AC, 3 DEX, 3
STA, 1.0 weight) for your hands; they're pretty inexpensive. They are magical,
so you can wear them and fight hand to hand with magical creatures. Wu's
gauntlets are a light source and offer no stat adjustments.

At level 20, you are doing 8 damage with your fists (perhaps as much as 20 each
hit by the time H2H skill and offense is factored in), with dual wield and
double attack making the occasional quad hit for that much. You are already
starting to outdamage warriors, and doing it with a 36 delay. On top of that,
the weight restrictions mean that you don't need a huge carrying capacity
anyway. Strength items are nice if they have other bonuses (jagged bands give 3
STR and 5 AC and aren't too expensive) but don't get strength at the expense of
other stats.

I personally would recommend getting direct HP and AC items as a first choice.
If you are on the poor side, get a pair of electrum fire opal rings (3 AC, 35
HP; player made); they run about 135pp each. Best, of course, would be velium
fire opal rings (6 AC, 65 HP), but they cost about 600pp for one. Also
something to watch for is electrum black sapphire earrings (2 AC, 25 mana, 35
HP; player made). Black sapphires are a mob drop only stone and are rarely
available; the earrings can cost as much as 450pp each. I have found black
sapphires on merchants where players have sold them and bought them back for
about 210pp each. If you get lucky and find some for sale that cheap, buy them
and take them to a jeweler you can trust; if you bring all the components, most
jewelers will combine for only a small fee (just group with them so you will
know success or failure of the combine.
