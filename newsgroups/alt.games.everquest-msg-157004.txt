I don't know about other druids but if I'm chosen for a group as a healer I
don't have the mana to be both a healer and a damage dealer.  I've never
seen a situation where I was chosen over a cleric to be a group healer.
Druids are still only secondary healers or healers in a group that can't
find a cleric.  Our new heals only make us more usefull as secondary healers
and I've never seen a group that didn't realize that.
