Yes, it's working great for Kaev at 55.  I imagine it's different
for those L65 groups tho, as a Paladin can't Pacify mobs higher
than L55.  At that point you have to have a Cleric or Enchanter
do the casting so the Paladin loses his biggest advantage vs.
other pullers.

One side effect of Pacify pulling is that I have never been so
dependent on mana regen.  Pulling/killing at the pace necessary
to succeed in LDoN consumes tons of mana for Pacify and stuns
to interrupt the casters, plus the occasional group heal when
you do fight multiple mobs.
