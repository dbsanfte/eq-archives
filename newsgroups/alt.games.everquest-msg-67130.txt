Somewhere on the Sony sight, it tells you all about it.  *Goes to look for
link*   And of course, rather than finding the page that SHOULD be there
under character transfer, there is now a page which simply says that all
character transfers have been put on hold during the first two weeks of
Luclin...  sigh...  But here is the link to save for future reference.....

http://everquest.station.sony.com/support/index.jsp

Eventually that link at the bottom of this page should be fixed...

I'm facing a similar situation in that I will be transferring accounts soon
and was trying to figure out if I would keep all of my items.  The response
to a thread about that here recently was very mixed...

Basically my question was and really still is:

If I move a character from a primary account to a secondary account but keep
her on the same server, do I keep all my items INCLUDING the No Drop stuff?
I'm holding off getting anything else for future Ivy Armor Quests and Epic
Quest until I know...  hehe

Thanks all!
