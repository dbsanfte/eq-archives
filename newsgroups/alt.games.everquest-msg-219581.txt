It's simply not possible to do 1-10 in an hour  without major PLing
help. The best I can do twinked and hitting PC at level 5, is level 10
in just over 3 hours. Even with a pocket-Druid supplying heals and
damage shields you will run out of things to kill and be waiting on
respawns long before you could hit level 10.
