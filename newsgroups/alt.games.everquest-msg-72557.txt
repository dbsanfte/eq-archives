	A Ranger can fearkite from 45 or so up to 53, 54 if you push it, in EW at
least.  After that you can try West Wastes, but that's risky 'coz of the bind
point issue (IE, there ain't one.)

  Haven't really had a chance to experiment with the Luclin zones, but except
for Tenebrous (which is lower level anyway) I hear they will work out.

	There's a shortage of outdoor zones where you can hunt, period, at those
levels.  Part of the reason why the Grey and Maiden's caught on so quickly.
(The fact that they were/are borked beyond belief helped, of course.)
