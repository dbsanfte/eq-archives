Okay, so the total damage I did was actually 35 points (assuming the
Darkness lasted for it's full duration).

I *really* don't think Patrolling Gnolls have 70 HP or less, and I'm
fairly confident that while it was crawling away, the Warrior did more
than 35 points damage to it.

So why did I get credited for the kill?
