I loved that run. Barbarian shaman returning to their homeland for
new spells and training. Having fought in foreign lands, bearing
rich treasures and now returning to the ancestral home. Perhaps even
some buffs and gifts for the young barbarians playing in the snow.
Great stuff. 

Mind you, SoW helps a lot. But then you can buy a potion for that.
Or a horse.

With PoK portals Everfrost is effectively adjacent to a huge
number of other zones. I'm as likely to find wood elves from
kelethin and frogloks from gukta as barbarians. Likewise seeing
some newbie dark elves levelling in the field of bone. It reduces
the personality of the zones quite a bit. I remember playing my
level 6 high elf paladin (damn that was a long run) in everfrost
and people noticing how unusual it was. 

I think the point ben is making is that convenience comes at the
cost of challenge and immersion. This is unavoidable. Some 
"immersion" is just too much, such as the EQ spellbook. Likewise
some convenience can make the game seem less like a real dangerous
world and more like a "playground" or weird "theme park".

Graveyards in PoP are sort of like this. Getting your body whisked
to a safe spot in a hostile zone, so you can gear up and go for the
zone boss again, is staggeringly artificial. Even if, at the same
time, I hate CR's as much as anyone. 

At the end of the day its a balance issue. There is a temptation
to remove everything that's hard, tedious, or dangerous and then
wonder why the game seems so un-inspiring.
