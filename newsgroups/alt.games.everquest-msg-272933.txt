It's my experience that if you elect to go and talk to Bob:
 "Hail, Bob."
 "Nice to meet you, Hughie. Go solo Nurga."

We all know the tasks need to be fixed, as they're uncompletable for various
classes at various level ranges. I'd at least partially settle for
having enough information to choose between tasks realistically. Oh, and
not being locked out of doing another task for over a week once I
completed one. That was when I gave up tasks entirely. ("It's a known
bug. Closing your petition.")
