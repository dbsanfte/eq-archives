***QUESTION PORTION***
Would you consider this a good trade?
Lamentation, Centi SS, Sentry Boots, for a Centi LS?

***GUIDE PORTION***

Well not exactly a "guide" but something I whipped up and printed out for
my own benefit.  I started fletching and wanted to know how to get my
level up the cheapest way :)  I started with 275pp and am now at 135 have
about 10pp left over and a backpack full of arrows, this took me maybe 2
hours.  I am sure I could have done more but I was in a zone where
merchants were indifferent, my CHA/INT/WIS is really low all -lt 75.

For doing this go to the merchant with the best faction to you:
(http://eqtraders.com/location/fletching.htm) <--- Listing This will help
with buying/selling obviously and should allow you to get a higher skill.
Brief arrow overview.  Arrow is made of 4 parts, each part has its own
trivial level, and you only need to upgrade one part at a time (one with
the next up trivial level) to actually advance in fletching.  You will
want to use the Shift key when purchasing or selling as it will skip the
quantity box and automatically buy/sell 20.  And the Control key when
trying to make arrows as this will automatically select 1.  Any arrows you
make while leveling up, sell!  The cost / selling ratio is actually not
bad at all and you can almost make your money back.  Below is a handy
little chart I made up to keep my level ups the cheapest.  The > # shows
the trivial level

Arrowheads             Arrow Shaft

FP,W,RC,MG > 36
FP,W,PC,LG > 46
FP,W,RC,SG > 56
FP,B,RC,LG > 68
FP,W,SC,LG > 82
H,W,RC,LG > 102
FP,W,WV,LG > 122
FP,C,RC,LG > 135
FP,W,BV,LG > 162
ST,W,RC,LG > 182
FP,W,CV,LG or FP,S,RC,LG > 202
CS,A,SC.SG > 250

NOTE: Condensed Substance Arrowheads and Acrylia Arrow Shafts have to be
used together with a Sheild Cut Fletch and a Small Groove.  The Arrowheads
and Shafts can be made with smithing (that will be next for me then :)

***STORY PORTION***
I was in a group last night, Me (warrior), an SK, a Necro, Cleric and 2
Enchanters.  Why were their 2 enchanters?  Beats the hell out of me.  Now,
one would think that with 2 enchanters it would be pull central!  Crowd
control, and haste, what more could a warrior ask for?  Well with this
group, a lot.

Either the SK or I would go out and pull a few things come on back and
target one of them, attack and then wait, and wait and wait for the others
to be mezzed.  80% of the time they wouldnt be, 15% of the time they would
try to mez the one we were attacking, then yell at us for it, so 5% of the
time they would get it right.  A lot of the time they would come in and
melee the Mobs (?)  We would tell them that is not their job and that they
need to stop doing that.  Calls for haste, totally ignored.  When we
started slowing the pulls down to 1-2 because the others were not getting
mezzed, we were yelled at by these enchanters for pulling too slow, and
that we should pull 3 or 4.  We would say "not until you start mezzing"
they would for a round or two, then back to nothing.  Now dont get me
wrong, we were getting experience, but not at the rate we should have,
with the ease we should have.

So the SK, Necro, Cleric and I decide to split off and start our own
group.  There was a warrior who was practicing 2hs on our mobs right there
so we pick him up despite his lower level.  We also pick up a druid we had
with us before the cleric showed up.  At this point the pulls started
flying, such a great group[1].  The enchanters started their own group as
well and watching their mayhem on multiple pulls was hysterical.
Their Necro and Bard running around kiting things, their other tanks
taking another one down, and where are those enchanters?  They were
sitting up in the SF entrance, doing nothing.  Heh, oh yeah, at level 34
the one enchanter had an INT of 103. *sigh*

[1] Best group I was ever in was the other night.  2 warriors, 2
Beastlords and 2 Shaman.  The DPS was insane and I was easily able to
maintain aggro of all MoB's on me (for the most part) while fighting.  So
the healing was primarily on me (plus regen) and with the damage we were
dishing out, MoB's dropped FAST.
