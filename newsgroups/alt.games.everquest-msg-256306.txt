I really wouldn't know where to begin other than to say that a.g.e. tends 
to help those who help themselves. ;) Read at least some of the manual and 
check out the tutorial, then come back with some more specific questions. 
Additionally, there is a FAQ that a few people have put a lot of time into 
here (Annie, most recently - thanks again, Annie!) that would surely be 
invaluable to you.

As far as the question of which server goes, just understand that all the 
"Zek" servers are PvP, just various rule sets. Firiona Vie is the 
"roleplaying" server, though little rp actually goes on there. They limit 
you to one character on that server though. I believe Antonius Bayle is a 
European server, and there may be others.
