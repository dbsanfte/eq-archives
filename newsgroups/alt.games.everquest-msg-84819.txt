    And people would have quit when they realized that they couldn't get any

    Not quite correct. He said he didn't want the head to be farmed for
FSSs, with which the farming guild would then flood the server. The FSS part
can be done without doing the rest of the quest, and Stanos IS triggered by
saying the correct phrase. I don't think he really realized that not only
would few guilds spend hours fighting a really nasty mob and ganking a host
of factions for a weapon they wouldn't personally use, but that by the next
expansion weapons that are BETTER than the FSS would be dropping like
raindrops in Seattle.
