    Go to vendors in zones where the pages would normally drop. At low
levels, I found the High Pass/High Keep area to be excellent for this. The
low-level stuff usually costs 1 or 2 pp each off the vendor, and the blank
pages are only a couple of gold each. Blank pages are great, by the way,
because you get two skill-up attempts off them. One comes when you turn the
blank page into a regular page, and the second comes when you do the normal
combine with the regular page.

    I never mess around with casting specializations. I usually put one
point in each, then put points in the one I want most until it hits 51.

    For a long time some of the items required for practice runes weren't
dropping, so it was even more futile. ;-)

> Are there any no drop research only spells?

    None that I'm aware of. One of the only No Drop spells in the game,
Primal Avatar, was specifically excluded from the new LoY spell research.
And the only other No Drop I can think of off the top of my head, the level
44 Tash-line spell, is quested. BTW, be careful when you go for some of the
pieces in zones you're KOS in. The new Exterminator NPCs are usually between
you and the quest item you need, and they can see invis and hit for a lot
right now. If one of them was near a zoneline when you came through, before
you could re-illusion, you'd be in for a world of hurt.

    No, getting tailoring up to a high level really is crazy and expensive.
Research is easy. I was still getting skill raises every two or three
combines all the way to the 110's, with 210ish INT.
