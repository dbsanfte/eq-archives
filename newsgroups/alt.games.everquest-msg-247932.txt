And to trim the invites, open your team window (assuming you're not on a
team).  If the left button says "Stop Seek", it means that you're currently
in Team-Seaking mode.  Anyone in the area looking for team members will see
your name on a list of people currently looking for a team.  Click it, and
it should switch to "Seek Team", indicating that you are no longer looking
for a team, and free to wander on your own.

If I am running around in team-seek mode, I usually get several invites per
minute.  If I turn that off, I still get one ever now and then, but not
nearly as often.
