They could do that but I'd prefer not to see the game turn into a bunch of 
instanced zones insulating everyone from each other. I didn't like that 
aspect of CoH and I don't really like it in EQ2, either. I play MMOGs to be 
*with* other players, not insulated from them. I'm hoping that there are 
better engineering solutions that can be applied to the networking code to 
make performance more acceptable, and less segregation.
