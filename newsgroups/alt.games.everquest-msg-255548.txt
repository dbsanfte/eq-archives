Well now wait a minute.  Its less than a minute from the GD book.   There's
both a druid and wizard portal to GD.  It's certainly NOT in the middle of
nowhere.   And if you will recall the old world quest almost EVERYONE in the
olden days had a Thurgadin Gate potion.  Even casuals could complete that
quest.  *I* know.  *DO* you remember that Ben?

>It takes one quest that has no chokepoints at all.

Yup, every time I go to shadowhaven and see the 2 or 3 people that might be
there, including me, I realize how great a city it is for the *casuals*.  Cept
for all the twinks that are sitting at the zoneline to PC.

>>But don't let facts get in the way of your religious convictions.
>Another whiney casual? Struck a sore point, didn't I?

Not with me you didn't.  But if you work at it a bit you can blame global
warming and world hunger on the casual players too.  Yell if you need help with
it.
