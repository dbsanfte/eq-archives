Absolutely.  Believe it if you will or not... I don't consider the word
"petty" to have feminine connotations.  I would have - and indeed, in the
past, already have - used the same adjective to describe a male toon's
actions.

You seem to be trying to ascribe a chauvinistic slant to my writing.  If
only you knew me better - I once had a friend describe me as "more feminist
than most women".  I grew up in a household with just my mother and two
sisters - even the dog and cat were female.  My father was a college
professor who taught courses in Human Relations - teaching people not to be
sexist, racist, ageist, and so on.  Believe me, non-chauvinistic behavior
was instilled in me in a very early age.

Mostly this much ado about nothing.  You made an idle speculation about my
behavior without malice.  I'm also saying, without malice, that you are
wrong and I would have responded exactly the same way to a male toon and
used the same words to decribe his behavior in my post.
