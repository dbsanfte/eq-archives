Number 1 lesson for all young rogues to learn is GROUP, Group, group.....

Only while grouping can you use backstab to the extent required to raise
this skill.  Now is the time when you HAVE to meet and group with friends.
Rogues must go out of their way to have as many possible hunting partners as
possible.  I take the time to check my friends list often and fire off a
short "Greetings" to most people I see on.  Always play fair and be polite.

Good luck
