Hehe, good to see that its not only a Veeshan problem with people who want a
port wanna pay half now and half after port.
Happened to me a few times, both times when i was porting to the destination
anyway, so i didnt even bother to discuss with them, if they only wanna pay half
now, i sent them a tell from my destination when i have ported leaving them
behind.
Dont know how that mad idea started. I mean, if you use any mean of travel where
the destination is known beforehand you pay before you go.
