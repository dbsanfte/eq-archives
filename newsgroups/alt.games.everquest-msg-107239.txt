Wah wah wah.  Whatever class you aren't playing must be easy because 
you're such a great player.  Wah wah wah.  Clerics are easy in some 
situations, just like enchanters and monks and warriors and every other 
class.  Big fucking deal.  
Being a cleric is easy.  Just like any other class.  Being a top-notch 
cleric requires at least as much situational awareness as any other class, 
if not more.  The clerics in the big raiding guilds didn't get where they 
are because they put in enough time to hit 60, they got where they are 
because they pay very close attention to every aspect of the encounter, 
and know how to react before the situation is critical.  My guild isn't 
uber, and we turn down more clerics than we accept.  Bad clerics lead to 
wipeouts.  Raiding with other guilds it's pretty fucking obvious what the 
difference is.  Anyone who says that any 60 cleric can be an uberguild 
cleric is shoulder-deep in anus.

Of course they don't have anywhere near the number of utility spells that 
shamans and druids get.  Like damage shields and pets and slows and snares 
and regen and on and on and on.

> 2) they are the only pure caster that wears plate armor.

/shrug  They have a very high probability of drawing aggro, even when they 
do everything perfectly.  An enchanter draws a lot of aggro too, but only 
if they get resisted or the group doesn't work well together.  A cleric 
dropping heals on the puller to keep him alive will draw aggro in almost 
every case.  An enchanter stunning/mezzing only draws aggro when the mez 
is broken improperly.  Nukers can time their nukes.  Other than specific 
high-end, high taunt spells (tashicide), other classes don't generally get 
hit unless someone fucks up.

> 3) they have the most usefull and widest ranging invulnerability spells.

How often do they use it?  I would say that succor is a more useful 
invulnerability spell.  Gate is pretty good too.

You mean their very specific line of nukes, that are strongly biased to 
undead?  The fact that they have a single nuke that is close to as 
effecient as specific druid nuke is as relevant as the fact that your 
greater healing is just as effecient as a cleric's greater healer.

So, druids are the best overall travelers, shaman are the best buffers.  
Both are critical functions that everyone eventually needs.  Other classes 
can do it, just not as well.  See necro and pally resses.

> 7) they have all the fear and all the root spells.

Which have nothing to do with each other.  They don't have snare, and fear 
is all but useless as anything other than emergency CC without snare.  
Fear and root is something only the truly stupid would mix regularly.

Necros have both.  As far as I know wizards don't.  Rogues have it even 
better.

Everyone can solo.  Few can solo effeciently.  A level 60 cleric can solo 
green mobs in Lower Guk easily.  A level 40 cleric is going to have a 
really, really tough time soloing in Lower Guk at all.  A cleric is almost 
impossible to solo from 1 to 60 without serious twinking AND lots and lots 
of time.  How often do clerics quad?  How many blue-con mobs can a cleric 
kill per hour?  Contrast that to a druid.  

You seem to be the only druid who soloed for any reason other than 
personal choice.  Good druids can get groups anywhere.  Most of them bitch 
that group exp is too slow and prefer to solo.  Very few typical group 
classes can *ever* get faster exp solo than grouped.  No typical group 
class can get faster solo exp over their entire career.
