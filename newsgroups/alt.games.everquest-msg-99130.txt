Somebody locked #bazaar on Xev last night, too. At first I thought maybe
it was just an odd choice for a private raiding channel or somesuch, but
now I'm wondering if it wasn't somebody griefing.

Ferrkristsakes, if somebody can create a channel, PW lock it, and leave,
that's BEGGING to be abused. Would it be that tough to just have it set
up so that when the last person leaves, the channel disappears like it
never existed? And when somebody later creates one by the same name it
defaults to the usual "no password", etc.?
