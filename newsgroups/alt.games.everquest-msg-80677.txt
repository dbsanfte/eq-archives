Me, me and me again. My wife and I were on 6 hours yesterday and I was
disconnected at least 8 times. My wifed was disconnected slightly less,
which is weird as we share the same cable connection.  Haven't had a problem
with this until this week.  Frustrating.  You hear me? Frustrating!! Ok, I'm
better now.
