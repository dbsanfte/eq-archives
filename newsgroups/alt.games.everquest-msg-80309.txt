My printer ran outa ink, printing out EQ stuff :-( I have to wait for
a payday till I can get more ink. So for now it's a struggle getting
things in my head, but I can find the guild and the bank :-) Right
now, even though my levels aren't going up fast, I'm working on
skills. Just found a site that shows how to figure your max skill cap
for your level. 

Speaking of skills. I also spent big money, for me anyway, on a large
sewing kit. Serves 2 purposes, one it will hold 8 items,so bank space
is better used. Number 2, I'm hunting spiders for the silk they have,
then make silk thread to increase my sewing skills. This task
according to one source never fails. Now turning the thread into silk
swatches I think takes a little skill, not sure just found the
reciepe, need to look up more on it.
