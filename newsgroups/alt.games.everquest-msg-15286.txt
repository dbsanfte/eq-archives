	Because it's fun?  Because we enjoy it?

	In your humble opinion. of course.

	I played Asheron's Call for 6 months.  I like Asheron's Call.  I
like EQ more, however.

	But I will definitely agree with you that Verant could take a page
or two from Turbine's playbook.  Turbine's open communication channels,
their willingness to admit mistakes, and their willingness to accept that
their players probably know almost as much about the game as they do, made
for a refreshing breath of fresh air after dealing with Verant for so long.

	As you might expect, Turbine gets the same type of whiners that
Verant gets, e.g. the usual assortment of immature crybabies who want
everything *their* way, and they want it their way *now*, and if they don't
get it *their* way, then it's obviously because Turbine is a sack of
uncaring, unprincipled bastards who have it in for their paying customers.

	Whenever I would run across these people bashing Turbine, I just
wanted to grab them, shake them briskly, and say "Christ on a pogo stick,
man, have you no idea how good you have it with Turbine?  Try playing EQ
for six months, under Verant's tight-lipped, players-are-morons policies,
then come back here and tell me that Turbine sucks."

	However, it seems that Verant *is* learning.  I consider them much
more enlightened now than they were when I left EQ 9 months ago.  They've
still got a long way to go IMHO, but progress is visibly being made.

	AB
