I understand the process...rather than go to each server, I am asking
the general community here.

My experience on SolRo and BB at levels 55 and mid 30s has be fairly
positive on both servers. My experience on BB has been a bit better,
regarding helpfulness etc. I have encountered a few toons at mid levels
who did not know how to play the game (a theme that has been echoed in
other threads), but no more than 5%. Now on BB there seems to be a
decent population at lower to higher zones, not like the ghost towns on
SolRo before it closed. And the bazaar hit 571 people last nite...a
nice change of pace!.
