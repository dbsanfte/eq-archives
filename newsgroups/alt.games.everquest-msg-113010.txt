Put all 20 points in STA, it's much easier to raise STR and you'll want
those HP in high levels.  "Best race" really depends on your definition of
"best."  If you want regen, forage, better nightvision, and AC bonus with an
exp penalty, go Iksar.  If you don't, go human.  Purely from the "uber"
perspective, Iksar is better, but it doesn't really matter and you should go
with what you like.  A note on faction, it is highly overrated.  With FD you
can go anywhere on the old world without fear of death.  With my Iksar monk,
I am able to bank in North Freeport and various other goody cities despite
doing absolutely no faction work. You could probably even go to the trainers
in Freeport and Qeynos, but it would be risky since the guildmasters
probably hit for ungodly damage, and if you really need a trainer go to
Shadowhaven or Brother Qwinn in South Karana; both are right off the Nexus
express.  Not only that, but after the nerfing of the "Ally Cabilis faction
in 30 minutes" quest, it's once again far easier to gain faction in good
cities than Cabilis, even though there is really no good reason to do
faction work.
