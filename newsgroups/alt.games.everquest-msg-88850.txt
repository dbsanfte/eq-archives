Last night connection was terrible with people going linkdead all the time.
The odd part is that when I log on with my other account on the same pc,
both with the same settings and all expansions enabled I get a lot less
packet loss.

Ping was still terrible (400+ where it normally is 50-150) but it's the PL
that is really annoying; I just hate not seeing a monster until just before
it attacks you.
