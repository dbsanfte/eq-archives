From the shadows, the mysterious ez064842@veni.ucdavis.edu (Remington

He said "the only way found". He did not say "the only way possible".
Since he then proceeded to bitch out the RZ guilds for only knowing
how to zerg, I thought it might be nice if he showed a better idea.

I don't believe I need advice on how or what to post, but thanks for
the offer.
