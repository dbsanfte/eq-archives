BINGO!

Taken all together, the newbie/lowbie changes that are coming
all seem designed to do one thing -- get people to go out
and explore and take chances, instead of having the possible
risks (losing a corpse, losing a lot of exp, doing a CR solo
down into a dungeon to rejoin your group at level 20, etc.)
so great that players instead tended to huddle in one spot
near a predictable outdoor spawn to grind exp.

Someone on this thread said, basically, "now the newbies
will be able to do stupid stuff with impunity".

Why yes, exactly...  How else do you expect them to
learn?

These changes encourage experimentation, at *exactly*
the levels that people *ought* to be experimenting,
taking chances, trying new ideas...  And not worrying
too much about the downside consequences -- there will
be plenty of time for that later.

There's a new Vision(tm) in town, folks, and it's
"we'd like to encourage you to be adventurous", not
Gynok Moltor's "Grrrraaaaaaughh!!  Suffer as I have!"
