OK, DT, while I totally disagree with him, his original statement on that 
was:

"I believe true homosexuals, meaning those who are born with such
impulses and not those who decide to "experiment" later in life,
either have a serious chemical/hormonal imbalance or some
non-intellectual form of mental retardation.  It is not the human norm
to perform such acts and there must be a physiological reason for this
behavior."

Note that it opens with "I believe".  He is stating what he believes to 
be the case, he is not stating it as absolute fact.
