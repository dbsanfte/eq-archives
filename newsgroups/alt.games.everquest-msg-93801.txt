I too have just got 12.
I think that you need to look at at least 2 different setups.
Solo and Group.

Soloing you are going to want to have your pet up (Duh)
But do you need the spell up all the time ? 

Swap slot for buffs / pet
Choke
Chaotick feedback
Languid Pace
Tash
Mez
A stun spell (colour flux)
either gate or another stun (Whirl till you hurl)

In a group you won't want the pet up I guess that I would go for :

Swap slot
Tash
Mes
Colour flux
Whirl till you hurl
Root
Languid Pace
Gate

How does that sound ?

I'm just guessing as this is my first time as a chanter.
