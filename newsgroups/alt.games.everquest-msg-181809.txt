HGs at 34 are easy.  My 34 druid even brought down the tainted (or
corrupted, whichever comes first) HG.  Took some medding but I did it.  No
KEI, 140 Wis, one or two mana times only.  Of course, I had to run when the
other popped....

One thing to remember is always always get ensnare on them and work to keep
it on them.  I developed a feeling for when it will fade and recast with
plenty of time to deal with resists.  And boy do you get resists when
soloing reds.
