I'd be happy to.  Doesn't make any sense to me, even if it happened to 
miss a few files, why didn't they just put them in the pipeline when 
they figured that out?  I mean, thats how this auto update thing is 
supposed to work, I get fed new files all the time.

And if that wasn't good enough, then why not make a package with just 
the few new files available?  Sure I don't care at the moment, because 
on DSL it only took a few minutes, but plenty of people are on much 
slower connections (including myself 5 months per year) and I don't see 
the sense in forcing a 58meg download when apparantly 99% of that was 
already on my system.


I wasn't trying to point fingers though, I was just trying to tell 
people what was going to happen (which is long over with by now, of course)
