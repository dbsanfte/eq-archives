You will not evade me, "Brat" <brat@portalofevil.com>:

>Is this really the best that the mob could offer?

We don't bother serving up 'the best' for every little troll, you
know.

>1. Did any of you bother to ask how old Matt was?

Why should we care? I know a 16 year old who acts more mature than
some 30 year olds, and vice versa.

>2. Did any of you actually debate the subject at hand with him...or did you
>just see that he used the word "fuck" and piled on like the bottom feeders
>that you are?

Did he ever actually debate the subject at hand other than for a post
or two before shouting to the world that HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT
KILLFILES and attempting to weasel out of the ones he'd been put in,
since he didn't care and all that?

>4. Are any of you going to come to terms that your single sentence responses
>equal, by your own admission, that you LOST the war... (I'm sure I could
>easily dig up the post where someone stated that about Matt).

What war?

>To think I actually came to the rescue of this NG once and rid you of
>someone like Avenger...

*laughs maniacally* Riiight

>Ps. Matt is young...he's also in my guild and I've met him in real life.
>He's got a hot head sometimes but mostly he's a great guy. I'm sure you're
>all damned proud that you could all manage to gather your resources and as
>one huge mob, call him names and repeatedly tell him you have him KF'd. 

Proud? Nah. You see, unlike him, we don't really care. We killfile and
move on, and try to get a few laughs on the way if we can.

>I don't need to use foul language to make you look like complete
>idiots...you've all managed to accomplish this task entirely on your own.

Eye of the beholder and all that.

I'll let you in on a secret: some of us have an ability you don't. We
realize that some of our acquaintances are fully capable of moronic
behaviour and don't try to defend their stupidity at every turn.
