And he said "Having him either camo me so I could  run to the bank or
run to the docks is to much of a hassle. "

Because he thinks the boat takes too long.  And yes, if you aren't KOS
to the tunnels you come out under the dock by the barb fisherman.  At 30
the barb won't agro you, and you can wait for the boat to dock, swim in
the front and be GTG.
