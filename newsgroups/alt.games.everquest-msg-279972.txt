Well, you can download the original EverQuest trilogy from www.everquest.com 
and try it for free for seven days.  That's something Blizzard doesn't 
currently offer.  So you can at least decide if you like the look and feel 
of the game.

A thousand threads have been spawned on this subject, but I'll break it down 
like this:

EQ is hard.  Lots of grinding, lots of repetitiveness, a long, long haul to 
get from level 1 to level 70.  Maybe "hard" is the wrong word; "boring" is 
perhaps the better description.  You need a certain kind of mindset to sit 
for hours in one place gathering XP.

WoW is easy.  You can get very high very quickly with no knowledge of the 
game whatsoever.  The game is very good at leading you along from one area 
to the next, allowing you to explore and build your character all at the 
same time.

EQ is huge.  There have been nine expansions now and a tenth is on the way. 
You can wander endlessly about and not see even a tenth of the world.  The 
sheer amount of content in EQ is staggering; you'll never run out of new 
things to see.

WoW is small.  The world is fairly self-contained.  New expansions are on 
the way to add more to the world, but for now, it's easy to see the whole 
world.

EQ has terrible, terrible PvP.  EQ tried various ways to implement PvP, but 
in the end they couldn't get around the fact that the game was designed for 
PvE, and PvP was only added on due to customer demand.  They tried, but they 
just couldn't get PvP to work effectively.

WoW has terrific PvP.  The classes are well-balanced, and you're not 
automatically at a disadvantage just because you chose to play a certain 
class.  WoW was designed from the ground up with both PvP and PvE in mind, 
and the effort shows.

EQ has lots of end-game content, with extremely challenging mobs that 
require dedicated teamwork from a variety of players.  SOE has had years and 
years to design and implement raid-level challenges, and nobody does it 
better.  Plus there are so many raid-level encounters, so many different 
ways you can progress, it can make your head spin deciding what you want to 
do after you hit level 70.

WoW has very little end-game content.  Blizzard is working on this as we 
speak, of course, but for now, once you get to 60 you have a few instanced 
zones to go to and that's about it.

EQ has an outdated graphics engine.  They've tried updating it over the 
years, but you'll still feel like you're in a five-year-old game much of the 
time.  SOE will release yet another graphics update in the next expansion to 
try and catch the game up.

WoW has a beautiful graphics engine.  Very immersive.  Perhaps not 
HL2-calliber, of course, but still quite lovely.

EQ is a very-slowly-dying game.  SOE recently contracted servers, and now 
have half as many as they used to.  Don't get me wrong, the servers that 
remain have fairly stable populations.  But still, you won't see many true 
newbies anymore.

WoW is still growing, adding more servers around the world.  They have an 
impressive number of subscribers and a thriving community.

So, which game is best for you?  I can't hardly say, I don't know you.  Just 
look around at what people have written and decide for yourself.
