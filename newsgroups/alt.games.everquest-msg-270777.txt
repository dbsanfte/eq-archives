Just wondering, how many of you EQ1 players are thinking of starting
up a new bard (or dusting off their old one) now that they have
implemented the new /melody command?  And are there any people who
play bards who DON'T like the /melody command, and if so, why? (like
maybe you don't like talking to your group members and twisting songs
gave you an excuse not to! ;-) )

Thanks in advance,
