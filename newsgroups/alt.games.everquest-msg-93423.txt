Absolutely flies in the face of polling theory and statistics.  While it 
is possible for a random sampling to produce results totally out of whack 
with the true population, in almost every case the true results are within 
the margin of error.  From the data I've seen that poll is as good as any 
other poll of similar sample size.  
If you seriously believe the following statement:

     There is no way a survey can get an accurate reading unless every 
     person is surveyed.

then you are woefully ignorant about polling and statistics.  

If you want to slag the study, slag the way he chose subjects rather than 
make up something about polls are inaccurate.  
Really, you're smarter than your statement suggests.
