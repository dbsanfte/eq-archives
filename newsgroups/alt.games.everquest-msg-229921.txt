   A kid.  Someone who doesn't realize that others pay the same amount of money
he does to play, and that others are not there just to make life easier for
them.  This sort of player thinks that the game revolves around them.  What do
you want to bet that he doesn't go out of his way to buff others?  

   Ignore him.  And don't worry about his reputation.  It will almost certainly
take care of itself.
