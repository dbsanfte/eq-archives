Does the rule about grammar corrections apply to algebraic corrections as
well?

Well, way back when, when I learned Algebra, we were not particularly
encouraged to over parenthesize.  We were encouraged to learn operator
precedance.  This was back before I started using computers.  And, last time
I checked (X*Y)/(X*Z) = Y/Z which would be incorrect.

Let's try a simple example here

2*(6/3+1) is equivalent to 2*6/3+2*1 is 6.

using your formula

2*(6/3+1) is (2*6)/(2*3)+(2*1) is 4.

Evaluating the original expression, I get 2*(2+1) is 6.

Ideally I would have represented it as

Y
-- + W
Z

which is closer to what it would have looked like on paper, and does not
suffer from the same ambiguity.

Next time I will consider adding in the extra parenthises to reduce
confusion.

Perhaps, had I continued my math studies beyond where I stopped, I would
have gotten to the point where the rules of precedence changed and the
operators had different meanings.  However, we were discussing basic algebra
here.  I will go so far as to admit that it is possible to misinterpret what
I put forward, due to the limitations of putting the formula in ASCII text.
