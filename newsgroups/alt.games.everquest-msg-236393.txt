While we've been focusing on the issue of top-posting in
this thread, *another* "netiquette" convention is to retain
only enough of the prior posts to give context to the current
reply (as I have done above).

Anyone who quotes "the last 4 posts" in their reply will get
flamed almost as badly as top-posters.

Most times it should not be necessary to "scroll through" at *all*,
since the quoted passage should, except in rare special circumstances,
be less than a page in length.
