I levelled largely leisurely.  I started playing in December, 2000, I did 
not hit level 60 until after PoP was released.  I hit 65 a fair while 
after PoP was released, and I hit level 70 about 3 months ago.  I have 
done some stints of purely maximizing xp to level, or get some AA that I 
really wanted, but for the most part, I just went out and had fun, 
exploring various zones.  I have at least visited every single unkeyed, 
noninstanced zone in the game, and most of the keyed/flagged zones as 
well.  I am still working on my VT key once in a while, and am not 
flagged for much of GoD, as my guild has no real plans to grind through 
GoD.  I am not Time flagged yet, but will be in the not too distant 
future, and I do not expect to be Anguish flagged anytime soon.  I have 
my Sleeper's key, Howling Stones key, and Old Sebilis key.  I am 
elemental flagged, including fire, and am earth B flagged.  I have my KT 
flag as well (the easy way, just Tipt required now it seems).

Some of my fondest memories are very similar to the ones you described.  
My first journey through Blackburrow, wherein I fell down into the water, 
and was promptly attacked by the fish down there, and managed to channel 
a gate.  Back then, nightblind, really meant nightblind, even with a 
torch, you could not really see well enough to navigate the passage down 
to Blackburrow from Everfrost.  I remember my first run from Halas to 
Freeport, took me 2 tries to make that successfully.  I remember the 
boats, and yes, I did enjoy them, it made the world seem much larger than 
it does now with the PoK books.

In my mind, Everquest has become a much smaller place, despite the much 
larger number of zones.  I mostly log on only to raid now, as I just 
don't get the same enjoyment I used to out of exploring the content.
