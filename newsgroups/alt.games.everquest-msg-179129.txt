No, he was very clear.  There is no ambiguity there.  To assume that
he didn't mean to say exactly what he wrote would be patronizing, and
therefore insulting.

My point is that it is no more silly than the size of the drives.  And
I 2-box on one machine so I have a number of different EQ directories
anyway.  Once you've got over 4 EQ installations, with plenty of HDD
room remaining, it really doesn't matter much why you're creating
another.  Keep in mind that there are more global settings than auto-
join in your EQ installation.  For example, video settings (including
which new models to use) are also global and I know a number of people
who use much different video settings for raiding than for other play.

Please note that I gave that suggestion in the same post, about an
hour and a half before yours if the times displayed by my newsreader
are to be believed.
