Another risk is training somebody by accident.  I had already pretty
much given up on FoL by the time this problem occurred to me, so it
didn't really factor into my decision.  But there are some mobs that
have very high proximity agro (Sand Giants, Hill Giants, and LOIO
undead mobs spring immediately to mind) and will often go after any
nearby target when they are not already in melee unless you have built
up tons of agro.
I think that last time I found it actually useful was in my teens
soloing in Oasis, where I could flash a croc to buy time for a
few heals (this was so long ago that the "hybrid spellcasting does
not reset melee timer" change had not gone in yet), or flash a
skellie add so I could survive the run to the zone (those skellies
were just plain nasty for untwinked chars in those days).
