Honestly, you don't appear to know enough about European politics to be 
able carry a cogent conversation on the issue. If the matter of calling 
Chirac a "leftist" wasn't enough, using 'socialist' and 'communist' 
interchangeably or pulling some bizarre tax rates out of thin air (for 
what it's worth, my taxes here are no higher than what I was paying in 
California. The EU does not even have a common income tax policy) 
demonstrates that you simply don't know what you are talking about, and 
don't seem interested in learning. 

I'm always up for enlightening political debate (and I've indeed had it, 
with more informed conservatives in this newsgroup), but for ignorant 
name-calling, I'd much rather just subscribe to alt.flame and at least 
enjoy being insulted with some flair.
