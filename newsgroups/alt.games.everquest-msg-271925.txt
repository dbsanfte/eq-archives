The traders that sell only a torch are likely the status merchants -
unless you are in a guild and have enough status points (for some of
them "enough" is, I think, in the hundreds of thousands), all you'll
see is a torch.

The doors may well acquire a purpose later on - for most of the beta
there was only one tradeskill instance per district, then when they
added more, previously unused doors were used for the entrances.
