Unless its more complicated than that, possibly due to when the server
actually considers you to start and stop sitting and standing compared
to when *you* do.

I suspect the experiment, if someone tries it (my account is
deactivated), will show mana not being as high as it would be but not
30-50% lower even if 42 is very fast on the mouse.
