     Novel, if you don't fix the page breaks on your posts, people are
only going to read about the first 80 characters of each line.  And
that's a shame, because so far from what I've seen you show signs of
being reasonably useful and on topic, qualities that are sometimes in
short supply over here.

   Personally, I know that I'm enough of an egotist that I want as many
people as possible to read every word I write, not just what shows on
their screens without having to scroll.  Because people are not going to
scroll.
