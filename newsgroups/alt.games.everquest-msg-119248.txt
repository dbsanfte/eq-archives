Well, for the first time, I've found myself at a loss as to where to go.
After hitting 35, I worked on trade skills for a bit, and killed a few more
of the same old mobs.  That got boring.

I went to FM and killed a few brutes and burynai, but no real xp or loot
worth mention, kinda seems like a waste of time.  I like to solo mostly,
because I play for varying amounts of time, and don't want to irritate a
group by not being there long enough to be effective.

I tried GD, and basically came real close to death on blue MoBs.  Where do I
go now?  Suggestions are appreciated.
