Heh, I remember the first time I ran into that skeleton dragon. I was
running from the Feerott zoneline to the Lake Rathe line and went around the
corner where there used to be those beetles. A bit of lag chopped my frame
and then all of a sudden there is this HUGE pile of bones in front of me. I
just went "WTF?", then got feared and the next sec I saw that dragon and his
sidekick run over me from a top-down perspective....

Really loved that zone during the events. I did do EK, WC and Nro (I think)
just to see the loot and what else had changed, but nothing was as good as
Rathe IMO.

Still wearing the waist item from that event as well.. at lvl 58 :-/
