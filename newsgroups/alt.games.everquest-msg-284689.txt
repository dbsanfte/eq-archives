Most?  You mean, a small few?

Even though these days backflagging is hugely simplified in many cases, 
for example, you can get 85'd into the PoTime and backflagged during 
phase 3.  So, 1-2 hours to get PoTime access if the guild already has 
enough people in the zone to be doing it.

Anguish, if you want to join a guild already in there, you do the 
legwork to get the Signets, and then the guild gets you one drop from 
inside the zone and bingo you're flagged.

I don't know the specifics from GoD, but I'm sure it's roughly the same.

Same in today's EQ, hardcode non-raiders get progression missions with 
varying difficulty, and infact, there are two levels of toughness to the 
missions with varying rewards.  Different people will be able to beat 
70.1 hard and 70.1 normal for example.

WAS. Not IS.  You said you didn't believe the changes, but you speak as 
though you know the truth.
