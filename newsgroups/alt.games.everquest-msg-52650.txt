A Clerics only hope in a duel is to get a root off and it sticks while you
nuke. You cannot hope to win a duel with a melee class in a equal fight
standing toe to toe without getting some spells off. Most of these Idiots
only pick on lower level characters so they can win. I had one 25 warrior
challenge me to a duel while Power leveling my Orge warrior 21 almost 22.
Then started whining that it was no fair as I kicked his butt with my Twink
(Fungi Tunic Sword of Skyfire 10/22 and my Velium Battlehammer 12/20 FBSS
among other things plus 52 Shaman buffs). All they want to do is satisfy
their egos and make them feel like Big Bad Tanks. Another mean trick if you
are not grouped and bored when someone challenges you to a duel go to a safe
spot where he can't find you and then accept. He can no longer be healed or
buffed till the duel is over.
