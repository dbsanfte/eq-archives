I will endeavor to get you the actual figure.

Repeating that it is not trivial does not make your statement true either.

No, I have not, I had my share of problems learning how to play.  Falling 
off of Kelethin platforms, learning how to swim, dying to swarms of wasps 
in Gfay.  I still contend, as I said, compared to what it was like when I 
was a first time newbie, it is trivial now.

You have ZERO risk when you die now up to level 10.  Not limited risk, ZERO 
risk.

Personally, I think that the new method puts new players at a disadvantage 
when they finally hit levels 10 and 11, and all of a sudden dying does 
matter.

You are certainly entitled to your opinion.

You are right, I am not too interested in 1 to 10, so, for me, as an 
experienced player, it's great that it's so trivial now.

I know this is the wrong thing to say in this newsgroup, but we will just 
have to agree to disagree on this subject.  You don't think it's trivial, I 
do.
