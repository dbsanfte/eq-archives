I suspect that your crash was the result and not the cause:

1.  Server-side screwup causes a database error when it happens
    to be accessing your character's data (or perhaps some
    other sort of error prior to its loading of your faction
    table when you enter a new zone).

2.  Server freaks out and terminates your connection, causing
    you to bomb out of the game.

3.  Server attempts to "save" your character, but it already
    has bad (or no) data loaded in its working memory, and thus
    junk (zeros, perhaps) gets written to your character's
    faction offset data record.
