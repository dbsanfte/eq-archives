Well, we were the wierdos...we played D&D, rode bikes because 
they were fun, and we could spend more time hanging out while 
riding, there is a sort of zen to riding=) It also helped that 
Rochester had a great bike trail along the erie canal that nobody 
ever used, so we could 'sneak' from one side of the county to the 
other more or less unseen...we also liked hiking, caving and 
other odd sports.    We had our share of driving, Matthew had a 
car, I had a car so it was the whole hanging out thing.

I can't do a lot of things now with my screwed up back [though I 
was competing in dressage and steeplechasing, and of everything, 
I miss horses the most, to the point it hurts to watch it on 
television.] Other than my injuries, I really don't know what I 
am supposed to feel like being 42 [43 this month] I really dont 
think much differently than when I was 16, I still enjoy the same 
things I did. If I were physically able I would still ride a bike 
and a horse, though I play EQ instead of D&D, and will frequently 
read off my pda or computer instead of a physical book. I worked 
at 16, I would love to have a job right now...I was paying my own 
insurance, car payments, clothing and education [went to a 
private Montessori school, so I had a car to get there as I lived 
in Livingston County, and the school was in Monroe County, so I 
couldn't just get bussed there...] Only real difference is being 
married, though I was getting laid at 16 and had a steady 
boyfriend. But it was the 70s, when drugs and sex were fun and safe=\
