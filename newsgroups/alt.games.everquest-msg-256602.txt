My experience as a warrior suggests that rangers outdamage me easily.  
Basically, if I'm doing nothing special to hold aggro, like, say, 
taunting, and the ranger isn't jolting or turning attack off or screwing 
around, a ranger 3 levels lower than me stole aggro pretty regularly.  And 
I'm pretty sure I was much more heavily twinked.

DPS isn't the primary warrior concern.  Holding aggro is.  Weapons choices 
can easily involve sacrificing DPS in favor of higher aggro, like by, say, 
equipping a BoC.  A ranger can and should be able to outdamage me, because 
I've made choices favoring aggro over DPS.  And that Scions axe is a hell 
of a lot cheaper than a BoC. (/em momentarily dreams of owning a BoC...)

The ultimate example of aggro over DPS is the warriors over on 
steelwarrior, who have tanked LIS and Emp without doing a single point of 
damage...

But to summarize:  I'm pretty sure even a crappy ranger can outdamage a 
midrange warrior, and I'm fine with that.  But if I catch one of you  
hitting taunt, I will get grumbly!  And jolt plz, kkthx.

As for ranger DPS vs. knight classes, I dunno squat.  I suspect a good 
berzerker might give rangers a run for the money though.  And they push 
the mob around less! (Heart) Berz. :)

Ok, I know monks and warriors have Invuln discs that last half as long as 
WS... and yes, warriors get two by 60, that are on the same timer 
(gah).  But what's the rogue one?  I box a rogue occasionally, if one of 
those disc buttons I set up could have bought me 5-10 seconds, it'd be 
great if I'd known that. :)

>So, outside of fights where you need to kite things around with

>the range of, what exactly do you want a ranger for?

They're great for stealing aggro for a second when the cheal would 
otherwise have been a second late. :)  But one ranger can supply all the 
whining about DPS and class imbalance that any raid needs, so from that 
point of view, at least, they don't stack so well.

Ok, seriously, lately it seems like every third raid I go on I hear 'This 
is a ranged fight! No Melee!' And all the rangers snicker while the 
warriors sit on their thumbs.  But we may have faced an unusual ratio of 
aoe rampage stuff lately.  Especially TZ and TZ from the RZ script come to 
mind.  And something or other in Fire...?
