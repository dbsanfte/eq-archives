Likewise in AC 1 - it certainly added tension doing corpse run.

You could lose one bit of your best armour or your favourite weapon but 
eventually it was changed to good items not currently worn/carried; better I 
think.

Some of my best memories were corpse runs either solo, helping other or 
being helped.

Guilds had emergency corpse recovery guys and u could give another player 
permission to loot your corpse and meet up for a grateful return.

It did make solo dungeon crawls a bit of a non starter unless u striped your 
guy first.

Now of course we just find a high lvl guy to grp or use alts )
