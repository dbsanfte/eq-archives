But look at all the spells the druid has to cast. My cleric just stuns,
nukes, stuns, nuke and she is dead. once I hit  44 it was nuke stun nuke and
she was dead. Only saw 2 druids at her camp and they died/zoned. My druid
friends said she wasn't mana efficient for them. In the levels I camped Happ
it was clerics that came there mainly because it was XP and they wanted to
get to planes lvl ASAP. Getting a group is not the problem for clerics its
getting to the groups. Travel is a pain in the arse for clerics. Besides why
travel 3 zones for a group when you can can Happ and its easy fast XP. Why
waste time and go thru the hassle of bad groupps moron pullers etc if you
just want XP. I group for loot or if friends are on, not for xp grind, well
at least at didn't at that lvl, now that I am a bit higher xp grind is
better grouped. Oh and for those other soloing cleric spectres are great xp
too.
