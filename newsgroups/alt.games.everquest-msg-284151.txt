I've just started experimenting with this.

I shrouded as a 10th level Basalisk Berserker and headed to Crushbone.
In short order, i got a few per cents into unlocking the next mob on
the list (scale wolf, i think). I also went up a per cent in AA. Not
after I un-shrouded, but while I was hunting.

Also of note, I collected a whole mess of Crushbone Belts, but turning
them in in Kaladim did not aid in unlocking the next shroud.
