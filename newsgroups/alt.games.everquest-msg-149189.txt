The trouble is, the MT and the enchanter are usually of the same importance.
Both require as many HP and AC as possible and both need to be healed in a
timely manner (obviously "timely" means different things...MT at 30 health,
enchanter at 80 if actively being beat on).  That's why I'm damned sure that
if I'm in a group with the MT (I play a 60 enc), I want a druid there too,
in charge of keeping ME alive.

Clerics who love Cel Heal on casters is the biggest gripe I have.  A cleric
on top of things can usually keep me alive with Divine Light, but more
likely chain-casted Remedies is called for.  Cel Heal will only get me dead
if I have aggro.

A bad enchanter thinks he's a wizard and doesn't buff people or do crowd
control.
A mediocre enchanter will a tolerable amount of CC and keep haste on the
tanks.
A good enchanter will also Aug himself, the cleric, mage, and wizard (AC is
AC, afterall).
