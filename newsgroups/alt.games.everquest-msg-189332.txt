If I read the link correctly, there is collateral damage to druids.

We druids use the pet as a tank when we solo. If half the aggro from the pet
goes to the caster, the mob goes for the druid as soon as we add a dot or a
dd to the pet's attack. No more tank.

Combat becomes kiting with the pet doing damage from the back. If we took
the precaution of snaring the pet before charming, the pet is not doing much
damage because it has to catch up part of the time. If the pet is not
snared, the proposed increase in charm break dependent on magic resistance
gets us. And druids don't have tashani to decrease mr.

There goes the whole charm animal line of spells.
