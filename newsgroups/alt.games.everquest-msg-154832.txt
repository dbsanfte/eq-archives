Verant people used to be active on this newsgroup a long time ago, in
particular Brad McQuaid.

He stopped posting, because every day there would be dozens of new threads
with subjects like "ATTN BRAD", "ATTN VERANT", "VERANT PLZ READ", etc, etc,
most of which were redundant whines.  There were so many that they clogged
up the newsgroup.

I liked having them post here, but it had a very negative effect on the S/N
ratio.  I wouldn't be surprised to know that they are still lurking here,
but I wouldn't count on it either.

If you have any suggestions, the best place to submit them is probably the
Developer's Corner forum at
http://boards.station.sony.com/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi . You probably won't get
a response, and your message will probably not even be posted, but it will
get read.
