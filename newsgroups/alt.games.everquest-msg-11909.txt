Would it be too early to take my just recently turned 18 Iksar shaman
over to Lake of Ill Omen?  I'm under the impression that this zone is
more between 20-30.  Are there any places/mobs that I could solo
safely or would I be better off trying to get in a group/find a
partner (I do quite a bit of soloing)?

And from reading so many posts saying how LOIO really sucks now
because of all the idiots that go there, is it really that bad, or is
it even worse?!  My only experience with LOIO has been fighting in the
newbie zone, and the newbie zone is very nice and quiet; I've usually
either been by myself or else maybe with one or two necros.

Also, is there anything in Warsliks Woods that I could fight safely or
should I wait on going there?  That's another place that I thought was
mainly a 20+ level area (with a small newbie area supposedly, I've
never been in it though).

Thanks in advance,
