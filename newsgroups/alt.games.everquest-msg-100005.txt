It's always funny how this thread crops up from time to time... just to put
in my two cents worth, I don't normally inspect someone (but if I hear
someone spouting-off I like to do just in spite), but from time to time I do
so accidentally (I meant to click on A and instead I clicked on B.... and
now I got some moron screaming at me if I like checking him out). Now that
I've added to the never-ending thread I feel better now... well not really
(kind of like McDonalds.. temporary gratification, but I feel so soiled
afterwards...)
