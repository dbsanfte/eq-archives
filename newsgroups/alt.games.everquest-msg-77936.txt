Well, one assumes that Prima's Official Strategy Guide, branded on the front
cover with both SoE and Prima's logos would be, in at least some respects,
official.  8)

The Prima guides are endorsed by SoE.  Bear in mind, though, that they come
with a "this game is ever-changing" warning.  They're handy references with
a strong newbie focus.  I find them useful to look up some of the numbers
I'm too lazy to crunch on my own, spell lists, etc.  This book is also why
I'm not irked by the "can't med whilst moving or in combat" so-called nerf.
. .  It's right there on page 191 (and makes sense, really)!
