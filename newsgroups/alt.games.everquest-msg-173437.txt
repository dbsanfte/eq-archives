POTG would be much better than either Aego or Rune IV, its duration is just as long as Aego's and it
includes a hefty (to a level 4) regen component.  He'll never take enough damage to care that Aego is
more HP, and there's no component cost to POTG, unlike the other two choices.

KEI will do nothing at all to keep him alive, although it will allow him to reach level 8 faster.
