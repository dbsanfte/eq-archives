Higher ATK (rangers have all kinds of ATK buffs).  Higher dual wield skill. 
Faster weapons.  An ability to dump aggro (jolt) without losing DPS.  Some
of that is mitigated at the high end by gear, but some of it is just
amplified.  Ask a well-equipped 65 ranger's atk, then *try* and find a
non-ranger that can match it.  :)
