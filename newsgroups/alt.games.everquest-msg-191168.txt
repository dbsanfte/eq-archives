    It's mostly used by clerics moving from one place to another. If you get
aggro in transit, root and Atone makes the mob forget it ever saw you. Just
be sure to /assist the mob after you Atone it. Atone doesn't work 100% of
the time, so if you /assist the mob and get yourself you know the mob still
wants to kill you.

fight?

    Some people use it to get rid of unwanted aggro, like that an enchanter
gets after mezzing. I usually leave that task to someone else. As the
primary healer, you're likely too busy healing people to waste time casting
a spell that may or may not work. You also have no idea who the mob will
aggro if Atone does clear its hate list, so it may do more harm than good.

    It is good on pets, though. If you kill a mob with a pet, Atone will
stop the pet from attacking and it will be non-aggro to everyone afterwards.
In some circumstances, you can even cause a mob pet to poof with Atone. ;-)
