Speaking of system requirements for games, I found an interesting link in 
one of the Vanguard forums:

http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/referrer/srtest

They said to choose MS Flight Simulator X as the closest comparable game to 
Vanguard in terms of system requirements, though some have pointed out 
discrepancies in that regard. I just thought it was a useful site.
