Clear as mud. The instancing is, in fact, near the very core of the
problem, and their current incarnation is indeed a mistake.

Since you yourself admit you have very little experience with the
expansion, however, I'm not sure you would be able to understand.

It's possible to do instanced dungeons right, but the way LDoN did it
was not it, and its rapidly declining popularity, *far* faster than
any expansion to date, is fairly strong evidence of such.

Raids are totally irrelevent to the problem of LDoN.

Yes it would. But it's impossible to explain the concept of a "world"
to someone who doesn't really understand the difference between mmorpg
"game" and mmorpg "world".

Like another fellow earlier, you don't want to play a mmorpg. You just
want a single group game with a global chat and auction channel. Lots
of people playing in the same area, but *not necessarily together*,
are one of the greatest things about mmorpgs, and one of the things
you and your ilk are ruining in this one.
