Hi,

I wanted to take a minute to let you know about some pet upgrades that
we've just completed. The changes are fairly significant, and we think
they address a lot of concerns that have been brought up by players.

Here are the changes we've made -

Pets will not attack mesmerized creatures
All pets now think of mesmerized creatures as being dead. Pets will
not break mez, will not attack mesmerized creatures, and will forget
any hate they had towards a mesmerized creature.

In short, if a monster gets mesmerized, your pet will forget about it
and stop attacking it. This is good for all pet classes, and
especially handy for Enchanters, who can now trust their pets to not
break every mez as soon as it lands.

Pets are neutral to monsters
Monsters will not attack your pet first. All monsters see your pet as
a neutral creature, and will leave it alone unless your pet attacks
something. This means if your pet wanders off, it won't bring a train
of monsters back with it. 

Keep in mind, if your pet chases a fleeing monster, other monsters may
still attack it. Your pet is only treated as neutral while it is not
acting in a hostile manner.

Pets no longer take experience in most situations
In the past, pets would take a full share of experience if they did
the most damage to a creature. We've changed this rule as follows -

* Pets take ZERO experience from a creature, unless no player does
damage to that creature. 

* Pets take 75% of the experience from a creature - if no player does
damage to that creature.

This means that your pet takes no experience from you or your group
unless your pet kills a monster with no help from players. As long as
you or your groupmates do damage to a monster, your pet will take ZERO
experience.

Due to the high potential power of dire charmed pets, they will
continue to take a share of the experience. In the worst case, dire
charmed pets will take a full share of experience - this is the same
as it's always been. 

The amount of experience taken by a dire charmed pet scales based on
how much damage the pet does. If the dire charmed pet is doing the
majority of the damage, it's experience share gets larger. If you or
your group are doing reasonable damage to a monster, a dire charmed
pet will not take much experience. The more damage you do, the less
experience a dire charmed pet will take. In most situations, dire
charmed pets will take less experience than they did previously.

As with all pets, if a dire charmed pet does the majority of damage,
and no player does any damage, the dire charmed pet will take 75% of
the experience from the kill. 

Overall, these changes are a significant boost to pet classes. The dev
team has been hard at work on finding and implementing the right
solutions, and we hope you'll enjoy these changes. Thanks for your
patience as caster balancing continues, and thanks for playing.
