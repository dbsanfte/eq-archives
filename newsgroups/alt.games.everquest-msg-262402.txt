Aye, it seems so.  The idea's been in the game already, items like Ornate
patterns, which are droppable, but when turned into the actual armor 
become no drop.

I think its weird, since it doesn't address the problems of farming and 
twinking, where simple No Drop does (to some extent); problems most 
people seem to agree are more pressing than hand me down mudflation

On the other hand, I was just musing the other day over how the No Drop 
but buyable nature of Ornate armor makes ditching my berserker to start 
a new toon less attractive; even though he bought the stuff in the first 
place, he can't give it to the new toon or sell it to generate cash to 
twink the new toon out.

Then I was thinking "so its a cash sink", since I blew tens of thousands 
of pp on the ornate patterns, which I won't get back either when I move 
to a new toon or when I replace the ornate stuff with better.  But it 
isn't, because the cash went to the guys selling the patterns, its still 
in the game.

So the only effect I can see is the one you mention; it stops the items 
from being "hand me down" fodder.
