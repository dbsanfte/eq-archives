You seem to be quite certain that Dex has no effect on tailoring, may I ask
where you got your information, or have you tried lengthy tests yourself.
The 185 value, is pretty vague in the statement made about it.  I have
learned to put a fair amount of trust in the information provided on
eqtraders, it has generally been accurate, and well researched.  The post
that I copied is not just some random post by a user of the board.  If you
have better information, I am certainly quite interested.
