My point is that shaman can make single use items other people
can use to cast spells, which is what you are talking about
with scrolls.  Thus your idea isn't introducing something new
to the game, but rather asking to extend the principle to other
classes.  Perhaps thats a good plan, perhaps not... but the
point itself is pretty hard to dispute
