I definitely recommend the Flayed skin, and harvester since you are
human.  Flayed skin cap is very nice for necro's, with maybe only a few
items better int wise.  The harvester has a permanent effect of
Deadeye.  Infravision and see invis.  don't have to worry about the
spell dropping etc.  Stein of moggok is another nice item since it gives
light equivalent to a greater light stone, and is +10 int.  If you are
able and not sure of difficulty because i don't have characters high
enough yet, is the netted kelp items from Siren's Grotto.  Flayed skin
is cheap in East Commons, most pieces no more than 200pp on Erollisi
marr.

You will want a flowing black robe if you ever plan on getting your duck
stick, but those are always cheap it seems.  Your necro can also benifit
from the same hp rings your warrior wears, because it gives you more hp
to convert into mana.
