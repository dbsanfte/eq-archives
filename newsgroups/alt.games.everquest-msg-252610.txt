Just remember that most of these have required levels to proc, even
the velium weapons.  (20 or 30 or so?)  The better mage summoned
weapons will not proc until fairly high levels.  Perhaps 51 or so. 
Also remember that, I believe, the level that matters is the caster's.
 A level 65 Necro could cast his level 1 pet and it would proc any
Warrior weapon in the game.  But the level 1 Necro could not do the
same with his pet.

Nah, search for "summoned".  They all have it in their name. 
"Summoned: Muzzle of Mardu", "Summoned: Hand of Ixblat",  etc..

Don't you have some charm spells by then?  Duo with a Ranger or Druid.
 Fun, fun, fun!
