ok, three options ..

1) Have a friend let you borrow his EverQuest and Kunark CDs .. Install and
patch. Create your account when you get the key.

2) Have a friend send you the file named EVERQUEST.EXE .. That's all you
*really* need to download everything. I'd suggest you have Cable or better
and a few hours of free time. ;)

3) Wait and suffer.

Option #1 would be the easiest, but only works if you have a friend closeby
with the CDs.
Option #2, like I said, is only feasible if you have a high-speed internet
connection.
Option #3 is what you'll have to do if #1 and #2 don't work out.
