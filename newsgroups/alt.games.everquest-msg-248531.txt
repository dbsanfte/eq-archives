Although I have not played on AB so I cant compare, I have brought up a L41
cleric over the past couple of months on VS and I have never had any
problems getting into a group (usually the opposite). In fact I have also
come across quite a few newbies like myself in my travels which is quite
nice as it means I dont feel entirley stupid when I find people are asking
the same sort of questions. It may be that VS is often picked up as the UK
server since EQ New Dawn is the 'official' UK software and newbies naturally
migrate to VS (I didnt even know that AB was a UK server untill the post
above!).
