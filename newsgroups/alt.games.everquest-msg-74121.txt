um, a place to meet with guildies that was specifically for your guild.  the
layout was specifically designed for your guild.  conceivably have a vendor
/ guild bank there, either player run, etc.

Just a few possiblities.

They have done this in games such as gemstone, where the guilds are more
limited.  conceivably this could happen for  the stronger / uber guilds in
EQ.
Gives a sense of ownership.  Was also thinking customized by GM's, who would
build it (hopefully to preapproved specs of the player(s) involved.

probably added to EQ 2 from the outset.
