Its affected my druid in both warrens and stonebrunt. Essentially when
bored I might go to such totally empty zones and mess around getting
factions or doing quests, except I can't so its part of the content
which is not there for me. My lower chars are of course not druids so
can't get there as easily and the area is just not that great to go to
in any event, I'd simply do it because I can. Looking at these zones
and how they eventually go empty really shows that the code in effect
makes no difference in the long term except to exclude probably the
only people who would bother being there. 

I see a large portion of my enjoyment in EQ being exploration, faction
work, quests, the occasional drop passing through (though I'm far from
a farmer) etc. Trivial combat code would mess all that up while not
making it anymore likely that lower players would be in the areas that
I do such things. In fact often when I do the zones I am in are
totally empty.

When you take it beyond just those two zones, and apply it to other
zones as a whole you really see how much it would change. My druid is
bored, goes into nurga (totally empty zone.. 24/7 ) and gets a burynai
legion gi Bzzzt, can't do that now even though no one else is ever in
there to compete with.  My druid is bored goes into droga and gets the
nature shroud at level 55 she never got to have an okay resist item
without having to pay a lot for it with money she does not have (I'm a
really poor druid farmer.. not good at it at all ;) ) No one else is
even in the zone at all except some guy camping the totem but if there
was trivial combat code.. BZZT can't.

Another great example is some of the drops in kaesora. Even a level 55
character can get totally wasted by the very green stuff in kaesora in
a matter of seconds. NO ONE of an appropriate level to do kaesora and
to get drops from xp getting mobs DOES IT. Its empty like 24/7 of such
groups. Once in a great while one such group might be there yet some
of the items from there are marketable and if higher level players
could not get them they more or less would not exist in the game. 

I don't think the people applauding the code or who say it would not
matter to them are not really thinking about the incredible difference
it would have if implemented server wide or even across the areas of a
new add on. 99.9 percent of the time it would be affecting players in
a bad way and removing content from them while it would only actually
HELP lower player in very rare circumstances. The lower players like
the idea of it but I doubt if most could even name circumstances they
play in day to day where it would improve the game for them. Honestly
overall the trivial combat code would affect the lower players in a
bad way also since they would not be able to have the items they'd buy
from higher players which they themselves would have trouble getting.
