I'm *really* enjoying DAoC at the moment. I don't play it but watching
the forums boil over as the `honeymoon' ends is like some sort of warped
epic drama. I thought DAoC has some tricks up their sleeves to make
a balanced and rewarding RvR game, but it's beginning to look as if that
is not the case.
