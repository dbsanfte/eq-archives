Hi ..

I was keen to log-in after last night's patch as they had supposedly fixed
some of the issues regarding ATI Radeon cards. Sadly though, whereas I did
at least have the *find trader* feature pre-patch but no target ring, I now
have neither!

Anyone using ATI Radeon's seen any improvements after the patch?

Kind regards,

Stevie.
