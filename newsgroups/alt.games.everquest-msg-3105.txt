This is just a cop-out IMHO.  See my referance to pottery that hasnt
been put in a Kiln and fired yet.  You can make a Bowl on the pottery
wheel and put it your bag.  You can open that same bowl up as if you
just purchased it at the Office of the People in North Freeport.  I
havent tried to put anything into one that is in that state though I
will admit but I am assuming if you can open it and SEE the
slots......You can fill them.  Now put that item in the kiln with the
firing sheet and now all of a sudden the item is no longer able to go
into a bag?

Before it was fired in the kiln, the game engine didnt recognize it as
a "container" then is what you are saying that Verant would have said,
after firing it IS labeled as a container and "containers cant go into
containers".

So the simple thing, since it is simply a matter of redifining whether
a quiver is a "container" like the the fired bowl or not a "container"
like the UNfired bowl, is to change the way the game engine VIEWS the
quiver.

The only thing I could see is that IF you CANT put items into the
slots you can SEE on the unfired bowl, then I could kinda see thier
arguement that although it APPEARS to be a container, you cant
actually put anything in it.

At which point my theory goes right out the wall=)
