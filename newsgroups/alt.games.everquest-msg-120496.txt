Ok I thought I understood the naming rules but last night I met someone who
had just had their name changed.  He was very upset and I couldn't really
get coherent answers from him but aparently his name was changed from
Greatjester because it was a two-word name and this was not acceptable.
His name was changed by the GM to Geajeser which of course is a really
stupid name.  This same GM was still standing around when I joined the group
and I was looking at her closely because I have just installed Luclin and
she looked cool.  Anyway I was lucky she did not notice that my name was
also two words.  Seefar as in See+Far.  I lucked out.  I sure wouldn't want
to be called Seear or Sefar.  Just doesn't have the same ring to it.

I didn't know that two-word names were no no's.  I could  understand if the
name were not in context as in Footballhead or Stungun, or if it were vulgar
or implied something vulgar like Hunglow or Spreadlegs, but Greatjester
seems to me to be a nice roleplay game.  Am I missing something? I am
confused because I see a lot of two-word names.  One of the people who posts
here a lot has all of her characters start with the word Tea.  I am also
reminded of the article in which Curt Shilling admitted to playing EQ.  His
character was named Scythehands.   Is there perhaps some other reason this
name was changed?  I sure would like to know before I end up with some
really awful name.

Any ideas?
