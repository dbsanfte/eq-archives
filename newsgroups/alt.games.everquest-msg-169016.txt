My first impulse when any cleric usable weapon drops is to assume that its utter
crap.

Epic for raids and any time I'm certain I'm not going to melee, summoned hammer
in a fight... there's little chance I'm ever going to need anything but these
two weapons.  Sadly, even the summoned hammer line lost interest after level 60,
and its epic all the time nowadays.

Thing is, the summoned weapons proc a LOT.  So the fact that we are piss poor
fighters who have low attack values and no dual attack was made up for to some
extent by a steady flow of non resistable yet low aggro procs.

Other weapons, even if they have better stats on the surface, well, we weild
them just as poorly, 10 or 20 percent improvement in melee damage output means
little when your damage output is in the 20 DPS area.  They proc so rarely that
there are hardly any effects that would be of interest.

A hate reducer that procs a couple times a fight, but requires that you stand
there and swing away... well swinging generates aggro, and being close generates
aggro... it would have to proc like a summoned hammer for this to work out at
all!

One weapon I've heard of that might be interesting is Blackstar, which
apparantly procs a group heal.  If you can get your dex up (I can easily have a
dex of 273 if I want it for a fight) that might proc enough to be worth giving
up 10 mana a tick (get off the horse and keep using Yaulp V) particularly if you
have Divine Arbitration...

But by and large, I've yet to see any other weapon that wouldn't be beat hands
down by either epic or summon.
