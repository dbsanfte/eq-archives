Yes, I'm already having people run up to me and ask "can you sow?"  I'm 
tempted to just say "no" and walk away :) but I stay good (obPoing) and 
tell them I haven't got it yet.  A'course, if they run off without even a 
"okay, thanks" I also don't give em the *other* buffs I was thinking of 
giving them when I saw them running up... >:)  It is fun to be able to 
give buffs instead of always receiving them, though.  I like hanging out 
at the POD and newbie lifts in Kelethin and random-buffing and -healing.  
A'course with the low-level heal spell I have, anything over level 4 is 
hardly worth healing :/
