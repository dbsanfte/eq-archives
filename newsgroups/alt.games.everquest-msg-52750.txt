And not every raid is an uber guild all with necros of corpse summoning
level either.  Kaesora and Droga both are listed as being around level
35.  The first summon corpse spell isn't until 39.  Plus believe it or
not, not every guild out there has a necro in it, etc.  Sorry to burst
your little bubble of uberness, but other people play the game too.  One
way dungeons are a hassle.  It is why with the exception of Seblis from
the ones mentioned they are generally empty also.  Seblis is not empty
because you are much more apt to have necro's of a level to summon a
corpse considering it's a 50+ dungeon.

I do tend to agree if you know you will be raiding somewhere on an X
hour raid, you should only commit if you can be there for X hours. 
Emergencies happen etc. but it is a hassle for everyone involved and can
often lead to party wipe outs etc.  To get one person out, or the rest
back in if you don't have a wizard to TL.
