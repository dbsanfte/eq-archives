This will probably draw the usual debate from folks, but as far as I can tell,
FD powerleveling was nerfed some time back.  Now, if you do more than half the
damage and FD, it looks like you get the kill. At least that was the experience
we had with a couple of guildmates who couldn't get it to work anymore. Haven't
tried with my monk yet, as I don't tend to PL people. (Most of them are way
higher than me. he he he.)
