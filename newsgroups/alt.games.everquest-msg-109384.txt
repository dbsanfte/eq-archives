    The portal spells all go to dock locations. At this point in time it's
theorized they're doing away with the boats. Given how folks don't like
riding the boat and the boats actually cause a fair number of CS hassles,
I'm not surprised if that's what they do. I'll miss seeing the boats arrive,
though - they really are neat the first time you take one. The FIRST time.

    The "prayer" spells are self-only gates to various home temples. The
Prayer to Brell, for example, plops you down in the middle of the Kaladim
cleric's guild. If these are put on tradeskill items I'll be VERY happy -
it's a nice reward for folks who not only picked a religion but stayed
non-KOS to that religion (unlike Tunare worshippers who kill in PoG, for
example). Most of my characters are Agnostic, but the ones that aren't will
benefit.

    So GET SKILLING UP NOW!!! The adjustments will be to LOWER the trivials
on many of the standard items now available, to leave room for the new
stuff. Right now, for example, you can skill up to 242 skill on Fine Steel
Plate Cloaks. There's no point in putting "good stuff" at skill 250, because
someone who skills up on cloaks can make the "good stuff" with a good chance
of success. But if you lower the trivial on cloaks to 190, then someone who
can make those 250-skill goodies will have invested a lot more time and is
"more deserving".

    When trivial levels are lowered, everyone's skills remain the same. This
happened a long, long time ago with Tailoring, when trivials were lowered
and some people had tailoring skills higher than could be attained in game.
So if you want to be able to make the new, better recipes when they go in
game you'd best skill up like a fiend NOW before the easy routes to skill up
are removed.

> bout time they made the skills updated and more worth while.

    The tradeskills in game already have a ton of uses - I get asked to do
stuff for the guild fairly often. What they don't have is the money-making
aspect people seem to be looking for in them. Given how many high-skill
characters are out there thanks to the Shawl quests, there'll never be much
money except on stuff with rare components - too many people can make
whatever it is you want to make, and they'll flood the market in short
order.
