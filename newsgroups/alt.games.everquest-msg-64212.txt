I Just Noticed this one......On The Jewel Case That Contains The 3 discs, On
The Back It States:

Internet Connection Required
Additional Online fees Required
ADDITIONAL LUCLIN SURCHARGE REQUIRED


now this is amazingly missing from the outside of the box the game comes
in......

so basically we all agreed to pay MORE per month for luclin...

I could find no info at everquest.com.....my guess is it will match DAoC's
12.95 per month


Wish I Knew This Prior To Buying This Game, Seeing As How It Is Now
Unreturnable....
