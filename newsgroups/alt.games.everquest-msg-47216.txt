Yeah. It doesn't make a hell of a lot of sense if you stare at it too
long. <g> However recently one of the regular posters here (/em waves at
Dan) conducted some experiements taking multiple characters of various
levels, classes, swimming skills, and stamina and threw them all in a
lake. (he he... really no better way to put it.) People with high
swimming skills certainly can swim *far* faster, and have greater
maneuverability in the water, but the "time to drown" for a level one of
a given class with zero swim ability and a level fifty-something with a
200 swim skill were exactly the same. However, the same test on a
character with a base stamina vs. with a ton of gear, etc. to get the
stamina well above 100 resulted in the high stamina person having a
"time to drown" of nearly double that of the base stamina character. As
I recall the specifics of the tests, a whole variety of different
factors were compared, and the only one that had any effect on how long
you could hold your breath was Stamina.
  Makes me pretty happy about my Troll Warrior in underwater battle
scenarios. :-)  Stamina is well over 100 and swimming maxed at 200.
