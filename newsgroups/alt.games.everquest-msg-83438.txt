Duels only have 3 minute timer on the corpse.  Has been this way for a 
long, long time now.

No, you were already 1:57 past the timer.

He was a Guide, and didn't know any better.  A GM probably would have 
beaten you with his Hammmer of Clue Imparting.

Nope, working as intended.  (It is intended to make it at least painful 
to get out of places like VP.  Otherwise you could just zone in to kill 
racnors for exp, then when you're ready to leave, duel to leave a corpse, 
then duel at bind, get clicked in both places with no exp loss.)
