Huh?  Why would it?  It's not like you were nasty.

I know 3 marriages PERSONALLY, so far, that have broken up because of the
spouse's inability to spend less time on the game and more time dealing with
the problems in their marriages instead of escaping into the game and
avoiding their responsibilities to that union.

I personally know of 2 marriages that broke up despite husband & wife
playing, but that marriage was very obviously shaky before either started to
play.  EQ was their last hope, actually.  Unfortunately the women decided
that their in-game spouse should be someone other than their RL husband. In
one of those cases her in-game hubby became her RL hubby after she kicked
the first one out.  That particular case the woman is 27 or so...well, I
really should say "girl."  Two kids and she still hasn't gotten a clue that
it's time to grow up.

BTW, I'm not bitter, I haven't lost a relationship, nor am I in danger of
losing one, due to EQ in any way.  I don't have one to lose. :)  But whether
or not I play EQ isn't likely to have much affect on my life...I had no life
BEFORE playing. :p   Eh, so if I sound bitter it's probably because of envy
of people with lives that throw it away because they aren't mature enough to
put their RL before a silly game.
