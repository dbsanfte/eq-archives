It needs to be said that the other guys here have a lot more *actual*
experience than I do, so you should listen harder to their strategies than
mine.

My basic idea was a solo cleric using IVU to get past the undead and
Pacify + root/atone to get past the summoned MOBs. To get past the final
MOBs, either everybody IVUs or everybody goes to the safe area near the
bottom of the final big ramp, mage deliberately dies (duel?), cleric
Improved IVUs and drags corpse in and rezzes. Mage then CoHs everybody
else in.

Another variation has the cleric using Improved IVU to scout then Pacify
to calm MOBs while the raid streams in.

However, I've never been all the way to the shaman epic MOB myself(*) so
some of this is guesswork - there may not be room enough to Pacify. Plus,
since the only caster class I've played much is cleric, I tend to think
in terms of cleric abilities when planning strategy.

        ...Ronny

(*) I've been on two Hole raids - one wiped going into that final building,
and in the other I was in the group that was left behind and wiped (had
about 6 adds).
