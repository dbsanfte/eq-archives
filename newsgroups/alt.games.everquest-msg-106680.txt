Oh I believe you. Somehow the misconception has arisen that only a
tank-healer-crowdcontrol group has any chance of survival. Being an off
class I often don't get into groups like that (another misconception, who
says mages are crap in exp groups?). Now after 56 levels I must say that the
"standard" group is reasonably safe but not even close to being "best",
"most efficient" or even "fun".

"Odd" combo's which use aggro-kiting, ping pong, fear-kite, pet-tank, etc,
are usually a lot more efficient, safer (who needs a healer when the mob is
feared, pets taking the hits or dots are doing the damage) and generally
lets players use more of their chracters skills and abilities than the
standard groups.
In dungeons the groups are a wee bit more limited because of limited room to
fight. Here a healer is handy, but pet-tank tactics or even root-dot-nuke
works wonders.

And don't forget PBAE groups are THE best exp groups and tank-classes are
the exp-leechers there:)
