I think y'all are a wee confused.

You need the porting stone as a spell component for the wizzie to use to 
take you to Hate. They used to cost just over 100pp each, but I've heard 
that the price has come down. They are called Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk.

The only ways to enter Hate are via the wizzie casting the spell for 
you, or to be rezzed in. So hope the cleric doesn't die. You can camp 
out and in too.
