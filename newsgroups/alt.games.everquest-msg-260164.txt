I'm curious what your alternative would be.

At the very least WoWs ruleset enforces what eqs CS would do.

Neither game enforces the pnp that -players- have more or less 
established. But I don't see how WoWs setup will prevent that player 
made pnp from manifesting.

If EQ CS was everpresent instead of sporadic, is it your contention that 
the players would not respect camps, and would degrade to hit-first kill 
stealling knowing they could rely on EQ CS to enforce it?

To me at least, your implication was that WoW's bottom feeding quest 
system was a phenomena aggravated by WoWs setup.

I agree that its a problem in EQ and other MMOGs that WoW hasn't seen 
fit to address, and perhaps it deserves some criticism for that. But as 
I said, your particular phrasing seemed suggestive: "... this quest 
system seems to encourage some bottomfeeding..." suggests that you think 
the other quest systems do not.

To what end? That DAoC derives from EQ really has no bearing on why no 
one has tried to further derive from DAoC.
