That statement rather begs the question, unless of course you have
decided to adopt the adolescent "kill it to find out what it's for"
and "it wouldn't be in the game if they didn't mean for us to kill it"
attitudes of the d00ds you love so dearly.  But, just for the sake
of argument...

Faeries are non-agro, at least to all the "goodguys".  In fact, their
default con is amiable to every elf or half-elf char I've ever checked
them with.  Also, they give at least one Ranger quest (and Rangers
need a bar of ronium for the Ivy Boots).  And, other than the
bloodyminded high priestess of the dwarves, I've never encountered any
NPC who even implied that they're "guilty" of anything (actually I
don't recall her saying anything about the Faeries, she just demands
Faerie Dust).


It's too bad they didn't have Gnome Paladins back when people actually
did the Ro quests, since one of the components of ronium is dropped
only by Gnome constructs that give a bad faction hit with the Gnome
king.

Of course, if you simply take the view that all EQ "religions" are
bloodyminded and evil it all gets much simpler, tho the role-play
becomes rather one-dimensional.  This view does fit nicely with the
faction system that allows you to repeatedly cycle between ally and
KOS with no lasting effect from repeated betrayals (excepting the
very few unraisable factions, which mostly don't matter for squat).
