Sense adding PoP to my system, I've noticed the wolves are multi colored.
Also noticed some of the skele's I've seen have shoes or something on. Is
there something I need to delete and let EQ build back up on startup or
what? Other than having wolves that look like fruit loops the game is
running fine. Thanks for any help on this.
