I know it depends on the connections in between, but there are usually less
connection between me and CA than me an overseas.  I was playing on the Kane
Bayle(sp?) server, and the ping seemed to be high (which makes sense to me,
since someone replied that it was in Holland or something)...that's why I
asked.  Most Texas sites are extremely fast, so I just wanted to make sure I
was getting on the fastest one for my location...EQ's Zadskjfhadjai server
(I know it starts with a Z...and that's all), seems to be faster.  Didn't
know if I could ping the servers to see which one is best for me.

Thanks for the info,

JD
