You shouldn't have much trouble finding a group with either of those
classes...especially cleric, I'm always looking for a good healer.

I usually just log in and find a group, but the more you play you
start grouping with the same people more and more, mainly because the
same people are usually on at the same times everyday, plus if given a
choice between someone I know is a good player and someone I've never
grouped with, I'll take the known good player.
