after 40 levels of having SoW, I've developed a sixth sense. When someone I
don't know stands in front of me, I instantly stand up and SoW them, usually
before they even finish typing the question. There have been a few cases
where their question was if I would port them or not, but kinda rare. =)
I've been declining donations since level 15 for SoWs. (Except for Breeze,
Clarity, C2 of course .. who wouldn't? ;)
