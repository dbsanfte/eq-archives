Yeah, that's what I eventually did -- I gave someone of
sufficient level (that I did not think would rip me for
the plat) 15pp and told them that they could keep the
change.  I have my spell (and new pet) now, so I'm happy.

I just wanted to see if anyone has some "magical" insight
into what I was supposed to do if I did not choose to pay
someone to get it for me...

Anyway, thanks for the tips everyone...

Mike
