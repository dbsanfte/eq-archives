Heh. Just think about how much time you saved him. Hmm how long
would it take to walk to the arena from DL? =)

Those nice little bonus ports make up for all the stiffs you get so
it all evens out. Things I have gotten for a port: Various  spells
including Ice Comet!, Various pieces of dropped armor, fine steel(hey
its money to me hehe), Large amounts of cash like 500pp for a single port,
gems like you I got a blue diamond once, a couple decent quest items like
the plans for the kilij, rare tailoring pelts like cobalt drake.

I have gotten some junk to but half the time its usually weekend warrior
players that don't have the time to go sell every 'little' thing they pick up
especially if they can't gate.
