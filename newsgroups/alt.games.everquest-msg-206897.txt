Swirling Mist - uncommon drop off of Air and Mist elementals - is a quarter
of the ingredients for high elven Moonlight Temper.  A stack or so is all
that stands between my bard and a full set of Full Mithril Plate - the best
armor he'll likely ever see.  Right now I'm farming it in Najena; there's a
spot where four elementals spawn, of any type.  Right now I'm getting about
one SM every hour to hour and a half.  I've heard that the elementals can
spawn in Steamfont as well, but I've never found any there.  Does anyone
know another place where Swirling Mist can drop?
