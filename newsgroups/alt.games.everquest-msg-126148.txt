Yep, I _believe_ (and I could be wrong, I don't
have a bard) this is a side effect for bards only.
Something about being able to "cast" while
running allows you to be able to right-click items
on the move, too.  When my alt rogue goes to
re-buff (she actually has more right-clicky stuff
than my main), she usually ends up frozen in
place for about a minute or so, to rebuff STR,
Turtle Skin, Ultravision, Jboots, Grim Aura,
and Erudite illusion.

Thant's not including if she has to heal, which
is 6 seconds for each 90 pt heal all the way to
full.

If I had a better connection, I'd try a bard.
I think they're one of the "omg" classes still
left in the game, followed only by the original
necro that got FD nerfed by soloing the Ghoul
Lord's room pre-Kunark when it was one of
the toughest "breaks" in the game...
