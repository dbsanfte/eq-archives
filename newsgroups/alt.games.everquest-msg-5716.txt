An interesting analogy.

I worked as a bouncer for several years in Ventura, CA and Las Vegas, NV.  I
found that if troublemakers were to come into the place and start acting up,
they would be removed by the bouncers, not the bar populous.  If the
bouncers were to get a report of someone acting up, they would be warned
first, then removed if the activity didn't cease.  The problem with the
association is that the bar scene is determined by whether or not the
business would suffer if the offender were to remain.  This news forum is
able to ignore troublesome posters with no impact on the business aspect of
the software.

My entire point, once again, was the selective reporting going on.  If Zeppo
were reported to his ISP for doing the same thing Frisch did later, only
Frisch weren't reported, it's hypocrisy.
