I can remember in D&D when druids couldnt resurrect a player the way
a cleric could but could cast a Reincarnate. The GM would roll the dice
and consult a table to find out what form a player would return in. We
never used the spell but I thought it would be funny to make someone
return as a skunk, opossum, rabbit or armadillo. In EQ it could be similar
to a time when players could be mobs like a giant rat or snake and attack
other players.
