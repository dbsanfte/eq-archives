It's not a "must have", but I can think of at least one reason
it would be very nice: LDoN merchants.

My monk has mostly soloed, plus a bit of duoing (which often leads
to a pickup group, but that's never been in an LDoN area).  He's
too old to use the tutorial, so his Charm slot sits unused.  I'd
really like to get an LDoN charm, but so far I've only found the
time for one LDoN.  (And it was a totally chaotic zerg-fest with
people who wouldn't take the time to explain anything to me even
though I told them it was my first, so even though it successful,
I wasn't left chomping at the bit to try another.  I'm sure I
will some day, but meanwhile the LDoN merchant items are out of
my reach.)
