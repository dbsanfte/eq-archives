As you said in another post, Halflings can't wear Gnome Skin.
Do NOT sell the fading shadow/crystal shadow daggers, they can be purified
into 3svAll/cha or 5Sv all/cha range slot items through the stonebrunt
quest.

The skellies don't see through my Superior Camo, I don't know whats up with
that

I believe the no drop shadow armor when purified can be worn by Halflings
also, can't check this because Allakhazam's pages on the purified armor are
down.  Anyways, the helm and tunic has wis on it and IS druid usable after
purification.
