One of the issues about addiction, is not just the temptation, but the fact
that a person must show self control.  Gambling and Alcohol Drinking are
two things that people get addicted to, but does not have a literal hold on
you versus drug addiction or smoking.  Gambling and Alcohol requires the
person's self will and self control, just as Television boob-tubing
requires you not to watch that Football game you want to see if you were to
spend quality time with a friend or love one, or do that critical paper you
need for school.

Notice that Gambling and Alcoholic Beverages do not say "Warning -
Participating in this can be addictive."  People gamble all the time.
Gambling Addicts gamble because they believe they have a chance to beat the
system...  But ever notice for the California Lotto, they tell you to "Play
Responsibly"?  Or at least, any gambling type thing, they recommend that
you play responsible.  That is plain common sense.  They don't go around
saying: "Warning - You could go into debt" for Gambling...  It is common
sense that you can and often times do go into debt trying to gamble if you
aren't careful.  You see commercials for beer telling you to "Drink
Responsibly", notice it isn't a warning, but appealing to common sense
again.

In both cases, no warning, an appeal to common sense.  It means people
actually have to 'think' for themselves and realize, hmmm...  I should play
responsibly as well.  Look at EQ as a whole...  There are jack off players
who play like it is their own playground and people get upset when someone
scams or kill steal from one another.  Common sense suggests people
shouldn't jack other players, but notice how well that goes.  Hell, notice
some of the bad names that seem to get by from time to time...  Common
sense would suggest people bother reading the policies and such, but notice
people seem to ignore this and wank about every little thing.

So...  You are saying... We are all sheep, we need to be told a game is
addictive, and we need to be told things are bad for us.  It is not our
fault we are mindless idiots.  I am sorry, but that won't float for too
long.  I have a ticket for not wearing a seatbelt back in 1992, when I
didn't know that wearing a seatbelt is mandatory.  I still had to pay for
it.  It is MY fault for not knowing better.  The excuse of 'not knowing
what you are getting into' isn't going to float anymore.  If you don't have
some common sense, and you have no self-control...  You suffer the
consequences of your actions.  Everything you do is a result of your own
decisions.  If you are unwilling to see you need help, or unwilling to do
something, it is just as much as a crime as you accuse of the perpetrator
of doing to you.

The mother saw the signs, did nothing.  The mother wants Sony to do
something about it, how is that any better than doing nothing after the
fact?  She said as much in the article, and thinks that her 21 year old son
didn't need help, then she is as bad as a mother denying the fact her son
is an alcoholic, or a gambling addict.  She did not help in the situation
and does not have the right to expect others to do something she could have
done to begin with.
