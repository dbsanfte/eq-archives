I didn't say any life was "worth" more than another, I said I "care" more
for the Balinese than for the Australians.

So, as for trying to put objectional words in my mouth consider yourself
having been told the obligatory diatribe containing the containing multiple
instances of the words "fuckwit", "shithead" and my new favourite
"fucktard".

The Australians there ignored a government warning about the potential
dangers travelling to Indonesia whilst the Balinese were just trying to eke
out a measly living. The surviving Aussies are getting airlifted to first
world class hospitals, will receive sick pay (if working) and if needed long
term disability pensions.

The Balinese are basically screwed.

Yet if I turn on my TV I am confronted with Sept 11 style media hype which I
have yet to see once acknowledge that any locals would have been affected.
