Nothing to do with your assertions, but I think you're guilty of 
multiple uses of the word "party" here.

Party can mean group, or it can mean something more general, an entity 
which could be one person or several.

"each party involved" means the entities in the killsteal incident, 
which could be individuals or groups or whole raid forces.

"soloers more than parties" uses the "group" meaning of "parties"... 
because it would be nonsensical to say "entities rather than entities"
