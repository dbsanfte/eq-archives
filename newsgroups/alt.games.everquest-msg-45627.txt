Well, me and my happy druid just made level 24, got all the spells,
including the self port to Dreadlands. (Bet you can see where this is
going...)
So I figure I'll do a little exploring, having fun with wolf form and what
not.

Gate to Dreadlands.  "Wow, this place is cool looking."
Run through the tunnel to the rest of the zone.   Tunnel seems buggy, no big
deal.
Come out, see many things that are very red and want me dead, hmm....
Gorenaire shouts something about defying the will of Veeshan, ok, this isn't
good.
Gorenaire uhh.... gorenaires me.  Loading... Please wait...
YOU have lost a level .  eek.
3 seconds as a naked wood elf.
a_guy_01:"Could I get a SoW please. =)"
me: " Are you on good terms with Gorenaire?"

oh

my

god.

So, What's the secret to getting your corpse back from the clutches of a big
angry dragon?
