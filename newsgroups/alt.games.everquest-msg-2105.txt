Last night, a magician was celebrating her new
29th level spells (and practicing her conjuration)
by summoning all sorts of things for people for
free. One item caught my attention: a summoned
coldstone which granted ultravision. Received one
and WOW! This has got to be the very best way to
see in the dark.

My question is, is it possible to find items with
this effect that are not no rent? I would love to
have a stone or (much better) a jewelry item that
granted this. How rare are the items, what would
be a common price to buy one, what mob drops them
and when could a druid reasonably expect to solo
such a mob? Or at least, are there any spells
which grant ultravision available to either an
enchanter or a druid?
