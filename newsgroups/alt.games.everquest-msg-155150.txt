****Calls for injured Balinese to be treated in Australia****
The plight of Balinese people coping with the aftermath of the bomb blasts
is coming to greater attention in Australia.

The majority of foreigners needing urgent medical attention have been
airlifted out of Bali and there are now calls for similar assistance to the
most badly injured Balinese.

A Bali resident has spent the days since the blast tending to injured locals
and families looking for loved ones.

"We focus on local people because most of the Westerners are already
evacuated," he said.

In Australia, talk has also started to encompass the needs of the Balinese,
with radio talkback callers this morning pledging assistance and the Red
Cross considering setting up an official relief fund.

Bali resident Petra Schneider coordinates a support team for locals and
welcomes the offers.

"[We need] donations of water, food linen and there's a lack of burn
medicine," she said.

She also says the most critically injured Balinese are inquiring about
possible airlifts to Australia.
