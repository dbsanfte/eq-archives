Hello all,
I have just recently heard about EQ, and it sounds like an awesome game. I
am definitely considering buying the game sometime soon.
I'm sure you have all heard this question millions of times before, so
sorry.
But what, in your opinion, are the best race/classes for a new person to
start out using, and to learn the game with? Having played many RPG's
before, I have found that mages are more difficult at low lvls, while
warriors have it easier. Should I go with some form of melee character then?
Thanx for any responses. A url link for a site with lots of info would be
much appreciated as well.
Chaos
