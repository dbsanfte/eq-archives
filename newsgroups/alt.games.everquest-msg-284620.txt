Because of the recent thread about what levels con green/LB/DB, I decided
to try gathering data at more levels.  I had a characters at different
levels than when I researched the question previously, and the results I
found at those levels didn't quite fit the formula I'd worked out.  What's
more, in some cases it was high, and in others it was low.  I decided I
need more data.

Now, the simplest thing would be if folks who already have characters at
various levels would email me some data, things like:

   at level 57, 36 is green, 37 and 41 are light blue, 42 is dark blue

(I've only got a scattering of levels covered so far, from 14 to 63.)
The Bazaar, especially late at night, is a fine place to find people at
various levels, since you don't even need tracking to locate most of them.

But in the meantime, I figured I could get some more numbers myself if I
could get characters at some of the levels I'm missing.  So my plan was
to take a level 63 character and kill him off enough to drop levels, and
pause at each level to con various known player levels.  When I was done
I'd use Expedient Recovery to rez all the corpses (after taking what
ought to be a spectacular screenshot).  My primary account doesn't have
enough years on it for that reward, but the second account I inherited
from a friend does, so I'd use my two-boxed 63 cleric as the guinea pig.

Since I would need to do everything before the first rez timer expired,
I figured I wanted a place where: (1) I could bind the cleric, (2) he
wouldn't be KOS, (3) he could get himself killed very quickly (one-shot
by a previously amiable mob, or death by falling).  Oh, and my druid
shouldn't be KOS either, since she'd need to bind in the same spot and
be ready to reapply Eagle and whisk him to the Bazaar at each new level.

My first try was the top of the big spires in Dreadlands.  Even my monk
with 200 safe fall dies when he jumps from those.  Alas, the cleric can't
be bound there.  "Try a city."  Hmmph.

No problem, sez I.  I know from other experiments years ago (measuring
hp regen, as I recall) that it's possible to die from jumping down the
full length of the elevator shaft in the PoK library.  So off I go and
bind up at the top.  But no!  It appears there's been a change, and you
can no longer kill yourself that way.  Jumping down the elevator does
no damage at all.

My next try was Kelethin.  Yes, jumping off the platforms still does
damage, but I couldn't find one that does 20K for insta-death, and I
survive anything less.

All right, guess it's time to involve an NPC.  The Rogue GM in Kelethin
was a nice bright red, so I turn my back to her and throw a small nuke.
"Your spell did not take hold."  I try meleeing (figure I can turn my
back); "attack is on" but there's no attacking happening.  Jump down and
find the Priest of Discord, who I know I've seen people fighting.  Nope,
can't attack him either.

So it looks like the guards and other NPCs in starting cities have been
nerfed to be unattackable?  That makes it harder.  I considered Cabilis,
but that breaks condition #2.  I'd really like to NOT be KOS, else if the
guards happen to get too close to my bind spot I could be in a true death
loop.  I'm also not sure how quickly the guards would take me down; I
think they're only level 50 there.  So I can't attack NPCs in starting
cities, and I don't want a city where they'll attack me unprovoked, and
I can't bind except at cities; that's making this experiment a bit tough.

Figuring I needed a city where I was friends but would be allowed to
attack, I headed to Skyshrine.  But I've never explored it much, and
I'm not sure how to get everywhere.  There seem to be some mobs above
level 57 (the level of my tracker) but I couldn't locate them.  The
highest mobs I did find were still under level 50.

I'm considering Shadow Haven, where the guards are 55, plus it's handy
to the Bazaar.  But I haven't checked whether those guards have also
been made unattackable.  The other choice I've thought of is Katta
Castellum, but I don't know if there's a place high enough to jump
from to get 20K damage.

Anyway, since as I said the best time for this would have been the wee
hours of the morning (to have the most people AFK in the Bazaar), it
was close to 6am by the time I got tired of exploring Skyshrine, so I
went to bed and am now posting this query in the hopes of having more
suggestions to try on some later night.  (And if anyone wants to send
me /con data, that'd be nice, too!)
