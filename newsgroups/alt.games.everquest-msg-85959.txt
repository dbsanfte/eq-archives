 After thinking about this I have one word: Undead. Find zones with
undead of the appropriate level. Most undead mobs (Skelly type anyway)
will not flee on low health so you don't have to worry about runners.
There are a variety of places to duo that I can think of off hand:

Level 30+  - Kaesora. The library is fairly good but odd aggro if the
monk feigns off a wanderer. There's also the church area but there are
ghosts there that run. Considering that it's just the two of you, the
best spot is probably the tunnel between the spiders up top and the
Library.

 Level 40+ - City of Mist. This will only really be half and half since
there's a lot of goos, golems and ghosts there. I don't recall many
being overly MR so root should work fine on those. At this level there's
also the skellys in Dreadlands north of the FV zone.

 Level 45+ - Karnors. Basement area. A bit tough at that level maybe,
but it's not like you're doing Verix or anything. There are places you
can camp and get pulls of 1-2. Also I don't think the little dogs run.
There are roamer ghost mobs (Curates being the most annoying since they
CH) but not many. If you find these a bit hard you can stay in CoM
longer since I think the XP is fairly good until 50 if you move a little
further in.


 Mainly the Shaman will be around to buff the monk and slow the mobs.
You don't have to worry about doing damage with DoTs or nukes. Your mana
will be better served for defensive tasks. Shaman buffs monk, monk pulls
mob, shaman slows mob, monk kills mob. Repeat. The Shaman/Monk duo is
one of the most powerful ones around and once you get into a groove you
should encounter very little downtime even with constant pulls if you
are just buffing, slowing and healing.
