No, of course not, but you're missing how this usually develops.  It goes 
more or less like this:

(1) Person A top posts
(2) Person B politely asks them to bottom-post, with a variable level of 
    'reason why' supplied.
(3) Person A flames person B for telling them what to do, usually citing
    from among: (i) that they've always done it that way, (ii) that they 
    see other people topposting in other groups (iii) that their newsreader
    is set up to toppost and god forbid they should figure out how to 
    change it.
(4) Persons C,D, and E post their support for Person A's god-given right 
    to toppost if they want to, generally flaming person B for being a 
    'self-appointed net nazi'.
(5) Persons F,G, and H (generally including at least one of bizbee and DT) 
    flame everyone of a lower letter for bringing this damn issue up 
    again.
(6) Persons I through M wander in, randomly topposting because they 
    haven't read the thread, and get the bejesus flamed out of themselves.
(7) Persons J and M have a thin skin, decide that biz and DT are @ssholes, 
    and devote the remainder of their newsgroup career to posting one-line 
    topposts following up each of their chosen stalking victim's posts.
(8) Person N decides there hasn't been a good flamewar for a couple days, 
    so he randomly topposts, usually including at least one taunt directed 
    toward biz, DT, or Ben.
(9) Go back to about step 4, and the cycle starts again!

The net result is, any random new topposter can expect minimum 5 flames, 
and if they're lucky, one of the quiet polite types may ask them nicely 
not to toppost, but don't count on it.  Those quiet, polite types 
generally figure they'd rather post something about EQ, since the flamers 
have already brought the subject to their attention anyway..

Just as an interesting sidenote, though, in the oldest 16 threads in which 
I could find Aruvqan as a poster, he was not flamed once for topposting.  
Nor was his topposting style called into question in any way, despite 
consistently doing so.  The nearest thing is a polite (by my standards, at 
least) followup from Graeme about a missed attribution.  He was even 
followed up to by DT without being flamed!  So I'm not sure how much of 
the preceding theory needs to be junked. :)

We generally bottom post here.  It leads to fewer pointless flamewars and 
makes threads easier to read.  Feel free to join the fun!

}> I dont know, if I were asked nicely at this time, I might change and

Please do!
