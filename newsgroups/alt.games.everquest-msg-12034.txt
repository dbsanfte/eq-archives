I logged in and played my cleric there last nite for a while and yes, I
noticed a huge difference.  Even with a 19 Ench, a 17 and 22 cleric, a
couple of 20 warriors and a 20 druid, we got our asses handed to us a few
times and this was doing what used to be yard trash on the ledge across the
moat (There seemed to be a crazed that spawned on the ledge that we would
wait for along with what were now red ghouls to me.  Yikes!)

Despite dieing 4 times on the nite, I did manage to get through all of 17
last nite and made 18 before going to Gfay to unload some bronze ... not a
bad nites work for a humble cleric :=)

Regards,

Wylbur

a.k.a Wylic, 18 Cleric on Tallon
