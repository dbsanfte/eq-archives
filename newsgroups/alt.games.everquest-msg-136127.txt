I took a 6 month break from EQ to play Camelot, but am now back
to EQ, having canceled my Camelot account.  Camelot has a lot
of features I think are improvements over EQ, and some of these
have already been described.  Many of these were what got me
to play Camelot for 6 months.

The problem for me with Camelot however is the smaller size of the
world, and less unique zones. I eventually got bored with the few
places I could hunt at a given level, even worse when you want to stick
with one realm.  At a given level, there is often only one dungeon
appropriate for you, and maybe a handful of outdoor zones.  EQ has so
many places to go, way more dungeons, and many more one of kind
zones.

I agree with someone that said Camelot is a "quick snack", you'll
like it for awhile, but if you want something you can stick with
a long time, EQ is better.
