    Exactly. When people say something like "enchanters slow, mez, haste,
clarity, tash, um, charm" they're talking about the majority of what they've
ever seen an enchanter do. Until you've been an enchanter, and seen the
massive array of tools they have, you have no idea what they can do. When my
ENC dinged 39 she had something like 17 spells to scribe, and there's a ton
of spells or spell lines that didn't get upgraded (nuke, DoT, stuns, fear,
Benevolence, enchant metals, Feedback, etc.) How would you know, unless
you'd been one? The same goes for the other classes with utility.

    What's the difference between you saying this, and one of those narrow
pidgeonholing types saying this?

    That same group leader might tell you that frittering away resources on
functions which that particular class is weak at, or which are less
effective than playing to a class strength, is a waste of time. And in a
game where time is the real limit on what you can see and accomplish,
wasting time is almost criminal. Your worldview is the better one
because...?

    It has more to do with my point than you know. So I better tell you. ;-)

    Answer: none of them did individually. I was the first one to see the
possible solution, but to reach the conclusion that the solution was sound I
needed to get information from our guild mages, enchanters, warriors, and
the guild strategist (a retired monk) in addition to what I bring to the
table as a senior cleric. With 105 levels across two priest classes, 141
levels across three melee characters, and 113 levels across three pure
casters I still needed to consult with specialists in various areas to
confirm my ideas or just to find out how things work. What hope does the
"average player", who may not read class forums or have more experienced
friends or a network of friends in different classes, have of knowing how
the classes interact with game mechanics?
