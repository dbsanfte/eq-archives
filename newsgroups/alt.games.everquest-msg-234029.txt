It's pretty common for the casters to stay unshrunk or lev'd and the melees
shrunk, makes targetting mobs easier.  On many raids, I'll insist on the
tanks being shrunk except the MT, MA, and puller if I'm being asked to
mezz/CC.  In LDON, unless you're doing one of the ones where there's little
elbow room (DGuk comes to mind) I find little value in shrink.

If you don't like being shrunk, just fire your Mask of the Deciever and go
DE, then click off the illusion.  You'll be full size again.
