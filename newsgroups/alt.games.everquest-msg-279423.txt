At lower levels monks can tank just fine. Hell I've been in groups lvl 
50+ where the enchanter tanks. (gets big aggro fast, and holds onto it;  
healers prop him up while nukers and lousy taunt- high dps classes (e.g. 
rogues/monks/etc) tear the mob to shreds. It doesn't work everywhere of 
course... but if you happen to have a group with strong healing, high 
dps, and no tanks... enchanters can stand up pretty well to slowed mobs 
that only get to swing a few times before they are dead... (stuns help 
mitigate damage even further)

It works well into the upper midgame at least. A modestly equipped 3-4k 
buffed robewearer can live plenty long enough against 50-60th level mobs 
that hit for under 500 a round (and that's LOTS of mobs)....especially 
if they can be reliably slowed, (and ideally snared)

(Seen it done in places like Veksar, Fungus Grove, Natimbi etc...)

No. You you monks are the best puller in *many* situations. Lief said 
monks are the best puller in a *small number* of situations.

No. I think he's saying that that your assertion that monks have the 
best FD should be tempered with the fact that FD (even lesser FD) is 
often better when coupled with snare.

That doesn't make monks worthless. It just further underscores that 
monks often aren't the best puller, even when FD pulling is required.

Even if the monks weren't 'best' at something so what? Most classes 
aren't the best at something outside limited special cases. Mages, 
Necros, Knights, Druids, Bezerkers, Beastlords etc all have to come to 
grips that they aren't the best dps, healers, pullers, cc, or tanks. 
That hardly makes them worthless.

Monks aren't the best pullers but they pull well. Monks aren't the best 
DPS class but they are still very good dps. Most groups in need of dps 
or a puller will gladly take a monk.
