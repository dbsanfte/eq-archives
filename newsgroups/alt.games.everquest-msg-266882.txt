Is UO growing, or is it just holding on to the same, slowly dwindling,
customer base? It's still a cash cow for Origin, but it's not going
anywhere. Anyone have reliable subscriber numbers?

UO is a slightly different beast, in that it faces less competition
than EQ...there are very few "sandbox" games. SWG is the only other
major one I can think of. (And the player base didn't want a sandbox,
they wanted EQ in space, so the game has been spinning for a year
trying to redefine itself) There's that Egypt game (I don't mean to
diss it, my brain is still waking up and I can't remember the name)
but that's not mass-market, to my knowledge.
