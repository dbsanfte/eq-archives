I'm going solely on my experience of HP/AC at level 59, and that was
that I have more than monks I know.

Also, and this is not insignificant when talking about the ability
to provide "tank" services, I can taunt.

Dont forget Monks may have higher caps but they have piss poor AC
generally, even with their inherent bonuses.
