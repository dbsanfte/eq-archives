I had the surname removed from my 53 necro recently.

1. /petition Please remove my surname

2. Got a tell from a guide asking if I wanted my surname removed.  I
answered "yes please, if it isn't too much trouble".

3. GM contacts me later and asked if I wanted my surname removed.  I
answered "yes, please"

4. GM says "I have removed your surname"

5. I answered "Thank you very much"

It doesn't appear to me that you even need a reason to get your surname
removed.  They don't ask why, and I didn't bother to explain it.
