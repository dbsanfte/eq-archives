I thought WoW was fun for the little time I got to play.

As far as choosing a game goes, graphics are nice but game play is what
makes me keep paying.  I played EQ for nearly 5 years before it got to
be more like work than fun.

I plan on giving WoW and EQ2 each a 4 month stretch to get me "hooked".
I did the  same for CoH, it was fun for almost 3 of the 4 =(.    I see
another mmorpg called "Vanguard" on the horizon, they will get the same
4 month shot.

At this point I can't wait for some other game to be the final nail in
the coffin for EQ as far as I am concerned.  I mostly play now just for
something to do after work since I don't get home until 1am or 3 am
depending on if I have to work overtime or not.
