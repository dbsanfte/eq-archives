Yeah, that ticks me off too.  That, and lower level players who have no
friggin clue about how to play their characters.  I was camping an IG one
time, and a 30th level Shaman bugs me to group with her.  I tell her there
is no way a 30th level Shaman is going to do well against an IG, no way in
hell grouping with me, a level 51 Druid at the time, would she get XP.
Surviving against an IG would be pretty low, even in a group, and if in a
group, she might not get anything except change.

Later on, when I was kiting a mob, she decides to start throwing spells on
it, not that she could KS it from me, but it ticked me off that she has to
mess with my kite.  I had to root it a bunch of times while the stupid
shaman tried to melee it.  And I wasn't going to take the time explaining
it to her that she shouldn't mess with it.  After it was done, I politely
tell her it isn't nice to mess with someone else's kite without their
permission and she tells me to fuck off.

On the flip side...  There was one guy who has a high level druid, who paid
me while I was camping IGs  with his lower character to buff him and regen
his lower level character when I had the time.  That is more of an ideal
person.  Too bad not many of them are around.
