The slow leveling aspect of EQ2 is what will make the game last.  I 
played EQ for 2 years, and got 1 char passed 60.  I'm not a power-gamer 
in that I want to level as fast as possible or be the best at just one 
thing.  I took the time to enjoy all of the aspects of EQ and it's what 
I will be doing in EQ2.  She's right about one thing, both games are 
catering to different audiences and therefore offer different game 
experience.

The paradox in WoW is that it's an MMORPG that will allow you to play 
solo for the entire game.  Isn't that what a single player game is for?
