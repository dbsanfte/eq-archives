Your friend is too low level to complete the quest (by virtue of not being
planar, which all epics require), and he's complaining about not being able
to? Break out the violins.

If you don't have the friends to kill reavers, I would say you do not
deserve your epic. It isn't meant to be soloed. Bank account should have
nothing to do with it.

Well, far as I know, the water scale is nodrop, and no druid can solo
faydedar, so the friend's requirement is still there. Most druids
interested in the epic would just quad kite raptors for the xp, and keep an
eye on tracking for fayd. Kill 2 birds with 1 stone and all that.

Because of course, the sheer volumne of people "standing around" in hate
and Air is mind numbing.

>Does your guild hand out surplus reavers

If they help on the raid, they get a shot at the drops.

Compensation, fine. 20k however is a little crazy. Besides, anyone who
tried to extort a rare nodrop component for an epic from me would rapidly
find no help from any of my friends and guildmates.

For the record, I've killed quillmane twice, and he had the legs both
times. This was months before the epics were put in place. What is your
point?

Err...then get them? You are not forced to spend the cash.

I'm hardly lording it over anyone, as this is the first time I've ever
mentioned in the newsgroup that I have it. Yes, I'm quite glad that the
designer did not have his head (entirely) up his ass when the quest was
made.
