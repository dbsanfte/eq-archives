New mob is "a nightfire drake". Its blueish, levl 52 or so and doesnt seem
to summon or have a breath weapon. It was totally snare/root/fear immune
when we took it down, but seemed to be affected normally by necro dots and
breath of karana. It dropped a scroll of nightfall (nodrop) We were able to
track it near the bw zone.
Im not sure if its faster than normal mobs, but its easily outrun with form
of the howler.
pretty easy kill for a 52 necrro/56 druid. I just let it chase me around
(druid) keeping agro while the necro dots/pets went to work.
