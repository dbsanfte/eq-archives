King Tranix is hard, that's a slightly stupid druid, since he summons, HTs
for around 750, and like all FGs, spells will only land on him from in melee
range.

Still, he's no match for a 60 druid + 55 warrior.

Lovely.

Stone Spider is nasty, he's got insane resists, I was only able to ever land
Winged Death and Drones of Doom off my bracer (they're both low resist
spells,and I got resists on them about half the time)

Well, actually you have to kill Tranix and the Magus in order to GET to
Nagafen's room, the optional FG named is Warlord Skarlon (grats bazaarmule
on Mithril arms).

Not to piss on your accomplishment though, killing Nagafen is a nice
milestone, too bad I'll never do it (did do Vox though), actually most of my
server doesn't get to see Nagafen or Vox much anymore since there's a gimp
guild that keeps most of it's members 52 so they can farm the dragons.
