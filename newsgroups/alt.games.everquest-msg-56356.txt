    I think that may have been his point, though. You hear "warriors have
more HPs than knights" all the time. But has anyone looked at a comparison
between a fatty SK, say, and an "insta-twink" halfling warrior? I know I've
heard groups say "get the warrior - he's a better tank", but I have yet to
hear a group say "oh, he's a halfling warrior - he'll have crap HPs". And
maybe they should. I doubt it, but it would be neat to see the numbers.
