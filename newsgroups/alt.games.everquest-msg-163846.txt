What I can tell you for certain is that at 51, some of the interior guards
were light blue to me, and I think a few were green, most were dark blue.
By 53 I believe most had gone light blue or green.  Looking on allakhazam,
the guards range from level 27 to level 50.  As I recall, most of the
interior guards were probably in the 30 to 40 range.  If you camp in the
gallows area, you can grab the guard by the NFP zone, then grab the one or
two that wander past the gallows area, then, start pulling from a bit
farther out.  Just con them first, to get an idea as to how feasible it is.
The loot was not bad, they dropped some plat and weapons and shields that
sold for a plat or more.  They also dropped helms that could be turned in in
NFP for pally/cleric faction.  Killing the militia also raises your NFP
factions.  I went from indifferent to ally doing this.  I was already KOS to
the militia due to some misunderstanding with Lucan.  At that point I
figured, they already hate me, may as well take advantage of it.  :)
