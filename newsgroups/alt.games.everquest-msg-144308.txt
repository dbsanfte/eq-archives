I started playing after Luclin came out.  I did not get to see what
the world looked like prior to each expansion.  How did things change
with each expansion?  I'm referring to the physical world, not the
game mechanics itself.  For example:

(1) Nexus Spires
The 5 norrath-based nexus spires are distinctly different in shape
than the other wizard portals.  Were they all like this prior to the
arrival of the nexus scions?

(2) Boat docks
Were the docks in Northern Ro and Oasis there prior to Kunark?  Did
they serve a purpose?  How about those shuttle docks to FV?

(3) Optional zones
How were the optional zones introduced?  Taked Jagged Pine, for
example.  Now there is a wall you can walk "through" to lead up to the
orb.  Was this walk through wall there prior to introduction of the
zone?  How about the warrens?  Was that introduced after the game's
release?  What happened when a person walked into the area in Paineel
where you would normally zone into the Warrens?

(4) Beastmaster Guilds
Introduction of a new class has to mean new guilds, right?  I don't
play a beastlord, but I would assume there had to be a suspiciously
empty building in the zone prior to Luclin.

(5) Planar entry
Here's an area I *really* don't know that much about.  But I believe
reading somewhere that planes were introduced with the introduction of
a particular expansion.  Were things altered in order to accomplish
planar entry?  For example, the plane of fear from Feerrott.  Was the
entire Feerrott zone altered and pushed down to everyone's machine
when that was introduced?  (perhaps it was there all along?  I can't
see a group of pre-kunark 50's taking on CT)

(6) The Hole
Was the hole added after the initial release of the game?  How did
things change, if that is the case?

(7) Quests
If a quest spanned more than one expansion, were things noticeably
altered?  This one is a bit of a stretch, as the only real thing that
would change is NPC text.  But an example would be the Wurmslayer
quest, which in part can require action in the temple of solusek ro. 
Yet the quest takes place in Kunark.  It would seem the solusek ro
portion was no programmed until release of Kunark.


Just curious.
