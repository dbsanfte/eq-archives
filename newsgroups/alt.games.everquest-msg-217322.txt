True.

"Great" is a bit of an overstatement -- I make more plat soloing in Dulak or
Rathe -- but still this is basically a true statement.

A bit of an overstatement -- I've done 25 adventures so far and I'd only
rate the exp as "pretty good." I've gotten faster exp elsewhere, more than
once.

Absolutely. The jackasses are being weeded out, because LDON exposes them as
such more clearly than EQ has up to now.

Can't comment here since I've only reached the mid-50s. But I do see plenty
of 60s players LFA so that suggests that LDON is fun for them too.

True, true.

Perhaps. Similarly, you would get your ass kicked in real life, literally or
in terms of personal relationships, if you presented your point of view the
same way there as you do in this newsgroup.

> Some of you are spoiled, ill-mannered, immature

Well put, I was about to make the same point about you. And just to be
clear: when someone who largely _agrees_ with your argument still thinks you
are an asshole....that's _not_ a good thing.
