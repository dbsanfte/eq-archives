    And here I thought it was because they buffed HPs worse than a cleric,
mitigated damage taken (the entire job of a healer) less efficiently than a
cleric, and didn't have the ability to regain XP lost after death like a
cleric. One of the best geared casters in my guild is a druid. He's very
good at his job, and is a great lateral thinker. If I was looking for a
healer for a group, I'd pick any of our clerics before him just because of
the reasons mentioned above.

    60+ necromancers struggle even more, because much of their DPS requires
the target to survive for longer than the average XP mob survives. They also
lose their primary means of damage mitigation (fear immunity of high level
mobs), which was a strong part of their utility.
