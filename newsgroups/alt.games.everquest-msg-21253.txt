Um, excuse me, when did I say I actually did anything I wrote in my post?
Someone asked how to get a CD key, I told them.  My EverQuest CD key is
perfectly legitimate.  I am also not a bitch, I don't believe dogs can type
with those paws.  Who am I posing as or ripping off?  Congratulations, you
have managed to make a fool out of yourself, keep up the good work!
