> Basically, should I ever be trying to draw aggro?

In a group situation like LDoN, that is correct, you shouldn't be
TRYING to get agro. The reason for having a Main Tank with high
AC/HP is that the cleric can concentrate CH's on that one player,
which are very mana efficient. There is also the timing issue on
the part of the cleric. A CH Takes 10 seconds to cast, and that
spell cast time cant be effected by spell hastes; it is always 10
seconds. And during that 10 seconds, the cleric cant cast
anything else.

What I do is have two sets of weapons. Normally I use a light
velium brawl stick which produces a high damage each hit, but
hits at a medium speed; and also a spear/claw set which hit for
lower damage per hit but faster. Depending on the skill of the
tank, and the other DPS classes I will change weapon sets to keep
from getting agro while producing the highest possible DPS.

Yes and No.

At L65 I've noticed a lot of mobs tear me up even with my PSC.
Remember that a beastlord is a cross between a monk and a shaman.
That is both a disadvantage in straight tanking, but can be used
as an advantage in that with careful tactical planning, you can
still solo many mobs by using your warder to hold the mob long
enough to cast some well thought out spells.

Remembering that not only half of your damage, but half of your
HP is in your warder can go a long way tactically. You have to
use him effectively though.
