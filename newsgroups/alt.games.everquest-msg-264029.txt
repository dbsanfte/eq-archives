*You're* accusing someone else of playing semantic games? That's rich.

Yes, the moment you resorted to an unsubstantiated and irrelevant jab, it 
quit being criticism and became insult. I've not insulted you yet. 
Perhaps if any criticism is an insult in your eyes, you should grow a 
thicker skin.

Your point being...? That's strong indication of nothing. You're gonna 
have to do much better than that to back up those claims.

Of course you can. I didn't make the distinction of any sort of subject 
matter in the example. Now your just twisting it.

Not yet, but I'm getting there.

That's right, because if you don't deem their choice for an alias to be 
appropriate, they must be lacking in credibility. /boggle
