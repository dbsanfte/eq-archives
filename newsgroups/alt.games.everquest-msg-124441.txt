Both my girlfriend and I are major EQ addicts. My sister recently gave birth
to a beautiful baby girl. I am not big on babies but I could see having fun
taking a 4 year old to the zoo, the park etc. So I said to my girlfriend "We
should just power level the baby to age 4." =)

Of course there is also our joke of people ninja looting parking spots at
the mall.
