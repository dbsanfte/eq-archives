With the type of gear, AAs and levels I would expect you to have, AoW is 
not going to happen, Vindi is not very likely, but perhaps.  A lot would 
depend on the specific classes, their levels, equipment, and AAs.  I can 
tell you that back when I was in a family and friends guild, where levels 
were 50s to 65, we had a rough time with ToV, but did manage (with a raid 
of 30 to 40 people), we did kill Trakanon a few times, and did hit 
targets in DN at times.  We also did Vindi, and AoW.  We did not do any 
of those with anwhere near as few people as you are talking about 
however.
