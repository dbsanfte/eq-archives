It would be nice if a couple other keys that aren't /keyring-able
could become so.  I'm thinking of Befallen specifically.  Maybe an NPC
where you turn in the original and he gives you one that can be placed
on the keyring.  I think it might increase traffic in this zone, and
possible some of the others.

Are there any others that *aren't* on the list that could be converted
(ie No-Rent, or little used keys).
