Damn straight. Respect is earned in this world. No one gets a free
ride.

I have NO empathy for people who waste thier lives, or blame the
problems they create on others. That's it, end of story. I am no more
selective than that.

Guess you can't spare any empathy for me or the other 400K+ players
who are not total screw-ups. And you claim to be a professional who
deals with people and their problems? If you cannot see that EQ is
bigger than "just a game" I feel sorry for the people you "help".
