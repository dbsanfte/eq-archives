I am not aware of an actual problem with it, but it might clear up some
inconsistencies with some tests.

Good, now just hope the 10 casttime restriction is also removed for
everything except CH so I can get some seconds off that robe and pants
click.

Great boon for mages, considering we have no other defenses after LD except
gate.

> - Removed all "Begins to cast X spell" text from procs

Humm, don't know if I'm too happy about that one. I have all my item effects
close to eachother and in the heat of a battle I have been known to try to
cast Burnout3 on the MT or Reclaim Energy when I tried to DS my pet. Getting
the message in the box helped me to react quick before I even looked at my
spellcast bar.

Wow, this is a good improvement. Although it might result in some extra spam
it's useful for most classes to know what spells are being cast around
him/her. Mostly a boon for healer classes to know when a cure spell is
needed (especially blindness in CoM 8D ), but also useful for buffers for
instance.

Too bad of the DS stack, but we already knew it was very close to an
exploit.
The stacking of levitate was a mjor issue for me as a mage. I normally have
levitate on almost always. A DMF or SoE drive-by buff would drop me directly
to the ground until I zoned. I myself have encountered moments that a SoE
buff literally killed me because I was too far off the ground (and just a
wee bit encumbered :)

Great. Good bugfix for the quick summoning, don't know if anybody actually
trained Turn Summoned for the all of 1 or 2 50+ zones that have summoned
creatures in the first place.
Still no bugfix for Frenzied Burnout or some improvements on the elemental
forms though.


> ** Zones **
>
> - The Hole now uses Kunark-level Mez/Charm/Taunt rules

Is this a good thing? Our guild has been hunting there a lot lately and we
didn't encounter much problems. Not really tried charming anything there,
but mez and taunt worked fine enough for us.

> - High level NPCs can now be taunted in Cazic Thule

Tanks keeping the mobs away from the casters. Good.
Hmm, possible mage-solo spot at entrance now? The mobs not sticking to the
pets was a major problem.

I know of the TM problem (pet couldn't get into the cave) and the Chardok
exploit(s).
The rest probably were bugged, but the most known zone isn't there, Hate
(2nd floor).

Anyway, a good start at least.

Hmm, let's check what exactly they did before judging this one...

8th! Woot !

1000? Damn, that's a lot. Off to eqtrader and re-print every trivial list I
guess..

Good.

Damn, now I need to swim down to Phinny and Undertow to check if they're up
again. Too bad, it really helped to check on named spawns in a zone.

> - Pets will once again tell you who they are attacking by sending its

Good !

> - Pet attack animations should now be working for all pets

Too bad there aren't any more animations then the standard ones, but seeing
them do anything is a nice bugfix.

Great. Setting a default chat channel for raids means I don't need to rework
every announcement button every single raid.

"spread the arrivals" ?  Seems like an improvement, but I think I'll see
people being put under the earth the coming next weeks :-/

> - /cry is now working

It wasn't?

> - Target Nearest NPC (F8 by default) has been fixed.

Finally.. now to improve /assist to react somewhat faster and targetting is
about as good as it can get.


Well, all in all a very interesting patch. I myself am gone for 5 to 6 days
so I won't be around to see the mess and hopefully return to an enriched
environment :)
