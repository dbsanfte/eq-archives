I think it's only fair to also mention the incredibly inconvenient 
inertia. It takes forever for a horse to get up to speed, or to fully 
stop... this means lots of unintentionally interrupted spells. Of course, 
intentionally interrupting a spell is also a lot harder, since you can't 
duck while on a horse.

All in all, since they fixed the old graphics exploit, horses are hardly 
worth the bother, at least for me. Perhaps clerics still consider them 
useful. Personally, I sold mine.
