That's why our guild leader's wife is a 52 druid who's been hanging at that
level just for Vox and Naggy raids?  Actually, three of our highest
characters are druids.  One of them just hit fifty with only occasional
playing for almost a year.  I've seen Anwyn play.  It's not quite as unholy
as an AE group, but it's pretty nasty.  My poor paladin only wishes she
could do stuff like that.  Hmm, maybe a paladin should get Complete heal as
well, to make up for the fact that we can't dual wield.
