Which is part of what I like so much about pure random.  Everyone but
everyone understands the system, since its what they've used since their
early 20s in most pickup groups.  Does it answer all complaints?  No, but
then neither does a points system.

The system I proposed here is similar to your tier system, basically the
high attendance guys (or the ones that have attended sporadically for
a long time and never gotten any loot) have a much better chance at
items, and yet there is never anyone who cannot possibly win the item.
Have I mentioned how much I hate knowing for certain that I can't win?

Yep, fairness and the perception of fairness outweigh most any other
feature of a loot system.

I think thats whats driving me here, honestly, -to me- it seems unfair
that Joe Guest, the (insert class we needed so bad we invited one from
outside the guild) cannot possibly win an item if there is any competition
for it at all, or that the rank and file members who turned the 10 "every raid"
guys into a 30 man raid capable of actually -killing- Ubermob X can't
win any drops unless the Ten Guys don't want it, just because they only
show up on half the raids (and other groups of 20 out of the hundred in
the guild show up for the other 30 man raids, doing the same job and getting
the same thanks)

I understand the need to reward attendance, so I came up with this
hybrid system, hopefully capturing the good things about both points
and random, and still leaving out the possibility of bias.  Of course a
little simplicity is sacrificed, but I hope not too much.
