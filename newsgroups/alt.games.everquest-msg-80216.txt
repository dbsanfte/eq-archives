> TRAIN THAT YOU PERSONALLY WITNESSED IN GAME:

There's only one that really sticks out in my mind: Mistmoore.  Some
guildies and I were fighting in the graveyard, when things get a bit sticky
and we have to run to zone.  No big deal, no one gets hurt.

So after we finish medding and healing in Lesser Faydark, we head back in.
I take about three steps in, to the point where I can see down the ramp, and
I see the scariest looking sea of mobs (led by one or two players) rushing
towards me.

I didn't even make it to the zone (yes, I was still only three steps from
it).  The *entire* castle was emptied, and I swear they all targeted me
first.  Such a burst of damage and spell messages (landing on ME) I have
never seen before or since.

I don't remember exactly what level I was... maybe 18-20?  (That sound right
for doing the graveyard?)

-John
