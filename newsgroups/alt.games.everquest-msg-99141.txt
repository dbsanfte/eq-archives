Yeah, and only 20ish in #horseporn.  We have some odd folks on inny.  

I will say that it made it soooo much nicer for the raid to have a channel in 
which to goof off.  For some reason my guild *needs* to be silly during raids, 
but playing pun games and stuff really clutters up the /guildsay, now we just 
created a channel, all get to play around in there a bit, and can still see the 
important raid orders.  Now if I could just send the output to another window...
