  So you're saying my grammar and spelling required tidying up?  Okay boys,
GET OUT THE CROSS!

  Kidding, of course.  I usually manage to mangle at least one sentence per
post.  I learned a couple months ago how to supersede newsgroup messages to
fix those mistakes, but now for some reason the newsgroup reader I was using
to do it, won't do it anymore so I still have to live with botched posts
half the time.  Ah well.  Maybe someday I'll learn to get it right the first
time around.
