Boats have been down for a very long while.

Here is the deal on Translocators; they are not a timed spawn NPC.
When servers go down, these NPC stay down. You need to petition a GM
(unless they have changed this GMs only, not guides) which may take
some time as they seldom seem on any longer and ask them to respawn
these NPCs. Odds are since PoP, nobody has really had a need to ask
for them to be respawned, I know I no longer ask....
