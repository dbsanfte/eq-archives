While Sony and Intell are doing us all favors it would be nice if the fixed
the problems with the i810 motherboard with the built in sound and video
cards.  Sony told us it would work fine with 512 meg of Ram and a PIII chip,
but they were wrong on all counts and the stinking board is almost
impossible to upgrade.  That said I think I would trust this combos promises
about as much as I would the word of a greasy used car salesman in a flood
zone.
