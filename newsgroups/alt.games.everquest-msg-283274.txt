Looking again at the FAQ:

Temporary
	an item that will go away 30 minutes after the bearer logs out (if it's 
a container, it used to be that everything inside also went away, but 
early in 2005 this was changed so the container instead becomes a very 
heavy non-magical bag, so you don't lose the contents)

OK, I know I played EQ for several months in mid 2005, and I don't 
remember this change at all!  Of course, I was always very careful not 
to leave anything valuable in a summoned bag... because I remember 
losing some things I really didn't want to lose by just that sort of 
mistake!

FUnny how many things you learn, only to find later you could have 
unlearned them, only you didn't learn that!
