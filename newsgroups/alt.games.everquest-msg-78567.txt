I won't "talk your ears off" as Orlun suggested, but it's the Kunzar
Ku'jach (sp?). Looks like a giant elk antler. It's 8/22 which isn't all
that impressive, but it procs engulfing darkness. That's a very nice
snare, particularly for a small group wihtout a snarer, and has a low
level DOT component. EXCELLENT for increasing hate and controlling aggro
for a tank. Served me well. Green Jade Broadsword drops there also, but
I never saw one.

Orlun already covered that and didn't miss anything that I recall.
