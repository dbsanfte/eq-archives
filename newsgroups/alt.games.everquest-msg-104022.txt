Greed, or misinformation.

About 2k pp before the myth.  Pitty it's not true, the rumored price for a
lore one was about 800pp.  Since a Paladin can't Dual Wield, I'd have

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
