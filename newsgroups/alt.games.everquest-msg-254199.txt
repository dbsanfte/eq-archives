I have no doubt that, say, at level 30 with offense 150-ish, you
could take a 0 skill in 2HS or whatever and skill up fairly fast
by using a 2HS against blue mobs.  But since the mobs are "tuned"
for fighting players with 2HS skill close to 150, it means you're
not going to be hitting them very well until your skill gets up
quite a ways.  So to train up a weapon skill from zero to 150 at
that point means doing a lot of fighting where you can't hit the
mob.  Sounds like a bad plan to me.

You might find some friends who'll kill the mobs for you while
you flail wildly with your unskilled weapon.  But I'd be mildly
embarrassed having to resort to that.  I sometimes ask my group
if it's okay before I switch from my HTH/1HB (skill 180+ in each)
to my 2HB (skill currently 156) to get some training in, but I do
most of my training solo so I can use my more effective weapons
when grouped.

That said, I will admit that the flip side also holds: since a
weapon skill of 0 is so bad, it can be useful to dump a few points
in to get the skill up to where you can use the weapon and not have
the mobs roll on the floor laughing as they kill you.
