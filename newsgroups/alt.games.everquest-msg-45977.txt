LOL!
Oh yeah. They're almost as nerfed as the Druids.
he he he
Necros. Oh man. That's priceless.
Seriously, they may have had some of their previous toys taken away, but
at least where I hang out, they are likely the second most soloable
class, possibly the most versatile if well played for grouping, and have
particular skills that nobody else does that will always assure
"business" for them. I can certainly see the wizards, rangers, and a
couple other classes complaining, but I think Necro's, Druids, Warriors,
Clerics, and Enchanters are the ones who should count their blessings.
