Highpass always has people but can get overcrowded.
East Karana doesn't always have people but always has things to kill.
Ill Omen you're just a touch low for and it's on the idiot cycle
(LoIO, FM, OT, DL) but you could survive there.
Unrest always has people but its not terribly good experience.
Paludal always has people but goes extremely overcrowded at primetime.
Netherbian might be slightly too high for you.

Most other zones at that level (besides Oasis) will be near deserted.
