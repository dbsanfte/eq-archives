I used to do that once too.
before I got to level 65 I had a shield of infused power, and the FT1 staff
from servitor in griegs end.
both are easily one group doable. Get a tank and you can probably "4-box"
them.

When you get ino the guild....
A good chanter primary drops in the "girl trial" in HOH. Lowers tash agro.
XTC in ssra drops a FT6 shield with decent resists. (shield of the creator)
