I just started a dark elf necromancer character (The Rathe) and had a few
questions about them in general.
I know they have a very bad reputation outside of neriak but i was wondering
exactly how bad is it going to be when my newbie feet leave the cosy streets of
Neriak? am i KOS everywhere?, and what can i do to raise a little faction,
particularly with those human scum....er....i mean the freeport folks. I heard
about a 'orc pick quest' and just planned to go hell for leather on those green
bastards till the guards come realise im not bad...just misunderstood :)
Also, whats a good weapon for a necromancer? i notice they only have 1 and 2
handed blunt proficency slots but am stuck with a piercing dagger at the
moment.
Im level 5 right now and am planning to blow the neriak popstand(for good,
place is so depressing and twisty)around level 7. Where will i find a new home?
cheers
any other thoughts on necro's or dark elfs in general appreciated.
