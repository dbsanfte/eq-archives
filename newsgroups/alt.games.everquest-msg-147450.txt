PINHEAD, Brother, PINHEAD.
I never forget the ones before 911, I still remember the names of my
squad mates that are gone.

OCT 12, 2000  USS COLE

OCT 23, 1983 US Marine base in Beirut

What about the Bombing of the US Barracks in Dhahran in 96' no one
even remembers that, 500 US and Saudi's Killed. That's why I walk in
the parades, for them , not me.
And some little puke is going to bad mouth my service record?!
