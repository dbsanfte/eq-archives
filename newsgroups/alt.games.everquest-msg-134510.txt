Ah, that's cool, Crash. Just checking. Paranoid after Valentines day. If
I can't log in tonight, I don't care. Just making sure it's not a
stealth change of something with my drivers again or whatever the fuck.
If it's busy tonight, I don't care.

I'll try again later. If others are getting the flashing dots when
"trying to connect to Everquest Server" or getting to the download/patch
screen and locking up and getting in later, I'll just assume it's busy.
