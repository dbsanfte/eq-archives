I'm quite certain the Hasbro sponsored monopoly tournament would forbid 
your little example.

Your characterization of Everquest is fundamentally wrong.

Everquest can be played in the manner you describe, but that is not how 
the majority play it, nor is it really the manner in which it was 
intended to be played. Everquest has challenges and rewards and players 
are expected on some level to meet those challenges and take those 
rewards. New expansions bring new challenges and rewards. It is not some 
game of 'playing house' where you just take on a role and have fun... 
pretending to be the mommy or the baby.

A huge segment, the great majority even I would say, have goals they 
would like to achieve, quests they would like to complete, levels or AAs 
they would like to attain, etc. There is, if not 'competition' a 
'struggle' within the game. Also because its an online community, the 
struggle is collective, and this inevitably leads to comparisons between 
characters.

At any rate, legitimizing purchasing your way through undermines the 
struggle, and invalidates the 'terms of engagement'. Give the player a 
legitimate option to struggle or coast to the same reward and you 
undermine the perceived value of the struggle, and this will suck the 
entertainment value out of the game.
