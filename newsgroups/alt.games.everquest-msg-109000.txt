Yah - I read up about them after they razzed me which is why I thought it
was so odd to see 2 of them but the thing was I didn't get to kill either
one of them. I just went back to parse my log files then but they stopped
after I had my characters moved to Stormhammer 5 days ago : (

I noticed I lost all my hot keying need redoing but forgot to check to see
whether the logging was still running so lost the chance to tweak some
serious Druid nose hairs....doh.

Gimp and I didn't manage to take either one down - and the summoning was
disorientating - (first time I have been summoned) but I was summoned a
moment after Gimp went down and literally within a few seconds was summoned
yet again - it was that quick.

How quick can mobs summon? That would answer the question right away. In the
ruckus I could easily make a mistake - but if they only summon every 15 or
30 seconds or whatever then it could only have been 2 of them...unless the
Tainted Cyclops summon as well of course....   : |
