 Only if the item in question dropped all twenty times would that be a
valid observation. The point is you shouldn't be relying on random luck
to gain items. You should be able to put in your time and be awarded
accordingly. If you only show up on raids where you have a chance at
getting loot, expect guild members (including officers) to start
noticing. The only time I support random rolling on drops is if it's a
mixed guild or pickup raid. Even then I prefer the Need Before Greed
motto but not everyone prescribes to that.
