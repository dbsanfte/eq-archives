They do but all the servers are based in the US.

Actually 3am EST would be 9am. It is 3am PST which is 11am GMT, you are
right there.
These patches used to start at 7am PST (3pm GMT) and be 8 - 10 hours which
basically wiped out the evenings play for most of Europe. Although no
statement was ever released as to why the times changed I can only assume it
was to cater for Europe. This would have cost them money as they'd have to
pay staff more to work those hours.

Make sense for us users in Europe but not financially, VI and Sony are in
business to make money, to do this they must keep the majority of their
customers happy, which they do. If they spent money on setting up servers in
Europe do you think they'd also bother to do the patches in the early hours?
No, they'd start them at 9am, back to square one.

Been going on since EQ began, will continue going on until EQ is on its
Death Bed. Doesn't seem to be detrimental to the success of the game.

I'm sure they can too, they just won't, they have no real need. Maybe, when
SWG is released, they may do something like this, setting up servers in
other continents like Europe (hope they don't choose UK, I shudder at the
thought of BT hosting servers Holland would be a good choice I think) but
that remains to be seen.

I am guessing you are relatively new to the game and have had your first
"Damn I had planned to play all day and it's being patched" It's happened to
all of us, both sides of the pond. You will learn to accept it as part of
the course, as you will learn not to trust the servers stability for the
next day or so after a patch :ï¿½)
