Uh-oh.

Ok, this is getting creepy. A friend of mine had that exact same
situation about a month ago. He ended up replacing the motherboard.

And about a week ago, it started happening to me, as well. I got the
error you noted above, and several others as well. Not just in EQ
(though that's where it first became evident). I couldn't even reboot
without getting the errors. And every time I tried, it was a different
error.

I did a lot of looking on the net (with my other computer, naturally),
and saw some indication that it might be linked to the SBLive, so I
pulled the card. It didn't really help much. I hunted down and removed
all the SBLive drivers (harder than you might think), and installed a
new card. I also reinstalled the Win2k O/S over the existing one.
After a sold two days of cussing, the problem *seems* to have cleared
up. Mostly. And I don't know what finally did the trick.

I say mostly because I'm still getting weird lockups (in and out of
game) from time to time, and if I play DAoC I *must* reboot before
playing EQ.

You have my sympathies. Sorry I don't have anything else to offer.
