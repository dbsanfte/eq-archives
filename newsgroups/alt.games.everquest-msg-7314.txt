Try http://vindicar.dopplegangers.com/ultimate.htm  (which is only one
of several places "the ultimate flame" makes an appearance)

This is irony, right? Please tell me it is irony. Did you read this
through before pasting it? Did you feel even the slightest twinge of
embarassment at such blatant uncredited plagiarism!?

> With all of AGE's love,

You don't speak for *all* of AGE. You speak for yourself. Like it or
not, Avenger is a partaker of A.G.E. That makes him a subset of the
whole, making your use of the word "all" useless. Also, I don't recall
you polling everyone asking permission to act as spokesperson for us
"all".

Well, in your favour, you didn't include "unoriginal" on your charge
sheet. That would have meant us adding "hypocritical" to *yours*.

Even though you didn't write it yourself, that so called "ultimate
flame" is no more than a piss poor list of insults. A true flame is
much more subtle and cutting.
