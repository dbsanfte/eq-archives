For the most part it's awesome.  Love casting the best pet possible :)
The new UI looks wild too but only problem I have was that when I click on
say for example "A Forest Giant Hillock" the target window only shows "A
Forest Giant" so I never see what kind it is.  Is there a way to make window
bigger to see the full name?  I've tried stretching but it doesn't work for
that windows.
