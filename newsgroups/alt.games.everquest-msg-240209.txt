Actually this never happened until I started tanking hard side of PON.  Then
grps seemed to want Knights to tank more than warriors.  I place a lot of
the blame to casters who were lazy but the fact remained that most grps
wanted Knights and rather than bitch about it I let the knights tank and I
used my windblade to do more DPS.  I could pull agro away from knight and
onto myself but then you hear the healers bitch about having to heal two
tanks instead of just the MT.  A Warrior at these levels really has two
choices.  One is complain until he is made MT and then hear the bitching
when a caster starts getting beat on a few times or just grp and do the best
DPS he can.

My thoughts on a good group would be to have a Warrior Main Tank and a
Paladin as assistant tank  If the warrior ever lost agro to a caster then
the paladin could quickly get the mob onto himself then allow the warrior to
pull mob back on himself, then paladin does a quick heal to himself.  With
this strategy the knight would always have enough mana in reserve for an
emergency while the warrior will always be doing his best to keep mob's
attention.

As far as your comment about Malo goes maybe the shamans got tired of
hearing the others bitch about then being too slow with their slows.  I
retired my warrior and have no inclination to ever return to the class.  I
am running a shaman now and casting a malo followed by a slow takes a damn
good amount of time.  Guess I need to invest in a spell haste item.  Malo
can be resisted, and if it is would you have the shaman cast it again in
hopes that it lands or try for a slow?  A better strategy is for ENCH and
Shamans to grp.  ENCH Tash's mob when it is incoming and Shaman slows.
Tashi always lands.
