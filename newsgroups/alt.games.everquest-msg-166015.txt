I saw something a couple of months ago that may or may not be the same
thing.  X says in guildchat they they are logging off.  Everyone says
goodbye, except me, since I'm in the middle of a fight.  Fight ends, and I
do "/who all X" to see if they have logged off yet.  A level 2 Iksar Monk in
Field of Bone shows up named X.  (The "real" X was a level 60 Dark Elf
Necromance who had been in the Bazaar).

I don't know if this was really a duplicate name.  It seems strange that the
new X showed up right as the old one logged off, so perhaps there is a
situation where the servers simply get confused about the name of a logged
in player.  There are at least three separate logical servers involved when
you play EQ: the world server, the character server, and the login server.
Furthermore, the world servers seem to be actually partitioned into groups
of zones--that is, they seem to be several clusters, each cluster running a
group of zones.  When someone zones, some of their information is passed
from the cluster running the zone they are leaving to the cluster running
the zone they are entering, and some of it comes from the character server,
which is queried by the zone servers.  (Hence, the old faction bug, where
you'd get into the zone and be able to play, before the character server
sent the faction information, so the zone server would use default
factions).  Anyway, from bugs like the faction bug, and things Verant has
said in various interviews, we know that the interaction between the various
servers involved is asynchronous.  It would not surprise me if if there was
a place in there where a mutex is missing on some table update somewhere,
and so someone zoning at just the right time can end up with the information
of a newly logged out player.
