Couldn't get mine to start last night while I was fitting HDD to second
PC...couldn't get it to work while installing Win2k on said PC and setting
it up.
Switched dial up to Second PC, now completed install, it looked like it
might start...when I got back in, it hadn't. Started last night before bed,
had finished this morning. Started main PC off before leaving for work...I
like patch days on Wednesdays as I'm generally out :�)

My friend has just returned to EQ (after Vowing he'd never touch another
product with Verant's name on it) after tiring of DAoC, he quit EQ a couple
of months before DAoC went live. Tuesday was his first day back, we chatted
on the phone while I reminded him what everything did and then on his second
day he gets largest patch we've had in months and congested patch servers to
boot, lol...welcome home :�)
