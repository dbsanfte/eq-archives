There have already been a few good posts, but since you asked, here's my
take on it.
Any trade skill, unless essential to your survival, should be seen as a
bene. There are a few like fletching that I would consider essential for
some classes. They are there for something to do other than fight and heal,
rinse, repeat. Sure you can make money at it, if done properly, make stuff
that is in need in the area you are in, if you are a jewler, make STR+ rings
over in Kaladim for all the Dwarf STR hungry pallys. It's like any biz in
real life, you gotta have money to make money and you gotta have a target
market. You're probably not going to make much fletching in Kelethin for
example since most people there are already doing fletching.

The other thing is to ask yourself what is your motivation? Is it plat?
There are better ways of getting plat than a trade. Is it the novelty of
being a Erudite Grandmaster Smithe? Is it the personal satisfaction of being
a master in many trades? Only you can answer these questions. But my take on
it is this. EQ has been around for a long time (in computer game years) and
will probably be around for a few more years. In that time, you should have
more than ample time to become master in a few trades. Take your time, enjoy
the view, its not a race against anyone besides yourself. I am only a L24
pally myself and KNOW I have MUCH to learn. Everyday I learn something new
and in turn try and help those younger than me learn as well. Somedays I
don't even have time to think about going to the ol' forge and sweat for 1
more point because I am engaged in a conversation about the latest quest
that may or may not be broken. Asking people what weapon they have and where
the hunted to get it. Asking people what faction hits come from killing XYZ
mob. You get my point.

Well I've talked long enuff, I'll get off my soapbox now <scrape scrape>.

Hope you enjoy the journey in Norrath.
