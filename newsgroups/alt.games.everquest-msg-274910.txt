So what? How does that have any bearing on this? Even if the Department 
of Health did send someone over you could still deny him entry, and be 
perfectly within your legal rights. If he barged in you could have the 
police escort him back out and charge him with tresspassing.

Of course, the DoH guy could and would get a warrant and/or order the 
business closed to the public, suspend the business license, etc.... but 
that's not the point. He doesn't, and nobody else either, has the right 
to just come in.

(Law enforcement, emergency response, and similiar other cases under 
exceptional circumstances naturally excepted from this... and they can 
come into your house too under those same exceptional circumstances... 
so the analogy is consistent even with respect to that.)

He's right with respect to the salient facts. It was a good analagy.
