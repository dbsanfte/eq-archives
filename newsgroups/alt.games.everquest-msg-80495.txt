Georg, this was a great post. I got several chuckles from it. It also made
me remember when my character (Darkling) married another (Amra) in Gemstone,
years and years ago. All text, of course, but the descriptions of my gown
were quite beautiful, and so was the ceremony. Of course, just as in RL, as
so often happens, it didn't last. But it was fun while it did :)

Darklet (sorry for the top posting, didn't want to snip any of your fine
words)
