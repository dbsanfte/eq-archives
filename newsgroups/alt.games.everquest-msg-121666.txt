I've had it working a 366MHz Celeron with 192MB of Ram. Wasn't pretty on 
Luclin but worked fairly well in the older zones. I'd suggest making sure 
all the new models and animations are turned off in the eqclient.ini file 
then give it another try. You might also try updating your video card's 
driver. (And perhaps disabling the sound in EQ.) If you can get it to work 
again, start turn features (like sound) back on one at a time until you 
find the one hanging the game.

Good luck,
