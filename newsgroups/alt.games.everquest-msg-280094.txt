High-end game, Shaman and SK combo is tough to beat, don't know that they'd
be the same at lower levels though.
Cleric and Ranger strikes me as a good duo, you have SoW, DS, Snare, Buffs,
Rezzs, Heals all before 30.
Cleric and Paladin you have the problem of lacking DPS, unless you stick
exclusivly to undead.
Shaman and Paladin might work alright, bit low on DPS unless the shammy is
dotting though.

Ultimatly, I'd pick the class that was the most fun to play, and have him do
the same, don't worry about a "good duo" too much, EQ is still a game, ment
to be fun :-)
