Another thing to keep in mind is that EQ is very boring to watch.
I've watched over the shoulder of a Legacy of Steel member as they
have done some pretty major fights...and it is just not that exciting
to watch.  It's much more fun playing my character in my non-uber
guild on, say, a Kedge raid or a Hole raid than watching someone else
play, even if they are uber and fighting uber mobs that my character
will never see.
