No it went like this.  The zone said each time I was tryin to get into it
was down.  The GM had me call customerservice cause he/she could not figure
out why I could not get into it. That is why I called since I was told to by
a GM and that why why the long forever wait for a rep then to find out I
needed Kunark to do it..  So this time will do what I have learned .  Pay
someone good in PP and get the new spells.  Dont want a horse.  Kitties to
me dont look like that much fun.  Now if they could be amonk that would be
wild.
