This link will help you with your newbie armor quests:

http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/freeport_warrior.htm

Also, as others have mentioned, /consider, or /con, is a HUGE help. While 
soloing, always target a mob and type /con before attacking (or getting 
too close). If the resulting text is blue, black or white, it might be 
worth a shot. Pay attention to what it says though. It is informative 
regarding the strength of the creature. Green text indicates a mob that 
will not give you any xp to kill. Beyond that it gets more difficult 
(therefore more xp-profitable) as follows: light blue, dark blue, 
black/white, yellow, red. This was certainly covered in the manual, btw. 
/Con is also available on a "socials" key in the socials window. If you 
left click and hold this button, you can drag it over and drop it onto 
your hotkeys button bank for easier access.

Beyond that, a little effort in learning the game can really pay off. 
Some useful web sites are:

http://eq.crgamer.com
http://www.allakhazam.com

The more you read and ask questions, the more sense it will all make.

Good luck.
