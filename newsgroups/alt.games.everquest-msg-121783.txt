I became a Defiler this morning.  I did all of level 54 at the gazebos in
City of Mist.  Thought it was a cool, out of the way zone and really enjoyed
it.  However, when I hit 55 I saw that the exp there was not going to do it
at 55.  On some advice, I traveled to Skyfire to do some fear kiting.  Seems
like a fun place to be and the exp seems ok.  I want to start seeing some
more of the world, after enjoying CoM so much.  Can anyone give me some
other ideas on where I can do well solo at 55, either fearkiting or
root/dotting, that I might find interesting.  I plan to go do the sun reaver
castle in SD at 56 then Othmir at 57, so I don't want to do either of those
yet.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
