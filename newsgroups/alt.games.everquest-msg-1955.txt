This

> instructions. You will now become part of the Mail Order business. In this

in the

pay

lists is

to be

"PLEASE
> PUT ME ON YOUR MAILING LIST." Now get 6 US $1.00 bills and place ONE
inside
> EACH of the 6 pieces of paper so the bill will not be seen through the
envelope
> (to prevent thievery). Next, place one paper in each of the 6 envelopes
and
> seal them. You should now have 6 sealed envelopes, each with a piece of
paper
> stating the above phrase, your name and address, and a $1.00 bill. What
you are

a

little

checked
> it out with the US Post Office (1-800-725-2161) and they confirmed that it
is

12
> Windsor Cres., North Bay, Ontario, Canada poh 1p0
> #2)  Shane 82 Pawnee Rd. London, ON, Canada N5V 2S8
> #3) Jason 123 Garvin Ave., Elyria, Ohio, 44035
> #4) Billy Hatfield 503 N. 10th Ave. Altoona, Pa 16601
> #5)Kevin K. 64 Tea Rose Ln. Ringgold, GA, 30736
> #6) Jay V. 98 Twigkenham Drive , Richboro Pa 18954
>
> STEP 2: Now take the #1 name off the list that you see above, move the
other
> names up (6 becomes 5, 5 becomes 4, etc....) and add YOUR Name as number 6
on
> the list. STEP 3: Change anything you need to, but try to keep this
article as
> close to original as possible. Now, post your amended article to at least
200
> newsgroups. (I think there are close to 24,000 groups) All you need is
200, but
> remember, the more you post, the more money you make! This is perfectly
legal!
> If you have any doubts, refer to Title 18 Sec. 1302 & 1341 of the Postal

need

participants and

are

have

(Also,

risk of

geometrically

thousands

of the

and

letter to

letter and

the

Step 2)

page.

letter

new

or

forums,

boards

first

30

THE

it!

which is

200
