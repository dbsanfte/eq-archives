Do you understand the concept of a "slippery slope"? Do you understand
that people might be upset not by the fact of the changes themselves,
but rather over what these changes portend for the future of the game?

Ben, forgive me, but you're being an idiot, and bordering on being an
asshole as well.

Clearly, yes, *you* believe people are complaining about these changes
because they're selfish, but that doesn't make it true.

In fact, every high level player considering starting an alt will
benefit from these changes, just as much as a true newbie would. So
much for your tidy little theory about people complaining because they
won't benefit.

No, as a matter of fact, it's not, since the changes in tomorrow's
patch are not the same changes in yesterday's patch.
