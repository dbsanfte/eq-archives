Something is either universal or it isn't.  There's no such thing as 
'more' universal.  Think of it like voting.  42 asserted that the vote was 
not unanimous.  You said, 'yes it was! we have a plurality!'  A plurality 
is not necessarily a majority, and is very far from unanimous.

'Most popular and used' isn't even the same as 'used by the majority', 
much less 'universal'.  I do think IE is used by the majority.  I know for 
a fact it isn't universal, since I don't use it unless forced to, and you 
admit you don't use it, and I only needed -one- counterexample to disprove 
universal and have two already.

}(FWIW: I'm SO not defending IE. Like I've said all along. I'm a firefox

}wanna browswer? Cool. Here, have this suite." Grrrrrr.)

Heh.  You can install just the browser in most versions of Netscape.  
Although in some versions you have to delete the stupid instant 
messenger thingy. :)  I agree that the rest of communicator was pretty 
much crap.

Mozilla!  Mozilla!  I've had sooo few problems with mozilla.  Magelo 
even works with it by default. :) Now if they'd just get my favorite 
molecular visualization plugin to work with it, I'd be in heaven. :)
