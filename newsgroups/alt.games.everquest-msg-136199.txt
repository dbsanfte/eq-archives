Anyone here get involved The Great Knoll Massacre at SFG on Zeboxoruk?  
And anyone know what an AIT GM is?  Someone said that an AIT GM was doing 
rezzes (since anyone below 50 was basically taken out in two swipes - 
there were bout 40 dead PCs in the zone at Blackburrow and the entrance to 
SFG), so I was just wondering.
