Hell levels were great for exploring, becuase they had the smallest 
relative death penalty.  The exp lost by a death is calculated based on 
the exp required for the previous level, which is less than 1/2 the exp 
required for a hell level, rather than 5% less or so in normal levels.  So 
you basically ended up with only 1/2 the penalty.  Made it a great time 
for exploring.
