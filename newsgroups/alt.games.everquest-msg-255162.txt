Then give me a link to the official release statement.

This isn't an official release and you know it, not by what you and I 
both know is meant by "official release". It my be an official build, 
but that's a totally different animal than the game being finished and 
released, OFFICIALLY.

If I'm wrong on that, then provide me with links where they announced 
this "release". Last I checked, the game isn't out. The game is still in 
beta...with an NDA. An NDA which either you or someone else is violating.
