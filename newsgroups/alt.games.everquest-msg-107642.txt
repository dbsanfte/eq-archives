Actually its reinforced almost daily. Don't use canned responses. Give
the impression you care about the player.

*I* don't. When they use a canned response to me I say "Did you read
my petition?" They stop being incompetant and start reading the
petition. It's only happened a couple times, though.

All of whcih is true, but given that you can do exactly the same
simply by asking if they still need out - which gives the impression
you read the petition - its not really relevant.

By the way, all those things take 3 commands and about 5 seconds not
including zoning and requires no interaction with the player at all.

Unlike other CS you have no idea when your petition is first read. A
guide can ask his fellows without giving the player the impression
they're not worth personalized help.

    people die. You are selling things which make people die, but not
    only do they just die, they also become addicted to your product
