Yea, I ran there last night to check it out...a LOT of empty stalls, I
assume for vendors of some kind, and 2 convenient banks with like 4
bankers EACH, but I couldn't seem to figure out how to access any of
the selling functions.    I assumed that Verant hadn't got it working
yet.

There are also very convenient NPC vendors selling all three sizes of
plate armor molds, a vendor selling ALL patterns and other various
convenient tradeskill supplies on vendors.
