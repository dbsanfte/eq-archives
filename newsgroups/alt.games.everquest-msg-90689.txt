Wow .. I had apparently completely ignored the philanthropy of her seemingly
self-serving action.  Perhaps this should serve as a lesson to all.  Don't
med at the docks.  Med on the medding rock near the docks.  Better still,
zone to Nro and med on that side of the zone boundary.  Or just to be really
safe, take it to Freeport.  Oh, and don't be absurd enough to go to the
docks to catch the boat.  Find another way to get where you're
wanting/needing to go.

Only go to the docks if you're a higher level character and you intend to
spend your evening helping idiots (and can't make it to Gfay).

Now I admit, sometimes it's great fun to spend an evening helping idiots.  I
was fortunate to have several people give me good advice and buffs when I
was an idiot in Gfay, and it's fun repaying their kindness.  Give a lvl 2
rogue a walrus tooth you've got lying around in your pack, hit them with
your best Skin, Strength, and Regen, and you've made someone really happy.
Loads of fun when you don't feel like hunting or tradeskilling.

Generally speaking, though, I don't head to Oasis with that mindset.  In
fact, because of behavior like that described in the original post, I try
not to head to Oasis at all.

If you'll look back, I never disagreed that having a wedding at the docks
was, at best, a questionable piece of judgment.  However, the whole practice
of training Deepwater Crocs, SGs, Cazel, Specs, or even a metric buttload of
smaller Crocs to the docks because "everyone there will be sooo excited to
help me they'll be doing backflips when I arrive" is asinine, wedding or no
wedding.  It's the same mindset that makes the WM in LOIO a pain.

btw, the pure sarcasm was nice, though.  I got a chuckle out of it,
actually. :-)
