   No kidding.
   Tonight, I died 4 times in WC.  Got killed repeatedly by some 
psycho dark elf.  Finally, while begging for an invis or _something_
to get my body back before the infamous patch made it go poof 
(and this is the first time I had publicly begged for aid in 
corpse retrieval, and I must say I hated it) a gnome necromancer 
dragged me to the tollbooth.  No payment was discussed, nor, from
my point of view, expected.  
  Still, I gave him all the gold and plat I had on the body, 
(1 pp, 11 gp) and my best treasure, a greater lightstone.  
Total value about 9 to 10 plat.  He seemed happy to get it, 
and I was very happy to get my body back.  But would I have
been in the wrong, or even bannable, if I hadn't even given
him a silver piece?  What if I had promised him 20 plat?  Or
to make it "worth his while", then given him a bat wing?
   Can the system keep track of all the "verbal" contracts
that are constantly being made throughout Norrath, or is always
of case of you word against the other guys?

Annie  <--- Would have paid more for the service if she had it
            on her, btw.
