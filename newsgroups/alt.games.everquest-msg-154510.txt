Each server is a complete, self contained parallel
world, with no physical contact between the
different worlds normally possible, and events
on one world don't affect whats happening on
the others.

You pick any one you like, except the Ledgends
server (Stormhammer) which is more expensive
and comes with some sort of mollycoddling.

Firiona Vie has some different rules on it which
were supposedly designed to encourage role
playing... but largely just make for a world with
a moderately different rules set.

A couple servers with the name Zek allow player
characters to damage or even kill other player
characters for sport, although there seems to
be little point to doing so.

Yep, if you want to move a character from one
world to another, it may be permissible, but you
do so without any equipment... unless you want
to move to the Ledgends server, in which case
I think they give you all your stuff and a nice
lollypop.

Unless you want to pay to move a character, he's on
his server for life.  You, on the other hand...

... can have -different- characters on every sever.  Further,
on all but the Firiona Vie server, you may have up to
8 characters per world on a single account.  You can't
play those characters simultaneously, though, at any given
time each account will only have one character, on one server,
actually active.  People running multiple characters are using
multiple accounts, and most likely multiple machines, to do
so.  It is possible to run more than one account on a single
machine using some "third party software" but this is outside
any warantee the EQ people may provide, and might at any
time be banned or simply stop working.

Unless you really know what you want, I'd advise a single
account on any server other than FV, a Zek, or Stormhammer.
One way to pick a server would be to take a loot at posters
in this newsgroup and see if there are a few you'd like to
share a world with... or perhaps a sensible person would
deliberately look for a world none of the local crazies are
currently admitting to muddying up!
