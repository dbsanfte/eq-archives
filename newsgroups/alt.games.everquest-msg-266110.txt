LOL this is not to be meant as a flame, but if you let something as little
as a pre-order perk change your mind into whether you buy WoW or EQ 2, then
by all means buy WoW. My first impression when reading that was, "Is this
guy serious?". But then after thinking about it for a few, I realized you
were serious and I can't even begin to fathom what might be going through
your mind. I mean EQ 2 is night and day a better game than WoW will ever be
or even hope to be.
