I'd think so, yes, but apparantly the Bush machine are busily spinning 
his exceedingly narrow victory as a Mandate.

More amusingly, they view it as a mandate in favor of his war on Iraq, 
for example, despite the fact that exit polls suggest that on -that- 
issue he was a huge loser, if there's a mandate on that issue its in 
favor of NOT continuing to try and prosecute a war with inadequate 
forces and scarcely any international cooperation.

He's not going to look at it that way, though, heck, if he was the sort 
of person to see reason, I might have voted for him as so many others 
did.  Or at least not voted against him, and even that would have 
increased his winning margin (fewer against votes means a larger margin too)
