Umm, which is what, exactly?  What did they fix, how do they "intend"
for it to work?  If its the stacking issue, then it should effect more
than just Warcry.

Its also sad to see that they -still- aren't addressing the general 
uselessness of the Berserker class post 55... other than by adding 5 
more levels for the class to be useless in:)

Another patch without the bard Melody going live?  Of course as someone 
else commented, it should be called Medley, not Melody, perhaps thats 
what's taking so long.

Is it me, or is this the smallest patch in living memory?  I thought EQ2 
was using a completely different team, whats sapping the energy from the 
meddlers over at EQ1?
