Druid is one probably. Only 2 steps you would need help are the reavers in
EK and Feydedar, both triggered.
Monk Epic is also pretty much triggerable for any nasty fights. For the
Rogue epic is only the general kill which you can't do solo and that trigger
is up almost 100% of the time.

Mostly if your epic requires a planer drop you can bet it's damn hard to
schedule it. Shaman need a piece from PoFear but getting the golems up is
almost as hard as just killing Gorenoire over and over again (like for pally
epic).

I'm not sure why you ask this question though. If you want to know the
easiest epic, go for rogue or druid. Shaman if your guild can wipe fear np.
Cleric epic is also pretty fast, especially if your guild can do a Chardok
run in under an hour :).

If you want a real challenge go for SK or Mage epic. Both requre stupendous
long camps and lots of ultra-rare drops of mobs you can't solo quite well.
Any epic involving drops from PoSky is also basically a royal biatch (war,
necro, mage, sk, ranger).

YMMV
