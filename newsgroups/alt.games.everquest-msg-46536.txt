Ummm, why not?
Most end game mobs don't fear, and even if they do, at level 59+ you
have that fearless pet spell.

Against, single big mob encounters, now that they "fixed" the pet
aggro, Joboner is actually dishing out solid damage.  Just make sure
you position him *BEHIND* the mob or Joboner will get ganked from the
ripostes.

Mod rods.
Every 2 mod rods you poop out, is one extra CH on a big fat tank.
