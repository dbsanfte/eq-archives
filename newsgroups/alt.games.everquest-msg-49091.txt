Eight spell slots is a game balance issue, not a interface issue; they want you

to juggle spells in and out, they want meditate skill to mean something to
you, they want you to consider a lower level spell in swap slot just for the
mem time... You may not like it, but its how the magic system is -supposed- to
work.

On the other hand, the six slots in normal mode versus ten slots for
transparant mode is clearly -not- a game issue.  That irritating "you are
a druid" animation is a complete waste of space, and I'd really like
the ten slots instead, along with some of the other functionality
they've added to the full screen mode... but I cannot, in any way,
play the game in full screen.  My brain can't process the information
in a heads up format.  I need blank space behind the chat window,
health bars, and so forth.  I've talked to quite a few other people
who say the same thing... and others who just have slower machines
and need the lower overhead that initial mode provides.
