1) Monks do not equal warriors in damage, they leave them in
    the dust.  Monks/rogues do equal damage, unless the rogue is
    behind the mob and can backstab, then the rogue outdamages
    the monk, too.  Warriors don't even deal damage like a ranger,
    sometimes.

2) Warriors are _the_ tank.  Some will argue that a SK/Paly can
    taunt better with damage + spells, but nobody can tank an
    Ubermob without warrior hps and warrior disciplines. On the
    opposite side, monks _often_ have a higher AC than an equal
    level warrior.  Monks also block and dodge at a much higher
    rate than other melee classes.  It's just that their AC is more
    weighted to the "damage avoidance" end of the spectrum, and
    more hits against them that _do_ hit end up hitting harder.

3) Warriors get taunt.  Monks get FD. Rangers get tracking.
    Rogues get evade.  Not all classes need a taunt, because
    that's not their place in the group.

If you wanted lower damage in exchange for increased hps,
higher damaged absorption, and no ability to FD or mend, you
should have played a warrior.  I do know several warriors
who would like to Mend, and several rogues who would
like to FD occasionally :-)...
