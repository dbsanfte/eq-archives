Has anyone else notice a shift in your server population spots since Verant
has removed the population of online users. I am on Prexus which used to be
one of the most heavily populated servers. I still sort by population and
now it seems Prexus is a mid-range in population. It shifts up and down some
but never to the bottom anymore my question is where did everyone go?

Be careful of the toes you step on today.
They may be connected to the ass you
will be kissing tomorrow.
