PoP also offers the ability to cross short distances safely and
easily.

I've been watching the newbies lately, and they don't even bother
to walk from Kelethin to Kaladim to turn in belts and pads anymore.
They use the books.

I raced someone from the druid ring in BBM to the Kelethin bank.
I was SoW'd and knew the fastest (non-road) routes.  They were
un-SoW'd and took the books.

They beat me by a mile.
