That is just stupid. I mean what is the point of making me port to Gfay and
wait for 15mins for that damned Scoin whore to port me to the same place I
was going to gate? Makes no sense to me other than forcing me to go afk for
15mins or nuke passing bats into dust.

On a more positive note, maybe the new portals in SoL will "fix" this
obviously stupid problem. Sheesh.
