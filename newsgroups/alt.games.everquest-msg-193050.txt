I think it would make me want to attend and volunteer to help with
events put on by the cable company. The person was rewarded for doing
something for SOE, it's not like some GM just decided to pick random
person and give uberweapon to him or her. Maybe this is also trying to
be an incentive for people to come to the Fan Faire, and maybe help
out. And if I can't attend said Fan Faire, then that's my problem and
not the fault of SOE or those who can attend.
