Its probably been brought up before similarly, but you know whats funny...
When friends ask where you were all night and you tell them you were
'partying' till 2AM. Then they think you are wild and crazy till they find
out you were actually just camping derv spawn in North Ro with an EQ group
till all hours of the night... Then its just sad. But then not to you... But
thats kinda sad too.
