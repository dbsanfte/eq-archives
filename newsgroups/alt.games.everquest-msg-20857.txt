    Thank you, Lokari. ;-)

    Of course I am. Bizbee, what do you think was the point of the rule: to
methodically weed out all names that Verant thinks shouldn't be in game, or
to try and weed out names that ruin the roleplaying experience, the "fun",
for players? I feel it's the latter. And if the name I see doesn't bother me
enough to "ruin my roleplaying experience", then I don't petiton it. People
who are friends ADD to my enjoyment of the game - of course I'm going to be
more lenient with them!

    If the point of the name rule was the former, well, call me a
conscientious objector. ;-)

    James
