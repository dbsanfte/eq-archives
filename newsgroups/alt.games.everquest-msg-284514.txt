Ok I have been playing EQ for years over a firewall, and until Saturday
never had a problem. Well at first I thought it was a "stuck
character", but after about 5 moves and a call to SoE Tech Support on
Monday, it was obvious that there was a firewall problem, but it made
no sense to me. All of the sudden a character I was playing cannot be
accessed, but every other character on that account works fine? Tech
Support said they send random UDP and TCP packets that get mistaken for
Port Attacks by Firewalls, and I needed to remedy the situation by
relaxing some rules I had set up on the firewall. WTF? I didn't set up
any rules on my firewall..well none I know of, but there are probably
normal checks for attacks.

Well I have a Symantec Gateway 320, and to say it is a monster is an
understatement. I have tried twinking with the settings on it for
hours. I have tried to set it up so that all it does is route, but that
did not work. I have tried to set it up so that my computer is ignored
but it wasn't. Has anyone else got this firewall and got EQ working. Oh
yeah Tech Support for SoE also sent me a bunch of server addresses, and
ports to leave open (1024-65534 both TCP and UDP). Basically they are
telling me DONT USE A FIREWALL. I did try to look for a DMZ button,
there is a NAT disable clicky but that does not work right, and neither
does "Enable Exposed Host:". That or I am not doing it right.

Of course the Tech guy emailed me a list of servers EQ uses, but these
seem out of date:

64.37.148.*
64.37.149.*
64.37.150.*
64.37.151.*
64.37.156.*
64.37.157.*
195.33.132.*
195.33.108.*
195.33.133.*
199.108.1.*
199.108.2.*
199.108.3.*

But cazicthule.everquest.com does go to  199.108.3.30. Wondering what I
am supposed to do with these if anyone can explain. Am I supposed to
enter these numbers some place?

Anyone else had a similar problem and hopefully a solution? Any help
would be appreciated.
