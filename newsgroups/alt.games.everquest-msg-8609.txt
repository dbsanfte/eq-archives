Of course, if you had done this repeatedly in the presence of a GM, you
would have had a little talk with him for purposefully interrupting
someone's battle.

Say I run by with a quad-kite, and somehow one decides you look tastier than
me, and attacks you, though I'm trying to get his attention again. You root
him and atone, causing me to wait until root breaks to get my kite back. In
the meanwhile, I end up dying.

On my way to my corpse, I notice your group fighting three mobs at once, two
are mezzed. At a safe distance, I cast Nullify Magic on both of them,
breaking the mez and getting your group killed.

OR, I run by and your group is fear kiting. I cast nullify magic and remove
the fear every time it's put back on, and your group ends up dying.

Is that fair?

Accidents happen. Purposefully trying to get someone killed because of an
accident is just stupid, and bad behavior. It can also get you suspended or
banned.
