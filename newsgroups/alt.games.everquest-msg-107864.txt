Alternately, clerics shouldn't symbol tanks that don't provide reagents.

Nah, though this does remind me of the problem with only eight spells on the
gem window.  I'd like to see them make a second gem window (maybe four gems
deep) that would only hold buffs.  Having to re-mem buffs every five minutes
only adds a little more difficulty, and alot more irritation.  It fails the
risk vs annoyance test.

Agreed on the FD camping.  There's a workaround anyways, so why not just go
ahead and lower the irritation factor.

Strongly seconded.  Along with the concept that any mob that can take you
down to one red bubble (after applying LoH and using all your mana) should
give you XP (glares at Gix).  It seems risk vs. reward only applies to
nerfing players.

I think twinking has masked some of this.  Stuff that used to be good, and
measure up in the R vs. R scale is considered trash now days.  Pitty, there
are some cool quests for some formerly-decent gear (the falchon from the
Felwith Paladin's guild, or the Shining Star of Light, for instance).

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
