Go to EC and/or Faymart and look for somebody selling a langesax. You can get
one for WAY less than the money you have. Will increase your speed (and thus
damage, with a better ratio) plus it's magic.  There's some blackened iron, or
if you're very lucky, blackened alloy swords out there flooding the market since
the new wave of farmers moved into Liberated Runnyeye. You may find one of them
cheap.  As to a shield in your price range, depending what you spend on the
sword, you could look for a Cracked Darkwood Shield or a Chiton Shield. Any
combination of thse items should be a nice upgrade for you and not terribly
expensive.
