Woot!  Welcome to the silly side!  Continue to do your quests, even if
you can get better armor cheaper by buying it.  Doing the armor quests
will not only force you to hunt in many, many places you wouldn't
ordinarily hunt, but will also introduce you to numerous folks you
wouldn't meet otherwise.  Also, take every opportunity to talk to
higher level bards.  My best friend in game is a bard who I met when
she was level 20 doing Lambent quests and ended up a few PP short to
complete an item.  She started chatting with me, I loaned her 20pp for
10 minutes, and became her mentor.

The best advice I can give any new bard is to check out EQDiva,
www.eqdiva.com.  The song lists are great, the item database is great,
and the forums are probably the best of any class site.  Bards may not
crunch numbers like min/maxxing monks, but we'll discuss the finer
points of songs until the last server is unplugged.

At the end game bards are truly desired at raids.  The Luclin
expansion gave bards several AE songs which allowed a single bard to
buff an entire raid, yet other songs (especially the mana drain) added
even more reason to have multiple bards on a raid.
I've found that a good bard gets a group as fast as any class, in any
exp zone in the game.  While you don't bring as much damage to a group
as some classes, or as much healing, or as many buffs, or as many
debuffs, the fact that you have such a wide variety of skills will
allow a good bard to fit in anywhere.
My aforementioned best in-game friend and I recently were goofing off
and decided to make a 2-bard duo.  We were doing very well, but an old
friend and former guildie (left game, ebayed his account, came back
and started over) with a 53 warrior wanted to join.  He brought a
shaman with him, and between 53 warrior, 58 shaman, 57 bard, and 60
bard we completely owned the zone.  We were able to break rooms that
I've seen full groups level 57+ fail to.  We were able to kill so
fast, and with so much impunity that we were holding literally 4
seperate camps, and make fun of the 6 level 58+ classes claiming to
hold all the camps we were pulling from.  
My favorite group ever was 4 bards, a beastlord, and a cleric
(replaced by a shaman later in the day).  We completely owned all of
Sebalis from Guard on down.  I honestly can't think of another class
that stacks so well.  Sure we're not as good tanking as *real* tanks,
but my AC is better than probably 50% of the warriors I group with, my
weapons certainly hold up against other classes, and I can offer more
to a group than any other single class.  
Learn what each and every song does.  Just last night I was waiting
for replacement for my group, and duoing with a warrior.  I pulled out
a song I hadn't used in literally a year, and was able to ensure that
I took almost no damage.  I was also able to give the warrior
75hp/tick regen (OK, I had to loan him my fungi, but still).  By the
same token I've been able to duo with every single class in the game,
just by changing my song line-up.
The real trick to being a bard is learning how your songs stack with
other classes.  A good bard will be a true force-multiplier, adding
whatever is needed to a group, be it melee damage, slows, hastes, mana
regen, buffs, mob debuffs, or whatever else.  A bad bard is still
desired for mana regen if nothing else.  Learn you songs, learn how
they stack, and learn what to sing if grouped with another bard, then
learn how the songs you get from levels 25-27 completely change being
a bard.  You'll learn to love charming, and quickly realize that for a
grouping class, you can solo as well if not better than any of the
classic soloing classes.
