Actually, wouldn't you want pacify, for the single pulling?

Oh, a little birdy that is a drooling Blizzard fanboi tells me 
Soulbinding items in WoW also mean the EQ 'lore', so you would have to 
farm them one at a time. I have no way to confirm that though, and I 
think I may have looted two soulbinding axes during beta, though perhaps 
not at the same time... wasn't paying attention.

When I mean loot mode master loot, I mean the person designated as loot 
master is the only one that can loot monsters killed by the group. Noone 
else get's the 'this is a corpse you can loot' sparklies. Round robin 
loot only allowed each person to loot in turn (though there was a 
variation... if there was a quest item that I had all of I needed, and 
someone else needed, and it was my turn to loot, we could both loot the 
monster. He can loot the quest item, I get to loot everything else. I 
imagine master loot works the same.)
