Why?  If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  A Pentium 166, running windows 95
with 32 megs of RAM is still more processing power than a lot of computer
users need.  If all you're doing is writing email, browsing websites, and
playing a couple of non-system-intensive games (like the original EQ, and
possibly Kunark), it's perfectly reasonable that you should expect the
afforementioned Win95 box to be more than adequate for your needs.  There's
absolutely no reason for Microsoft to put out a new operating system every
two years or so, when the same thing could be accomplished just as easily
through the use of freely available fixpacks and system software updates.

UNIX is a 25+ year old operating platform which, for some bizarre reason,
can still do things that NT is still dreaming of.  Ok...  A 20 year old
operating system that's undergone several updates and revisions and
modifications and specification changes as well as certifications in the
last 25 years... But um...  Anyway...  I'm going to hide now.
