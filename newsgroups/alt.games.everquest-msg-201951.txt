Snare and root stack now, that might be different since the last time you
played.  It makes it brain dead simple to solo a druid.  It's almost too
easy--the tradeoff is that it's also BORING.

On the other hand, DOT's now do full damage when a mob is moving towards
you.  They did when the game launched, they nerfed it shortly after that,
then unnerfed it relatively recently.
