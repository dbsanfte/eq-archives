My guild is 95% American !

Anyway, there was a discussion recently about why just 1 guild on Prexus has
such a stronghold on Luclin and Velious (Id say 99% of all pops, 100% of
some specifc pops, have been killed by 1 guild-no exageration)...  the
general excuse people came up with was "they have 30 people online at noon
EST when servers come up, 50 online before a rival guild has 10.."

Well, the last 2 Emps we've killed were at some ungodly hour even for the
yanks (3am EST)

Whatever time the server goes down and comes up, Emp is ours !
