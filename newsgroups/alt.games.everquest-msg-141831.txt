The ornate chain is the one where he only has a limited supply of the ore,
and its a stupid farm quest just to get him to re-supply

god damn can they make it any longer?
Just to make sure im reading it right..  actually after thinking about it, i
have no clue how to read it.

Take for example the top one though...

"blessed sickle blade sheet metal, smithy hammer, celestial essence, blessed
dust of tunare, emerald, mistletoe temper, curved blade mold   183"

I can just make this over and over and over and over until I hit 170+?
Whatever it results in (I assume something which would then be used for
another combine in the long ass potc earring)

i have a 122 pottery skill

>and the brewed temper -

brewed as in made with brewing, or thats its name?  girlf has a 250 brewing
skill

But then what are the items called that I'd be looking for?  What would be a
reasonable payment for gettin somebody to do enough of the above to get me
to 170
