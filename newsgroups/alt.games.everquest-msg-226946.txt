Step one:  signed up to Legends service with 20 days left on regular
account. That balance *poofed* off the ether never to be seen again.

Step two:  the 30 free days from registering my Evolutions also *poofed* off
into the ether due to having Legends subscriptions - never to eb seen again.

Step three: I now have some shithead from SOE saying I now cannot move any
characters back of Stormhammer till the 28th Dec even though my legends
service has finished.

Step four: anyone want to take a guess?
