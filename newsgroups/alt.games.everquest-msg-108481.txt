Your 16% argument is absurd.  You are taking a level 39 cleric and
saying he'll get the opportunity to heal a 6k warrior.  The only time
a level 39 cleric will even SEE a 6k warrior is when one is running
past him to Velk's while he's hunting kodiaks.

Much more likely is that the 39 cleric is healing a 2k warrior.  At 39
a druid has Greater Healing, which makes him about 40% as efficient as
a cleric casting CHeal on a 2k warrior.

At least argue intelligently.  We aren't idiots.
