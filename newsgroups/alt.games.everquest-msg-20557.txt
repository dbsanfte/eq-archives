I usually cast phantom chain AFTER a bad solo fight, to recoup
the lost hp (ok, any fight you walk away from isn't bad :).
On another magician note, the bug with the double bolts is still
out there, and it ends up hurting me as often as helping.  Sure
It's nice when a double hits and a tigress that's 60% dead keels
over.  A lot less nice when you stand and drop a double on a
tiger that's 60% dead, and it comes for you with blood in it's eyes.
I had read (from Absor) that the double bolt was an illusion, and
didn't actually do double damage, but after seeing a lot of them
on Monday, I'm a believer.  When I wait for a tiger to get to 60%
and drop a bolt, it doesn't usually aggro.  When I get a double,
it aggros every time.
