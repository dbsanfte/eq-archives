At the same time, I'm willing to bet people who don't enjoy getting
into flamewars or listening to the fanboys probably don't read the
Blizzard forums.  Both serve as an outlet for discussion, just one is
more mature than the other, and would attract a different crowd.  I
would bet large amounts of cash that the 80%+ of the WoW players
'contributing' to the Blizzard forums that wouldn't read any other
sources are part of the group from BNet that others try to avoid :P
