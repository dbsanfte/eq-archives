	Regrettably.

	And it seems to be the only alignment endorsed by EQ's designers.
Frinstance, there's a nice quiver being given out as a quest reward in Seru --
a faction which no Ranger in the game should have any reason for helping,
doubly so since the quest is little more than an assassination contract.  And
no one but a Ranger will care about what quiver they're using.
