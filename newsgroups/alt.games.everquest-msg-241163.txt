Hm, i *didnt* notice signing up for access and getting given a faq to 
read up front. I also havent noticed any regularly [weekly] faq being 
psoted to the list. Most other groups I am on post their faq weekly or 
monthly.

hm, I seem to remember some serious flaming. I dont remember the first

Other than I hate cigars and dont smoke, if I saw a sign saying No 
Smoking, I wouldnt smoke. There is no weekly posted faq to this group. 
Instead you have a cadre of flameholes jumping on peoples sh!t instead 
of politely asking someone to read the weekly faq and please follow it.

*Maybe if you did, and behaved civilly by asking people to read this 
weekly faq, this group would look more like a comunity instead of an 
alt.flamehole.convention sometimes.*

Not rebelling against the system, I simply am objecting to the initial 
response to a VERY SMALL foible to be flaming assh*ledom.
