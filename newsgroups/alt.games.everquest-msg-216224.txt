I think at the high end an ogre shaman would probably come out as best.  The
ability to get a second slow off while tanking the mob that resisted the
first slow may be the most useful thing to a high end shaman.  Shamans
having shrink mostly eliminates one of the ogre's biggest disadvantages.

Ogres have a big exp penalty, though, so it's a long road to get to the high
end.
