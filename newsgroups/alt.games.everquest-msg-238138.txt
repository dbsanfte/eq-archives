You can certainly play two characters on the same machine.  You install
Everquest, then use another program called EQWindows, which allows you to
run Everquest in a window instead of full screen.  Everquest actually has
the ability to go to windowed mode now, but I don't think it works as well
as EQWindows when you want to run two accounts on one system.  You use
EQWindows to start an EQ session in a window, then start EQWindows again to
open another Everquest session.  You can then alt-tab between sessions.  The
definition of a 'bot' will vary, but I generally consider it any character
that is primarily being run to aid another character or characters.  For
example, you might already have a warrior on one account but find that you
can't solo.  You could then level up a cleric "bot" on the second account
whose primary role is to heal and buff the warrior.  I leveled up a druid
bot whose role was to give me SoW on demand while I was hunting.  Then, as
someone else mentioned, there is the association of the word 'bot' with
cheating - characters that are being controlled with macro programs that are
against the EULA.  The macro programs can record keystrokes and mouse-clicks
and then replay them over and over again, allowing you to automate
repetitious tasks.  Sometimes these macroing programs have been
sophisticated enough to allow characters to actually repeatedly kill
experience mobs over and over again with no outside intervention from a real
person.  You set up the macro program to repeatedly kill mob "X", go to bed,
and when you wake up your character has spent 8 hours xping.  Of course,
there is the danger that if something goes wrong and you die, you'll stay
online long enough that your rez timer will expire or that someone will
notice your repetitious behavoir, alert a GM, who will deduce that you're
using an forbidden macro program and give you a warning or suspension.
