LOL  thats kinda funny...crappy soloers?  druids?  I agree with the healing
aspect, except that they do have chloroblast which was a nice addition.  As
soloers druids rock.

You have various options on how you wanna solo. 1) snare, dot, run - single
mob 2) root, dot, med - single/double/triple 3) snare/dot/fear (if its an
animal), or my favorite 4) quadkiting :)  Killing 4 mobs in one shot yielded
a blue and a half  to half a blue each quad (if it was less than 3/4 of a
blue/quad i would go to the new spot to quad.)  Quadding kicks butt if you
are trying to lvl fast, but it gets awfully borning.  I got my druid to L53
by basically quadding once I got the aoe spell (L29 I think).  IMO druids
are borning anyways...he is just my tp'r....my L60 monk is a lot more fun :)
