In this particular case however they duplicated the bug that occurred 
when the last expansion was preordered.  That is inexcusable.  Bugs do 
happen, you cannot test for everything.  Generally speaking, where I 
work, when a problem is identified that was not caught by the testing 
procedures, the procedures are modified so that it won't happen next 
time.
