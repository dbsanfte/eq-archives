Keep you advice to yourself friend, and re-read what I wrote, I saiud
exactly what I meant. I'll play what I want to play, and I'll play it in the
manner I so desire, thank you very much.  RP'ing is one thing, but taking up
MY playing time by bitching at me about MY lack of RP'ing will certainly get
you a verbal thrashing, or put to /ignore. I don't have a problem with
roleplaying, but rather with assholes that want to run my character as well
as their own.

I don't have any trouble at all playing/grouping with RP'ers, and am capable
of RP'ing  myself when the mood strikes me. I determine how I play the game
though, not someone elses ideas of "roleplay".

My avatars have grouped with many, and are repeatedly re-invited into
groups. I have a host of friends across Norrath, and I daresay that would be
impossible to do if I were hard to get along with. I'm not though... you
play your way, I'll play mine. I don't berate anyone for RP'ing, I berate
them for infringing on my playing time and trying to determine how I play
the game.
