There are no spider silks in Feerrot. Only spiderling silks.  Every spider,
from the lowliest spiderling to the mightiest jungle spider, drops
spiderling
silk.  While the spawn rate on the eight legged crew is indeed decent
usually,
the reason the zone is prized (or once was) was as a source for spiderling
silk, used in smithing FS plate.

Unfortunately the bottom dropped out of the FS plate market with a recent
patch that lowered its trivial level down to the point of a joke.

Now Feerrot is the place to AVOID for silk farming, since that now means
spider silk, not spiderling.

You don't state your level, so I can't really tell you where to hunt
spiders...
UGuk and EK are both good solid silk sources you might look into, in fact
I'd say for a tracker EK is the best source at any level if its not heavily
farmed at the time.
