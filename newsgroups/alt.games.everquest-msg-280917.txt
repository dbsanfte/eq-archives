No thanks - it's an interesting concept and I really empathise with
it, but that ship has sailed. True, I found the game far more exiting
in the "good old days" but trying to turn the clock back is futile -
neither nostalgia nor Vows Of Virtual Poverty will breathe new life
into EQ.  The game is stale and monotonous, unless, that is, you're a
virtual demi-god who can romp around the newer expansions, heh.
Playing with one hand tied behind your back for 50 levels is just
going to make a game that has never overhauled the content of the
original gaming zones even more boring.

It *was*, yes, but that was then and this is now. Sadly these days,
there just aren't enough *players* in the game to form handy groups,
making soloing the norm for most people - whether they are in a Guild
already or not. (My guild has 600+ characters on it's roster, and
you're lucky to see 10 to 12 in the game at any one time - and you can
usually count on 3 or 4 of those being Bazaar mules)  With just
equipment and weapons you can pick up from your own kills, or get from
quests, you'll have a hell of a job on trying to solo a Drakkel Wolf!

In addition, almost everyone is a "Lunch Money Twink" nowadays, and
they are all out there, *easily* soloing stuff "X" levels higher than
they should be able to and thereby maximising their XP rate.  This has
got even easier now that cheap Potions are available for SoW, Healing,
Haste and Clarity - who *needs* a group when you can buy these and
also have a spree in the Bazaar for equipment?  My lvl 36 'Zerker can
solo Zelniaks in Dawnshroud virtually non-stop, which is ridiculous if
you think back to how it used to be.

Yes, and as I have observed already, that's the way the game is
actually played nowadays, for good or ill. 

>the ED approach certainly isn't the only valid way to play.

The ED way is valid, but dragging out the length of time spent in the
very zones that are the most stale and uninteresting, by deliberately
handicapping yourself, is just *not* going to make EQ any more
enjoyable.  Good luck though  :)
