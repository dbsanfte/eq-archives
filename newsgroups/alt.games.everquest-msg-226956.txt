I'll take your word for it, since I'm one of those folks who has done some
raiding, shrugged "is that all this is?", and gone back to the aspects of EQ
that we enjoy enough to invest hours at a stretch into.

Sure -- the difference being that rangers do other things useful in, for
instance, LDoN grouping. (Having done more than 100 LDoN adventures and
grouped with people who've done far more, there is a clear consensus on my
server that boxes and crates do not have rewards suitable to the pains in
the ass that they can cause, and are to be simply ignored).

To be clear: I don't dislike rogues, and I invite them into my groups all
the time. I was just making the observation that in the non-raiding portions
of EQ, rogues seem to be treated by most players as more or less an
afterthought -- I see a rogue wandering around for extended stretches
/oocing without getting invited, more often than all other classes put
together. This was true back in the day when I was exp grouping in places
like OT and DSP, and it's true now in LDoN including the 60+ range my main
is in now.

Raiders think that raiding is the only true EQ experience and the rest of
the game is just training for raiding....but anyway if rogues are essential
for that purpose, great. Perhaps that's the class balance that Sony has
settled on for them.
