In this particular case his "rule" was an attempt to describe a
condition that exists completely apart from the "rule", while
your parking regulation example attempts to impose itself on the
world.  Descriptive rules differ markedly from proscriptive rules,
specificly in the sense that the burden of "proof" is on the other
side of the fence.  This makes your example deceptive in context,
regardless of its out of context accuracy.
