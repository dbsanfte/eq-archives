Taper Enchantment doesn't remove anything - but it does shorten the duration
of the mob's top buff.  Not worth much; dispells work better.  But at level
1, you take what you can get.  :)  These days, it's one of my choices for a
low-aggro pull spell - it's practically free, casts fast, and has almost no
aggro.  Haven't used it much since I got Boggle, I will admit.
