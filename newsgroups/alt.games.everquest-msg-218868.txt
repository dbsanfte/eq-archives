   From what I understand, Isaac Newton died a virgin.  He was a nasty, vicious
and vindictive jerk of a tool.  Not someone that many people would put on their
"friends" list.  And yet, he had a brilliant mind.  I'm not trying to say that
Dark Tyger is anything like Isaac Newton (I dunno if he's any good at math at
all).  I'm saying that attacking someone's social skills rather than their
arguments is simply not constructive.  Maybe Fred is the nicest person in the
world, and has women throwing themselves at him because he is so kind and
supportive.  But if he stoutly believes that the reason people don't fly of the
face of the earth as it spins is because we have iron in our blood, and the
earth's core is magnetic therefor keeping us in place, he is not somehow more
correct when debating with Isaac who maintain that is is gravity that is the
deciding factor in this case.

   Sometimes I give into my baser instincts and watch Jerry Springer.  And
invariably when I do, my thoughts turn to the surprise that some of the people
who appear managed to find anyone who was willing to share bed space with them,
much less a mother, her daughter, and three of his cousins with the surprise of
on of their boyfriends thrown in for a twist.  I have come to the conclusion
that anyone can find someone.

   I'm reminded of the famous Getsumj.  He and I were playing on Drinal at the
same time.  I don't know if we grouped or not (pretty sure we did), but I know
we conversed fairly often.  He would help me if he saw he could, anytime,
without my asking.  If he recognized one of my alts, he would ask if she needed
any supplies.  And as far as I know, he did not have a bad reputation on Drinal
at all (and if he did, I think I would have known about it).  I liked him,
really.  But I think you will have a hard time finding anyone else on this
newsgroup who can say that.  Here, he was one of the most obnoxious
personalities that AGE has endured.  I was quite taken back.

   Quite possibly.  I've already admitted I don't understand the motivation.

   Lenny swears like a retired sailor, and yet he found some floozy desperate to
stay married to him for almost 18 years.
