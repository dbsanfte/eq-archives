I'm guessing you have never:

Gone LD in a close fight.
Had your ISP go down on a CR.
Lose Power!!!  (I now don't play during thunder storms)
Fallen asleep while playing (Normally a side-effect of Drinking EQ)
Had a RL obligation pull the plug (I now don't play on my anniversary,
birthdays, christmas...)

Tuls.
