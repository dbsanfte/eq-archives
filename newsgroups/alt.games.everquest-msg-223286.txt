Maybe you shouldn't say anything if you aren't sure, hmm?
Anyway, checking on Alla's....

Shadow Wolf Paw, required for Prime Healer Initiate Breastplate, Silent Fist
Robes, Rainkeeper Gauntlets, Stormhealers Greaves, and Arcane Order Gloves.

Cut and Paste from last post there....

Just got 2 shadow wolf paws after trying to get them from shadow wolf's for
2 days.  Now hear this - the shadow wolf paws is dropped in West Karanas by
Black Wolf, not Shadow Wolf. Here's the location:

-1246.31, -10318.46, 346.07

There were 4 black wolves lined up - 2 dropped shadow wolf paws and,
contrary to popular belief, they are not NO-DROP!!!!!


Hope this helps the OP.
