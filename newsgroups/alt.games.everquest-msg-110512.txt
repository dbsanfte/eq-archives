Of course, the level headed ones are the ones that are likely to play their
class well, and by extention:

1)  Know exactly how poweful a druid truely is, and
2)  Don't want to attract attention by clammoring for more power, as they
know they're just as likely to attract the nerf-bat.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
