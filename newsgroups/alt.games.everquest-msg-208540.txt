There's a place to turn that off in the options menu, if you're
worried about whether EQ can manage to use the system calls to
query that info without damaging your system (nevermind that
they're making millions of system calls directly and indirectly
everytime you play the game, better worry about whether they make
those particular queries).  The problems with LDoN have to do with
how SOE [mis]manages their internal databases.  And the reason I
got irritated enough to rant about it (I usually poke fun at those
who rant against SOE) is that they already managed to fuck up in
the same damned way with LoY, there's just no excuse for making
this particular mistake all over again.  This is the sort of BS
that should get managers and their bosses fired.
