Hell, I've never even played WoW but I'll call bullshit on this one.
(I *have* heard my wife and other friends discuss it ad nauseum. :-)
There are certainly more variations than just healing vs DPS, though
I don't know which classes have which choices.  But warriors can be
spec'ed for DPS or for tanking, and there may be other choices (either
a combination of DPS and tankage, or other axes entirely, I don't know).

And frankly, I find combats in EQ are often closer to the "same few
buttons" approach.  Sure, if I'm in a group I may have to adapt to
situations when we have adds or a mob has a DS or summons or whatever.
But in a raid battle when all I care about is DPS, I mostly play
whack-a-mole with the same few buttons, plus throwing in a few combat
discs (where I usually have to choose between discs that share a
cooldown timer).  And yes, some tactics change depending on the mob,
and I'm sure the tanks have more choices to think about.  But I think
both games have their share of "fall into the rhythm and grind out the
fight".

Mostly, I suspect that neither game can be fairly evaluated except by
someone who's played it at the higher levels.
