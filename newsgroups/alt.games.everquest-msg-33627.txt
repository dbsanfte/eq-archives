Make sure you have all the other pieces FIRST. The item you get from the
shadowed men is NO RENT, meaning it will disappear if you log out / go
LD, etc. Once you get it, you need to hightail it to Temple of Sol Ro. 

I remember when I did this quest, my friend and I had gotten the item
from the shadowed men camp in SK. On the run to Lavastorm, I was having
horrible packetloss and almost went LD 10 times - several of them in
Kithicor at night. Was lucky, though, and made it fine. But man, I was a
nervous wreck for that half hour run.
