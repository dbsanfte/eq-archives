Well, I can understand them now.  Last night, I finally found a couple
people selling the level 55 Druid spell "Girdle of Karana".  I had that
spell drop in Skyfire a few days ago, but couldn't find anyone selling it,
so had no idea what it was worth.  Now, however, I had a ballpark price, and
so happily set about becoming a trader for a couple hours.

Oops...my server was at the trader limit.

Since the Bazaar does not have the capacity to allow everyone who wants to
sell to actually sell, it makes sense that people will turn to the old
method of shout/ooc/auction.  And what zone is most logical for that?  I'd
say it is a toss up between the Bazaar, the Nexus, and PoK.
