Yeah, but as I have no use for organized (or disorganized for that
matter) religion, I do not pray to Jesus with my mouth. I also don't
have an embolism when people use profanity in any context.

As for your repeated assertion that "bluenose" refers to a sea bass,
it does not. "Blue nose" probably does, but "bluenose" is a slang term
for a Puritanical person, probably derived from the Nova Scotian
nickname for themselves. Its most famous usage was probably when
Charles Krauthammer said, "Bluenoses demand restraint against the porn
and violence that are the staple of popular culture."

Pedantery is all well and good, but you might try getting your facts
first.
