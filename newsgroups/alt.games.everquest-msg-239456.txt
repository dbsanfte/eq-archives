I've tried AO a couple times, both free trials... 

I agree entirely that their CS is stellar... even in the bad-old-days
... they may have had serious problems but their attitude was always
right. SOE could learn from that.

I never really got into it; I found it rather like EQ currently is at
the low levels... you create a new erudite necro and you wander a
deserted city, into a deserted hunting area, and from their can get to
two more deserted hunting areas... hi level characters zip by at
insane speed on their mysterious errands of their own. My experience
with AO was like that... I just didn't know where to go to find
someone to hang with as a newbie.

Perhaps its different now... EQ has its PoK...and gfay/cb is always
crowded (at least on my server) but you sort of have to know where to
look now-a-days.

I'd be willing to give AO another whirl though.. the price is right =)
