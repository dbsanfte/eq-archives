Naw, page 8 just refers to that thread.  But people in the thread were 
comparing Morsereg to that guy from the Usual Suspects.  Mighta been about 
page 15 or so. :)

Oh, no, let me rephrase that:  Buscemi's character in Reservoir Dogs was 
such a whiner.  I love Buscemi.  He plays whiners so well. :)  I wouldn't 
know about Armageddon, though, being the last living American who hasn't 
seen it. :)
