Hi everyone, Im over in OT right now and I keep foraging up wet clay, what
is it used for?  If its nothing Im going to get rid of it because it does
not stack.  Oh and another question is, what is a good lvl 31 druid quest?
I've been looking and cannot find any decent druid quests on the net, I will
not pay for Alakazam <sp>, so I cannot look there anymore.  Thanks for any
info I receive.  Have a nice day.

Sheri  :)
