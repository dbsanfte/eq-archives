Im about to buy a new graphics card,
I currently have a voodoo 3 3000 and i am thinking of a Geforce 2 MX as the
next step?
I dont think that the Geforce 2 GTS or Ultra will offer much more
performance with EQ at this point? although i know both cards will blow away
the MX.
Does anyone have any experience of any of these cards?

Thanks in Advance
