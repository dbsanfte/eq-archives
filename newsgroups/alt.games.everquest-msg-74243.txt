I've never had any trouble running away if I have high endurance.  I
turn, hit autorun, and hit sprint.  The mob gets a couple swings in
while sprint kicks in, and then I get away.  Worked that way for me in
beta, and works that way for me now.  I've run into mobs that can kill
me with the one or two swings they get in while sprint is ramping up,
but if I'm just traveling, say, and a mob of low purple or lower jumps
me, I have no trouble getting away.

Finding a safe place after I get away to sit and get endurance back is
sometimes another matter... :-)
