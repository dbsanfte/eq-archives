What level are you?

I said the caps are are higher on the weapons.

From: http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=68

1 Hand Blunt       (level*5) + 5   240    252
2 Hand Blunt       (level*5) + 5   240    252
Hand To Hand    (level*5) + 5   225    252

Hand-to-hand caps at 225 sub-level 51. It
eventually catches up to the blunts at about level 56 I think.
