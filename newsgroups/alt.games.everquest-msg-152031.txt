I highly recommend the web site www.eqdiva.com for bard players.  There's
plenty of new bard player information there, and helpful people to answer questions.

The manual, for example, doesn't really even tell you how to twist songs.  I hear that
in the first version of EQ that twisting wasn't even possible, and all songs were
Area of Effect type, buffing or damaging both the group and the mob you are fighting (!)
That changed a long time ago and the class is very different now, though not at all realistic :)

But that's no matter; it's just a class with some interesting and unique abilities.  I have a
level 47 bard on The Nameless (not a PvP server).  I've heard that bards are one of
the most difficult classes to kill on PvP servers, primarily because of their running song, and
the fact that they can "cast" while moving.
