Personally I despise full screen mode.  Flowing visuals "under" the chat
window and the health bars of my party members are distracting, I can't
think why I would want that.  Further, if for some reason I do want to do
something based on the visuals, half the time what I want is -under- one
of the many windows I have up and running.

What I would pay dearly for would be the 10 visible hot key buttons
that full screen users get... yes, I have the same 10 button functionality,
but the bottom four aren't visible.  Instead, I get this useless picture
of my class icon... and for a beastlord, no icon at all.

Rumor has it they are going to do away with "normal" mode entirely,
and intended to do so with the release of Luclin, which is why
there is no class icon for beastlords.  I'm -so- glad they didn't, and
hope that they never get around to it.
