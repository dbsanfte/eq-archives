Yes, according to George W. last night I believe it is. And from what 
I'm hearing today we may be real close to that proof. Here is what one 
Taliban official said yesterday: Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef, the Taliban 
ambassador to Pakistan, said: "We want to tell the American children 
that Afghanistan feels your pain and we hope that the courts find 
justice." 

I just hope the children of Afghanistan don't feel too much pain as the 
500lb and 1000lb little bits o'justice start falling. Hopefully we'll do 
it right this time and send some people in on the ground and physically 
remove them... I'd personally like them caged in a zoo over here where 
we can buy rocks for a $1 a piece to throw at them until they are not 
quite dead.. revived and healed to the point where we can throw more 
rocks for years upon years. Gees.. some days it pays to be a Sadist I 
guess.
