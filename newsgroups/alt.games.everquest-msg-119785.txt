I don't play on that server but for a free magic 1hb weapon just do the
Tribunal quest starting in Halas.  You deliver a wanted poster to Qeynos
and return with the note to Halas. He gives you a Tribunal "necklace?"
that right clicks to summon a clerical "Hammer of Wrath", zero mana.

You can also do the Fang of the Wolf quest in Halas for a magic
piercing weapon. This requires sewing a gnoll fur blanket and handing
it in for the Fang. You should be able to buy all the patches of gnoll fur
you need from vendors. Combine 4 patches of gnoll fur to make a gnoll fur
patch.
combine 4 patched to make a patch quarter. then combine 4 of them to
make the blanket.  You need 64 pieces with no failures.
