Radeon's use standard DirectX rendering methods. It also has it's own 
version of tile-based rendering (if I'm not mistaken), but it also uses 
standard methods. Much easier to support than Kyro II cards.

Remember: ATI makes and sells their own chips, and therefore writes their 
own drivers. Hercules sells other company's chips, and their drivers are 
based off reference drivers written by the company who made the chip. If 
it's possible to write a driver upgrade to support EQ, Hercules is at the 
mercy of the chipset vendor.
