 Guilds resources? From the original message it sounds like just the GL
is powerleveling that person. If the GL is away that's hardly a huge
drain on resources. There should be officers to pick up the slack and
since the GL is still on anything requiring major attention could be
sent to him. I've heard of lots of reasons for leaving a guild but that
one is pretty weak.
