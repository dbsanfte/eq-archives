My friend has a human monk alt, ( I know, I know, lizards
make better monks.  Fine.  But thats not the dream, this
isn't a min/max character) and there are times when her
lack of night vision is annoying.  Everfrost tunnel.  Dreadlands
Tunnel.  Surefall tunnel.  Its not all that often, but its annoying.

So, what IR/UV items out there can we twink her out with,
or go in and camp with her, to take care of this problem?

We have the resources of a 59 druid, 59 cleric, and 59 monk,
or can go get it "honestly" as a 40 monk and 40 bard, or
spend up to a Kpp (more would just seem wasteful) on
a bazaar item.

Can't figure out how to search by specific effects like
this one, which I understand may not be listed at all
on some items?

Bergh, 59 cleric
Llyric, 40 bard
Morell Thule

(yes I know I can sing an IR song, and that my two
DS songs both also provide night vision... but that
doesn't help when shes' trying to cross one of those
tunnels on her own)
