After playing a beastlord solo for 43 levels now I have come to this
conclusion.  Our pets are dumb, stupid, dense.  Even when soloing I have
found that if a add hits the pet the pet will turn and attack the add,
leaving me hanging with my not so spectacular melee output.  Now this is not
always a bad situation.  For example while it is tenderizing the add, you
keep smacking the original pull and when the pull gets low enough the pet
will act just like a npc and agro the mob.  And all this time it is gaining
and holding the agro of the add.  Depending on the situation this now gives
you the option to wade into the add, or just sit back, relax, heal the pet
if necessary or just med, until the mob runs.
