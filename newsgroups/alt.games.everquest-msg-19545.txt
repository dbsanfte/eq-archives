As an int caster you need to put all your points into research, or at least
as many as it will allow. The more points you have in research the more
likely you will be able to make your research only spells. Unless of course,
you know a high lvl wizard who will research your spells for you.

Well as a Wizard I wont need a weaponskill.
What is specialization? Should I put points in that?

What about putting all my points into meditate?
