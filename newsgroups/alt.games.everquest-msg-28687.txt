I wish I could say I made all this junk up but this is actually part
of $cientology's secret teachings.  There is even a sample of it in L.
Ron Hubbard's own handwriting, as well as a very good summary (all
within Fair Use guidelines), at:

http://almond.srv.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/OTIII/

The Scientologists have made a habit of suing (or threatening to sue)
people who have put the OT3 story, as well as other higher level
documents and other materials, on web pages or posted it to
newsgroups, on the grounds of "copyright violation"; they've hassled
me a number of times about my web page and some of the stuff on it.
So I'm figuring this is really part of their teachings if they're
threatening to sue people for "copyright violation" by posting it.

Oh, and I probably should have warned you all before I posted before,
but according to L. Ron Hubbard, if you read the contents of OT3
before you have gotten the previous Scientology training/courses, you
will catch pneumonia and die!  I sincerely apologize and hope I
haven't caused an epidemic among all you EQ players by posting this
here!
