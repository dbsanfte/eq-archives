Hi,

After dying last night (twice), I have to complain about something:

The XP required to level in EQ is just a little too high.

It seems that the last 1/4 of get experience before a level is nothing
but killing the same mobs over-and-over and provides nearly no
enjoyment for me (boy, am I gonna get flamed on that one!)

I understand that EQ needs to keep people from just leveling non-stop,
but really, having to kill those final 15 mobs is something that I've
already done a thousand times and really am tired of doing.

I think that reducing the XP requirement for levels would not hurt the
game and would actually make it less tedious.

Of course, we got mobbed by 4 Sarnaks at the Fort last night (still
don't know how -- think we were trained) and I levelled-up as one
of the Sarnaks was killed and then died before we killed another.

Now, I have lost 2 blue bubs, which the level 50 people I'm sure will
be quick to poo-poo, but that represents another 30 minutes of my REAL
life (at least) just getting back to where I was.  And, it's another
30 minutes of killing those same, tedious mobs that I've already killed
a thousand times.  Gee, how exciting that's gonna be...

OK, I've gotten my opinion out there, and I'd like to hear other people's
calm, cool rebuttals, agreements, etc.  Flamers need not apply since I'll
just delete your message.

Mike
