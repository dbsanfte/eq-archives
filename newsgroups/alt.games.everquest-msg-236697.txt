From a 'God's' point of view wouldn't you say its rather arrogant of
you refuse to accept the miracle of your own existance as proof of his
creative act of will. Would such a God really feel inclined to lower
himself to your level and do tricks for your amusement to try and
prove it to you...

And even if God did manifest 'in person' and poked you in the eye with
a stick to get your attention would you finally accept it or just
decide to believe someone must have slipped some e into your beer
instead?

If one is going to choose not to beleive in God, then proof is really
not the issue. Because you can reject any amount of proof placed
before you, and you've already rejected existance itself... why would
a lesser miracle convince you?


Not that I'm saying your wrong, (I'm agnostic myself and like you I
have many issues with organized religions...but I digress)

The game is called "memory" and the present incarnation of the bible
is far more convoluted than that. The Vatican and other groups have
had to 'discern' prophets from madmen, translate from dead languages,
and selectively order and assemble the thing...  their judgement and
motives may not always be 100%.
