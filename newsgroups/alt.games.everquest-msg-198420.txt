It's not currently working with test server (unless there's a special 
version or something for test server?).  I basically went through alla's 
and found what the "real" items where called and built 'em by hand (I also 
had some help identifying 'em from past experience and from a few 
serverwide channels).  Pretty annoying since I usually just do the auto 
sync thing :P
