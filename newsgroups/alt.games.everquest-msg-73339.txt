Anyone else having this problem?

I can still play the game and I have another cursor (the game cursor) that I
can use, but there is a white cursor stuck in the middle of the screen for
the entire time I'm logged on....

It's rather irritating....

Just wondering if anyone else has encountered this and knows of a way to
clear it off there....
