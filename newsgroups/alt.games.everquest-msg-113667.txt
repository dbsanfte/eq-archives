From what I have read the games space travel and combat will be released as
a later expansion. I also read somewhere that only certain accounts will
have Jedi progression available, randomly given to accounts like 1 in every
200 or so. This would be consistent with the LORe on Star Wars... not
everyone is born with mediclurions (sp?) in their body. Sucks though as I
would buy the game as I would want to train as a Jedi or Sith.

Looks good though and I for one will certainly buy it to play it for a
while. My two years in advance EQ subscription will be running out about the
time they release it.
