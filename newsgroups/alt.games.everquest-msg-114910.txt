I know, but its a whole load of hassle to go through, with a lot of ifs and
buts, for it making a raid difference.

Some of my guild is still talking about twink Vox raids for rez sticks.. I
wouldn't mind one, but a guildie (who has 2) said the re-charge cost is
something insane, like 20k+

Im sure 99% of essence emeralds come from retired people who's account is
given to their guild, sacrificed down, then cancelled.
