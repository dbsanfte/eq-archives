In the latest patch they increased the damage output of grouped mobs. Now, i
find in the area I'm in (Najena, Antonica) and the level (18) that all the
groups want to do is bash the same type of mob endlessly, because that is
the min max method e.g they go from scarecrows (about lv 9-15) to stags,
because they are perceived as dropping the best loot. If you want to see
evidence of that, consider how many groups fight the assorted sea creatures.
In my time in antonica, i have yet to see anyone but myself. At least the
commonlands seemed to occasionally have a group fighting pirates.

Now, I've tried to enjoy that but after being in group after group where
there was no socialising because it got in the way of grinding, no
exploration because grinding means staying still or wandering little at
best, and no fund but the joy of watching an xp bar move, I decided that
soloing was the path for me, at least until i could find people interested
in something other than what they call an "xp group".

Then in the latest patch, they increased the damage output of grouped
monsters. Now, as a soloer I depend on quests because fighting mobs alone
doesn't give you much xp or gear, but the trouble is, the quests are often
for grouped mobs (eg timberclaws). Suddenly i find that I'm being hit harder
and losing more often. "Oh joy" I thought, "SOE has nerfed soloing ...
again....".

I played EQlive till 58 and noticed they often changed things to make things
harder for the soloer... making mobs immune to snare, unnamed mobs summoned,
etc and it was only recently that they admitted in EQlive that it was their
policy to discourage soloing.

So anyhow, that attitude seems to have moved over to EQ2. Once again, I'm
regretting the time/money investment I've made in a game where they change
the rules to diminish my enjoyment for no apparent reason but their loathing
of the ungrouped player.

Time to move on. I'm checking out WOW as soon as I can find a store nearby
that sells it, as the local EB pretty mcuh just sells xbox stuff now.
