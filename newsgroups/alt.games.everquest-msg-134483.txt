yes... finally got one of my 2 PCs to download the whole patch (the older
one, of course)... tried logging into AB and crashed straight out.


Random kicks to desktop seem to be a theme of this patch... which means the
patch/login server is getting hammered by people trying to get back in after
a crash, as WELL as those still trying to get the download :o(

Why they can't do a rolling update is beyond me.
