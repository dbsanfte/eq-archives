They are USELESS.  They are POINTLESS wastes of SPACE, oh yes they ARE.

Excuse me.  Maybe it's my genes, but I'm going to go a bit Innoruuk here,
for a moment.

WHY (and I'm sorry about all the upper-case, but I'm cross) are guards
absolutely all over you like a gods-damned RASH whenever you're trying to
hunt monsters and gain some experience, with their smug bloody smarmy
comments and general fighter-pilot, pompous arrogant asshole swagger (no
offence to any fighter pilots here); but the moment you get dropped on by
three giant spiders, a woodland lion AND the willowisp you were attacking in
the first place, is there NEVER a SINGLE guard to be seen?

I'll TELL you why.  It's because they're COWARDS.  They don't WANT to get
involved if there's big odds because they'd sooner just hang around and KS
you at every end and turn.  Bloody PLAYERS aren't allowed to kill-steal -
why the hell can guards get away with it?

Well, that's it.  I'm not strong yet and most of them are red to me, but I
SWEAR - as soon as I get a few more levels, Freeport will not know what hit
it.  I will go back into that town and I will brutally and painfully MURDER
every last smug-arse bastard guard who crosses my path; THEN I'll work my
way through every little nook, cranny and cubby-hole in the town until I
find the whimpering craven ones who just ducked out of the way when they saw
me coming - and I'll RIP their squealing HEADS off and shove them up their
backsides.  THEN I'll do the same thing in Neriak, you see if I don't.
Hell, I might just work my way across the continent and dismember the whole
damn bunch of them and feed the remains to the trolls (no offence to any
trolls here).

This is not a threat, you self-obsessed, smirking, preening, cretinous,
shiny-helmet-wearing quarter-wits - IT IS A PROMISE.
