Unless you have more money than sense, don't buy anything from vendors,
any more than you should sell things to them if there is any demand for them
from players.

A vendor will pay 1 silver for something from a player, then charge
1 pp for it if you want to buy it.

Players who are making things for skill increase frequently -will- sell
to vendors, even though its a ripoff, because its better than destroying
the stuff, at least you get -some- of your investment back, and you
don't have to stand around auctioning for hours.

But most any player making stuff would be happy to recieve fair
value for it instead of what the vendor will pay... take for example
that item we were talking about just a couple paragraphs back;
if you pay him a gold for it thats ten times what the vendor would
have paid, and yet a tenth what you would have had to pay that
vendor, if you could find it at all.

Raw silk is made only by player tailors, no vendor normally
carries it, although you might find some if you look long
enough, as people -do- sell it occaisionally.  Supply them
with the silk, which drops off of Spiders, and you might
get a better deal, but just buying it flat out should be workable
too.  Another option would be to learn tailoring yourself, getting
up to Raw Silk levels won't really be all that onerous, although
you'll probably spend more cash and time on it than you would
have just buying it outright.
