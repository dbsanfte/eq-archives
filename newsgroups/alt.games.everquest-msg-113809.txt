I think many of us had.  I learned something last night that I'm sure to
remember....

In almost every case you realize what you've done JUST as you clicked on the
last item on your corpse.  Well, fret no more!

Go linkdead (/q).  When you get back your corpse should be waiting on you.
I have no idea what the timer is on an empty PLAYER corpse, but on critter
corpses it's 30 seconds, so I'd recommend having your cleric ready to cast
when you get back.
