Lots of luck. This is the one thing I absolutely hate about EQ in it's
current state.

I lost a 10k item when they changed over to the new way of doing CS.  I
couldn't even send an email to GM contact because it was down for
"maintenence" for 3 days.

- I quit after this for quite awhile. But decided to try it again.

I recently lost another item after a rez, and I was able to get it back
after 4 days.  I petitioned every time I got on with any character, and
constantly checked /viewpetition to make sure it was still there, and
send a GM email.  It used to be when you started a petition it would
remain after you logged, but not any more.  - Just keep spamming about
it in game and on email.

If anything gets me to quit perminantly it will be really poor CS
combined with another game as engrossing.

On the other hand, last time I played AO and I had a problem where I
couldn't zone and I petitioned, I got a reply within 5 minutes and got
it fixed.
