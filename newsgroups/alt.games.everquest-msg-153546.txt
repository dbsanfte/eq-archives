I once read an abstract of a study which determined that
incompetent people are also usually pretty incompetent at
recognizing how incompetent they are.

In other words, incompetent people tend to vastly
overestimate their own competence.  Or in the immortal
words of Red Skelton, "little do you know how little you know".

When I read that I realized that it explains a *LOT*, not
just in the game, but IRL as well.

/em stops to do some Google searches...

Ah, here we go:

  "Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in
  Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated
  Self-Assessments"

And an amusing New York Times article about the study:
