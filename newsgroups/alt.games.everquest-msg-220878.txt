This is the key conceptual point that I hope Sony is smart enough to
implement: don't make the tank classes functionally the same, make it a
choice to think about.

Makes sense in the above spirit, though I don't like this difference being
just due to an AA, it should apply across the board to some degree. The AA
levels aren't actually the whole game, yet, and I'd hate to see them
continue to become so.

This would be fine too, in the same spirit.

Here's another thought: what if warriors had such high inherent resistances
that they were practically immune to the attacks of casting mobs? The
resistance being scaled to the warrior's level of course -- a lvl30 warrior
shouldn't be able to easily absorb the nukes of a lvl50 mob. But the idea is
that a warrior, much moreso than paladins or SK's or the DPS classes, could
shrug off the blasts and roots and whatnot of casting mobs appropriate to
his level. So now your ideal choice of tank will be heavily influenced by
what sort of mobs you will be facing. And this gives the warriors a side
benefit, much less need to find and wear resist gear.

I guess this change would have only modest impact on the high-end raiding
game, where the raid group's tanks are buffed up to high resistances anyway,
everybody dons their high end resist gear along for the purpose, etc. But at
levels 1 through maybe 55ish, warriors would be distinctly better
magic-attack-sponges than other tanks, a tradeoff for the others' superior
aggro control.
