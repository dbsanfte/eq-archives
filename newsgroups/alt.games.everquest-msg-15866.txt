Usually, I think you're way too full of vitriol.  But that was 
frighteningly well put. :)

A favor you didn't want is not a favor.  Note that that is distinct from 
getting something you didn't know you wanted until you got it.  Note also, 
that that doesn't apply here, since the original poster _still_ didn't 
want it, after they got it.

Rich, remind me to come ofer to your place and 'straighten up' a little.  
The way your posessions are organized makes no sense to me, and half of it 
should clearly be thrown out, who'd want to keep that?  

You're not losing anything of value to me, and everything will end up in a 
place that makes much more sense to me.  Clearly, I will have done you a 
favor.  You may thank me in advance.
