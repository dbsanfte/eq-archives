Grouped in DL late one night, myself 32th Druid and 34 level Enchanter
partner. Taking a small med break after a heavy pull. Next thing I know the
enchanter is running around in circles, jumping, ducking, and doing all
sorts of crazy stuff. I send him group tells asking what's the heck is up.
Anyway he gets arggoed by a Sarnak Knight and it is a very sick fear kitting
thing going down, so I cast succor and take us to EK. About 15 min later
this enchanter stops moving and I get a tell. Dude, were are we? I tell him
EK. What the hell happened? I ask. "I fell asleep on my key board. Anything
bad happen?"


Cloudanser, 40th Druid, Quellious.
