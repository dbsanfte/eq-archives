Hehe, had to do something like it the other day, was playing buffing station
in IllOmen mill while buying Sabertooth pelts, and a guy first wanna buy my
stuff, then tell me he dont have money for the KD (go for 4-5K on Veshaan),
the ask me to port to GFay to see what his bard have.
Since i dont have a bard, and are not especially interested in trading 1 low
weight item for 10 high weight items i then have to sell, i tell him he can
get money, and tell me then. Then he say he can max get 500pp in money from
all his chars.
At that point im really puzzled to how he would them pay me for a 5K item.
Then he start insulting me for not wanting to trade with him, then start
asking for buffs.
Am of course getting rather tired of him at this point, so refuce to give him
buffs. Then he tried to say that it was his little brother at the keyboard.
So now i do not wanna waste time buffing him, but helped him when he got in
trouble at the Mill.
The next day he tried to trade with me in NFP with another char, again try to
give me 10 items worth 2K and 1K for the KDs. When i again tell him im not
interested he start insulting me again.

So next time i see him in trouble at Mill im just gonna sit there and laugh my
ass of when he die.
