Because there is nothing wrong with his connection even after he
crashes, he is simply locking up. The cable modem activity proves
that. If it was a connection issue either 1. you wouldn't see the
server trying to talk to you (because the packets are being lost), or
2. you would see your modem frantically trying to send packets back.

Neither is the case. The computer no longer knows to send packets at
all, because EQ is *toast*.

His problem is most likely something to do with graphics and hardware,
not connection, IMO, especially if he is getting non fatal pauses
every few minutes.

The other guy did what you said and had no luck, btw.

CONGRESSMAN:  "These reports undoubtedly prove that your product makes
    people die. You are selling things which make people die, but not
    only do they just die, they also become addicted to your product
    for tens of years before they die, thereby supplying you with
    obscene amounts of money in exchange for letting them die."
TOBACCO REPRESENTATIVE: "Yeah, so?"
CONGRESSMAN: "Only us governmental officials are legally able to kill
    people and take their money."
