Actually if you read closer, you received a "checklist" flag.

Checklist flags were something they put in many moons ago, to deal with
messed up/lost flags, when doing flag mobs out of order.

It will only show up when a) you have killed all previous flag mobs, and b)
you have followed all hails and associated chats, to "register" those kills
