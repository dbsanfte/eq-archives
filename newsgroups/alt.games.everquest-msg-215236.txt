How? I think "hack" is used too loosely. Without any of the other ways
you mentioned, the only thing left is someone guessing the account
login and password. Unless his were very common words, it would be
pretty impossible.

"hack" suggests someone getting on his computer somehow and doing
something to get his login and password, or getting on SOE's
computers.
