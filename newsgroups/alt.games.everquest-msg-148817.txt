Thanks for confirming what many have suspected. This is insane but
sadly predictable, have seen more than one company try to kill the
goose that lays golden eggs to promote some new product that just
never pans out. It aint pretty to watch folks.

DT man you are gonna defend this crap till when? EQ collapses? 
They are progressively ending CS heh what have they got to do for you
to stop defending these morons? Its getting worse and its already piss
poor.

Microsoft gives you what they agree to give you in the box with your
software or didnt you read that? SOE gives you less every damn month
and generally no clear definition of any CS.

Ok so what can we do besides piss an moan, seriously?
LoL I dunno but in no way am I gonna get any deeper into a VI game
than I already am. Tried walking away from EQ but to be honest have
put too much into it and have too many people I like there. Leveling
my last char now to 60, wont be another one for sure. Sooo...

1. Not under any circumstances buying PoP, it can sit on the shelves
and freakin rot. Least till something changes for the better.

2. No way no how getting involved in SWG although man was really
wanting to try it, big SW fan. But just dont trust VI enough to let em
reel me in again )

3. Wait and see what happens and enjoy a truly great game while
avoiding ANY situation that might involve needing in game CS. LoL now
thats not gonna be easy. Pretty much kiss PNP goodbye, can hear the
brats now;
Go ahead petition LoL hasnt been a GM on in weeks.
So what if I scammed you lol they aint gonna do nuthin.
 
Maybe they will change all the servers to PvP hehe. 
Now theres an idea ....

/em sighs
