    You aren't alone. Start a level 1 character on your server if you have a
character slot available, do alt-v, look at your statistics. You should see
what place you are in per theme. That tells you how many characters have at
least one win in that theme. The numbers are very interesting, at least on
my server. For every 1 person that has won at least once in Guk on my
server, 2 have won in Tak or Rujark or Miragul's, and 4 have won in
Mistmoore.
