One of my complaints since the servers "up" patch has been that I"m
unable to tell the difference between servers up and servers that have
only testers online... although there is a "locked" setting it is used
infrequently at best.

While clicking around today after seeing UP on the main EQ board but
being unable to log in due to "congestion" I found
http://everquest.station.sony.com/netstat/index.jsp
which still doesn't give anything but "UP" for servers, but which has,
in the upper right hand corner, an overall count of players online.
over 9000, which can't just be testers can it?
