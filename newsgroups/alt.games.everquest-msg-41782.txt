6 is fair.

220 Channeling may be a bit lower than the 255 Channeling that
pure casters get, but it's hardly "cruddy" either.   I routinely
channel through major hits, I've really not had significant
problems casting during battle.

And again, the handy Flash of Light spell can be used (via
its short cast time) to blind a mob, even one that's machine-gunning
me, followed by stepping back slightly, then Rooting it as it 
begins to run in circles.

I've not had any significant problems Rooting a mob I
want Rooted, even while being pounded on by more than one
at the same time.

Shield of Words:  AC+32
Resolution:       AC+15
                  HP+250
Divine Strength:  HP+200
Symbol of Naltron: HP+525

They all stack, so that's a total of AC+47, HP+975,
all buffs last close to an hour.

Plus, Paladins have buffs that add MR+40, DR+40,
PR+25.

Nothing to sneeze at.

No, that sounds good.

It's possible that this may peter out at higher levels, where the
blues become harder and harder.  But around 50, a Paladin is the
easiest tank class to solo, in my experience.
