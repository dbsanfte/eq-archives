On the crawl to a mob like XTC, HP, AL, pretty much all casters/healers are
useless.. theres no sitting and medding, no pulling mobs and making sure
people are ready.. you just walk into a room of mobs, the main warrs will
(generally) grab agro fast.. and only their clerics need to be healing.

Everybody else can just nuke or auto follow, for what it matters...

Btw, "clerics usually have wand of casual blessings, (spells to others).." -
my guild had no wands period.  I got bored of that mob and his trillion
hp/tick regen, especially his DA weapon, I stopped checking when he was up.
We too gave shamans/druids GRC first.. but clerics got copies too, and other
than being in the cheal chain, I don't think they have any excuse to not be
curing.

You still don't need more than 1 or 2 clerics all the way to the named mobs,
and that includes rushing entire rooms of mobs along the way (well, maybe
not AL's guards heh.. but XTC and HP for sure)

Wow 12 rogues!!!!  Anyway, sure the rogues get the traps.. but somebody
always manages to hit the raid with a trap (at least once, usually more..)
every time i pull from hp/xtc area, theres always a trap that hits me too..
every time.  Rogues are always adamant the traps were all down too (diff
rogues, not the same one being lazy)

But again - omg 12 rogues!  Avg for us was more like 2/raid!
