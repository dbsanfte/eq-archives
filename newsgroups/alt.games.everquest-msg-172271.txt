I enjoy the feeling of community in Asherons Call 2 and I was hoping the
same applies in Everquest.  You often get strangers offering you
weapons/armour/potions etc in AC2.  Although you do get the odd miserable
git :o)

As I mentioned the AC2 European server is up down up down, you can never
tell if it's going to be up or down.  However, they do post when the next
patch is going to be installed on their web site.  The server goes down
again during patch day.  I could handle the servers being down during patch
installation but it's all the other times that have annoyed me.

To be honest I'm not to keen on PvP.  I prefer the questing and monster
bashing myself.

I am a bit of a loaner when it comes to questing and monster bashing though.
