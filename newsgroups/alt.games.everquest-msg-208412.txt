In simple terms, someone asks "What's 2+2"
I respond "That's simple, 4"

You follow up with a couple of posts questioning my answer. You drift to
"What about 2X2? Your answer doesn't tell him how to add 3+3."

It isn't a conditionally correct answer. It is responsive and direct to the
question asked and the topic at hand. Had the poster asked "What is the role
of a druid in a group?"  then your post about groups may have been relevant.
As it is, 4 is still the right answer to his question.
