Yes, but if they are self buffed its hardly a concern to the
cleric... cause if the cleric isn't going to buff up the mage
who's Mod Mad, he's sure not going to waste mana
healing him either.  Its Mod2 that buys a mage his ticket,
at last, to the wonderful world of the Symbol, and of the
Complete Heal.  If he works at it a bit, his HP total can
easily get over 3000, or =ten= charges of mod rod.
Thats a lot of mana produced even after you subtract the
400 mana cost for the CHeal and the cost of making the
rods themselves.  Likewise, I'll pick up mods off the floor
and then CHeal myself for a hefty net gain in mana.

Cleric and Mod2 mage is a powerful combination...
