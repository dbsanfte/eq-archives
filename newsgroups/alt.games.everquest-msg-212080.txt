Taunting at low level, when you can still gain skill level at taunt does have
an effect, right?  I'm guessing that's why the Ranger Guides tell you to
practice *taunt* every chance you get - even when soloing.  To get your skill
level up?
I'm always *the* tank when I play with my wizard friend.  In wide open areas I
snare, he nukes, then he runs away while I beat on the nasty critter from
behind since he gets agro because he does more damage.  (I only *taunt* in
those situations if he gets in trouble).
Playing a low level ranger is quite different than playing a high level
ranger.....
