Oh, well perhaps you should pull your  head out of yer ass and learn how to
be good at sarcasm, instead of being the best boi - whore on the waterfront,
'jizz'. Do YOU want a big stwong man to take you away fwom it aw? How
thweet. Too bad you can't have a man like the one I have. Big, strong,
gorgeous, and unlike, you , he has a nice pair of balls, too. Now put on
your prettiest lil dress and run on to work, M'K? Oh, and do something about
those shoes! Nothing more pathetic than a boi - whore who can't
accessorize......
