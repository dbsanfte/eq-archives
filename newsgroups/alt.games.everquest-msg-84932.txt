A thought occurs to me... what happens if a bunch of Euro and/or
Asian/Aussie players sign up... will THEY get their moneys worth?

And does Verant realise what level of character they're getting on this new
service? (bear in mind Antonious Bayle has already had 2 seperate guilds
solo (not joint-raid) AoW successfully?

Suddenly I see Legends as being a LOT of work for VI... a LARGE number of
VERY well organised and experienced players who are going to, quite rightly,
expect 24/7 service ESPECIALLY during holidays.

I wonder how long it will take for this new service to crash and burn under
the weight of it's own promises?
