In the long run, you are probably correct.

My special case was one where we were both the same level.  Once I ding 
a level, I'm getting less exp per kill on the same mob, due to the way 
exp calculations are worked.  This means that eventually my buddy 
catches up to me... or would, except that after a while he dings too. 
Then, for some time, we're both the same level killing the same mobs, 
and he's again moving a little slower than I am.

It wasn't a vast difference, but it was there.  The same is true of the 
stat differences, of the relatively tiny regen, the not getting stunned 
thing... none of them are massive game breaking differences, but they 
are there.

Why not, for example, give gnomes the same "don't get stunned from the 
front" bonus that ogres get?  I'll tell you why; because it makes the 
game less interesting, if everyone is the same.
