I think the concepts in EQ that are ripped off from AD&D will remain
for a long long time. Since Gygax/AD&D ripped off all his ideas from
Tolkien and Tolkien "borrowed" heavily from mythology and folklore.
Also, before EQ there were many CRPGs and MUDs that were around
a long time that used the D&D fantasy concepts.

I think the mechanics will develop over time like the addition of a 'mana'
bar for real time computer games. However, the fantasy and heroic aspect
of role playing games will remain for a long time. Dragons, elves, dwarves
etc are familiar to us all by now. A new game that starts out with new ideas
monsters and stat system will take a long time to grow because most people
will adopt a new game that has familiar concepts before one that is
unfamiliar.
