Hey, I never said it was meaningful. :-) Just that it's not a free market.
Don't blame me for the definition. This sort of useless ideal definition
is one reason I've steered clear of classical economics since I finished
my degree.

But KEI doesn't even come close thanks to the "camps" and other issues.
Usually economists will call something a free market if it sorta comes
close to the requirements.

Depends on your definition of "harmful". It appears that the courts believe
that name calling and similar intangible damage counts as harmful. I agree
with the courts on this, although I think many of the court awards are
ludicrous.

Given that it *is* a game, with virtual "cash", damage to your virtual
"reputation" is at least as meaningful. It would certainly make the game
less fun, thin skin or no.

I have. I also have a chanter friend who told me about the "camps" system
(long before I saw the public squabble).

It may be a server thing I supppose. I've never seen more than three
chanters offering KEI in nexus: bazaar steps, PoK book and Nexus centre.
Add one at the Nexus stone in PoK and that's four camps. I don't know if
those are what the chanters actually *use* but I haven't seen a chanter
selling KEI in anything but those locations for a long time.

I've seen it happen once. I don't hang around in the Nexus much, so I
assume it has happened on other occasions. I suppose it *may* have been an
isolated incident.

As I don't play a chanter I've only seen this happen second hand, not
had it happen to me personally. My understanding is that it's a system
being used by the enchanter community; there are many "traditions" on
the server that are enforced by the community rather than by Sony. For
example, a chanter looking for a replacement may "overlook" somebody
who had "stolen" a KEI camp. A chanter looking for a new guild may have
their application vetoed by a chanter who had seen this happen. The
chanter who I saw trying to "break" the camp was already in one of the
top guilds on Cazic Thule, so such issues were probably of less concern
to him.

The "enforcement" of the KEI camps is opaque to me; I suspect it's simply
a case of the enchanters agreeing to limit the number of camps to keep the
flow of people up, since KEI-for-donations is pretty boring I imagine.
Which would make the market either an oligopoly or a collusion, neither
of which approach free market status. Note that a collusion does not
always have to be an explicit agreement.

Aside from that, even if you disagree on the barriers to entry - and I
can see how you might - pricing information is also poorly disseminated,
which would also disqualify it. "For donations" conveys no pricing
information worth mentioning.

I should probably just drop the debate; it's something very few people
actually care about, including myself, but the pedant in me won't let
go. :-)
