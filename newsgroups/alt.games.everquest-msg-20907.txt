Trouble is, ES arms have the level 34 DOT.  My best friend has a pair and
when I borrow her character it comes in handy for when you're OOM or when
the critter has only a few hundred hp left, snared, and running (trying to).
But for actual combat unless you're quad kiting or something (hey, free
damage is free damage) I wouldn't consider using it, myself.

Comes in great while PLing a twink though.
