Listen, dipshit, the point was the things that were put in to appease
casuals were, in many cases, things that did not improve the game. At
no point did I say they were BAD for raiders. Your inability to tell
the difference between what is bad for me and what is bad for all
raiders is your whole problem.

There was, in fact, not a single reference to raiders in the post you
replied to!

And you had the gall to call ME a liar? It's just more of your aping
your betters like you were before, isn't it?

You're just thrashing around wildly now. We'll see how pathetic your
argument gets from this point on as you've obviously lost any touch
with reality.

More thrashing. You replied to one post, then claimed you replied to
another, lost the context in the meantime, and are now claiming you
challenged points THAT NO ONE EVER RAISED by screwing up your replies
to my points of casuals being catered to, claiming (with no evidence)
I was arguing it was bad for raiders.

Are you really so stupid you don't see it?

You're so fucked up even after being set correctly you immediately
veer off the road again. Once again - its not a concession IF IT WAS
NEVER MY POINT IN THE FIRST PLACE YOU DUMBASS.

Even the quotes above - one of which you lied about being in the post
you replied to - are quite clear that I am referring to my own opinion
of the state of the game, not a general raiding point of view.

Clear now? Or going to go chase some more cows?

Evidence so far suggests otherwise, since you are trying (with no
success whatsoever) to argue AGAINST points I, in some cases, dislike.
Though we should remember you are still showing an inability to figure
out the difference between what I dislike, and what was bad for
raiders; this probably explains your continuing idiocy.


> I log on to play a game, not
>to perform repetetive acts which make no sense.

That is in regards only to fixing factions, and not even all of them.
It is certainly not the end all be all of what faction meant to the
game.. not that you'd have any experence with that, obviously being
someone brought up in the time since faction became irrelevent.


>Why an enemy race would forgive you for killing a single guard for a few

>also unclear. The system was STUPID.

The system was not perfect. I even agree with the first statement; if
I had made the faction system faction adjustments for killing things
would be permanent, not raisable.

But the system created a means of showing which "sides" in the world
the PC was on. Look at the key word: world. EQ has moved away from
being a world in favor of arcadeness. But it was important and good at
one time. Being an ogre meant you couldn't be stunned from the front,
but a drawback was only being able to bank in a few select places.
Faction kept druids and rangers from hunting their goddess's creatures
in PoG. It made guilds pick sides of the war between Kael and
Skyshrine. It did a lot of great things.

But you, being one of those casual powergamers, doesn't see any of
that - all you see is "its boring to make faction go better, therefore
its bad". 


> It's good that they created
>workarounds. You can still turn in your muffins & batwings tho, so this
>change didnt hinder you at all. Why the hell are you whining?

You obviously wouldn't understand even if I told you. The scales
between world vs arcade tipped too far.

I meant no one was forcing you before then either.

Do you? You're unwittingly making the very point I am emphasizing.

It's very amusing when your opponent is so confused and clueless he
makes points FOR you! Please make sure you continue this practice.

Please show where I said the bazaar was built only for casuals, and
that it ruined the game, or concede that you are once again lying.

Since I already know you can't (but won't admit to lying anyways), let
me re-emphasize: bazaar was good in its way for BOTH casuals and
raiders, and I still don't like its effect on the game, though I would
not go so far as to say it ruined it (despite your lies).

You wouldn't know a clue if it bit you in the ass, and this post is

And you still haven't admitted that you screwed up what I was talking
about!

Since I never claimed either of the above, this is just more of Kris
thrashing around.

How come you are so stupid, Kris? Repeated attempts to show you that I
never claimed it "ruined" the game, and repeated attempts to show you
I never claimed it was "only" for casuals are being met with stoney
idiocy.

Shape up or shut the fuck up. Your stupidity is getting annoying.

Time for you to learn the difference between imply and infer.

And once again you have failed to show where I said things done for
casuals ruined the game. When are you going to stop screwing up, Kris?

It would be nice, but I'd settle for them just admitting what has been
done for them.

Because they want everything for no effort.

Everyone, eh? Done a poll, have you? All changes are positive for
everyone? Everyone loves everything?

I'll be waiting for your evidence on that, or in the absense, your
admission that you are talking out of your ass.

You said 'the post you replied to'. Now you've backtracked to "in this
thread".

You know the difference between "post" and "thread", right Kris? You
are sufficiently intelligent enough to grasp that, correct?

Are you also intelligent enough to understand the context can be
different in different posts in the same thread? Understand how that
could happen, neanderthal?

Have you yet admitted you messed up on what I was talking about or are
you planning to continue arguing you know what I meant better than I
do?

1kpp says you've invested too much self worth into this argument to
back down now even when you know you can't find the proof I've asked
for.

Silly Kris. I said no such thing. The raiders are doing something that
takes more risk, effort, time, responsibility, skill (despite 42's
claims), and investment. The reward should therefore be better.

I bet you'd just love for me to stop obliterating your stupidity. It
won't happen.

Now, Kris, get on to finding where I said "changes to help casuals
ruined the game" and "these changes were only to help casuals not
raiders". You've claimed both. You've claimed both repeated times.
Failure to provide direct evidence of me saying exactly that will be
considered an admission you fucked up and are lying to cover it up.

The two quotes you have provided so far did not say that.

I will be waiting.
