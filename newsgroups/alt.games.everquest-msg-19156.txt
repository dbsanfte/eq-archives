Depends how much money you have saved up.  If _nothing_ else, go to Erudin,
find Ms. Orefinder, buy some sharpening stones, and turn those rusty weapons
into tarnished ones.

Better yet, replace that rusty mace with a cracked staff....a much better
weapon.  Or, even better, if you can afford the 5 plat, go to Ye Magik shop
in Halas, and buy the regular 1hblunt staff there.   If you have 10-15pp to
spend, auction that you want to buy a fine steel or velious spear.

There is a quest for your level for a Gavel of Justice...shaman 1hb.
However, I found it to be excruciatingly long and tedious....spent a very
long time camping for the quest item, and never did get it.
