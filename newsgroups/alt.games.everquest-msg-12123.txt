Dont' worry about it.  If you've got yourself a steady, reliable
source of silks, just skip directly from silk swatches to raw silk
armor, to cured silk armor.  What you'll loose in failures you'll make
up for in not having to scrounge around for hides.  And Brewing is a
hell of a lot easier to skill up for the Heady Kiolas than
Blacksmithing will ever be.
