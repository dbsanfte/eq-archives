I haven't met anyone online to group with.  It seems they are way to high (
level wise) or too low.  I have a 24th lvl Druid that I'd like to grow into a
30th lvl and I have a 15 lvl bard wanting to be 20.  Jeesh it would be nice if
there was a message board for people wanting to group and roleplay at specific
times.  Wouldn't it be great to have a Friday night or Sataurday all day D&D
like play session?
