Nnnno, I don't think it'd be appreciated. *g* Actually, it's more of a 
"mock Orlando Bloom's hideous taste in clothing" (just go look at almost 
any outfit he's wearing during awards ceremonies or the like on an 
orlando bloom fansite) fanfic with large doses of "this was written for 
a friend who is obsessed with papal sex" fanfic.  It's weird, and silly, 
and basically, just like anything else I've ever written.  Completely 
insane to anybody except the 3 people I wrote it for/with.

> Easier to remember is www.verysecretdiaries.com.

lol! I forgot they had that. I just looked up the phrase "Sam will kill 
him" on google >;)  Then I reread them all after I posted that.  Ahhhh 
love love love that girl.
