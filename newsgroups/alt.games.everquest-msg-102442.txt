As mentioned, I'm buying some tranquilizers and valium and preparing to
actually start playing my wizard again. (*grimace*) When I was first
trying to level him a year or more ago, I really had no clue how to play
this game, was permanently impoverished, and my equipment was total
crap. So I'm hoping that I might fare a bit better now and find the
wizard experience at least slightly less frustrating. But when I dusted
him off to look at his gear I had to laugh to keep from crying. *grin*.

So now I've dropped what items I could scrounge up off my necro, and in
the bank on him, along with some hand-me-downs from guildies to start
outfitting him better to enhance his chances in the world. The biggest
upgrade is that, by tonight, he should have his j-boots. (Got the AC
ring yesterday.) However, many slots are still empty or pathetic. I'm
checking around on my own, and I'm willing to shop within reason (a few
K PP maybe) and more than willing to camp some stuff to finish the
upgrades before I start playing him again, and I'd like any pointers
towards good gear to improve his stats.

NOTE: I've never been clear on the whole "INT vs. MANA" debate, and what
level it really shifts, so if anyone can steer me in the right direction
on that question I'd be grateful. As you will see below, some of the
items I have are INT oriented, while some just give some nice mana
boosts. He's a level 24 erudite wizard, and currently his INT with this
gear is up to 174. I wanted to shoot for 200 (which should be easy with
an Erudite) but is that of more use at level 24 or should I be searching
for more +Mana items? Anyway, here's what I've got, remembering that
some of these have other stats, but I'm just focusing on INT and Mana
here:

Head: Savant's Cap +3 INT
Face: Raw silk. (bleah)
Shoulders: Raw silk. (bleah)
Neck: Loam Encrusted Choker +10 Mana
Ear: Shadowbone Earring +2 INT
Ear: Empty (bleah)
Chest: Oracle Robe +5 INT, +25 Mana
Back: Cloak of Ry'Gorr Oracles +2 INT, +10 Mana
Arms: Hollowed Bone Bracers +15 Mana
Wrist: PBB +3 INT
Wrist: Rotbone Bracelet +35 Mana
Finger: Rose Plat Engagement Ring +4 INT
Finger: Ring of Frost +3 INT, +10 Mana
Hands: Dusty Bloodstained Gloves +25 Mana
Waist: Raw Silk (bleah)
Legs: Raw silk (bleah)
Feet: Loam Encrusted Lined Shoes +15 Mana

Primary: Stein of Moggok +10 INT
Secondary: Skull of Jhen Tra +20 Mana
Range: Nothing (bleah)

HP: 372
AC: 266
ATK: 111
(Engrained warrior traits look at stats and screams, faints dead away)

STR- 69
STA- 75
AGI- 70
DEX- 83
WIS- 96
INT- 174
CHA- 81

Resist Poison: 27
Magic: 45
Disease: 35
Heat: 25
Cold: 40

We're thinking of camping the Ooowump guy in Tim Deep for a pair of Bat
Skull earrings. (+5 INT each). Also, my guild leader has an alt with
jewelcraft at about 200, so I can get any player made stuff at cost if
that's the best route for any of these slots to upgrade.

Remember, this character is many levels away from raiding and will be
mostly either soling, doing a dynamic duo with my wife's necro (I think
that combination has promise. *grin*) or pick up groups.

Any suggestions? Thanks in advance, as always.

Jakugg, 55 Troll Myrmidon
and once again, Jakiss, 24 Erudite Wizzie
