    I'm a Shadowknight man, you can take that one-handed crap and give it to
the poor!

    Velium Gemmed Great Sword 34/28(+35)
    Goldenrod 40/32(+37) + spirit leech

    Actually shit you're right, those two are so close it's not funny - only
the proc sets Goldenrod apart from the 28k bazaar-scum weapon, and the VGGS
has two slots that can take a lifetap DD proc aug...

    Oh well I'd already thought it was too close to bother going for luclin
weapons anymore, now I've got the calculator out it actually looks like
luclin weaps are a minor downgrade... sheesh
