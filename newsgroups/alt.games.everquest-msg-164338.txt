Since Davids post doesnt show up on Google groups I gotta respond in
this one.

Your argument assumes all white males are rich. What about O.J.
Simpson? Do you think some poor white trash could slit the throats of
2 people and buy a top notch team of attourneys who get him off scot
free? Well maybe not scot free....he does have to spend the remainder
of his days hitting up every golf course in the country in search of
"the REAL killers". There ARE a lot of good 'ol boy networks in the
country and it makes me sick. You really do end up with rich white
guys who are incompetent at their job who dont deserve to be there.
But it doesnt have to do with race but friends, family and so forth.
By the way...is the surname Navarro of hispanic origin? I (as a white
person) got my big break into my industry after 10 years of work by a
job offer from a hispanic owned company. The owner was in fact a
retired Lt. Colonel in the Marine Corps. He was the most decorated
hispanic soldier in vietnam. His nephew, who was my boss, recieved his
masters in engineering (whereas i dont have a single degree). Since it
was a small company who did a lot of contract support for the air
force and such it qualified for affirmative action grants and
programs. They laughed at the thought. They were the best at what they
did and didnt need the government helping them out. They were
naturally best because of their hard work and effort.
