We shall see. I'm skeptical that Sony would really would actually 
require a dx9 hardware compliant card at this stage of EQ's life.

Except that it runs fine today. And according to you it shouldn't be 
running at all. DX9 is required now. And this is not a DX9 card by any 
remote stretch. Even if what you said was true it clearly is not the 
case that you need a DX9 hardware compliant card to run the game 
today... and that is the only day the OP is interested in right now.

Myself, I'll wait until gf1s and 2s actually stop working before I tell 
people that their gf4 is too old.

HL2 is vapour at the moment too. Its far too early to make a buying 
decision based on HL2 at this point. The article you quoted is the 
better part of a year old -- 11th Sep 2003... TomsHardware has a 
similiar article, along with a followup on the 12th of Sep 2003. But 
whats the *current* word? Eight-plus months is forever in computer 
hardware and drivers.

I'll take that good luck... and we'll see. IF i need to buy new cards i 
will... I'm not really expecting to though. Although... to be fair... by 
Christmas this year I'd likely upgrade anyways... at least my primary.

I doubt it. A year from now we'll have DirectX 9.1 to worry about and 
the whole generation of cards from both manufacturers vapour and real 
will be obsolete. And EQ will still be there.

I do agree that it was a bad idea to go DX9 at this stage with EQ.
