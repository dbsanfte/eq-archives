I've bow kited up to evergreens (which were blue to me at lvl 27 and 28)
and they are soloable with care and judicious use of harmony.

THe little ones were nice blues to pick off at about the level you quiote
and they gave plat of reasonable level though not the items. THe midrange
giants I wanst on Kunark for a time that they were sensible blues so Im
not 100% sure how youd fare.
