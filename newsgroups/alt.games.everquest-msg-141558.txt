Well outside of all the "you are horrible for selling characters and
its against the eula!", arbitrary posts:

I'm afraid it will be cheap. Your account is possibly worth about what
Kunark/velious/Luclin is worth, if it includes all of them. If it
doesn't it is worth even less. A 55 mage and 55 beastlord just don't
cut it.

For comparison an account might get a 200 dollar bid if it had a lot
of single items on the character which were tradeable and themselves
are sold for a lot, like say a lodizal shield. A rare epic level 60
character, with important spells might go for a hundred or so also,
like a 60 mage with epic and COH.

Your three year time investment is worth less than if you worked two
shifts at your local burger king this weekend. Welcome to reality.
