Let's say there are 40 players in the zone, and ten of them are
anonymous, three of whom are shadowknights. There are also five non-anon
players who are marked as shadowknights. If you do a /w shadownights,
you'll count five of them, not eight. This is the original problem we're
trying to solve in this thread. How to get a total count of the number
of SK's in the zone, including the ones who are anon. Preferably with
level ranges.
