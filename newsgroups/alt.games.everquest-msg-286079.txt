I've finally started getting my level 55 auras (except for my poor SK,
who doesn't get one, /pout), and have a couple questions about them.

First, how long do the things last?  I've looked up several of the auras
and the associated "Aura of X Effect" spells and can't find anything to
say how long the aura-caster carries the effect around before it fades.
(Other party members seem to lose the effect within a tick or less after
moving out of range of the aura-caster.  I'm not sure how much the ranges
vary; druid and cleric auras seem to be slightly different radii.)

In other words, if a cleric casts Aura of the Zealot, how long will the
aura follow the cleric around?  (I'm frankly boggled that this information
isn't posted already in Allakhazam or whatever.)

Second, what determines whether the aura effect is visible?  I was
two-boxing and one box could see the effects of both auras: little
floating shields from the cleric's aura and little floating spots for
the druid's aura.  The other box didn't see either of those effects,
even after I fiddled with the various spell/env/player display options.
Is there some other setting I should be looking for?
