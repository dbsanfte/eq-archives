it is a pain to have downtime for patches I agree, but they have to do them
sometime and as it's a worldwide game they're always gonna impact on
someone's ideal game time. I'm not sure if they just don't test the patches
properly, don't read the bug reports from the test server or the bugs don't
get reported/notice on test because the population is so small in
comparison. It could also be, I suppose, that the live and test servers
aren't exactly the same. I can't believe that no-one reported the bug with
Monster Summoning, for example, that created a giant version of a mob when
they allowed pet zoning.

The comparison doesn't work with the ATM machines ... they only need to be
updated if they're going to be handling new currency (how often does that
happen?) .. if EQ was updated with the same regularity we'd still all be in
the old world at level 50 with no AAs, no expansions and hassling druids and
wizards for a port or running to catch the boat.
