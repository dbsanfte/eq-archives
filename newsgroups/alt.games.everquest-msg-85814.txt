Doubtful.  The developers -- where they've chosen to -- have made sure
that you can't MQ.  Some quests -- the first two coldain shawls, for
instance, don't even involve NO DROP items.   You can't MQ the whole
shawl series, though.   Lots of quests involve putting NO DROP items
in NO DROP containers, for instance.  You can't MQ those.

Instead of banning it, it's a trivial fix.  All they have to do is make the
GIVE button act like COMBINE button used to act.   Don't have all
the items or the proper amount?  Tough luck.  The fact that they
haven't "nerfed" it means they accept it.

Above all, EQ is a social game.  Sure, you can level to 60 in any class
without ever grouping.  But the game is designed to be social and
make you involve yourself with other people.  Allowing people to MQ
is just part of that.   And with people, you take the good and the bad.
You get the mage who's never found Quillmane getting the cloak MQ
from a friend who did.   And you get the idiots rolling on epic drops
they can't use against someone in the class who can use it.
