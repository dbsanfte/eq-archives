Stinging Swarm does 117 damage for 65 cost.  Careless Lightning does 99 for
70 mana
Creeping Crud does 210/100; Combust 171/110.

If a critter has his back to you and is not running and you have enough
experience to guess at their remaining hitpoints (doesn't take much) just
use your judgment.  A dot isn't ALWAYS  the way to go, but it usually is.

Well, one would hope that any level 29 druid knows enough not to purposely
kite a critter into adds. :)   And outdoors it's a very stupid druid who
doesn't watch where he's kiting.  A lesson that a few necessary deaths
should teach 'em. ;)
