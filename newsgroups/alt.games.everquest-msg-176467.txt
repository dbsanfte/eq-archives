You're very sad. Rush, Jethro Tull, Iron Maiden and all the other shit. =
It's alright for you, Dead Bollocks, because you'd be dead. The rest of =
us poor bastards would have to listen to that garbage.

If you want to show homage to some black rap artists, I suggest you go =
out and shoot a couple of teenage girls at a party. Seems to be the =
current trend from that musical direction.

"Christian songs"??? BWAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAA!!!

Who d'you think you are, Harry fucking Seacombe?

Oh, and you should never mention the words "music" and Public Enemy" in =
the same post. It's a bit like putting "Michael Barrymore" and "swimming =
lessons" together.

Get a grip, preferably before you die, soft lad.

  As I said previously, one of my goals would be to create a musical =
document that would be here after I am gone in 3.46 years composed of =
music from the past so that you would have something else to help guide =
you.

  The main features of the music included will be this

  1)Music with lyrics that seem to have some bearing on these end times =
some of which were written as many as 30-35 years ago. BOC, Rush, Jethro =
Tull, Iron Maiden, Queen, Marillion, etc.=20

  2)An attempt to show homage to black rap artists to give them the =
respect they deserve, especially the ones with a more negative, =
creative, rebellious attitude. Ice-T, Public Enemy, L.L. Cool J, Mr. =
Snoop Doggy Dogg, DMX, etc.

  3)Will probably mix in some classic Christian songs eventually as that =
is the most rebellious thing you can possibly do right now.

  Here is the link to the station, it's really rough right now but I =
suppose I have 3.46 years to complete it.=20

  I'll be adding some Public Enemy tracks today and posting the lyrics =
for the ones I like on here and posting the lyrics for every song I add, =
it may take a while as I don't know much about Public Enemy, God seems =
to have led my mind in that direction.=20

  About 6 months before the end I will put them in order and create kind =
of a countdown of the 500 best ones or something as I like to do. =20
