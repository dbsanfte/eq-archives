SNIP

At level 30 my warrior got the resistance discipline. (Pretty average) At
level 30 my ranger got SoW and Stinging Swarm plus new buffs.
In EF hunting Mammoths my warrior died several times, once when 2 adds
aggroed with low hp, and a few other times when Martar Icebear jumped me
with low hp. No SoW mean't quick death. At other times I could kill perhaps
3 mammoths before the long wait regenerating hp.
My ranger started fear kiting mammoths at 25, and started killing Martar as
soon as he conned yellow. With track to help get to the mammoths first and
fear kiting I could chain kill mammoths almost non-stop.
At around 35 soloing with my warrior became impractical. Went to Overthere
and began the long LFG. At 35 my ranger was in OT soloing. Kept hide skill
on a hot key and avoided the "goons" whilst my warrior was often fleeing to
zone like a wimp.
At 40 my warrior got the Fearless discipline (WOOT) not used in OT or later
DL. At 39 my ranger got more spells, better buffs, a 90 (now 100) healing
spell and levitate. Levi, SoW and invis made the FM-FV run much better.
At 40 my warrior started LFGing in DL (ugh), my ranger avoided DL altogether
and went to EW.
At 49, 50 and 51 my ranger got new spells, signifigantly improving his
prowess, my warrior got the shaft.
At 52 and 53 my warrior 1 discipline per level, evasive and charge, not bad
but not great. He will get 1 discipline per level til 60. My ranger will get
2-3 spells per level.
My warrior has stacks of hp and better AC gear. My ranger fear kites and
rarely gets hit.
Oh and my ranger hasn't bought food or drink since that first stack ran out,
except, ofcourse, stat enhancing grub.
I complained once that warriors suck and was told to choose another class.
So I did.
