Well that's a very good question and gets to the heart of the matter. I first 
raised the question in reaction to those who were not simply indifferent 
to the guys suicide but were expressing sentiments akin to joy. Feeling
compassion for him and glee that he killed himself seemed to me to be 
opposite sides of the same coin.

I don't think any of us, at least I can't, feel true empathy or compassion for 
other's I don't personally know. The events of 9/11 are an example of this. 
Living in Canada on the west coast, I didn't know any of the victims, and 
while I experienced emotions such as anger, hatred and a desire for 
revenge against those responsible, the best I could do with respect to the 
victims is feel sorrow and sadness for them and their families. I could
imagine how I or my family would feel and in that respect could empathize.

The value of compassion I believe lies in it's public expression, even if
in the strictest sense it's not sincere. I believe a society is diminished if 
it doesn't promote the best of what humans could be and challenge anything
less. In this respect we should follow the old adage which many of us were
taught as children--if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything 
at all. And in the case of a mentally ill person committing suicide, the best
we could be would be to feel true love and compassion. Idealistic ? Yes.
Practical ? Probably not. But something a society should strive towards ? I 
think so.

So after all this babbling, the short answer to your question, is I don't 
know why we should, if we are even able, to feel compassion, it just 
seems to be the right thing to strive for.

Jim
