I think the other guy should have just let it go at the 'don't do it again'.
But no, he /tell'd back or whatever and decided to make an issue of it.
Perhaps the original poster was being an ass - and I agree with most others
here that assessed it that way - but.... Call me old fashioned but it takes
2 to tangle.  Had the other guy just brushed off the 'don't do it again'
comment, like most any of us would have, they probably wouldn't have spoken
again about it - problem solved.

As always, I'm sure there are some tasty details of the exchange we're
missing here only hearing one side of the story.
