I've been told (don't know for sure, my guild doesn't power level... though
sometimes we power de-level) that the trick to power leveling is to group
with someone at the top end of his grouping range, and have them pull
greens.  They'll be easy kills for the rest of the group, and he will get
full xp value for them, even if they get none.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
