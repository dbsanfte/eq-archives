You should find better scouts to group with. If the tank is taunting and 
managing aggro appropriately, a decent scout should have no trouble 
keeping the hits they take to a mimimum.

*Too* easy, actually. See my previous post.

You're limiting them unnecessarily. They have additional abilities that 
are left under-utilized when you do.

Any class that has a low-aggro, ranged attack makes a better puller than 
a tank class, especially when you add tracking to the equation.
