Posting again because I thought of something else.  If you are going to
tradeskill create a character with high Wisdom or Intelligence.  It will
help a lot with advancing the skill.  When I first tried to tradeskill I
used my first ever character, a rogue, with neither high intelligence or
wisdom.  It was very slow going and I finally gave up.
