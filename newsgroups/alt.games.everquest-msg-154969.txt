Actually, PoP is supposed to be more like that.  Still, I don't know how
much stategery you can have when mobs poof and teleport to compensated for
buggy pathing.  Add, on top of that, verant's tendancy to go with
healing-intensive encounters, and it's possible that PoP will be practically
unplayable for any but the most uber guilds.
