/bonk Graeme - stop spreading misinformation!!! :)

Int and wis are equivalent for tradeskill purposes, your skillup rate
is determined by the higher of the two. Your success/failure rate is
determined by your skill level. 
For smithing, str helps with learning, and with fletching and
tailoring, dex helps with learning. This means either that high
str/dex will give an extra bonus to skillup rate on top of int/wis, or
that high str/dex will be used to determine skillup rate if it's
higher than the character's int/wis (ogre smiths and ranger fletcher
and tailorers would benefit from that)
There might be some learning differences between high int and high
wis, but they are in other things than tradeskills.
