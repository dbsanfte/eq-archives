 Useful like a Necro or Mage pet is? No. Useful for farming greenies for
tradeskill items and faction? Yes. I think it's worth getting but I
wouldn't spend a lot of money on it. Ask whatever guild does Tunare on
your server, chances they have a few in the guildbank, assuming they
bother to keep them.
