The main difference between the first iteration of the DX9 cards (9700
etc) and current cards is that the 9700 used Pixel Shader 2.0
technology (DirectX 9.0 specification). Later cards use Pixel Shader
2.1 technology (DirectX 9.0 b and c).

Without making this too complicated you can read about both of them
here on ATI's site:
http://www.ati.com/companyinfo/glossary/includes/list.html#smartshader21

So if a game is coded using the latest DirectX (9.0c) it will use
cinematic lighting and shades which to show properly uses Pixel Shader
2.1 (ATI calls it SmartShader .. it is the same thing).

It is marginal for the reasons above .. was good in it's time but being
left behind ... no offense meant just a fact.

No ... because DX9 software had not appeared and when it did was using
the first version of DX9.0 ... as outlined above.

I guess the point I am making is that the programmers have probably
migrated to Pixel Shader 2.1s now and this could be causing this
problem.  On this I am guessing but I think it is plausible.  Does
anyone know whether SOE are coding to DX9.0b or c?
