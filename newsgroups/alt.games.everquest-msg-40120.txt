What I have seen in most online guides is make stuff and throw it away or
sell it to an npc.  That's a good way to throw away money.  At the early
levels it's metal bits but you use those later.  I made everyone I know, and
they were all lowbies, toolboxes.  I even gave toolboxes to newbies in front
of qeynos.

But after that I only made stuff I could sell to other players.  Bakeware
was an early seller.  Mostly high level people bought them so sometimes it
would take a while but they eventually sold.  As soon as I was close I
started on banded and have only sold to other players (except for one batch
of small boots which I couldn't even give a way).  Some of those other
players were ex-newbies with toolboxes needing banded. ;-)  I never got
rich, but I bet I've either made my investment back or I'm close to it.  By
the time I hit FP, except for failures which gets lower, it's all profit for
me.  I'm level 17 now.  When I hit 30 I bet I have a hefty sum in the bank.

You can make money!  It just depends on how you play it.

It is time consuming though.  And I don't know what you're warrior is
wearing but even a full suit of bronze won't cover the cost, I don't think.

A big caveat: If you don't enjoy the RP of a craft (and the associated
Tradesman role) then it's a lot easier and probably more fun to just go kill
stuff.  It feels great though when I get a tell "Soandso told me to talk to
you. I need a full set of banded."
