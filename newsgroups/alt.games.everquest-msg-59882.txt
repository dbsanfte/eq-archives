You have a device conflict.

Right click on My Computer. Selct Properties. Click on the Hardware Tab. click
on the Device Manager button under Device Manager and see if there's any
Exclamation Marks (!) associated with any devices. If so then double click on
the device to find out what's wrong with it and/or remove it and reboot. If
not, well, something else is wrong somewhere.

FWIW. I've been using Windows 2000 for a while now and I've never had a single
blue screen, and never had any Windows related problems with Everquest. But I
happen to be an out of work systems administrator so it would be quite
embarrassing if I did have problems.
