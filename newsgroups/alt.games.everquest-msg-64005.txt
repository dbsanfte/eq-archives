Aye

I never heard one Guildmate or groupmember ever complain about the Tooth
issue. In fact, it was nice when Raiding to know who had been to these areas
before. I agree with the rite-of-passage thing, like the HS and VP key.

I wish the Tooth method had been extended to Befallen and ToFS, not removed
from the game.

Keyrings would be great! A Befallen set, ToFS set, Velious rings, HS, VP....

Maybe even a 'Master' set!
