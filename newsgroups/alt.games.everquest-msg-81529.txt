Yes from my experience the trial  indicated that it was on separate 
servers which would need the chars transferring over when you 
subscribed. This definitely wasn't the case for me. As soon as I 
subscribed I was live and had been playing on the main servers since day 
1 ;)

Out of interest after trying the trial and liking it I then got the 
Trilogy pack this actually installs to separate directory and you then 
need to fully patch and run it from this. Can be the same in game 
account (you loose your free month if you do use same in game account), 
just different exe location. What I did is played from my old location 
and in spare moments like overnight and when not playing I would have 
the patch running for the trilogy pack.

Now they have made the user interface the same for all users as Velious 
i.e full screen inventory except for the additional areas I would say 
there was little advantage. For me I will definitely be exploring these 
areas so glad I got it. However the manual is not different from the 
online one.

Got the Luciln add on yesterday, if you have a machine that can handle 
this would heartily recommend it. It installs to your main game 
directory, which for me was then the trilogy directory. Its 3cds. But 
adds greatly (IMHO) to the graphics. Now find caves and towns much 
easier to navigate and everything seem better defined.

If you went down the route of

Trial -> Luciln ->Trilogy

I would recommend that after you had installed trilogy you then 
reinstalled Luciln over the trilogy directory THEN patched as the patch 
will subsequently be smaller. The trilogy doesn't give the option where 
to install (as far as I can remember). Obviously will take up huge 
amounts of disk space, but you can uninstall EQ from trial directory 
afterwards.

Also note that as the trilogy is installing to a different directory you 
need to copy your eqclient.ini over otherwise you will loose your 
keymappings etc.

For info my machine seems to handle it with little degradation from 
previous graphics (very occasional stutter) is a

AMD K 1000, Geforce II MX, 512MB

I set the texture caching on, even though it recommends off, if you have 
the disk space use it!
