A common problem that i had a few months back. Simply hit F10 and refresh
your screen res a few times, this will/should sort the problem.If that
fails, change your res to a higher one in the options screen (in-game) then
change it back to the one you use, this will sort the problem if F10 doesnt
work.]

Good luck!
