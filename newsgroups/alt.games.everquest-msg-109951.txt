    Even if they allowed you to port over your current character (I'm not
interested in levelling up again, thanks), if there's item decay and housing
then I'm not interested. I'd rather go back and buy all the software titles
I never played while playing EQ than go through that, because I play for
content and not for eye candy. I'll be watching their announcements VERY
closely over the next few months.
