Consider that the bazaar is limited to 500 players. There are less
than 50 servers. It's highly unlikely many servers, if any, have much
more than 500 dedicated bazaar mules, since the competition over spots
is likely to discourage people. Most servers also don't have a full
bazaar most of the time, I believe (e.g. The Tribunal, which is the
highest population server I play on, has never reached the cap while I
was paying attention to the bazaar, and there are quite a few low
population servers that probably don't even hit 400 with any
regularity). So figure 20k bazaar mules (almost certainly too high a
number), that leaves 10k "real" additional accounts.

Consider also that they just recently had over 110k accounts logged in
simultaneously, which was a new record.

Doesn't seem to me as if people are quitting en masse.
