The point, you snivelling moron, is I WASN'T wrong. I never said nor
did I ever THINK that the equipment on that character was real. YOu
and the rest of the smartasses think your mindreaders and are trying
to bully me into giving in. It ain't gonna happen because I know I am
not guilty of what I am being accused.

Why don't you admit that you were mistaken in thinking I "fell for
it"? Hmm? Because you're certain you're right. What the FUCK makes it
any better for you not to "admit" to your mistake?

Fucking hypocrite. Back into my killfile until you get your head out
of your ass.
