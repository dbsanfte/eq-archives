The idea of selling in-game content for real world cash has stirred a lot of 
controversy over the years. I've argued that it's an inevitable extension of 
the free marketplace to the gaming worlds that are now starting to attract 
big attention as the big publishers smell all the money being left on the 
table at eBay and IGE. I haven't actually made up my mind whether I think 
it's a good thing or not for games, but I know that many people reading this 
message despise it with a passion. Part of this is probaby because making 
money in the real world is a lot harder than making it in the game worlds, 
and anything that gives an advantage to one group over the other is bound to 
piss off a lot of folks. But you know, you still have to be resourceful 
enough to earn the money one place or the other, right?

Anyway, there was a bit of an uproar when SOE's Smedley hinted at the 
company's sanctioning of this practice in a recent communication, and now 
Microsoft is suggesting the idea of institutionalizing it in their online 
game world, at least on the console side initially with the idea of 
"micro-transactions". Check out the story here.

Here's an interesting question: how do you think this bodes for Vanguard, 
Microsoft's upcoming MMOG that is currently on the must-watch list of most 
hardcore MMOG'ers and designed by Brad McQuaid, one of the most vocal 
opponents of this practice?
