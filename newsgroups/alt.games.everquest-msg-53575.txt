I've started about 5 different characters. All very low levels ( < 10 )
except my Dwarven Paladin... I really like the character A. Because it's a
dwarf, I mean how much cooler can you get except maybe a Drow... B. I love
blowing up skeletons..  C. I like being shorter than most of the people in
my group and then saving their asses with Lay Hands... D. I havent spent as
much time on the other characters to really compare and I've had more fun
with the dwarf
