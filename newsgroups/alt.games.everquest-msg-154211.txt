Nah...none of 'em are 60, unless General V'Ghera is spawned...
and if he's spawned, there is probably a massive CR going
on.

All the DEs that are normal spawns in the cabin vary from level
55 to level 59.  They are, of course, DEs...and suffer from
Ambassador D'Vinn syndrome...they are MASSIVE undercons,
and will eat folks up who aren't ready.  But they ARE blue to a 60.

General V'Ghera is level 63 and a melee monster.  He also
Lifetaps.  He's a good practice mob for a smallish guild getting
into raiding, because when GVG is allowed to ping-pong aggro,
he makes folks dead fast.

Hell, he doesn't even hit that hard...but he hits really fast
and likes to quad...
;-)
