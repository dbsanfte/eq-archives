You don't sell it back to the horse vendor...there are stable hands near the
horse vendors in bazaar.  Find the one that correpsonds to the color of
horse your friend has and "give" him the bridle.  In return he will give you
a bag of platinum pieces that can be sold to a regular NPC merchant for less
than what he paid for the horse.  That's how I sold back my horse.

IMO, the graphics for the horse are much better...don't think I'll be lining
up to buy a lizard any time soon, unless I make a frog or troll.
