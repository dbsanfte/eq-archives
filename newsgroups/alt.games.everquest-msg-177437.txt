How about this one...  Logged on after the patch...merrily bringing up
a new Enchanter pet - aggro a mob - nuke it...and THEN..........I hit
it with Theft of Thought.

Now for those of you non-chanters out there...ToT is a mana tap which
is supposed to TAKE from the mob and GIVE to the chanter.  But this is
not exactly how it works now.

NOW - when you cast ToT...not only do you NOT get any mana from the
target but *ALL* the mana in  YOUR mana bar evaporates down to 0%.

ROFLMAO...I love the new and varied ways Verant can find to screw
things up...looks to me like like some coder can't tell the difference
between a + and a - sign.
