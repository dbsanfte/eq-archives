Just about all of them.  "Normal" US Constitutional law doesn't
apply to members of the United States Armed Forces, the UCMJ
does.  And the protections under it are strictly limited in
comparison with civilian law.

The UCMJ generally parallels civilian law, but it's all parallel,
not a recognition of the same, unbounded rights granted to all US
citizens.
