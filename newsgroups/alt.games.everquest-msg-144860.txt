Yes.  After many long minutes of discussion, Sony/VI finally pulled the plug
on EQ, today.  One high-level employee was heard to say, "Let's see them
petition that, the whiny little bastards".  Another senior marketing manager
washeard to say, "We're not worried.  EQ2 and SW:G are just around the
corner, and we know that all the players will flock to these like the
lemmigs theat they are."

It is well-known among the usenet world that EQ was boring and poorly
designed.  Also, there was much proof that the only reason for the game was
to make a few individuals, in so-called "uber guilds", apopleptic with rage
(the evidence was usually seen through a few websites and the "dick-waving"
rants thereon).
