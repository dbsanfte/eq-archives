Did you send a follow-up to eqmail@soe.sony.com?  If you did, and you 
still didn't get a response, AND you believe there is some truth this this 
jerk's boasting, I would call CS and explain there someone is posting to 
public forums claiming that the GM on <server> is having him continually 
train people the GM doesn't like.  Ask to speak to a supervisor if you 
must.
