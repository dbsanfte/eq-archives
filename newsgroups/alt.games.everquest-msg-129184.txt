Thank you for calling Sony Online Entertainment Customer Care. Your call is
important to us, though not as important as it is to you. If you are calling
from a touchtone phone, press or say 1. If you are calling from a
rotary-dial phone, please stay on the line while a customer-care
representative makes mocking, derisive faces. Para assistencia en espanol,
go to South America and try your call again.
Your call may be monitored and/or recorded for staff enetertainment
purposes. For security reasons, please enter the last four digits of your
junior hight school locker combination, followed by your mother's pet name
for your father on evenings when she's had too much sherry.
To save us money and expidite the dismissal of customer-care
representatives, our express automated-speech response system is now
available. To use this system, press 1.
To speak with a customer-care representative, call the Verant Interactive
unemployment office. To hear these options again, hang up and call back.
Welcome to the express automated-speech response system. Please say your
67-digit personal account number, located on the upper lower left middle
corner of the one page of your bill that has gone missing, followed by the
pound sign, say Ding Dong.
I heard: 894375904279643850432759478847686350542356889448590824837698072459.
If this is correct, say Yes. If this is not correct, it's your fault. You
are mumbling, or have a funny accent.
For payment information, say Payment. If you have error codes and are being
dropped to desktop, say Pinhead. To hear these options again, say Attention
Span of a Gnat. To hear the call of the long-toed stint, say kirrrrr-PIP!
Wacka wacka wacka!
Welcome to the automated payment information center. Our records show a
payment of $12.95 was posted on January 23, 2002, following a 12-day
processing period, during which time Accounts Receivable Clerk June Smetak
was unaccountably absent and consequently your payment was recorded six days
after the due date. A late fee of as much as we can possibly charge without
government intervention has been posted to your account. Accounts Receivable
Clerk Smetak has been promoted. Whoever said life was fair?
To exit the express automated-speech response system, press or say 1. To
enter your 67-digit personal account number again for no special reason,
press or say 2.
Please wait, a customer-care representative will be with you shortly, or be
short with you, or something. Currently all of our representatives are busy
helping delute our profits. Calls will be answered in the order in which we
feel like. Your expected wait time is 42 minutes. Your expected blood
pressure is 210/130. You may hear clicks followed by silence. You may hear
"Whole Lotta Love" done entirely in strings. You may hear yourself say
regrettable things, which may be monitored and/or recorded.
For example, our records show that you used the phrase "gabbling nitwit"
during your last call to customer care. This has been soulmarked to your
account and will be reflected in the quality of service you receive and the
tone of voice of the customer-care representative, should you somehow manage
to reach one.
I'm sorry, 0 is not a valid prompt, even if pushed furiously 11 times in
rapid succession.
To use our express automated-speech response system, press 1. To hear our
website address, press 2. To speak to someone about your anger-management
problem, press 3.
3 is not a valid prompt. Thank you for calling.
