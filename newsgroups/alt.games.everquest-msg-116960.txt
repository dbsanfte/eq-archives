My druid was "warmly" to Coldain while in wolf form before he got high
enough with CoV to start doing quests in SS.  Dragons are much harder to
impress than frozen Dwarves <g>.  No need to do Kael raids if that is
not in your plans though, but it is much much faster than any other
route.  My druid didn't do Kael but he did CoV quests for quite a long
while.
