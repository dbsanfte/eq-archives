He broke NO rules, once the corpse becomes public access anyone can
loot it.  The other person either didn't care about the loot or was in
a coma for several minutes after killing the mob.  Tough.

Caveat: Obviously *common sense* exceptions apply to raid level mobs,
sometimes takes several minutes to sort out even fairly minor loot (eg
Lodizal) and if some non-raid muppet comes and ninjas a map piece or
whatever then, yes, time to involve a GM.
