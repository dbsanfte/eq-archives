I'm not sure what their equipment is like, but I've had 2 guild friends 
tell me their wizards could handle HGs at 29.  That, btw, is highly 
depressing when your necro is still getting eaten by them at 34 :(  
Anyway, one of them I suspect is at least a little twinked, seeing as 
she has a higher level char.  I think the other is about normal 
equipment, as that's the only char I've ever seen her play.

Although I suspect she uses KEI.
