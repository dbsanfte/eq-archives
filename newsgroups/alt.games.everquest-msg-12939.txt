A guild-mate insists on using an awful, quaint version of "ye
old-fashioned English". You know... the sort that never existed
anywhere outside of Hollywood. My nickname for him is Dick Van Dyke;
i.e. an American trying to do an English accent, and thinking they
sound *really* authentic. Mistakingly.

A lot of fantasy figures originate from Scandinavian folklore
(including Trolls) but, again, not the easiest of cultures/languages
to anglicise with an accent.

Just do what sounds good to you, and seems suited to your character.
As all the NPCs speak English, and so "Common Tongue" can be thought
of as being synonymous with English.... whatever tweeks of certain
words to give the desired effect would be fine, I think. So long as
you're still understood ;)

If you're going to use Scottish phrases/words, you're really best to
limit it to the "race" which wears Scottish clothing (natives of
Halas). This wouldn't apply to dwarves IMO.
