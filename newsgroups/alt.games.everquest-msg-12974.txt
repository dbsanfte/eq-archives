Yes, a non-Paladin can complete the quest.  I did it with my ranger and gave
the sword to a pally friend of mine that I've hunted with quite a bit.

Even though I did the quest, I agree that paladins should be the only ones
that can do it. There is way too much competition in places like highkeep to
get one of the components needed and its a shame that pallies have to
compete with other classes just to get their own sword.
(For the record, when a pally showed up looking for the components, I left
the area until he got what he needed. I don't think other classes should
hinder a pally from getting what is rightfully his.)
