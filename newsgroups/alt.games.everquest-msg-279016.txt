They've actually been fairly open about these changes.  The short
version is:

A)  Non-primary stats don't have much effect.  That's not the way
it was planned.  We're changing damage tables to reflect this.

(IOW, *if* you concentrated solely on your primary stat, prepare
for a nasty surprise when the damage tables go live.)

B)  You need to upgrade your spells/abilities to get maximum benefit
from them.  As it is they scale *much* better than we expected, so
we're going to change the spell/ability system so they don't scale as
well.

(IOW, you're going to lose a lot of power on *older* spells we
didn't expect you to keep using.  And you're going to be forced
to either upgrade ALL your spells to AdeptIII or make choices
which actually matter on the ones you do.)

Players adapt much better than anyone can predict.   I think a lot of
the "they don't understand how the game works" symptoms are due
to "they don't understand how *well* players manipulate the system"
instead.

I'm a bit peeved they're making changes this major this long after
the game went live but a lot of it is understandable IMO.  It's
almost impossible to predict how players are going to manipulate
the system.   Most healers still use T2 heals, for example, at level
50 in addition to their T5 heals.   I doubt that was expected.
