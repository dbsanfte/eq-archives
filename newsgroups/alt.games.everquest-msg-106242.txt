Of course it is.

Well, thats a rather crude way of putting it, but that is generally my
position.

The Rogue quest, compared to the other epic quests, is extremely easy,
especially considering the reward is one of the most valuable.

Heh.  Yeah, I know.  I've heard all the bitching from the level 53 rogues who
have been stuck on the Kedge piece for almost two whole weeks.  /comfort

Nope.  I had to ask my entire guild to help me.   As opposed to your quest,
where almost no fights require major raids.   The general, I suppose. Renux?
Heh.  If you really want to you can try to argue Phinny, but I think thats
getting more than a bit silly.

> SO much hard work for YOU.

Yep.  Hard work for everyone.   Unless you're trying to claim that I'm just
getting summoned up to loot... I don't see how you can take the position that
I'm doing no work to get my Sky piece.

Yeah, sure...  every time you do them you get a golem ball.  Sample size of
one, perahps?  I'm trying really hard not to flat out call you a liar, but
considering that my experience included 2 golem balls in over 30 golem
kills... and four golem balls to date, it's really pretty difficult.   One out
of ten times qualifies as rare, especially on a contested mob.  (as a note,
we've had the "fucking slime blood" drop twice during that time, and soul
leech about 4 or 5.)

Liar.  (damn, and I was so close)
