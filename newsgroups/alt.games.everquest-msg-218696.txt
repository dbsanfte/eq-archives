Sometimes I am amazed by the inability of people to understand a
statement or it's sentiment if it isn't spelled out for a first
grader's comprehension.

I will protest anything my country does that I disagree with, but
never on foreign soil.  If I'm not convicted enough to be on US soil
to protest then I won't do it.  Doesn't mean I'll support, but I won't
join in with foreign powers against my country.
