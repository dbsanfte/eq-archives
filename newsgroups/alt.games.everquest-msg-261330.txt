First time I heard about stuff like that I though 'Stupid bad idea and 
another place for the government to stick their noses in where it is not 
needed'

Then I worked tech support.

I tell you, the thing that just drives me up the wall is not people who 
don't know anything, its people that won't LEARN anything. We have about 
150 customers (of several thousand) that call back over and over for the 
same damn things over and over. How do I print a webpage. How do I 
connect. Yes, we have a woman who just completely forgets how to bring 
up the Internet about once every 1-2 months. She's been on the Internet 
for 4 YEARS. And you have to explain in detail...
'Ok double click on X'
'What do you mean double click?'
urrr... I gotta go... tech call.
