I'm hoping that they're making damn sure they don't break anything
before it goes live. This is to me the least of the changes (if done
correctly, and the effort stays more or less the same), but how it
is implemented can have really adverse effects, so I'm glad if they
postponed it to get it Just Right (They managed to break faction hit
messages in a patch that had nothing to do with them, fercrissakes!).

I'm kinda disappointed that the spell book seems to still live after
this patch, though. That thing is an abomination unto Rallos! Well,
actually, Rallos doesn't care about it, probably, but an abomination
unto Solusek then, ok?
