Yes

But I figured out the problem.  As usual, no matter how long I spend
tracking down an asnwer before positng I can ALWAYS find the answer within
ten minutes of posting.  It should be a lesson to me to wait ten more
minutes before posting no matter how long I've already been working on a
problem.

Anyway, this appears to be happening to a lot of people and is related to
custom U.I. features that are not compatible with the last patch.  I was
able to correct the problem by deleting my custom file so it would use the
default UI file.  Other people are still having problems, but this worked
for me.
