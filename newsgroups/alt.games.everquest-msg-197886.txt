Someone maybe able to explain the problem a little better but basicly it is
a bug in Win9x where, over 512mb Ram, it uses all of it for a
Swapfile/Vcache for it's own use and leaves no ram available for games/apps,
so they end up crashing. If I got that wrong, didn't explain it totally or
whatever feel free to enlighten me on it, it was a while ago I read up on it
and, tbh, was more interested in the fix than the problem.
Anyway under Vcache in system.ini

maxfilecache 393216

This was what I used when running 768mb and it worked fine but I have
recently read in a Q3 forum that for games this is best set to 64mb
something like

minfilecache 65536
maxfilecache 65536

I never tried this so not sure if it works better or not and there were
other settings suggested here but I don't remember them, try doing a search
on for maxfilecache or vcache settings.

Best fix would be to use an OS that isn't Win9x
