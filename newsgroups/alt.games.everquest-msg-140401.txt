Well, in all fairness, it can be pretty much a no brainer getting a
druid from level 1 to 60.  Root and Rot, a technique that becomes
useful at level 14, can get druids to 60 no problem.  If they can
learn to quad it can happen even faster.  And quadding is hardly a
really advanced hunting tactic.

Now playing a druid WELL, and playing a druid in grouping situations
requires some skill and flexibility.  Push comes to shove though,
druids are one of the easier classes to level.
