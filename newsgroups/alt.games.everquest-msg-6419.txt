There's nothing magical about handing in the note that makes you a member of
the paladins guild.  It all has to do with faction standing.  If you con the
Paladin guild leader, and the message says something to the effect of
"regards you amiably"; you have acheived the highest faction rating possible
and all quests will be available to you.
