I beleive the only time a weapon will increase a pet's damage output
is when its damage is more than half the damage the pet does unarmed.
Of course, a weapon with a proc is nice to give the pet when its high
enough to proc the weapon no matter what the weapon's damage is...
Velium is great. Gnoll hide lariats, too.

I'm pretty sure most of what's true for mage pets is the same for
necro pets as far as damage output is concerned. The differences are
the level they get dual wield and the amount of damage they deal
unarmed...
