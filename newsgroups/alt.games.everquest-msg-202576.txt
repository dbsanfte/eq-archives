<<<<No, you never responded to how you would feel if you had been in a place
for
hours and had one player juiced on KEI come and take all the spawns.

You conviently snipped that part out so that you didn't have to address it.

Get your facts straight.  It's all here ... just look back.

Crash>>>

Again you fail.  The exact problem you reference above is something that
happened in this game long before there was KEI.  Higher levels have been
stealing camps from me since I started playing.  I call them a jerk and move
on.  You think removing KEI is gonna take jerks out of the game you are
seriously mistaken.
