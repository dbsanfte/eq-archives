Is it possible to find out what chat channels are in operation?  Getting a
global auction channel to start would take a stroke of luck or else some
very determined people.  Not that I don't find it a neat idea, but I don't
want to get my hopes up because I don't see how inertia will reverse so
fast.

Speaking of auctions and inertia...has there been any hint of when the
Bazaar will be fully functional?  I noticed in the keyboard options
in-game that a bazaar keystroke now exists (default Alt-R I believe).
