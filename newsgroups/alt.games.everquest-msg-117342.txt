I haven't seen any quests that track the players involved (with the
exception of nodrop items that quest NPCs hand them at different
stages).

In my experience player_2 would complete the quest with only 3 flasks.
I have done this many times.  A lot of times players will have an odd
number of components or mistakenly turn in only some of the requested
items. If a Quest NPC wants two or more of something I always start
off handing them just 1. You would be amazed at how many times you
will complete the quest, because someone else only finished part of
it.

MQs are almost always done with all parties present and turning in
items in quick succession. Perhaps a time limit is involved.
