Yeah, that's the normal way to resolve a PnP call for Ragefire
(or any other contested spawn where the guide/GM isn't familiar
enough with the situation to impose a solution in another way.)

"Not having the force" is your opinion, of course.  Eight
level 60s is more than strong enough to kill Ragefire, if
they have good equipment and the right classes present.
Apparently the guide agreed that he did have the force
necessary.

No, VI and the PnP acknowledges conflicts over spawns.  Ragefire
isn't a *camp*;  he's a spawn.  And an often contested one, too.

Assuming two (or more) groups are contesting the same spawn
and can't reach a compromise, guides or GMs impose one.  And,
yes, that's sometimes (maybe even usually) done via rolls.

> 3rd, ragefire is now appearantly an official camp.

Nothing you've said supports that.  Ragefire was a contested
spawn;  the PnP specifically mentions contested spawns.  If
the guide was going to impose "camp rules" they'd have told
you go leave, period, without a roll.

No, you just don't understand the PnP.
