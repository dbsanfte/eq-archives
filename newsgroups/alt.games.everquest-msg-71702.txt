Hmmm...something just occured to me.  Remember how they purged guilds
that didn't have 10 members?  They ran a query on the database which
produced a list of guilds that needed to be deleted, and then gave the
list to the GMs to do the deleting.  The list did not list the guild
names, but rather listed the guild numbers.  When the GMs did the
deletes, there were a fair number of typos, which wiped out some large
guilds (a typo in a guild *name* would likely give an invalid name,
but a typo in a guild number simply refers to another guild).

I wonder if the character deletion process will be like that?
