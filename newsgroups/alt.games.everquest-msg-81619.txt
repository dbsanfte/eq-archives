Yeah, I guess if you're not in guild situations you wouldn't have a lot of 
bards present.  It seems that all the good bards I know (and quite a few 
bad bards) have been picked up by large and/or uber guilds.  Not a lot of 
unguilded 55+ bards, anywhere.  We've been recruiting since our guild 
formed 9 months ago and finally picked up our first new bard last month.  
We've had 3 others trial and not be admitted, but they were quickly 
snagged by other guilds.
So why were all the bards interested in Itraer Vius?  Looked at his loot 
table, and nothing that really screams Bard in there.  Or were they just 
excited to have something new to kill.

Yep, at level 15, and it's absolutely worthless once you hit 30.  As in 
Verant has flat out stated that it will not work on mobs over a certain 
level, and that it was only designed to be useful up to 25-30.

Just checked it on eqmaps.  Juggs are 57-58.  I'm not an enchanter, but I 
thought enchanters couldn't mezz anything higher than 56 (maybe 57).  I 
just know that if dictate isn't available on at least one enchanter, we 
don't pull until it is.

We buff on the run, have the enchanters use dictate, and kill as fast as 
we can.  We generally finish our buffs in the reet room.  Let's just say 
that it only takes one time for Trak to jump you at the bridge to learn 
your lesson.  It may take a bit longer to pull the Juggs and the big boss 
Jugg back to reets, but I've never seen anything other than random single 
deaths doing it.

Yeah, that's why I learned to CC King.  Chanter couldn't get mezz to 
stick, got killed, I mezzed the adds, kept us alive.  After that I just 
generally preferred to do it.  It was nice when I was 56, I knew that if 
they conned white I couldn't mezz 'em, if they were blue I could.  I'm 
pretty sure that the King is always 56 and all others are 55 or lower.  
I've seen two Kings up once, but not sure if that was a bug.  At 57 an 
enchanter is going to have a tough time there, but should be able to do 
it, might have to Tash first though.

Wow, I know that bards are rare, and probably the least played class 
overall, but I generally see 15-20 bards in that range on Innoruuk at any 
raid time.  Maybe it's just that as a bard, I generally keep tabs on which 
other bards are on.  Bards have a pretty good community, and there seems 
to be a bunch of us who post on the forums, though we're certainly not 
like the rogues or anything.
