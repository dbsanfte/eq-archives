Apologies if this subject has been covered to hell and back but I'm a
desperate man! I have a copy of EQ2 sitting next to my keyboard which I
can't play because my graphics card is not up to scratch (GeForce2 MX400
64Mb). Needless to say I've got to buy a new one but I'm already baffled all
the different cards out there.

Does anyone have a similar PC spec to mine?

Pentium 4
2GHz
512Mb RAM
Windows XP Home
AGP slot
Apprx. 3 years old

If you have and you're happily running EQ2, please, please tell me how you
did it! I'm happy to spend money on a decent mid-range card but not blowing
the bank on something that might melt down my PC.

Any help or advice seized with gratitude.

Rick
