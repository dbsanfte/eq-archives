A thousand monkeys banging on keyboards posted the following under the

This itself is a lie. The statistics have been put up, and they
showed, at multiple instances, that the groups actually bottomposted
more than they top posted, AND that the topposting was restricted to a
couple posters.

I posted the stats. Other people counted the google. The proof is
available in google. Look it up.

There weren't. And all Wharf Rat said was "there does seem to be a lot
of terrible top posted articles". When the stats came out, he conceded
(you on the other hand just ignored them).

For those of you who remember, our young friend @ndrew here had
"MadBomma" has his only support for a while. Who else remembers that
jackass? :-)

You are getting abused because you are a liar, @ndrew.

Given that @ndrew has lost to every single person he has tried to
argue with here to the point that he had to run and hide to get away
from the laughter, I find it exceedingly hard to believe he did any
better against bizbee anywhere else.

Probably because we don't lie, @ndrew. Try it someday.

Time for an @ndrew moment - everyone remember when he tried to claim
he never topposted in the group? Only to get busted for lying... so
then he tried to claim he hadn't topposted in years... only to get
busted for lying AGAIN? With links provided?

Given @ndrew's total lack of credibility now, its a wonder he didn't
try to claim someone was impersonating him....

In @ndrewWorld he is never the one to start flaming, all the
newsgroups he visits prefers topposting, he has never been caught
lying, and the Iraqi Information Minister was 100% accurate....

Most nonsensical paragraph ever. How can you type these things and not

Data was provided. You ignored it, and are lying about it now. The
main link:

<lfar301b45j6nbj5aq61epdn1jmp107ofm@4ax.com>

And links from various people supporting it:

<U44%b.9132$aT1.7782@newsread1.news.pas.earthlink.net>

We are finding a glaring hole in finding links of people supporting
@ndrew....

If you want we could check AGAIN. Maybe after being proven wrong twice
you'll get lucky on the third try?

Your inability to decipher newsgroup attitudes is well known. For
instance, you still have the idea that you're not a newsgroup
laughingstock.
