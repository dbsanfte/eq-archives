I've been reading about the Adventurer's stone, and the total stats that it
gives after completing adventures in all the different camps.  I did find a
list of who to speak to after so many adventures, and the total from each
camp that must be complete to give all the stats.

My question is:  When do you start to see stats on the stone?  Do I have to
complete the total at all 5 camps before I get any benefit?  I was under the
impression that as I did more adventuring, I would slowly get stats until I
maxed it out (Max as I understand is +10 to all stats and 100HP 100Mana)

The other question, is do these stats only work/show up inside a dungeon,
like the low charms that you can buy from the merchants.

Thanks for the help,
