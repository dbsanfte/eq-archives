Well I think the point about LDoNs is debatable. Yes, there's a lot of 
single pulls and with that chanter we did get lucky and have no problems 
but I've seen plenty of bad pulls and unexpected adds occur in LDoN too. 
I have a baby chanter and I guess the proof will be in the pudding but I 
was hoping LDoN might be a fun place for him to learn a little CC.

Your points are well taken though. It is really fun when you've got a 
good group of capable players and take on challenging content. I 
remember going into Old Sebilis once with a group of guildies about as 
soon as we were high enough level to go there I think and boy was that 
fun. It was one heck of a workout for the enchanter there let me tell 
you. It really was for everyone in the group. Several times we got 
ourselves into situations that were highly challenging and survived but 
the fights were intense and exciting. That is EverQuest at its very best 
to me.

So, I hear what you are saying and I agree there is nothing quite like 
playing tougher content with a good group or raiding it with your guild.

I do know just what you mean about how hit or miss pickup groups can be. 
I've had some really great ones and some really terrible ones. That's 
why I like being in a family guild of players who take playing their 
classes well seriously while at the same time all wishing to have fun at 
it - of course, those two things go together, don't they? I prefer to 
group with guildies whenever I can for this reason. But sometimes not 
enough are available for grouping or are busy or whatever and so you 
find yourself putting together your own group and setting out for the 
unknown in more ways than one.

Everyone's points about a person learning to play their class are 
undisputably valid. All I've been saying all along here is that I find 
it hard to believe that a low level warrior getting temped all the time 
so he can play solo for short periods of time, is just having some fun 
and it isn't harmful in my opinion. He isn't going to be able to solo 
for long anyway really. If he thinks the downtime is bad now, imagine 
later on when he starts really getting whacked with no healer at hand, 
no cc, no haste, etc. He'll grow up just fine is all I am thinking. 
Because he is going to have to group and in so doing he will learn to 
play his class. I mean even if he is buffed later on when grouping, if 
he doesn't learn to manage aggro his groups will still wipe because of 
it and then he will die too with nobody to heal him despite his buffs. 
And this will all happen long before he ever gets to his 60's. Hell, 
it'll probably happen in PC, assuming he goes there.

I just rolled a Ogre Warrior the other day and couldn't believe I was 
able to kill two blues in Gloomingdeep and had so many hitpoints for my 
level with the little buff they give you there that I still had 75% 
health I think it was. I think he's going to be a lot of fun. But you 
know, I am going to grab temp for him when I can, not so I can be in 
"God mode" but simply because it will reduce my downtime and deaths 
hopefully. I still intend to focus on learning to play the class 
properly and I don't think it's going to adversely affect me in that 
regard. Although I will say I am not going overboard with that. If I can 
grab a temp great, more fun. But if I can't get one easily I am sure not 
waiting around for it. I'm going to go play.
