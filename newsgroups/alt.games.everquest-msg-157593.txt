I can speak from personal experience when I say that the L-Fay DE group can
not be completely harmony pulled, at least thats what happened to me.

Heres the story. Went out to try the DE's with my druid. Started Harmony
pulling and was able to sucessfully single pull 3 of the DE's. NEVER get the
"your taget is immune!!"  message. Decided that I wanted to try and get a
clarity in the bazaar so I bound outside the camps agro radius, and ported
to the moon. A couple of VERY Lucrative ports came up in /auc so I ported
them, and used the proceeds to purchase a C3. Then medded up a bit and
returned to the DE Camp. I targetted a Tier 'Dal Prophet. DARK BLUE to my
level 37 Druid, in fact the entire camp ( unless there were several that
were invis/hidden in the tents ) were dark blue to my druid.  Fired of a
Harmony on the Prophet, and low abd behold I get a couple of different "Your
target is immune!" messages.

So unless there is somthing special about the DE camp in L-Fay, the bar is
MUCH lower than the originally though level 40.

Needless to say I decided to say the heck with it and went out to Root/Rot
Giants in GD.
