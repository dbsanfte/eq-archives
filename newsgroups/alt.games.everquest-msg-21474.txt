You know, One would think that would make sense.  And as a cleric of some 35
levels now, I'd agree with you.  However, others would not.  I was in a group
the other day for over 4 hours when our bard left. So we replaced him with this
level 37 enchanter that came wandering by.  Obviously some sort of Uber Twink
from a high level character.
    One fight in, she anounces that she wants all action to stop for a minute
because "She has something to say".  She yelled at me by saying "DONT TANK"
because I was whacking the mobs with my big stick for 22 damage a pop.  Even
though I was at full mana and the tanks didn't need healing.
    So okay, I let it slide.....Next fight instead of whacking the mobs with my
stick, I was stunning their asses for 24-70 points a pop depending on what
spell I used.
    So once again, "STOP EVERYTHING"....What now?  "Don't nuke, don't tank,
JUST HEAL"....Wanna know what my answer was? Well, I'll tell you anyway, it
was... "No, you do your job, I'll do mine, don't tell me how to play"....At
this point she disbanded herself from the group in a huff and went her not so
merry way.  Now, I give this answer to any wanna be Uber Twink bitch/bastard
that comes my way trying to tell me how to play, but it's sad how many people
out there believe that a clerics job is to just
Heal/Med/Buff/Med/Heal/Heal/Med.  That's not how I play, and unless I'm in some
constant pull or Raid situation, it's not how I will ever play.   I'm just as
useful Atoning Mezzed mobs and stunning mobs then I am healing the tank.
      A Stoneleer Cockatrice hits a tank for what, 90 damage a pop?  My Force
spell stops it in it's track for 2 ticks and does 70 damage all for 90 mana I
think.  My Greater Healing, heals 200-300 damage for 150 mana.  So by stunning
for 2 ticks, I did 70 damage, stopped 180 worth of damage and saved 70 mana by
not using a Gheal instead.......Sounds like a good deal to me?


Just MY vent,
     Drenzel <Circle of Ttans>
     Cleric of the 35th, 34th, 35th 34th level.

P.S. - My math on the spells may be off, but it still makes sense anyway you do
it.
