My guess is that this is their trial balloon.  They want to guage how
people will react to merging servers, since they know it may be needed
on other servers.  They also want to try to mitigate any repercussions
it might have on people's opinion of Eqlive, so they do it to the
servers that everyone knows are habitually underpopulated.  Also I
would bet that people on the zek servers are the most likely to have
well-played alts on the regular servers, so if it causes problems
technical or otherwise, players still have the blue servers.

Just my reading of their logic...
