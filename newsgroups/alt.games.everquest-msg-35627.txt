Fine steel weapons drop in Everfrost from Icy Orcs & Ice Giants.
Obviously you can't kill them, but you could buy them from the players
camping there for 5pp or less.  The campers often need an ATM to
convert their gold to platinum too.  Keep your eyes open to avoid the
leopards & orcs on the way to those camps.  My advice would be to saty
against the north wall all the way to Perma.  I've often seen Ice
Giant corpses with fine steel weapons left to rot after the coin has
been looted.
