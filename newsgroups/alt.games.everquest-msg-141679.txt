    You'll need RGC if you're in a Ssra-capable guild. If you aren't, you
can quite cheerfully do without it. It's a rare enough drop that you really
don't want to go get it if you aren't going to be using it in the near
future. Camp The Great Saphrophyte instead for Remove Curse and be happy
with that. ;-)

    If you were a druid in a Sebilis group, say, and a druid spell dropped,
I bet you could get it by just asking. Repeat enough times, and you'd have
plenty of extras for sale. You'd have to be a wee bit morally challenged,
but that hardly excludes a ton of EQ players.
