Best way to help him is to stress that his character is ruined. When
someone turns in a note to the priest of discord, it is basically a
quest to ruin their chraracter for all time since all of the other
players on the server are not PK mode so now can't cast or receive
spells on/from that person. This effectively removes the person from
the game because even someone who solos is going to want to group or
have beneficial spells cast on them sometime. It destroys your
character while adding no benefit. Stress the problems to them and ask
them to start over then simply leave since it is not your problem. The
amazing thing is many of them don't listen or understand and say "I
kno I am pk, u don't need to tell me..." and they think they can
handle it then you never see them again.

This is one of my largest pet peeves with EQ, Verant should have
removed or disabled the POD eons ago. I did notice that as a newb you
stop starting with the pod quest book in inventory.. I have no idea
when they did that since they did it quietly and with no announcement.
That shows they even know its bad. Now you have to actually ask the
pod about it but some people still do. He is just an incredibly old
marketing ploy to say players had a choice and a "switch" but they
don't claim that anymore since they have servers for pvp so he is
really pointless and just play stopping. 

He kind of reminds me of the deathtrap in paineel on the way to the
newb area where if you fall in your corpse is pretty much gone unless
you have high level friends to summon it from the hole. Because of
that I'm very careful and scared every time I pass there on the new FV
server.. I mean if you even go link dead when moving forward all your
plat and banded and stuff you'd have a lot of trouble replacing at
that point on a new server would be gone forever.

I have worse credit than your friend ever could, probably. Look on the
web in your city for banks which have a visa checkcard (I just did
this recently) go to the bank, say you have a job and such get the
account and put in like 30 bucks. The visa checkcard comes a week or
so later then use that for EQ. I think the 3 month cards from verant
are in stores so I'll just change to that payment next time but a visa
checkcard will work fine for daoc too.

I took about 95 or 100 days to 50 but I did lots of tradeskill stuff
and messing around. Its not a race really and you can get to 50
casually, Its 51 - 60 that you really can't (well maybe in several
years) Ah the twin accounts and pcs should help you through 51 and
such too.

I've seen no drop, or drop in people raiding in large guilds. Of
course The two are SO different at that point you could really play
daoc since you will be a low regular character and then play your uber
char who raids velious and stuff in EQ during raids. I mean many
people in EQ play like 4 twinks also, you'd simply not play the twinks
and play daoc during those times instead. I don't think daoc will ever
have encounters like EQ does on the high planear/tov/tormax raid end
or loot/armor like it does.
