Half Elves.  Look cool, and get the best and worst of two worlds.

The elves.  Lack in the STR/STA department a bit but good newbie area (even
I who started in FP went to GFay at lvl 2), get night vision, generally look
good, and nature loving.

Have to be my own, Half Elf Paladin.  Worst Paladin combo there is (maybe on
par with Erudite), but it is challenging.  Plus Half Elves look good in
plate.  And no matter what the CHA stat says we are just naturally
charismatic (well, on PCs anyway).  In all probably suits my personality.
