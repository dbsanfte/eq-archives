www.eqatlas.com has a description of which pot goes where.  Plus a boatload
of nice maps too, of course.  I used to use it all the time, now I use Nexus
a fair amount, as I keep myself bound near the DL wizzy spires.  You cannot
bind anywhere in Timourous Deep, as far as I know, and I have tried, so you
cannot bind yourself near the pot room, you must always take a boat to get
into TD.
