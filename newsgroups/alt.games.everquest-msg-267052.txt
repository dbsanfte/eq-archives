My joining EQ2 was for the exact same reasons you did. I just made a
brand new shiny gaming PC and also happened to be in the market for a
new timesink the same week EQ2 came out.

I'm pretty happy with my EQ2 experience thusfar (only have a few minor
gripes regarding tradeskills). One of my favorite things about this
game is I can play it windowed. I'll sick my pet on a mob and then
switch over to the web browser, chat client, or whatever during the
fight. No more alt-tabbing out of a fullscreen game for me. :)
