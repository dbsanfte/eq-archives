For solo... 
Necros, Druids, Beastlords... 

many other classes can solo, Mage, Wizard, Monk, etc....  but the
above 3 are rather well known for their soloability.  

Necros, are awesome solo and in groups, IF the necro knows what he is
doing... and IF somone will let em in a group... this by far was my
hardest class ever to get a group with.

Beastlord was my particular favorite.... they bring alot to the table
in groups, as well as solo.

Druids are good in both arenas......


Good luck, good hunting
