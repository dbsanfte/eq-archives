I phrased that incorrectly.
The point I was trying to get across is that I cant stand the whiners who find
an easy way, use it, find out that it is an exploit, and then complain when they
can no longer use it to get easy xp/loot.
The moment you realise something is an exploit, you really should stop using it,
and preferably petition a guide about it
