I used another program, and somehow my log file got messed up (not saying 
it was the other program, just saying it got messed up just as I started 
using Pasketti's parser) so that a bunch of it was in the wrong time-
frame.  That gave me a major problem with errors.  It was so many lines 
that I couldn't c&p them all at once, so I just gave up and started the 
log over :/
