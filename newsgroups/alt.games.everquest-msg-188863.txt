I'm genuinely sorry you feel that way. Where I grew up, I was taught
you don't step in bullshit and call it ice cream. I feel like we are
at a historic turning point where geopolitics with either be defined
by terrorism, unified pan-global military action, or one superpower
policing the world's ills.

I think that French intrastringence on war in Iraq is leading us much
closer to a time when blackmail and terrorism are the primary tools of
international politics. I think that road leads to nothing but either
a much larger, pan-global war within the next few decades or a new
dark ages. I think they are weaking the United Nations, the European
Union, and the War on Terror.

I don't think anyone in the US seriously wants us to be the world's
policeman. It's a position thrust on us by a reticent and
obstructionist minority who want to stick their heads in the sand
until the bad things go away.

If I lost the thread of this, let me reiterate: I think that French
intrastringence is placing the life of every human being on the planet
in danger. I think that there are plenty of precedents in French
history that demonstrate an unwillingness to deal with known problems,
wait for disasters to happen, then demonstrate their ingratitude to
anyone who rescues them from their own hubris.

I don't consider this racism or ethnic hatred. I recognize that
racists rarely believe themselves to be racist, but I don't believe
there to be a circular causality there. I still treat individuals as
individuals. When they open their mouths, I judge them on the merits
of their ideas. If their reasoning is bad, I'll call them on it.

I'm very hard to argue with in forums like these because I can agree
with every conclusion a person expresses and still consider them an
idiot. I can disagree with you point for point, but admire you for
sound reasoning.  As a thinking Republican with far more friends who
consider themselves liberal than conservative (and I am inclined to
agree with them,) I have this problem a lot.

I find nothing admirable in the French position. I find only fear,
hypocrisy and unenlightened self-interest where I want clear
reasoning. I am distressed by how many of my structural allies I find
equally disingenuous.

If I'm arguing with you, point-by-point, it's generally out of
respect. Believe it or not, I like being proven wrong almost as much
as I like being proven right. If I'm taking you to task, it's because
I think you're arguing badly. I think I've given you a healthy dose of
both in this thread. Your attempt to discredit my knowledge as
"googlesque" was cheap, pointless, and counterproductive to any real
dialogue. Trying to paint me as hateful because I call a national
government onto the carpet for actions I find reprehensible is dirty
pool, trying to muddy the real issues by bringing in unrelated
hot-button issues.

Of course, you may not be fighting dirty. You may really not see the
difference. I hope this clears up my position.
