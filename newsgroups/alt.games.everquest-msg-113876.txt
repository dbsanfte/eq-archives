Some may laugh at me, but the best money and value combo with a low agro is
this combo:
Centi SS in Primary
Centi LS in Secondary

You must have your STA above 100 because you will se a minor drain with this
combo.
I currently have this combo for when I am the 2nd tank or on a raid.

When I am Solo or the main tank I use:
Lupine Dagger in Primary
Centi LS in Secondary

I am currently a 48 Ranger on Bertox and I can say that the Lupy/Centi LS is
an incredible combo for dmg.
