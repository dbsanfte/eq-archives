I know a few bards... they love playing them... you get a new song every
level and get to run faster than SoW ever could... you get to buff and heal
everyone in the group...

and that is where your downside is as a bard... you shoot straight up on the
mob's hate list and they start pounding on you... hard to taunt off of you
then.

I would say that is probably your only downside...
