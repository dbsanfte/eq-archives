Peridot cost roughly 10pp each.  This is indeed not a lot of money...
well
maybe it is in your low 40s.. but the price curve you are familiar with
as a cleric, with each new symbol requiring a far more expensive
reagent than the last, stops there at 44.  Next symbol, Marzin, still
requires the by now cheap peridot, when you'd reasonably extrapolate
that sapphires would be required.  Then you get Naltrons Mark,
which puts the level 44 symbol on a whole group for a single peridot,
meaning you can get away with one or two 'dot per buff cycle in most
situations.   Level 60 Aego turns this into 4 peridot per group but
gives
the higher level symbol and lasts far longer, for a better buffed party
that costs net fewer peridot still... and those peridot now are 10pp
each
out of the funds a level 60 has at his command.

Now look at what reagent conservation does.  Saves you (unless someone
has better figures) about 10% of those peridots.  Look at the POS item
its on, a Runed Mithril Bracer.  Do I want to wear that just to save ten

pp or so a night?  Or do I want to bother swapping it in and out on the
theory that it will save me some pocket change?  Please, I throw out
more
cash value than that destroying gold, silver, and copper because its not

worth lugging around.

PS Necros can save 10% of their Bone Chips.  Mages can save 10%
of their Malachite.  Druids and shaman can save 10% of their Bat
Wings and Fish Scales.  Does this item power scale in -any- way with
-any- of the other focus effects?

Chanters doing chain rune might see some actual cash savings worth
sneeezing at.  Probably not though.
