That's what I do.  The old sniper technique.
Names reported/petitioned recently:
Yourworse
Primary
Casstarr  (don't remember exactly, some form of caster)
Luding Pleeswait (didn't petition as I was camping at the time)

By the way, we (those who petition name) are not forcing the
names to get changed. That is the DM's call.  We are merely
bringing it to someone's attention, as it our right.  If there's
nothing wrong with your name, you don't have anything to
worry about, do you.

Quite a while ago, Verant announced that they would be "cracking down"
on naming violations.  Changing, warning, deleting, etc.  I am really,
REALLY disappointed in VI that this seems to have just been lip service.

*group of guards show up, all burly and tough*
leader says:  We know that we have been lacks in enforcing rule
number XYZ, but we are going to change that.  From now on we
well be paying more attention.  Those whom we find in violation of
rule number XYZ will be whacked with a heavy stick.
*guards all wield a heavy stick and look menacing*
leader says: Oh look!  A pretty flower!
*guards wonder off in a field of daisies*
