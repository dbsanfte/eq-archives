answers to your questions;
1. Everything i saw while sitting a few Meters back from the ruins.
2. dont belive tovax or the "the bitch who kills you for killing bears" are
a factor. 1 had just tovax dead the first time Pyzin popped. just :"the
bitch" dead the second time and both the 3rd time
3. yes got the Gbs
4. LOL no i just entertained the newbies with my eye of zomm and dance with
someone i hadnt seen in a long time who happed to wander past.
another guildmate followed this same plan if you can call it that. and he
gave up after 7 8 hour days only seeing here 2 times
