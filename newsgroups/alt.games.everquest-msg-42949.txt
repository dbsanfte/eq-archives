Aye, he's lower level than the one in SK, aggro to (almost) everyone on
sight.  I was told he's a monk, but he's not, he buffed himself up some
as I watched.  He looks like a madman, there is no faction hit for killing
him, and he drops standard madman stuff (including lots of water)

He also is totally alone, unless you chase him into the water, nothing
spawns near him, and he's on a strict 6 minute clock.  Get an egg timer
and you can read the paper while you med/heal between pops if
you are into that sort of thing.

He's pretty much opposite the zone in from SK, near the two spawn
aviaks... another plan would be to althernate between that spawn
and Jonah.  Unfortunately if I must pay attention, then I'm not
interested in sitting around killing blues on a slow clock.
