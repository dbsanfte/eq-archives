	Well, there's such a thing as "black humor", you know.  It's
common enough during a tragedy.  

	I'm sorry I offended so many people.   Maybe my 3 shifts a
week at the Red Cross shelter has skewed my sense of humor, which
was always kind of wierd.

	(No shit.  I live in Austin Texas and have volunteered 3 
8 hour shifts a week at the Red Cross, caring for the 6K refugees
we've taken in.  OK?  Am I human again 1/2 :-)
