Glad to find another Anklesmasher bearer..  I bought mine this past July.  I gave 25k in
my server's trade channel, after haggling down from 30k in /tell.  This was just before I
dinged 49, and it started proc'ing right after the ding.

I leveled 49-51 mostly at the Plaguebone Thief camp in the Combine City (things are
starting to go low-blue at mid-52, so it's time to move on).

Until September, I had been using Widebladed Greatsword, and Ghoulbane + Sarnak Battle
Shield for many levels.  My 1HS, 2HS and bash skills were capped.  But my 1HB skill was
horrible, so my intent was to use Anklesmasher to cap 1HB, while having a little fun.

I would pull a single PB Thief with Dismiss Undead, then start smacking it around with
Anklesmasher + Sarnak Battle Shield.  After Anklesmasher proc'd snare, or if the mob or
myself hit 50% HP, I'd switch out to WBGS.  Then, if I'd snared the skelly, I'd fire off
Spook Undead and fear-kite it to its death.

Imagine the amazed stares from other classes waiting in line for the camp ;->

I've yet to see a resist on Anklesmasher's proc.

I imagine I'll be hanging on to Anklesmasher, as a utility weapon, for the rest of my
days.  I' don't know if there's anywhere other than the Combine City that's open enough
for me to fear-kite undead, but the technique is invaluable enough that I want to have it
in my arsenal at all times.

My current weapon inventory generates much more DPS than Anklesmasher: War Marshall's
Bladed Staff, Longblade of Vitality + Tae Ew Shield, Heavy Windriders Lance and
Devastating Maul.  2HS, 1HS, 1HB and bash are over 200, piercing and 2HB are coming along
quite nicely.  My H2H is capped ;->

If you're a PAL soloist, Anklesmasher's low ratio is a liability in an extended battle,
but if you get lucky with an early proc it can make things sooo much easier.

Best regards,

Tim ==
