I was the victim of my own stupidity just last night.  I took my half-elf
paladin shopping while I was very sleepy, something I must remember never to
do again.  Some guy had a Dusty Breastplate up for grabs, and having never
heard of it I asked for a look, since I really need new torso armor.  I saw
"HIE" among the allowed races and thought "H slash E, half-elf, check!" and
bought it.  The guy's price was a reasonable 300pp but that constituted 94%
of my character's money.  Now I'm almost broke (again!!) and I have a
useless item cluttering my bank account.  Perhaps I'll start a dwarf
character and trek my pally over to Kaladim to give it to him...
