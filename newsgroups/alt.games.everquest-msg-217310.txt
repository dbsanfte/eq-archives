Carlin's "Seven Words You Can't Say On Television" is an all-time classic,
especially (if I can be permitted a questionable digression) his speech on
Tits (one of the Seven Words).  They sound like a snack food, don't they?
Corn Tits, Cheese Tits, Tater Tits.... bet you can't eat just one!

Ok, text is a horrible way of telling a joke, and I don't have Carlin's
timing IRL anyway.  Gods, is he funny, though.
