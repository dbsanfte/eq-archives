And the chain is named after breasts, features busty scantily clad women 
in most of its advertising, views hooter girls like cheerleaders... er 
and put a owl in the logo to, in their own words, "allow for debate".

If they could just say "Hooters" refers to the chain and not breasts, 
then they wouldn't need the Owl now would they?

That's ridiculous. 

Lets just imagine for a moment the local male stripper company calls 
their dancing troupe the 'Cocks' and features a particular stylized 
rooster as the logo. If she were wearing a shirt with that particular 
stylized rooster and the word 'Cocks' beneath it, you are saying it 
would now be ok because it is a clear reference to a product or brand of 
some sort?

Now this much at least is true.

They were protesting being subjected to messages on shirts they found 
offensive and degrading to women. It was a peaceful and clever way to 
make their point. Many schools have dress codes that prevent students 
from wearing clothing advertising strip bars, porn stars, or bearing 
vulger, sexist, or racist slogans.

The girls were quite right to be suspended. The boys however should have 
been suspended first, and had they been, this never would have happened.

And your point?

If NAMBLA starts recruiting at your local school you'll keep your mouth 
shut because you don't want to give NAMBLA any free publicity?
