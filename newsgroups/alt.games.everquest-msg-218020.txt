I like it.

I'd actually prefer something more visceral than 'points'. You know to 
set a goal for myself, and then recover 200 griffon feathers, 150 kobold 
champion heads, and 10 dragon scales... and whenever I kill the 
appropriate mobs I automatically receive the item. Or perhaps its a more 
'treasure like item', and when the mission is accomplished the final 
room unlocks, and the treasure is inside...

Its more immersive to me than mistmoore points, guk points, etc.

Its the same thing "really"... but its the difference between the 
ak'anon guides and the SWG floating lines of colour...
