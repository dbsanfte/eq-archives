John

A sensible and well constructed message.  Though we may not agree on
this issue I do applaud the manner in which you undertake your
arguments.

There is a common joke running around most of Europe which could
answer your question: "what viable alternatives can you propose
to taking military action to clear out the terrorists and their
supporters" and this is, of course, to invade Washington DC.

Best wishes
Malc
