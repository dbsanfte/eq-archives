    Hehehe, I never get a chance to play them and I always lose rolls on
twink gear when I see it drop. Like when we went to CT to farm GRC
words/pages, and I lost out on the Fleshgrinder. And the tradeskill market
bombed out almost as soon as it started, because of ornate. It makes me
cringe to see Earthweave Sleeves, which are better than pretty much anything
pre-Vex Thal, selling now for 15 K.

    But I am trying to upgrade the twinks. Last night when proper raiding
ended a bit early, some people went around killing junky Velious mobs. My 42
shaman now has a pair of Vindi boots, and in a really disgusting display of
twinking, my 35 magician has a pair of Boots of Bladecalling. Hey, a mangina
can't have too many pairs of shoes!
