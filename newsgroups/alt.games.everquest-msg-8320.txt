Congratulations :) :)

I had fun last night too... got an escort to Velious, when we went to
S Ro to meet up, the AC literally popped on his head :)  He went LD
whilst showing me the Rygorr fort, though. Another friend was hunting
there and told me to run, as the chief etc. were on a rampage and had
wiped out his party. So, I run. Manage to find the zone to GD, then
manage to find Thurgadin. I love that city already :)
Decided to do faction work in my home town while I still can (I want
Kelethin merchants to consider me warmly :) ) and foraged some
inedible berries in G Fay... Ripened heartfruit :)
