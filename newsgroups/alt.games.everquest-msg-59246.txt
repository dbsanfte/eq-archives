Well I installed XP tonight and following the patches I found that I could not
get intot he game once I chose my char the minutes it went to enter the zone
fromr the char selection screen it reset my PC (.

Still looking to to why, I would hold off I think until an official
announcement prolly SOL before trying it. Not long to wait now )

Hope this helps
