Its reductio ad absurdum.  Points out that EQ favors those
with 24/7 net access already, that bazaar is no different
in that than long camps or the heinous nature of some CRs.

Spot on topic really.

If your daughter says "I want a pony" the response "people
in Hell want ice water" is dead on topic, although it may
take the wee tot a while to figure out why.  Its a parallel,
or allegory or some shiz like dat.

Complaining about some annoying implementation choice is
"bitching".  I make reasoned observations, you complain, he
bitches.  The verb is transitive.
