Agree on that one. Been spending the last week in BB getting from 39 to 45, and
usually at full mana around 4 min before the dwarfs spawn again. So have plenty
of mana to port with, but cant leave a VERY sought after camp. See people shout
for port there around 4 times a hour, but cant leave my camp to port them.
