Was going to say essentially the same thing, particularly given that he 
specified not really doing much with the 3rd account.  Druid would be 
great for the odd buff/DS/port/evac/nuke, and backup healing.  Heck, I'd 
consider using the druid as primary healer once the shaman slows the mob.  
Of course at the current level in question, shaman and druid are 
essentially equivalent healers.
