Alacrity.  Upgrade to Quickness.  115 mana (Q is 80) for "5 minutes 48 
seconds to 11 minutes (Q duration lists as "4.5 to 11 minutes" but my 
guess, and that of posters in the castersrealm forum, is that its 
duration is identicle to Alacrity at any given level) and 34% (L24) to 
40% (L36) haste (compared to Q which capped at 30% at level 20).   So it 
costs 35 more mana, or coincedentally 35% more mana for a 5% boost in 
haste at the low end, 10 better haste at the high end.  With the 
appalling duration of these spells in a melee heavy group I was having 
trouble keeping mana up just using quickness, without clarity I can't 
imagine trying to keep Alacrity on everyone, especially for only 5% more 
haste (2.5% more damage output).  I was really hoping for a duration 
upgrade along with the haste upgrade, guess I'll be continuing to use 
Quickness for a while yet.

Beguile.  Charm upgrade.  I have yet to charm as a chanter, lack of run 
speed, snare, or heals makes me pretty nervous about the idea, as does 
the memory of how charming chanters fared in PON compared to charming 
druids when I was partnering with both as my cleric.  My bard laughs at 
the idea of a chanter charming anyway.

Chaos Flux.  Another in the line of Nukes, my evocation skill sucks, and 
this is 150 damage for 100 mana, not a ratio to write home about, 
although I suppose I should work evoc up so as to have something useful 
to do with my mana in caster heavy groups; unlike haste, breeze lasts 
plenty long.

Illusion Skeleton.  Hopefully this works like Invis to Undead, making me 
non KOS... otherwise, its good for what, pretending to be a necromancer 
in lich form?  I spent most of an hour grouped with two necros (who were 
too low to get this form themselves) in skellie form so I could "fit in" 
with their pets.

Tepid Deeds.  Research only, couldn't buy it or find any of the pages, 
finally a friend with a chanter alt checked her character and found an 
extra copy.  Its a Slow... but mana intensive  (100 mana compared to 50 
mana for Languid Pace)  for " Decrease Attack Speed by 32% (L24) to 50% 
(L60)" compared to "18% (L12) to 30% (L60)".  This looks like a decent 
deal at level 60 (5/3rds the slow for twice the price, well thats not a 
great deal but more slow is a good thing) but I can't find figures for 
the amount of slow at any given level, if LP has already capped out at 
L24 then its at 30% compared to 32%... I didn't observe any real 
difference using one versus the other, except that TD cost twice as much 
to cast, so I'd really like figures on this.  In a fast killing group, 
niether is useful since mobs die too fast to get your mana's worth out 
of the slow.

Enchant Gold.  I don't currently have any of the enchant metal spells, I 
suppose I could buy one and use it for skill ups and then sell the 
product, but I haven't seen anyone suggest that this is a good way to 
make money, most jewelers are chanters who can easily do this for 
themselves.  I have no intention at all of pursuing jewelry myself.

Illusion Earth Elemental.  Includes a 10 str buff.   Ooooh, 10 str.  For 
a melee this wouldn't be worth noticing, for a dress wearing chanter, 
what on earth (so to speak) would I care about my str, especially in 
tiny increments like this?  Does it make me non KOS in the Hole:?  If so 
sign me up!

Invigor.  Didn't even bother buying this one.  Stamina repair is a fools 
game; melee should have stamina over 100 or they should use weapons that 
don't wear them out, and I'm not going to sit around memming and chain 
casting a "quick fix" spell to relieve them of their responsibility.   
My cleric won't do it, my bard won't do it, my shaman won't do it, and 
my  chanter is not about to start.

Major Shielding.  Part of the HP/AC/MR line, fairly long duration, 
stacks with cleric buffs, not a bad deal.

Rune II.   Damage sponge spell.  Uses a component, max damage absorbed 
118 points.  I don't see any use for this spell,  nothing I care about 
hits lightly enough that this is more than a speed bump.  I've seen high 
level runes used  as a sort of patch heal, chained on  a target to 
provide him with constant flow of  damage absorbtion... but that isnt'  
practical for  exp  camping, and at rune II levels, what  do we do 
besides exp camp?

Sagar's Animation.  Sadly, despite someone stating otherwise in another 
thread, this pet doesn't seem to dual weild if given multiple weapons.   
Maybe I did it wrong, gave him two mining picks (fighting in CC) and 
only saw one plus his same old shield animation.  Its nice I don't have 
to find summoned weapons to get him to weild, so now perhaps a gnoll 
hide lariat or velium weapon plan is in order, but by and large still no 
reason to carry rusties around to arm him with that I can see.

Strip Enchantement.  There's little use for Cancel Magic line, is there 
ever one for this one?  Seems like it does the same thing only not on as 
many types of buff.  Is it the favored chanter pull for cheap low aggro 
pulling, like for low level clerics with Cancel?  Seems to me Slow is 
the natural line for that for a chanter.

So there we go, not a real prize winning spell level by my lights, a 
better pet but all levels have that, better HP self buffed, but HP isn't 
a big part of the chanter plan (would be nice if we could buff pet HP)  
Marginally better haste and slow at significantly higher mana cost.  
Perhaps Beguile is the killer ap at this level, if the duration is long 
enough for actual use?

Matte, 27 chanter, Morel Thule
