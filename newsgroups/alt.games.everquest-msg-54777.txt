THe event in Rathe mountains on Morel Thule has been going on for
24 hours now.  I don't care how many zones away you are, you -can-
get there.  As of ten minutes ago it was -still- on.

I'm told that the key is that there is some kind of quest, and when the
quest is completed the zone reverts to its normal spawn.  This apparantly
happened in EK, for example.

SO peridically in /ooc we get people reminding the zone -not- to do the
quest.  SO far so good.

This has to be the best GM event I've ever seen,
not that its fabulous, but that it isn't set up in such a way as to exclude
99% of the people on the server from participating in it.  Mobs range from
25 to 50, drops commesurate with their levels, mobs keep respawning,
fun for all ages.  Even little 10th level guys are having fun dodging mobs
and trying to get to no drop loot that is lying rotting, while level 60's are
busy going after the dragon that repops every half hour or so, or the
big bad red to 59 Archon.
