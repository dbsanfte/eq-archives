Soloing is becoming more possible and enjoyable now with sympathetic some 
updates, like graham my main is 28, but when he was lvl 20 a few months back 
it seemed like soloers hit a brick wall.

My one bug bear is that so many quest require grps and can u find a grp - 
depends what quest, where and time. When you can struggle through solo the 
mobs are often grey which seems annoying> There are certainly more solo 
quest now (and solo mobs/weak grps I think) and I am having the pleasure of 
being spoilt for choice for hunt quest areas.
