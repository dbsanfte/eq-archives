The mistake you are making is in assuming that everyone they have can work
on fixing Luclin.  In reality, people have specialties.  For example, they
almost certainly have people who specialize in doing zone geography.  Those
people were finished with Luclin a long time ago.  Any Luclin fixes won't
need their skills.  It is perfectly reasonable, and doesn't detract from
fixing Luclin, to have those people working on PoP now.

Same for the people that do models.  If Luclin tuning and fixing requires
them to introduce some new mobs, those people might be needed, but
otherwise, PoP is what they should be working on.

Think of it as being an assembly line.  Luclin is now past a lot of the
workers on the line, and so they are on the next thing.
