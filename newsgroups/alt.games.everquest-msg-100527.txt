In XP groups, at 52, my experience is that you are absolutely
right.  

Pets are the strength of a mage, but they are it's achilles heel -
anywhere you can't use a pet, you are just a very weak wizard.

What I really want to see them fix is the situations where I
am unable to use a pet, be it bad pathing (Hate), odd aggro
bugs (DN), or having the 5th strongest pet on a raid (4 pet 
rule).

That and a long recast time atk rating buff to help on raid
level mobs, and I would be pretty happy.
