I recall seeing a long time ago a thread about something like this; as I understood it, someone had
discovered a way to put items in for sale in such a way that they couldn't be easily bought; they'd put the
item in at a very low price and hope to get others to match or beat that price, then run around and snap up
the bargains.

I think it may have had to do with putting more items up for sale then could be purchased, so that the
desired item wouldn't be visible unless you first bought out piles and piles of deliberately overpriced
crap in the first set of bags; if so this wouldn't be possible anymore, since you can now have 8 full bags
of goods available for sale and all are accessible.

But I might be wrong, in which case perhaps someone has revived or rediscovered the method and is using it
to corner the market on blackjacks.  Be still my heart.
