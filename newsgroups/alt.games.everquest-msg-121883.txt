The problem is that you *must* transfer the data to the client, sometime. No
game will be completely server based, at least not for a long time. The
client needs to know where to render that orc, so the server needs to tell
the client where it is in the game world. Maybe someday when it costs $9.99
a month to lease a T1, then maybe things can get a little more secure. The
player pushes the left arrow, the client tells the server "Eep, he wants to
turn left, what now?" and the server replies with "Hoo boy, okay, draw the
wall to his left, and there is an orc in front of him now, and he is still
holding a sword" - at about 15 times a second. This might be possible today
if the server only has to wory about 1 orc, 1 wall, and 1 sword, but that'd
be a pretty boring game. :) Didnt UO try to do this originally? I remember
reading horror stories about how it'd take 15 minutes to open a backpack -
because even the characters inventory was completely kept server side. But
that was when it first went online, I'm not sure how they changed things.

But basically, the client must have a cache of frequently used data. The
server must send that data. Some guy with too much time on their hands will
figure out how to decrypt it.
