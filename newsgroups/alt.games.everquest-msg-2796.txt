AE mez lasts 24 seconds unless broken.  Keep an clock/watch nearby with a
second hand.

Unrest is hell unless you have an experienced guide and puller.  This is
rare, so the zone is hell.

At level 20 you'll get your 2nd AE stun (assuming you have the pages...it's
research only).  Just for the sake of example, let's say you memmed your
first AE stun in slot 1, and your second in slot 2.

Create a hotbutton that says:
/cast 1
/cast 2

Use that hotbutton instead of the individual stun spells.  If 1 is
available, it'll cast that.  If it isn't, it'll cast 2.

This is how you get things under control:
Stun
Stun
Mez
Stun
Stun
Mez
Repeat as often as necessary to put them all to sleep.  IF POSSIBLE, use
single-target mez...your level 16 mez lasts 36 seconds instead of the AE mez
24 seconds.  Doesn't sound like much but it helps a LOT.  AE mez is mostly
for mistakes (bad pulls, bad planning, etc).

ALWAYS HAVE SINGLE TARGE MEZ MEMMED.  Let me reword that:  NO MATTER WHAT,
HAVE SINGLE TARGET MEZ MEMMED.  I don't CARE if you're planning on being in
town the rest of the night...have that sucker memmed.   The one time you
drop it for, say, your AC buff is the time you'll forget to mem it and get
attacked by something blue, white or yellow that you'd normally just laugh
at and stun stun mez to escape.

Staying alive is easier when you get that 2nd stun spell.  At your level
it'll also be easier because at 20 you also get Illusion: Troll with the
added regen effect.

My enchanter is level 51.
