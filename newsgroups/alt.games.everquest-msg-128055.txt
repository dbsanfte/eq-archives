I don't know the exact equation.

Neither does anybody else outside of VI's coding team.  It's
one of the few formulae that don't always _quite_ add up just
when somebody think's they've got it figured out.

Best place to look is the Safehouse, where there are whole
threads both in the general discussion forum (which get refered
to the read-only) and the read-only forum from the old timer
rogues.  Lifers.

Folks who play rogues (as mains) are weird anyways.

> how do rogues get to do 300, 600, or even more when Back Stabing ??

Max BS skill, 13-15 damage piercer, 255 STR, and 3 AA points in
crit skill.

Pop on Duelist and watch Bloodbath hit for 2245...twice.

Watch rogue Evade-or-die...
