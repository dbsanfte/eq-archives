Well, in this specific case if you accept the situation given the math seems
reasonable (although it does assume that the damage is always shared
exactly), and in a constant pull group you do make much more exp than normal
soloing.

There wouldn't actually be quite as much a difference as the math suggests
because that someone always does have to go pull something. The time taken
to do that is the same for both cases which brings the group time closer
(%age wise) to that of the soloist (unless the soloer fights where they find
the mob, in which case the difference decreases even more).

And of course, it ignores the fact that a warrior can't solo much anyway,
and many classes can easily make far more exp solo than grouped - necros can
solo much higher level mobs than most, bards can kite them to death, druids
and wizards can quad-kite, etc. The only way I could make more exp than
quad-kiting blues (assuming no screw ups, of course) would be to be in an AE
group.
