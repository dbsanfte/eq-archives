Most of this I only have an unclear idea of what you are talking about,
but it sounds a KEI addict reponse overall. Forgive me if I'm wrong.

Apart from the blast, blast, blast OOM approach, the other PITA is "Oh
I've got to go and get KEI" - zoom, 1 member down for sometime."

Yes, you are right there, in the groups I've played with so far, crowd
control is hit and miss. I've seen some beautiful crowd control where
people know what to do and do it well, with just the occassional mishap.
Then as a bard, I can use charm(Solon Sirens) as the most effective
means (to me) to pull anything off a caster.

Where crowd control is terrible, I have to use more blunt methods (fear
- Angstlichs Apalling Screech) to get mobs off casters. Yes, it creates
a washback, but sometimes it has been just enough to allow casters &
others to get re-organised. 

I'm still scratching my head over the wonderful sales job fellow bards
have done on bards as crowd control, because I just haven't fathomed it
all out yet. Weak roots, 3 tic charm, etc, don't seem that effective to
me.

I'm coming to believe that there are two types of players; those who
have learnt what to do from playing, being trained or researching it,
and those who haven't a clue (and are probably here for the social
interaction)

"ch" is?

but, yes I would agree with your view that MT is most important to keep
hitting away as usually MT is the biggest hitter anyway and you are
going to get the most out of them for heal points. Often the role of
secondary melee seems to "dance" with a mob until the MT has dispatched
the previous mob.  

But, I think healing people is more important than blasting mobs.
Perhaps this because my view is restricted to the level I've played. It
might be different in 40's+.

I tend to let the song playout, unless it ends.
