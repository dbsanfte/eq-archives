Ok. Lets say, in a space of a minute, we can kill one of your hypothetical
mobs per person in the group.

In one minute with 5 people we get 5 x 232 = 1160xp each.
In one minute with 6 people we get 6 x 200 = 1200xp each.

The example explicitly referenced groups who could not kill all the
critters in their area and were watching mobs just hanging around.
