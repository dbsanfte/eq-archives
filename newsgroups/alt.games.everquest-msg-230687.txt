My Pally has now accumulated 129 adventure points.  I see that at 150 points
some pretty nice armor starts to become available.  All the stuff would
definitely be an upgrade for me but I'm wondering if over 150 there is gonna be
even better stuff that I'll want.  Just wondering what others have been
spending their points on.
