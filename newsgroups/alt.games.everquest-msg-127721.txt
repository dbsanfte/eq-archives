What mobs are you fighting? Hoppers and their ilk aren't considered 
"pickable". You need human-type mobs. Bandits, those little blue guys 
(sha'tok or something like that) are pickable. General rule of thumb is 
if they would have pockets they can be picked. Exception to the rule is 
undead (AFAIK you can't pick ANY undead).
