I logged on right after work, no problems, camped for a few hours, logged
back on, and it downloaded eqmain.dll, after that I had no trouble loggin
in.  I did go LD a short while later, while running across OT.  Logged back
in, aaaaaahhhhhhh, cliff flies by, slam, your have taken 10000 pts of
nonmelee damage, you have lost your level, LOADING...PLEASE WAIT.  Good
thing I'm in a guild with high level clerics, and a high level druid that
brought my corpse to me.
