Why do you think that everyone does not find travelling around in EQ fun?  
The game has most definitely lost a lot of its magic over time as it got 
further and further away from the "vision".  I am certainly not saying it 
was perfect, but, it has lost a lot of it's luster.  Now I mainly play to 
raid, and that is it.  I just do not enjoy what SoE has done to the game.
