Public relations, Give away the razors, but sell the razor blades. I
always con the group, and I don't even let them see me until I know
they are not full, and my level. I watch for a sec. I make them come
to me if they need it. If you don't say please, I ignore the request
or follow it with a "why would I do that?"

I breeze and buff all the time for free. I use it as a way to talk
with them, and if they are jerks I dont want to be in that group
anyway. If not, I ask about grouping. They say no I ask why.

Being chatty is what I want. I want a chatty party that knows what
they are doing or is paying attention. I dont want silence when they
are over pulling a train for the party, or find they are having a
problem like being rooted or worse, find the cleric is eating dinner
and ran out of the room for ketchup while we scream for heals!

If they say no, and they are not full, I leave fast. Maybe a buff or
two. Usually strengthen, which is like ten seconds of medding, often
clar or breeze which is a bit longer to recover. This is nothing as
far as mana is concerned.

Alacrity or Augment are more mana, and I wont do that for four people
unless I an grouped. I won't rune unless I have stones a-plenty or are
in town.
