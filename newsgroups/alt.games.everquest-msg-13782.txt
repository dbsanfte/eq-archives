If I may chime in here?

I think the key point you just statedis the word "bombarded".  The
typical consumer is, as you say, bombarded by all kinds of information
on all kinds of threats.  To the point that the information starts to
become white noise for all the comprehension that occurs.  I'm no
newbie on a computer (been online for over a decade myself) but I
still find computer security more than a bit confusing, if only
because it's hard to figure out fact from fiction.

Discovering the basics of computer security, with all the data that is
out there, can be a more than a little confusing to the beginning
computer user.  And heaven help them if they get ahold of incorrect
basic data.

I'd think that Verant could be a bit more proactive in this area.
Rather than threatening my account with destruction if it becomes
compromised, why don't they have a page on the website with GOOD
security information?  Not the advanced stuff that most users won't
need, but the basic stuff, for the less than fully computer literate.
That would be a better move, IMO.
