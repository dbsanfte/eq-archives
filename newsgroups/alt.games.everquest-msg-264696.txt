I've been toying with the idea of buying the bundle pack and starting up on 
EQ again.  I know that the game is centered around raid-level characters 
these days.  Just about every guild website I checked out requires level 70, 
200+ aa's and a mind numbing time commitment.  I can probably get to my 
mid-50's in a few months soloing and grouping and then find a nice starter 
guild to join.

I decided to take a look at what the last few expansions have to offer (GoD, 
OoW) and can't find any info on them anywhere.  Are there new spells and 
aa's with those expansions?  None of the class sites I checked out seem to 
have been updated since Luclin.  Same with the generic sites like Casters 
Realm.

Are there any EQ fan sites that have been keeping up with new content?
