Easy answer: look at your MR while naked, and look at your MR with your gear
on and no buffs.  If it doesn't move much, this might be something to
consider working on.

That said, you're not likely to encounter mobs where resisting their casts
are _really_ going to matter until your early 20s or even 30s.  At that
point you'll begin to understand how nice it is to NOT have your ass handed
to you every time you stumble across a wizard.

Also, MR isn't the only thing to worry about.  Fire and cold spells are also
often used by casters, with disease and poison less than the other three
(although running into a KoS necromancer will quickly teach you a new
respect for them).
