Hmm. I think your idea is in the right place, but from my experiments, it 
seems that SoTF proc is -extremely- low aggro.  About the same as an arrow 
that missed.  So maybe if you can click that button a few hundred times... 
But it might be easier to have the druid snare, or the chanter tash, or 
the shaman/chanter slow.

The reason wizzies refer to SoTF as their 'aggro stick' is that what 
really makes a difference for wizards quad-kite pulling is having a spell 
to generate any hate at all that's insta-cast.  You don't have to come 
close to a mob to pull, or even stop running, much less stand still for a 
whole 2 seconds while the -other- mobs you pulled are gaining on you...

But I could have a mob on me, that I'd SoTF'ed a hundred times (because 
it's also handy for determining range) and the damn KSing druid could 
-still- take it off me with just one snare.  It's a malo stick, not tash.
