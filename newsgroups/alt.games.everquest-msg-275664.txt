Yay, I won!  I don't know what was up in the previous thread, obviously
I found it again to post but for some reason I didn't see that you had
already announced the fact.  I blame Google's new Groups beta messing
with things.

Anyway, I like May also for the next merge, so put me down for May 15
please.  And I definitely predict that Kane Bayle will be one of the
ones merged.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
