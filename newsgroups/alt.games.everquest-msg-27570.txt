Yes, but it could at least take into account all the coins being
split.  E.g., if you have 2 people, and the loot is 1 plat, 10 gold,
autosplit gives one person 1p5g, and gives the other 5g.  Better would
be to give one person 1p and the other 10g.

Also, I believe it always gives first to the person doing the looting.
If it picked randomly among the people in the split, then over time it
would average out for the members of the group.
