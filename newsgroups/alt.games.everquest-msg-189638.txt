    If you want those things, MAKE an SK.

    note to warriors:

    You chose the best tank in the game and got it. You've been more in
demand in groups, for your entire career, than any other main tank, which up
until recently was four whole classes. You are still more in demand in
raiding guilds than any other melee class, and this shows no likelihood of
changing. The main reason you have trouble holding agro is that you
sacrificed DPS *or* magic for raw tanking ability to BE the best.

    There IS a tank that has all these desirable things: great agro, spells,
soloing, something to do that goes outside the "three buttons" game, etc,
and its called an SK (or pally). Feel free to make one, but you will notice
some downsides - like not being the best tank anymore, like not being the
best at anything anymore. And being yelled at by warriors for daring to use
spells ;)

    I think of it this way: A warrior actually IS the best at something.
They tank better than anyone else. SK's don't do anything better than
anybody else. They're decent at a lot of things, and best at nothing. If you
want to be the best you've got to make sacrifices.

    You might be tempted to say "SKs and pallies are the best at holding
agro". They're the best tank for it perhaps but I must say I have lots of
trouble competing with, say, Wizzies... Yes indeed wizards can't tank worth
a damn and holding agro is a bad idea for them but the whole 'you do one
thing and i do another' is what group tactics are made of - and you wouldn't
have groups if everybody could do everything. Frankly, if taunt was 100%
successful for warriors, we'd be right back to nobody wanting SK's or
Pallies for groups any more. What would we offer that warriors don't do
better? My spells don't grab agro 100% of the time, not by a long shot. It
costs mana and takes serious timing and effort to build up enough agro to
let people nuke, slow or C-Heal. Holding agro AND tanking is one area where
the hybrid (who CAN do two things well, even if neither is the BEST) wins
over the specialist. Remove it and why would a group want a knight? Our
spells aren't the best, our DPS isn't the best, we can't tank the best, and
we couldn't hold agro as well as a warrior - who tanks better as well.

    Wizzies are a good example of another specialist - they're the best
nukers in the game and if I've got my rumours right are second only to mages
for DPS in groups or in raids but if they get beat on for two seconds
they're paste. On the one hand they can solo, on the other guilds care a lot
more about warriors than wizzies, and when was the last time you saw "group
looking for nuker". I've seen it, but 307 times since that rare day I've
seen "looking for healer" or "looking for tank".

    Well apparently Pallys and SKs felt left out; I wasn't there then. My
only complaint was against monks and well that changed...

    I'd guess the groups that refuse warriors are a little rare, and frankly
if there ARE some well that's the risk you take for being a specialist -
there are some places where you might be a wholly innapropriate tool for the
job.

    I find it intesting that pally and sk agro abilities haven't increased
that much (yes there have been improvements but we could ALWAYS out agro a
warrior, no?), and nobody ever complained about them before. Only one class
is complaining about them NOW. What DID go up were our relative abilities to
tank, and shock horror an expansion came out where being a hybrid was
finally seen as a GOOD thing - in a couple of zones with a few kinds of
group. Suddenly Warriors are back to being "One of the tanks", an option,
for groups (still top dog for raids), and are no longer "hands down the best
tank for any tanking group".

    Build a bridge guys.

Cheers,
James
