There are no "acurate" prices to be found. Each server is different
and only with time and experience will you learn the "value" of items
on your server.

An item is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. 6 months
ago a Short Sword of the Yakesha sold for 500-700pp on my server. I
have seen them auctioned for 250pp recently. As more items flood the
market, and new items are discovered (usually soon after an expansion
launch) the market will change.

Your best bet is to spend several hours in your servers auction zone,
and see what things are selling for. Call out for PCs (price checks)
on items you are interested in buying/selling, and see what kinds of
responses you get.
