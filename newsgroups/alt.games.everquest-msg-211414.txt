In my experience, 'it's just a game' is a line used by assholes to excuse
poor behavior.  It's an excuse for saying 'the time and effort you put into
this don't matter to me.'  I've yet to meet anyone who honestly said 'it's
just a game' when they were the target of the jerky action.

I'm in the middle of forming a new guild; one of our first tenets is 'If you
wouldn't do it in your best friend's living room in front of his mother,
don't do it wearing our tag' or fancier words to that effect.  Saying 'it's
just a game' is a cop-out.
