2h has implications that need to be considered.
A lot of rangers still rely on their offhand epic for haste, and 40% haste/2
1h weapons > a nice ratio 2h.
2x 1h also (for 99% of weapons) beats a 2handed weapon hands down on stats,
from HP and AC to resists and focus effects (e.g claw from cursed)

I do consider PB as an alternative to Ambi though (depending on your choice)

Sorry, 9 AA's in a mornings play just isn't happening.

I've done full group elemental sessions, small groups and duos, and solo
"pling" (1 person getting exp with sham/cleric/enc sat outside the group)
enough to know that 99.999% of people won't even come close to achieving
that level of AA's in such a period of time

To be honest, I don't recall seeing any ranger tanks on 2k hitting mobs for
this to be a relevant factor in the decision...  I haven't come across an
elemental mob yet where ripostes cannot be avoided

Agree, but this is a person whos probably under level 10 (as mentioned its a
newly created char), mapping out their first 150 AA's is probably just a
little unrealistic.

Most AE mobs can be attacked from distance, and this is where rangers excel.
For that reason I rate ND/PE lower than I would for say, a monk or rogue.
