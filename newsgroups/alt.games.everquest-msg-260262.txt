The only items you list I consider "un-fun" are the spellbook until 35
(or 50 for the real old-timers), much too much "weather", and the
hybrid exp penalty. 

It was fun and exciting to get new spells/skills/items, and not know
every detail about them. The spoiler sites really sucked the mystery
out of the game. 

You are being a little silly about the gear people had. Getting to
level 10 took a long time back then. Most classes could afford a full
set of cloth, patchwork, or start looting raw-hide in groups by then.
A resourceful player could scrounge up enough coin to buy their spells
with a little hard work.

In a lot of ways EQ is better than ever today, but overall it is much
too easy and lacks a lot of the challenge that made it so much fun at
the begining.
