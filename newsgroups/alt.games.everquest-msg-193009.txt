There is an exception to this, and thats on the FV server with magic items.
If the monster is green, then you wont get any magic drops. They were
intending to make all of luclin like this too at one stage, but backed out
after doing a poll. I think warrens was trivial loot code too at one stage,
not sure if it stil is. Batwings are non-magical anyway, so it doesnt apply.

As for getting batwings, you can buy them cheap from an erudite vendor in
the west end of east commons. There may be one in bazaar too, not sure about
that.
