I had a life, very briefly I had one. I decided it just wasn't worth all the
explanations to my friends when I'd make some remark along the lines of
"Train!!" as our group scittered across the bar to the bathrooms, or the
half hidden snickers when I'd mention it would be so much easier if we could
just succor our way out of the overly crowded bar, and the blank stares when
I tried to correct what their ill bred minds had corrupted the above
statement to mean. And no matter how hard I tried I could not get the awful
drunken images out of my head of finding a perfect paladin to lay hands on
me, or get across the humor of the statement to my embarassed group mates.
I did have hope for them though, they at least knew what I meant when I
stupidly said "lol" at a very lame pickup line an ogre was tossing my way,
sadly he did too and stormed away declaring me evil and cruel. Then it hit
me, I have no choice in the matter anymore, I either give up my job, pack up
my things and move to a city where my attempts at socializing wouldn't be a
complete failure, or I re-activate my subscription....

damn you sony, you've destroyed me for this wretched city where nobody has
even heard of Norrath!!

Now anyone who has actually read this far,  how are the server mergers
working out? I used to play on Torvo and Lanys and am not sure which I'll be
returning too yet, anyone from either of those let me know how it worked
out? Worried about the fantastic player-run setup we had going on with epic
mobs etc on lanys and would hate to return to find the server in a total
state of disarray with flashbacks in time to when no such lists were made
and the arguments and fights that arose from it.
