I've had good luck with just repeatedly charming the same pet every time
charm breaks. Most I will do is maybe snare and/or single DOT the mob I
attack, then immediately retarget my pet for when charm breaks.

I don't worry about the experience bonus the pet takes because when you get
a good one you can sometimes med back up to full mana before charm breaks.
Maybe about 1 in 5 pets will stay charmed long enough and be strong enough
to last. I may even heal them if they seem to be good.
