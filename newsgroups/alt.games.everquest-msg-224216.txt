I've run across a couple of interesting threads recounting and
discussing testing of hate generated by melee.

on TSW
http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&threadid=3789

and on Shadowknight.org
http://forums.shadowknight.org/showthread.php?s=ec5bfff5131e86a6a5292b90604250ca&threadid=18154

It appears that hate generated by melee has little or nothing to do
with whether or not you actually hit the mob, or how much damage you
actually do.  Also, there are references (sadly without links) to a
thread on Graffe's that is supposed to prove that hate does not decay
(any of you Wizards reading this recall that thread well enough to
find and link it?).

It's always fun when you think you understand how something works and
suddenly it appears you may have been almost entirely wrong.  ;)
