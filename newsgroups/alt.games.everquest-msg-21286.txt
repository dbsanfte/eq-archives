Plenty of tradeskills where it's possible to make a profit selling to other
players.  Yes, that happens to be absolutely true.

There are very few trades where you're going to make a LOT of money selling

I've said from the start that if you want to do a tradeskill, cool...just
don't do it in the hopes of getting rich. :)
