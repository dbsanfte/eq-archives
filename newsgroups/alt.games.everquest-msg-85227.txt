Well not everyone has Luclin yet and the Bazaar merchant stuff is not in yet.

You are right though there definitely needs to be a Nexus port in WC. NK is
too remote from the west part of Antonica. I had a newbie dark-elf and had
a bitch of a time getting to the Moon.

I think the Bazaar will be popular when the new stuff is working and if it is
clear and easy to use. I am anxious to see it.
