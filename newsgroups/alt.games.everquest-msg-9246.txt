The poster specified that the other party members were mid 20's.  I can tell you
that the chanters in our groups this weekend, on th rare occasion when we tried
to nail a raider that was getting trained up from the basement, were almost
completely unable to mezz them, nor to get any other spells to stick on them.
Wizzies had the same problem.  I don't think a 25 chanter in the warrior room
trying to handle four raiders is going to have a very long life expectancy.
YMMV.
