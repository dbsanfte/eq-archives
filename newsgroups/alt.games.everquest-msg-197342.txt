Um, there is a warning, it goes with the you have gained a level message.  
And, actually, xp loss and looting requirements are one level apart, one at 
level 10, the other at 11.

If you cannot find someone to help, kill a few things, buy a bone chipped 
rod from a vendor in various places.  It has 3 charges of locate corpse.  
target yourself, while in the zone with the corpse, right click the rod, 
and you will be facing your corpse.  Run that way until you find it.  What 
server are you on, if EMarr, I'd be happy to help, no bard/necro/sk, but, I 
do have a rod handy that I have not needed for a long time now.
