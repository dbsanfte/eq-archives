A little. The price you get for selling a ruined pelt to a merchant is
less than what you would get for selling patchwork armor minus the cost
of pattern. That'll take you to skill(26). And it's a great way to get
your own full set of patchwork at a fairly low level.

You can also just give out free bear hats to everyone, like I did, if you
want to.

Fishing, though, is the only consistently profitable tradeskill.
