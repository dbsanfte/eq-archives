Well, after about six weeks, I still don't know if the game is for me, which
is a definite sign pointing towards no.

The really sad part is, I've had good experiences with playing it:

I've helped newer players than me (usually giving out a little cash and some
pointers) and been helped by veterans.

Socially, everyone I've met thus far has been pretty cool.

On the rare occations when I can group with folks[1], the battles have been
Epic.  Man, I could spin a story about Orc Hill in Greater Faydark...imagine
a fantasy "Saving Private Ryan", with us six as the Rangers and the Orcs as
the Germans, hitting the town at the end.  Great stuff.

See, the thing is, when I don't have people to game with then ... there's
absolutely zero gaming goodness.  Attempting to explore == DEATH.  Example?
I went for a stroll in Lesser Faydark and paid for my curiosity with my
life.  Twice.

"A Renegade Brownie hits you for 75 points of damage!"
"A Renegade Brownie hits you for 51 points of damage!  You have died."

I mean, I zoned in, walked 20 feet and this happened.  This is fun?!?  I pay
someone to do this to me?!

I try to quest, I tried to read up on quests on the web - and maybe it's
just me but the stuff on various websites I've hit seems to be "clan
posturing" type stuff, or constant "That's not a real quest!"  "Yes it is!"
back and forths.  The two I tried (Decaying Skeleton Bones in Greater
Faydark - HELLO, where's the "Cleric's Guild"? Not on any map at eqatlas...
and the Spider Silk quest for the Bard's Guild) came up zero.  One failed
for the noted reason, and nobody in the Bard's Guild mentioned jack to me
about Spider Silk when I hailed them.  Both quests are (allegedly) for any
class/race combo and supposed to be good ones for new players.

All I can think to do at this point is to go from "room" to "room" and hail
*everyone* until *somebody* gives me a quest *shrug*

I apologize if this sounds like an "EQ Sucks!" rant - I absolutely don't
want it to.

I think the problem is that *I* suck at playing EQ.  I'm just looking for
that game defining moment when it all comes together, when I'm *not* killed
by tripping and falling down or a stiff breeze.  *shrug*  Maybe I am
whining, I dunno.

Is it just me?  Do I just not "get it"?

Thanks for listening to me rant, all...
