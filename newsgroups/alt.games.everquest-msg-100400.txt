}Point taken.

Especially since everyone knows exactly where all the druid rings are, and 
hey, there's a druid ring in gfay... first damn thing a newbie woodelf is 
likely to see.

Shame it doesn't work.

Personally, I -still- get lost in BBM on a regular basis, even with a 
map in hand.  I would damn well expect the druid to have said "BBM ok?" or 
the equivalent.  When I'm headed over there I usually ask for a port to 
Faydwer, and take what I can get, but I con Kindly to Zarchoomi and Ally 
to guards.  If one of my dark-race alts was going there and I got ported 
to other-than-agreed-upon, yes, I would be pissed.  If it was my first 
character and I died on the trek, how the hell would I ever find that 
corpse?

I recently started a new alt, a gnomish cleric.  I got to level 14 without 
ever leaving steamfont and ak'anon.  I meet lots of people who never leave 
the newbie zone of their hometown until early teens...  Personally, I 
couldn't stand that life.  My Gnomish main got keeled in both Qeynos Hills 
and Blackburrow at level 5. :)  This is probably Mr. Troll's first foray 
out into the world, and you already expect him to know all the intricacies 
of finding his way through butcher while KoS to practically everything 
(with the possible exception of Zarchoomi and Corflunk. :) )?  You expect 
him to know that the person standing in front of him who claims to be able 
to port to gfay cannot, based on the fact they're wearing leather and 
(possibly) carrying a scimitar?  This is obviously based on his extensive 
experience with all the newbie wizards and druids that come flooding out 
of Grobb and Oggok...

I think he would have done pretty well to have gotten as far as printing 
up a map of where he planned to go (which, note, was -not- BBM) and 
figuring out that he'd need an invis.  I'm still kinda wondering why he 
wanted to go to gfay at all though.  Heading to crushbone to hose his 
indigo brotherhood faction, perhaps?

I must confess I missed the original post.  But based on what I could 
glean from followups, I could not blame Mr. Troll for being pissed.  
Perhaps not very pissed.  But maybe pissed enough to post rant on usenet 
and start a lively debate.
