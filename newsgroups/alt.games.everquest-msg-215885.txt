Reminds me of a chess tournament where, instead of entering the 1600 and
below section, I entered the open section, where I was the lowest rated
player by a few hundred points.  Looking at the ratings, my expected score
for the 6 game tournament was something like 1/4 of a game.

That turned out to be one of the most fun tournaments I ever played in.  I
got one draw against a Master, and against another Master I held my own into
the endgame, where I finally blundered under time pressure (we each had
about 20 seconds to make 10 moves).  That second one was especially fun
because my opponent was a few minutes late, and didn't have time to look me
up on the wall chart.  From my play, he assumed he had played another
Master.  When he asked me my rating after the game for his records, and I
told him 1594, he was rather shocked. :-)  (For those not familiar with
chess ratings, what that meant was that he was supposed to be able to
slaughter me about as effectively as Kasparov would have dealt with him).
