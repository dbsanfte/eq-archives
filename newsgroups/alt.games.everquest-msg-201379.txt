It's not really a tangent, though.   The "camps where a druid/shaman
were pressed" very well might have been trivial with a cleric to
replace either one.   Or they might have been trivial with an
enchanter to replace the shaman.  Or they might have been trivial
with a rogue added to the group.   Or they might have been trivial
with a monk pulling singles.   And so on and so on.

A druid healer could handle pretty much any XP camp in the game
pre-PoP, pre-KEI, pre-ICheals.   They just required a group makeup
that off-set their limited healing capability.   Sure, *some* groups
wouldn't be able to offset those limits in *some* camps.  Just like
*some* groups centered around a cleric wouldn't be able to
offset the lack of porting ability without adding a druid/wizard in
*some* camps.

The only thing the ICHeals did was broaden the range of possible
groups which druids could effectively heal.   And then PoP came
out and put in a lot of camps where druids couldn't heal again,
even with the new heals, unless they tuned their groups.

At any rate, druids *could* handle just about any XP camp in the
game.  They just didn't get the same "ooh, grab the cleric" pickup
groups where makeup would be less critical.  They still don't from
what I've seen.   My cleric simply puts LFG on and gets a group
in minutes, same as always, especially in PoP zones.
