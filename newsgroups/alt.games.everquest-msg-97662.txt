Just for grins - here's something I wrote last week in a similar
thread.  These aren't necessarily 'proper ettiquette and techniques'
but somethings to remember as you go down your chosen path:

==== repost =====

In addition to all the other advice you've received so for, let me
offer a bit more:

1) Keep your Defense skill up past lvl 20.  Lot's O' Clerics(tm) go
into permanent "stand-cast-sit" mode around 20 and never melee again.
While that may be what your group wants, your skills are gonna rot.
When you DO get hit (inevitable every now and again) you're sure going
to wish your defense skill was higher.  

I have a lvl 45 cleric with a defense of around 105.  Sounds low.
*IS* low.  But a lot better then the 80 that it was a couple months
ago.
Each time Defense goes up, my AC rises somewhere from 4 - 15 pts....

So, when mana is good, stand up and bash.  Get hit a bit.  Raise those
melee skills.  If your group squawks, and many will ("sit down and
med/heal, cleric!") just calmly explain that your mana is fine, tell
'em to relax, and let them know that you're working on skills - just
like they are.

2) Spend some amount of time each level working on Offense and weapon
skill as well.   See Above.

3) Remain cool under pressure.
3.5) If you get aggro, don't go running in circles.
Cleric's can take a hit.  

4) Mana good?  Nuke!  We don't have the best nukes in the game
(although our undead nukes are up there...).  Sure, you can only heal
like your group wants, but if you can blast away the mob, the mob is
alive and pounding on your group for a shorter time.  Less hits to
them, less healing necessary for you.

4.5)  Mana good?  Stun!  A non-moving mob isn't damaging your group.
When you 2 or more stuns, practice chain-stunning.  When you're
fighting caster mobs, stun 'em as you see them begin to cast a spell.
Chain stunning is FUN and helpful to your group.

5)  Tough one:  Realize that sometimes you are going to have to make
tough, logical/non-emotional choices about who's going to die.  If you
plan well, and have the right group for the zone you're in, maybe it
won't happen too often.  But you WILL find youself in a situation with
not enough mana to keep everyone alive, but enough to keep the
majority alive (and, since yer the rezzer, you probably want to be one
of those still alive at the end).  Don't automatically save your buddy
or best friend:  Save the folks who have best chance at keeping the
most people in the group alive.  

6) Take pride in your job and role, whatever that role may be.
