It's very much a judgement call to RUN or not.

Ideally the group leader will explain policy if it's unclear ... usually I
am cleric or warrior and I make it clear if it's not.

If I call ZONE you *will* be alone!

I have a hotkey that is all caps and blasts it 5 times in groupsay -evil
grin- .. it gets through even a hasted warriors battle spam

I know on occasion it sounds redundant.. but you have to tell people even
when your pulling right to the zone line to RUN..
..you'd think they could figure out "one bubble of health left, mob is only
half dead and eating my lunch.. should I stay?" .. LOL.
