There's something wierd about it, I was able to drag a corpse from the right
arena/temple ramp with my non-kos ogre mule down to the safe hall with full
spawns without getting agroed, wait for wanderers to move past and drag from
maximum range, dragging a kos (actually anyone other than self) corpse with
a non-kos person doesn't mean automatic agro, just be careful because it can
happen.
