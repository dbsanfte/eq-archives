Sorry to hear that.  Do you use any of the new models?  I switch
to old models and reduce the clipping plane, often to zero, when
I expect lag to be an issue.  (fwiw, those outdoor catwalks you
cross in CoM during a Reaver raid are wonderfully spooky at night
when your clip plane is at zero)

Other than for skills over 100 the only way I know of is to watch
the skill-up messages or extract them from a log file.

You might get by for some time yet by upgrading video card and/or
system RAM.  You don't say what your system has, other than the
CPU, so it's hard to say.  Of course, in six months or so you can
likely get something better than I've got (Athlon XP 1600+, 512MB
DDR, GeForce2 64MB DDR) for less than mine cost.
