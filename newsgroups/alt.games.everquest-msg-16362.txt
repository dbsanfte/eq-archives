There's a complete list at www.allakhazam.com

For the macro's:
You can select yourself and do the lay hands. you can't reselect the same
mob though. I would change that to assisting some party member
Something like this then

/target <yourname>
/doability #
    (where # is equal to the place where you put lay hands under in the
combat/ability screens)
/assist <name of party member>

I don't know if a command for quick selecting a member exists...
