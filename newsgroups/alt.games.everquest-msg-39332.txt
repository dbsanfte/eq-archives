    Wanted to add one more point here: at 60, once I max out my bar, I get
XP for nothing. No mob I kill will increase my XP total. The XP argument is
a major red herring, unless you're saying that I must maximize all time
spent in EQ.

    Stop right there. Can't happen - things change in AD&D, the dungeons are
cleared. The Orc Chief won't come back after he dies - he does in EQ.

    Tell me what the "challenge" was when my monk sat in Warslik's Woods
trying to forage an item for his shackle quests, and how that "challenge"
differs from the same monk beating the snot out of greens in the same zone
camping the Bracer of Scavenging. Allow me to put my guess in: in all of EQ,
the only challenge is time. Do you have the time to get to your goal,
whatever it may be? THAT is the challenge.

    Which are of limited number. What are the two zones on a server that get
the most traffic at their peak time? I bet you get one of the two. One is
whatever zone is used as the primary auction zone on your server, where high
levels come to sell and low levels go to buy. And the second? Temple of
Veeshan, which can easily see 150 people (one raid on each wing) during
peak. There is NO SPACE for all of these high levels to go - the fact that
after you kill a boss mob he doesn't come back for ONE FREAKING WEEK doesn't
help. The zones are set up so time is the limiting factor in accomplishing
goals - but at the end game, it punishes players unduly.

    And Asheron's Call doesn't have half the popularity of EQ. At all.
Doesn't AC also have about 200 levels you can advance through?

    They'd try, for sure - but remember what the XP formula is in EQ. Zone
Modifier times level of mob squared. For a low-50's player killing level 20
mobs would be good - one quarter the XP per kill, but I bet they could roll
the mobs. But for someone that's level 25, say, fighting mobs well below
your usual level is a recipe for SLOW levelling. We're talking
mind-numbingly slow. And given that it wouldn't take many such folks to
clean an entire zone of spawns, you'd still have a large number of folks
that would be forced to go to "level-appropriate" areas.

    Yup. You learn at a low level that the two biggest sources of downtime
in EQ are corpse runs and LFG time.

    Does that matter? Are you saying I should have no choice BUT to cram
myself like a sardine into whatever high-level zones are available if I want
ANY reward from EQ? Seriously - that is the implication of TCC: if you want
your play to reward you in any tangible way whatsoever, you must spend that
play time in one of the few zones we've marked as "appropriate for you".
Sorry, I don't think VI has the brainpower to make those decisions. IF they
did, the only pre-planar INT arms AND WIS legs wouldn't be off one
easily-soloed mob. IF they did, then the best priest-class cloak for many,
many levels wouldn't be ON that green mob. That player in Perma is making a
choice to get an item because he feels it's a more valuable use of his time
than the alternatives available to him. Think what that says about the rest
of the game.

>In Seb and KC

>1k or so the cloak goes for.

    Have you BEEN to these zones? Standard ooc's: "Camp check!"
"Everything." Let's do Velk's: US, UD, LD, SH, BR, LC, RC camped. 42 people,
the spawns are hunted to near-extinction, nothing left up but raid-level
areas. 42 people, zone full. Now Seb: Zone, Chef, Bar/Arm, NJ, NG, Crypt,
Blood/Emperor (and most wouldn't split the Crypt area), DHall, D1, D2, IJ,
King, Juggs/Reets (usually a two group affair). 84 people, and again, I've
packed them in TIGHT with these camp assignments. Karnor's: RC, LC,
DCaptain, RCY, LTower, Hands/Warlord, Basement (two groups). 48 people. Add
it up: 174 people. Out of the 2200 people online at peak, less than 10% can
be in non-raid situations. Even though the pick-up group is the dominant
method of grouping.

    I can set my own agenda. If I want a Mammoth Cloak, I need wait for
nobody to get it - I do it myself. If it's camped, I wait or I go to another
place that has something of interest to me. Under your method, I wait until
some other person makes the value judgement that an item is worth camping.
Mammoth Cloak will hopefully be camped, but what if I want the nearby Etched
Ivory Charm? What are the odds that a level-appropriate person will want to
get such an item, for resale, given how many spawns are swarmed into that
area? Risk vs. reward is hugely out of line for the item, unless risk (it's
all green, I can single the Jailer without adds) is modified.

    Then get in line. It's not like the camp is only available to someone
level 40 and up - if you wait, like the person sitting there had to wait, it
will come open and you will have your shot. Would you complain if the person
was a 35 monk in Fungi, CoF, and dual Jade Maces? HE has no risk either, but
he gets XP. Where's the difference?

>Where is it written that
>only level 40+ can get the phat lewt?

    I have no clue. It seems to be an assumption of the pro-TCC camp that
every loot item worth having in the game is camped by someone 30 levels
above the camp, who needs only to hit the autoattack/pet attack/nuke hotkey
once to claim their prize.

    NO, WE DON'T. Seb - FULL. KC - FULL. Velk's - FULL. Oh well, play a
twink. No other zone has anyone to group with in it, because the other zones
(choose from): (a) aren't near any port points or towns, (b) have no open,
safe zone areas to pull to while waiting for a balanced group to form, (c)
have no named camps, (d) have only tightly-balanced group difficulty
encounters. Not to mention that if someone wants loot on a given day, one of
the worst ways to go get it is to group - you then have only a one in six
shot at something that drops once per two or three hours, as opposed to the
one in one chance if you solo it.

    Not in Upper. They don't want to ruin faction. The AC camp is one of two
camps (three? Skeletal Monk? never been) in all of Upper where they can hunt
and not be forced later to have invis or wade through armies of angry green
Frogloks every time they want to visit Lower Guk. Not to mention that if
they want XP in Upper while waiting to get into what is a solo or pairs
camp, then they're likely of a level where only a few Live Side zone mobs
and Shin Lord will be blue.

>I've hunted Upper Guk myself, when I was the
>appropriate level for it.  It's fun.

    So have I, in two situations: one, solo. Two, with a group I brought
just for that purpose. Neither really opens up the game, does it? (And
situation two happened pre-Kunark, too.)

    Same subset of people want one. A smaller subset of those that could
take the spawn are able to take the spawn. Price goes up.

>Typically what happens if you have many people farming an item that
>many want is that the price *drops* drastically.

    Yet, TCC folks claim the AC is ALREADY farmed 24/7 by high level
characters. Are you saying this ISN'T so, and that's why the price is
holding on Gatorscale?

>Take the Hero Bracer.

    OK. Hero Bracer: item with many alternatives, including Kunark class
armour, that are fairly to very available (depending on server). As game
expands, even more alternatives have been introduced. Wow, and the price is
falling? Can't imagine why.

      Now take Gatorscale: I can think of one readily-available alternative
to the legs (Kromriff Military Leggings), and that takes effort and some
grouping. Arms, no pre-planar alternatives. And it's not dropping in price.

    Prior to Kunark, not only did they have almost no other options insofar
as XP zones in those level ranges, the items that dropped there were worth
MUCH more. Now, with the cash you got selling Bat Wings you can afford a
weapon that drops in one of those zones, and go hunt somewhere safer with
more pick-up folks there. Someone that can get XP off Squire (so a level
22/23 at most person) won't be dropping into UGuk to see if they can group
with five others in AC, knowing that if nobody's there, they've wasted their
time. If they die and aren't an evil race, they've wasted a ton more time.
Nobody wants to waste time, but as Abashi proved in that "what's downtime"
thread, VI has no clue people consider this a waste of time.

    Again, you are missing the point. At 50 plus the game becomes attractive
because more goals can be achieved without having to rely on anyone else
SHARING those goals. I can solo things at that level - not things that give
XP, but things that drop items I want. PEOPLE WANT TO SOLO MORE, NOT LESS.
If an item drops and I'm solo, it's mine.

>You shouldn't have to go through 50 levels of mindlessly dull

    At least we agree on something. ;-)
