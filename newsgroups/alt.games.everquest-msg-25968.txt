When one pours molten metal into a mold, the metal
invariably creeps a bit into the crack in the mold.
Once cooled, and the mold is opened, the resultant
object will have "scales" attached to it (they actually
do look like fish scales, BTW.)    A scaler is the tool
used to remove them before the piece is sanded
smooth.
