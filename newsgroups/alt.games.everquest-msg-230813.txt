The only place that I know of would be in the HoH basements.  You can kite
the suits of armor and they will occationally drop spectral parchments.  You
might also consider buying specs in your server's auction channel.
Generally people are willing to sell Spec MQs for cheaper than many spec
spells sell.  On Brell the Necromancer specs that are necromancer only
spells (darkness, seduction of saryrn, death's silence, etc.) tend to be
priced pretty high and I managed to get some deals buying mqs instead of
spells in the bazaar.  Good Luck!
