The question is CAN they really make more money doing that? It has not 
been proven yet. Keep in mind I'm not saying they are displaying this 
attitude at the moment. Rather I am debating this attitude which Dark 
Tyger and others suggest as appropriate for Verant to take with regards 
to player complaints.

Personally I agree Monks needed a nerf. I also agree that the mod rod 
situation needed addressing. However, I would much rather have preferred 
to see Verant doing it properly by fixing the AC issues for all classes 
instead of simply nerfing Monks. I also don't like the way Verant has 
designed end game content around the use of mod rods etc, then nerf them 
while claiming to "adjust" the end game content. I see this as another 
way they want to restrict the speed that players are levelling and 
acquiring high end loot, so they make these end game encounters only 
just short of impossible. That way the players don't get bored with 
them, so they keep playing and therefore paying. Once the players find a 
way to "win" Verant will come along and nerf them again.

"Oh dear, it looks like the players have won the game again. They must 
be punished".

This nerf has also just shut out yet another class from the high end 
game - Mages. As I play a Mage I am a little disappointed by this. It 
seems to me that Verant continually try to close off the end game to the 
holy trio classes - Warriors, Clerics and Enchanters.

What's the point of creating classes which end up being useless to other 
players? This is supposed to be a social game after all.

The old "vision" of small groups of players getting together and having 
fun has been thrown out the window. The game belongs to the uber guilds now.

Yes its their game, they can do what they like and they don't have to 
listen to the players if they don't want to but I am getting a little 
tired of this nonsense and I don't think I am the only one.

P.S. No you cannot have my stuff.
