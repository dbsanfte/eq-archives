I think the real loss is the result of the 'sophistication of the 
playerbase'.

A lot of the 'fan/spoiler sites' that took years to build and generate a 
following are fully tooled up and raring to go the day EQ2 hits the 
streets. Data acquisition and collation etc will be operating full bore 
from day one, if not earlier. Similiarly this time many of guilds are 
pre-formed and are arriving in EQ2 already well organized. None of this 
puttering around getting to know people... within hours of the game 
going live guilds will be fielding 30+ people in concerted activity, 
finding xp, grinding levels, loot, whatever. Not to mention the leeches 
who target these games to generate $ are already organized ready to find 
and peddle plat or items or whatever else is of value the day the game 
hits the street. 

Simply put: 'the machine' to digest these games exists now, and new 
games are just fed to 'the machine'. When EQ1 first came out, 'the 
machine' still had yet to be built. 

Too bad we can't dismantle 'the machine'.
