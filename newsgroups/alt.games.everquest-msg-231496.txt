 I am sure that many new places exist, but here are some of the old school
platinum places;

20-35 Estate of Unrest
35-45 SolA - you should average about 500pp per hour by selling to the
merchant at the Druid ring.
45-50 Crystle Caverns (Geonoids) You should average 1k per trip at least
providing the Focus and Collector are spawing properly.
45-55 Lower Guk  everything you kill drops 3-5pp
45-55 Karnors Castle excellent loots, good plat, good chance of dying

 Just a few suggestions
