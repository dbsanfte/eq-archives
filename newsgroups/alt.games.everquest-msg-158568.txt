So all 46 - 50 level warriors that are using Lammy's should drop them for
Black Blades of Tormenting?
When they hit 51 they need blood points or they won't be going anywhere?

warrior friends have used the best ratio weapons available to them at the
time and they have had no trouble progressing to Warlord or being MT in
groups and raids.
