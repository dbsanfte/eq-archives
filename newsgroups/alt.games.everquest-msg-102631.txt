The subscription base of EQ is the size of my city (my city is roughly
450,000 or so, 375,000 in the formal city limits)

I live in omaha nebraska.

Every day or so, someone is murdered, a bunch of old people die,
someone commits suicide etc. None of it is related to the fact that we
all live in Omaha NE. It is just life.

Get it?

The population of EQ is like that of such a city. People who play EQ
therefore are going to have children, die, get cancer, get murdered,
murder people and kill themselves. That is life.

When a guy is running down the street in a jogging suit and rapes
someone or when someone is out jogging and kills themself later, you
don't see a story in "Runner's World" magazine about them killing
themself and they were a RUNNER.. OMG A RUNNER! When someone kills
their family and the TV was on being watched you don't read up on it
and how TV is this horrible thing and oh they should give a memorial
to the people in that family on the Letterman show since it happened
to be on at the time. 

THERE IS NO CORRELATION. This is just ANOTHER RECREATIONAL ACTIVITY.
God, I wish people would get over this "we are a small close knit
community." WE ARE NOT. If we are then I'm a close knit community with
the people in my city, although I don't know 99 percent of them and I
sure don't cry when I hear about people dying constantly.
