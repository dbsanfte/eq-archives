"/who all criteria" returns markedly fewer results than it used to, even 
over the last couple months. /who all class 60-65 used to result in 
'this list has been cut off...' pretty much 24x7... now I routinely get 
16 matches or 10 matches (off peak of course... but still). Sure its 
possible more and more people are using the anon option, but I doubt it.

'Measurable profit' is not the criteria. It must meet 'profit 
expectations' and 'relative profit' criteria particularly in a 
fragmented market like mmorpgs. If they think collapsing EQ and giving 
everyone 6 months free in EQ2 will be more profitable, even if they lose 
half the playerbase then that is what they will do.

I am seriously skeptical that EQ has 5 more years. EQ is a game of 
community. Unlike other mmorpgs, if eq falls below a critical mass it 
will be literally unplayable. Grouping is required in EQ... so there 
must be an adequate pool to form groups from. Past a certain gear level 
raiding is required. Again there must be an adequate and considerably 
larger pool to form groups from. Past a certain point in 
raiding...pick-up raids are inadequate...

Sure they can prolong it by merging servers, but a community is not the 
same thing as raw people.

And the 2nd point... once the patches, and expansions stop -- the 
playerbase is going to get bored and leave.

Sure there will be a few diehards who won't leave... but if they pull 
the plug and give them an EQ2 carrot SOE has a good shot of retaining 
them... or enough of them.
