You should pay it now cuz theyre mean. Next Card gave me a card and i used it
to buy something, then it charged me for another month when i only wanted one
month so they illegally charged me for something i didnt order. And then they
sent late fees. Like 20 dollars went to 220 now, and they sent some letter to
me saying that my credit is bad or something and theyre gonna have an outside
collection agency collect what i owe, but im gonna sue them for harassing me,
illegal practices for recharging my credit card, and for runin my credit, (like
that matters anyway, ill just show the bank or loan people the court paper of
when i sue them). theyre mean and try to scam you out of money
