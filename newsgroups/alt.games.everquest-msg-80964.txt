As a 55 necro, I almost NEVER have trouble finding a group, and you
will not always be a manna battery. Learn to control pet, and control
it GOOD. Earn a rep as a necro who KNOWS how to play in a group. I
Dot, Nuke (wimpy nuke but anyway), Gheto emergancy heal,  Gheto
emergancy mez (we DO have a 15 second mez), root.........and play
manna battery.  Oh yea..I solo like a MF also :)

Establish a rep and groups will come.........
