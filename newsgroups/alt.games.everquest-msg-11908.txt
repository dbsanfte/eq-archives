I am looking to start a warrior and wanted some opinions on a race (I am
trying to stay away from evil races such as ogre, iksar, troll, etc).  I
started a Halfling just to mess around with.  I would like something that
will be able to wear plate or crafted armor and would like to know what
weapon skill to work on. I currently gave him a Velium Long Sword (2HS) but
should I stick to 1 HS since he will be able to duel wield soon?  Thanks in
advance!!
