I absolutely and completely disagree. It will take exactly one death at lvl
11 for a new player to realize that his stuff doesn't come back with him
anymore. Please tell me how someone could manage to get to 20 and not
realize that his stuff isn't going to come back with him? New players die
all the time and the lesson will be learned VERY quickly.
