Couple of things - first, mage water pets generate almost no push -
they don't bash or kick.  If you don't give 'em proccing weapons
there is no push.  The other thing is that, while pets don't push
*more* than a melee, they are more tenacious - they immediately move
up and stay engaged with a mob - melee tend not too.

With a water pet and my kitty on the back of a mob, I can hold a mob
perfectly stationary with my BL tanking.
