Speaking of casting time, and assuming Druid Succor spells are the same as
Wizard Evac spells, I noticed something interesting when playing around with 
Lesser Evacutate last night.  Although it has a way longer casting time
than Abscond (which is the self-only inzone evac), like other evacuate
spells, it is ready almost instantly after memorization.  Abscond takes
quite a while to become ready.  I didn't measure it, but LE might actually
be faster for a personal escape than Abscond.

LE uses way more mana, though...Abscond is 100, which is barely noticable.
LE is 150, I think, plus the 300 mana drain on the party applies to the
caster, bringing the total to 450.
