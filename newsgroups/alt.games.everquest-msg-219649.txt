your statement can be classified true or false, depending on how you define
society. do you live in the U.S.? if so, your wealth & lifestyle is already
built upon the backs of millions of starving, poor, uneducated people, with
children who don't get even the most basic of healthcare. this is reality, and
it sucks, but it's still reality. your government helps ensure your continued
decadent lifestyle by making sure you don't have to share your wealth with your
fellow citizens of the planet Earth.

you're already letting the children suffer. teckla was right when she expressed
dismay at saving children in the U.S. at great expense. that expense isn't just
dollars. it's at the expense of other children. in some cases, many of them.
