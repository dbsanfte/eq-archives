Taunting when you are at the top of the aggro list has no effect.
Successfully taunting when you do not have aggro will put you at the
top of the aggro list. Mashing your taunt button when you already have
aggro just means that it won't be available if you need it a few
seconds later.

Incidentally, at 57, you can not successfully taunt a level 66 MOb.
OTOH, a 57 paladin can generate a phenomenal amount of aggro with
failed stuns on the same MOb.

You wouldn't be a troll warrior by any chance, would you?
