IIRC, there was a brief comment on this some time ago in SOE's

developer's corner (was a while back, maybe even as far back as
when it was an actual forum).  Something to the effect of it
being very problematic to have any NPC's zone in the original
game engine, and since pets are NPC's...  I don't recall them
going into any specifics, at a guess it could easily have to
do with names.  The object tags in the game engine are likely
based on (or used as) the display names (i.e. Jabober to you
is Jabober07 to the game engine), and if NPC tags were unique
only in the context of the zone they existed in (which appears
to be, or at least have been, true) there could be problems
spawning an "identical" (including health/buffs/etc) NPC in the
new zone.  Hell, they still have trouble spawning PCs into a
new zone, or the same zone for that matter.  Just a few days
ago Lesser Succor hit just as my character dropped to 0% health
and I respawned at the succor point with 21% health.
