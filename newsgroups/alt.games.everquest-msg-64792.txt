For me it depends on whether it's a 50% or 90(+)% rezz.
With my ranger, now that he's in his mid 40's, I pay 35-40pp for a 50%
and 50-60pp for a 90+%.

I always offer the money straight after I loot my corpse (i.e. after
getting the money from it but before re-equipping anything).  I always
carry around 100pp on me just in case I need a rezz (or two!).

If they cancel the trade, great, if not well they did me a big service
and I dont mind paying for it.  I never /tell them "would you like a
donation?" as I think it's cheesy.

I once died twice in the same day around the Ry'Gorr fort (�$%�#@*
Elites) and the same Vicar rezzed me, and he told me the second one
would be for half price :)

I have had one or two rezzes for free, or in return for a SOW, and or
because a few hours previously I had given a drive-by SOW to someone
who turned out to be the cleric in question's alt.

So, imho the donation depends on a few things as outlined above.  And
also what goes around comes around so a few SOWs / buffs to that 14
warrior might get you a free rezz just when you need it!

Happy Hunting,
