You're missing the point -- as long as, like PvP, it's isolated to
another server, what's the problem?   *Personally* I think PvP
is a major detriment to the game -- the lack of it (in any
meaningful way) is one reason I played EQ (and EQ2.)  But
the fact EQ allowed it on isolated servers doesn't bother me
a bit.

Face it:  you're ignoring plenty of caselaw which leads one to
believe the EULA *can't* be enforced as is.   You DO have
a right to sell items which belong to you.   Whether you can
sell *only* your disks and not the account -- or can sell your
account (complete with characters, plat, items) -- is a major
sticking point for EULA enforcement.   Simply because you
agreed to the EULA which says you can't doesn't mean Sony
can enforce it.

No, that's NOT undeniable.   You're assuming they won't
go after sales outside of their own mechanism.   I don't agree
with that assumption.

> * They've never been able to do much about it in the past.

Right, because they did NOT want to go to court and lose
a battle based on a potentially flawed EULA.

Or they've learned they can't do anything to stop it and the best
thing for the game is to control it and keep it off the primary
servers...
