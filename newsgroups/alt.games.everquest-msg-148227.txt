I think that you are confusing training points with AA points.
You get 5 training points a level
You can only start getting AA points at level 51 (or is it 50 ?)

General wisdom on AA points is not to bother with most of the AA skills
till you are level 60 (as level is king) with the posible exception of
things like run speed.

The docs that you have read may be talking about traning points, but I'm
not sure what there is for a wiz to save up for (never played one). The
only thing that I can think of would be specialise, but I'm sure that
you get that before 30 as a Wiz.

Hth,

Jim
