There really isn't a "guild house" as there seemed to be in the
promos. You can buy a bigger house and share the rent with others but
only the owner gets to use the house vault. Even trustees can't use
the vault.

There can be two merchants online selling per room in the house. Two
rooms means at most four selling, three rooms means at most six
selling.

More rooms means more items can be placed. Each room additional
increases that number. You don't have to place the items in any
specific room, you could place all the items in one room if you
wanted.

Being a part of a guild and having status points means you can buy one
of the houses that also includes status in the purchase and upkeep
prices. Members of guilds of fifteenth level and above can buy a
postoffice and place it in their house. You can place crafting
stations in your house (to purchase them you must be a guild memeber
with enough status in a guild of enough levels) but to be able to
craft pristine items on those stations you must buy them when your
guild is twentyfifth level or greater.

The upkeep status can be reduced by crafted furniture that you place
in your house. Some of the status items can be found on the thread
http://tinyurl.com/8cl6h.

Hope that helps a bit.
