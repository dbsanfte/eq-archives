I'm pretty sure they are intended for the long hoped for bazaar code.
And which bank? Pretty convenient to any of them in the bazaar. If you
enter bazaar from the nexus, you immediately pass one bank on your left.
Then, again on your left, there is the entrance to a long building full
of merchants. The very first one on the right, just next to the door,
holds the satchels. THey are heavy as hell, and only useful for bank
containers, but a damn fine deal and only thirty yards or so from the
bank itself.
