The thing is, Usenet is full of assholes who flame people for little to 
no reason at all. Since this is an unmoderated group, there is no way to 
prevent such things from happening. So either you live with it and get on 
with the non-flaming discussions or you quit reading the group. That's 
about your only choice. The assholes will be assholes no matter what you 
do, they are not going to change. And trying to change them is just going 
to devolve into another flame thread.
