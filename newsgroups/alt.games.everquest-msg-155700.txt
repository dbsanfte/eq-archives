My main is a 50th Warrior and I'm grouped for all of my hunting time.
I play almost exclusively pickup groups and, right now, that means KC.
The group is almost always a full group - if it's not, were /oocing
for that 6th class.

My Cleric is 45th. In DL, you can get by without a full group. Often
I'll camp with three or four others and everything works out just
fine. It seems that 4 or 5 is optimum for a pickup group in DL. But
just as often, it's a 6 player group.

My Enchanter is 35. I've soloed a bit with him, but I perfer groups.
Usually, it's a full group, but I find I've got a lot of flexiblity
when it comes to this character.
