Wow, since using this new email address, I've gotten two spams already.
And I only post in this NG(ie, it's not used for email, etc).

Sidenote, try out www.emailias.com.  It's basically an email forwarding
service, used to track sources of spam.  Like so:

To: <e1-53g1-zpc3-pcsf@emailias.com>
Subject: Network Critical Upgrade
From: "Microsoft Corporation Network Security Department
\(sxbbfsdg-faawsl@advisor.com\) \(Emailias:  REPLY-MASKED\)"
<reply-91599-13a6-labyrinthe=-labyrinthe.fr@emailias.com>

From this, I know they gleaned the address from my NG postings.  You can
also rpely w/o giving your true email addy, if you so desire.

It is also useful in finding out if some company sold your email
address.

Just a little FYI.
