I just had another one last night. Was waiting to meet up with a guild
druid to do the corrupted brownie and seafury for her epic. Had some
time to kill and decided to collect brownie parts to Tiru's baking.
Killed a couple outcasts, and approached the brownie village. (Note: It
was just the two of us. We were the first ones to arrive.)

Famous Last Words:
"That was several levels ago. Don't worry. I'll just bow pull both
brownie guards, tank mezz the first one, and you can cast the first heal
after I get aggro on the second. Ready?"

Sadly, Tiru didnt' even make it out. Gate kept getting interrupted.
