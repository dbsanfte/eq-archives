The higher you get in levels the more you will have to wait before
unloading the nukes. In general you should always assign a MA (Main
Assist). This will the the player (or pet) that is responsible for
holding agro. If not, then the mob will ping pong between group/raid
members, and people are going to get killed (usually nukers and
enchanters). 

In the group you described your Earth pet would be a good choice,
since it can tank longer and chain casts root (guards resist root a
lot, but remember it is a huge taunt). Just keep the pet alive until
the mob is down to 50% health or so, then unload the heavy artillery.
The Enchanter can haste the pet and debuff the mob, and you can damage
shield the pet. The cleric can stun, if mana isn't a problem and
enough mana is maintained for emergency heals.

Yes, you could use a smaller nuke, but they are usually less mana
efficient.

Get used to sitting and nuking at the end of fights. It is a very
important job, so don't feel like you are not contributing. The sooner
the mob dies, the less damage everyone takes and the sooner you can
pull the next. The only difference between knocking off the last 1/4
of the mobs HPs and the first, is whether or not you will get agro
:-P.
