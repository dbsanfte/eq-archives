Well, I refused it when it was offered to me, but someone tried to give me
150pp for a bind.  Admittedly, that is not the norm, but back when I first
got bind, I was selling binds and sows, made enough to buy some spells, made
it faster than I could fighting at the time.  I have long since stopped
accepting payment for binding/buffing, I usually do it if asked, if someone
is annoying, I will refuse, or charge for it.
