}Well - I could file a Rastus v Rastus but I would proberly have to resolve a
}counter Crown v Rastus first, which would proberly bring new meaning to the
}term "Committal Hearing".

Hmm, would that prevent you from participating in the second trial? I'm 
not very up on the Australian judicial system.  And actually, if the 
Crown v. Rastus was merely a question of your sanity, perhaps they could 
be persuaded of the positive benefits of a precedent such as you want 
being set...  It would probably ultimately mean that they'd have to sit 
through a lot fewer mindblowingly stupid trials.

Hmm... maybe you'd have to counter-sue yourself over it, though.
