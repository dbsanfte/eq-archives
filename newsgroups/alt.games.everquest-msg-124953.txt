Next time you initiate a fight with a Mob and it's beating you
senseless and you run for the zone...what is that?

And if you are running- and that Mob gets hung on a tree or rock...do
you wait for it to clear before proceeding with your escape? Or do you
wait patiently for that Mob to get untangled?  

Most likely- the next time you are in that zone- you'll take the same
exit path again to gain the extra distance.

But whatever...it's just a game anyway.
