	Haven't been following the thread (who would?) so you'll have to be
specific.

	Keep in mind that E'ci has a high concentration of Asian players.  As a
result there is NO "off time"; if the Americans aren't online, the Asians are.

|    Hrm? I'd be stunned if you couldn't find an all-you-can-pull area in
|Fungus Grove (to name one example). Between the never-camped bug hive, the
|Fungusbeast camp under the bridge, three Caller quests, and the various
|areas up front (which are admittedly prime AoE targets) there's a ton of
|pulls.

	Not the case on E'ci.  Soloing or duoing level 60's monopolize the place.
Except for the bugs, but no one wants to go there because of the faction
issues, and the Callers, which most people consider too much trouble.

|    Not a good idea. Unless you're willing to go deep in, where the traps
|and what not are, you will bump heads with folks there. It's quite rough for
|an XP zone. Honestly, you'll have better luck outside in Maiden's Eye.

	On E'ci it's one of the few places that isn't overcamped.  Most I've seen
in there is two groups.  FWIW, we were at the "statue room", just past the
fallen pillar, which is where the traps start and where you have to go for a
shot at the quest bits.  We had some fairly nasty pulls but one balanced group
with crowd control can handle it.

	Maiden's Eye gives maybe half the experience of Akheva, and you get to
deal with newbs begging to loot rotting NoDrop items.  (My groups destroy
anything we're not going to use.)

|    Is all you offer to the group pulling? You have no useful buffs, deal
|crap damage, can't tank? Wizards are quite one-dimensional. They offer
|ports/evacs, damage, and snare. That's it. If that damage isn't up to snuff,
|the reason to have a wizard really goes poof.

	Almost all of my buffs are overwritten, and you yourself have denigrated
Ranger damage output and taking.  OTOH, evac ability alone is worth the price
of admission.  How many places in this game can't be done without an evaccer?
(Technically none, if your fighters all have gate potions, I know.  I also
know that I'm one of the few that I know who carries them.)

|    Of course not. You play in slow groups where a melee shaman could keep
|up the kill rate from the sounds of it. But try thinking about it a bit. You
|see no problem with a class (not just wizards here, any damage-dealing
|class) having the exact same damage output at 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57,
|58, and 59? With absolutely no way of upgrading it, period, unlike a melee
|with upgraded weapons/haste or, well, just about any other caster? My class,
|cleric, gets two nuke upgrades during those levels when wizards get none.
|Something's wrong there.

	They are already dealing insane amounts of damage.  Increasing the damage
output of Wizards means turning the knob to 11, or jumping to Ludicrous Speed.

	They suffer from the same problem Necros have -- front-loading.  They had
so much going for them in the 1-50 game that there was really nowhere to go
51+.  So it goes.

|    Or are you somehow implying that casters have favoured status in EQ?
|Care to back that up, or shall we cross it off as class whining?

	Are you putting me on?  Casters can gate; fighters walk home or beg rides
from casters.  Casters can bind at the most convenient points for where they
are fighting; fighters bind a mile away from the action.  Casters kill at a
distance and can always retreat from a fight going bad; fighters have to get
in harm's way to earn experience.  Casters solo mobs four at a time; fighters
aren't supposed to be solo at all.  Almost every casting class in the game has
a role in an AE group; the only fighter found in one will be the one Warrior
needed to pull (and it will be a Warrior, you need the HP).  I can go on if
you like.

	Before the Velious-era raid environment it was taken as received wisdom
that EverQuest was inherently caster-biased by design and impossible to fix.
Changing the system architecture to allow mobs to exceed the 32K cap on hit
points is the only thing that has altered that fact, and that only applies to
the raid-level game.  The standard experience grind portion of the game is
still caster dominated, particularly at the 1-50 level where fighters are not
merely insignificant, but completely irrelevant.  The fact that fighters are
essential for raids is precious little consolation; as you yourself have said
"if you're a melee on a raid, you're an ant".


|I'd say
|something here about "Gosh, I guess the folks at Verant like mathematical
|proofs, too," but that would be rubbing it in.

	Actually they don't like mathematical proofs; Rangers have sent them
plenty.  They don't care for empirical evidence, either.  (Logs of hundreds of
shots with acrylia arrows showing the elemental damage doesn't work -- brushed
off.)

|    You still don't have enough. I posted numbers showing you that the
|disparity is still there.

	For experience groups, we have plenty.  We are not going to get Warrior or
even PAL/SK level HPs, ever, and we know it.

|    <uber attitude (c) Jazz> ROFL, Dennis so powa! Wanna know how I solo in
|Fungus? I nuke a mushroom, then start chain-casting my 54 and 56 nukes while
|tanking it. 

	We fought Bandits.

|No need to self-heal, since they spend all their time casting.
|Finish at two bubs of health, just right for a CH. Tanking Fungus is NOT
|terribly impressive. Come back when you've tanked something that actually
|hits hard, like a Velk's named dog or some of the trash mobs in Ssra, then
|we'll talk about your tanking skills. </uber attitude (c) Jazz>

	Those are hardly the standard fare for experience groups, are they now?
But at level 60, with the appropriate buffs, I'd be willing to try at least.

|>and Gorangas in Maiden's with an ENCHANTER healing, so I'm really not

|like.
|
|    After seeing this list, I'm beginning to understand why your groups have
|lots of downtime.

	We had no downtime in any of these groups related to lack of mana for
healing.  Particularly the Maiden's one, which was one of the few times in
which we did have access to as much as we wanted.  We did have an Unfortunate
Incident when everyone else saw the Goranga Chieftain's flurry message about
five seconds after I died.  I do not think I would have lived had I been a
Warrior with a Cleric healing me.  He dropped the Divine Inspiration though,
so it was worth it.

	(And now that I think of it, in the Seb group with the Druid healing I was
pulling all of D1 and half of D2.  Yes, a group with a Warrior tanking and a
Cleric healing would have gotten all of D2, but if we'd held out for those
classes we'd have pulled nothing, sitting at the zone line.)
