They don't have to be put in order unless you are using "any slot"
augments.  If the item has type 1, type 2,and type 3 slots, you can
add a type 2 augment first, second or last and it won't matter as the
type two augment would have only one slot to fill.  Just beware of the
"any slot" augments and use them last.
