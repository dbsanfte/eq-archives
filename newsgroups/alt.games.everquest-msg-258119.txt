This is 17 not 25.

Of course, not even one of the 17 is actually mentioned on the site 
instead we are presented with:

"Strategies For Improving Your Characters" -- culled from class boards 
(or maybe pearls of wisdom like... get more HP!

"Special Bonus -- Platinum Making Strategies" -- probably a copy of a 
guide he got scammed into buying himself ;)

"Mastering Trade Skills" -- the genious found eqtraders. ctrl-c, ctrl-v

"2000+ item locations" --- must have given up copying allakhazams, 
wonder how far through the dictionary he got. (Hint: Allakhazams lists 
over 1600 items that begin with 'A' :)

"specialized fighting locations" -- culled from several minutes of 
googling 'where does a 54 paladin go...'

"color labeled maps" -- several minutes at eqatlas

"900 top quests" -- probably discovered while compiling his 2000 items 
that half of them were involved in quests and spun that off into a 
separate list. kudos for using excels 'sort' feature.

I'll give you one guess of the calibre of 'hacker' that is involved with 
this poor excuse for a bad scam. (Hint: 'Script kiddie' is being far far 
to generous as to skillz... something around Copy&Paste adept might be 
closer)
