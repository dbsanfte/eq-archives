Just a quick note:

Do NOT use tab to cycle through mobs during an encounter (especially
in small areas).  Tab does not cycle through the encounter mobs, it
cycles through all nearby mobs.  If you tab over nearby non-encounter
mobs and your melee button is down (or people /assisting you are
meleeing), you will engage the new mobs.  If you are getting
mysterious [non-aggro] adds while fighting and no one is using AE,
this might be the culprit.

I have also noticed some weirdness with the melee button staying down after
combat is over when /assisting, this can also cause adds if the MT
uses TAB to find a new encounter.

Best to get used to not using tab for targetting until they fix this.
