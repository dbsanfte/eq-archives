So, you've never heard of recessive genes that singly confer a significant
benefit, but in pairs do not?  Such genes can easily survive in a
population, if the benefit is great enough.

Second...homesexuals are perfectly capable of breeding.  Many do.

Third, you are ignoring the possibility of of a mechanism similar to kin
selection.  During most of human evolutionary history, humans have tended to
live in groups with people that they were related to.  Having people who
aren't breeding can be advantageous to a group.
