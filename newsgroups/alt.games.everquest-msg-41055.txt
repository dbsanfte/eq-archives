Oh, I don't know - I did it solo at 16. The trick is that druids have
harmony - if you go around harmonying all the smugglers hanging about
near Dyllin, you can pull him alone. He was a very close fight at 16,
mind.

Try to do the Qeynos bit first - killing Dyllin wrecks your Qeynos
factions, and if they are low to start with you may find yourself
dipping into KOS with the corrupt guards.
