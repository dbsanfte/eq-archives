Well, the convienant thing about the penis jokes is that you immediately
know who to write off as either an idiot, or envious.  There are better cars
out there, but the drivers of those cars aren't going to make the jokes,
because they know how much of a pleasure such a car can be to drive.

Of course, I drive a pick'em-up, so what do I know?

Auch, I hated Volvo's until very recently, when they acutally got around to
getting car guys to design their new line.

Not to fond of Datsun.  In fact, I still don't like Nissan very much as a
result.  Yes, I know, they're not the same company as they used to be, but
the old companies shadow hangs heavy in the air.
