It seems you needed to be reminded what ZEM actually stands for then:
Zone experience *modifier*.

A *modifier* can be zero. In that case, a zero zem is base. Not zero.
As my post obviously indicated I wasn't aware of (nor did I claim to
be aware of) the exact math - my knowledge of zem comes from relative
comparisons of personal experience, not numerical number crunching. I
don't own SEQ, I don't even know what the numbers are.

I gave you the benefit of the doubt (almost). Was I mistaken?

Except I was posting from the english version of zem, not a math
formula.

Given you were unclear enough to cause confusion and in the event
defend it with a math formula, calling people fools is extreme. Not
everyone is so interested in their character's numbers they work out
their exp gains to the last decimal place, you know.
