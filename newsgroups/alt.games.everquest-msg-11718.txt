	I went through 35th level pre-Kunark, so I don't know where
you'd go in either Kunark or Velious for 35th level.

	I spent 35 alternating between camping the Goblin King (and
surrounding areas) in Sol A and killing Hill Giants in the Rathe
Mountains.

	The Goblin King area is great.  The spawn timer for Sol A is
19 minutes.  I was the puller (Gnome Warrior), and we could do 17 MOBs
in that 19 minute period.  I pulled from the King Room, the Torturer's
area, and several surrounding points.  The XP rocked and we picked up
some nice loot (at least for the time).
