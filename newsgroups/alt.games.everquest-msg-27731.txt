Well, how realistic is the idea that if, IRL, a bunch of casters were 
grouped with a warrior, they wouldn't start getting a little upset when 
he kept taking more than his share?  :)  "Oops, I nuked instead of 
healed.  So sorry."  And, in real life, if you've been fighting all day, 
you've got *lots* of change, so an even split would be fairly easy.
