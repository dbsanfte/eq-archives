IT DOESN'T MATTER!!!!!   Don't ask us what you should be, pick something you
enjoy.  GEEZ.

You'll want a healer (cleric, druid, shaman)
You'll want transportation (druid/wizard)
You'll want a tank (zillions of choices)
You'll want crowd control (enchanter, bard)

If you want to go scientific then the only choices are:

Warrior
Cleric
Enchanter
Wizard
