Before you get started I'm sure there are MANY scenarios that are 
acceptable. The issue is how to avoid the ones that aren't.

This sounds perfectly reasonable. But then your buddy doesn't walk away 
from the transaction with an item so it doesn't even run afoul of my 
don't buy from guildies rule anyhow.

I stipulated earlier that avoiding the external player economy would be 
one of my goals. That precludes selling in the bazaar. Sell it to a 
merchant or dump it for tribute. Its less profitable to be sure, how is 
it really any different from selling spiderling silk at 20pp each...

I cut and pasted to put these two together because they all lead to the 
same general problem with tradeksills. I'll call it guild-flation. ;) 

They all seem reasoable and they all work out ok in the initial case... 
the problem arises when you've been making Bazu or LDoN armour for a 
while, and have pieces of it coming out your ass. Suddenly the smallest 
favour and your happy to get rid of a piece.

But wait... that piece isn't even gone... its still in the guild. If 20 
minutes later the buyer upgrades, what's he going to do with the piece? 
Can he turn around and sell it for a favour too?

Very very rapidly the guild is going to fill up with tradeskill gear at 
all levels, and up and coming players will invariably inherit it as they 
come of age with far less effort than completing solro or hunting rygorr 
etc. The guild bank will be full of the stuff... why are they going to 
go hunt for anything level appropriate when level appropriate stuff is 
bursting the guild bank at the seams?? 

And that's just the tradeskill stuff what about non-tradeskill 
stuff...why should the tradeskillers be allowed to distribute their junk 
when someone outgrowing their set of Kylong or Ry'gorr can't?

Ultimately handing out gear, once made, undermines the get 'get gear on 
your own', regardless of whether its tradeskilled or found.

This is what i'd propose:

1) Items cannot be handed down. Period. This *includes* tradeskilled 
items. Sell it to a merchant and be done with the temptation. The only 
exception would be consumables.

2) Tradeskill items *can* however be commissioned provided the character 
who commissions the item finds/funds all the components themself. And is 
of a suitable level. Per some trivial related formula.

I'm not clear on this... is the ranger part of the guild? If he is, then 
see above. If he's not then its the same as selling the Ykesha in the 
bazaar and buying the focus item in the bazaar.

Either way, Ykesha's are good pet weapons. :p

Lol. That ones easy too. You can get them from the enchanter. The only 
question that -might- come up is whether you should need to be at least 
the same level as the enchanter spell.

If there's no enchanter in guild or online regularly enough; I'd even 
allow these to be bought in the bazaar. Rolling up an alt should never 
be a requirement. And there is no other way to get these.

Heh. I could live with that. As long as the farmer isn't walking away 
with anything more than he woul have gotten from a vendor its good by 
me. (Hell you can even pay him a little extra to compensate him for his 
trouble of carrying it and storing it farther and longer than he might 
have had to otherwise.

In theory sure. In practice... hard to say. How do you determine that 
you've "invested the effort". And weren't you already rewarded for 
putting in that effort *in a different way*? Why should you be rewarded 
twice for the same effort?

Suppose you you've killed the PH for the IBC mob 4 times and decide to 
just help yourself to an equivalent Tradeskilled item from the guild 
bank because you've put in the effort... doesn't that undermine the 
point. The point was to ACTUALLY loot the items, not just kill a few 
mobs somewhere and then take equivalent items from a stockpile.

Sure. You can do anything but give them stuff. You make it sound like 
theres only one thing you can do... I'm suggesting there's only one 
thing you can't do. ;)

Between players of equal power who play equally much etc.. generally 
not. Between players of different levels the lower level player 
generally gains easy access to stuff they couldn't otherwise touch. It 
almost inevitably becomes more efficient for the lower level player to 
use that access than to play the game any other way.

Worse than that, they are so badly thought out that they were literally 
designed to provide that end run. They should have level restricted the 
results for one thing. It should be attuneable for another (I remember 
when suits of banded got handed down through generations of 
characters... it was cool in its own right... but very frustrating for 
tradeskillers that there was a FLOOD of banded in the market as none of 
it ever LEFT the market... and this of coruse was compounded by the fact 
that up and coming smiths were also making it and just dumping it far 
below cost to get skill ups. 

I think the skill up path should be separate from the good equipment 
path. Sort of like practice reasearch... practice research SHOULD be the 
best way to get skill ups (and might be in this guild) because it 
doesn't generate a flood of extra spells into the market. The spells can 
be rare and valuable, even as hundreds of robe-wearers grind out 
practice rune after practice rune to generate skill ups.

Similiarly, smiths should have to farm and get most of their skill ups 
on items nobody wants. (To prevent market flooding). And then somebody 
can come to them with a rare drop off a nasty monster and say make me a 
sword of uberness out of this... I'll pay you well. But that game 
doesn't exist yet... :)

In EQ: Sadly Yes.
