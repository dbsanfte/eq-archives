Aside from that one run through here and the DAoC group (and, from what I've
heard, the AC group) by "Ron Jeremy" and his page-eighted alternate self,
I've not heard anyone talking about Neocron.  Supposedly, it's out: both
Gamestop and Amazon list it as for sale, with no "coming soon" notation.
Anyone heard anything?

Amazon doesn't list a sales rank for Neocron, though, so maybe it is not
really out?

On the other hand, they do list sales ranks for EQ2 and SWG, from preorders,
so you'd think there's be *something* for Neocron.

For amusement, here are the sales ranks of various games I looked at while
browsing at Amazon:

1618    EQ2
 191    PoP collectors edition
 145    PoP regular edition
 591    EQ Gold
 985    EQ Trilogy
 425    EQ SoL
 641    EQ SoV
1700    EQ RoK
  66    Neverwinter Nights
  14    Warcraft III
  96    Morrowind
1086    Dungeon Siege
 231    Asheron's Call
 428    Asheron's Call expansion pack
 140    Asheron's Call 2
 228    DAoC
  17    Shrouded Isles (DAoC expansion)
 412    SWG
 450    Earth & Beyond
2293    AO
1082    AO special edition
 455    AO booster pack
1093    UO Renaissance
 693    UO: Lord Blackthorn's Revenge
 976    UO: Lord Blackthorn's Revenge with Todd McFarlane Action Figure
  49    Battlefield: 1942
 111    Planescape: Torment

Looks like EQ, AC, and DAoC are all still bringing in the new players, and
getting the old players to buy expansions, which is a healthy sign for all
of them.  Looks like AO isn't so hot with new sales, but the existing
players will buy expansions.  The SWG preorders have to make Sony and Lucas
happy...they are outselling E&B, for example.

BTW, I'm not sure what the sales ranks mean.  I assume they are just for the
games category, rather than for all of Amazon.  There are some oddities,
though.  For example, in the video games section, there is a "top sellers"
list.  The #1 item there does indeed have a sales rank of #1.  Same for the
#2 item.  However, as you go down the list, the position on the list no
longer matches the sales rank.

Anyway, I'm curious if anyone has actually tried Neocron yet.  Some of the
screenshots were nice...but I'm just not interested in trying it.  I'll
stick with EQ and DAoC (Shrouded Isles looks nice...nice new graphics, and
some very interesting new pet classes).
