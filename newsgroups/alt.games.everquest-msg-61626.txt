Which is -so- sad, because it would NOT be hard to code them into a lot of 
the quests.  I wish that languages were a little harder to learn ( maybe 
not as hard as on FV, though ) and had a bigger impact on the game.

The quests that require you to "Read" scrolls in Gnoll or something could 
make you repeat what they say to an NPC in Gnoll to let you continue with 
the quest.

As for taking 20 minutes to master, crank that INT up and you can master in 
a lot less time than that.
