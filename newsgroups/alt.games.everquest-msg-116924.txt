Well, I'm one of those shamans, and have to agree. I have not met 
many others in game. There sure are an awful lot of WTB requests 
in the market channel for shaman gear, though.

Locale has a lot to do with it I think. Some have mentioned beastlord
as a scarce class. I play a Vah Shir, and grew up surrounded by 
beastlords. Wizard, rogue, and necro(!) seem scarce to me. 
Warrior and druid have to be the two most popular, far and 
away, but I think that's the case on most servers.
