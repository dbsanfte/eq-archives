Well, it depends on what you mean by what you want to "cure"...

If the trap has triggered - it will be a poison, disease or curse. You
can probably figure it out from the icon. The nastiest trap seems to be
poison-based, so I always mem Antidote (as a cleric) before somebody opens
a trapped container, if I have any warning. The others I can figure out
later (and heal people up while hitting everybody with Antidote or
whatever) since only the Poison trap is bad enough to wipe my party if
I have no warning.

Most poison DoTs leave a "poison bottle" icon, diseases leave an orange
hand, curses leave a sort of white-on-black star/cross icon. Your party
probably has somebody to cure disease or poison, curse cures tend to be
rarer since pre-LDoN the cure spells were available only from two camps
both with poor drop rates. (Or, for RGC, a pretty tough MOB in a tough
zone.) So you prbably want some sort of curse cure spell, though you can
probably manage with a lower-level cure. The drunk/lousy-stat curse is
the only one I've seen so far, though it *is* pretty nasty. A single cast
of the level 39 Remove Curse cured it.

If you want to know *how* to open them up, start with the trap detection
spell, then your trap destruction spell to destroy any trap, then your
lock destruction spell to destroy the lock. The detection spell will also
tell you whether your other 2 spells will work. :-)

However, personally I've seen very few worthwhile items in trapped
containers - a few augs and gems, but generally it doesn't even cost what
you spent to open it, and "don't touch" is probably a good rule. And if
the "drunk+curse" trap triggers, you won't be doing much useful for the
next ten minutes or so, an amount of time which can easily cost the
adventure.

Yes, the domain is sad, but effective. :-)
