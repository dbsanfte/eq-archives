When an eq friendship elevates to regular ooc conversation...It just 
feels odd saying 'Hey whats the score on the Wings - Senators game, 
Dread Lord Methlegoth??'  At that point its not my character talking to 
yours... its me talking to you... if we're at the stage where we're 
friends hanging out and chatting about RL then I think its time to leave 
the toons behind... at least if I'm ever going to become 'friends' with 
D.L.M.

I may have misspoke. I meant uncomfortable/unwilling to disclosing their 
real identity in EQ. Not some sort of self-esteem issue.

I have yet to see a *really* good flame war since lurking in this ng. At 
worst some misplaced sarcasm. :p

Since it seemed odd to argue for less anonymity while sitting behind an 
alias...For what its worth, my name is Dave. 42 is a reference to the 
Adams  novels, and coincidently is an easy cypher for my initials. I use 
the alias here because I don't really want it to be an utterly trivial 
exercise to extract my usenet history from google, via my name & email. :|
