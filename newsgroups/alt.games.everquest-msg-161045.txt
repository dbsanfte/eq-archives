It's very possible actually. It doesn't even require that much PC 
either. I (err, my cousin's uncle's girlfriend's mother's friend) does 
that on a P2 450 with 640mb ram and geforce2 mx200 card. You want lots 
of ram though, preferrably even more than the 640mb but it works. You 
gotta stack the windows on top of eachother so you only see one at a 
time though. Eqw has a key comination you can configure that swaps 
between windows so you can do it quickly.
