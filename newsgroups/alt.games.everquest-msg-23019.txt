The trick is to find the right chanters, do a /who ENCHANTER, and see
what chanters between 12-18 there is in the zone.
If they are untwinked, they will probably help you.
I personally pay my chanters 2pp pr cast, so they can make 80pp in around
1 hour if i get them a clarity. They even come back and ask me if i need
more, so they can make some more money.

But dont expect a level 30 chanter to be spending a hour making vials for
you.
