I'm with Jackal but /agree Biz Jerry is a pimp!!!!!
And as a Brit in America I know both sides of the story. The fact is that
most Americans tell me they would love to go to England. Probly because they
saw me come over here and get women really easily with my accent and figured
they could do the same?

Or would it be the peaceful countryside, the friendly pubs and the fish and
chips and awesome clubs? Sure sure we have alot of rain and alot of ugly
birds but both countries have advantages and disadvantages!
