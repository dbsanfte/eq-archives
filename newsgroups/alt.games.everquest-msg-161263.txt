Eric

I have the exact same laptop and run EQ with PoP and no serious problems
(movement's a bit jerky in some Luclin zones). Given the GeForce2Go's
limited memory I set my graphic options to use less memory. I play with all
the old models except for Ogres and Trolls, medium quality textures and so
on. I can't say that this is your problem but next time you boot into EQ try
going to Options and setting things up to use less video ram and see if that
changes anything.
