Look from the absolute casual player standpont, my personal CoV faction
improved as my Coldain faction improved.

When  my Coldain faction hit Ally, I became dubous to Dragons.  When My Coldain
faction was Amiable, I was threatening to Dragons.

For months I was stuck unable to improve either faction, regardless the number
of  Giants I killed  from the EW side to the Bank.  When I   moved over to the
WL  side entrance to KD, and just tagged Gients there, with the permission of
the higher ranking folk, My faction WITH Coldain AND CoV  moved to Ally AND
Dubous  at the same time.

So guys. Sorry. From my experiences stated above there IS a correlation.  You
may not like it, It may not have happened to you, but for me there was.
