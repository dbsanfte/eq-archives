Well I can give a little feedback here. (but not much) I have a few items
that I have made money on that way.  I like to stick to what I know.  Be
careful buying an item just because others are listing it at a higher price.
Just because someone has priced it higher does not mean that it's worth
that.  Also, check prices often.  I just made a big mistake last night. I
paid 300pp for an item that I thought was worth about 1k.  When I looked
there were several listed at 75-150pp.  I just bought this item for my
character about 6-8 weeks ago and all were priced between 750-1.5k at that
time.  Things can change very quickly.

There are thousands and thousands of items and it's literally impossible to
know the aprx value of all of them at any given time.  What I have done is
learned of a few items that sell well and that have stabilized at a certain
price range.  When I find them at a steep discount I buy them and then
resell them.  Sometimes they fly out of my inventory and sometimes the move
very slowly. Don't try to make money this way unless you can live without
the money for a while and you don't mind spending a lot of time in the
bazaar.
