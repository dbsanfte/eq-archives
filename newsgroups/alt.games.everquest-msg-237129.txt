Single pulling in the Purifying plant is pretty easy.  Rarely will
you need a pacify (a single pacify).  Many times it's simply  a matter
of letting roamers move off.

Double pulls aren't too tough if you get the add slowed quickly enough.
Now, if anyone can tell me how to click target those damn gnats.
(Usually I target the potential add first, then assist the MT on inc -
that way I can CTRL+T to the add if pac is resisted).
