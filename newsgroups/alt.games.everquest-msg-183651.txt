I appreciate the input, and it apperars that DaveE snipped the part I
quote below:

"When casting I notice that only the Shoulder item reacts, so I remove
shoulders in attempt to watch my new range item do its things..."

I removed the lower item to see the new one work... the new one is a
level 4 focus item... but my necro is only 26.  is there any minimum
requirements etc?
