   That's nothing.  When I fart, the force of it lifts me over 9
feet into the air.  Knocked myself unconscious on the ceiling four
times last week.
    Now, back to Everquest, not this nonsense about our farting
super-powers.
    I think trolls and ogres should get as special ability, Toxic
Fart.  An area effect spell, this would cause dizziness and damage
over time on anyone caught in it grasp, be they party member or
foe.
