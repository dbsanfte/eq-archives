At least there was a character to restore the armor *to*.
*smirk

The current bug de'jour on Test affects entire characters disappearing
from the character select screen. Suspicions are that it happens if you
are on the character select screen with that character highlighted when
the server crashes, but I've not seen it confirmed. It thus far has
claimed two level sixtyfive characters. Last I checked in, the owners
were waiting for folks to get back from Holiday to get an answer on it.

Ouch.

Let's hope *that* one doesn't make it over to production. he he.

/crosses fingers and peeks at his character select screen again.
