I'm getting to the stage now where I am starting to look at upgrading a few
bits of armour and getting a new weapon.  I have a mid 30's warrior and up
until now have not paid too much attention to what  I am wearing, most stuff
is the same as I was wearing in my teens, eg. orc fang earrings, bronze
armour, silvery war axe.

I could probably scrape together 6kpp or 7kpp and would appreciate any input
into what to buy in terms of armour and weapons (1hs or 1hb are my best
skills).  I have heard that AC is the primary stat to concentrate on but I'm
also looking to increase my strength.

Thank you for your time,
