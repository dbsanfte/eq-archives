I've had that wavering effect, too, although mine was the opposite; when I
updated my video drivers before the patch, I had that wavering effect of
patches of ground in BBM, GD, Oggok, and several other places. That was when
I had my Radeon 7000 PCI installed. Since switching to my Geforce2 AGP, I've
not noticed the shimmering ground any more.

I'm upgrading to a new video card today, I'm hoping this will fix the
crashes/disconnects from the rain that I've been getting too (died last
night as a result of one of these rain crashes, losing my kei and pot9,
which irritated me...did another /bug and this time a /petition, may get the
xp back according to the guide who eventually responded, no idea if I
actually will or not though).
