Yes, please do! :-)  No, I'm not being sarcastic. Ok. You've identified,
as other have, how a necro or SK on a raid in a high end zone could take
the place of a monk for pulling and CR work if you don't have a monk.
(Ok, in your examples, he might even be *better* than the monk.) But
it's not like you can't do those raids with monks, right? I mean, do you
raid one of these areas and say, "Oh fuck. The SK with the pre-nerf CoS
didn't show up. Everybody go home."  So basically, for the "average
player" and even some higher end players, it sounds like this is a VERY
situational item that's not *needed* that much, and sounds like zero
help for one of those two classes that are soloing or grindin xp in a
group. Can you give me other examples? (Please note, I'm not arguing
*against* having one. Just that this came up on our group, and I'm
shocked at the cost of these things, and how highly the necro and SK
community seem to regard them, and frankly I still can't see what makes
them so damned expensive beyond the novelty of having a "pre-nerf" one.)

I'll definitely give you "handy" but I certainly wouldn't call it even
necessary, say nothing of "powerful" unless it's in the extremely
specific high-end raid puller situation you describe above.

Ok. I'll grant you that. But I'm generally not running around solo in
Hate, Fear, or ToV. ;-)  (Ok, Hate, but that was just once. Long story.)

You sold an item for .... *choke*... 600 THOUSAND PLAT?  Ok. I dont'
know what the hell a gold inlaid ulak is, but I'm guessing it's a hell
of a lot nicer than something with a right click invis. he he.
