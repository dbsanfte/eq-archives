That was true of every expansion. You couldn't take non-velious players 
to velious, or non-kunark players to kunark... so ldon is not different 
in that respect.

Yeah, group oriented content that applies to only 3 of the 5 possible 
group sizes. Its absurd that they had a more restrictive definition of 
groups than was implied by the game itself, I'm damn sure when I invite 
one other person EQ calls it a group.

Still at least it wasn't a 'raid oriented' expansion. Can you imagine 
the rants if 'raids' of 18 people (since that is what SoE has defined as 
a raid, not 17, not 16... ) were required to go into the expansion. Then 
again I'm a little irate that I won't see big parts of PoP because I've 
got 'better things to do than suck up to a raid guild'.

Plus the ranting about pickup raids would be ceaseless too :)
