Depends on your level. At lower levels, points of WIS translate into
relatively small amounts of Mana, and so the Skull makes more sense.
However, as your level increases, WIS translates into higher Mana, and
so the Testament works out to a better benefit overall.

I always kind of used level 20 as the rule-of-thumb position where WIS
begins to make more sense than Mana. However, that may well be wrong.
I'd recommend you find one of the mana calculator formulas or web
sites (most of the major sites have one) and plug the numbers in to
see where the greatest benefit is for your level.
