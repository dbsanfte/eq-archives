I see your follow up where you mention ISP problems.

But I had a problem this evening with connecting, just loaded and
patched, first time playing.

Couldn't get the browser to go active so I could create a station
account. I had to kill the Everquest program by stopping the task in
Win98se, then create and setup my station account. Exit from that,
then restart everquest, then log into Everquest.

Couldn't find a gamma setting, so my half-elf character was in the
dark. So I exited after the tutorial finished and deleted the
character.
