I've heard of this, but, well, this is Firiona Vie.  Only one character 
slot per account, and I'm not gonna pay SOE double just to become a Shar 
Vahl citizen.  ;)  I'm pretty content as an accepted resident; even 
gotten a bit of attention from a couple of Vah Shir PCs.  And 
Shadeweaver's Thicket is pretty damn uncrowded on FV that a lot of time 
I can farm the Xakra larvae for silk without taking the spawns away from 
the kittens.  :)

I love Shadeweaver's, by the way.  Merchants, bank, trainers, POK book, 
lots of quests (just got the blessed champion's cape, woo!)... oh, and 
swirling shadows.  YUM.  Swirling shadows + Bazaar = One happy lowbie Iksar.

*nod*  I actually started off with a Vah Shir beastlord when I came back 
to EQ, so I've done the citizenship quests.  Good stuff; I was 
impressed.  I just like Iksar more, though, in the end, and the scaled 
wolves are waycool.  :)
