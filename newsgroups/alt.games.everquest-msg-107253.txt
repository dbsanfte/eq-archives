This should be posted to the Dev boards. It would actually be in VI's
best interest, just in PR terms if nothing else. Honesty, in this case,
would certainly be the best policy, as EQ players (ok, the regular ones,

have a few that research shit to the n'th degree and would find it and
make it public.
