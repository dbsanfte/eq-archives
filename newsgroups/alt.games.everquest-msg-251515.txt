I used to regularly get stuck at an exit onto a highway in Georgia, with 
traffic lockstepped in line heading to the onramp to an interstate. 
Literally spent as long as 30 minutes stuck there unable to move, 
because the drivers saw it as their bounden duty to prevent me "cutting" 
in on them, inconveniencing themselves (and perhaps thinking of the 
inconvienience to the thousands behind them) a few seconds worth.

I've certainly been in situations that work more like you suggest, where 
there will be a gap randomly occurring every couple minutes... but when 
you brought up the situation, I flashed back to my worst memory of such 
an occaision.  I was amazed that hundreds upon hundreds of people could 
all agree, without discussing it between themselves, that under no 
circumstances were they going to let a car get in their lane!

It was like the behaviour of geese and other formation flying birds and 
fish, where independantly following a limited set of rules creates 
remarkably patterned behavior that would make you think there was a 
unifying strategic thought process at work.  But we all know Georgians 
in morning rush hour do not exhibit cohesive thought at any level!

I say regularly, but it only happened to me about 4 times; the first 
couple times it didn't occur to me it was a pattern, the other two were 
widely seperated and resulted from my misjudging what "rush hour" times 
were, because I rapidly concluded that it was worth driving ten minutes 
out of my way to avoid that particular sticking point.

Contrasting this, there's a highway in Arizona (Superstition Freeway) 
which has some very heavy traffic flows during peak hours.  The on ramps 
joining this highway were, as in many places around the country, fairly 
difficult to negotiate during those hours, and ended up jam packed and 
backed up onto the cross streets, and the freeway had a great many slow 
downs around each of the merge lanes.  Last year they introduced 
something new; a stop light about halfway down the on ramp.  This light 
blinks red and green, and there's a sign explaining that only one car is 
permitted to go per green.  Each car gets to get up to speed on the 
second half the on ramp, and merges into the moving traffic by fitting 
into any gap or because someone slows down enough to create a gap... by 
the time the next car comes speeding down the ramp the first car and all 
the cars involved in letting him in are long gone, despite the fact that 
the light blinks at about two second intervals.

What was happening was that when faced with a big line of people wanting 
to merge, the people on the highway were closing up ranks and preventing 
them getting in, because that would end up with dozens of people pulling 
on in front of them, and that the different skills, accellerations and 
so forth of the drivers on the ramp were also creating miniature jams on 
the ramp, so that the ramp people weren't moving at highway speed when 
they got to the merge.

Basically, the state created a way to make it simpler for people to let 
people in... and oddly the result was not only that more people got in, 
but the people already on the highway got where they were going faster 
too, because they don't run into those slowdowns at the merge lanes.

Funny old world, ain't it?
