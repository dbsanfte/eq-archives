Using pre-patch figures:

At 51 I needed 16,422,120  xp points to fill the bar it should take
the same amount of xp to fill one AA point. All xp penalties and
bonuses apply based at "current:" level. Since 55 was a 4,938,240
level that would explain why I see more movement in xp bar at that
level vs AA. 

Since what they did was modify the amount of xp a mobs gives based on
current level to "Smooth" out hell levels. I wonder if this has had an
effect on AA points. Quick example:

Mob A at 54 gives 100,000 xp points base, plus 30,000 xp point bonus
to ease the hell level effect via the patch. Mob A gives at 55 the
same base 100,000 xp MINUS 30,000 due to same patch since 55 was a
quick level before. So same mob different xp and  hence different
AA-xp awarded but the same AA 16,422,120pt requirement.

So did verant foul us up again? Cause it looks like the best pl;ace to
get AA points is in the old hell levels. Need show eq to verify.

Anyone know for sure?
