If you think that's bad, my mind just conjured up the theme song of a
silly show I watched one summer when I was 7 or so. Setting: town that
was flooded because someone had gone on vacation and not closed off a
tap. Main character: guy who liked to sit and dip his feet in water,
named Daniel Dipshoe. He and an oversized sentient vegetable (white,
carroty thing, "pastinakk" in Norwegian) proceeded sail around the
world in a tiny boat.

Did I mention the theme song was so extremely silly that my brothers
and I were making derisive mock versions of it even then?
