This one?	GeForce4 Ti4200 128MB DDR w/TV-out DVI-I

Couldn't find anything in the description of the 333 that indicated
this; all it said was: PC2100/PC1600 non-ECC DDR DRAM memory.  Based
on that, I figured the 2100 was the way to go.

Supplier has the A7N266-VM with A/V/L, NVIDIA nForce 220-D.  Problem
is that it's only 2 DIMM sockets, 1 AGP (1.5V) and 3 PCI.  Not a lot
of room for expansion.  Upside is no audio card, no LAN card.  Doesn't
indicate what max speed it'll run the CPU at.

Nearest I could find was the KR7A-133R (VIA KT266A 1xAGP/6xPCI),
w/RAID.  $180 Cdn  I'll keep looking.
