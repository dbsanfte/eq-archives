Mages are excellent soloers, summoning powerful elementals and
wielding strong DD spells, but they are slow to get started, spending
time medding, summoning, and medding again before getting started.

Necromancers seem to me to be the most powerful class, whether solo or
in groups (I love what they bring to the table in a group, I wish they
were less soloable so they'd group more). However, they have issues
with merchants/faction and aren't particularly good at travel (not
that they are particularly BAD at it, just in comparison to the next
choices).

Since you mention short play times, I would suggest a Druid or Shaman.
They can both solo quite well, the edge being Druid, and both can get
into pick up groups easily, this edge being Shaman. Stat buffs may
well be a placebo for the most part, but us dumb melees just LOVE them
:).

Don't worry about only grouping for short durations. Just let the
group know, they'll usually be glad to have you for the SoWs and
buffs, join for 30 minutes, benefit the group for an hour, most groups
will take the trade. SoW makes travel much easier, and Druid ports
make getting anywhere a breeze.

Short term play sessions can also make you some coin as a porter
and/or buffer.
