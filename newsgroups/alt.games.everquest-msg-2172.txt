Well, I'd flame you if I didn't have a 48 druid and 50 enchanter and KNOW
you are correct.

If my enchanter has to log there's a very good chance that the group will
have to disband.  If grouped with friends that's kind of an anchor...if you
leave you feel guilty.  If a group of 5 guildies want to hunt in a dungeon
and I can't make it (being the only 40+ druid in the guild) that means that
they may not be able to hunt there.

On the plus side, I was the only enchanter in Fear last month and I was the
only one allowed to /yell, and when I did, I was hit with probably 3000hp
(out of 2100 :) ) of healing.  Most healers had a "Heal the enchanter!"
hotbutton.

Now, not to slam druids though...my friend's is a 49 and I know that that's
much nicer than my level 48.  The nuking is "ok."  The damage shield is
"ok."  At level 51 the healing is "ok."

But, dunno, I prefer "special" and "needed" and "loved" to "ok."  But maybe
I'm funny that way. :)
