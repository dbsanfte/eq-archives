Just lately I've been doing a lot of guild ring wars (coldain 10th ring) -
now were finally done with our dain farming heh.  And its during these times
that most people seem to be in the channel.

its hard to have a conversation when you see ......
"You dirty dog!"
"You dirty dog!"
"You dirty dog!"
"You dirty dog!"
"You wil not evade me xxxx!" (which of course courses the other 10 giants to
all then insta-summon the same person

across 15 lines on your screen every wave!

Theres 3-4 of us who are often in there, and occasionaly we have a good
chat.. I like it because its somewhere i can easily say hi to people from
here, but its not filled with continous spam or chatter that i struggle to
keep up with.

Im in a very raid-focused guild (several targets a day, 6 in 7 days a week)
and including AGE, have 7 channels setup.. so its slow pace suits me just
fine :)
