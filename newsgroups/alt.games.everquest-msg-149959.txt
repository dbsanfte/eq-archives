Usually, when hotkey/social settings keep getting "lost", it's
because the appropriate INI file (or entire EQ directory) has gotten
tagged "Readonly" somehow.

When that happens, you make changes, the game tries (and fails)
to write them to the disk, but it looks like it worked because
it produces no error message (/bonk programmers) and the game
uses the "in-memory" copy of your settings until you die/zone/whatever,
at which point it tries to reload them from disk and lo and behold
the original file settings get read back in again.

Yes, I know that's a run-on sentence, so sue me.

Your "settings" are stored in the following files:

   <charname>_<servernumber>.ini - most settings, including
                      hotkeys, socials, etc.

   ui_<charname>_<servernumber>.ini - most user-interface
                      settings, like window positions,
                      window preferences, resolution, etc.

   bzr_<charname>_<servernumber>.ini - your "Bazaar" settings,
                      like how much you want to sell each
                      type of item for, etc.

   <charname>_<servernumber>.opt - no longer used as of
                      early June, 2002 (used to be used
                      for socials).

"charname" is your character's name.

"servernumber" is the Verant numeric code which represents
your server.  For example, Quellious is "30".

Make sure that your <charname>_<servernumber>.ini file
is *not* "readonly".  One quick way to verify this (when
you're not in the game) is to copy it to a safe location,
then try to delete it.  You'll get a warning if it's
tagged "readonly".  If you do manage to delete it, remember
to copy the "saved" copy back to your EQ directory.

One way that files can be tagged readonly is if you've
copied them back to disk from a CD-ROM archive/backup.

On Win-XP (and I think some flavors of Win2K), it's
possible for an entire directory to be flagged readonly.
This can be tweaked from the "windows explorer" window,
although it's kind of squirrely.

If somehow your EQ directory, or any of your .INI files,
have gotten marked as readonly, change them to read/write.
