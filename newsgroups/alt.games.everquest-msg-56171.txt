I agree and understand that Warriors get more hit points per STA than
SK/PAL, but there are cases of huge discrepancies in STA.  I am 99%
sure that a Ogre SK with 147 STA will have not just more hitpoints
than a DE Warrior with 70 STA, but a lot more.  We need to find people
with high level warriors and SK's and see what their stats are naked,
ie. STA, LEVEL, CLASS.  Now if your a cleric, would you want a Ogre
with 147 STA and SLAM tanking for you, or a DE Warrior without SLAM
and 70 STA?
