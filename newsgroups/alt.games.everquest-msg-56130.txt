Not that I'm really interested in continuing this thread.... but....

Why not just install the AOL .art file extension that has shipped with Internet

Regardless, if you don't like AOL, fine, if you do, great.  I don't really care

compatibility with EQ.... now that has been answered, so everyone can move on
with their lives.
