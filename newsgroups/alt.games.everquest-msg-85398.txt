	Good, I was wondering what the policy was going to be.

	OTOH, consider the alternatives: no moves from Legends back to regular, or

	This means, at least, you can sign up for the service and then decide to
go back to your old server if you don't like it.

	Of course, they still don't have the registration page up...heh.
