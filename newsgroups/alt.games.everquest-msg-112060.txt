Wow, I found 51 to pretty much breeze by.  52 wasn't too bad either.  The
trick is to spend some time in some decent dungeon zones.  I spent a fair
amount of time in SolB, CoM, and in LGuk, as well as some time in The Hole.
I'm about 40 percent of my way through 53 now as well.

As far as tourism goes, still have a few on my list.

Grobb
New Cazic Thule
Kerra Ridge (Did spend some time there with my baby ranger though)
Kurn's Tower
Sebilis
Chardok
Veeshan's Peak
Velketor's Labyrinth
Temple of Veeshan
Plane of Air
Plane of Growth
Plane of Mischief
Ssraeshza Temple
Sanctus Seru
Vex Thal
