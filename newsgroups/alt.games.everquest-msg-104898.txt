It was never true. /report is really nothing different than a
screenshot.

You have to petition when you do /report, by the way, or it never gets
looked at. Even though the guides can't see the report themselves they
are the ones who tell the GM that its there. /reporting without
petitioning does nothing.

You can only /report once in a certain time period. The text after the
/report is just a description of what you're reporting, it doesn't
serve any technical purpose. It is a good idea to /report people
admitting what they did, that is considered solid proof.

Guides can't check reports. The GM does, usually later on. Guides
don't have any history of /reports on a character, but there is
another system to keep track of who does what that guides *can* see.
Remember that when you do something cheesy like ninjalooting or abuse
- even if you aren't caught they know your name and if you are caught
doing something else you are far less likely to be given a break.
