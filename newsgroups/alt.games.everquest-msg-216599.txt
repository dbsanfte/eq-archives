Id just like to take this opportunity to thank all the people on here and
everquest itself who have helped me. everytime i have asked a question they
have answered and even offered me items without my requesting them. thanx to
all.

and now a quick query (yes another one!!). doesn it matter what food you
have in your inventory? does the character just consume it, even if its say
ratmeat?
