Hello all,

I have an Erudite Necro that just dinged 40. I play casually now maybe only
up to 4 or 5 hours a week so joining a group or raid is kinda pointless
since I won't be around for any long amount of time. Is there anywhere for
my Necro to go that would allow me to solo and gain decent (not uber - just
decent) experience? The WC Tollbooth guards just don't cut it anymore.
Further, I've wanted to find a place in Luclin that may provide this just
for a change of pace and scenery.

Any thoughts and tips would be appreciated.

Thanks.
