When you heal a player, the things fighting that player get ticked off
at you.  Complete Heal gets them very ticked off.  Also, Complete Heal
takes 10 seconds to cast.  In 10 seconds, if a mob decides to start
beating on an Enchanter or a Wizard, that Enchanter or Wizard is dead
at higher levels.

With Complete Heal, you've got to be totally aware of everything that
is going on the fight.  You want to let the tank's health get pretty
far down, so that CH will be most efficient, but you have to make sure
that the fragile caster's won't need a quick heal while CH is casting,
and you've got to be aware of how well aggro is being managed, so you
don't get aggroed.

Besides Complete Heal, Clerics get higher level healing spells that
cast relatively quickly.  When I (a Wizard) am getting beat on, only a
Cleric will keep me alive long enough for someone to get the mob off
me.

You may be a one-trick horse at 50+, but that one trick is juggling 5
balls while riding a unicycle on a tightrope...it's a pretty damned
good trick.
