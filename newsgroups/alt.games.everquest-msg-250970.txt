Great!  I'll have to see whether I can incorporate it into an existing
macro or whether I need to make room for a new hotkey.

Good to know.

Ah, I'd assumed it was sorted by distance.  I'll check that out using
some stationary mobs like merchants.  (The default option in the window,
which as a druid I can't change, just says "Normal", but doesn't give
any clue as to what "Normal" means!)

What I'd really like would be to sort it alphabetically!

Well, I did take a couple measurements.  Not sure what my tracking skill
was for the first one, though.  (I hadn't thought about the possibility
it might change, and was just measuring the range.)  But at skill around
67 the range was just OVER 1k already.  My guess is that the "obvious"
formula of 10 times skill isn't right because even at low levels the
range is more than a few tens of feet.  It's probably got more like
B + C*level for some base distance B and constant C.  Maybe I'll do some
more measurements and try to pin it down better.

Well, sort of.  I couldn't find a way to assign the skill directly to
a turn key.  What I did (modelled after the old Sense Heading trick
that's no longer needed) was to put Tracking on a hotkey, and then
make left-arrow be an "alternate" key for that hotkey.  But this leads
to problems, because if I switch to another set of hotkeys then every
time I turn left I do whatever's on that hotkey.  After several rather
embarrassing episodes(*) I gave up and removed the alternate key.
Is there a way to assign a skill to a turn key without using hotkeys?

(*) More than once, I went to my keyset for memming various spell sets,
memmed my buffs, then turned left and accidentally cleared several gems
to mem some other set.  And at one point I was /ooc'ing in East Karanas
that I was offering free SOWs behind the bank. :)
