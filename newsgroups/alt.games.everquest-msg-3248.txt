If you play Tallon Zek as a lightie this weekend, beware of the Shorties.
Many of them have turned Traitor, and have started killing Elves and Humans
all across Norrath.

Particularly, members of <Tiny Knights> and <Soldiers of Order> have been
involved in this treachery and breach of protocol.  Many others have joined
them in this cowardly sneak attack against their friends and allies.
Several of the honorless turncoats seem to be stalking the pathways to banks
and quest NPC's.

Many of the Shorties, particularly Gnomes, don't appear to be involved, but
it is hard to tell who is friend and who is foe until you feel the blade in
your back.

Also, if you are a Shortie on Tallon, and were not aware of this betrayal,
be forewarned that you may be facing mobs of angry Elves and Humans next
time you log on.
