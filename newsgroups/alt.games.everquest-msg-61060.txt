Unless those watchers are dual weilding, a single level 55+ warrior
with defensive up and one druid at full mana can hold him until the
rest of the group kills off the extra (assuming the group is
rogue/monk heavy).

The only catch is *IF* the dorf in question is dual weilding (and they
spawn that way about half the time), you will need a level 60 warrior
+ complete heals to keep that dorf "mezzed".  Dual weilding named
watchers are no joke.  They hit pretty hard and they also hit fast.
