Hi,

like mentioned before in a mail, this is just one of the whiners that will
try to get another discussion about racial issues.

Lol, I dont know why people want to put totally irrelevant issues into the
game ... they dont have another way to show the world that you are not
satisfied with your life ? They should go back to read their books that will
tell them how bad they should feel ....

A suggestion : make ALL chars green in game ... hm, no good idea because I
think they might start whining because they are light green and not that
dark shape like others ...

BTW : animals have rights too ... why you kill them in game ? MURDERER !!!!

Really everyone with a little bit brain should have read your message right
about the sub-races ... but they always can/will try to blame others for
discrimination lol

Hey this is only a game, a fiction !!!! If they dont enjoy it they should
stop playing and go to newsgroups about racial issues ... think they might
like them more ...

Christian
