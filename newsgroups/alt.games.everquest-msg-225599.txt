Look for the flowing thought Aug's, requiring a bit more points than
you currently have, or some of the other focus effects thatdo become
available.

I think that 35-50 is a sweet spot for LDoN.  The XP is decent enough,
compared to some of the other camps available, and the plat is also
good enough to make it worth your time.  Not the "best in the game"
but good enough overall to make it worth it.  

Post 50, the XP tails off, and you can generally get more PP doing
giants or farming something else, so it may not be worth it overall,
but the points do allow you to pick up items thatare decent compared
to some places.  I think the thread where Monual is considering the
high-end Tak armor as an alternative to Elemental gear proves this
point.

Anyways, LDoN meetsdifferent needs for different levels.  If you're
going to keep doing them.  Find a target for the points and aim for
that.
