I went on a pet-only dungeon and one of the mages cast the lvl 63 version of
this.  I wasn't going to tell the guy how to play his character, but I
wondered WTF he was thinking.  Beyond the fact that these pets are loose
cannons, they blow their mana very quickly, even with Kindle, and then start
meleeing for insanely low DPS.  He changed to Ward of Xegony pretty quickly,
which was a good thing.

The good thing about Malosini compared to Malosi is its fast cast time and
shorter recast time (I think).  When I have malise duty, the quicker the mob
can be debuffed, the quicker the Shammy can slow. If the low level versions
of the Mal line are working for you, great.  I may give it a go myself that
way.  I hoped that the higher levels of the spell would lessen the resists,
but Malosini still gets stuck back in my face alot.

I've been getting mezzed so often in LDoN that this spell looks a bit
tempting.  However, the duration is so short that it seems difficult to make
use of.  Maybe I can just cast it everytime I see one of those winged lion
things in Miragul's Menagerie.

One of the people in my normal group has a high level Cleric and Chanter for
buffing and we get virtue and c5 before every dungeon when this guy is
along.  I could swear that my TPP stacks with both, but not the Druid hp and
mana regen buffs.  I'll have to look more closely next adventure.  One thing
that does seem to stack with Virtue is the shielding line.  I have tended to
dismiss it as inconsequential, but given that it has a MR component, I cast
it on myself before the last couple of dungeons and will continue to do so.

59 spells -
Great Voc - Air.  About what you'd expect - the next level of air pet.  A
nice upgrade to the 53 pet, but it's not earth shaking.

Seeking Flame.  A nice increase in DD potential, particularly with the focus
bracelet, although it is a LoS spell.  The real prize is Firebolt of Tallon
at 61.  500 mana gets you 2000 damage.  I became a DPS machine for the LDoN
encounters where I made a committment to casting FBoT.  The downside is that
I can't malise and cast this spell consistently and the Paladin has to
really be casting his stuns to keep me from getting aggro.

Valiant Companion - I needed this several levels before 59 when I was
camping gnolls and the necros would fear my pet.  I haven't run into many
mobs that cast fear lately, but this is probably a godsend for players in
high level Boss encounters.

ManaStorm - I've gotten shy about AoE's in LDoN.  I guess the mana drain
component would be nice, although I've read that the mana drain component
causes each wave to make two resist checks instead of one.  At 61, my rain
of choice is still Sirocco.  The extra potential damage from Manastorm and
Maelstrom of Thunder don't seem to make up for their increased mana cost.
