Yes, it's a change.  You used to be able to hand in 4 stacks of 4 bone
chips to do 4 simultaneous turnins.

It was stealth-changed 3 or 4 patches ago.  I assume that any other quest
mob that would take 4 stacks of 4 has been changed too.  The bone-chip guy
in Kaladim, the wine quest guy in Neriak, etc.
