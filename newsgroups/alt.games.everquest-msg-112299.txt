Yeah, but you're still basically having a ton of people send in the same
idea. I'm pretty sure that Verant knows the stance of FV players... it just
may not matter to them at this point in time.

I will admit my bias. I have a strong distaste for petitions, and I don't
think they really make much of a difference. If a company is going to make a
change, it's all ready been considered, and they've weighed the pros and
cons. Money comes first, for companies.

Your server is up for a change... and I very seriously doubt you and even
400 people can change it. I don't think it will be the death of the Firona
Vie server... only the original members may leave, but a whole new
generation of players will come.

Heh, that's usually how it works. If you put one big detestable thing in,
you can sneak a lot of less malign ones as everyone focuses on what offends
them the most...
