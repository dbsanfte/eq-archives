Well, I can answer why I have done this in the past.  The guards in Nektulos
hate me, they attack me, and, back when I still got xp for it, I saw nothing
wrong with taking exception to this, and killing them for xp and loot.  Now
that they are green to me, I just ignore them.  I might add, that when I did
kill them, if I saw a newbie nearby in trouble, I helped them out.  Usually
with a heal, thereby allowing them to get xp from a mob that they would have
taken to the guards to kill instead.
