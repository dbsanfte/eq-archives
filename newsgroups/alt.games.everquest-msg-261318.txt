We *are* talking about 75k items here, right? How long do you think they 
would continue to be that desirable if a group of 3-5 50ths could get 
them easily enough?

Face it. Once you get to the point of needing items of that caliber, 
you're gonna have to raid for them. If you don't wish to do that, be 
content with what is more easily attainable. There is no way they can 
create content manageable by your small group yet still yielding the 
items in question.
