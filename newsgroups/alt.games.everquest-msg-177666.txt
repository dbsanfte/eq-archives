Sorry, I didn't mean to pass that off as a conspiracy theory.

I tried for more than an hour to get my "non-LoY pre-ordered" account
to work using every other trick I have picked up over the years
playing EQ and nothing worked. No matter what I did the game crashed
to desktop at character select.

For grins and giggles I put everything back the way it started and
fired up my account with the pre-order. I was able to login and play
for more than 2 hours with no problems. When I logged off, I tried the
other account, and it still crashed at character select.

I don't think it is a "conspiracy" I think the problem is directly
related to the LoY files/changes that are going in incrementally as
they get closer to launch (I selected "download" LoY files when the
option was first offered). I put up my original post as a possible
cause of the problem that some players are having. 

Again I don't think the problem is intentional or a scheme to get
people to buy LoY. I think it is an unintended consequence of the
incremental file deployment.
