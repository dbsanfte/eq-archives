    You didn't state what race. That does make a difference in some slots,
most noticeably wrists.

    In general, get Wu's. The AC is exceptional for monk gear and they
actually get more bonus AC per AGI than other classes (if the devs at the
Fan Faire can be believed). Specific items to get include Orc Fang Earrings
(NOT Cougar Claw, you need the HPs here), Ulthork Hide Collar, Frog
Crown/Executioner's Hood (depending on Crown price on your server),
Enshrouded Veil, Gatorscale Leggings, Azure Sleeves, Symbols of Loyalty to
Vox (human) / Gold Emerald/Peridot bracers (Iksar), Velium Fire Wedding
Rings, Gem Inlaid Gauntlets, Drolvarg Mantle, Kunzar Cloak, Thick Leather
Apron, and VERY important, a good weight reducing pack. With this sort of
setup you'll be close to max weight, but if you have this gear then the loot
in Field of Bone or West Freeport likely won't be of interest to you
anyways.
