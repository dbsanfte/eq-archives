I would take some variant of the crafting system of SWG (yes, the game is
disappointing, I recently cancelled all three of my accounts after playing
since early beta), still the best crafting system I have ever come across. I
would take a variant of the mission system from AO (which, unlike LDoN,
allows solo mission and missions of any size party) and add to it the
adventure points idea from LDoN, get RID of the game timer. I would like the
world architecture of AC, which allowed zone-free travel across miles of
terrain (you could look off into the distance and see a tall mountain peak,
hours away, and run toward it to explore, watching it approach as you
traveled), and was infinitely morphable allowing for *potential* (note the
dreaded "p" word) alteration by game guides for monthly story arc changes. I
would take some variant of DAoC's combat system allowing for a wide variety
of specialized combat actions that you actively combine together during
battle (thus avoiding the start battle, go get a cup of coffee syndrome). I
would take some element of DAoC's PvP, in particular the anonymity and
inability to communicate with enemy races, to avoid those endearing "I
rOxXoRs jOo" quips.

Then, I would take all of these things and put them in Norrath with all the
EQ content. Then I'd be set!
