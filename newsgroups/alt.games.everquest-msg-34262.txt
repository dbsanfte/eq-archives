To have fun.

Happily, the vast majority of the time I can do that by actually
playing the game. But since I had no pressing matters to deal with (I
was collecting spider silks), I was able to devote a chunk of my
attention to dealing with this person.

I won't deny that I was interested in this particular incident, but to
say that I enjoy persecuting other players is blatantly incorrect. I
enjoy playing the game, a *lot*, and when someone does something that
detracts from my enjoyment of the game, I feel quite strongly about
it. Hence my reactions.

This is why I petitioned the name Wantsomedrinks in the first place,
and why I was willing to devote 15 minutes to dealing with the fake
GM. I didn't hunt down either of these individuals; Wantsomedrinks
walked past me shouting that he needed a port to BB - he advertised
his name, loudly, in bright red letters. And Evisceratus, of course,
came looking for *me*, and initiated the discussion with lies and
threats.

Now, if you can manage the compartmentalization this requires, I
freely admit that I have enjoyed these heated discussions, on USENET,
about the people I've encountered and dealt with in-game. I'm far from
being the only person who has related some story of an encounter here,
I just happen to have done it on a hot-button subject.

And while I do enjoy the Usenet aspect, I would much rather that
everyone would simply obey the rules of the game in the first place
and not damage the experience of the players around them.

You're right. 850 messages scattered in 4 or 5 threads on more or less
the same subject is no indicator of interest in the topic. And when
you look at how heated many of those messages are, it's even less an
indicator of the level of interest.

Odd, that's exactly the reason I have for petitioning the players
we're discussing. One thought it would be fun to use a name that was a
blatant violation of the rules, thereby hurting the fantasy setting,
and the other thought it would be fun to impersonate a GM and threaten
me, which I'm sure you'll agree was an attempt to have fun at my
expense.

I would like nothing better than to just play the game and not have to
deal with this kind of person, but when they impact *my* enjoyment of
the game, then I *will* take whatever actions I can to correct the
situation. I'm not seeking these people out - I'm reacting when they
force themselves upon me.
