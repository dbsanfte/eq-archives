My, now level 4, cleric found death to be an inconvenience now, but nothing
like prepatch, as he had to rememorize those spells.  Xp was pretty insane
in Nektulos forest.  I left corpses littering the landscape as I explored
the new Nektulos, the only issue I ran into was that I was down to one food
and one water of my newbie supplies, and you no longer get new food and
water when you die.
