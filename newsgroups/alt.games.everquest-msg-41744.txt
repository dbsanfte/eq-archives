Absolutely not! The thing to remember is that sneak lowers aggro
radius.  I have _many_ times separated a camp, and with a good
lead back to my group, had an aggro blue/even/yellow/red pop
in front of me...it is entirely possible to:

1) push "sneak" while running
2) sneak past the critter
3) keep sneaking until your own pull is also
    past the critter
4) un-sneak and finish the run back to the
    group

The trick is aggro distance.  If you're sneaking when both
you AND the pull go past the possible add, he won't add,
either.  Distance has a lot to do with it, as well as facing.

But it is EXTREMELY possible to sneak pull right past
an aggro mob with another of his friends in tow.

That is true under level 50 or so, and some folks would
argue it's only true up to level 35.  After then, I've seen
entirely too many monks successfully FD and get pounded
to death while laying on the ground...might as well have
the druid pull.

Sneak pulling is much more art than skill...but skill comes
in to it, too :-).
