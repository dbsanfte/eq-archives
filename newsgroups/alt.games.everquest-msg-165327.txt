-Machine specs are
-
-Board = Asus A7A266 with latest BIOS
-Winfast Gforce3 with Nvidia 40.72 drivers
-SBLive5.1 latest creative drivers
-512 Mb 2100 DDR mem
-Ath  1.333Ghz
-XP Pro - patched to latest 
-Nothing obvoius/untoward running in background.

-May be I will go back to the 30.82 drivers - but thought I would
check
-here first.

-TIA for any help
-Cheers


I actually had this very problem start in November 11th..... it was
weird, it only happed on either side of the BW/DL zone lines and no
where else.... and continued right up until I installed the new vid
drivers from NVidia..... might try reinstalling DirectX.


Good luck!
