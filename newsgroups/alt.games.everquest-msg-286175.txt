Welcome back, Lance. I have just recently returned after a lengthy
hiatus, myself, and know well what you mean about shaking the rust
off. Literally minutes after logging in for my first time back, I was
rushed off to a raid on the Zeks with some guildmates and members of
various other allied guilds. Our rag-tag bunch finished it all short
of taking down RZ (cat herding syndrome finally caught up with us in
RZ's pit, though the RL had done a great job managing the show up to
that point). I was able to get a few flags along the way and we had
enough people so that my re-visited newb-ness went virtually
unnoticed. :P
