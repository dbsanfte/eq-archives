 >>This is similar to invisible mobs named "A light breeze" which only 
serve to emote things like "A light breeze blows your way" when you get 
near it.  I'd heard a theory/reason behind the 'unnamed' ones but can't 
honestly recall it.

The one that got me recently was "The River Source".  Saw that because a 
kobold was attacking it.  I joined in and pounded away as did my pet and 
the life bar hardly moved.  Although for a river it hit decently in the 
30s although not consistantly.
