Also, do not forget to get focus effect items. Mana Preservation items can 
help you spend less on each spell you cast (which makes your mana 
effectively regenerate faster, as your 100 mana spell only takes 90 mana 
worth of med time to recoup). Extended Enhancement means you cast your 
buffs less often (haste, hos, etc) and can help cut down your mana/hour 
consumption.
