I *think* he's saying that he's encountered a cleric who MLs (which is a
common strategy to make sure that dots get covered) but then refuses to
buff.

My answer to him is that most clerics don't do that, and certainly *I*
don't. But if the cleric is MLing, you should demand your buffs up-front,
and if they refuse... don't let them ML. It's not that hard, really.

Personally I usually Symbol the tank, puller, slower and chanter, and
sometimes myself, before a single item is looted.
