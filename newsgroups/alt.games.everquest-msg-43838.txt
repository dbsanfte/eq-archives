I noticed the same thing upgrading (?) from
a V5 > GForce3. The best solution I've found
is to jump the res up a notch or two since the
card can maintain good framerates at higher
resolution than a Voodoo running most software.
The "swim" is still there but not as annoying.
Also some Detonator drivers have more filtering
options than others.
