Which is made all the more amusing by the fact that, at your last
>election, in many areas, people's votes *were* done away with
>(particularly black voters, I understand) because Dubya bought them
off.

How is the fact that some people might have sold their votes
interpreted as their votes being "done away with?" if they got
something for their vote, then they voted, right? If one party offers
something (which seems to be how elections work, each side offers
something and you chose) and the other party ups the offer with cash..
Then the people who prefer the cash to promises vote for cash, and the
guy who is buying the vote. It may be illegal, and rightfully so, but
that don't mean that the vote has been "done away with", it's simply a
somewhat more simple and quick process of meeting election promises.

No electoral corruption there? Must mean that both sides are so
similar and agreeable that they don't care who gets in..
