Your pauses are 30 seconds long, not 3 seconds; the pause command is in 
10ths of a second.

The pause on each line takes place after the other command, so your 
macro will cast 1, fail to pause, attempt 2nd cast and fail because 1st 
is still casting (or fizzling), then pause an extremely long time, cast 
3rd, extremely long pause, cast 4th, extremely long pause, cast 5th.

Pressing the hotbutton again will restart immediately, so you'll miss 
1st and probably 2nd (unless 5th fizzled), extreme pause, then do 3rd 
4th and 5th as before.

IF the pauses work at all.  I think they have to be first on the line, 
as in /pause 300, /cast 1.  In which case your macro will try 5 casts in 
a row, so fast that even fizzles will probably cause two or three of the 
casts to be skipped.

A 3 second pause (/pause 30) with a 2.2 second recast time means that if 
you are casting a spell with a cast time longer than .8 seconds, your 
macro will still be casting or recovering before the next cast command 
comes up.

As you note, some spells have longer recast timers, so sticking with 
spell cast time + 2.2 seconds isn't always going to work either. 
Building in a little extra time helps... which is what I suspect you 
were doing with the 3 second pause, but in that case you completely 
forgot to include the cast time of the spell.
