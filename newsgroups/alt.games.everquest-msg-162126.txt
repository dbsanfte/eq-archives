Hey, folks.

Sorry to hit y'all with one of these, but I'm getting frustrated, and
I was hoping you might have some advice.

My 30 WE druid (one of billions, I know) is my first character, and
I'm still not familiar with all of the zones.  I'm just wondering what
would be the best place to hunt at this level.  Up until about 29,
South Karana was pretty good, but Tesch Mas Gnolls and Aviak Avocets
are giving less and les exp these days.

Any suggestions for the novice would be much appreciated!
