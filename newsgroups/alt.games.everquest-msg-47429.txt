Just went to the EQ web site to try to find an article they posted
earlier this year where they broke down, by percentage, the total number
of characters of each class across the servers. I'm almost positive that
the three least played were monks, wizards, and shadowknights.  Which
<I> find shocking because it seems like every bastard in the game has a
monk. Forget where Bards were, but I seem to recall it was closer to the
middle of the list.
  At the top end, of course, Druids outstripped everyone else by a fat
margin. I think Warriors were right up there too.
