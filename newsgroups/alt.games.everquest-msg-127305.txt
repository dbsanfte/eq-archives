Matted halfling hides are a pain to geth. Needed for the dark elf
necro newbie armor and totally impossible to get!

There are, as far as I know, two option on how to get them (except
from buying - I am on Fv so luckily those blasted things are not no
drop or else it would be totally impossible).

1) wait at newbie log for that once in an hour spawn for two
halflings. They are impossible to kill at level 1 to 3 and they stop
dropping hides when you ding to 5 (they are green then). So you have
to take them at 4, but if your pet is yellow to you they don't drop
the hides and even if you can kill them without them being trivial
they still drop them only once in every 10 times and they give such a
load of XP that you have to be lucky if you even get your hands on one
before they turn green.

2) Take the higher halflings on the stump. This is also totally
impossible. The grou is way to big to even think of attacking these
guys unless you are so high that only the captain might drop of his
hide. But what use is the term "newbie" armor then?

The human monk I used to play had it so much easier with matted LION
pelts.

Oh well, does anyone here have any ideas on getting those pelts?
