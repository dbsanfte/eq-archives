On the road, past the bandit camp and the two bandits who stand next
to the road, have a seat by the road marker just before the last inn
close to the NK zoneline. He will run very near that marker and might
even agro on you but feel free to watch track just in case. I can't
tell you how many times I was running , one of my 9 characters to FP
for some deathfist orc fun and got clocked by him at that spot. Oh
yeah, a werewolf also spawns around that area sometimes too at night.
Be patient till he spawns, he might not be up.
