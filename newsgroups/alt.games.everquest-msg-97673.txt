Wow, there's no mystery as to what pushes my buttons, is there?

I quite agree.

Well, certainly some parents lack respect for authority, and teach this
to their kids.  My own observation is that more often parents are just
uninvolved, or even downright neglectful, and so fail to teach their
children respect for authority whether or not they have it themselves.

I don't believe she was.

Forgive me, but I don't know what you mean by "(op)."

He does.  His brother does, too.

BTW, after having watched me compose two such responses, he is
telling me "The greatest victory is the battle not fought."  I suppose
he's right, so I'll try not to keep letting this get to me.
