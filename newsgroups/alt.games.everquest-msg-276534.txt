If the Collector items are Lore, of course, it makes it harder to
collect multiple sets to get the multiple potions.  I'll have to see.

I'm also curious to hear whether the potion affects ALL sources of
xp gain.  I've heard that completing a DoN mission gives a sizable
chunk of xp, so can you double that by quaffing a dose?  (I don't
know how the mission xp compares to 15 minutes of grinding xp mobs,
but I got the impression it was pretty big.)
