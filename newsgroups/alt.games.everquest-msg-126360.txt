Well, that's what one version says anyway.

New International Version:  Do not allow a sorceress to live.
New American Standard Bible:  You shall not allow a sorceress to live.
Amplified Bible:  You shall not allow a woman to live who practices sorcery.
New Living Translation:  A sorceress must not be allowed to live.
King James Version:  Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
New King James Version:  You shall not permit a sorceress to live.
21st Century King James Version:  Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
American Standard Version:  Thou shalt not suffer a sorceress to live.
Young's Literal Translation:  A witch thou dost not keep alive.
Darby Translation:  Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.

One thing of particular interest to me here, is that apparently it is ok for
a man to practice sorcery.  Is witch gender specific?  It always has been to
me, but just curious if that is the general consensus.

In the future, if you really need to know, here is a link that was the very
first one to pop up in a google search for "bible online".
