LoIO at the sarnak fort or goblin mines
South Karana, either KFC or Spires (or the front area of Paw)
FM giant fort
Highkeep basement ( I did 22 to 30 in a week there on my warrior, and that's
with a day off to camp stuff in Najena)

If you have your own hunting group.
Permafrost
Runnyeye
Dalnir (and you can stay here through 36 at least)
Soluseks Eye  (AKA Sol A)
Unrest (very good for paladins, lots of undead)
