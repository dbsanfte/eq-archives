Speaking from a min/max standpoint, a human ends up slightly ahead as
far as stats go. Their slightly higher STR and STA help out very well
early on in your career. Their stats are traditionally well rounded,
being good at everything, but great at nothing. However, if you don't
know an area very well, the no nightvision thing can get a bit hairy,
until later levels when you get songs that give you infra/ultravision.

Now for my personal opinion, my first bard was a wood elf, and I
wouldn't have it any other way. Even with a wood elf's lower STR and
STA, there are enough fairly inexpensive items that can boost those
two attributes quite nicely. Also, the extra CHA that comes with being
a dashingly beautiful woodland elf helps with a few of our more
important songs. Also, the higher your initial CHA, the less gear you
will have to get later on to boost that particular stat and the more
slots you will have open to boost other stats and resists. Also,
another thing that I think was not mentioned is that Wood elves start
out with a 50 skill (IIRC) in Hiding. I cannot count on fingers, toes,
holes in the walls, WHATEVER, how many times hiding at lower levels
has saved me while I sit in the fairly dangerous area in and around
Crushbone and recover HP, or go AFK to visit the little boy's room.
Even at 38, I still use Hide if I don't happen to have invis memmed.

Also, just another little personal thing. My favorite starting city in
the game is Kelethin. The newbie area, although not well defined in
some places, is nice and large, and crawling with life. Orc hill and
Crushbone serve as very obvious areas in which to advance. You could
live your life within two zones, Greater Faydark and Crushbone, until
around level 20 or so, if you're not the type of person who bores
easily and constantly needs a change of scenery.

Both Freeport and Qeynos both rub me the wrong way as far as their
newbie hunting is concerned. In Freeport, the newbie area is adequate
up to level 4, but then, if you want to train, or buy any of your new
songs, you have to zone into North Freeport, then walk halfway around
the zone to get to either the Bard's guild or the bank. Then, when you
hit level 4, the next zone over is East Commons. God forbid if you try
to sneak into the southern desert portion of the zone, unless you LIKE
getting torn up by red con skeletons and pumas. Or maybe you become a
little adventerous and try going as far west as the first orc camp.
The mobs around that area can tear you to pieces sooner than you can
say "Loading, Please Wait..." Qeynos is more or less the same, the
newbie garden runs dry at level 4, but then the hunting within Qeynos
hills doesn't supply you with quite the same amount of hunting which
the newbie garden does. MOBs are few and far between, and by around
level 8 or so, most of them green out on you. Then you're stuck
between training in Blackburrow, or taking your chances in West
Karana. Soloing in Blackburrow is very much possible (I've been doing
it with my human ranger since level 8 and he is level 13 now, still
soloing in that train garden) so the beginning teen levels for a
Qeynos bard can be quite prosperous, but just getting to that point
can be a real pain.
