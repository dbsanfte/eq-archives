That's what I meant.

Also, think about this one for a moment.  As bards, working on our epic, we
have the easy, run around with Selo's and druid friend to play messanger boy
or girl and then the other side of the coin, Dragonslayers-r-us.  Where as
the 4 weapon/objects/instruments are dropped items that aren't a long and
drawn out quest and they aren't nodrop so any bard who has the money could
probably buy them.

By bringing the Epic into the picture you are pretty much comparing apples
with oranges.  Even the Main Gauche and Wing blade are different from the
epic in that they aren't epics.  The time that one puts into camping one mob
may be equal to the time of doing 1 part of one fourth of the Bard epic (not
including the stupid ass torch marathon thingy).
