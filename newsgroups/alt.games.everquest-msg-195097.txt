I wasn't too clear on this one myself; bards hardly need powerleveling and make
excellent power levelers once they get charm (since charm works as a total mem
blur)

Vah Shir bards have the edge over human, half elf, and woodie bards in a couple
ways: innate safe fall at 50 (don't get skill till 19 or so and it caps at 40
for other races)  which is handy for selos speed running, they get a quest for
a primary slot string instrument thats easily completed by 10th level
untwinked, and they start the game right there next to good old paladul (this
last isn't so important if you have POP of course, since -everyone- starts near
paladul!)

Perhaps given these advantages, Vah Shir Bards are being looked down on as the
new halfling druid?

If so, well easy is relative, bards aren't easy any way you look at it!

Llyric, stupid ass Vah Shir Bard
