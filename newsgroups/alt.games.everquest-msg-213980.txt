I never used the word superior.

Once again, the darkness line has a good DOT componet to it, like 100's of
points of damage for the better ones. It is like casting snare + stinging
swarm<or creeping crud or what have you> in a single spell.

If I had a snare+DOT like that on my druid that did that I would definately
have occasion to use it solo or grouped.
