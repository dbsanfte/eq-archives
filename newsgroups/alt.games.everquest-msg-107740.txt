This 20% disparity has been enough to keep us excluded from raids.  Sound
familiar?  Ah well, if I can't raid, I'll just go solo something.  A shame,
though, if I were a druid, at least I'd be able to solo something that gives
me XP.

If you're in an uber-guild, you should already know the answer.

So, what utility are you going to add to rogues, pallys, SK's, and mages?
Or should we take a back seat while you complain that you can only
do -everything- 80% as well as the best?
