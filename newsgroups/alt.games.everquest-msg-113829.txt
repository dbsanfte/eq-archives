My main Shajozim just purchased these for 95K + Golem Jawbone + Bracelet of
Comprehension (total value of about 125K) in The Tribunal server. Spent a
week in auction channel looking for them.   Basically gave up on them and
wasnt in auction and I got swamped with tells.  Ppl I didn't know were
informing me that someone had them for sale-WOOT!

I have alread bought back the Bracelet of Comprehension, now to find another
Golem Jawbone /sighs

Hope that helps.
