Going against the "system" is the mantra of the lazy and the insecure.
It requires no work and no thought or intelligence. 

The real challenge is working within the system and still
distinguishing yourself. Take the case of EQ. People with stupid names
stand out (which is a no brainer). Anyone can roll up a character with
a stupid, vulgar, or non-compliant name. It takes no special skill,
talent or creativity. The people with in-character names that stand
out are almost universally the smartest, funniest, nicest, and most
talented people you will meet in-game. They build a reputation through
their actions and the relationships they build in-game. They stand out
due to strength of character. (pun intended)

The saddest part is that the "rule breakers" think they are unique and
exercising their independence, when in reality they are nothing more
than lazy little lemmings that are a dime a dozen..
