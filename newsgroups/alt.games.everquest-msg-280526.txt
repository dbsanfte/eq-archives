I'm wondering if Seeq is using EQWindows or WinEQ to manage the rendering 
of background displays or something. That could make four instances on 1GB 
of RAM feasible, if the utility lived up to its billing.

Actually, speaking as a mild PC enthusiast myself, use of Arctic Silver 
over thermal tape can make a noticeable difference in your machine's 
capabilities, as its improved thermal transfer properties make it a more 
effective solution, thus allowing for a heavier processing load.

Sure, it *may* be overkill to list it in this case, but it could be a 
factor. Besides, he obviously put a lot of research and effort into his 
rig. Let him wave it around a bit. ;)
