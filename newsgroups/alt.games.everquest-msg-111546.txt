well, its a growing entertainment niche isn't it?  The numbers have been
and will continue to get bigger and time goes on, but there have been
text MUD's that existed for over a decade, there are online gaming
communities(Air Warrior until just recently) that have existed over a
decade and this at a time when very few had computers on the internet. 
The point here is not 2-3 years is not a long time for online
"character" and as time goes on that will only increase.

to each his own I guess but still fact is if you have only gotten to 30
there is a whole lot(surely you don't need me to define that) you have
seen to be able to decide if you like it or not.
