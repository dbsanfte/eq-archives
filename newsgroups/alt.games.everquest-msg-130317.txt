hehe.. all I can say about is, they must not of all been casting or
letting pets do most of the damage.

I was soloing once in DL and I pulled drolvarg with malosi, as it was
coming after me a monk came along and KS'd it from me and pulled to
his group., which consisted of him, 2 warriors and a cleric

BTW, it was my mob to begin with.. it was just standing there no
damage on it and there was no one in sight anywhere, even a FD'd
monk.. was level part of field so could see pretty far.

Well ran back and got my pet and ran back to them
I was around 49 at the time and they weren't  but may 4 or 5 levels
below me.

Sic'd my pet on it and started nuking... easily took it back from
them, even with the cleric trying to nuke it too.
They already had done about 1/4 damage on it.
