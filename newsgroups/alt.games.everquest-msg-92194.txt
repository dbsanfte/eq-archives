Umm, $20/hour is only $40k/year.  It's really not much money for even 
basic customer service folk.  It's really not much at all for experienced 
CS folks with specialized knowledge.  I know that typical ISP CS folk for 
the big ISPs start at $40k or so, and range up to $75-80k on the east 
coast, and I assume SanDiego has similar costs.  (I know that, for Qwest 
at least, San Diego is in the same expense band as NYC.)
That covers the salary portion, but remember that the total HR costs for 
each employee are generally twice the salary.  In this case each GM is 
going to cost Verant 80k/year, and for 19 GMs, that works out to over 
$125k/month in GM costs alone.

How do you claim that price is absurd?  I'm going to assume that you think 
that $10/month is a reasonable cost for the existing servers, since you 
have been and, as far as I know remain, an active player.  Each regular 
server has 1 full-time GM.  Legends has 19 full-time GMs.  I think we can 
agree that the server upkeep costs are pretty similar.  So you're getting 
19 times the level of paid GM support for only 4 times the cost.  I think 
that's a pretty good deal, if GM support is important to you.

Why?  People don't have an issue with paying $60/month for cable.  Nobody 
bitches about paying $50/month for phone service, when the phone itself 
only costs $9.95 at Radio Shack.  Well, other than the fact that a lot of 
people are morons.
