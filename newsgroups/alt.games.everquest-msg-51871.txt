The 1 point you put in research gives you skill 16, but the cap for research
is 5*(level-15), i.e. you have already exceeded the maximum research skill
you can have at L17, so you're not getting any skill increases. Try again at
level 20. :) Personally, I think the Concordance quests are too much hassle
anyway (last I checked some were broken anyway), just use training points
when you need to, it's not like there is much else to use them for.

Muffins are still around, as far as I know. If you can't find any on
vendors, try taking up baking - most items are low weight.
