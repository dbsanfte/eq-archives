Worse yet is when a caster starts panicking and swinging and
casting more spells at the mob! Doh! Great now I have to overcome
that hate on the list as well.

Running around will actually make you get hit MORE!
If you stand still and FACE the monster (or monsters) you
will get hit LESS than if you run around! You will take more
damage from rear attacks and get hit more often.

I have 2 tank characters and 2 casting characters so I know
both side of this fence. I can't count the number of times I have
gotten mobs on me(as a caster) and held my ground and the
tank can immediately taunt it off me.
