As a first class, I'd suggest Karana worhshipping halfling druid. 
Most players will snub you, but druids, and particularly halfling
druids which get a 5% xp bonus, are pretty easy to level, and will
teach you a fair amount of the game as long as you listen to more
experienced players suggestions.  By the time you reach level 30 or
so, you'll probably know which character class you want to play (and
will have probably experimented with several other classes by that
time).

As far as fastest levelling goes, most people say bards, and I agree
with them.  Bards have several ways of "kiting" mobs that can yield
fast xp if done well.  On the other hand, there's a learning curve
with bards, and you can end up with hand problems due to the amount of
keyclicking that's required to "twist" songs.
