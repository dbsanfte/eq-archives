What is the accomplishment in that? that is something I did most 
every weekend growing up [all in western new york - caledonia to 
leroy, back to calidonia, to fairport, hang out for a few hours, 
head back to caledonia, head to leroy, back to caledonia. Repeat 
on sunday so Matthew can get back to fairport. Amazing what kids 
will do when they dont have a car and want to accomplish things.]

Heck, without all the 'what do you want to do' discussions 
[usually ended up get pizza, rent a movie, and hang at aru's 
house because her parents have a vcr and tv in the family room 
that we can conquor and gain remote control domination] you can 
do a century in a heck of a lot less than the 12 or 14 hours we 
used to do while mucking about. Double century weekends I guess 
must be a thing of the past with everybody getting cars at 16, 
and the computer/game console/taxi of Mom thing=\
