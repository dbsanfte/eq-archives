It's not EQW sadly it's a change in the code of EQ, the client seems a
lot less tolerant of things like slow zoning and swapping between
instances of EQW so it crashes either to desktop, to login screen or
with the "wow, you crashed!  tell us about it plz" window..

You can run two instances of EQ and swap between them using windowed
mode but this is clunky and crashes more often than it used to as
well.
