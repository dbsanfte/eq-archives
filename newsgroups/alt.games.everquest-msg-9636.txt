I find it truly odd that people who purport to dislike, even hate,
Bizbee so much as you and others do can't seem to just do the obvious
thing and ignore him. It's easy, you know - you just use a kill file. 

If you actually have the will power to truly use a kill file, I can
tell you from personal experience that the Usenet experience is
greatly improved.

On you being 100% certain? No, I really don't care what you're certain
of.

As for Bizbee, I don't share the fascination for him that so many
others here (yourself included?) seem to. My opinion of him is based
solely upon his actions in this venue - and he's coming out a lot
cleaner than his detractors are.

Sorry that I didn't rise to the bait like you hoped.
