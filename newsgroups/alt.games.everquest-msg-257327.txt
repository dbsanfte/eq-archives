Which is why I claimed that having an epic that fits in the Range slot 
on a character who doesn't do his principle damage via range slot would 
be a GOOD THING.

Other melee will eventually get better weapons than their epics, and 
then it will come down to a choice, epic or other weapon.  Rangers, on 
the other hand, will be able to equip their epic while weilding their 
better weapons!

This assumes, of course, that the stats and effects on the bow are 
worthwhile, eventually perhaps the epic bow will also be discarded by 
rangers in favor of a better range slot item.
