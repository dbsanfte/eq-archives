Depends on why you want to be in the guild.  My guild is a younger
one, far far from uber. Heh - lots of alts, too. 
But most of us get along great and I'm 95% certain that I can get a
group with known guildies every time I log on.  I know 'em, I know
what to expect from 'em, I like it a LOT better than pickup groups.
THATS why I'm in the guild I'm in.  More of a social thing then an
end-game thing.  

We lose some older members from time to time to high-end raiding
guilds.  But their alts stay, and sometimes the main comes back after
a month or so.
