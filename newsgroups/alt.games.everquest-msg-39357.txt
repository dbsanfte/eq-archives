If you want to train a skill you can right-click on a trainer (the one on
the right balcony at the Kaladim warrior's guild is one). It will open a
"trade" window with all the skills he can train on the left side and your
inventory screen on the right. Now click on a skill you want to train and
click the "Train" button. It should give you a message like "You have now
improved you skill in xxxxxx".

Some skills require some cash to train because you are proficient in them
already. This will be shown by 1 or 2 coins with a number in them. This will
only happen if you're well enough in a skill, starting from skill-level 16 I
think.
Some skills require you to be of a certain level to train and that is shown
by the words "Level xx" instead of the coins.

Don't waste skills in languages or tradeskills unless you want to really
start that skill.
The first point you put into a skill (which requires an initial training,
i.e. not any weapon skills for a war) determines it's start-off point. If
you put your first point into Bash at lvl 7, Bash will be level 7 from start
and the next point will raise it to 8. If you put your first point into Bash
at lvl 30, Bash will be level 30 from start and the next point will raise it
to 31.
