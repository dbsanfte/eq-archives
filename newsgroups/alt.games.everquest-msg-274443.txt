> I probably wouldn't have discussed it with the officers or him.

Discussing the matter with the officers is a professional courtesy I extend 
to them, it's not to be confused with asking for permission. Of the many 
types of decisions a leader must make, here's how I usually break them down:

1) Command decisions. On these I consult no one and make the rules as I see 
fit pursuant to my responsibilities. I will usually communicate to my staff 
before announcing a decision, just as a point of communication and 
professional courtesy so that they are not compromised by having to hear 
about it for the first time from someone else;
2) Consultative decisions. These are decisions which I am responsible for 
making, but for which I entertain input before making my decision. I will 
usually inform staff when this type of decision is being made to make clear 
to them that I'm seeking their input but making the decision myself; and
3) Consensus decisions. These are decisions that the group must agree to as 
a group.

Circumstances determine which type of decision is appropriate and in this 
case I made the command decision to deguild the guy and spoke with the 
officer team first before taking the action. One thing I learned from the US 
legal system is that judges rarely announce controversial matters in real 
time immediately upon hearing arguments. Instead, they announce that they 
are "taking the matter under submission" and then issue their opinion 
afterwards. This is true even if they've already decided during argument. 
This avoids confrontation and allows both sides to cool down after making 
their arguments. I used a similar technique here to tell the guy that I 
would discuss and get back to him, giving him time to cool down and accept 
his likely fate, while giving me time to brief the officers on the command 
decision I had already made.

I didn't put the guy on ignore, but was prepared to do so if necessary. As 
it turned out, he accepted the decision without resistance and left the 
game, making it a non issue for everyone.

As clinical as all this may sound, I won't deny that the main reason I 
posted this was for the entertainment value from the sense of justice that I 
enjoyed meting out to someone who I felt finally got what was coming to 
them. ;-)
