To be safe, highlight everything in your EQ folder and then right-click
anywhere in the blue and choose Properties.  At the bottom will show its
attributes.  Make sure the Read Only box is TOTALLY white (it might be grey
or checked).

If that doesn't work try moving all your ini and opt files out of that
folder and restarting the game.  I guess it's possible one of those other
files are corrupting the eqclient.ini, but I'm just tossing out a guess.
