Television Viewing and Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Young Adults:
The CARDIA Study

DIRECT QUOTES 

"In this study, we found associations of self-reported heavy TV
viewing with obesity, physical inactivity, negative psychological
characteristics, and smoking." 

"It can be calculated from this report that there are more than 200
million TV sets in American households, making the population of TV
sets similar to the population of people. Average TV viewing time is
more than four hours per day for adults and three hours per day for
children." 

Looks like people spend more time watching TV per day (21-28 hours per
week) than the average EQ player. 

Here are some stats from the CDC on Suicide:

Deaths Annually: 29,350 (year 2000)
Death Rate: 10.7 deaths per 100,000 population (year 2000)

If EQ has a subscriber base of 400K, then it would not be unusual to
see roughly 40 suicides per year among EQ players. This does *not*
mean that EQ would be the direct cause of the suicides. The #3 cause
of death among the 15-24 age demographic is suicide. Most computer
gamers fall within that age bracket.

I doubt you will see 48 hours do a report on that.
