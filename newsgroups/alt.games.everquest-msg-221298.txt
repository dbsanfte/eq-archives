We aren't trying to fix raid situations (well, some are) but
rather exp group situations; where the warrior is being passed
over for groups because he can't get and hold aggro against the
DPS classes unless they reign it in and don't use their maximum
damage output.

If the warrior could protect the casters when the mobs turn on
them, then he wouldn't need to worry so much about his inability
to hold the mob's attention.

I really don't think its a worthwhile substitute for the mobs not
turning on the casters in the first place, but it seemed like an
ability other classes don't have that might be altered to create
a real role for warriors somehow.
