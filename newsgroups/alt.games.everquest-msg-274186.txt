Oh, most likely. But if it were something with more ambiguity, such
as a word that had /no/ dictionary definition at /all/ recognized as
profane, I don't think so.

If you read my other posts, you'll note that I'm not really objecting
to his suspension. I'm objecting to the idea that the company gets
to define words in their contract after the fact.

They don't. In fact, I don't even think they could if they wrote that
they could in the contract.
