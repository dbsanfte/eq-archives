A full set of Flayed for a new necro is god-like. Are you all high?  There
is no better caster armor for other classes that costs less than about 5
K... You can get a full suit in the tunnel in a night for 300pp or less.
Plat/Velium Saphire necklace (250pp at cost), Batskull Earrings(+5 Int
each - 350pp each), Ring of the Goblin Lords(AC, Int, and str - 200pp if
that) and +4 or +5 int ring (<100pp at cost), Straw Spun Belt (10AC all all
from the Giants in FM), Polished Bone Bracer or Hollowed Bone Bracer(
<200pp), Cloak of Shadows or Lizardscale Cloak(<200pp), Frozen Mantle
(Iceclad off of lvl 30 Shadow Guardian), Shadowbound Gloves (Temple quest),
In range: Sarnak ceremonial dagger or dagger of marnek (Bottom of Befallen),
Stein of Maggok in one hand, Glowing Black Stone (lvl 14 necro in Q Hills)
in other or melee with a walrus tooth at lower levels, Polished Bone Mask on
face.
With this combo, you have a easy soloing Necro with better AC and Stats than
any caster bar none, over a 200 Int on a Erudite, and doesn't cost too much
to equip.  Short of Planes or LVL 50 and Up raids... you can't beat this.
