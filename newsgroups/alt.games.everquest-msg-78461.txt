Not sure I know what you're talking about here ... from all the
documentation I've seen, there's only one way to quest for Ghoulbane ...
that being to start in WC with the NPC, move to BB and the NPC there, go to
DC and then Najena and along they way gather up the various components in
Unrest, HHK, BB, and Najena.

Is there another way?
