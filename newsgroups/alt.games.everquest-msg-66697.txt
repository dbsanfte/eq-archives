Your chars are on their servers.

If you have a burner, burn the entire EQ dir on to a couple cds. That
is what I did when I reformated. EQ puts no stuff in the reg (at least
it didn't then, now it does with luclin but the folders seem empty..)
so you just dump the contents of the cds into a dir and just have to
patch a bit for anything newer than the last time you burned the cds. 
Oh, you also have to highlight all the files in there and turn off the
read only attrib which came from them being on cds. 

if you don't have a burner, just copy all the *.opt and *.ini files
somewhere else before  you format. *.opt are all of your characters
settings such as hot keys. Oh, you may also want to copy all *.txt
that you want to save such as your characters log files if any.
