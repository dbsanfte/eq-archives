no.  The proper quote from the article is "presumably that is in large part
because of the risk those mentors might view those children as potential
sexual objects".  This is not a policy statement from Big Brothers/Big
Sisters.  It is a supposition from one Peter Sprigg, an individual with no
affiliation whatsoever with BB/BS.

Although it has been some time since I was involved with this program
(before I had kids of my own) I remember that the orientation included
information concerning this pairing.  One of the reasons given included that
the child would be more comfortable with a same gender person.  Another
reason was that the  BB or BS was there to fill a void in the child's life
(i.e. a missing parent) and for a child who had a mom but not a dad,
matching him with an adult woman would not fill the void that matching him
with an adult man would. A third reason was that someone of the same gender
would understand the child's needs better; i.e. an adult woman would
understand a young girls first menstrual cycles better than an adult man, or
an adult man would understand a boy's changing voice better than an adult
woman -- this aspect again falls into the "void filling" aspect of BB/BS. At
no point was the possibility of sexual attraction taken into consideration.

Before you start commenting on the policies of any organization, perhaps you
should actually get the correct information from said organization, rather
than the suppositions of an outside agitator.
