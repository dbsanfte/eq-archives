/agree

Yes I will likely bitch and moan about how they are 'dumbing' down the game,
(When I was your age, all we had was a mud stained tunic and we were damn happy
to have that!) and so forth, but with the new zones in LoY and the adventures
in LDoN, I'm not going anywhere!  LOL  I really enjoy playing the game now and
am very happy they brought in these two expansions.

As for the high level guild in question here, I've never played on Drinal so I
have never dealt with them, but I think I've seen their type before.  To let a
group of idiots spoil the entire game for you is not right...  :(
