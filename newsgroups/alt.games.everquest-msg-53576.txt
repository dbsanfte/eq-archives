DOH! Well it shows how long it has been since I did that quest. At the time
I did that quest the dreadscale breastplate was broken because the large
heartsting scorpion was not spawning even though they swore up and down that
is was. =(

The gaters could be a problem but I always fear kited them and I used a MoSS
and shield and I have a well timed bash for them. =)
