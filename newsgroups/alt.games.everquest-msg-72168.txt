I don't know, I recognize the fact that MS products are constanly
being exploited, but have also found that installing a personal
firewall, and AntiVirus Software is good preventive medicine.

Microsoft has posted their fix to download using the Windows Update
feature.

Just give it time to mature, release a few Service Packs...and back up
critical data to CD, Floppy etc...Better yet- remove critical files
from the hard drive and just write them to a CDRW (man- you can get
one for what 80bucks now?).

And if you take the position: "Why should I have to go to all those
measures?"...it's simple, because you are part of a Network now and no
matter what OS you use- there are going to be exploits.

I have read a lot that 98SE still is the best for gaming...but the one
thing I HATED about 98 was no services and it sucks as a Dev Platform.
If something boggs up- you usually have to reboot.   I loved Win2k but
hated some problems with games...XP is much better than Win2k for this
reason alone.

okay...flame away if you want..
oh- and hope you all have a Good Holliday.
