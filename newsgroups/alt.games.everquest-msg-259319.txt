Hehe.  I like that "Alt-aholic".  It fits me perfectly as well.  I'm
in the same boat as you.  Same thing.  Been playin since 99.  My
"main" is level 63.  If I would have never deviated from him, I'd be
65, a million AA points and would have probably quit a long time ago,
along with all the rest of my EQ friends.  As of now, none of them
still play.

Can't stop making alts.  All 8 slots are full of characters in their
50s and 60s.  If I had more slots they'd be full of characters of
every class / race possible.  Right now it's beastlord.  Previously,
was shaman, thought I'd last but only got to level 53.  If there is a
next time, who will I choose to delete to make room?  Such a hard
decision.

I gave up trying to stick to one toon.  I just go with it now, and
keep in mind it's a game and I try to have fun.  I think I just
dislike the high-end game and the amount of time / commitment
involved, so I just keep playin the mid-range.  I also happen to like
researching / and or buying equipment / toys for every class =)

For me, there is no cure, it's terminal.  I will be doing this till
the end, my friend!
