    Also happens if nine people all /petition or /report at once. As soon as
multiple folks send a /report, the GMs know something very, very bad just
happened. (I also gather that the average person doesn't really remember to
use /report, so that queue can be fairly empty.)

    Mark's said in response that these players were Soulmarked, and that the
GM could not prove the players at zone knew what the monk was going to do.
That would explain it. Three months DOES seem steep, but I've never seen a
Soulmarked player get involved in something that may or may not have been
their fault. They usually make things pretty easy on the GMs. :-)

    GMs are human beings. If they like you, or if they're almost incoherent
with rage at the person who was in the wrong, they'll talk. I can remember
the GM on The Rathe using the public broadcast channel to summon the
leadership of Brotherhood of the Spider to discuss them training out a Fear
raid on purpose. (That incident is why they're Blood of the Spider now,
BTW - they were disguilded over that.) I've also seen GMs do bizarre things
that aren't in the CS guidelines. You'll love this example:

    Buddy and a friend are camping Hadden (yeah, a lot of good CS stories
start like this). As the pop time approaches, two paladins arrive at the
camp unseen by my buddy and friend. The paladins ask my buddy why he's at
their Hadden camp. He asks them the same thing back. The paladins claim they
were there the entire time, invisible, chatting. My friend tells them
paladins don't get invis (he being a paladin himself), and he's been there
for a half hour, it doesn't last that long. The GM is called, and arrives
with an assistant GM.

    After both sides explain their stories, the assistant GM decides to have
the two parties roll for the spawn. It'll be /random 0 385 (or some likewise
bizarre number), low roll gets the spawn. First roll, buddy gets a low roll,
other paladins roll on 0 100 then roll high. Assistant GM immediately
declares a re-roll, as the first roll was on the wrong range. Second roll,
buddy rolls high on 1 385, paladins roll low on correct range. Assistant GM
immediately declares a re-roll, not on the correct range. (I've arrived to
laugh at both sides by this point, and observed the second roll.) Third
roll, buddy rolls low, paladins roll high. Paladins begin to cheer and get
ready to take the spawn, GM asks them to leave, they say "Huh? It was LOW
roll?" and assistant GM declares a re-roll, both sides didn't know the rules
clearly.  Fourth roll, buddy rolls high, paladins roll low, paladins are
told the spawn is theirs. My buddy is a real disturber, asks for the e-mail
address of the GMs superior so he can appeal this "farcical" situation.
Poof, buddy is gone to Butcherblock to talk with the GMs.

    Here's the interesting part: the GM not only told him he was going to
get a warning for lipping the GMs, the GM bound my buddy in front of Hadden.
My buddy is a paladin, and without a Locket of Escape could NEVER have done
this himself. He was able to demonstrate (with a Translocate) that he was,
in fact, bound there. So, what part of the CS guidelines includes that? :-)
