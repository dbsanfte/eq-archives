How do I change the hotkeys in EQ1?  I've always used some of the basic
ones, sit, stand, inventory, casting stuff, etc, but now I'd like to use
some of the other ones too, but the default key is inconvenient or there is
no hotkey at all.  The reason I ask is that I'd like to be able to use the
"cycle through nearest targets" key with my chanter, but there is no default
for that so I'd have to set my own.  Up till now I've been using gnome
illusion to make myself smaller so I can get around easier, then I run
around the fight and target whatever it is I need to mez.  Wasn't a big deal
at the lower levels, but now there is more crowd controling to be done and
sometimes mobs are hard to target.
