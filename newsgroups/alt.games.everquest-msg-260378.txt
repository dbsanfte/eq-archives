I know, and I've played exclusively Humans from the day of release. 
That's what I was talking about. A better (and not horribly difficult to 
implement) way to do it would be to start off night-blind, and then 
slowly increase the gamma until a level consistent with the conditions (
moon or no moon). This could be reset again if the character walks into 
a well-lit area and then back outdoors, or is within range of a (
presumably bright) spell going off, or uses a lightsource of any kind.

I think that this would be an example of increased realism enhancing 
gameplay, rather than the opposite.
