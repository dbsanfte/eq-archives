Or it just means that he has better things to do with his time
than waiting for rezes for anyone who died and getting everything
re-organized before getting on with the, IMO, obvious "fun" of
presiding at an in-game wedding.

Let's put it this way:  if you're the GM who's had this 10 or 15
minutes of his work day reserved, aren't you just terribly happy
to have it extended to 30 or 45 minutes?   How about if you're
one of the people with a petition in the queue?  Or someone
affected by any of the other things that might have been put
off, like an event?
