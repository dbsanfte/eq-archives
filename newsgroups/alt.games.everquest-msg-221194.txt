Finally "finished" his gear. Just thought I'd post the profile now that he's
reached this stage tho - the first time in his life that I'm truly proud of
his gear. It's also an example of what can be achieved without a single raid
drop - it's all just grouping and bazaar.

Some thoughts:

* I'm a walking billboard for veksar! 7 slots filled from there.
* STA 195. +22 to go from AA's. Boar adds 60, so I figure I've got 5 +6
aug's to go before I cap it good and proper. If it weren't for LDoN I'd
probably be making sacrifices to get STA items in place - something I'm
quite glad I don't have to do!
* Next goals are:
    - Finish tanking AA's. PE next then maybe planar durability, the rest of
CA, then the planar CA/CS things. Then sta.
    - Complete Stamina Quest, get it to 305 buffed.
    - LDoN nodrop armour
    - 8th shawl maybe (FT is priceless to a class that never gets to med and
is constantly casting expensive spells I reckon)
    - Ornate plate boots maybe

A penny for your thoughts?

Cheers,
James
