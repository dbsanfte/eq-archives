I was fishing in the karanas when i saw grimfeather on track. I had just
deleted a bunch of files in order to fix file corruption as my eq game kept
crashing and my colors were back to the default, but i wasn't really worried
as I've killed him many times before. Anyway, I suddenly noticed i was being
beat up, and ran for it (sow up, should be ok). Pet died fast, then I was
next. WTF?

Then I checked the history. The Fabled Grimfeather hits you for 528 points
of damage! Ouch! Time to look for a rez :P
