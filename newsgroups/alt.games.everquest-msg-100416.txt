Hi folks, its clear from monitoring this ng over the last half year,
that many of you have experiance playing other on-line rpg's-I would
be very interested in hearing about other fantasy on-line rpg's, what
are their strenghs and weaknesses on their own, and when compared to
EQ, ect...( Anyone know anything about the new lord of the rings
one?)-also, please include (as best you know) how much it costs per
month--- I like EQ, but I don't pay in US funds so the cost is already
hard to bear (between 180-200$ per year), a price increase of 30%
pretty much eliminates EQ as a viable hobby-not flaming anyone or
trashing the game-just saying that 250$ ish a year is too much for me
to justify-I picked EQ origonally based on desriptions and ratings
from computer magazines so I'm quite open to others advice and will
move if i see an alternative-thanks for your time---Ironeyes, 34 clr,
