Another scammer trick is to inspect you, then ask to see your (whatever)
from one of your equipped slots in the trade window.  If you oblige,
when the trade is cancelled the item does not automatically equip itself,
but drops into standard inventory.

If you happen to have no empty slots capable of holding that item, it
instead drops to the ground.

Scammer is already looking down, and knows when he is about to hit
cancel... so he grabs the item first.

If you happen to have an empty slot open, well, no loss, he looks
completely innocent and can try again with someone else, or heck,
even with you later!

He can increase the odds of this happening by first giving you some
goodies, particulary interesting would be containers which -won't-
take anything big... but better would be summoned bags of summoned
food, which he can prep at the cost of nothing but mana at quite low
levels.

He can also increase his odds by asking to see several items; as
-none- will equip, he'll be filling up more slots and increasing the odds
that you'll run out this way... not to mention possibly scoring more
than one item off you!

Beating this is actually simple: either practice safe EQing and never
show anyone your gear... or make a habit of using a prophilactic:
make sure you have an open general inventory slot and only
show em one item at a time.
