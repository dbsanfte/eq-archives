Hi,

I have known about those sex things for a long time.  Mom with the
women is wierd, but when she has the big hairy guys in there, and they
do those things to her, it scares me.

I thought my Dad would do something about it, especially when I asked
him.  He usually goes in there for a while, comes out holding a towel,
and then goes to his computer room "communicate."

Why do they tie Mom up?  It leaves marks....  I ask her about it and
she just smiles....

Bye bye,

Tanya
