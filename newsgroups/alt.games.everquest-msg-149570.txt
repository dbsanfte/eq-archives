Good pp quest at around level 30 plus. The gnoll courier in Black Barrow.
After around level 17 or so you only want to go to BB if your heading to EF
or jaggedpine, but if you happen to be passing through look out for the
gnoll courier.  He's approximately level 30, hits up to about 80 dmg. and
randomly drops 1 of 4 items for the quest. The item you get is rubbish as
usual, unless fighting gnolls then it's okay.

For details check here.

I sold it to an NPC merchant in the bazaar (with 115 charisma) for 190pp. So
if I happen to see him on track he's worth the effort, and the lowbies never
complain cos they can't kill him anyway.
Don't think he spawns often, and don't know if he's got a PH or anything,
but for us tracker classes who are heading into jaggedpine to do some
fear-kiting just put Track on consider and see if he is up.
