All public references would confirm this, AFAIK.  But I do remember 
hearing of a friend creating a gnomebot and levelling up tinkering pre-16, 
and having no problems.  So it can't hurt to make a couple mechanical 
lockpicks and see if you get a skillup.  I'd try it myself, but all my 
gnomies are over 16. :)

www.eqtraders.com is a good site.  I also sometimes find www.tinkering.org 
even more helpful, though.
