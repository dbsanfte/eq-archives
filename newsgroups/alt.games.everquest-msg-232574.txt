Zebuxoruk. Probably has something to do with the SCHEDULED DOWNTIME
they announced on the eqlive website (amazing thing, you should try
visiting it now and then, especially when you have trouble logging
in):

http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/scheduled_downtime.jsp

"Scheduled Maintenance for Ayonae Ro and Zebuxoruk servers January
21st at 3am PST (-8h UTC)
On Wednesday, January 21st, at 3am Pacific, (-8:00 UTC), Ayonae Ro and
Zebuxoruk will be down for maintenance. The estimated downtime is 8
hours.
