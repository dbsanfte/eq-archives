And everybody seems to have forgotten the original 30% figure came from 
me -

And personally I would NOT care to spend the entire run at 30% mana. i 
just commented that it can be done. heck, I even did a trakanon raid 
without kei...I prefer to be about 50% with drops down to 10% if we had 
a serious thrashing [just happened this morning, got all 5 in a room on 
a pull and someone accidently got a knockback into the next room and we 
got 2 more adds. 5 is ok, 7 is not fun] and on a series of single and 
double pulls back up to about 70%. I will use my donals to top off my 
main tank after a fight rather than cast if there is 1 mob left and it 
is almost dead, say with 20 or so seconds on the mob...while others are 
rebuffing, or going to the little ranger room if we have the time left 
on the adventure. I much prefer to med up when i have the chance, and 
yaulp 5 is handy...10 mana to cast, 30 mana net after the casting cost 
in 4 tiks. Pops off quick that I can do a heal, pop it and sit down 
without losing much time. Sort of a ghetto self twitch i guess...
