Sure the original content was designed for a 6 man group, but with LoY, SoL
and even Kunark it seems abit different. Most of these camps would easily
support 8 players imho. The real problem with EQ at higher levels is the
amount of people LFG and not parties looking for more (check the LFG tool to
get a quick statistic on this).
Fact is, in the new zones you will need a slower, a healer and a tank at
minimum. This means Shaman or Enchanter, a Cleric and a Warrior/SK. So
that's about 50% of the group makeup on a standard lineup that you would
need at minimum in order to get a party rolling.
If 8 man groups where the case, then parties could have a larger mix of
classes and not be forced into having the classical lineup. 2 Sks instead of
1 warrior would easily hold aggro etc. "Ok we don't have a cleric but we do
see 2 druids LFG etc". I think 8 man groups would help solve the LFG
congestion that EQ has at higher levels, because this *is* a problem if you
check the statistics.

And as EQ used to say before "we really want to promote grouping" and that
they used to say with BIG LETTERS. They used that excuse often when they
used the nerf bat on the solo abilities of classes. What happens when you
remove the solo ability of a class, yet don't provide anything a group
needs? You go LFG and you log after an hour.
My guess is that alot more people would be online playing if 8 man groups
where allowed.
