Unfortunately the only way I have found to solve a problem like that, if it
is not the hardware, is a complete fresh install of Win2k.  I did that a
while back, after I tried DX8 with the then, latest NVidia drivers, I could
not get it to work all for EQ.  I tried going back to old drivers, in the
end, I backed everything up, reformatted, and installed Win2k fresh.  Since
then I have installed newer NVIdia drivers and DX8 (What can I say, I am a
glutton for punishment) and it works fine.  I have had too much experience
with flakiness resulting from reinstalls over an existing copy to even
attempt it anymore.  It usually means that it's weeks before my system is
configured back the way I like it with all the software I use installed on
it.  Good luck.
