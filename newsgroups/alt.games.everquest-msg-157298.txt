lol, his reminds me of last night in velks. There were 5 of us... cleric,
enchanter (me), rogue, monk, war. My chanter is lvl 57 now, so I can cast
clarity 2 and GOI for 12 mana/tic. So cleric loses his kei, and starts
spamming the zone wanting to donate for kei. We continue fighting, pulling
non-stop, chain pulling and mez parking them ready for processing )
Everything is going fine. Then said cleric decides he needs to get KEI (14
mana/tic... 2 more), so off he goes, and we have 15 mins of downtime while
he messes around trying to get down to ground (was late at night) and then
back up. So finally he gets his kei, and we continue on at the same rate as
we had with c2/goi.
/sigh
and then he decides 30 mins later he needs to leave.
