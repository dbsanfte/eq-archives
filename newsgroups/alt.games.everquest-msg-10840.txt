I don't think the two issues are related.  

The only ugly thing in AC were the NPCs, the PC avatars were crude but with
armour and such on it wasn't too bad (although I'll admit that EQ, especially
post Velious blows AC away graphically).  If AC magic wasn't so boring and
bland I'd have stayed with AC as I consider it to be a better game in many ways
(I also gave up UO because of the flat, uninteresting magic system).

From what I heard around E3, AC2 is much prettier.  I doubt they sacraficed
collision detection to get the improvement.
