Hm, the idea is to find low real blues for us. We want to duo, because we're
both fed up with the Lake Off Ill Manners everywhere, the fights over
prominenta camps that all normal pickup groups are at etc. We're willing to travel
a bit further for this.

My SK is twinked in a way that he has all STR/INT jewellry (150 STR and 110 INT,
not VERY twinked but ok), it being an iksar with a full set of dreadscale
(looked at rygorr .. not really better ... any upgrade ideas there?) and
a pretty good SK weapon (Doljonsomethingmolinar .. a 2HS axe with 33
damage, 44 delay and a 140 DD proc ... lets me nicely cast between the hits).
