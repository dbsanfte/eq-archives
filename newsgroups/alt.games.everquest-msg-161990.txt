This differs with what Sony says:

    The PC Corpse Decay Rate is as follows: If your character is
    level 10 to 60 then you have 7 days of offline or online time
    to loot your corpse. Naked corpses for characters under level
    35 decay in 3 minutes. Naked corpses for characters level 35
    and above decay in 3 hours.

It doesn't seem to matter if you're online or offline, playing or not
playing, EQIM'ing or not EQIM'ing.  You have seven days to loot your
corpse or it decays.
