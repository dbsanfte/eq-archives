Very low. 

There is a wandering guard in Qeynos hills who drops cards, guard
cheslin. I think you can be very low level and kill him (maybe around
level 12?)

Then there are some guards in West Karana who I think are for the
killing of players around level 25. They are at various towers, make
sure you consider them since some are higher level.  One of the towers
has an NPC who is for the bard epic there as well, who will assist the
guards. So scope it out first.

Other than that, there are not very many guard types in the wild who
are very killable. Gate guards/newbie guards were severely buffed at
one point.
