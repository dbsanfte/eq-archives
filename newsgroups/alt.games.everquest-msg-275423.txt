Which you can then come and harvest while the rest of are busy clearing the
fields of fungi and shrubs? Nice try! ;-)

Seriously, I did use to do as you suggest, but because I was the only one
doing it, all I got out of it was an overrunning inventory. If you don't
focus on the valuable stuff, somebody else will likely beat you to it. Of
course, if I find an isolated spot during the quiet hours, I do it, but as
soon as I see somebody else running around I change my strategy.
