This list is so funny, its the opposite of how Firiona Vie seems to work

There -is- no OOC channel, shout gets 99% of zone wide communication; 
auction is used only occaisionally

OK, this one I'll give you, nobody likes beggers on any server I've 
seen.  FV probably has the most lenient attitude towards it, though, IF 
its deeply "in character", because of the roleplay oriented environment.

> asking for payments for buffs
Definately the standard on FV; POK is filled with people standing around 
buffing "for donations", and the normal approach is to ask about the 
buff you want in shout, where upon you'll see it advertised in shout, 
you go up to them and give them money to open the trade window and get 
targetted, either to get the buff or an invite to the group for group 
buffs.  While there are a few people who buff for free, and quite a few 
who MGB for free (both announcing this fact in shout), they are far from 
the norm.

Unless you meant in a group.  No, hardly anyone does that, except about 
50% of clerics ask for peridot reimbursement out of group funds before 
the split.

As there is no FVbuff, and people do get to 65 and apparantly are in 
PoTime, these wouldn't apply either.

Hmm, so the best strategy would be to get 25, then deliberately take 
chain deaths to drop back to 24 and look for groups then, because you'll 
look hard core?

I understand what you are saying, but of course the draw of testbuff is 
the ability to test out a character who actually has many of the basic 
class abilities, which SOE thoughtfully witholds from the lower levels, 
depending on your play style it may take weeks or months to get up to 25 
the "hard way", and if you aren't sure you like a class and are on a 
limited time budget, being able to preview it like this sounds mighty 
tempting.

Maybe what you need is a testbuffed subculture within the regular test 
culture, all the people level 25-26 who got there using the command 
encouraged to group with each other, and the people who did the 1 to 24 
levels the hard way, or who worked up from 25 and are now 30 or 34 and 
seem to be sticking with it move in their own circles.

Splendid
