Why did they?

Look what PoP did to warriors, for the entire expansion.

Sure some warriors whined.. every class has vocal morons... but their whines
for an expansion of gimpness were like 1% compared to the puke from knights
for 2 months of GoD

Knights can tank GoD too. Its not easy, heck its not easy for lesser geared
warriors either, so its not like any 6k buffed warrior beats a knight in the
zone
