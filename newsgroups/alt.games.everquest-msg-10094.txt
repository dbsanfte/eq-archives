The problem with gems as currency is I can buy a sapphire from a merchant
for 116pp, I'll bet I can't sell it back to him for more than 20pp.
I can see people using this as  a money maker if you are killing MOB's that
drop valuable gems.  But not as a alternative currency.
It would be nice if EQ would put in  place a paper money system with
promissory notes or something, at the very least it would help out monks and
casters from dropping copper/silver/gold all the time.  Even if there was a
cost for it, say every 100pp the bank charges you 5pp.

just my 2cp
