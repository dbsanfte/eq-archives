Hell, if Zippy had bothered to make a salent point on the subject
rather than behaving like a semi literate moron, I could probably have
gotten behind his point.  I think Lokari, in his (her?) original post
that started all of this, was being rather anal on the whole subject
of the naming policy, but push comes to shove, he's right and the
rules support him.  This doesn't make him a nice person or somebody
I'd personally wanna play with, but that's not really the point
either.

Regardless, litningmatt has done nothing but repeatedly prove that
he's a bigger asshole than Lokari could ever hope to be.
