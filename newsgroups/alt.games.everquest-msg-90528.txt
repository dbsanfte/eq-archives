There are simple quests that can be done to get faction in SH for the
merchants (there are 4 factions there) I assume this also covers the Guild
Masters as the Druid Guild Master (a wood elf) will not train my Wood Elf
Druid as he "has no time for Wood Elves" hmmm, suppose as he (and his
ancestors) has lived on the moon all his life he is no longer a wood elf,
just a space cadet :�) I haven't bothered doing them, I just know they exist
as my guildmate spent a few hours sorting out his faction there.

As for other cities, Katta you are likely to be KoS to  (my DE warrior is
agnostic and dubious there but I have heard SK's say they are KoS in Katta)
you can improve this by killing the Vampires (Coterie) in The Tenebrous
Mountains but this will mean wrecking you faction with them (I believe
you'll be amiable to them or something) Sanctus you will definitely be KoS
in there because they have no love for Dark Elves, even nice ones like me
:�) Their background is actually a fall out with Katta over allowing Dark
Elves in. Oddly the Seru guards in Marus Seru and Dawnshrowd are not KoS to
me but those inside are.

On improving factions, other what I have said about the Coterie I haven't
looked into it, Allakhazams likely has some quests or mobs to do this, so
far I have been able to travel on Luclin pretty much unhindered by guards.
When choosing I'd suggest using a zone map to see which one of the two would
be more inconvenient to be KoS in, you can work around either but all
depends where you intend to hunt the most.
