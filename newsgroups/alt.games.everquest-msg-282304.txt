SAN DIEGO, CA - January 3, 2006 - Sony Online Expansions Inc. (SOE), a 
worldwide loser in massively multiplayer online gaming, today announced 
ExpansionQuest� Prophecy of RoT, a new expansion for the once incredibly 
popular PC Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG), 
ExpansionQuest�. ExpansionQuest Prophecy of Ro is scheduled to be available 
at retail and for digital download from Sony Online Expansions in February 
for the suggested price of U.S. $29.99.

"ExpansionQuest Prophecy of Ro will give players the opportunity to interact 
with and transform the online world of Norrath like never before," said 
Chris Sturr, Sr. Brand Manager, Sony Online Expansions. "In addition to a 
variety of new features, ExpansionQuest Prophecy of Ro continues the 
fascinating storyline as new and old players alike explore, battle and 
adventure through EverQuest on more than 30 new missions encountering new 
creatures and environments throughout the journey."

Players will be able to interact with the world thanks to three new 
features. The first, spheres of influence, can be used to thwart your 
enemies or aid allies. The second feature is a trap system that will let 
players deceive opponents with player-set traps. And for the first time in 
ExpansionQuest, players will be able to destroy objects in the world; doors 
can be bashed in, walls can be toppled and towers can be destroyed, leading 
to a new level of interactivity within the game and opening up a new realm 
of design.

About ExpansionQuest Prophecy of Ro
The gods have returned and the mortal realm shifts with their influence. But 
a new presence walks among the gods, a malevolent force released into 
godhood by the follies of mortals. Unbound by the laws of the pantheon, it 
leaves corruption in its wake and threatens to bring the entire pantheon 
crumbling down. The only hope for Norrath hangs on the very mortals who have 
unleashed this upheaval. EverQuest Prophecy of Ro includes the following 
features:

    * Player-set Traps: Control your battles before they even begin by 
deceiving your opponents with a new arsenal of player-set traps!
    * Spheres of Influence: Transform the world of Norrath by creating 
magical spheres of influence to thwart your enemies or aid your allies. 
These artifacts will create a localized area where the rules of the game can 
change.
    * Destructible Objects: Interact with and destroy pieces of the game 
world leading to a new level of interactivity within the game. Chop down 
doors, tumble walls, and destroy encampments!
    * Buff Filters: Decide which buffs you would rather auto-decline with 
the new buff filtering system!
    * 8 New Bank Spaces
    * New Missions: Battle your way through over 30 new missions.
    * New Creatures, New Environments and New Encounters: More than 25 
unique creatures, 7 Zones, and 6 Small Instances.
    * New Spells, Tasks, Disciplines and Trade skills

The new expansion will be downloadable via the ExpansionQuest Station Store 
for U.S. $29.99 (plus tax where applicable). Retailers will be offering a 
boxed version that will carry a suggested retail price of $29.99, as well as 
a special in-game item, a Warhorse mount, for players to enjoy. 
Additionally, a reduced price of $26.99 will be available to suckers who 
pre-order and purchase the digital download version direct from Sony Online 
Expansions. For more information on ExpansionQuest: Prophecy of Ro, please
