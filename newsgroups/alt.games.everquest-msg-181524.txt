no it doesn't, only hides current corpses in the zone you are in and 
only until you zone out and it NEVER hides your own corpses.  Any 
corpses made after you hide them will show up too.  I use '/hidec all' 
any time I have lag problems due to corpses.  Really makes a difference 
in newbie zones when there's a ton of newbies there getting killed.  You 
also have to do the command again when you die even if it's in the same 
zone you are bound in, that's a little annoying with a level 2 character 
who dies every 5 minutes.
