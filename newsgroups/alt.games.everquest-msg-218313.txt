I am, of course, talking about *serious* genetic issues, not minor

This really has nothing to do with anything.  Sure, any child can
accidentally contract a horrible disease or get into a grisly accident.

It has nothing to do with children who have a 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%
chance of inheriting a serious genetic ailment.

Obviously, parents who don't know about any genetic issues they have
aren't necessarily responsible for passing something onto their
offspring.
