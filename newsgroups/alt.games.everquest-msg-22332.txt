Why do judges identify with thugs who are members of a football team? The
answer is that these are the people who are seen as future leaders and
managers in America when they become adults. It will be their task to
engineer plans and issue orders to those such as they now bully, brutalize
and rape, a practice they will continue in a different guise later.

The answer is to pick up a gun and use it. That is the only way you will
get justice.

IN BRIEF / SAN BERNARDINO
Case Dismissed in Alleged Hazing Incident
  

     
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
A judge dismissed the case against a former Yucca Valley High School
football player who allegedly was involved in the sexual battery of a
teammate.

San Bernardino Superior Court Judge John Wade said Thursday that after two
weeks of testimony, prosecutors had failed to prove the charges against the
youth, now 18.

The former student, whose identity wasn't released because he was tried as
a minor, was among a group of football players accused of sexually abusing
a teammate during an alleged hazing incident at the high school last fall.
Five other juveniles charged in the case entered plea bargains.
