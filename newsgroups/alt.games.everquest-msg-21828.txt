Mostly my 51 druid is usually the poor man's cleric. You'll spend most
of your group time as the prime healer and sitting on your butt
medding for mana  so you can heal. About the only offensive spells
you'll use when your acting as a parties prime healer is snare, saving
the rest of your mana for healing. You say you've mostly soloed and
this could come back to haunt you in a dungeon not knowing how to pace
your heals so that you keep the tank standing without "chain casting"
heal and causing MoBs to agro and beat you to death. If you learned
these mistakes at a lower level, they wouldn't hurt as much when you
died from an EXP perspective.

If you have a cleric in the party, buff the tank, cast any debuffs you
have on the mob, snare, DoT, thorn shield the main tank and sit and
med. Help the cleric with healing when needed. Use DDs if the tank is
taking a lot of damage but don't chain cast these either or you'll get
agro'd on.
