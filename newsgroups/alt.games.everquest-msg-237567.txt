Nah, what happened was they decided to patch in their peek load time, on a
weekend, and the patch server could not cope with everyone coming back on at
the same time. So they decided to upgrade the patch server.

It is now a very fast 16 Mgz 286 ! It has a huge fat pipe requiring a brand
new 2400 modem!

And the main drive got a seriouse upgrade as well... all the way from its 5
1/4 inch floppy to a 20 MB drive! And they upgraded the ram to a whopping
640 KB!

This is of course is also a joke. They left it as an 8088 with a 300bps
modem.
