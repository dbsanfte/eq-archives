I found this on Morpheus.. says it's a infinite platinum guide.. but I don't
believe it.. I did find it to be a very good guide to raising your baking
skill very quickly though.. it might be what you are looking for..

Ok Everyone here it is: One of the Best Ways to Get PLAT fast!

This way of getting Plat is kind of slow but U can make 10pp every 4 min
roughly!

And guess what all U Everquesters there is NO CHANCE of getting in trouble
with Verant, Sony , No Chance of Dying or even getting Bothered!

Follow this and U will have so Much plat after a couple hours of Receptions
clicking J

Ok these First Steps takes like 1 hr max. But well worth it:

Head to EFP and get Bind (to help with time later on)

Go to Traders Holiday and buy a Spit

Then head to Arcane of Science in WFP and Go up the Stairs to Flights to a
Lady standing at the top of the Stairs with Unlimited Batwings.

Zone into EC after this and Follow the Trail to the First in go to the
Building to the Right of it and Buy Frosting.

Buy as much as you can of both.

Combine One Batwing and One Frosting in the Spit. And Sell your sack for
like a 1sp profit.

Continue to make Bat Crunchies til Skill gets to 46.

After getting skill to 46, Head back to the Inn you bought the Frosting in
and Buy Jugs of Sauce!

Gate Back to EFP if U can Or Walk there J

And Head to the Docks and Buy Fresh Fish.

Combine One Fish and one Jug to make (2) Fish Fillets ($$$ Maker)

A Stack of Fish Fillets Sell for 1 pp 1 gp or maybe more Depending on CHA.

Continue to Make Fish Fillets til Skill gets to 82

After Skill is at 82 U need to Master your Baking skill so your Fish Days
will be 99% good.

Buy some Bat wings again In the Arcane of Science and Some more Fish and
Combine one Fish and One Batwing to make Fish Cakes

Continue this skill is at 135!
