At 15, you are probably too small for this dungeon.

The new "a skeleton"s range from level 25 to 29. There are four spawns,
one right at the entrance, one at the cubicle at the end of the right
fork past the ogre guards, one next to the elemental room about the same
distance on the left fork, and another in the dead end freezer room. I
went from level 24 to 29 hunting these things with my partner troll
warrior, who went from 34 to 37.

During the week or so I was in Najena, there were several lower level
shadowknights and paladins around level 18 taking on the large and
greater skeletons, and the occassional ogre guard. 

I hope this helps a little, without discouraging you horribly. I really
think that by adding these particular skeles to Najena that they have
made the dungeon impossible for high teens to enjoy this dungeon, unless
someone is hunting them.
