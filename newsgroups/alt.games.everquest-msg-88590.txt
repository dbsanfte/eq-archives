This is from caster's realm. All of these creation guy stat things are
paraphrases of when Brad McQuaid, the games head honcho, Came out and
said what each stat does because there were so many rumors.


"Charisma: This affects amount you will be paid for goods by NPC
merchants, and how much they will pay you.  It also affects the saving
throw on certain Bard and Enchanter spells (charms in particular). "

That was pretty much what he said, the rest of it is caster's realm


" There is much debate over the true importance of Charisma for
enchanters.  It seems that the truly defining element which impacts on
charm durations, mesmerise resists and other supposedly "charisma"
based spells is actually the targets Magic Resistance.  Some people
claim that it makes a large difference.  Studies run at Casters Realm
have been inconclusive, so you may choose to say "better safe than
sorry" and add some points at creation."

What McQuaid said was it only affects their saving throw against the
charm. 

That is surmised to mean the higher the enchanter or bard's charisma,
the higher the mob would have to "roll" to resist. Of course so many
other factors such as resistence, level vs level etc come into play.
As they say having it can't hurt. Most high level enchanters I know
just in getting good enchanter stuff end up with around close to 200
charisma and over 200 int. Most bards I know don't seem as concerned
about getting charisma high, which never seems to hurt them.

Charisma has nothing to do with fear.
