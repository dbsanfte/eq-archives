My druid was master looter last night - she *was* the logical person to do it
in our group.  I've never done it before.  Not Fun.  I rarely got to sit down:
damage shield tanks, snare mobs, run back to previous room loot bodies, run
back to group.  I had full mana most of the time but no time to nuke.  When the
healer ran out of mana is when I really had trouble because I was main healer
for a few rounds.  Thank goodness I had KEI.
I won't ever offer to do it again :)
