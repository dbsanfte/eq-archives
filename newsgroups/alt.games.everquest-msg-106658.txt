  Non-conventional groups can work really well sometimes.  Playing on
Firiona Vie with the low population and grouping restrictions, a lot of
times you have to take what you can get even if it's not what people usually
come to think of as an optimal group.

  A couple weeks ago, it was myself (level 34 shadow knight at the time), a
level 38 necromancer, and a level 24 beastlord in the Overthere.  We were
killing mobs that conned deep blue, even or yellow to me one after another,
with short rest breaks after every 3 kills or so.  The experience was quite
good.  The beastlord gained an entire level (almost 5 full yellow bubbles)
in a couple hours.  I was also making good experience, and the necromancer
was making good progress as well.  In the beginning only the beastlord and I
were grouped, and simply traded kills with the necromancer.  It worked
fine... on some kills, the necromancer was reporting half a blue bubble per
kill, and I was seeing similar progress, and I think the beastlord was doing
even better than we were.

  The next evening, it was myself, another shadow knight slightly above me
in level, the same necromancer, and a level 35ish wizard.  We were fighting
Feerrott lizardmen... we pretty much straight tanked the lizards and we were
able to chew through them fast enough that they didn't do too much more
damage than what we could heal ourselves with lifetaps.  Everybody was very
happy about the experience we were getting.

  Below level 40 at least, you can go a long way without a healer, enchanter
or bard against the rght mobs or in the right area.  It can be fun making it
work.
