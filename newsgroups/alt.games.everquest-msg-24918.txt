Lokari, I'm shocked!!

Actually:  excellent job!

What you probably burned into his long-term memory is exactly what /d stands
for.  A lesson well earned and learned.

This 'asking others for boons' issue is intriguing to me.  I have been so
independent, very much a loner (just me and Ellie, my Pet).  I have oft felt
the desire to run faster or memorize more quickly and realize that I *could*
ask for such blessings.

Still...  I hesitate.

What would *you* say, if you were going to be Anne Landers of Norrath, is
the most agreeable manner in which to request a boon?  Should one send a
private Tell?  I cannot bring myself to Shout; the only time my voice is
raised publically is for an occasional auction of my tailored goods (many
thanks for your guidance, btw) or when a Yell is wrenched from my dying
lips.

My thanks.

Dalavidu of Luclin
Mage 16th
