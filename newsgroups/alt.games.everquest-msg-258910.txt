Hi, 
  I have two computers.  Both are 1.5G Pentium machines with
Kensington Expert Mouse Trackball for their mouse.  (both are
identical)  The only difference between these two computers is the
operating system.  One is Win2K and the other is WinME.  The tracball 
on the Win2K machine behaves very well.  A single sweep and the
pointer easily goes from one side of the screen to the other.  The
WinME machine is a completely different story.  It takes 4 or 5 swipes
to move the pointer from one side to the other.  This is in game with
the same character even.  The accelleration settings for the WinME 
machine don't make a difference.
  Is there any game setting (not counting the one in the pop-up window
in game) that I can tweek to change the sensitivity of this mouse?
  I have other reasons for keeping the two different os's so that not
a solution, btw.

thanks,

Robert
