    What Sang said. You may want to look closer at the mana bar - you may be
experiencing some goofy graphics thing where the mana bar looks "almost"
full but really isn't. Or, there may be a slightly broken assumption here -
is Cel Heal holding his HPs roughly level over the duration? If so, you're
using the slight slippage in his HPs every time you recast as a "buffer",
and that's where the apparent gain in efficiency is coming from. After the
fight, when you have to heal him up to full, you'll see exactly how much
mana your method is costing versus Complete Healing.
