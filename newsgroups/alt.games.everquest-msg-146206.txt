Taken from something that was taken from something, etc. Thank you whomever
the original author was- you are gifted.

Please note: There are a lot of changes going into the game with today's
patch. Some of these changes (such as the changes to resistances and spell
stacking) will effect stuff that we have no idea how it worked in the first
place. Keep this in mind when you log in and don't bother us. K? Thx! With
system-wide changes like these it is entirely possible that there are still
bugs, in fact...we can say for certain that we screwed up lots of stuff!
Please just s.t.f.u and deal
with it. Not like there is any other game you can play. Suckers.

---------
Petitions
---------

/viewpetition displays the petition you have in the queue, and we know you
do because you guys whine a LOT.

/deletepetition deletes the petition you have in the queue, if any (unless
that petition is currently being viewed by CS staff). We like

this new command. Next patch we will give you a command to delete other
peoples petitions as well! We are looking into making a hotkey that

will let you randomly blow away petitions on servers you don't even play on
as well.

--------
Keyrings
--------

We will be resetting all keyrings with this patch. We HAD the key rings
working how we wanted, but you whiners didn't like our idea of having

to get a key every time you wanted to go after the phat lewtz. If you had a
key that you lost, do a petition, then a /deletepetition and then go get
another key. Losers.

------------------
Experience Changes
------------------

We have smoothed out level progression from 50-60. This should mitigate the
"penalty effect" that occurs in levels 51, 54 and 59 and pretty much annoy
anyone that had to go through these Hell Levels before we decided to fix it.
Note that it will cost the same experience to level from 50 to 60 as it did
before, but by using the new Verant Extra Special Experiance Formula, you
will need to kill twice as many blue mobs to get the same experiance that
you needed before. MUHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHA! BOW, PEONS! KISS THE FILTHY FEET
OF THE EXP GOD! Also, death experience loss will appear different in some
levels. Now when you die, a GM will appear and laugh at you. We have
assigned about 00 "Laughing GMs" per server to facilitate this. *NOTE* These
GMs will NOT answer a petition or a question. Sending a "Laughing GM" a
/tell will result in your banning, your friends banning, and having a Verant
Ghestapo member comming to your house and smashing your computer.

We have rebalanced the rewards for killing NPCs for characters over level
50. NPCs that are considerably weaker than you will give you less
experience. NPCs give more experience the higher level they are, and for the
best results you should fight the most challenging monsters you can
reasonably manage. If you believe this please call us. We have several
bridges for sale we would like to discuss with you.

------
Spells
------

Gonzo the Chimp has been WAY busy on his Apple IIe working on spells.

Too bad none us speak "Chimp" or we would tell you what has changed.

Find out and tell us and you will get one free petition!

Whispers in the taverns of Katta Castellum speak of recently discovered
Ancient melodies. Ted Nugget will be making a special guest apperance in the
EC Tunnel to discuss 'Why Bards are Always Broken'.

Higher level PCs will be more resistant to lower level NPCs' spells.

This means that the annoying Lvl 5 Gnoll Shaman in Blackburrow will still
cast on you even if your Level 60, still land his spell, but you should feel
good about it since we know all about it and are laughing at you.

Increased the number of spells that can be in effect on a given NPC to 30.
Raised the NPC resists to 1 million kajillion.


----------------------
Spell Stacking Changes
----------------------

Spells now stack like pancakes from IHOP, instead of like playing cards.
This was an important change, as pancakes are more yummy.

------------------
Resistance Changes
------------------

We've made some fairly drastic changes to the way the spell resistance
system works. Previously, there was only the smallest benefit to having
resists over a certain value. We've reworked resistance in its entirety,
completely replacing the old system with one that is more logical:

There is now a Secret Button Combo that you must type BEFORE the NPC Spell
lands on you! To receive your 20 diget Secret Resist Code, we will tell it
to you for $50. You Secret Code is only good for 30 days, so be sure to
renew your Secret Resist Code when it runs out!The idea behind the changes
is pretty simple: Resists should matter if your rich.

For spells that require Line of Sight (LoS), the LoS check is now at the
beginning of the spellcast, not the end. Spells that require but do not have
of LoS will now fail immediately.

Harmful spells require LoS. Unless your an NPC. If your an NPC, you can now
cast harmful spells on people two zones away.

--------------
Priest Changes
--------------

We gave clerics a lot of usless junk, but we are laughing to hard to write
it down.

---------------
Sound and Music
---------------
After 3 years of listening to you jerks whine, we have decided to use a new
music and sound system. We were lucky enough to be able to liscense the
Atari 2600 Sound Engine for like two bucks! As soon as we can find a way to
bolt it onto our new Wolfenstine 3D Engine, we'll roll it out.

-----
Items
-----

Items now display level-restricted statistics besides armor class and damage
as a red number with the unrestricted value in parentheses. Now you can see
without a doubt that all those uber Stone Tipped Spears and stuff from CT
REALLY ARE for Lvl 35+.

--------------
User Interface
--------------

Deleting Spells from Spellbook: We thought it was pretty cool that you guys
could lose items, so we thought it would be even FUNNIER if you could lose
spells! We are eagerly awaiting to see how bad we botched this.

Please note: This does not convert the spell back into a scroll. You will
have to buy a new scroll if you wish to re-scribe the spell. No
reimbursements will be made for deleted spells.

Fixed a bug that sometimes caused a crash when zoning with the corpse window
open. Now you just crash all the time.

There will now be sound when banking coins. This was a top priority! We are
sorry for the inconvienence this may have caused.

----
Misc
----

The Help window will now be displayed on startup. This will happen only if
it has never been seen before (since this change). You will need to enter a
valid Credit Card number when this pops up.
