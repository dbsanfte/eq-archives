Ever notice people prefer certain races? I know someone with a
halfling druid, halfling warrior and halfling rogue. I have a DE
necro, warrior (wished i would made it ogre but considering the name i
gave her it was for roleplay reasons), rogue and wizard. Guess I just
got used to neriak, nektulos and the freeport area. I made a druid and
promptly ran her from qeynos to freeport. Same old area again. Then I
made a gnome mage. ACK! Lost in a new city. Drop gnome mage and make a
human in freeport. Ahh...thats better.

Some people stick to same class, race and location.

Even now....there are some cities I havent been in and some fairly low
level locations I havent seen (chessboard comes to mind)
