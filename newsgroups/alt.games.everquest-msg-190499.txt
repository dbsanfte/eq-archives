A few essential things to good plvling:
1) a good source of healing.
2) a way to do damage that doesn't count against the damage done by the 
plvlee.  failing that, a way to negate the damage done by any party doing 
damage that counts against the plvlee's damage.
3) buffs that take the plvlee's HP total way beyond what they should 
normally have.
4) don't be an asshole.  if someone comes along that needs the camp more 
than you (ie: they're not being plvl'd and aren't twinked), share the 
camp.   This will help people to not hate you.
5) have a very good grasp of the crowd control methods available to you.
6) KEI is very helpful.

In order of importance: 4, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6.

As a side note: paladins lack any form of #2 that I've ever heard of.  
And at low levels they don't exactly have #1 covered either.

Good luck,
