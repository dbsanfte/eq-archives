Nope Im not wrong and Sony's layers agree with me not you. I defer to
the obvious that they know way more about the law than you or I. 

There are some things we can see from the lack of action on Sony's
part. If there was a hint of copywrite violation Sony would be all
over it, they arent.  EULA is not a contract it cannot be witnessed or
even proven I ever saw the screen or that I agreed to anything, recent
cases on the "click to continue" type of "contracts" support this view
as much as oppose it. The only times its ever even an issue is when
copywrite or other laws are violated. As for the plat schemes  think
you confuse a sense of fair play with legalities. Fraud is a complete
shot in the dark, for one you would have to show how Sony was the
victim since they own it all. Which is stated very clearly in hehe the
EULA. As for somehow robbing Sony of the use of its property well ever
destroyed any copper? See how inane this gets?

Case dismissed....meanwhile plat is still for sale and will continue
to be for the life of the game. Buyer beware.
