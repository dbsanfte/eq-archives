	For a long time, the Runed Oak was the best bow in the game.  That changed
when Wind Sabers started dropping, though they were Ranger-only, and it
changed for all Archery classes when the Bow of the Underfoot started
dropping.  Nowadays, a fletcher can make a Shadewood bow that's better, and
the WE cultural is miles ahead.  You would probably have to pay someone to
take a Runed Oak from you.
