Well I logged in a few hours later to find out whether my friend was
in huge trouble for killing this mob or not, and he was grouped with
the GL so I guess they worked everything out, although he was very
close-mouthed about it, so I still don't know exactly what the GL's
opinion of this whole thing was :/

But thanks for letting me know that.  If it weren't for the fact that
technically I'm not supposed to know who's in trouble for what, I'd
send that mage such a /tell...

Ryou
