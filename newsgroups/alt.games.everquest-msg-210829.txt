Seems to me a lot of shamans these days get stuck on the tear from PoF.
Getting it is nowhere near easy unless you're in a guild that raids PoF.
I'm in a pretty new guild and we did a lot of the old content in the
beginning and everytime we did CT there was always nonguilded people
begging to come along and loot it.
Rest of it is cake though.
