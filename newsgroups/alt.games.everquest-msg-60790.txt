*In general*, I'd never experienced that sort of problem stemming from
my SBLive. Emphasis because recently I had all sorts of bizarre
crashes which first manifested in-game, but soon were occurring all
over.

Did the usual virus scans - nothing found (I've been involved in
online computer activities since 1986 or so, and have *never* had a
virus). Starting wiggling components, pulling boards, uninstalling
drivers. Took a long time to get all the SBLive junk cleaned out of
the registry, but the system seems stable now. Seems.

I briefly had a no-frills stereo only cheapo sound card, and it was
the best performer with EQ/Win2k. Even so, it wasn't great.

I currently have a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz, which performs splendidly
under DAoC, but is almost as bad as the SBLive under EQ.

Call me a cynic, but I think the only decent solution for EQ under
Win2k is to just play without sound, which is what I've been doing for
a year now.
