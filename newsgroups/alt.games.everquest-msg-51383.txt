Howdy all.

Well, we took the plunge and bought a couple of copies of EQ (the Trilogy)
and are giving it a whirl...we're enjoying it pretty well (the wife and I)
but I've got a few questions, maybe someone can help me out here.

I'm running Win2k/sp2 w/latest (not beta) DX8.1; when I click on Options and
then on the Screen Resolution to try and crank it up past 640x480, my system
*reboots*.  I mean, turns itself off and back on again..!  I've got a
GeForce2 MX (32meg), latest detonator drivers.  Anyone else suffering this
problem?!

Last night's session was lots of fun; met a couple of friends who've been
playing longer than we have, so they showed us around, helped us get some XP
and make 3rd level before bedtime (thanks Sean, thanks Krystal), which was
cool.  What was NOT cool was when we were standing near the Orc village and
got "trained" by some bozo - according to Hitomichan, after we were killed,
this individual did the same thing to lots of other people...great.  Guess
even in non-pvp there are idiots.

Finally, I notice what seems like a lot of playing the mechanic of the game
but not the actual spirit of the game; that is, people don't seem to get
into RPing that much, rather they seem to play the game more as an excercise
in number-crunching and item acquisition.  Is this incorrect?  Did I just
run into the wrong bunch of folks or what?

TTFN, gonna give it a try later today.
