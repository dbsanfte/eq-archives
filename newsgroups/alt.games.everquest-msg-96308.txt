Ick.  That'll be worse than the "invasion of the half-elf twinkie
paladins" a couple years back when the d00ds decided they looked cool.
Or the "invasion of the gnome necromancers" before that when some online
guide pronounced gnome necros the most powerful class in the game.  It
won't add variety so much as it'll add a slew of halfling twinkies whose
primary effect, other than being annoying, will be to drive up the cost
of certain twink gear for a while.  Of course, these same prices will
crash shortly afterwards when they get tired of their new toys and the
cry is raised:
"/auc selling everything on me at [platform below bank|first torch]".
