Interesting...  However, being that you are a Level 30 Druid...  You
haven't seem to suffer enough of being a druid.

Currently, running a 54th level Wood Elf Druid...  Trying to grind away at
experience in Everfrost (Yes, I know, there are much better XP places to
solo), I constantly hear, "I need a port to such and such..." "Can you buff
me?" "Can you sow me?" "Can you heal me?"  in OOC and in say as well as
shouts.  I don't answer them because I am medding up for my next Ice Giant
pull.  One of my earlier rants was about how a lowbie Barbarian Rogue who
called me a "tigt wad" for refusing to camo her and sow her to have her try
and get past the ice goblins inside permafrost.  And also the fact how I
loathe to buff people who treat campers or people soloing in areas as their
own private buffing/healing station, stating it is all just a game.

For a person who has become a 30th level Druid, you seem very naive about
the life of a druid.  Players who play druids are not arrogant, and the
fact that the 3 people you mentioned, no mentioning of how long you spent
time asking there or waiting, you neglect to take into consideration that
in EC Tunnel, Spam central, where people try to sell items, it is possible
to lose tells in the sea of spam, or, like in my case, looking at another
screen for information of items, 20 lines go by while I look up something.

At my level, I turn away people who ask for ports and such, even put in my
own bio that I am Anon for a reason.  I only buff fellow grinders, like
Necros and Shamans working the IGs, cause I know why they need that Skin of
Nature or Regrowth Regen spell.  Reason for doing so is because I have a
small window in order to do something, and I try to capitalize it as much
as I can.  While money is good for porting, it doesn't gain me the XP I
need to go to the next level.  And while I can also be a philanthropic
person about porting without charging, I am spending time I could be
grinding away to get XP in that small window of time porting people and
medding up, but I also have to pay for tradeskills and gear/spell upgrades,
hard to do so when you aren't grinding away to make XP or Money in the
process.

People in the tunnel, spending their time to sell items, yes, they are
there of their own free will as well.  Thing is, they may be talking to
another person or doing a trade or as someone suggested, AFK or looking
away while doing something.  It has nothing to do with druids being
arrogant, its called players being human.
