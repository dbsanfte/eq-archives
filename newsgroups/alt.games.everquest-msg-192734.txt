    I don't mean to discourage you more, but this is A Known Bug. If you go
LD while charmed, you can get stuck in world and get 1018 errors until the
server goes down, the zone crashes, or a GM manually removes you. I wish you
the best of luck with a speedy resolution of your problem, and I shake my
virtual fist at a system that allows someone to be stuck without the ability
to play for two days when it takes less than ten minutes for a GM to free
you up.
