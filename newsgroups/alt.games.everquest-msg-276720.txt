Google's probably the best place to look, really.  It's amazing how
many questions can be answered by checking Google.  Anaglyph is what
the red-blue filter method of 3D imaging is called.

Yes, all of the above.  In anaglyph mode, it splits the 3D rendered
image into two overlaid displays: one blue, one red; both contain equal
ammounts of the green channel to allow for full color.  Wearing the
glasses ensures that each eye gets a seperate image, allowing you to
utilize the full resolution of your screen.  Other supported modes are
varying types of page-flipping, used in the afore-mentioned rapid
cycling between which eye can see and which one cannot with polarized
lenses, lenticular displays like what modern holographic LCD monitors
use, and head-mounted displays like VR goggles.

Hope this gets you started on the right track.  And before you ask,
lenticular is where a prism or other similar apparatus bends light such
that only one eye sees the image; this is most commonly used in 3D
wiggle-pictures, like what used to be found in CrackerJacks, and has
recently been applied to LCD displays for 3D viewing.  A crappy
lenticula 3D monitor can go for a few hundred, a decent one will run
you $4K

Xiphos - I also highly recommend dictionary.reference.com as a good
resource.  No, really, it's a great place.  I look stuff up there all
the time.
