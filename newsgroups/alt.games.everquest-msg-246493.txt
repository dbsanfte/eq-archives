I would have thought the same thing. All my toons have bind wound as far up
as I can get it. What's amazing is how many melee'rs I've run with who DON'T
have their bind wound up. I tell them they might want to start binding their
wounds and get themselves up to 50% at least (when it was 50%) while I med
up and I'd heal them the rest of the way and they say they can't. They
either don't have band aids or they don't have the skill. *boggle*.
