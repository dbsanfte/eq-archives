12 seconds per the patch message.   3 min recharge.

Aye.   I guess you could make a text macro hotkey to use it on the
enchanter... but still by the time you know they need it...

Can't use it as in it won't activate?

The patch message just says that defensive and other disciplines won't
reduce damage from it.

They're going to make it longer... but you have to spend Planar AA to do it.
I think it was something like +10 sec per purchased level.

Only one I can see is the one you outlined above.   X god does so much
damage that you need to split the damage constantly.

Perhaps use it a bit like a warrior Lay Hands... see the MT is low on
