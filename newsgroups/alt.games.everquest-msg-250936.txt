I know you can buy gamecards online... like here:
http://www.electronicsboutique.com/ebx/product/206855.asp

I better route for higher level players is to buy gamecards IN GAME with pp.
See lots of euro people doing that... people in north america buy them in
real life and sell the code in game.  Usually around 30k to 50k.
