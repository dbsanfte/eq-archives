I have been getting a 1017 error for over 6 days constantly now. I have
tried 3 different ISP's and 2 different PC's.
The Tech support tell me to try again later. I am getting really pissed off
having to wait for a week before I can get any help. I got onto the Tech
support chat again and they told me to get lost and play something else.
What sort of shitty customer service is that? When I asked them who I
complain to they said no-one, just be patient and put up with it.
I have been pretty patient up until now, but just cant believe their
attituded to customers when they have such a great game. I have also e-mail
Verant Tech support but apart from an automated e-mail to say they have got
mine, I never get a reply from them.
If anybody has any ideas if there is anything I can do from my end to fix a
1017 error.
Any help will be appreciated.

regards
Dave
