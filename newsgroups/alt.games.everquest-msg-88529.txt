I have done that quest three times - only once did I successfully leave with
the Stein.

1) When I go as a Dark Elf (illusion), and cast Alliance, I had good enough
faction to succeed with Clurg, but as a Troll, even with the Benevolence
spell (+200 faction), he just took the book and said I was an enemy and to
go away. I had conned him before as dubious, but figured +200 faction would
have to get me to indifferent or better - but it didn't and I didn't
re-check the con.

I always worry about the illusion suddenly fading, so I always feel rushed
once I am mired in the Ogre kingdom - if I pop up as an erudite, I'm a
gonner.

Also remember Invis stays with you when you zone, but your illusion doesn't
(found that out the hard way on quest #1)

ALSO, being the moron that I am, when I did successfully manage all the
dopey requirements and intricacies of this quest and got to Clurg, with good
faction as a Dark Elf, I had forgot not to bring my first Stein and since it
is a Lore Item  ---  he thanked me, gave me XP, but no 2nd lore item   Do's.

Anyway - it is a frustrating quest, but I now have a written plan, I follow
very closely, so I get to all the weird lands to get the weird items in
order to get the Compendium of Drinks, and the travel guide to get to the
Feerot and Oggok without getting greased, and the spells I need on and in
memory for the trip into Oggok and the exchange (and not to bring my first
stein!)

I suggest anyone attempting this quest REALLY think it out, otherwise it can
produce bactracking, extra time and expense, death and frustration.
