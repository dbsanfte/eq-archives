I was playing in Crushbone tonight with my lvl 10 (yes I undinged for
thos following my exploits) Warrior, and ran into a friend of mine
from WAY back when, who was now playing a lvl 65 (cleric I believe). 
Anyways she was kind enough to cast temp on me and then she left. 
Being slow, I saw a lvl 11 bard LFG as the only other player in CB at
the time so we grouped.

After a while I looked at my HP and had something on the order of 1100
or so HP, so I decided to try something suicidal, and me and the bard
went in to take the Throne Room.

We managed to get ALL the way in and eventually killed Emporer Crush,
and here is how we did it.

When we first got in the Throne room, we were aggroed by EVERTHING in
it.
I ummm accidently jumped out the window after my HP dropped to 50%,
the bard stayed inside like a trooper and promptly died.  Right after
I fell out of the window, the Oracle and a Royal Guard jumped out of
it too, but for some reason the others stayed inside.

So while the bard was busy running back to CB from Kelethin, I happily
whacked away at the oracle.  By the time I dropped the Oracle, the
bard let me know he was back in CB so I told him, screw his body for a
moment and come help me with the Royal.  He did as he was told, but
with no weapon the best he could do was sing the heal song.

I was down to maybe 25% of my HP when I started the fight with the
Royal, and when the bard came, I was at 20% or so.  But when the fight
with the royal guard was over I had 30% of my HP remaining.  So I sat
my plump little butt down for a few minutes, and soon I had full hp
again.  (To be fair the Royal may not have gotten in alot of hits
since I do have a Targ shield and my bash is maxed out so he spent
alot of time stunned or something cuz he wasn't swinging at me much)

Then we went to go get the bards corpse.  We were aggroed by 3 cents
and a lego, but I kept them taunted off the bard while he happily
looted his corpse.

By the time he had his corpse looted, I was at about 75% of my HP, and
told him to start the healing song.  By the time the fight was over I
still had over 80% of my HP left.  So I told him, to play cleric, sit
down with whatever he needed to to increase that song, and we went
behind the throne.

I'll give ya 2 guesses as to who was hiding behind the throne... It
was good ole emporer crush.  He was a VERY dark red to me and he hit
like he wanted me to die soon.  I believe he took about 90% of my HP
before I was able to finish the fight.  But I did, he dropped like a
stone, the fight lasted longer than any I ever remember, but lemme
tell ya, when my little lvl 12(by then I believe) Halfling warrior,
sent that final chop into Crushs knee cap, well I think I cried a
little.

I sat down, and told the bard to keep signing and he could loot up the
entire zone, everything we had killed, I just wanted to sit for a
minute...

I went AFK for a moment, to grab some coffee, when I came back I was
sitting in Misty Thicket.  My temp had dropped, and I was nekkid. 
Yup, folks I was killed by a cent while I was sitting there AFK.
