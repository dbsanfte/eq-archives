Anyone else notice the bard/enchanter nerf to Velks Lab?  Previous to
the patch Monday, bards and enchanters could sing/cast a faction spell
and become dubious to all mobs in Velks Lab.  Now faction stays KoS,
which makes CR in certain areas pretty much impossible without a necro
to summon corpse. 
I petitioned, and the GM I spoke with agreed that there was nothing in
the patch message to indicate that this was planned, and suggested
that I submit a /bug, which I did.  I've also been asking any bard or
enchanter I see in the zone to do the same thing.  This probably isn't
a big deal, unless you are a bard/enchanter who actually liked being
able to explore a dungeon and go places where even monks fear to
tread.
