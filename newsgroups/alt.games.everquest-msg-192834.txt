Today's patch didn't fix the pet problem.  My pet just attacked the
Druid I was grouped with for the fifth time in 3 days.  Everything was
fine for about 3 hours of play time & then the pet started attacking
the Druid for no reason.  I reported the bug today just like I did
yesterday.  In a way, it's kinda nice to hear that other people are
having the same problem.  I was starting to think that I was the only
one.
