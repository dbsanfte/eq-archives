Sale of in-game items seems dicey to me.  esp if Sony is taking a percentage
of the sale (and you know they would!)

lets see - for a demonstration, let's say Sony takes 1% of selling price as
profit markup.  (this would be cheap)

Lammy's start by selling at $25.

Sony see's that there is interest in this item, so...

They reduce the drop rate a bit and raise the price to $35.

people still buy them, esp since they are getting more expensive in the
bazaar - harder to find.

Sony reduces the drop rate even more... and increases the tribute value...

raise the price to $50...

<rinse, repeat>

very dangerous.
