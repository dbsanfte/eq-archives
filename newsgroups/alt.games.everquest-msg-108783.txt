On the roof, there's an NPC that can be triggered by a command phrase
to another NPC somewhere down below. L30 or so I think. It is
basically non stop killing, as fast as you can kill.

It sounds better than it is. It is exceedingly mindnumbing for anyone
but the melees. You also don't maintain your skills, both in a game
sense (all you ever use is evocation) and in a real sense (there's no
chance for adds or anything, no need in playing smart).

I couldn't stand it for more than an hour but some have gone from
25-40 there.

Oh one other thing it hoses kelethin rogue guild faction, I believe
that includes the banker.
