    We used to kill the Paffa event with 2 clerics and 2 necromancers with
charmed undead. Even with the charm nerf, should be more than doable with
two added people (extra necro/cleric, maybe a bard instead of the third
cleric, /shrug), as it relies on AA's and spells more than it does gear.
Here's some of his drops (the ones that people who'd do this want):

    CoD has no flag limits to enter if you are of sufficient level. I can
name other No Drop stuff that a single Bazaar-level group could obtain, but
I'd need to know more about what you consider to be "kinda uber". Would
those two items I linked (FT 2 caster mask and an Affliction Efficiency IV
NEC earring) qualify?
