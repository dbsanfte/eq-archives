It seems to be random whether it will revert back or not.  The fix is
coming in the big patch sometime in the beginning of January.  One
thing I have noticed is that since creating another chat window  (third
total), the second one is always the correct way now when I log back
in.  Maybe you can get around the annoyance by making another window,
and just shrinking it down and stick it somewhere unobtrusive.  That
way the one you care about isn't reverted back to default.
