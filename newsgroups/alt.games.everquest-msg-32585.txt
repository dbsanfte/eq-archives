My Ranger bumped into Bilge the other day on his way to a kedge raid.
Killed him and he dropped the PKT (Pear Kedge Totem 18!wis -9str)
Since i can't use it i want to sell it, problem is i don't know what i
should
ask for it, i have seen these go for more then 20k but that was 6 months ago
and with prices dropping so incredably on all items lately i have no clue
what
they are worth today.
Sites like Eqprices,Alla etc dont seem to help much cause that have huge
diferences in prices and very little reports , most of it being not very
recent.

So in short does anyone know what i could ask for it?

Yindain,
lvl 45 Ranger on Xev

Or even shorter: PC on PKT =)
