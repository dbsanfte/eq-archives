Excellent advice, except that in my experience Hadden's spawn
time is more like 5:30-5:45 (hours:minutes) instead of six
hours.  He's slightly variable (all long-spawns seem to be),
and he himself spawns every time, no placeholders, thank
goodness.

He spawns right by the campfire in front of the little hut
with the guy in it, just south along the shoer from the
enchanter who wants the rat ears.
