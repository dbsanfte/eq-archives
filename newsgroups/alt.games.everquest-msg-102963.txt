See above.  Obviously you're lucky enough not to have known any severe
alcoholics.  Or perhaps you're just in denial?

The alcohol equivalent of "the patch" would be "drinking a little less
each day".  Guess what--it's hard to do.

The above paragraph simply beggars belief.  Ever talked to the
homeless people on the streets of a major city?  Are you aware of the
proportion of auto accidents that are alcohol-related?

Just because most people who drink know when to stop doesn't mean that
it isn't physically addictive in sufficient quantity, and a slow poison.

Did you pay attention in high school health class?  Or were you out
drinking in the parking lot?
