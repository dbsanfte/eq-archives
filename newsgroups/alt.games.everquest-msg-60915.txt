Everquest quests are 99% bullshit. They aren't worth the hassle or danger.
Usually, you always have better items than any quest you can complete, so
its a real waste of time. Really gay. Go camp some MOB instead, as that is
usually the only thing worth doing in EQ.
You should use somekind of invisibility to solo explore places safely.
Ofcourse some zones are dangerous, even to high level chars, so there's a
risk for everyone.
