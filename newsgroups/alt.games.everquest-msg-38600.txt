The Sk can for most things really, or small groups. Nothing will beat
the warrior as the needed tank in the uber game such as tanking the
really big mobs. Its not just the combat skills, but the Warrior gets
the highest AC stuff overall.

Sk is better than the warrior in many ways though, such as being able
to solo all the way up to 60.. having a lot more spells that make it
able to get around on its own and such. I find it a much more fun
character to play overall. If you have a cleric friend or friends
pasted to you 24/7, a warrior is great, otherwise its a struggle I
think. A warrior needs a group, eventually always.

If you really want to be a high level kick butt one, be an ogre and
make agil at least 75, raise sta and probably str some (int doesn't
really matter at all, frankly, you are a melee type tank first almost
and a caster second... plus lots of stuff adds int you wear/use such
as MOSS, etc) Ogre can't be stunned from the front and does end up
with more HP when high. Starting with 150 str will make you feel you
don't need to get many str things and concentrate on AC more instead.

I've heard tons of DEF and human sks say they wish they'd gone ogre
when they were level 55 or 60, yet never heard one ogre say the
reverse ;)

Again, you can tank all but the highest mobs in the game as well as a
warrior nearly but when you were in some uber guild doing those
highest mobs you'd have plenty of warriors to tank anyway, and you
will certainly be welcome as well.
