Let me see. My druid went from Oasis 16 till 21(solo)-LOIO 21 till
25(group)-FM 25 till 30(group)-one hour in OT(i'll get you back goon one
day)-Spires/Aviaks in SK 30 till 32(solo)Then to HHK 32-35 (group)-Then
Dawnshroud at 35(solo)-And now I am soloing HG's in Rathe Mountains at lvl
40.

My pally went from Crushbone 20-Paladul caves 21-24(in 4 hours)-To HHK at 24
And still there at 32, hehe. All in groups..

Guess you should follow my pally trail, if you have luclin ofcourse...
