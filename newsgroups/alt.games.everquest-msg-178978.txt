  Giving that a try, though I don't know if netscape will
recognize my intent.  Well, can't hurt to give it a shot.

   Mental.  That word is thrown about so much these days, the
impact seems lost.  I stand by the word I used.  ETP has some
real medical issues, that happen to affect his mind.  I don't
know if it a chemical imbalance, brain injury, or the effects of
drug or alcohol abuse.  At first he annoyed me, but then I came
to the opinion that he's no ordinary troll.  If he's not homeless
(posting from a library or community center?) or in a psych ward
(posting from the rec room?  Oh dear God.. please don't let psych
wards have internet capable computers available to their
patients) now, he will be sooner or later.

   I dunno.  I have a grown up step sister who is at about the
mental age of about 5 or 6.  She's got mental, medical problems. 
Not trying to turn this into a long thing about sensitivity of
the mentally ill, or imply that mental problems should be a "get
out of jail free" card for annoying or criminal behavior, or
claim that I am any sort of expert on the physiology of medical
disease.  Just driving into the ground that I think that ETP has
genuine medical problems. 

  But with luck, I wont have to read them anymore, thanks to your
email filter suggestion.

Annie
