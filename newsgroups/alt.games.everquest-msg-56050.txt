It has to be better than "indifferent" to get the stein.  I have a high-elf
mage I use to run the quest, it took me delivering over 30 loaves of bread to
get from "indifferent" to amiable with Clurg.  The great thing about the loaves
of bread delivering is that it also increases your faction with the guards and
the merchants also, so you can use the bank and stuff safely (stay away from
shadow knight guild tho)â€¦.
