Nope. Bad idea :)

Considering the primary hand damage bonus, more attacks = more bonus.
Faster weapons are godly. For rogues there is a little difference, because
you have to factor backstabs in. A weapon that was 1/8 would be about the
best weapon in the game (for a non-rogue).

>Given an identical ratio, I would think that

Here are two weapons that I ran through copelands (Just a primary hand, no
dual wield to avoid confusion) with backstab calculation turned on:
Base formula is level 50, no haste item, 150 strength.
Cryptrobber's knife: 7/20, ratio of .35 = 769 damage per minute
Gold Plated Koshinataga: 9/25, ratio of .36 = 793 damage per minute

Not much of a difference, is there? What little difference there is can be
explained through the slightly superior ratio of the GPK. 2 more points of
backstabability doesn't offset the half second speed advantage of the
knife.

>1) Reduce aggro (which for melee is metered out
>on number of swings, not on damage, afaik)

Number of swings and damage both factor into it. So does "potential"
damage. A missed backstab will often generate enough aggro to get the mob
to turn on you, despite not inflicting any damage (how the mob knows the
difference between a missed backstab and a missed regular hit is a question
best left to those under the influence of strong narcotics).

As for reducing aggro...that is why rogues have the ability to evade. If
you do it right, it takes a VERY poor tank indeed to not have a back
exposed to you constantly.

>2) Increase backstab, which is based on damage

However, backstab only represents a portion of your damage...I think the
quoted figure is 30-40%. If you ignore the rest of your hits, you will be
substantially lowering your damage.

No great loss.

Well, here is part of the problem. At only level 13, your dual wield skill
eats shit and smiles. You don't get skill checks unless the weapon gets
swung. Once you hit 18 or so, and your dual wield goes off more often than
once per fight, your 1HS will improve dramatically.

Once you hit level 10, there is never a good reason to not have a piercer
in your primary hand.
