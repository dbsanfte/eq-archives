Gay players, like most other players, are playing for fun.  Telling jerks to
go to hell all the time is not fun.  What's wrong with wanting a guild where
the jerks don't get in in the first place?

There are, of course, guilds that aren't specifically organized as gay
guilds that don't have jerks in them.  My guild, for example, doesn't seem
to have jerks, and we have at least one gay player I know of, who is not
interested in leaving for the gay guild on my server (although the gay guild
has a terrific name--"Nameless Love" (this is on The Nameless, BTW), and he
was sorely tempted for a bit, just because of that great pun).

Many people play EQ for the social aspects, and most people like to
socialize with people that have things in common with them.  Like it or not,
much socializing revolves around love and sex (not necessarily in that
order).
