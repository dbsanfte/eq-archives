Well, i'm clever enough to believe that the promises on a game
designers web page have an arbitrary relation to what is actually
released...if it is.

That said shadowbane is another MMORPG being planned by a small
studio. They have screenshots and some form of beta testing so it's
not entirely vapour.

The interesting part is that the PK community believes it to be
an event of apocalyptic proportions. It is probably the highest
profile game to intentionally incorporate PvP at all levels.
