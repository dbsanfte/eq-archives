As a mage I have had very little trouble with mana in LDoN, and
not much trouble with aggro either, despite being fairly new to
serious grouping with a mage (I don't count OT as serious, as its
nearly impossible to get into trouble there)

I drop one or two nukes on each fight, and fights are over with
that second nuke unless there's a resist.  I can maintain one
nuke per fight indefinately, two nukes with mana regen; and by
mana regen I mean clarity or bardsong; I'm not high enough level
for fancy stuff like KEI, POTG, Beastycrack.

Top 5 overall?  They have... snare and DPS.  I guess thats top 5,
I mean, there are only 15 classes.  Lets see, they beat: druids,
monks, mages, wizards, warriors.  Hmm, no I can't think of 10
classes I'd rather see than a ranger.  Perhaps its classes I'd
rather see a ranger than a second one of; now its easy, cleric,
chanter, druid, shaman, warrior, SK, Paladin, Monk, Magician,
Wizard

Well, ok, Magician and Wizard were a stretch, but I'm relying on
your theory that casters have trouble in LDoN.  I just can't 
force Necros into that category, but I can put the other three in
there for you, and make ten that way.


> Beastmasters are easily in the top 5 classes and very nice dps.

This I'd have to agree with, good nukes, heals, melee, pet, can
even act as slower if you can't do better.

Fine DPS, but worse than ranger or rogue DPS, and DPS is the only
thing they really bring to the party these days since there's no
time for feign splitting.  Rogue DPS isn't just fine, its
fantastic.  Ranger DPS is also good, and they have Snare and the
best Track in the game, which is handy post mission for finding
Names
