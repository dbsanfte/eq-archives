Finally hit 20 today, and Boom, I went from doing 28 points a blow to 52 
points a blow (max damage, that is, still a lot of variation in there). 
  That's with a STR around 151, with HOS on I hit a couple times for 62 
points, but then again with HOS before I saw a hit of 35 once... those 
really high end hits seem to be very rare though.

As pointed out elsewhere in the thread, I can load my "good axe" for 
thowing, and have Blunt Axes in inventory (not even in ammo) to use for 
my snare and my stun.  There's little point in actually doing so, as the 
range on all the axes right up to my current Mithril Axe has been 125, 
and the little bit of damage I do from throwing is beneath even my 
untwinked notice (well, untwinked if you don't count spending money I 
earned  with this character in the bazaar), but I do it anyway, I 
suppose to develop good habits.  I make a point of keeping a couple 
stacks of the blunt axes, though, and checking occaisionally to make 
sure I have plenty; they get used a lot in some circumstances:

Axe to pull (often the ranged one, unless I want a head start when its a 
snare one, or snare again if the mob is very short lived)

Axe to snare before mob runs

Axes to stun if the damage output is too high... or (haven't had to do 
this so far) to interrupt casters.

I could see going thru half a dozen axes on one mob alone!

Used it more in PC, have to learn a bit of caution there because waiting 
to see if mob will flee can mean he makes it over the swell of the hill, 
or he may resist, either way, trouble, the latter worst because of the 
12 sec reuse time.

I started seeing triples in my mid teens, more and more common as my 
level or perhaps skill goes up.  At 19 max damage per frenzy went to 30, 
and at 21 its now 35.  This can mean up to 105 points for one click, 
although honestly I've yet to see it go that well.

My dodge and parry are both over 100 now, I was unable to practice 
intimidate while working PC in a bandit group so I haven't even seen the 
3 points or so I might have expected in that time.  Plunked even more of 
my training points into it, though, my next skill isn't till level 30 
anyway.  At this point I'm running into "not enough pp to pay the 
training costs" on the damn skill!  Still unreliable, but have talked to 
lots more people who confirm it works for other classes at around 150 skill.

I went to Crushbone and worked in the throne room in a group till 17, 
have killed every mob in the place except the prophet and Renton several 
times over (they pop in lower level places, which is irritating for me 
cause they aren't there for me to kill, and for lowbies cause they 
slaughter them!).  Good times, although I certainly died a number of 
times, not from the big guys, though, but from the damn Oracles.  I'd 
keep telling people to get on the oracles, kill the oracles first, stop 
the oracles, but no.  Either we'd all stay on the prime target, and slow 
and diseases would make it very difficult to finish them off, or I'd 
peel the oracle off... and he'd solo me, using the same shaman tactics. 
  While I certainly took out lots of oracles, that was the mob that gave 
me the most trouble thru my time there.  Course I didn't have my stun 
trick yet, hadn't been to a trainer, so that would probably have made a 
huge difference.

Then I went to Paladul, got into a group that was splitting B1, and 
started fighting there.  Lots more grouping experience, many different 
combinations (most B1 groups will take anyone and just experiment to see 
who works best doing what... and people walk in and out of the place 
steadily so you see many different combinations.  Bard healer was 
probably the most effective, and then there was the time when it was 
just me and another berserk, but we had HOS and Chloroplast from a 
passing shaman, and still kept the entire B1 clear (both sides)  This 
was shortly after I hit 20, so my damage cap was off, and he was 
somewhat twinked, though still 19; the damage was crazy, and we made a 
point of taking turns tanking, or splitting mutliples, so we were each 
always hurt and regenerating.

The feeling of sheer raw power is intoxicating, and I'm happy with my 
utility abilities so far, snare and stun are a couple of the more useful 
things in the bag of tricks of any character.  There's a bit more 
interaction going on, too, than I had with my warrior (the only other 
melee class I've taken up this high in levels).  Then again, that was 
before the explosions of tomes for all melee classes, I'm jealous of the 
no component 1 point range 50 pull that the other three melee classes 
get; yea, axe components are cheap, but the difference is I can still 
run out.
