Hm, you have the evidence there but failed to see? :)
Bard songs don't last 18 seconds but 3 Ticks. It's important to keep
this in mind. If you have 2 songs fading at the exact same moment you
had started them both in the same tick!
Let's try an example. You cast 1 song and its effect starts 2 seconds in
the current tick. Immediately you twist the second song landing 5
seconds in the exact same tick. If you stop the twist then both songs
will stop at the end of the 3rd tick giving you 16 seconds for the first
and 13 seconds for the second song.
So the conclusion for more then 3 song twist is finding the start of a
tick reliably. Just let a dummy song on all the time. Manasong or
healing come to mind. :)
When you see the song message appear immediately stop it and start your
twist. If you have a pulsed song with 3 second pulses as dummy you will
either start at the beginning or at 3 seconds in the tick. Both
alternatives lets you twist 5 songs. I'm not talking about songs like
amp or 49er selos but 5 normal songs. If you can find the start of a
tick you can even work on a 6 song twist. But due to missed notes and
network lag it is a real hassle. Even 5 song twists will run out of sync
sooner or later. But it can be done. :P
The 6 song twist is theory as i struggle on the 5 song twist. Damn
missed notes kills it way to often. And most mobs are dead before the 5
song twist really gets going. :)
