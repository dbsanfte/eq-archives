Being a Necromancer myself, my jaw nearly hit the floor when I read this. I
have to wonder if they've fully considered what this will do for
Necromancers in groups of 2 or more...especially at level 34 and higher.
With their ability to stack roughly 1000 dmg worth of DOT each at 34, and
their ability to speed mana regen with COB and gain back HP via Lifetap, I'm
guessing that a group of just 2 Necromancers will now be able to fight with
roughly the same efficiency as a full group of 6 players, and do so against
mobs that would pose a bit of a problem to just one Necro of that level...
