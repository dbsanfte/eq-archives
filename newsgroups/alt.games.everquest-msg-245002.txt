That's often a lag issue.  If you experience pretty bad packet loss, the
server will think you're lower than you would be if you had stayed on the
elevator.  Because the packet is delayed, the server shows you as being 100
feet up the elevator shaft, but in the delay the elevator's already gotten
to 120 feet up, so you end up falling because there's no longer anything
holding you up.

Used to be pretty bad in Kelethin too when it got really crowded.

Not the same thing as the boats, which just slide out from under you, or, I
assume with the PoK elevator, that it goes down without you and once you
move, you fall.
