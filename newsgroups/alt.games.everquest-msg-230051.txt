Recently some friends and I were xping at the Skyfire Ramp in the
Overthere. SK pulls while the rest of us waits for the incoming.

Badly wounded mob went after a caster or was trying to get away with
the SK beating on it and I am running after it when it disappears.

I see on my chat display, "The xxxxxx gated." huh?

I still have it targeted, it's still hurt, and it's nowhere in the
vicinity.

Since when did OT mobs acquire the ability to gate? Didn't happen
often but it did happen a couple times that play session.
