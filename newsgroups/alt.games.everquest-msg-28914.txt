Hi Celaeno!

There was one thing I forgot to mention.

I dragged  a few corpses (of folks that had been summoned) back to the base
camp. I know Velious is sensitive about that sort of thing.

No PoG mobs saw me, and I was only grouped with 2 other non-combatant Druids
ATT. Is it possible that the corpse-dragging added me to the hate list and
didn't get clered even after I was killed and rezzed?

The other possible contributing factor was that when I tried Wolf Form my
faction went from 'amiable' to 'apprehensive' with the locals. Very
confusing.

Drywit
