Little while ago, I wen unconscious MTing Burrower, only for a backup
heal or two to stand me up again in time for the rotation to catch up.

Especially on 'damage burst' mobs like AoW's flurry or Emp's 4k proc.

Because they obviously want something astonishingly overpowering, and
don't understand what a delicate balance there is, especially in the
high end game where any changes are at their most pronounced. 

Personally, I think VI has done an amazing job, particularly on with
Emp, in bringing raid-critical roles to a number of previously un-useful
classes. It's a big step away from the usual 'throw wars and clerics at
it until it dies' tactic.
