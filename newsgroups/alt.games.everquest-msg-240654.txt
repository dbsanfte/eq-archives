While it's sort of cheating, Blade of Carnage is droppable and usually
does show up in the bazaar from time to time, and has Enraging Blow.
So you can certainly have Enraging Blow without ever "doing Velious",
if you can scrape together the cash.  Of course if you need to be dual
wielding BoC + Bloodfrenzy (do you?) you'll need to do Luclin.  Or
play on Firiona Vie. :-)

That doesn't invalidate the rest of the points you made, of course
(AoW droppable loot doesn't get you far overall), and personally I'd
say, how can you want to skip Velious?  Velious is full of dragons,
and who could not want to kill dragons?  Of course if you're
restarting and have already done all that I can see how you'd want to
skip it.

Wanting to skip Luclin, particularly VT, I can see, everyone seems to
hate VT.  Though personally I'd like to go there once, at least.
