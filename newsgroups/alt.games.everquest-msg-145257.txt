<snip>

Controlling grief players is easy. Compare Everquest with either diablo2 or
ultima online.
Everquest has never had a problem from grief players, since that is how the
game was designed and policed.
Diablo 2 has always had grief players, and this is so Blizzard can sell more
copies of the game.
Ultime online thought that PK would be cool, but then relized it was hurting
their subscriptions and changed, but by then it was too late for them.

Whats important is if the game maker intends to control the grief playing,
or try and sell more copies of their game to the grief players (Blizzard?)
