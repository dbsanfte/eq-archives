Same here.  I've had mage/necro/bst argue with me as well saying it
can't happen.  I /rude them of course.

This isn't all.  I can mez something while backing my charmed shimmering
rockfiend off he'll sit there patiently, I tell him to attack it, he
goes and does it almost every time.  The only time he doesn't is when he
hasn't been hit by it.  Probably a bug, but most definately happens.  I
can't hardly ever mez anything if he gets in a multiple mob fight, so I
just let him duke it out and slow stuff wich usually agros them on me so
I can mez it - hence how I know he will attack something that's been
mezed for some time... 

On the other hand my pet jin shaman last night was very good about not
attacking mezed stuff, he also was kind enough to haste himself and slow
all the mobs for me, once in awhile he decided to stop being my pet long
enough to give me some mana as well, very nice of him.
