Actually, the game in the RM area becomes somewhat pvp in a way.  Players
compete against each other for mobs.  I'm not condoning KS'ing.  There is
really very little of that in my experience.  But you do have to be quick to
get a giant.  If the lower levels can't handle that then there are *plenty*
of other mobs for them to get xp from.  Rathe Mountains giant hill is
different from any other zone.  Variety is good.
