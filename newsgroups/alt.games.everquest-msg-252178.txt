Thats a load of shit.  Reguardless of who actually "owns" it, it most
certainly is not the last person to steal it.   If you jump a guy running
out of a bank with a bag of stolen cash, beat him upside the head with a
baseball bat, then take the cash home with you instead of returning it, you
can bet you would be prosecuted for armed robbery, even though the owner at
the time you took the property didn't have legal rights to it.
