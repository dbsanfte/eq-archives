I remember reading a web page that had a pretty comprehensive list of known
zone experience modifiers, but I'll be damned if I could find it again. The
link was posted in this NG, but again I haven't been able to find it though
I have been looking between jobs all day.

Does any kind soul have the link on hand? I would appreciate it greatly if
you could post it.

Thanks in advance.
