    One advantage of multiple accounts is more than one family member will
be able to play online at the same time, providing you have multiple
computers and connections. Will save a lot of fighting. As for as monthly
fees, 15 and 16 year olds should be able to earn at least 10 bucks a month,
if they really want to play, plus whatever expansions they desire in the
future. Also, consider it as insurance that junior cannot delete your level
55 character a year from now, because he is angry about getting grounded for
something. Ah, you better change the password on you account now.
