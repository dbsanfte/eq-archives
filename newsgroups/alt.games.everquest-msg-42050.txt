Well thank you very much Ben ... I will continue to do so. I have to 
wonder WHY it would be insulting? The fact that it is true? Boy you're 
feelings of inadequacy must be monumentous. I really must apologize for 
the Pax Britannia ending and all. Personally, I wasn't consulted on the 
Pax Americana. And if you're still pissed about Lend-Lease, I think 
Roosevelt was robbed. While the islands are nice to vacation in, I'd 
rather have had a bit more.
