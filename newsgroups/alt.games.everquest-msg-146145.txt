I started a wood elf druid.  Almost level 9.  I'm having a VERY
good time putting together all my Leafrunner equipment.  The exp
feels free because it's all a side effect of doing my Leafrunner
quests.

I'm almost done gathering all my Leafrunner equipment, though.
So now I'm starting to worry about my weapon (I'm still using my
newbie weapon!) and shield.

I'm thinking a Shiny Brass Shield off the orc trainer in Crushbone
makes sense.  I can obtain that.  Eventually.  :)

So that leaves the weapon.  I'm thinking of ignoring all my
weapon skills except 1-hand blunt.  Why?  Because I'm not uber.
I'll never be uber.  The fact that the druid epic is 1HS will
never matter to me because I'll never get it.  Guaranteed.

So my druid is a 1-hand blunt kind of wood elf.  I'm looking
for a low delay weapon.  Damage doesn't matter too much, but
I'd like something reasonable because I melee a lot.  (I want
to raise my Offense and Defense as much as possible while I'm
still low level).

+WIS would be a bonus but isn't required.  Something I need
to quest for (a reasonable quest, not a quest that involves
fighting 100 other people for a rare spawn with a rare drop)
would be nice since it makes it feel less like I'm exp grinding
and just getting exp as a side effect.  Magic is required
since I want to be able to hit things like wisps.

I'm open to buying something on the open market if necessary.

Any druids out there with any recommendations?  Thanks in advance!
