I finally made my sonic wolfbane dagger and got my journeymans cloak.
Woohoo!  Well they're not that great but they do continue to greater things.
Anyway, the next thing I am to gather is a grimling chieftain staff, an
owlbear guardian talon, and a sonic wolf guardian fang.  These are not from
a spoiler site, they are straight from my log.  Now, I have hunted this zone
for quite some time now and these item I have never seen.  Perhaps the
chieftain staff is a rare drop.  I have only killed him like 20 times so
maybe I just need to keep at it.  I have killed many more guardian wolf
though and never have I seen a sonic wolf guardian fang.  I have seen sonic
wolf fang and giant wolf fang but never a sonic wolf guardian fang.  Lastly,
I have good invis and I have tracking and I have never seen or found any
guardian owlbears.  Can anyone give me some tips or encouragement towards
answers?
