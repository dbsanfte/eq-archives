I hadn't played since just before the release of GoD.  I noticed that
the food and drink that I have no longer give me it's stats when I
have it in one of my top inventory slots.  ( grobb liquized meat and
centi steaks, respectively.)  
I tried but couldnt find the patch message where this was changed.
Anyone know about this?  

thanks.
Bank of America defines chintzy IMHO.  
Email for details.
