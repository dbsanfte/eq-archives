The ones doing the killing (and killing themselves in the process) are
religious zealots. The people like Bin Laden who have a grudge against
the US are using the zealots as tools to further their own agengas. If
there were no zealots to send off to die, there would be no problem.
You don't see the likes of Bin Laden or Arafat leading the "jihad"
from the front lines. The base of the problem is in "Islamic
Extremism" that breeds soldiers prepared to die and unwilling/unable
to question the "wisdom" of their self-motivated leaders.

Not for his troops, and that is why he is so dangerous. He uses
religion like a drug to control his followers and direct their rage
and ferver at the west. Most of his followers don't have enough
education or knowledge to make an informed decision to "hate" the
actions of the west. It is much simpler to just foster hate for
"non-believers".

I am informed are you?

They have to "hate" (or blame) somebody for their. Attacking is the
end result

70 years ago the German people were beat down and in the depths of a
massive depression (not unlike the poverty in the Middle East). Then
Hitler comes along and whips them into a frenzy of nationalistic pride
and hatred for basically anyone not German (or in todays case not
Fundamentalist Islam). Through the process he himself becomes the
national "extremist" religion (Nationalsim is just as potent a
religion as any form of worship). He builds a massive military machine
putting the unemployed to work or into uniform (just like the "Bin
Laden's" who gather young idealistic muslims). Restoring pride and
filling the German people with a purpose.....to take their rightful
place as the true leaders of the world (or in the case of extremist
Islam convert the world and kill those who stand in the way). 

Hitler had no choice but to go to war, because that was the only
option left after turning the whole of Germany into a hate/pride
filled war machine. 

At some point it becomes "put up or shut up". You can see this in the
pattern of terrorists attacks against the west over the last 10-15
years. Like a simmering pot boiling over, attacks are made to in
essence "blow off steam" and secure the power of the terrorists
leadership. You can also see this in action when multiple groups take
the credit for the same act. They quickly try to take credit to
impress their followers/financial backers/new recruits/etc. Nuts like
Bin Laden have to lash out against those that they have demonized or
the "faithful" will question their resolve and ultimately their right
to rule.
