Go with banded.
You do need some decent weapons tho. I would suggest at least one
magical wepon for wisp hunting. (Tho there is Magical Monologue). A
Silvery Axe or Polished Granite Tomahawk should go for under 20pp.
Otherwise beg someone for a Velium Weapon from Velious.

Hunt wisps, keep Lightstones and Greater Lightstones and do this quest
in NK.

Sell the Concordance back to the vendors for 8pp profit from one
Greater Lightstone
