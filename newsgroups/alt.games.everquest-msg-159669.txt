>1. EQ numbers just aren't what they used to be.

I'll bet the new subscriber numbers are down, at least.  I'll also wager a 
lot of the low characters are twinks that can solo effectively for a while.

I think this is a given.

Possible factor, but I started playing EQ again after many months off and 
noticed the same thing, even before the halloween-fest.

Speaking of this, has anyone seen the Runebladed Sword of Night drop?  
Draglorvin would like to get another on of those on the New and Improved 
Draglorvin.

Amen.  I'm dreading getting Draglorvin to 29 and heading to Dalnirs to find 
out there's no one there or the ones that -are- there are morons.  I miss 
that steady group I had from the lowe 20s to 45 last time.  We were 
unstoppable.
