  I never got a loop in my time hunting them, but I did get a fair
number of legchoppers, tree flayers, grub diggers and hammers of
flattening.  If you see a giant with a weapon, kill it. :)  Even the
saplings sometime drop 60pp legchoppers if I recall correctly.

  Also, the fellow who mentioned the "safe spot" by the rock is
correct.  Don't rest too close to the walls, because sometimes on the
forest side of the wall there's a wandering giant who will aggro on
you through the wall.  The "safe meditation rock" is to the right of
one of the entrances to the fort (right if you're going in to the
fort, not going out).
