The common wisdom is that the drop rate is better in CT.

The problem is you need to be 29 or so to take on the gators (solo) or you
have to stand around with hat in hand bumming the mage items from strangers.

The first four magicians in Najena are level 18 but have friends. I recently
did the Najena mages when I was level 24 and it worked fairly well. The
elementals standing around would not aggro me so I only had to worry about
the mages and their pets. I was able to get exp from the mages plus bonus
exp from the dungeon. How long did it take? Pretty much all of level 24. I
dinged 25 just before I got the last item, the shovel. I also got all four
words of elemental mastery in case I someday do the Magician epic quest.

It's fairly boring (no one else there usually) and repetitious but EC and FP
are a short jog away when you need a break from the monotony.
