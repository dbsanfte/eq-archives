Project M, as it was called, was in place for a short time on the Test
server.  It was quickly taken down because teams of PC-controlled mobs were
griefing newbs.

I mean, think about.  What if you're level four and *every* giant rat
suddenly turned and pounced on you every time you went beyond the guard's
aggro radius?  =)

In the end, a potentially neat idea was nixed because of the potential for
abuse.
