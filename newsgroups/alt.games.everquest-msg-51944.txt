Widowmistress is 37 or thereabouts. Low blue to a 49 player. 
She's way back in a corner, though; unless you need something
specific from her or her spider friends, there's no need to 
go back there.

Everything else in that zone, as far as I know, is 30 and under 
and shouldn't be a challenge for a 49 mage+pet.
