Actually, yes...I didn't say anything about it being dreary, though.

If you want to get to a lot of the fun content (fun for me is Planes/Gods/
Dragons/epic fights), you HAVE to level up.  You MUST get to a higher
level simply to be included in some of that stuff, and you MUST raid
to get the fun gear or neat toys.

How do you get exp most efficiently? Exp grinding.  Low blue mobs
in a constant stream was the most efficient.  Pulling the same 20
mobs over and over wasn't exactly fun, but what it did was allow me
to advance to where I COULD do the fun stuff.

Kind of like work, yeah.  Work sucks, but it allows you to have money
to take care of your responsibilities and have some fun with the leftovers.
I don't go to work because I love my job, I go because my kid needs to
eat and have shelter from rain.  And I want to be able to pay my internet
bill...
