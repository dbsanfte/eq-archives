I'm trying to do my latest tash spell quest on my enchanter (he's 46), but
my sol ro faction is apprehensive, and, even though I'm an enchanter, my
spells don't increase my faction enough for the quest NPC give me the pouch
I need to do the quest.  I think I hailed effretti, so my faction was
lowered.. but it was a couple years ago I think, so I don't really remember
=0P.  Anyways, I've been slaughtering shadowmen by the hundreds, and I've
had one faction increase, but it's insanely slow.. would quests give me much
better faction?  If so, which ones?  Thanks. (PS, I guess the quests will
have to be ones that you don't need Sol Ro faction to start, I think a
couple of the cleric armor quests can be started without sol ro faction).

Thanks,
