Here's what my log said 
[Wed Feb 13 22:54:27 2002] Your feet move faster.
[Wed Feb 13 22:54:30 2002] a bixie regards you indifferently -- looks
like a reasonably safe opponent.

I t hought I had targetted this in Kith Forest but with all the
auction messages before and after, I must have been in EC and have no
idea if they are a different kind of bixie.  

Unfortunately, I did not target a bixie in Misty Thicket until after I
took the faction hit.  They are ready-to-attack me.  I got the faction
hit from someone killing a bixie drone though.  

Basically, I wanted to make sure I wouldn't get a hit from playing
Selo's near someone killing guards or something.
