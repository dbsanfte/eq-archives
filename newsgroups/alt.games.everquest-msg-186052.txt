I submit that the portal books might indeed be the reason why more people 
are coming to EQ. Not as newbies, but RETURNING after long absences of 
not paying for an account.

I started back with a new account after a 2 year absence and I can tell 
you without a doubt I would have already quit again if NOT for the 
portals. The world is FAR too big now for a newbie looking to group. 
Without the portals I would have to spend hours just to look for a PORT 
and I don't have the time or the inclination to do that now.

For the higher level population the books are just a convenience. Most 
high levels could just send a guildchat message and get a port from a 
wizard or druid in a short time. For newbies with no guild and not high 
enough to have met people with porting abilities the books are now 
NECESSARY.
