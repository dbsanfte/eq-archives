A better idea would be to write a batch file which does this and add it to 
your Start menu in the Everquest folder (or maybe somewhere on your 
desktop). That makes it a simple matter of point and click.

Also it would be a good idea to have one which resets the mp3s to their 
original files. No sense in continuously downloading the same mp3s.
