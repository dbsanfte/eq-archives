Used to be that you had to give them 2 weapons or they wouldn't use
their dual wield skill, but they changed that long ago. Now, it only
matters if the weapons proc or if their base dmg stat is more than 1/2
of the pet's unarmed max hits.

Of course, I have a few related questions... A while back, before they
changed BST warders, it was discovered that their unarmed skill sucked
and giving them weapons would increase their hit accuracy hugely. (Now
Warders run off of the BST weapon skills, so anything but blunt,
pierce, or HTH will lower their accuracy) My question is does this
apply to mage and necromancer pets?

Other question... Elemental damage on weapons (such as the "Disease
damage 2" on the Fungal Dewclaws) or Bane Damage. Does it factor into
the pet's damage always or only if the pet uses the weapon's damage
rather than it's own because the weapon's damage is better?
