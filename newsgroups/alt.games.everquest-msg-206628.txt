Ok.  So I and my guild are tired of getting wiped by this guy lol.. I wanted
to post here and see if you guys have a good strategy on killing him.  What
we have been doing was: Kill the entrance mobs, then his guards, get MT, and
2 rampage tanks to go up and all get agro by using bows.  then they would
all go in and melee (MT was 2 boxing so she could see when blinded).  Ok..
even with their backs to the slab.. someone still got knockbacked to the
wall adds.

a question I have is, since he is perma rooted, can't we get a mt to go in
and keep agro, and use the nukers to mana burn and nuke away? (just an idea
so dont laugh=))

any advice is very much appreicated as we will be trying him again=)
