Blanket - Eastern Wastes, any class

 Garadain Glacierbane in the Eastern Wastes asks you to make him a blanket so
he can stay warm. In a large sewing kit combine two High Quality Tundra Kodiak
hides and two High Quality Snow Cougar pelts. The blanket this creates is
no-drop. Giving this blanket to Garadain results in a Copper Coldain Insignia
Ring, faction changes, and some experience. The blanket becomes trivial lower
than skill 82.

I did this quest the other day at 40 skill.   The blanket was already trivial,
and I succeeded on the first try.

Btw, thank you for the page.   I've used it quite often helping my friend get
started on the Shawl quests... Almost ready to start her on the crystaline
silk, then on to that hideous Wu's stuff.   Not looking forward to that part.
