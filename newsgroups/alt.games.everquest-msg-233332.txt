FD still fails at 170+ but just less I think (most often for non-skill
check reasons such as getting hit by a spell or FDing whilst still
attacking).  As for resetting faster, I don't believe that to be the
case.  As far as I know there is one class AA ability that cuts the FD
recycle time (it's name escapes me).

I'd be interested to see if anyone has any info on mend as I haven't
seen any change since 100 either.
