    So simply don't get bound there, then.  
    My ranger got bound at the bank in FV last night.  Running to the
zone in LOIO is hands down the scariest redudent occasion any of my
characters have yet endured.  My shaman has made the run many times,
with SoW and Lev, and my heart beats faster every time.  With my slow, 
earthbound ranger, though, the run is terrifying.  Also, exhilarating, 
true.  But if I could bind at the mill, I would do so in an instant.
 
Annie <--- was bound for several levels at the gypsy camp in the
           Karanas, as well, so doesn't mind being bound on the 
           edge of the abyss.
