the only thing i've heard about is that it isn't usable by beastlords,
and people are complaining that before luclin came out, BST was listed
as a usable class on the tunic, therefore the tunic was "nerfed" to
remove BST.

(personally, i think that since there never was a time when a BST
could _actually_ use one, nothing was nerfed.)
