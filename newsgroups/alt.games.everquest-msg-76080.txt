I ran into what appeared to be a brand new NPC in SRo pathing near the
druid rings this weekend. Forget her name, but was a DE in weird
clothes. Conned red with ally faction to my 53 Troll Champion. We were
speculating that she might be part of the BL epic. No clue though,
because even with max faction she gave me a usual insulting comment when
hailed, something long the lines of "Fortunately for you, I have no need
for troll meat at this time. Run along before this situation changes."
