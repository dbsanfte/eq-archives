The monk/shaman is a great duo but I do not really think you mean to
say anywhere.  The monk/shaman will win in dungeons but not always
outside.  No monk can out pull a druid outside.  Never ever.  A druid
can pick the best mob, go to it, bring it back, and snare it for the
evil necro all before the monk gets back.

The druid/necro can take on mobs above the level the monk/shaman do.
Just by the nature of the classes.
