Then just don't use them.  A very simple solution really.

Myself I liked pok books, they made the game much more fun and far 
less tedious for me.  The nice thing is they really are all things to 
all people in a way.  Them that like them can use them and them that 
don't can ignore them.   The trouble is that the folks that did not 
like them wanted them out in spite of the fact that a huge portion of 
the population thought they were a boon to the game.

The anti-book crowd just had no tolerance or self-control as far as I 
could tell.
