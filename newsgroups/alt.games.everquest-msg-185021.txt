    Congrats! You can also MGB Ethereal Elixir to help heal the raid against
AoE damage. I'm 60% of an AA away from it myself, having decided to bite the
bullet and get it. 40 minute AA's in CoD also helped prompt my decision. ;-)
The GL even went and did a Glyphed Rune Word turn-in for me and I have Hand
of Virtue waiting for me to get MGB.

    Understand, I'm a cantankerous sort. So that may colour my choices.

    Divine Arbitration is the biggest crutch I've ever seen. Not paying
attention? Don't have good reaction times? DivArb and be happy! I've yet to
see the ability save a squishy PC that was being beat on since the only
aggro it sheds is low health aggro. If you couldn't cast SR fast enough to
save such a person before, you ain't gonna do it now. Some clerics swear by
it as something to do to save a MT when they first engage. In that case,
it's fairly useful - about a 6 K heal with no associated heal aggro. But
it's only necessary if you don't have sufficient spam healers, and usually a
guild has plenty of those (or a paladin to do sacrificial LoH).

    Given that it's 18 points to train it to full, I don't see this as being
a good use of points. Here's what I would do with 18 points instead: Radiant
Cure 1, Radiant Cure 2, Innate Enlightenment 1, ND 1, HA 1, MC 1. You'll get
a LOT more bang for the buck with that.

    The increase isn't big for the points spent with IE. Even though my WIS
is well over my WIS cap, I've been leaving IE because of that. As a
guideline for getting PP/IE, I wouldn't get PP unless my STA buffed with
Boar (+60 STA) is above the new cap I'd have AND my unbuffed WIS is above
the new cap I'd have. Ditto on WIS and IE.

    There's a LOT of nasty debuffs that Radiant Cure strips. It's my next
planned AA.

    Adept > Gift. Adept always happens, so you always get use out of it. 98
times out of 100 when you have HG, your heals are the same as if you had no
AA's spent. I think HG is worthwhile, but not until other things have been
looked after first.

    First, I'd recommend filling in a bunch of 2-point stuff to get a lot of
neat abilities quickly. HA 1, ND 1, MC 1, and a PP if you meet the WIS/STA
requirements I listed above. From there, the raid cleric priorities for you
should be, in no particular order: Healing Adept, Healing Gift, Natural
Durability, Innate Enlightenment / Planar Power, Radiant Cure, Unfailing
Divinity. The last one is a HUGE sleeper ability. Given I just listed 121 AA
points worth of stuff, that should keep you busy for a while. ;-)
