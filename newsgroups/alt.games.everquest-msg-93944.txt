Basically I want to see if I can...99% of my xp since about level 25 has
come in groups.  I spent almost 10 levels (40-50)in DL alone and it got a
bit boring.  I also thought I'd get through 51 by soloing or getting a small
group; more xp.  You are right tanking, isn't my fortï¿½, but I hope it will
improve a bit when I break the soft caps at 51.  Basically skill wise I am a
level 40 char with a few extra hp and mana.

I'll try EW and Panic Animal. (throwing in Ensnare and a Dot for good
measure).
Equipment wise I have a Centi LS and Green Jade Broad sword for my 1HS and a
Swarmcaller for 2HS (Gotta love the STA and STR boosts).  I'll work out the
combined DPS to see if 1hs or 2hs would be better for soloing as I wont' be
worrying about aggro management :)

My (self buffed) ac is only 806 so that's something I need to work on.  My
30 monk is well on his way to that figure and he's 20 levels behind in skill
and equipment.

As an aside, if anyone was worried about neglecting a 2h skill too long;
don't.  At level 42 I had zero 2HB and 2Hs.  I soft capped them by level 47,
with the aid of a few shammy dex buffs and chanter boons:)  As long as the
group didnt mind, I was bashing / slashing away and seeing the skill ups
softened somewhat the monotony of slaying all those drolvargs and drachnids.

Thanks for the advice (and keep it coming!),

Tzen
