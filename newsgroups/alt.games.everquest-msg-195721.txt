I've been on Cazic since the game came out and never heard of the Ice Giants
being three separate camps. Shoot when I've been there killing the giants
I've never even heard someone shout a camp check.  You say it's a
gentleman's agreement, but it doesn't change the fact that they're three
separate camps?  I would say this is not a "fact", it is what you have
experienced.
