Which has nothing at all to do with whether they are in one or not.  I've
seen lots and lots of wizards in midsized guilds or unguilded who have
manaburn.  That number is big, and continuing to grow, since all it takes is
some time to get it.  What guild you are in is irrelevant, a wizard can solo
thier way up to it quite easily.

Level 60 with AA does not automaticly equal being in an uberguild.  (Sheesh,
and you were talking about *other* people making assumptions)

Hah... now thats funny.  Manaburn wizards have so much of an advantage when
it comes to killing dragons that it's not even funny.  They're 6 porting
classes, porting into a zone that they all have spells to take them directly
to.  They don't even need to buff, just med to full.  If your raid knows of
a dragon being up, and even one of those wizards knows... you're not very
likely to win the race.  Port in 24 or more people and buff them up,
compared to 6 people porting themselves in and using a 6 second ability...

Aside from that... lets see a little thinking.  If this works on Sev, the
same thing is true for both Gorenaire and Talendor.   Gore - White scale,
Frost book MQ, Runed Bolster Belt, rare spells.  Talendor - Rare spells,
Burnt Book MQ, Cloak of flames, (hell, you might even get something for the
Red Scale)  Both in zones the wizards can port directly to.   VS - farmed
for Kunark legs and easy to get to.    Vox and Naggy - See Gore and
Talendor.  (Yes, as of a little while ago, MB still worked on them if you
did it right.)

Let me know when reality hits.  I'll be waiting here with the one I
perceive, when you wake up to it.


(I also find it quite amusing that you're attacking me when I don't even
disagree with you about the ability to buy / camp all the equipment James
listed.   I was just taking another fun little potshot at how ridiculous the
manaburn situation is.)
