Sorry about that -- every once in a while my newsreader
(or maybe my newsfeed, hard to tell) slips a cog and
misindexes newly arrived messages (until I exit and
restart).

When I replied to your message, it was stacked as if
it was in reply to me, and it had Ben's name on the
message label.  So I failed to notice the actual author
name in the message body and when I saw what appeared
to be a "piss off" response from Ben, I responded
accordingly.

Now, the message tree has correct message labels but
my own message has vanished entirely (along with Ben's
post questioning my reading comprehension -- I only
saw it because you quoted it).  /bonk Agent.
