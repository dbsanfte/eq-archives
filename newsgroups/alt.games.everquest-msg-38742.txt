From what I saw at E3, they are actually coming along nicely, especially
PlanetSide.

Forcing? I have no interest in any of the content I may have left behind
due to TCC, even if it happened to include planar-class Druid items,
which I certainly doubt. I don't feel "forced" to do anything, and I can
still visit the zones, see the sights and slaughter the mobs if I feel
so inclined. To be frank, being forced to buy some lowbie items, or to
be locked out of lowbie quests doesn't faze me in the slightest.
