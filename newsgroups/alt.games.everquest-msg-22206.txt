I've recently started hunting in Oasis and the hunting is good.  Me and my
Pet, Ellie.

What I thought I noticed was that the various creatures there, crocs,
caimans, ghouls, etc do not even notice me.  I actually enjoy going hand to
hand and often run in to whacka whack so that Ellie doesn't get annoyed that
she's always doing all the work.  The critters never even pay attention to
me and I'm sometimes getting in better whacks than Ellie is.  It's like I'm
jumping up and down, whacking away, right in its face yelling, "Hey you! I'm
whacking you here!  Please stop killing Ellie!"  And generally it just
ignores me.

If I'm frying it from afar, same thing.  I'm starting to get my feelings
hurt.

BTW, Ellie is usually Air.  I tried an Earth, but I LIKE it when the critter
starts to run away so that Ellie and I can chase its back and kill it at
leisure.  I really don't like it when the Earth Pet roots the thing and then
it proceeds to stand there and beat us to kingdom come.

Oh, do you ever feel guilty for running for the Zone and leaving your poor
Pet all alone to die.
