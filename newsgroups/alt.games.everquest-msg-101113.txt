I suspect a lot is beyond you, from the tone of this post.

I'm sorry, could you point out where I said "I QUIT"?

As stated in another post, one business model is to focus charges
on service.  Get people involved by making entry cheap/free and
then sustain the cash flow by charging for services.

If you had any grasp on business, then perhaps you would have
thought of that before you posted.

But I'm not really here to get into a pissing contest with anyone,
although I certainly have a full bladder.

Good day.
