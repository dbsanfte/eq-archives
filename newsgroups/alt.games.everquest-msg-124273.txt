I've seen that happen as well.  The mob may not have "meant"
to attack you, but being hit by the AoE "means" you're fighting
it.  Doesn't sound like a bug to me.

(I saw it happen a lot in ToV when first fighting there.  It
was fairly easy to see the faction drop from max ally to KoS
when hit by an AoE...)
