Frankly, I think the alignment grouping restriction was stupid. It's
setting things too unrealisticly into black, white, and only one shade
of gray. Of course, I think the "set in stone" alignments concept in
itself is stupid...

"Good" and "evil" have worked together against a mutual goal lots of
times in literature and reality. The alignment grouping restriction
only hinders RP by forcing you to play your character by someone
else's inflexible view of what they should be.
