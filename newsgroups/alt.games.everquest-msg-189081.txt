It isn't your connection, because it wouldn't cause the lock up.

Firstly, for the window problem, take a look in eqclient.ini and search for
WindowedMode and make it false ( WindowedMode=FALSE ) - any time you get a
problem with window mode and can't get it back to full screen using
alt+enter, look for that - sometimes happens on mine.

For the lockups.... Just this PC? is there any form of network involved?
other PC's connected? Some configurations (too god damn many for my liking)
seem to think it's a good idea to let the Network Card and Sound Card share
the SAME IRQ. EQ is hardware intensive to the extreme. Look for IRQ
conflicts, and install latest drivers for sound/video card, and run
scandisk.

Good luck,
Dave.
