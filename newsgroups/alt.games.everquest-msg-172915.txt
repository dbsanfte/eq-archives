Which particular ones spawn the epic Lords?  I think I remember from the 1 
raid I was on that the one downstairs spawns Ghiosk, and that would make 
sense with the one group fighting him outside the building with all the 
others still "up."

Neh'Ashiir spawns at the final building on the BR cycle, I just gleaned 
that from reading about her.

My guess is that the last one up the elevator spawns Rak eventually.  Is 
this right?

So, what do the other BRs spawn at the end of their cycle?  Or, do they 
just not spawn something when they die?

I want to take the guild back in and do our best to avoid spawning anything 
that is going to reduce our change at getting a Jade Reaver or two so any 
information is appreciated.
