Yes, but an ebayed account will not be registered under the same user
as the buyer. Which will set off bells and whistles and likely cause trouble

The only way ebayed accounts work, is if you keep them out of the eyes of
verant employees. Transfering characters from/to ebayed accounts does not
seem the best idea.
