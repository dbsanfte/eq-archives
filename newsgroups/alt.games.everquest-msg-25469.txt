On a related note, are there any robes out there
that a melee can wear?  Half-elf rogue in particular...

With my Erudite mask on, I'm wearing a Ravenscale
"dress," which looks like a robe...'course in all other
illusions it's definately chain armor.  Are there any
"robes" that a melee player can wear (not raw silk
either...rogues can't wear it, although it does look
like a robe on a monk)?  Stats are not important,
because it's not "fighting" gear.
