Suprised you are finding a chanter in DL.  DL sucks for chanters, lot
better places indoors.  Nothing much to do.  At least that's my
experience.

Definately.  I'm having a hard time finding Shaman who are willing to do
so, I hardly ever do even when I'm without a shaman.  They seem to like
to sit on their big fat asses.  Chanter slows take so long to cast, mob
is usually half (or 3/4) dead by the time they go off...
