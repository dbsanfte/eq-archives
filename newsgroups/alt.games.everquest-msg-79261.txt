Quite possibly, he was interested in being able to bank in North Freeport.
Killing off Freeport Militia guards is a great way to raise the Paladin
faction, which is the faction of the guards in North Freeport.  There really
is a good reason to be killing them sometimes.  It does mean that you are
KOS in East and West Freeport, but heck, he already was KOS there anyway.
You need to learn not to depend on the guards to save you, they won't always
be there.  Fight near the zone line, so you can run to it if need be.
