Heh, that was my first thought on reading Annie's post as well. :) I 
remember one clone that got subjected to a confused docbot who replaced an 
injured leg with a spare laser rifle...  That tended to fire randomly f he 
had to walk anywhere...

We had a really good Friend Computer for that one. :)
