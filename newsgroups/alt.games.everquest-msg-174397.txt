Oh, crap . . . sorry :)  Please forgive me....I just started playing on my
BF account.
I am a Mage....oops! He wouldn't let me start a wizard or cleric because he
already has them.  What is that saying?  I kneel before you in humility . .

I suppose you could always try grouping with the few people in toxx and gain
