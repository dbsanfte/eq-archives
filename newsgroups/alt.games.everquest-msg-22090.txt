Mostly, this is just luck. You find a group and hope things go good for you.

As far as I can tell from a Shaman playing friend of mine, you mostly buff
and heal, and then melee if nobody needs anything and your mana's not low.
In short, you're not a tank. :) But you can do your part if there's not
something better for you to do.

Most people assume these days that you'll "know your role" (bleh), so I
wouldn't expect the group leader to tell you what to do.

I once had the privlidge of playing my brother's ranger 31st level ranger.
Not my type of class. :) He did seem to do decent damage, though.

I'd say you're right, there, that you'd just stop attacking and hold still
until the real tanks taunted it off of you. I wouldn't see why anybody would
make you the puller, unless you're in wide open spaces so you can run along
with your SoW.

Leaders or the group in general should always assign pullers, though.

When pulling, check everybody's mana, and make sure everybody's life isn't
too low. You can just do a quick, "Ready for more? :)" and see how they
respond. Don't wait for everybody to respond, if you have a full group and
three folks say go for it, well then start heading out. If somebody says to
wait then you can come back. After a little bit you'd get a feel for how
'ready' the group is with how much life and mana they have.

For the most part, casters (should) usually report their mana after each
pull. So you should have a pretty good general idea of what you have to work
with. IF they don't, they're probably a Nec (like my main :p), and have
enough mana to handle the next pull. Nec players seem to be pretty self
reliant and if we don't remember to do a mana report after each pull,
they'll pipe up if their mana gets too low. Though granted, it's really no
excuse and all caster players should get into the habbit of this..

Your call. I'd say go for it and just play. If somebody starts having a fit,
you're probably not going to have fun anyway.
