Trouble is I -like- hearing EQ. There are some audible cues that are 
useful after all. (Like when a mob starts casting a heal, or if 
something attacks you while you are afk, ... ok... that's about it ;p

As an added consideration, like many players I run a voip application to 
communicate. --Nothing-- is more distracting having voice clips come out 
of the game in that scenario. You do not want the game -talking- to you 
if you are already trying to listen to friends.

In my case I have game & mp3 audio piped out of my surround speakers, 
while voice is directed through a USB headset. (Its -the- ideal gaming 
setup I think), but I wouldn't want to try to listen to voice coming 
from the game and the headset at the same time. That's just a bad scene.

Now we've heard that there will be an option to turn off the voice 
overs. And that will spare me the need for your overpriced instructions. 
=)

However, if 80 or 90% of the player base rapidly tire of trooper mozo's 
taunts and disable voice... then that rapidly argues against bothering 
to record them in the first place. Why direct development money and 
resources to an aspect (nearly) everybody has turned off?? Its rather 
like the EQ music... I haven't turned that on since pre-kunark. Its 
truly a waste of time to even bother, imo.

Its maddening enough that I can't get to some of the content I'm paying 
for by virtue of the fact that I can't play the game with as many people 
as SOE has decided I should. (I can group with 4-6 easily enough even at 
3am... but 18 is pushing it and 36+ is a pipe dream. It would be even 
worse to find out I'm paying for content that I find distracting and 
annoying.

Its not like my PC can't handle it (like some people with spell effects 
or models), but that I don't -want- it. Period. (Like some people with 
new models I suppose ;) but that's personal aesthetic issues with the 
new models not a preference for low polygon boxy models per se).

Maybe EQ should go the cutscene route... at least those are singular 
events, and I'd listen to the music and voice maybe for those...
