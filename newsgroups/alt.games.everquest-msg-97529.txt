I have one quick question..

I have not completed the epic quest (of course.. since i am just a
teenager..) for the Vah Shir BST claws, but i have the Reinforced claws..

So.. the question is : Should i use two claws, or should i use one claw and
maybe a piercing weapon in the other hand? As of now i give more kickass
with two claws, but if i gain skills in piercing to the level of H2H i have
now, and maybe get a good piercing weapon.. ?

What do you think? Buy a great piercing 1H weapon, or just go with the
claws?
