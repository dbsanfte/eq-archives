The category is not one where I'm rating something on their ability to WIN
against a no-win situation. Imagine a train of 30 reet frogs and
juggernauts against a group of 6. That is the kind of situation I mean.
Enchanters tend to cause a lot of aggro, fold over quickly under any kind
of punishment.

Yes, there are some inconsistancies in how that rating is applied. As I
said, this was a preliminary copy :)
