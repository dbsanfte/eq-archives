Well, the point of a guild war can be 2 things, fun or settling disputes.

If a guild war was for fun, just to have fun with another guild, it 
would be bad manners.

But in this case, the guild war was started over a dispute (and even 
over the AC, one of the few mobs in the game that in 99% of the cases 
are KSed), it would be just like a real war, where the point are KILLING.

In medieval times, if 2 groups was at war, it would be a STUPID mistake 
to hold a wedding and not have guards to make sure youre not attacked.

True, it might be bad form to use one of your own alts to spy on the 
guild, but depending on the guild, you could easily have gotten that 
info another way. In our guild, events like that would be posted on the 
webpage, so you would know where and when to attack.
Or to really go into the point of a war, he could have bribed one of the 
  persons in tha guild to give him the info.

The fact that a GM dont like that must mean hes a moron. One of the most 
important things in the game are strategy. You cant just walk in wiht 40 
people randomly grouped and and just charge Vox. Verant have on several 
occations commented on players strategy to do things that was never 
planned, and they like that idea. The GM should have been close to 
overjoyed to see someone use this kind of plan to do a massive attack 
when in a guild war.
