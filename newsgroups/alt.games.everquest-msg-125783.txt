True indeed. This is one of my favorite evil places.  It looks really neat.
The level designers obviously put some thought into the Qeynos sewers.
There are also evil vendors under Freeport.  I am an Erudite necro who never
does faction work.  I can shop in Freeport, Overthere, Thurgadin, and the
Nexus to name a few.  People do hate you, and gather shadows is your best
friend (second only to feign death).
Good hunting dark brother.
