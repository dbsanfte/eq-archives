My theory is that it only works on the LDoN charm items, ones you buy off
adventure merchants. They give stat increases but only in the LDoN dungeons
and guess as you get more knowledge ad the gem gets more powerful, that it
raises the stat of the LDoN charm item. Havn't confirmed this as i am
normaly so busy a soon as the group zones in that i forget to check.
