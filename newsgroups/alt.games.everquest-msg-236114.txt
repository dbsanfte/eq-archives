Naive stupidity... indeed.

Pull your head out of the sand, other than the weirdo family -
breeding thing these little self - sustaining communities ALREADY
EXIST. Its the height of naivete to tell me it can't be done.

Check out Amish or Hutterite colonies.  They are *gasp* small self
sustaining communities with limited and controlled interaction with
greater society... that still exist today enveloped by our societies.
And not to long ago going back 1000s of years this is how *most*
people lived.

fwiw I agree that this guy probably can't (and shouldn't) make it
work.
