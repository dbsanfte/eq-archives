    been reading the posts and have heard alot of great suggestions, but i
think (notice i say think, i too am kinda new) that it really depends on the
group.  me and my friend, for example, just go bomb around lavastorm looking
for whatever we can find and then beat the hell out of it.  this works for
me cuz i am a necro and can cast DoT spells and then just meditate while him
and my pet do the rest.  i guess this would be your "roaming" group.
    my other favorite group is with me (necro), a couple of my beastlord
friends, and a cleric.  we all go to the west commonlands and sit by a camp
(i think its called cut throat??? anyway, a camp of all light blues, blues,
and an occasional yellow).  we wait for them to spawn and then we tell
someone to "pull," knowing quite well that its next to impossible to pull
just one and in about 2 seconds we're gonna have about 5 or 6 cut throats
(or is it deathfist?  oh, wait...that's the orcs...) attacking us all at
once, with the occasional young kodak who was just passing by.  ANYWHO...by
the end of the fight we are all out of mana and at about 40% health and
saying things like "damn!" and "close one" or even "that was hella fun!"
after that, we all sit and meditate until we're at full health/mana and the
enemies have respawned.  then go at it again.  (there are quite a few deaths
in this kind of group, but you can still rake in the xp)

so i guess my point is this:
we could sit here for days posting back and forth about different kinds of
groups, but i think the best kind is the kind where you just hook up with
some friends and beat the shiitake mushrooms out of anything that comes your
way.  HAVE FUN!!!

PS
whats the name of that camp in the West Commonlands with the ogres and
barbarians (or are they humans??? i can't tell the difference)
