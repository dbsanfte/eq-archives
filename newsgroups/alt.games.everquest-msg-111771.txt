get the help I need to get my epic maybe some of the people that have jobs
and cant spend 14 hours straight camping a rare spawn or 2 days to get to
island 7 in air will understand and if you dont i dont care you probably
dont play on my server anyway and if you do your not in my guild or else you
would have said something when i was discussing it with them. I dont group I

access to my account. I wasn't looking for smart ass comments with that post
