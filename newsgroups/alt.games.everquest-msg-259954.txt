This brings up a pet peeve of mine: spawn points.  I don't think games
should let you see things spawn.  They should spawn out of site, and then,
if there is some area they are suppose to be in, move to that area.

CoH does something like that, I believe, although they don't move.  It
apparently simply doesn't use a spawn point if there is someone near it.

(Speaking of CoH...it took my about 10 levels before I noticed that mobs
don't move except during combat.  In EQ or DAoC, I would have noticed right
away if the mobs didn't move...but for some reason it just didn't stand out
in CoH).
