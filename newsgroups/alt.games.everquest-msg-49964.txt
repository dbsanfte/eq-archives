yes, this is what i used to do all the time but now doesnt work.

all that will happen is the view will look straight up and if i hold mouse
button and move mouse the clouds will just revolve.

any more suggestions please?

reinstalling game?
moving my *.opt files?
maybe deleting ocean of tears files, where i think this phenomenon first
reared its ugly head?
contacting sony?

i cant go on like this.

for example

if i ve hit a mob with a spell and am running to my pet. before, i used to
hit "change view key" 4 times, then using right mouse button held down i
would move mouse to change camera angle so that i could see both me and mob
chasing me. so as to be able to judge if i had enough clearance to get
another spell off. now, i have to do a quick 180 and run backwards, which is
a bit slower than forwards, thus losing time.

to sit down and wait for boat i have to actually sit in the direction the
boat is coming. intead of just sitting in any direction, hitting change view
key 4 times etc

the key - map would be great.
