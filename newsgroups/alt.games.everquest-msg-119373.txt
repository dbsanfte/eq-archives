  Yes, but they may not be all that magic resistent, which means they could
be mezzed.  Then it would just be a matter of killing a bunch of level 60
creatures one at a time.  Even if they are severe undercons, level 60 mobs
are hunted almost as a matter of routine everyday.  I doubt raiding the
Qeynos sewers would be as difficult as killing Tunare or perhaps even bosses
in the older planes.  I'd wager that two groups of well equipped level 60
characters could clear out the sewers if they tried hard enough.
