:> understand.  Whatever the logic behind allowing a caster to bind

Why expect logic in a roleplaying game, that strongly relies on classes?
The skills are just distributed like that (I would argue on logic within
a skillset or spells, but that's soemthing else :) ). I mean, what's
the logic by which I can wield on sword but not the other? Wear one
helmet but not the other? Why can I only walk to an area by using a Zone?
Why do Lizards have a swimming bonus? Why do mobs respawn at all?

:> anywhere and making everyone else bind in some other location,  at
:> times in a different zone,  has always seemed a bit unfair.

I'd LOVE to be able to bind anywhere with my SK twink. I just can't.
Then again, my Shaman can't wield my SK's super axe. Why not? Does
he have no hands?

: Anyways, it comes down to the fact that binding was always a major nuisance,
: and now that's mostly fixed.

Not a change I mind, either.
