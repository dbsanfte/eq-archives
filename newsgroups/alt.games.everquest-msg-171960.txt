    See my other post for more on this subject. But reading this makes me
wonder how completely incompetent these group leaders have to be.

    Take Mr. "STFU and play manasong". Surely it wouldn't take much for the
bard to show that he's capable of playing manasong AND other songs at the
same time, would it? Is this leader so stupid that, faced with evidence that
the bard can both play manasong AND do other things, he'd still insist on
only manasong? That's why I have some problems with accepting what you've
said at face value. I just can't see a group leader being such a moron that
he can't see what's right in front of his face. I compare that with my
experiences with bards, some of whom just don't realize that their manasong
is a huge boost to my mana production which is pure downtime mitigation (and
likely the only pure downtime mitigation), whereas their offensive buffs are
minor additions to toal group offensive output and thus don't mitigate
downtime as well. When a bard doesn't play manasong they damned well better
be mitigating damage directly, like mezzing, or there'll be one angry dwarf
on them!
