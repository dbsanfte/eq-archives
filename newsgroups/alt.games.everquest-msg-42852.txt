The normal "evil" route to Kunark is off a raft in Oasis to Timorous
deep, then cross the island it stops on to a dock where you catch
the Bloated Belly ship to Overthere.

Better, if you can invis, is to take either the BB shuttle or Oasis raft
to TD, then swim to the Firepots room and tap the tall gold vase,
which will port you to Cabalis next to the LOIO zone, out of aggro
range of the guards.  Invis up and zone out, then leave the guarded
newbie area while your invis is still on, no worries.  Personally, I bound
myself inside the city there at the port in spot... don't try that if your
invis came in a bottle!
