Can you afford phone #2? Or DSL/cable? That would keep wife happy. If 
you can't and she needs it for her business... log off now and don't 
look back. Real life faction is WAAAY more important than the game.

If you can keep that faction positive, then and only then consider the 
POP and LOY expansions. LOY is worth it for the extra bank space, POP is 
for the easy ports.
