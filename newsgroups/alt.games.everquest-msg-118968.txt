Actually, I tried both before I bought both.  Again, you are making
assumptions about my life that you really have no backing to make.  A
couple of posts 3 years ago really doesn't give you the whole picture, so
why do you make so many assumptions?  You seem to cut out just about
everything I say in response to you, and then write that I said something
different or stronger than what I actually said.  Show me where I said "I
NEVER" as you quoted from me.
