Clickies are your friend.  I have clicky Abolish Disease, and clicky 
Remove Greater Curse, as well as swappable equipment for clicky Swift 
Like the Wind.  I need to get clicky root one of these days too.

In general though, I keep one spell slot as my general purpose swap in 
whatever I need for this occasion slot, and a few others that I do swap 
for raiding vs xping with a group, or soloing.  Mind you, I don't have as 
many heals to choose from, I keep two memmed all the time, but, I do have 
debuffs and such that I keep handy instead.

1. Malos
2. Root (nonraid) or Malosinia (raid)
3. Yoppas Mending
4. Utility slot (Malicious decay, buff slot, anything else I need 
situationally)
5. Cannibalize
6. Poison DoT or Ferine Avatar situationally
7. Turgurs Insects
8. Quiescence (until I get my level 70 HoT)
9. Sisslak (curse based DoT)

Only ones of those that I never swap out are 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, the rest are 
situationally swapped when I know what to expect.
