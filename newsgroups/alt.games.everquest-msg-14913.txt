Is there a trivial level to spells like there is with skills such as
tailoring? I tried casting true north repeatedly (20 times maybe) and never
got a bump in skill level. My divination skill is over 50 but the current
cap is like 90 or so for my level so I'm way behind. Must I cast higher
level div spells to get my skill up?
