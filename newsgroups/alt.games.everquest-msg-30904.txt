On Sullon Zek, ks'ing is not a /petitionable offense.

How you take care of guys like that, if you cannot defeat them in PvP
combat, is to roleplay in their presence.

The jerks of the server (which I'm seeing less of all the time) cannot stand
roleplaying, especially if you talk of an alliance between Neuts and Good to
defeat Evil.  Talk about it in front of them until they get pissed off and
start cussing.  Then /report them.

It's helped thin out the hardcore EverQuakers real quick.
