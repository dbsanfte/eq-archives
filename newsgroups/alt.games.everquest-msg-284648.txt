The beauty of this scam is that it relies on the fact that accounts are 
considered non transferable by SOE, so anyone but the original owner is 
in violation if they are on the account.

I'd think that to stomp out the scam, and the trade in general, SOE 
would also ban the original owner since he "allowed" someone else to 
access the account, which is a violation, in fact I seem to recall them 
doing just this to someone who claimed they had been hacked.

On reflection, though, perhaps letting the scammers get away with it is 
really in their best interest, since this means that everyone buying 
accounts is constantly at risk of losing them, which should help deter 
potential customers, and at the same time, they don't lose the revenue 
stream since someone is always paying the monthly rate; ban the account 
and the money stops coming in from it.

If I were running this scam, the address would be phony and the phone 
would be a throwaway cell (you can buy them at wallmart very cheaply 
these days)

Even if you really can track the guy down, I'm dubious about how 
successful you'd be at prosecuting, since you were involved in an 
illicit transaction.  Can you sue your drug dealer if he turns out to 
have sold you a bag of oregano?  Can you sue a hit man for killing the 
wrong man?  Can you sue your bookie when he fails to pay off when your 
100 to 1 shot horse comes in?
