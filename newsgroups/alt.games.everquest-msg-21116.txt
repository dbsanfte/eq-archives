Subject: What is Fear Kiting?

I have a level 8 Necromancer (Dark elf) and read in a guide on the web that i
should hunt at the skeleton ruins in nektolous forest. The guy said i could
'fear kite' the mobs one at a time with ease. As it is, i just ward undead the
toughest and all pile on me (well, my pet), i cant seem to pull one without the
others joining in. This tactic works ok, but i was wondering what and how do i
fear kite them individually? I dont use the fear spell often and feel by not
knowing exactly what kiting is im missing out on a good strategy.
Cheers :)
