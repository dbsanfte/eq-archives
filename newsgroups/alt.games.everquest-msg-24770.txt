No, just like hidding or invisibility or gather shadows. Someone else
mentioned sneak which is good. I have done the rogue quest with a halfling
druid by using treeform. I have heard about wolf form/share wolf form being
KOS in Halas so it doesn't appear to be an option.

If it will work for you I think the first step would be the gnoll furs.
Haven't tried it yet, but gnoll fur quest is triggered by talking to the
rogue GM and when he responds the female rogue gives the key phrase [gnoll
furs] or fur. The mammoth hide quest needs better faction then the gnoll
furs so you could try just using the phrase on the female and see what she
says. I turned in 3 gnoll fur bundles to her as a tree, ~200 pieces sewn
together, and that just got me up high enough in apprehensive to do more
gnoll furs w/o having to turn tree.
