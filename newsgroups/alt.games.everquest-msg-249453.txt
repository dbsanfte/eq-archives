The trouble with conspiracy theorists is that they read too much into 
everything.

I agree with a number of the non-technical points they made ... the lack 
of blood for example (having seen chickens slaugtered I can attest to 
the amount of blood being lacking). Some of the points are technical and 
those shoudl be left ot hte experts. And some of the points I have no 
qualification to judge... accents, mannerisms, etc.

And some of the points are suggestive, but it wrong to attach too much 
meaning too them... e.g. the colour of the walls... the type of chair.

The clip was obviously manipulated, but that doesn't by itself imply a 
hoax. But it raises enough doubt in my mind that I would want proper 
investigation done. Sadly... I have no idea who i would really trust to 
do the investigation...

If it was an American ploy then that is the sickest thing I've ever 
seen. Whether they shot the guy and then beheaded him or beheaded him 
live. Manufacturing public outrage to distract from real issues is a 
gross violation of the trust people place in their governement.

If it was in fact a terrorst 'execution', but it turns out they killed 
him first and then beheaded him... its still an atrocity... but not 
quite on the scale you originally claimed... they aren't quite the 
monsters you labelled them... and in light of what our own soldiers have 
done... even you might concede we're perhaps the greater monsters...not 
to mention hypocrites because we went in claiming moral superiority 
while they have claimed all along that they were prepared to commit 
those acts.

If it was in fact what it has been represented as, then there are a 
number of anomalies that would require satisfactory resolution before 
I'm prepared to accept it at face value.
