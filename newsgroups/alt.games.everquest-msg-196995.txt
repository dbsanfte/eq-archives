      You could go back to the zone and ask for the help of a shadow knight,
necromancer, or bard. they have the abilities to track corpses. most will do
it for free but i usually donate if i have to ask for help.

  Also what server do you happen to be on? If its saryrn or the firiona vie
servers i could help you with my necro or beastlord.
