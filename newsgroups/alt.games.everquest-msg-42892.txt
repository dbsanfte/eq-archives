Yes, many people do. Up to the 8th ring can be done with 2-3 people, if
they know what they are doing.

To start? Not very. You need to work up several tradeskills however.

The 10th ring requires major raid level participation. 30-50 high level,
well equipped, disciplined people.

For any melee class, and for necromancers and shamans, the 10th ring
represents a best-in-game item. Better than most of their epics, really.

The rings are primarily made to be worn by melees, but because of how
useful the 8+ rings are, lots of other classes use them as well.

Caster classes have the shawl quests, which are currently stalled at
#7...presumably it will also get to a #10.
