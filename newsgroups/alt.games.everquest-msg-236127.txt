-Basicly work on your abilities.

-There is a bug with the pick lock ability so you will have to dump like
10pts into it before you can get it to work on the door in Befallen.
-For safe fall its good to run up and down the steep cliffs of EC. You'll
get 4 or 5 good falls out of it on your way down.

-Dont worry too much about Pick pockets(when your soloing go ahead and level
it up or if your in a group that dosent seem too worried about looting ask
if you can PP if they say yes Knock yourself out)

-Get a hot button worked out to Hide and sneak at the same time(known as
evade).
/attack off
/doability 1 [hide]
/doability 2 [sneak]
You are then basicly invisable ..with a very slow move rate.
When you get good at it it helps out in group situations .Like when the mob
spins around to face you in a fight.Hit the evade hot button and if
successful he will loose intrest and turn back to the tank..then continue
backstabbing.

-If you ignore bandaging like I used to get that up, it is quite handy.

-Get a fast peircing weapon and I've been told a 1hs for your secondary.

Thats all I can think of right now..but my rogue is just 15th lev right now
so there is still alot I will need to learn.
