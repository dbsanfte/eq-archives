 It's not something you'd probably use since it cancels magic on the
wielder. It's main purpose is that it's a quest item for, I think, Iksar
Warrior armor.

 I think he's level 40. When I fought him he always tried to slow me. As
long as I wasnt slowed I wouldn't have much of a problem with him as a
monk. If he got slow to stick I'd just feign and try again once I
regenned to full.


 The best place to fight him is to probably pull him to the left back
corner. I usually didn't get adds when I fought him there.

 Also, unless they changed it, he doesn't always drop the prod. If he's
wielding it he'll drop it.
