Just did a check on Lavastorm tonight ~ 8pm, and there were 5 players 
that were over 25th but none higher.

I can tell you one thing for sure, killing mobs doesn't get you the exp 
that you can get by doing quests.  Just by doing my mage final test in 
the mage tower I leveled twice during the test which was to kill 5 
creatures in sequence and at your own pace.  Went from 8th to 10th by 
killing just those 5.  I also leveled to 12th tonight just by locating a 
building in Antonica.  They've geared the game to be much more quest 
rewarding then by sitting in a cave killing recondites for a few hours.

The second rewarding feature is the tradeskills.  If you are just 
remotely interested in tradeskills the ease of use and the actual fun of 
doing it is outstanding.  It's a whole different game.  Also, locating 
the different items to harvest is super nice and easy.  No standing 
around a zone for hours moving a few feet then /forage, repeat to 
infinity...

I couldn't imagine anyone playing EQ2 and saying, 'well it's ok, I'm 
going to play EQ1 instead.'  For people the deciding factor is going to 
be the hardware requirements.  They're steep, I'm using a GeForce 4 Ti 
4400 and it's choking on the high performance setting.  To counter this 
I just picked up an Athlon64 and GeForce FX 6600 GT which should take 
care of all my problems.  I don't mean to discourage anyone here.  If 
you can play eq with all the expansions and not choke too bad in a nice 
sized raid, you'll be able to play EQ2 fine just with lower settings is 
all.  You don't loose on the gameplay at all and that's what makes it an 
awesome game.
