Because clerics get their heals 5 levels lower than other
priest classes (up to 34, then 17 levels lower) they can
consistently get groups where they are of a substantially
lower level than the rest of the group - resulting in incredible
xp per hour.  As a 24 cleric I kept a group of 29-31 level
characters healed in M. Seru during nearly nonstop pulls,
while getting 2+ yellow an hour (less than 6 hours, 13yellow).
