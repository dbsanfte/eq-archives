Do you have PoP?  If so, give Kurn's Tower a try.  The blue skeletons on the
first floor will give about a blue of XP each, and the occasional even or
yellow will give more.  I think you'd have no trouble with them, especially
if you take some advantage of their weird pathing to get an extra couple of
nukes in on the tougher ones. :-)  With PoP, Kurn's is very accessible.
