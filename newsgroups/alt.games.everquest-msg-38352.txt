I'll go so far as to say DB enabled wizards are gods at end game
encounters.

Think of it this way:

Dragon's bane is 2000hps of unresistable damage with abnormally low
aggro.  You can chain cast this from start to finish and still remain
very low on the dragon's aggro list as long as you have tanks meleeing
it.

Get 4 dragon baned wizards grouped with a necro and bard.  Have a mage
feeding them mana rods.

Each wizard *should* be able to punch out 15DBs at least, 20DB is
common per wizard.

That's 30khps of damage per wizard minimum, 40khps common.  Four DB
wizards will account for 120khps to 160khps.

Basically *ONE* group of players was able to generate about 50% of
Yelinak's hitpoints.

But until they get to level 60 and get DB, wizards are pretty useless
except in VP.
