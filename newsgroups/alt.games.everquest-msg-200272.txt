One bit of advice. Someone may have been in there before you and failed to
kill Tserrina on the top floor after they spawned her. She can summon. ToFS
is made up of several floors but it is all one zone, so you can be summoned
from the 1st floor. It happened to our group once, an enchanter in his early
40's got summoned from near the mirrors on the 1st floor and didn't live
long enough to /gsay Where the f*ck am I? :)

If you bring along a ranger, druid or bard, check what's on track when you
zone in.
