If you are afraid of dying with all your stuff on PUT IT IN THE BANK!  Now run
around to your hearts content.  If you die you'll pop right back up in
Rivervale with all your stuff safe:)  And there's a bank in most major areas so
once you find somewhere you want to play just find the bank and get bound there
and explore.
Next: print some maps from EQ Atlas.  West Commons is just a couple zones away.
 Karanas is a little trickier but SO PRETTY, very much worth the journey. 
There are SO many places to visit, once you go you'll never regret it.
