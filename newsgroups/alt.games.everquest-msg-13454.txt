Falling damage is dependent on weight and distance.  I have heard of people
taking 10,000 pts from zoning because they were so overloaded they needed
Jboots to even crawl.  Should have stacked a lev on that overloadedness.

I have seen a raid evac where four people died on the TP because they AFKed
and when they came back they had bounced for a little too many times and
died.

It happens.

Best solutions: Lev for TP if heavy, and never AFK on a TP or Zone.  Get off
the landing zone ASAP for the sake of the poor fool who TPs after you.
