Yes my friend, you do have a choice. You have always had that choice. 
That I feel is one of the greatest gifts, God has given us. But we as 
humans, often do misuse this wonderful gift. I am not sure what you mean 
to do what you are capable of. But stop and look at it. What you are 
capable of doing, is a talent that God has instilled in you. Use this 
wonderful gift to praise his name.

There is nothing wrong in wanted a girlfriend. That is why God made 
woman, as a help mate, partner, someone to keep us company. But again, 
man has ruined this great gift from God, I feel.

This voice you claim to hear, may not be the voice of God, but the voice 
of Satan. It could be the voice of God, I do not know. Yes making 
mistakes is life, and we are to learn from those mistakes. I am not 
saying anything about you running the world, because I have no thoughts 
on that. But finally getting what you want and not spending one day in 
hell. I do have a couple things to state or ask. What you want, is it 
what God wants you have? Are you doing all of this to Glorify God, or 
yourself? And as for Hell, are you saved, have you turned your life over 
to God. Have you accepted his Son as your Lord and Savior? That is the 
only thing that will keep you out of the Lake of Fire. Good works have 
nothing to do with it.
May you have a wonderful day, and God bless you
Larry
