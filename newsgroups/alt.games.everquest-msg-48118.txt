Richard,

Granted they may not persue anything if the distribution is done, but, I
only wished to debate or inform even that it is against the EULA and
copyright law.  The reason why it infringes against the actual EULA (which
is most cases -IS- different) is that in the beginning (on top) if I'm not
mistaken, is the presentation that the software is protect under those very
copyright laws that we both speak of.

As I said somewhere in this thread.  I actually do not care if someone gives
him the files.  However, I did want to make them aware (just looking out for
peeps) that it was against copyright laws and the EULA.  Nothing more. :)
