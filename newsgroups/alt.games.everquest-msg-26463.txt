Personally playing a Druid character I haven't had many problems at all.
I've had very isolated incidents of people begging for equipment or money
but otherwise people have been really good. In fact I'd say that in my
experience people asking for buffs or teleports have usually said somethng
like "happy to donate" or even offered a price in pp for the task ( looking
at the /shout and /ooc channels )

I figure if these people get ignored they'll leave you alone after a bit so
if I get someone begging in an impolitel fashion I just don't respond. They
soon go elsewhere.
