That would prevent people using it at level 1.

No Drop encourages people to play the game. The idea is that the top
end items are obtained by hunting in the various dungeons and planes
that drop them, not safely selling kei in in the bazaar, or farming
giants in rathe.

If you want a Time Item you have to go to Time... if you want a LDoN
item you have to play LDoN etc...

It isn't 'realistic'... buts its part of the *game*. One of the last
vestiges of the 'vision' really, and one worth keeping.

I will agree that no drop items should have utility once you are done
with them though.. turn them in for faction, plat, augments, "tribute
points"... whatever... its stupid that they become garbage the moment
you find an upgrade.
