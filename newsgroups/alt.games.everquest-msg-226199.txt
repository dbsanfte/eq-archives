When it's the primary question of your considering return, as your
post clearly implied, then it's perfectly natural to draw the
conclusion that loading times are what drove you away in the first
place. If you don't want people to draw their own conclusions from
your posts, then be clear about the reasons. Otherwise, patronizing
for people's conclusions being incorrect is rather ridiculous.

>Also wanted to ask why all the 65's in the original EQ zones

LDoN Wayfarer's camps and dungeon zone-ins. Not like this part was
that hard to figure out yourself.
