Color me pissed.

Even though I've never been a customer of Excite@home, their problems
appear to be spilling over onto me, simply because I have the
misfortune of using AT&T Broadband.

My cable provider *used* to be MediaOne, then was switched to AT&T.
Never in there did I use Excite. But as of sometime late Friday night,
my connection got clipped.

Of course, calls to AT&T to find out what gives are a completely
wasted effort. Half the tries I made, I never even got a busy signal -
just some weird error messages from the trunk line. 

And when I do manage to get through, AT&T doesn't let your call get
routed to a human, at all. No matter what numbers you hit, you end up
at a message saying you'll be reconnected within a week.

Right. Sure. Uh-huh. 

So even if my disconnect situation isn't a direct result of the Excite
fiasco, I can't talk to a tech about it anyway. So I'm reduced to
operating through a really crappy dialup service that my employer
provides. It only took me about four tries to get it to connect.

Crap, Crap, Crap.
