I do.

There is always a risk of pulling more adds when the FoL'd mob goes
running off so you have to know the area you are fighting in and mob
behavior.

I use it mostly as an agro spell in group situations. Since BLs don't
get taunt, hitting a mob with a disease spell and FoL does wonders for
getting their attention.

When soloing FoL comes in real handy. It never seems to last much more
than 15-20 seconds. This is generally enough time to finish the first
mob off or beat it down enough that I am ready for the returning one.
Saves me a lot of mana on pet heals.

It is a great "get out of Ranger-gate free" spell when things hit the
fan. FoL back off then head for the zone. 

I find it usefull enough to keep it memmed all the time. Your mileage
may vary of course :)
