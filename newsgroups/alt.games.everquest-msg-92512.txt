The following is from the standpoint of a level 29 bard.  That's a
good four song twist if you have a small group with a caster in it. 
Unless you have really good weapons, you will probably do more damage
over the course of the fight with CoD.  I strictly use instruments
most of the time, unless I'm in a group setting where most of the
songs I need to use are using the "singing" skill.  If you keep
practicing your punching skill, you'll be surprised how much damage
you do over the course of the fight.  I do about 5hp of damage with my
punch, but when I'm twisting chains, hymn, CoD, and DDD with my
punching, that's a lot of output.  That 5hp damage really does add up.
 That is typically my four song twist if I'm grouped with one other
melee class.  In a larger group, I'll typically twist anthem, largo's
(or chains if there is no "snarer"), mana, and Psalm of Warmth (for
Cold resist & dmg shield).  I'll usually dual wield at this point
because all of those songs (if I'm not mistaken) use the "singing"
skill.  If going against casters, I'd probably opt to twist hymn,
elemental rhythms, guardian rhythms, and either CoD, DDD, Pixie, or
Largo's.  With that twist I'd be swapping my lute, drum, and wind
instrument.  That twist really keeps me busy.

I hope that helps with that question.
