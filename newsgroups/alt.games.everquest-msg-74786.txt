It definitely is the case.

That's how it *was*.  When they removed class-based XP penalties, they
also changed the split to be level-based rather than XP-based.  The
share for group member u in an n person group is now simply

	Lu / (L1 + L2 + ... + Ln),

where Li is the level of the i'th group member.  It used to be
something like this:

	Eu / (E1 + E2 + ... + En),

where Ei is the total experience of the i'th group member.
