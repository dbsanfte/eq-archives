Well, I had a few ideas, then I noticed you're on my server. =D

5th floor ToFS is profitable, as are the Grey named spawns, I've also had
fairly good luck with the Skyfire cycle for some spells.

Or what I used to do while doing IGs with a friend around level 40 or so (me
that is) and run into Permafrost and check the named spawns and gank them
for loot (Alchemist, Archaeologist and Preacher), kill the PH if the names
weren't up, and go back to IGs.
