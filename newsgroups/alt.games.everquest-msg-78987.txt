You've got it wrong. What's misunderstood is the perception that being
evil is a *bad* thing.

I channel a lot of my own anger into my shadow knight, so she suits
the Innoruuk thing. That and her fashion-obsessiveness (shared by all
my girls) started turning towards 'ice queen sexpot bitch goddess'
relatively early on. Then, she decided eating raw meat was tacky
rather than evil cool, and learned to bake. She also learned to judge
others by their own valor instead of only by their race (even the
inferior can have some honor) and even though she doesn't usually have
chunks of meat to give them anymore and hasn't gotten around to
gathering ingredients for cannibalistic dishes, she still thanks those
who aid her with 'May Innoruuk devour your enemies'.

Her necromancer partner doesn't seem to mind when she models different
armors (except helms, they mess up her hair - which she refuses to dye
black even if he thinks that'd look cool), but for some reason, he
seems to get jealous when she calls exhumed gnolls and such cute. He's
a pretty good healer, though; a *very* useful skill for a non-soloing
necromancer.

In two more levels or so, we move from aviaks (stupid birds), gnolls
(stupid dogs) and hermits (stupid druids) to treants (stupid plants).
Life is good, and so is the death of others.
