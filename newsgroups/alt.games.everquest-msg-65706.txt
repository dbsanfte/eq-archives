"They're buying old product. You can't honestly think Verant is going
to pull old boxes off the shelves, can you?

Very likely the shelf boxes will be updated to reflect the new
minimums. "

I do expect them to pull the boxes, or at least make their game work under
conditions that the box says it will.

And to the person who was talking about how everquest doesnt run on dos or win
3.0, because they are out dated, thats irrelevant. The boxes dont list those
os' as min specs.
