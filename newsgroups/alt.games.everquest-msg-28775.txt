I'm not sure if my problem is the same as the one you are having.  I too was
being dropped to the desk top continuously.  I had the everquest down in my
task bar though I was not able to do the "alt/tab to switch back into the
game, I was able to "hear" everything in the game just as if I was still
there but in actuality I was not.  Nothing else would respond.  I'd do
"ctrl/alt/del" and have to do this several times each time ending task on
everquest before it would actually close out of the game to allow me to
relog back into it again.
Well, after doing this process over and over again, I tried shutting down
everything possible in the "close programs" window and realized that **every
single time I was thrown out of the game and back to the desktop, I would
have something called "BACKWEB AGENT" running in the task manager, and this
wasn't there when I logged into the game.  I finally removed this from my
system completely and since removal. I have not been kicked out of the game
and back to the desktop even once.
Hope this may be of some help to you.
