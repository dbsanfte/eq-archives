...The same way that guild officers mentally "quantify things
like that" when *not* doing a points system, and instead
use the "officers decide awards" system.  Either way
contributions need to be weighed and evaluated.

At least with a real points system, everyone can see and
understand who has earned what -- and why and how.  With the
"no points" systems (which invariably work on a hidden subjective
"brownie points" system), no one's quite sure why someone's
getting an award, and rumors of favoritism are easily raised;
not to mention complaints from people who think that their recent
contributions are being undervalued or forgotten.

With a true points system, members can be assured of being 
awarded commensurate with what they feel their contributions 
are worth (or can elect not to do them if the award seems too 
meager).  With a points system everything is "above board".

There are many ways to handle point sinks, such as the inclusion
of bidding actions.  As point totals grow, so do the average
bids, which then suck up a larger pile of points.  Done right
it achieves its own equilibrium.

No "HUGEr" than the identical issues that arise under
"officer choice" award systems.  There, too, you have to
ponder which activities are going to gain you "deserves something"
consideration from the folks handing out the loot.

What do you "get for it" *now*?

It would of course be a mistake to make *every* guild-related
activity a "point earning" activity.  But I haven't seen anyone
propose that.  Many things people do for their guildmates ought
to be done for the usual reasons (being considerate, returning
favors, a new adventure, helping others so they'll help you
when you need it, etc. etc.)  I don't see why the guild leaders
would *need* to put loot/point awards on such things to keep
them happening.  Points which are intended to "buy" raid loot
or personal raids should be awarded only for things relating
to raids (attendance, helping in the planning, etc.), or
for the "it's a dirty job but someone has to do it" tasks
of guild management which ought to bring the poor schmuck who
does it day in and day out *some* sort of compensation.

Ouch.

But I'd like to point out that a real points system would have
ensured that she didn't "receive loot well out of whack with her
attendance" (or other contributions).

Unlike "officers award" systems, a points system won't
cave in to the whines, nags, demands, or foot-stomping of
prima donnas just to buy a short-term bit of peace.  With a
points system everyone is clearly playing under the same rules.
The whiners can't play the "I've got the lion's share but I
deserve more" game, since the points are an objective system.

Such is life.
