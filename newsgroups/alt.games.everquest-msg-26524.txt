Well, in all fairness, while I was providing a lot of pro-guild conversational
points, and Biz certainly took a typical over-the-top nasty response, I'll be the
first to admit that there was a definite element of hostility in it when I went
back and re-read it.  A lot of people on the other side of this debate try to take
the smug route and blow such situations off as "envy", or, as I guess Biz chooses
to term it, "Druid Worship".  Beats me. I guess we hang out in different places.
I've just had too many run-ins with too many idiots playing the class. Maybe just a
run of bad luck? Who knows. Currently, we've been spending a lot of time in Rath
Mtns.  As I'm sure you know, this is apparently *Heaven* for Druid Farming.  And if
they were all actually *GOOD* at doing it, it would be fine.  But the only times
we've died there in weeks were when druids _attempting_ to kite multiple giants
dragged them over our pull/med area.  (And we purposely moved to a spot well off
the "run for your life, TRAIN!" paths.  But it's a big zone full of rich mobs.
Ideal for the little doggies to go kite them all over the place. And they do, with
seemingly little regard for anybody else. If you try to complain to them about it
and ask them to watch their kite path, it's generally, "Too fucking bad. /rude".
  And I've also had my fair share, recently, of grouping with Druids who suddenly
realize that they need more than one person to get into certain zones in the post
40 game to try for particular items. Idiots. Almost every last one of them. And it
was obvious that they had solo'd for forty levels and had no clue about grouping.
  Does it apply to all druids? Certainly not. Most? Probably not either. As I said,
maybe I've just had a run of extremely bad luck. But yeah, a lot of them seriously
suck ass, so I guess I've come off with a bit of an attitude.  My apologies in
advance to all of you Druids out there who *do* know how to responsibly kite and
didn't solo your whole career, have spent some fair time grouping and have a clue.
