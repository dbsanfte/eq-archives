    I think that holds truer (?) of clerics than other casters. Crowd
control particularly in that sort of zone has to be able to land root or
mezz, and the slower needs to be able to land slow. Heals don't get
resisted. I remember a lot of shocking planar group experiences that were
the result of either the crowd control or slower being too low level to
reliably do their job - it's a large reason why I ended up using the "bring
back a single or die" policy on pulls.

    And yeah, even DPS classes eat resists and/or do far less damage at
lower levels.
