Not much point to create the cultural armors for yourself. As a caster AC
doesn't mean much and none of the items has +int. I don't have a good list
of the stats of the items (EQTraders doesn't list the stats afaik; and
allakhazam doesn't list the normal items, only the imbued versions) but I
even doubt if you can use 1 or 2 items.

It's a good trade for making a bit of money later on though. I might pick it
up myself. Or tailoring. Not sure yet.
