I've twinked quite a bit in my time.  I think I've played every char (except
chanter, and shaman) up to lvl 15 at least.  I've twinked some and didn't on
others.  I had fun both ways, I didn't feel bad about it -- it was my time
and my gear.

Surprisingly enough, the bard that I PL with the GL quest was the only one
that was ever accused of being a twink and she wasn't.  I just liked half
elf bard in bronze with hero bracers and a barbut.  She was level 9 though,
:)
