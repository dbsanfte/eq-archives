I spoke to the guys before we kill the ph, it worked, 15 or 20 min later (if
i remember well) Lord poped
I dont know if the next pop can be triggered until something pop or must be
triggered before the ph die.
I cant ensure Lord WILL pop, maybe i was just lucky, but in doubt, speak to
him BEFORE killing ph :)

Good luck.
