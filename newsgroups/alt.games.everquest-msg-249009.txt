Its no big surprise SOE would launch a gimick like this in the shadwos of other and better RPGs. GoD was a frikking joke to
everyone. The total waste of AAXPs in GoD was just too much for most of us hardcore players. Alot of us sold our accounts moved on.
SOE is just fighting for the scraps now. Blame the game designers, its their fault entirely.
