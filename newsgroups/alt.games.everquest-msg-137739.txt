The explaination of my complaint was correct

It was also intended humorously, in the style of the many
people who complain about this and that with every
patch... perhaps a smiley emote would have helped ;)

A few hours of players online post patch with my
trader not active are really not worth worrying
about, particularly when you consider that the
only reason I can do this at all is the incredibly
useful new /bazaar and /trader functionality
added by a very recent patch.
