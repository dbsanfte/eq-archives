There isn't one, it's personal choice. Warrior is pretty much the weakest
class in the game but don't expect any class rebalancing to be applied,
Verant, along time ago, made it clear that the balancing of the classes
applies to the end game levels (where the Cleric changes have been applied)
and encounters, in this Role the Warrior sits above all others thanks to one
discipline (or so it would seem to me) and as such doesn't warrant any
changes.

Usual arguements to these "balancing" changes come out from the warrior camp
"WTF..you now get this and that and this and can do this better than us and
could always do that better than us" and these are then met with the same
response "shut ya whining! You get defensive"
So there you go, you may be the laughing stock of Norrath and it's Moons
(don't think anyone lives on the other but if they did they'd laugh at
Warriors) and be permanently considered a Meat Shield, a damage absorber,
cannon fodder but you get defensive, so quit ya whining.
