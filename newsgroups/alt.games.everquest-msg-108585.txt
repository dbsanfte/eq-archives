/pause 3,/auction WTS item, some stats - xxxpp
/pause 3,/auction WTS item2, stat stat - xxxpp
/pause 3,/auction WTS item3, stat stat - xxxpp

Up to five lines

Some folks here will say doing this is a bad
thing, and you should put all your stuff on
one line and use <shift>+<Up arrow> <enter>.

Thing is, when I'm reading auctions, and things
are moving pretty fast - I don't read long lines.

OTOH - I can scan a single line for item name
and price as fast as it can go by.  

Just don't repeat it every 10 seconds.  Once 
every couple or three minutes is fine.
