Well, there seems to be about 5 HG's up at any given time and they're
on a 6 minute timer (I think!), that would be 40 to 50 HG's an hour.
If you play VERY late it is possible to be the only one there
occasionally.

Now, my druid can't kill all the HG's at once (I haven't tried
quadding them yet..... hurm....) but I've seen necro's do four at a
time without breaking a sweat and ending the fight at BETTER than 50%
mana.

Friggin Necro's.
