There is an old saying;

Your problem is, that you have a ten-gallon hat,

Thats all very nice, but the term that was under
discussion was roleplaying, not acting.

This time you changed the topic.

I suspect your definition of acting will become as
nebulous as your definition of roleplaying, as

You can't even be bothered to go back one post and
look to see what you are supposed to be talking
about.

You are a clod of inordinate proportions.
