You won't be able to harmonize an already aggro'd MOB.  It is used to lower
the aggro radius to 10ft of a MOB that isn't fighting yet.  The way to use
it most of the time is to break a camp (ie one of the orc camps in WC).
Cast Harmony on a MOB near the center of the group and then pull the MOB
closest to you.  As long as it doesn't path too close to any others, you
should only pull that one, not the entire group.
