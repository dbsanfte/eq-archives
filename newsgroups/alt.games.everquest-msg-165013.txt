EQCompanion running to parse in the background while staying within
range of the melee brawl to see the numbers.

The ferocity/2hb monk seemed to have a far wider 'spread' of damage
than the primal monk. Primal monk was consistently around 100-120
dps, the ferocity/2hb monk, however, was running from 95 to (and I
kid you not, this number came up about 5 times) 175dps. He was
delighted, as a rogue in the same guild had been mocking him. The
rogue pretty regularly gets 180dps using tendonslicer and some other
lunatic toy.

All in all they generally parsed out pretty much evenly with the
difference being in the order of that you'd expect from bad positioning
(5-10 dps) and the occsional 'omg that was nuts' damage from mr
no-primal. He wasnt using disciplines either, which was what I'd
initially thought was going on.

The funniest thing was his delight because he had *also* decided
'no primal = suck' without parsing to check.

It was in PoV fighting golems, arachnids and crawlers. The 2h monk
was using what looked like a translucent grey staff with a crescent
blade at the end. The other had primal wristwraps, I think. I didnt
enquire, because honestly I didnt much care. I was just chatting
to the monk, not expecting to use it as a basis for a Usenet post.
I still have the logs though, so I might be able to extract more
information from there if theres anything beyond slash/bash/punch.

It does. He had ferocity 3 and punishing blade ... 2? I think.
Anyway, the point was; no primal does not equal suck. This monk had
no primal and consistently solid DPS with occsaional bursts of
extremely good DPS.
