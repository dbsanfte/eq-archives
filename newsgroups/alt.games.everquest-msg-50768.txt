Well, as a shaman in a group, I am basically spending all my time sitting
and meditating, so swapping spells around as needed is not that big a deal.
While soloing, I swap buffs in and out of one slot as needed.

As for yours:

spells 1, 2, 3, and 11 you just swap in and out as needed, no need to keep
them memmed all the time.  Same goes for 7 and 8, probably just use the same
slot as you do for buffs, that leaves 6 spells memorized, plus one or two
slots that you swap buffs and/or gate/circle spells in and out of.  Is it
really that difficult to do?
