I have patcher version 1.0.30. The default folder is C:\Program
Files\Sony\Everquest.  My son is in bed now but I will verify tomorrow that
the patcher is dropping the files into the same folder as all the others.

Interestingly, C:\Program Files\Sony\Everquest has never contained the
EQLS_window_pieces_02.tga file. Folks have advised me ot search for it an
delete it because it may be corrupt and that's why the patcher may be having
problems, but it was never installed in the first place. For whatever
reason, the patcher just chokes on EQLS_window_pieces_02.tga.
