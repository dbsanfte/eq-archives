Hmm... this may not be related, but it feels like it might be, to me... I
drove a truck for a living for 7 years, and even though I HAD a map, I still
needed to know (and understand) what direction I was heading in and how to
"get there and back again". Even before that, I had to know about direction,
because that's part of what geologists do, among other things. Even before
that, I never did understand why people got lost/couldn't find their way to
where they were going/didn't know where the zone was... Not slamming anyone,
just cannot figure out the bad travel thing.
