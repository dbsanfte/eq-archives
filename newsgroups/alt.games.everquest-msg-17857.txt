Anyone who uses a solitary common word as their password is 1) an
idiot (generally); and 2) not following instructions(specifically).

User stupidity is not Verant's problem.  It's the user's.

Ummm......it doesn;t matter if you have 1 box, 50 boxes or 1000 boxes.
You can still only process fewer than  16 million attempts per day.
That bottleneck is on VERANT's side of the https connection.  And you
are also flooding the login server in a way sure to draw attention.

And even uassuming an "idiot user" scenario, If a "Cracked" account
user contacts Verant, a simple check of the Station.Sony  logs should
turn up of hundreds of bad password errors if the account was cracked
via a burte force approach.  The lack of such is an indication the
victim's crack was accomplished via  "social engineering".  

>Your math is only valid when you assume that everyone's password looks like 
>a PGP key.

Hmmm......ok.  Lets assume all passwords consist of something less
complicated than a pgp key, but a _little_ more complicated than a
single common word. Assume each password is structured as a sequence
of 2 common four letter words, with a 4 digit number appended.  That
should be easier to remember than a phone number.   There are roughly
1000 common four letter words, and 10000 4 gigit combos.  So the
number of possible combinations is 1000*1000*10000 = 10 billion.  It
would still take ~600 days of bombarding the Station's login server to
exhaust all possible combinations for ONE Station.Sony account.  And
that's before you account for the fact that the numeric digits might
be inserted before, after, or inbetween the words.  OR for intentional
mispellings, or for people who use a common three letter word + a
common five letter word....etc..

Its certainly not impossible to hack accounts if you have a list of
300 station names.  At least one person on the list is certain to have
used their username,  or "mypassword","eqpassword", "shit", "fuck" or
some other common password. But why should Verant be held responsible
for that kind of stupidity when they specifically warn against it?

Do you actually play EQ?  :)

But seriously, why would they bother to do this for a login process on
a site that attracts at most a few million unique visitors a day?  And
if they ARE devoting this sort of resources to their login server,
don;t you think the staff will notice millions of hits, generating bad
password errors, all originating from the same 50-100 IP addresses?
And if they notice, the targeted user will not have a problem.
