I did this quest for about 10 minutes last Friday and then had to head to 
the Fear raid.  Thanks for posting that page - now I at least I know how 
long it will take to raise it - if it was going to take 1000 hand-ins of 
5gp, I wasn't going to do it, even if it meant no epic.  I won't do a 
timesink like that.  I had a lot of Booze for the raid, at least.

Damn, good point.  I didn't think of that.  Thanks.
