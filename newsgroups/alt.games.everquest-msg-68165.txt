  I guess it depends on your budget.  It's $225 shipped for the four
modules you'd need to play Luclin under Windows XP in Luclin zones
with high quality textures, all the new character models and all the
animations without having to dip in to virtual memory during gameplay.
$225 isn't exactly chump change for some of us.  You could probably be
fine with 768 mb with most of the stuff turned on, but a gigabyte
would be ideal.

  And a month ago, it would've been $38 for the same stick of memory.
That's a little easier to swallow.  Hopefully after Christmas prices
will drop back down to those levels.
