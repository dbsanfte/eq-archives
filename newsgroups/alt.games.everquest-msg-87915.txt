But we can look it up in all sorts of dictionaries, and find different
definitions.  OED is not God.  English language, like any language evolves
over time.  I will grant you that OED has the definition you are using.  So
what?  Number one, I am in America, not England, so even assuming that in
English it does mean only what OED says it means, over here in the states,
where we don't speak quite the same dialect of English, it has come to mean
abstaining from sexual relations.  It does not matter what it originally
meant at one time, today, in modern society, here in the US, it means
abstaining from sexual relations.  The reason it means that is because that
is what most people accept it to mean.

As to looking up it's meaning, not everyone has access to the OED.  Some of
us have to make do with other dictionaries.  Regardless of that, the way a
language evolves over time is that people use a word to mean something
different from what it used to mean, or a word is imported from another
language, or simply made up.  Over time, the new usage becomes standard, and
the word now has a new meaning.  OED tends to be just a touch behind the
times in that regard, in it's attempt to preserve the English language I
suppose.  You knew exactly what she meant when she used the word celibacy,
everyone else here knew exactly what she meant.  Sounds to me like
communication in a common language was occurring, and everyone, well, except
for you, accepted it to mean what she meant when she used the word.

Go ahead and argue til you are blue in the face, the language evolves over
time, that word has fallen victim to this evolution.
