I fully agree. If I need a buff, with the possible exception of CRs,
in which case I'm usually pp-less but make sure to thank the person
excessively, I will ALWAYS offer a donation - and not some "here's a
146gp so-I-don't-have-to-carry-it-around donation either. It's
automatically 1pp or 2pp for *anything*, more from my wealthier
characters. If, *for any reason* that person can't/doesn't want to
buff me, I thank them anyway and move on. After all, they are not my
personal buff machines.

You touched on another pet peeve of mine, newbs who intentionally go
where no newb should ever go. Put a little effort into planning when
it comes to tackling that yellow mob or running through the zone full
of reds. Don't feel you have a right to any buffs you need to help you
get through or even to get your corpse if all goes sour. If you're
lucky, someone will help you out. If you're rude, then rest assured,
I, for one, *never* will.
