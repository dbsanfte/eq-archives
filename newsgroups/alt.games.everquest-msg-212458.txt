Halls of Testing in ToV is where the armor drops are for the Skyshrine 
quest armor.  And, yes, you do sacrifice other stats for resists when you 
go to HoT, unless you have some seriously nice resists on you regular 
gear.

No, he means getting the Thurgadin quest armor by killing the various 
giants hanging out around the arena.  Plate Cycle is in a different spot 
in Kael, and tends to drop a fair amount of plate armor compared to the 
arena.  Vindi would own you.  HoT mobs are easier than Vindi by quite a 
bit really.

It is possible to spawn a dragon.  Don't know much about him.
