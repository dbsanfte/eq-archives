*thinks*  Trying to remember what dropped Adamantite Armor.  Wasn't

Sure, I'll  offer mine...  Druids are great.  Trouble is, that means
there's lots of 'em.  I consider them Generalists.  I've played one
for quite a while; now I'm going to pick a niche, with my SK.  I enjoy
both.

Glad to hear you're enjoying EQ, Barry.  :)  Good luck with your
Druid.
