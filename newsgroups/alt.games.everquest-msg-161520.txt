The obviously conservative justices are:

Chief Justice William Rehnquist
Justice Anthony Kennedy
Justice Antonin Scalia
Justice Clarence Thomas

You say Justice Sandra Day O'Connor isn't conservative, but it's
just not true.  She sometimes chooses a liberal position, but it's
rare.  She is an admitted conserative.

A quick search through Google easily reveals her position in most
cases, and they're mostly conservative.

Of the remaining four justices, I'll let you do the homework and
figure out which two often take a surprising conservative stance.
They may be considered liberals, but cross the aisle on a semi-
regular basis.

I stand by my statement that our supreme court is dominated by
conservatives.
