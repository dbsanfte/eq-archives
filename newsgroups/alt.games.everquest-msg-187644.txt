ACTUALLY:  WinXP Pro and WinXP Home are very similar in their roots, with
both being based on NT.  Both are complete 32 bit operating systems.  All
applications are now run in separate address spaces, like NT.  All 16 bit
code is run using an "emulator".  I'm a little fuzzy on this part because I
haven't read about it in over a year.  Home is merely more tailored for home
use, while there are more tools on Pro for business use, especially in the
organizational security area.  There should be no difference in performance
between the two systems for gaming.  As for Win2K, it was the last of the
"old interface" NT systems.
