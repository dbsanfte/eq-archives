Two things:

1. MW4 has only a superficial resemblance to the lieterary battletech
universe. The makers weren't much about maintaining canon. In a purist
sense, it was very disappointing that way.

2. Stackpole writes the books that move the storyline. The other
authors add to it, but he's the one in charge of the main thread. You
want to get the Warrior trilogy first, the Blood of Kerensky trilogy
second. That will give the proper introdution to who the houses are,
and then who the clans are. After that, knock yourself out, just pay
attention to the dates the story happens in. Stuff around 3020 is old
school Battletech. The clans arrive in 3050.
