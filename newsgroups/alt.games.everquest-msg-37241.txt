Every 12 game hours, give or take (kill the PH at 6 PM, see Pyzjn
sometime before 6 AM, allowing for the occasional failure to spawn /
Varsoon / misc. wackiness.

Well, total time spent to get one (the only one, so far) was roughly
18 hours of play, spread over several days when I could get the camp.
That said, I yielded the camp to a necro so I could go sell the thing,
gave him the "how to" tips and stayed in touch with him on and off all
day - he spent about 12 hours, so far, today, camping Pyzjn and never
saw her once (either he's still doing something wrong or I broke her).
Don't know whether he succeeded, since The Rathe is down *again*.

A little too late, I sold it within minutes of zoning into East
Spammons (7K PP on The Rathe, if anyone's curious).
