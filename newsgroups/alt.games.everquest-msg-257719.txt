Sh'yeah, right, as if that'll stop PL'ing.  It'll depend on just
how they're implementing this feature, but I'm sure there'll be
ways to PL.  E.g., PL'er whacks mob until it's nearly dead, then
calls for help, and PL'ee steps up and finishes it off.  Not to
mention PL'ing via high-level buffs, healing, crowd control, etc.

Those who want to be PL'ed will find a way.
