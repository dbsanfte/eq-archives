1.  Why did you drag up such an ancient post?
2.  Isn't it obvious that Lance's subject was tongue in cheek?

My pet damage is calculated in with my DPS so basically the melee lines are
all pet dmg because i did not enter melee combat during the entire time.

All Durations: 43:57 

DPS 
Jaytee 167 (including pet) 
Mephit Lackey (DC PET) 137 
Ganeby 65 Time equipped warrior with Vaznir 137 
Kanlarzz 65 Time equipped monk 156 

Link to my Log file if anyone would review the results cause its after
