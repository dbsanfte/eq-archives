    We don't AE in the classical sense. Every mob gets an offtank, and once
aggro is properly established people with AoE nukes will cast from time to
time. But as Ben said, they aren't stunnable so we don't gather them in a
heap and let fly.

    You've heard about our one experience with the AoW getting ninja-looted.
We've also had some train issues, the worst being once after a wipeout. Just
as the lucky cleric (me) was logging back in after camping, a monk (not one
of ours) brought AoW and a few friends and feigned almost right beside me.
We were lucky some of the other camped clerics were slow coming in, but we
didn't get a second shot that day.

    And there's a bunch of different earrings, so every loot whore goes
hoping "their" earring will drop!

> 10 WIS on a wizard earring?

    The earring is all/all. Only two WIS casters there didn't have WIS at
230 or higher (so at 255 with KEI), and one was the second box of the
guildleader so she didn't ask for it. The wizards, however, would LOVE a 100
MANA earring for when they Manaburn, so it went to one of them. For
reference, I was the other WIS caster under 230 (226) and no way I'm putting
on some POS earring with no HPs on it. ;-)

    Otherwise known as mud bowl, or silver temple? Straight from the
courtyard, through the double doors to the right of the door that leads to
AoW Bubble and Tae Temple (the place with the gorillas)? Yes, we've been
there as a guild. It has a reputation as being very tough now. We had three
groups, so it wasn't tough - but at one point we had a non-stop fight for
maybe 15-20 minutes, with the adds. So no picnic.

    I'd agree.

> Im just wondering what nice is hidden away in there

    On our trip there we found some low AC 65 HP pants, and the droolerrific
Lizard Blood earring (the 70 HP one). Pants came off a named in the open
room before you actually get to the mud bowl area, and the earring came off
a named that spawns in the middle of the three spawns on top of the pyramid,
on the side facing you as you enter the mud bowl area.

    And the XP is great, isn't it? Wish I was allowed to XP there, sigh...
At least last night we were allowed to do Callers in FG so we could stock up
on Glands for Emperor today.
