	Mr. Harmon, you are full of shit.

	The last time I drew agro I didn't want was several weeks ago in Temple of
Veeshan (HoT), because at 56 my Jolts don't stick to the Wurms often enough.
(Jolting Blades was a big help, though.)  In the general case, if I don't want
a mob on me, it's not.

	And I'm using an Earthcaller.

	During my 5 month vigil in Hate for the Shattered Emerald of Corruption, I
can't tell you how many times in wipeouts I was one of the last ones standing,
swinging all the time.  My weapons during this period were a Revultant Whip to
start with, then a Spined Dragon Claws.  I wasn't using a Wurmslayer.  Any
Ranger who cares to avoid agro can just use a Wurmslayer up to about level 58
and maintain an acceptable damage output.  I don't advocate this because any
Ranger who uses a Wurmslayer exclusively up to 58 will be ill-suited to deal
with a higher agro profile.

	Rangers are called "mana sinks" because of game dynamics that changed well
over a year ago.  Pinheads like you continue to spread misinformation,
oblivious to the fact that Rangers now have better tools to manage their agro,
better equipment and better defensive skills.  Our only real shortcoming these
days is HP; we have lower HP than just about any of the fighter classes.  (I
am pretty sure Rogues and Monks outpoint us; not sure about Bards.)

	We may not be "essential" the way Warriors and Clerics are, but there is
no class in this game that can do what a well-played Ranger can do.

|A druid who cannot manage his aggro is about the worst cleric mana sink there
|is.

	Davian and I are in the same guild, and thanks to a now-departed member,
can personally attest to this....
