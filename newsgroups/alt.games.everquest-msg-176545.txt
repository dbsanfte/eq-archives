EQ is about the journey, not the destination. Have you had fun over
the last 3 years? Do you still feel that EQ is worth 12.95 a month? If
so, then continue the journey. There is no prize for hitting level 65.
and no penalty for never getting past level 10. How much you enjoy EQ
is entirely up to you.

>EQ?

The game had "meaning", because the DM set "goals". You have to be
your own DM in EQ. Set a goal to master a trade-skill, kill a specific
mob (ie Vox, Emperor Crush, Innoruuk, etc, etc), become "friendly"
with the residents of a city that is currently KoS to you, etc, etc,
etc. About the best goal you could set for yourself is to find a
regular hunting party with people that share a similar play style to
yourself. Of course these goals all require effort. There is no DM to
hold your hand and lead you in the right direction.

>quit.I'm just venting .

It is only "tiresome" if you allow EQ to become work. Re-assess your
goals. I once spent 32 hours (in 2 long sessions) camping Raster for
my retired Monk. Afterwords I realized (I'm slow at times hehe) the
truth about EQ (or rather "my truth")......EQ plays the same at level
1 as it does at level 65. (Kill/Loot/Sell/Level) In my mad rush to
level and get my epic, I had turned EQ into a job/mission, instead of
a fun and entertaining game. I missed the "best years" of my monks
life madly chasing the "carrot" I had placed before myself. The goals
I had set for myself guaranteed that I would not have "fun" playing,
because I am really happiest as a low-mid level player.

It can be, but you have to put in the "effort" (not work). I suggest
you roll-up a character on the FV server, and get into the RP
community over there. I think you will find that the atmosphere is
much closer to the D&D world you are looking for.
