The most annoying thing I see are bards running the whole hill DoT'ing
everything. You just don't get the chance to pull with those guys around and
they seem obvious to anyone else trying to fight there. Sure, they can
manage X number of giants, but it's a horribly selfish thing to do and by
the time they've kill the mini train chasing them another two players could
have killed a few and be almost ready for the next spawn.

Sorry, makes me mad :)
