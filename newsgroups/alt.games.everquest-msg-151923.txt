Karnors has plenty of things that are blue at level 60.  I went there last
night to check out finishing the Concussion quest for my Wizard, and some
nice people camping the hand room and pulling from the lower jail came and
escorted me from the zone, helped me to the quest mob--just in time to see
someone else kill it, and then let me wait with them for it to respawn.

They were two level 60's and a level 58, and they were getting XP.  I
sponged a blue bubble off them (I'm level 55) while I sat there waiting for
the quest mob to respond (I offered to disband from the group, but they said
it was OK) (They told me NOT to help on any fights, because of OT faction).

The hand room was interesting.  Everything I saw spawn there was
apprehensive to me, so I just made sure to stay away from their pulls, and
everything was fine.

Most things that were obivously undead hated me (except the undead jailor
was apprehensive), and most of the rest did not hate me.  However, the
Drolvarg Sentries were annoying: some were apprehensive, and some were
scowling.  Before bringing my Wizard in, I brought my 10 Rogue in to scout
out the place, and both times, it was sentries that got him, even though
most of the ones he conned were indifferent--he never managed to see the
scowling ones coming.
