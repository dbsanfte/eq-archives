** Stability Issues **

The team here at the EQ Lab has isolated a memory leak which was causing
server instability after 10 to 12 hours of uptime (which we are sure you
have noticed) We hope to have this issue resolved during tonight's update.
We would like to thank you all for your patience and understanding during
these last few trying days and wish you the best of luck this holiday
season.

Thanks for your time and thank you for being a part of Norrath.
