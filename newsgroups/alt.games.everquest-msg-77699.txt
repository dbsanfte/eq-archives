It can depend on where you are.  Before I put in UseUmbra=FALSE,
I used to be semi-laggy in Shadowhaven (although no worse than
I'd expect given my system), but ULTRA laggy (i.e., horribly
slow frame rates) whenever I passed near the "town hall" in
the "Short and Stout Quarter" of SH, especially when I was facing
north.

I had always suspected it was some sort of weird Umbra-related
problem, since that area is actually rather small and enclosed,
and should have been a "best case scenario" for the Umbra
algorithm.

Sure, enough, when I put in UseUmbra=FALSE, that area of
ShadowHaven (which had ALWAYS been framerate molasses for me)
was suddenly smooth as silk.

Yo, Verant, debug Umbra, please.  And while you're at it,
add an in-game command to allow us to turn it on or off
at will, as necessary.
