There is a new quest in Lesser Faydark to get a Faydark Cloak which has one
charge of TP to Faydark.  You get it by giving Bloodboil's drop (is now the
place of the Faerie Princess in the mushroom town) to Talisyn Stormwing by
the drakes near MM entrance.  Bloodboil is around the high 20's, but there
are quite of few sprite guards around so a group of high 20's/low 30's would
probably be needed.  Bloodboil I believe is a random spawn, sometimes
spawning twice in a row, sometimes you have to wait hours - the PH is next
to Gearheart.  The item you have to loot from him is also a rare drop.
