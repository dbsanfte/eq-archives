I suggest selling it for 40k.

Back in the first month or so of PoP on my server, people only got into HoH
about 3 days before the drop rate nerf.  Windblades instantly rose to around
60k from previously being 20k.  However the Girdle was overlooked.  I bought
all 4 in the bazaar at the time (20-25k ea.) and resold 3 of them for 30k
ea.  Those were the only ones I've seen in the bazaar since then, besides
some dumbfuck that had one for 75k about a month ago.
