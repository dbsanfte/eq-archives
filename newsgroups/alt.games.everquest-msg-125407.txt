How long does bind wound take?  The check for medding during mana regen
takes place every six seconds.  As long as you are medding when it checks,
it doesn't matter what you do in between.  E.g., as soon as you see yourself
get a little mana while medding, you can stand up, do something, and sit
back down, and if that takes less than six seconds, you are fine.
