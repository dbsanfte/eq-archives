/em hands Bizbee a wand of irony detection.


Yes, this person was sick and tired of recieving 20 tells a minute
asking for clarity, so they slap on their anonymous tag.  THEN they
die and need a rez.  What do they do?  Send the 20th tell that minute
to the cleric in Fear who prefers to not go /anon or /roleplay.


Golden rule, man.  If you don't want random tells asking for whatever
unique ability your class can do, don't send random tells asking for
the uniquie abilities of other classes.


Me?  I don't mind a few requests for clarity as long as they're
courteous, and preferably from someone standing right next to me.  But
I have a strong dislike for hipocracy.  And I will continue to give
anonymous people a hard time for sending me random tells asking for
buffs.

To belabor the point: I have nothing against people who use /role or
/anon.  I do find people who use /role or /anon, then use "/who all
otherClass" to find out who to ask for buffs|ports|rezzes to be
hipocrites.


Now that you're all aware that there are freaks out there like James
and myself, who don't mind helping people, but are less likely to if
we think you're trying to avoid the same kind of out-of-the-blue
request that you just sent us; why not just turn roleplay off while
you're sending the /tell?  We'll never know the difference! :-)
