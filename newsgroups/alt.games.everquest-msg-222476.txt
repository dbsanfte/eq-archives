To be sure. But most (make that 'almost all') customers don't like being 
spammed on usenet.

Am I to understand that you want very few customers then? That you find 
most people undesirable as customers?

Most businesses I can think of would kill to appeal to the demographic 
that 'doesn't like to be spammed'. You seem to have gone the other 
way... and actively seek to alienate them. Who is your target 
demographic?  The 9 twits who love spam and don't blink when they see 
'fillay minion' at the local (*supposed*) fine-dining restaurant.
