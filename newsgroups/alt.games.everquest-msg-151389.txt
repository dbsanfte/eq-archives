Too late, I think they have reached sentient state so if I tried to starve
them out at this stage I would proberly cop an adverse UN security
resolution and food aid would ensue soon after. Having primordial soup in
the keyboard is one thing, but trying to type with a convoy of genetically
modified grain laden Unimog's under the keys would be hell...

I tend to be ham fisted anyway, so cover or no cover the keyboard's days are
numbered anyhow. They are pretty much disposable objects in my house, I
always keep a spare and they cost less than a carton of beer anyhow.
