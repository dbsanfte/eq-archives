Well, I don't think many US history courses devote much time to the
Wild West.  They tend to concentrate on the Oregon Trail, westward
expension, irrigation projects in the west, etc.  I'm not sure that
being unfamiliar with a television character is always a bad thing.
(Yes, i know that Bat Masterson was a peace officer, saloon keeper,
marshal, and sportswriter.  He was at most a minor celebrity.)

Honestly, I looked at Wun Toque and thought woon tock, though I can
see one toke, if I squint real hard.  (I'm pretty sure that *un is
almost always pronounced oon by Chinese speakers, and that very much
looks like a Chinese name to me.)
Wun Toque ahva rtha lynne suite gezuz!
