A friend of mine was in the same situation.  Not only was she the only
CoS-casting druid...she was the ONLY druid.  After the first attempt failed
she had to go...and that promptly cancelled the raid for everyone.

It's not often a druid can do that!  Happens all the time with my enchanter,
but a druid?

Moral of the story...don't piss off druids & don't call them useless or else
you're calling yourself an idiot.
