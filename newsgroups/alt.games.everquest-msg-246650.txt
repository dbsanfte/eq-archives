don't confuse dx9 hardware and dx9compatible hardware.
I am not even sure everquest software implements any real dx9 hardware
functions.
I am using a geforce2 and ti4200 with directx9b and running everquest
without problems under windows 98 and 56.64 drivers
I am planning on upgrading hardware in the next gen cards when apps actually
make use of the hardware well.
I am not even sure if directx9b is fully finished.

Any way look for a driver cleaner program and remove all old drivers
some info and apps and drivers here http://www.guru3d.com
also I would remove video card clean contacts with white eraser carefully
then reseat card
double check cables and monitor if you can.
Sometimes swapping cables and monitors makes weird problems go poof and
narrow down the real problem

Reinstall directx9b
then reload nvidia drivers
Try 56.64 drivers. If you are using a different version of windows try the
newest drivers for whatever version.
driver 45.23 is probably best speed for ti4200. I used and liked them but am
not sure if they work under current everquest.

Try the freebie fixes first.
Your ti4200 is actually a better performing card than the cheap dx9 ones.
oh and as an aside..when someone tells you buy a product of whatever company
put your fanboi radar on...
