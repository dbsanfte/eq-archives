(snipped press release)

This statement is basically meaningless. What it probably amounts to is 
nothing more than Intel using EQ screenshots in advertisements as a game 
that takes "full advantage" of the P4. In exchange, Sony puts an 
"Optimised for Intel Pentium 4 processors" (or some such nonsense) in 
their EQ ads. 

This sort of thing is nothing new. 3dfx used to do it, and nVidia does it. 
Nothing more than cross promotion, and pretty much meaningless to us.

In any event, it's no reason for AMD processor users to be worried.
