I wouldnt bother slowing and disempowering anything in paladul unless you
just wanna get in the swing of doing it.   just melee stuff like everyone
else is doing.

Also the tash line is a chanter debuff if I recall, shaman version is called
malo and i believe they both stack with each other, they are both
essentially resistance debuffs.

in later levels (group wise) your only job in the group will be to keep
everyone buffed, and malo, slow, and at your discretion, weaken the enemy.
(this all that is expected out of a shaman, altho most have the mana to spot
hot if needed)
