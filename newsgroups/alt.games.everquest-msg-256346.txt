As I said, we are a family guild that was gutted of all the 
higher members and struggling to survive...I have taken to PLing 
our lower members as much as a cleric can, but we simply arent 
even able to scrounge more than 6 or 7 members over 45 on a good 
saturday=\ I am an officer in the guild, FWIW and I am the 
furthest along in the epic process. At least we arent to the raid 
point yet, but we are at least holding our own.
