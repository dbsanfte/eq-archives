You know I just realized I never noticed him leave until now.

Anyways the point I was trying to make was that it was the plat that
was stolen, not the money. Taking the money back was legitimate until
proven to not be so. I fully concede that the plat was stolen, but
since I don't believe it has value to anyone but SOE I don't see it as
fraud, just someone scamming someone who very much deserved it. :-)

Each case on its own merits, Biz. I bet you've sped in your life, that
doesn't mean you condone every crime that's ever been committed.

And it's not a felony yet. :-)

I'm sure I'll survive. What food chain? I'm always the last to
