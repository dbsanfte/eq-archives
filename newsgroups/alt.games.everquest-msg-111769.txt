So, out of curiosity, what'd be considered a sane player-to-player price
for a stack of bone chips?  What do they actually cost from a vendor?

I'd much rather see HL chars buying from newbs than vendors.  Assuming
you're going to have a player economy at all, it's going to be based on
drop items, and there just aren't many even minimally valuable low-level 
ones.
