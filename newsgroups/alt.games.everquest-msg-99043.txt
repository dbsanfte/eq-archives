First of all, a good salesperson doesn't care about the bitching if the person
doesn't back it up.  In other words, if you aren't bringing back the car go
ahead and bitch, my check is the same.  Of course there are repeat customers
but it sounds to me like you all bitch about the programming on the usenet then
tell all your friends how cool the game is.
 
The fact of the matter is, the only thing that will change the patch procedure
is money.  If Verant sees a tremendous amount of accounts being cancelled after
a patch that gets botched, they might just change their procedure.  Of course,
the rest of us who wait 1 extra day to play again will be the ones to see the
change. :)
