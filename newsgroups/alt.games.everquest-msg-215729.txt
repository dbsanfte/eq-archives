Its soooooo painful to have that discussion.  I play different classes
deliberately, to learn about them, its an interesting passtime to me.  But
sometimes I think I'd be happier not knowing how much more effective that shaman
(or cleric or druid or bard or warrior...) could be if only he'd just...

At the kill pace in the LDoN runs I've seen so far, slows are a waste of mana.
Yes, if mobs take real time to kill, slow is a big help, and slow plus canni
plus torpor... well I've seen the math, shamans are actually better healers than
clerics under the right circumstances; because they can sustain healing at a
pace that will cripple a cleric (and nobody even considered a druid).  But if
mobs are falling so quickly that the slow is only saving you a few hits, then
its better to put the mana into heals, since the PC you are healing isn't going
to stop using those HP, but the dead mob, well it doesn't matter how slow he is
if he's dead.

Hard to say, after all, I agreed with him in the end, so by disagreeing with me,
are you on his side, or the enemy of his friend.. his enemy?

But I don't pay any real attention to who I'm agreeing with or disagreeing, I
attack (or defend) arguements on their merits, as much as I'm able.  Just throw
in anti DT jabs for the fun of it.
