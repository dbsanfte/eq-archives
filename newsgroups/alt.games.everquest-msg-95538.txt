Sorry, I guess I was not very clear.  I was spamming a friend in Human and
he was spamming me in Dwarf.  We were both getting skill point notices (mine
in the wrong color) and bam I stop getting skill points.  We would zone I
spam, he spam and spam and... nothing.  We do this like 5 times. Him getting
the skill message and me not.  I check my stats and I have gone from bad to
very bad.  When?
Before or after I stopped getting the skill improvement messages?  Who
knows?  The fact that Verant chooses this particular skill out of all the
skills there are to not display the numerical value in the notification
message, is a real pain.
