I was thinking it started procing at 35 just looked it up and Casterrealm
say it starts at 45. It is a great weapon till it start fireing off the AOE
once it does get rid of it. It will hold agro much better then a wurmy. If
you are not the main tank use the Wurmy or a good 2handed for more damage.
If you are the main Tank use the Skyfire, faster is better then more damage
for agro.
