I would imagine you could talk an enchanter into making your two +3 wis
earrings and two +7 wis rings for roughly 700-800p, cheaper if you can find
one that will have pity on you and do it for cost.  My 50 druid still uses
the +7 wis rings and has replaced the plus 3 earrings with forest loops
3wis/3agi/3dex, but the only time I ever need the dex or agi is when I get
too close or get jumped =)...
