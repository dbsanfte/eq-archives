It would be much better if I received tell asking if I wanted to join and
giving me a quick rundown of the group.  If I am a 7 Cleric, I don't want to
be in a group with only 5th levels that will be pulling green-to-me mobs or
any 12th levels that I won't be getting exp while grouped with them (or my
20th lvl Shaman doesn't want to group with a 35 or a bunch of 15s, etc).
Tell me who is in the group so I can make an informed decision.

Also, what if I am waiting for an invite from a friend and miss the
drive-by?  My friend gets there and invites.  He gets the So-and-so is
considering another group, while I look up and all of a sudden am in someone
else's group.  So it takes an extra 30 seconds.  What is it but a little
time?  Right.  But it is my time that someone else just wasted.  That is
rude.
