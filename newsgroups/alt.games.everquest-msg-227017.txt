Lot of rumors but my guess is the plat dupe bug concerning the shared
bank and /quit. Buzz is that if /q is executed fast enough after doing
a transfer to the shared slot your char is not saved and the plat is
duped. Supposed to be a prog to do this automaticly but not sure. And
they were worried about ShowEQ lol. Heh good job SoE, didnt really
think all that plat was coming from sharks did you?
