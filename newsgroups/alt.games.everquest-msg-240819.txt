Unless you're talking about initial healing from the clerics, I don't
really see how it would be a problem. To a large extent it tends to be
self-correcting, that lower lvl guild isn't going to have the weapons
for the DPS melees to generate insane agro and won't have the flowing
thought/focus items for the nukers to do the same. Any warrior has had
snap agro (vs raid level mobs) since they got AoE taunt  and nowadays
they have their agro 'spells' and LDoN augments to help out. 

Resists, healing power and DPS tend to scale up together for any guild
from what I've seen. ... which admittedly isn't much lately, it's been
a while since I did any raiding. 

Pickup raids have proved that you can get to elementals w/o uber gear,
it should be a lot easier for a guild that's used to working together.
