   Lenny and I were hunting in SRo last night, concentration on the undead since I
love playing wizard to them with my special cleric spells.  One of the mummies we
dropped (or was it a ghoul?  Whatever.) was carrying a parrying dagger, the first I
had ever seen.  Lenny and I got into a brief argument when he looted it (Honey,
here's a dagger you can use." "I'm a CLERIC, remember, HONEY *heavy sarcasm* in my
voice" "Well, it just looks like a dagger.  It's really a crappy shield." "GIMMEE! 
GIMMEE NOW!  GIMMEE GIMMEE!"
   See, alot of people seem to think that healers in EQ work on the same principle as
the soul-binders.  Instead of just saying "Bind my soul", one says "Heal please?",
without any thought of the fact that mana isn't free in terms of our time spent, or
that we might not feel like powerleveling every swinging Richard that prances up and
places the demand.  My shaman Tealeef has run into this several times, and now  poor
Teapray is also.   
   It was no problem for Tealeef.  A simple "No."  was fine.  But I was wondering how
to handle it on FV.  I do try to roleplay there, and as a cleric, should I not indeed
heal on demand?  But then, it simple goes against my nature to be taken for granted
as some sort of convenient NPC that casts heal upon demand upon strangers.  Now, I
can just equip the dagger as well as my hammer, and inform them that I'm sorry, but
in general the Duel Wielding classes are very poor healers.  And it is true, too.  Of
course, no high elf can ever be a duel wielder, but I figure that most of the players
that are savvy enough to know that will also have better manners (I know, optimistic
as always).  And it fits my roleplaying of a mischievous, rebellious sort.  After
all, I took up with an ogre, no?
