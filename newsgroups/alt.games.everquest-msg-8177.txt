I have an ATI Radeon 64 DDR and I'm getting the same thing... except also
when I zone, the "gray area" of my screen disappears and I'm only left with
the view (3D) part and a small square that moves with my cursor, and my
class symbol (lute).  I just open my inventory and flip back and it's fine
until I zone again.

I have Velious on order... I will let you know if that improves it or not.
If you hear of another solution let me know ;)
