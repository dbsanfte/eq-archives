[snip bizbee moment in original reply]

Prices go up. Wages go up. Staffing levels go up. The number of teams
they have working on different things have gone up.

Its called inflation; and no, more customers does not mean more revenue
with no increase in costs.

Prices go up. Live iwth it. This is why you get a raise periodically, and
if you dont why you have to leave your job and find a new one.

Sigh.
