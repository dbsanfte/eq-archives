Yeah, that's why my pocket cleric, who has never walked into that room,
always got tossed down the hall while I was busy fighting.  =)  The spiders
blowing up doesn't extend out into the hall, but the Behemoth's AEs
definitely do.  Oh how, at the time, we wished they wouldn't cause that
would have made the fight a lot easier if we could just stick the healers on
the other side of a wall.

For my guild, this fight was twice as hard as RZ for becoming elemental.
