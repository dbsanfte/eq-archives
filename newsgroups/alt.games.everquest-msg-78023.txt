It's all about using the walls.  If your character is in a place where the
camera would go through a wall, then it moves closer.  Using this, you can
get closer than you want.  Just experiment with it a little and you'll
figure it out.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
