Also keep in mind that you would also be aggrod for pulling a corpse
of someone with bad faction.  I learned this after I got stranded in
PoG (I accidentally ported there - please don't ask), and a Wizzy from
my guild came in to pick me up, and promptly got slaughtered by that
energy being at the landing pad.  I went to drag his corpse to a safe
spot, at which point said energy being proceeded to attack ME, after
leaving me alone for two hours.  Touchy touchy....
