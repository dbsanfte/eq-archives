That means he is out of touch with your perspective, not necessarily
that "vision" thing.  In fact the comments quoted sound a lot like the
old Brad before all this exploded into what it is today, back when he
used to have visions.  Sony's vision might agree with you completely and
also add in an online store where you can bill FBSSs and the latest uber
gear directly to your account, but Brad used to talk about a RP game. 
If your goal is to attract the most customers and make the most money
from them you may well be right, but if your goal is to build a great RP
game then you have to be ready to sacrifice a few numbers from your
expectations.  All the talk about a "vision" seemed to have more to do
with the game itself than the bottom line.

Maybe you have been twinking too long and don't realize it, but you
really can lvl a brand new char to 10 in just a few short hours of play
in many newbie areas if you have played the game before.  I recently
started two new chars, one is obscenely twinked by my standards in order
to keep pace with what my friends dropped on their chars, the other
completely untwinked.  The untwinked one is one lvl less and has about
half the time /played.  I also found that the joy of a piece of netted
found on a froggy is about the same as finding a Seb tunic on a bigger
froggy if you can really use a piece of netted at the time <G>.  Joy is
what it should be about, that's why its called gaming.

And someday, someone will be smart enough to realize that that is a good
thing.  Don't try to cater to the lowest common denominator in order to
have the highest subscriber base.  Be honest up front that your game is
harsh compared to games that allow such absurd changes to game play and
the customers you do have will stay with you because of a true sense of
accomplishment rather than constantly be waiting for something better to
come along.
