Thanks - hadn't found that one.

It's similar to mine in that it's '...said that' rather than a press
release or even a direct quote, but this does lean towards horses being
slower than I first thought. 

Two parts confuse me though:

(1) ...go any faster than skilled players can travel...

As a L60 warrior who likes to think himself 'skilled', does this mean
that the fastest horse will hold no speed increases for me, and that the
slower, cheaper versions would actually slow me down? Giving the benefit
of the doubt in assuming 'skilled' means 'with the right friends' this
could mean anything from L9 SoW, L60 SoW, Selos, or L60 bard doing
Selo's with epic and enhancement disc running. The most likely event,
assuming this is approx verbatum is: fastest horse = mid 50s SoW

(2) ...because horses won't go any faster than skilled players can
travel, players on foot won't be disadvantaged because all of a sudden
monsters can run faster to make up for horseback riding...

So, which 'because' is the reason they won't be disadvantaged?
a:  not disadvantaged because they can get a L60 SoW or Selos to stay 1
step ahead of the speeded up mobs.
b:  not disadvantaged because the mobs aren't speeded up#
c:  a combination of both
