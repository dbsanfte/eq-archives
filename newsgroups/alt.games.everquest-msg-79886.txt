    Mezzing usually doesn't drive enchanters OOM, unless you're surrounded
by The Hordes or the enchanter is forced to use the really high-cost mezzes
like GoK. Hasting drives enchanters OOM (and slowing if they have that job
as well). Once an enchanter gets their snake staff it's quite amazing how
much mana they have. Recent mana check when doing a Caller quest in Fungus
Grove (give Caller booze, they start summoning mobs in a steady stream, wave
after wave, until the Caller is killed or you give him back a quest item to
stop it): CLR, 20% / SHM, 40% (constant wincing) / ENCH 90%. This is with
the ENCH doing non-stop mezzing, pretty much. At that point we told him to
load his nuke.
