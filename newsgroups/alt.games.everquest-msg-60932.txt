Does anybody know what zone this person is talking about or where they are
talking about?

This method is a camp that is quite lucrative.  The loot is exceptional,
considering that some characters can begin soloing some of the suggested
mobs at level 25.  This method actually involves camping one or more mobs
that are in the zone, and you will be able to camp more of them as your
levels progress.  Therefore, this method becomes more powerful and worth
more platinum as you progress.  As an example, Padrino was soloing two of
the recommended mobs at level 25-30.  At level 35 it was 3.  At level 45 he
was killing all the recommended mobs as they spawned, and a lot of other
good mobs in the area in between! Loot ranges in value from 50 plat to 1500
per drop.
