If you're thinking of Oppenheimer's words at the sight of the atom bomb, it
was:
"... I am become Shiva, Destroyer of Worlds", which is a quote out of the
Bhagavad Gita.

Direct translation of the passage into English is:
"If the radiance of a thousand suns
Were to burst at once into the sky
That would be like the splendor of the Mighty one ...
I am become Death,
The shatterer of Worlds."
