Love Eq so far, although there should be more to do solo. Anyway been
playing afor a few month and i just have one think that is a mojor turn off
in my opinion....

Who the heck programmed the Mobs collision detection engine???? Darn thing
walk, fly, crawl hop their way into obstacles, through obstacles and don't
even have the decency to die outside objects when killed....

I mean, one would expect to be somewhat safe *behind* a wall? or on top of a
tree? Heck, if I can't hit the mob (unless using a range attack); why should
it be able to hit back if not using a range attack?

Nothing more disconcerting that to chase a Mob and watch it diseappear in a
*put your prefered obstacle here* and hoping that he will at least make it
through efore dying so you can loot the darn thing.

grrrrr....

Rokanything...
