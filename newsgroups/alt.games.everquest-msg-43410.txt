Yeah! And you had to buy things from vendors one at a time, instead of
the oh-so-easy shift-click to buy 20. And root used to not stack with snare,
and root canceled SoW! Then there were the real hybrid exp penalties, back
in my day being a level 50 Troll Shadow Knight meant something! And nothing
used to ever run when it was hurt, everything stayed until the bitter end pummeling
you the whole time. And don't even get me started on how easy the user interface
is to use now, sheesh! Right-click to re-equip after death, tsk tsk.

Yep these youngsters got it easy now. =)

:fumbles for his gnomitol and adjusts his everdepends.
