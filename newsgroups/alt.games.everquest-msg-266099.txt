You've never seen the previous preorder items, have you?

Lessee, a stick that eventually gives a small faction mod with folks
in GoD.  A bag which, if you do enough quests, eventually gains some
weight reduction.

The new ones are a pet dragon, which can only be seen inside your
house and takes up room that might be used for storing tradeskill
stuff and is therefore just a *little* bit lower than useless, and a
set of boots which have already been stated are going to be inferior
to J-Boots.

Please, by all means, go with WoW.  The boots are so obviously
overpowering that you cannot possibly compete against someone who has
them.
