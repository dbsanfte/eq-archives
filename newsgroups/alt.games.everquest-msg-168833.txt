Thats very educational.

In a group, shamans are king, with haste, slow, heals and Torpor, along with that mana regen capability you complain
about.

On a raid, they seem to Malo, Slow, and then (if not dead) you don't hear much from them until next mob.  Often they are
busy recovering from rez, though.

Solo.. welll I don't group with solo shaman so what do I know.  They sure were powerful up thru POP release.

What to do with all that mana during raids?  How about heal?  Shaman is a healer class according to the label.  Spot heals
save lives, Torpor saves mana.  I know your heals (other than torpor) aren't all that mana efficient, but your class is
much more mana capable than clerics or druids, so the real question is, how is your hp per minute output?  I'm thinking it
doesn't suck all that much after all.
