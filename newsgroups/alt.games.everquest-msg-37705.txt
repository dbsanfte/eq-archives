Seems like there could be an alternative Warrens & Stonebrunt. If
you're X level, you zone into the alpha version.  You loot & get EXP
in the alpha version with the trivial loot code.  If you're Y level,
you enter the beta version & be able farm from items from the green
mobs.  Then compare the zone use. Are newbies getting exp and the +3
Wis item from the Warrens?   How many newbies use the alpha zone
compared to farmers in the beta zone?  The comparison of zone use
would be most interesting since there's the other issue of
underutilized zones. 
Even if someone never left the Warrens but perma-camped an item,
they'd not get the levels to make combat rediculously easy.  It'd be
easier to farm the beta version, especially since the loot rules
wouldn't be in the beta version.
