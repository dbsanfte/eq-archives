I've gone through two horses in my career so far. I sold the first one 
because the inertia made it useless for soloing. Then someone told me 
about the exploit involving the old-world graphics, and I bought a 
second horse, and all was good, until that got fixed, so I sold it too... 
When you have a hasted PoP ex-pet very angry at you, you need to be able 
to haul ass *right now*.

Now, after the grouping changes, I find myself in a healer role most of 
the time (well,  not most of the time, in fact, only when I'm lucky), so 
I really need a horse again. Problem is, I'm poor as the proverbial 
churchmouse, so... Where would be the fastest place to accumulate horse-
worthy platinum, solo? I've heard Kael, but those giants take a long 
time to kill, and I've *never* so far seen a quest armor piece drop. 
Also, unless I skive off work, I never find RM empty enough to make 
farming HGs worthwhile. What else is there? Sebilis, perhaps? Somewhere 
else I don't know of?

All advice appreciated.
