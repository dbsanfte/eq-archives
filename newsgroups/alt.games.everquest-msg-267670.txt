Well i've been happily running around refugee island for several
hours. Anyway i've got to the end guy in the cave and we got a 4
person group going. Only problem is I have no group window. The server
was going down in ten minutes so before I could say so they all rushed
in.

Now being the healer and having no group window is not a good thing.
One guy died who I could have easily healed. Also once inside the cave
my video lag went through the roof and I was hardly even able to
target anyone or even follow the combat. Gunna have to crank it right
down cause i've had it cranked right up to just acceptable, but
obviously that's not gunna cut it in the big fights.

Anyway back to the group window.... how the hell do you get it up ?

I checked the setup and seen a alt-g for group window but pressing
this done nothing. Server went down before I could really look into it
though.

And where is the spells memorized tab ? All I got is a hotbutton bar
at the bottom with the spells in it.

I wish there was a "setup like EQ1" selection so I knew what the hell
I was doing.

Cheers,
