Heroes Unlimited on Povar.  Pretty decent bunch of guys (and gals!).
We just raided the Hole twice last week for another guildies' epic.
Got to the Kirn guy with no major problems (other than Invis vs.
Undead dropping in that room with 6 renevants.)

We did Chardok too, with relatively little problems at all.  My first
time there, actually.  Just got high enough to raid... lvl 48 now (I
know, I'm starting early on epic!).    Chardok was fun though... that
first time jumping off the bridge is a rush!

It was easy for us, but then again, we had a massive number of people
there.  I got maybe 6 or 7 hits on them before they fell.  Guild is
too fast!!  ;)

>Naggy can really only be done by 52 and below. 

I had heard that before.  Do lvls higher than that get ported out or
something?  If that's the case, we'd need a ton of lvl 52s or lower.
A lot of the guild is above 52.  (One of the good things about the
guild... lots of people all at different levels...  Not a "you must
play 8 hours a day guild," but still capable of decent-sized raids
when planned in advance.)

>Rage is probably even easier. 

Any level requirements on him?

>You can forget Nortlav. He's a

Good thing we didn't go after him after Kirn... half the guild left
the raid... we'd have been toast.

>do with the rest later. 

True... one step at a time, I s'pose!

Thanks for the help!!
