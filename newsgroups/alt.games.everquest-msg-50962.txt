Yes, spot on.

I disagree.

I would say that the majority of the newsgroup are, for lack of being able
to come up with a more appropriate word, more 'conservative' than most
people that actually play the game. By that, I mean that the people in the
newsgroup have definite views on how they think the game should be, how
players ought to behave, and how the game should progress. Most people I
have met in the game, don't take it so seriously.

This seems to be fairly obvious when you think about the average age in this
newsgroup, and the average age in the EQ playerbase. Newsgroups tend to
attract a certain kind of people, so it doesn't seem to me to be a big
surprise that there is a general agreement on the larger issues. There are
disagreements, of course, but these are usually of degree, rather than
angle.
