Really???
Have you been PL'd or are you twinked up??

I have a 44 Ogre zerker and his offense AND defense is over 200...
respectively 210 and 209. 
I have to say though that he is slightly twinked and never been PL'd
<well slightly PL'd>, grouping with a guy my level that had a high
level druid on a 2nd account healing and buffing us :)
I don't normally MT either.
