First off. We're talking -unique- access to content. Only one guild per 
server --ever- at that point. 

However we're discussing a general trend of all high level guilds to 
hoard information, not just the -very top-. Moreover these top guilds do 
not even readily share information accross servers, where there is no 
chance of competition.

That sounds perfectly reasonable to me. I would contend that very few 
heart surgeons have advanced the field of medical science much, vis a 
vis the progress made by non-heart-surgeons performing reasearch into 
cardiac arrest on animals in labs, and other academic pursuits miles 
away from humans in the O.R.

In other words, I think a psychologist, sociologist, mathematician (game 
theory), and members from half a dozen other fields, including say 
economics, would have valuable contributions to this discussion, despite 
not being in a raid guild in EQ.

Given that there aren't any examples of guilds working closely together 
at that level. By your logic, -nobody- is qualified  to assess whether 
or not it would work well with any sort of authority.

Further, if the guilds are cooperating to get into a zone, it stands to 
reason that they'll be able to cooperate with respect to rotating spawns 
etc.

So the game is apparently desperately short of challenges then =)

To motivate SOE to make more truly challenging things, and less annoying 
ones.

That's not remotely the 'advance notice' I was talking about.

We clearly disagree on the finer points of what is fun then ;)
For example, I would call that 'stupid', not 'fun'.

A star wars FPS i recently played had a gun the opponents (in single 
player campaign mode) used that could kill you from full health in one 
hit from about a 100 miles away. (they were maybe 2-4 pixels high, in a 
room 88 degrees off 'forward' 400' above and behind you, behind a 
window), and they could only see your leg from the knee down. (So you 
couldn't see them at all, no how, until you'd moved farther ahead.

If you stepped onto the ramp and stopped to look around (take stock of 
your surrounds, look for non-obvious paths, check for enemies) you died 
and were shunted back to you last save.

Lesson learned: Don't stop on that ramp.

Alternative ways to learn lesson: None. (There were no 'camera's you 
could look through that would hint at what was ahead, no audio cues, no 
fresh corpse on the ramp, nothing.

Good game/level design?  No.

Solving EQ encounters is similiar to playing that FPS.

Given that no guild has just walked its way to the end of GoD, over 
coming obstacles on the fly, without wiping, are we to infer that there 
are only 'not-as-good' guilds then? =)
