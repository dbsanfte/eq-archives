The gypsies in SRo sell to my Iksar SK but they are DE and The Ogres in
Rathe mountains would also sell to him. The gypsies in Oasis may sell to him
but if not you can probably get someone to buy them for you. One of the SK
high level spells could only be bought in Grobb or Ogguk and I had a nice
low level Shammie buy it for me and gave him extra pp for their time.
