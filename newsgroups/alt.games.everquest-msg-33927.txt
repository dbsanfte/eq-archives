Although I didn't comment on the original thread (but you can
probably guess from my prior posts that I wouldn't have petitioned
the name you did), I wouldn't have hesitated a moment to petition
the idiot who tried to impersonate a GM.  Give 'em hell.

Oh, and also note that while he tried to imply he was a new
EQ user, he sure knew how to sound like a GM/Guide responding
to a petition ("greetings, GM so-and-so- here..."), and knew
about the "warnings on accounts" system, etc.

It sounds as if he's been around the game a while.

Maybe he was panicking not because he was going to lose his
Iksar newbie, but because his three 50+ characters on the same
account were about to be hosed.
