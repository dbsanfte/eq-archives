Let me get this straight: you're saying that content that was original
designed for full parties should only be soloed?  What if you're a
relatively new player?  (which I suspect Chorkie is).  I certainly
played LDoNs in full groups, all the way from 40s to 60s.  No way my
enchanter was going to solo them.  Does that fact that I enjoyed them
make me worthy of your pity?

If so, I pity you.
