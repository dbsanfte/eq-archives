Looks interesting,I have some questions.
Most important are 2 and 2a,feel free to ignore the rest.

1) Is the online manual uptodate ?

2)Is grouping required to solve quests or make progress?

2a)Is it like EQ,where its sometimes impossible to find a group
for hours?

3)What about dieing and loosing *all* your stuff?
Sounds scary to me,or is it more like UO with easy
to replace equipment?

4)Are the servers in Germany ? - I have very good con
to their homepage,being German myself.

5)What about the Karma system ? -Sounds nice,but also
looks like they need a lot of admins to enforce it.

6)How about lag,server downtime and general stability?

7)Any fan websites you can recommened ?

The more I think about the "secure item transfer for rl money poll",
the more I begin to wonder what else than an overwhelming 
negative response they expected,maybe they live on another 
planet.  :)

Meldur (pretty fed up with EQ atm)
