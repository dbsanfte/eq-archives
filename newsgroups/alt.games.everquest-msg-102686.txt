A lot of the times I'm in the game, I see various arguments (some seem
over very trivial and meaningless things) with people shouting
obcenities at each other.  The most popular is misunderstandings in
groups and misunderstandings with pulling creatures that escalate into
people leaving or going off like a timebomb.  

Stop for a moment and think about who the person on the other end
might be.  It could be a child, a senior citizen, or a terminally ill
person.  Many people play EQ as a source of enjoyment, so I just
wanted to make this post in hopes that it will make a few people stop
and think before they go off on one another after a  misunderstanding
or incident online.

You could be talking to someone who literally has months or weeks to
live or who is unable to get outside and enjoy many other things life
has to offer.   You never know who is at the other end and what their
situation is.  Being kind and being some sort of a friend will make a
huge difference to everyone in the game.

Thanks for your time.
