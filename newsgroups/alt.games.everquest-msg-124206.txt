That's because the guild chat rooms are just chats started and kept in
existence by the guilds involved.  There can't be an official list because
not all guilds use them and when they are used they aren't always used for
long.  Most of time the chats are used by guilds on raids and only last that
long.  Some of the guilds form alliances with several other guilds, then
there is usually a chatchannel just for the allies to talk on, those are
usually passworded also, that way people from several different guilds can
talk just like they were in the same guild. Ingame type in /help chat for
more info.
