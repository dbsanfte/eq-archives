Feel free.  I've noticed in all your strategy posts, you elect for safety
over any semblance of performance.  Nothing I post will ever interest you
until you start to play like you're not scared of the game.  :P

I just found it interesting that A) you were rushed getting to a named
*after* the adventure was over, and B) *because* of that you ran into a
situation where you were nearly overwhelmed.  But hey, I'm the one that
plays risky.  :)
