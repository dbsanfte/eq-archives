Eh, I wouldn't assume that out of hand.  I learned about EQ while playing
Legends of Kesmai.  I was totally happy with LOK and some of the people who
told me about EQ coming out also liked LOK.  I played and subsequently
became addicted to EQ and left LOK, but the worst thing I said about LOK to
anyone was that the graphics were much better in EQ.

My point being, I'm sure that many people will leave EQ because their
friends talk them into trying out this new addicting game, not because of a
serious dislike of EQ.  And who knows, maybe they'll tell a new ex-UO person
about EQ (I'm sure many UO players don't know anything about EQ, despite our
newsgroups) and when they hear they won't be ganked, they decide to check
out EQ.
