    This was the way it used to be. It's much better now, and the two drop
rates are much more in sync across all planes.

    If you want them right now right now right now, yes. As much as I might
disagree, Verant has decided that spells are valuable upgrades for casters
and to obtain them should require effort. Just like when Kunark came out and
you couldn't get any of the non-vendor 55+ spells without effort.

    Again, mostly from the first few weeks when the drop rates were messed
up. Now they drop about as often as stuff from those named spiders in
Velk's. The reason it seems so common, as with the Velks spiders, is the
place is being camped almost 24/7 and a lot of the people that win these
things don't want them and sell them.

    Nice belt. Far from "badass", given the level limit gimping on them. I
still prefer my Bone-Clasped Girdle, and there's a ton of them floating
around.

    So one can never have a droppable item that's better than a quested
weapon, meant to be done in the mid-50's to level 60, that was released
three expansions ago? As with the items that come from Cazic Thule, and put
most of the stuff from Veeshan's Peak to shame: get over it. It's
mudflation, and it's not going away.
