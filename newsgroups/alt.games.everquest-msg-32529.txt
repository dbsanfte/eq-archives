I just did 3 of my quests...now I'm just looking for a shovel to complete
that one.

Allakhazam's says "frost giant" but if you talk to the quest giver they
actually do say "ice giant."  Annnddd, ice giant toes worked just fine.

I also got the toes from Gornit.  And yes, if anyone asked me for toes while
I was killing him I would have had no problem giving them to the person.

I bought my gargoyle eye from the merchant on the sister isle.  I didn't
feel like hunting a gargoyle down to get it for myself.  I did kill mermaids
though, since I knew from previous experience the former was an uncommon
(but not horribly so) drop, and the latter was common.
