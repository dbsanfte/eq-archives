I'm still not sure exactly what your fascination is with having folks run
across Norrath.  There's just nothing spectacular to see in WK ... or OOT
... or Tim Deep ... or Erud's Crossing ... or <insert large zone here>.

It sounds to me like a case of "I did it, therefore you must do it".  Which,
quite frankly, is no reason to do anything.

Maybe in your gaming experience something really neat happened during a long
run, and you want other to have that chance.  That's nice, and thanks for
the philanthropy, but I'd wager 90% of the gamers find travel a useless
waste of what precious little gaming time we have.  It has nothing to do
with the levelling treadmill, either ... I don't want to run my happy ass
halfway across Norrath from hunting in SK if I'm in the mood to tradeskill,
either.

Just a suggestion .... you might want to investigate the Microsoft 'Flight
Simulator' series.  You may well enjoy the travel there too.
