    If there's that many General Chats, forget about getting any useful
information. The likelihood of penetrating the spam in those forums is
inversely proportional to the number of them up (they spawn extra chats as
people join, lots of chats = something big messed up = lots of angry
people).

    I've never understood why people whine to the chat GMs during a big
issue, as most of them can do nothing about anything. Wait until servers
come back up, see what impact this has had on your raid/XP group/tradeskill
session, THEN petition and get whiny if you are denied satisfaction. At
least you'll be whining to someone that can do something about it.

    At least it makes it easy to spot the morons. No need to read their
drivel, stop once you've seen the screen name.

    Kinda gives "the customer is always right" a whole new spin, doesn't it?
