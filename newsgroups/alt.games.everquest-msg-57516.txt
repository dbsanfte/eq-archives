I recently upgraded to Windows XP and everything has gone smoothly on this
PC. My old PC has two hard drives and somehow I ended up with 2 installs of
XP one on each HD. I use one HD for Windows and programs and the other one
for MP3s. With windows fully installed on the 2nd hard drive it is nearly
full. I tried to format it from within windows but it says that it is in
use. Is there any way I can make an XP boot disk so I can format the hard
drive and just have my MP3s on it?
