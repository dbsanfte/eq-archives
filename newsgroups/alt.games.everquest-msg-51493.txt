Looking at the above three methods for "efficiency"

Method one:

Roots did 60 damage while sticking 6 times in 17 casts,
for a total of 595 mana, or point one damage per mana spent.

Stinging swarms did 234 damage while sticking 3 out of 3 casts,
for a total of 195 mana, or 1.2 damage per mana spent

Method two

Careless lightning did 865 damage while sticking 10 out of 10 casts
(one for only 1 damage, the other nine for full damage)
For a total of 700 mana, or 1.236 damage per mana spent

Method three

Careless Lightning did 384 damage, full stick in 4 of 4 casts
for a total of 280 mana, or 1.37 damage per cast

Stinging swarm did 234 damage, full stick in 2 or 2 casts,
for a total of 130 mana, or 1.8 damage per cast-
increase in efficiency due to using first "Stand still and
fight me" and then "its running" techniques to avoid the
loss of 1/3rd effect while the mob is chasing me...
except that as the mob died before the swarm wore off,
this isn't really accurate, the second swarm did -not- have
full 117 damage effect.  Another careless lightning probably
would have been a better course.

Barbcoat did 28 damage
For a total of 50 mana, or .56 damage per cast
(but will run thru about 5 battles in a row, making its
effieciency more like 2.5 damage per mana over its full run)

Shield of Barbs did 130 damage
for a total of 60 mana or a shocking 2.166666 damage per mana.

Melee did 112 damage
Spent 70 mana on buffs for melee, for a 1.6 efficiency...
but likely none of that mana made any real difference,
leaving an "undefined" 112/0 efficiency to consider.  Of
course the time spent killing the mob once it started
running was time that could have been spent medding,
more likely a good solid careless lightning or two to clean
up would have yeilded better time spent.

AN alternative way to look at this would be

Barbcoat (always on, so don't count as cost)
Shield of Barbs
Melee

Combined damage during active portion of fight 197 points,
real mana cost 60, or an efficiency of 3.28 damage per mana
expended...and the shield had more time to run, too, so in a longer
fight we'd see both melee and the DS damages going up higher
for the same mana cost.

When I pull several blue mobs, my melee damage doesn't
go up, but the number of times I get hit while the DS is up
increases dramatically, so the efficiency of the spell line
goes thru the roof... always assuming I don't die, of course!
