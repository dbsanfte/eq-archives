yes its that hard . A monk can easily lose 30 ac the FIRST Time he gets an
autosplit . He would have to destroy coins (9 mouse clicks per mob killed)
after every mob.

Also if you need money and are letting others loot counting on the autosplit
then you are a noob . Autosplit is not even remotely even , the looter gets
the lion share and may make 1000 times as much as you do sitting on your ass
:p
