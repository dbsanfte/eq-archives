There is one dragon in the game that has a disease attack.  Other than that it
is useless.  It's not worth worrying about your resists on the off chance that
some random shaman/necro mob might cast a disease DoT at you.


Of course, due to class and circumstance, I generally get less benefits out of
resist gear than most, so I generally don't worry about it much.   I have all
the basic jewelery and common pieces, but no point in tracking down the really
good hard to get pieces, since I almost never get a chance to wear them. ; )
