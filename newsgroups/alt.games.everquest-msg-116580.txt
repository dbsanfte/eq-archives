Well, it depends, are their only 5 mobs spawning in an area?  Do they drop 
something quest related?  Is that the only place it drops?  Has the bard 
been monopolizing the spawn for 3 straight days?

Nope, not at all, but if the King dropped an epic item, and there were 6 
spots where the King spawned, and a single group was monopolizing all the 
spawns, then you have the right to share the spawns.  Whether you take 3 
and they take three, or you alternate on each mob, you still have the 
right to share.

The AC is a different mob, and even Verant understands that.  Well, at 
least the AC you're talking about, in OOT.  The one in SRo though is an 
entirely different beast.  You're not going to honestly try and tell me 
that if you're killing sandtrash in SRo, and someone comes along and sees 
the AC up, that they can't kill it because you cleared the sandtrash, are 
you?

> No ifs, no buts, he is mine.. and I'll do what I can to protect my camp.

So you're basically saying that it's OK to monopolize a camp basically 
permanantly as long as you have force?  What about the guilds that move 
into a zone and just won't leave?  Basically, as long as they can keep a 
force active the zone is theirs?  How about the person who had 4 accounts 
and moved into Kedge Keep permanantly?  It happened on Innoruuk.  Within a 
month or so of nobody else being able to get any Phinny drops, and 
repeated attempts to work out an amiable solution, PNP was invoked every 
time anyone else came into the zone.  It didn't take long at all before 
the GMs were encouraging him to camp elsewhere.

I agree that in 95% of the cases PNP is bullshit.  Mature adults can work 
out a rotation, share the spawns, or even join forces.  My guild was 
planning on farming crowns in PoA Isle 7 tonight, but another guild 
mentioned that they plan to go there also tonight. There is a third guild 
that generally has a farm team up there.  According to your logic any one 
of us should be able to monopolize the camp as long as we want.  I'm 
sorry, I just think that's selfish and foolish.
