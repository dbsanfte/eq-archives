http://www.gucomics.com  I guess were famous now?

Anyway, still down.  So far just one "prexus is now up" broadcast (lies!)
and lots of waiting.

What pisses me off the most, is I scheduled today and tomorrow as some time
to finally work on leveling my mage, now i spent all that plat on him.  Well
today I exped a fair few hours (semi PL), and Im going to lose every scrap
of exp from today

Fuck, I'ma just go back to partying on a weekend night =(
