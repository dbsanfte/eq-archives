I don't know if it's like this for everyone, but when I create a new 
character (on either account I used to have), the default size of the bazaar 
search window was set so that the Hide Traders button wasn't visible...it 
was off to the side and I had to resize the window to see it...because I 
knew it was there. How many new people playing didn't know the Hide Traders 
button was even there because they never resized that window?
