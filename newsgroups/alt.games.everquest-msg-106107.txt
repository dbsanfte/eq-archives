Bah! That's how I always end up being an officer... :)

}10) Guildmembers can actually get promoted to guildleader and grand
}poobah if they can get a date with Lady Shae in Freeport. It has to be
}an actual date with her, no going up to her room, thats too easy after
}giving her a bunch of wine. You have to actually take her somewhere to
}eat and maybe take in a show over by the Monk's guild. Bonus time if
}the date ends with you running for the zone with her chasing you. Even
}more bonus points if your real life mate catches you dating Lady Shae
}(male or female) and you have to run for the zone in real life with
}your mate chasing you with a frying pan.

Heh, I was just thinking about that the other day... how many other people 
in Hogcaller's Inn would aggro if I were to charm her, or that dwarf 
guy...  If they were charmed, and led outside of FP gates, certain evil 
alts of mine could get felwithe and kelethin factions pretty quick.

(Without screwing up Indigo Brotherhood.  That's key.  Don't even start 
with me about crushbone orcs. :) )
