Hi all!

Please forgive the intrusion, but I'm writing a book about EverQuest for 
McGraw-Hill, and I was rather hoping to get some amusing anicdotes about 
the gameplay.

The book itself is not a strategy guide...it's more of a history of the 
game, and a look at the issues and community around it.  I'll have 
material on various guilds, how they were formed, and what they do, I'll 
cover some of the social issues such as EverQuest addiction, and even 
take a guess at what is to come (and yes, I'll have interviews with the 
developers).

Essentially, I want to have each chapter contain a sidebar with an 
EverQuest story.  Something along the lines of "I logged on one day and 
x happened."  So, I was wondering if anybody had some good stories to 
share...funny, insightful, I'm interested in them all.  And, the best 
ones will appear in the book when its published in May.

Best regards to all,

Robert Marks

PS: For those who are interested, I've most recently been a columnist on 
Diabloii.net; my column is titled "Garwulf's Corner", and can be found 
at www.diabloii.net/garwulfs.
