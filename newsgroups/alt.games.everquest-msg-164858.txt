Or maybe you don't have a clue?  Druids can solo mobs with right click
freebies (hello Epic!) for Snare/Root and DoTs/DDs so do those items
need to go from the game?

I saw a Bard solo *3* dark blue mobs in Chardok using non-mana songs
and his right click NukeBoots (tm) so I guess those need nerfing, huh?

Only thing I've soloed in PoP (AM3/EQ/Primal Bow yadda yadda) was a
Treant in PoN and it took [from my logs] 7.5 minutes.  I got lucky and
Ensnare stuck first time and each of the 4 Roots I used lasted a
reasonable amount of time otherwise you can easily add a couple of
minutes onto that time.  Had Ensnare not stuck first time (and it
often doesn't in PoP) you can factor in 3 or 4 Chloroblasts as I heal
back the damage the mob did when I was trying to channel through its
assault.  On and BTW the only reason I attempted it was some chimp had
parked it at the zone in point/GY otherwise I wouldn't have bothered.

Don't even get me started about the bugs in the LoS missle code.

NB: It's now changed back on Test.
