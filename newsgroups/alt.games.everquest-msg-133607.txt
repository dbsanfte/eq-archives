    When an officer uses their judgement as to how much someone's
intangibles have aided the guild, nobody can second-guess their weightings
because nobody knows their weightings. As soon as you say "doing our strat
for mobX is the same as showing up to Y raids", you'll have people saying
it's too little. You'll have people saying it's too much. You'll have people
contributing to strategy discussions that have no business doing so but want
the phat strat points. All because people now know exactly how valued a
given activity is.

    That's good for players, bad for the guild as a whole. As soon as people
see what the system is, they'll look for all the rules-lawyerish ways to get
maximal return out of the system with minimal investment. With something
like officer awards, you know what the officers like but have no way of
knowing what they like more so you tend over time to do whatever it is
you're comfortable with doing and capable of doing.

    That's the biggest problem with officer choice. A smart set of officers
have some facts they can spring on anyone that doesn't have a legitimate
beef, like number of raids between loot, choice of raids attended,
intangibles contributed, etc.

    Bidding creates its own set of headaches. How do you set the minimum bid
(or else you will get collusion)? How do you handle stuff that's going to
rot even though it would help someone because that minimum bid was set too
high? Systems with bidding favour classes with low numbers in a guild - will
the bidding system make people oppose recruiting in their class simply on
the grounds that it would hurt them in terms of loot?

    The difference being I don't know what makes an officer like me by how
much. So I can't make decisions like "I'd go res Buddy, but I lead all the
clerics by enough points as is. Someone else can do it." All I know is going
to res Buddy will look good, and not ressing Buddy will look bad (the
possibility that not doing good things = NEGATIVE points in the eyes of
officers).

    Now that I think about it, I think that point may explain a lot. An
officer choice system has at the least the perception that there are
penalties for not acting in the interests of the guild. In a points system,
you can see exactly whether failing to do something will change your
standing in any way. In officer choice, the possibility of penalty makes
determining standing much more difficult and makes players more likely to
try and improve standing.

    We have a wizard that makes a point of being the last person out of
every raid she's on, translocating everyone out at the end. In fact, she's
quite verbal about that being her role, and will send nasty tells to any
wizard that tries to stay later than her. She's also quite verbal about her
role when it comes time to award loot. I have NO doubts that if we went to
points and no rewards were allocated for translocating people out at the end
that she'd be Gating as soon as any caster loot was decided and she'd done a
few token x-loc's.

    Actually, it would. The reason she gets loot out of whack with her
attendance is bcause most of her loot is quest-related (not raid-related),
and because recently the rogues in guild have mostly all had personal life
issues and she's one of the few that are at raids. So she gets the
Khalziwhateveritscalled because she's there and what other rogues are
present are too junior to merit it. This would happen points or not due to
class-specific items.
