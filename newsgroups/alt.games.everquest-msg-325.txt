No, you don't remember correctly. I posted opinions about a game I was
playing.

You were wrong and instead of admitting it, tried the intimidation bit. When
that didn't work either, you changed the subject and started crowing about a
kick to the balls. A strange metaphor, for a newsgroup, and one that is very
telling.

The posts are there for anyone to read. You love digging out old posts,
re-read them.

Someone who answers a post with a deliberate, abrasive and abusive tone,
designed to inflame the recipient and prompt him to try and answer in the
same vein. Baiting people to descend into his own abysmal darkness, and
trying to make them compete on his home ground. Someone who knows full well
what the consequences of his post might be, and who obviously enjoys the
attention it is certain to bring.

I think that fits the bill nicely.

What is it with you and this obsession with male genitalia?  You have
something you wish to tell us?
