    Depends on the situation, and the consumer protection laws in your area,
as to whether the defense will work or not. EQ has no consumer protection
laws. :-(

    But not good enough advertising to warrant GM intervention. We've had a
few cases like this on Quellious, and in one a GM was brought in. The GM
stated that if the seller did not engage in any deception in a public
channel that the sale was final, as players in The Bazaar are free to price
items however they choose. Had the seller said a single thing in a public
channel that was deceptive, though, the GM could have reversed the deal as a
trade scam and given a warning to the seller which would include forbidding
him from similar pricing in the future. Even though you and I know what the
seller was trying to do, to remain fair that's the best a GM can do.
