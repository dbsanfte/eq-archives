Hmmm ... there's a thought.  I hadn't even considered Warsliks.  I was
thinking of possibly heading to Everfrost for mammoths, but even with track
they're so hit-and-miss.  One minute there aren't any around, five minutes
(and a few dead Giant Wooly Spiders later) you can't swing a dead snow
leopard in a circle without hitting 6 of the furry things.

Thanks for the info, Tukka.  Much obliged.  :-)
