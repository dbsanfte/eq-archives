Very cool that address my most immediate concerns.

But for the sake of throwing more possibilities at you:

Can I invite people to my group during an engagement?
Can people disband during an engagement? 

ie can i invite uberdrood to the fight (during or before), have him heal 
and ds, me during, and then just before the mob dies, have him disband 
(so what if ds fades at that point!)? What happens to loot/xp?

Can I smack mobs down to 2% and then zone or Feign? And let twinkie 
finish them off?

And of course, even if I can't CH you -during- the fight I can reduce 
Downtime to 0, by CHing between each fight. 

And I can single pull for you, by engaging other mobs in the way, 
letting you engage the "one thats left" and pulling it to a safe area, 
and then zoning/fd to release my crowd.

On the other side of the coin, is there any way to grief by engaging 
mobs, 'calling for help' to kill xp/loot on the encounter, and then 
mezzing/rooting/slowing. And then laughing your little punk ass off as 
some unsuspecting individual/group engages the mob, kills it, and 
watches the corpse poof?
