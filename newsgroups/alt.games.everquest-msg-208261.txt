If you have any intention of actually playing this character, load those 2
spells every time you log in and summon a stack of 20 each.  You'll thank me
later (right around the time you get your first good nuke at level 8, a
spell my magician still sometimes mems at 65 for interrupt value).  The
least resisted and most efficient magician nukes are conjuration.  Summoning
your starting kit will keep your skill up (because magician isn't like
wizard, you aren't nuking constantly), as well as simply saving money for a
non-twink.

I'm using that spell on my magician for the first time ever regularly, now
that I have a charm spell that requires a summoned target.  :)  It's a
pretty useless spell.  You'll find counterparts for most of the cleric
anti-undead spells in your lineup, but the *extreme* lack of summoned mobs
make most all of them a joke.

Your pet doesn't have that much hp at low levels either, so you'll have to
do some off-tanking.

You'll level faster if you remember one thing.  Always do one point of
damage.  Keep that cheap level 1 nuke memmed and tag everything with it. 
Otherwise you're losing exp to your pet at a pretty hefty rate.  Another
advantage to keeping the level 1 nuke memmed is after you get the
conjuration based nuke it keeps your evoc skill from falling behind (I can
only recommend specializing in conjuration for a magician.  Even moreso for
a non-twink).
