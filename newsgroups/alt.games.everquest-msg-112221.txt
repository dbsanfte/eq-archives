  What Absor is saying here is that it's more difficult to address a laundry
list of ideas coming from 400 people, than it is to address 1 idea sent in
by 1 person.  In this case, a group of people are banding together to tell
them that THEIR laundry list of ideas is a bad idea.

  But anyway, this is why I am personally trying to focus on getting them to
hold off on the raising of 3 character limit.  The other rules may be
damaging to the server (in my opinion), but this one, I feel, will do the
most damage, and it's the one they can't change their mind on.

  And the petition that's being signed is rather simple in concept: SLOW
DOWN.  There isn't 400 people giving 4000 different ideas, suggestions and
criticisms.  There's a bunch of people with pretty much the same criticism.

  Time is of the essence if we're to have a prayer of changing their minds,
or getting them to delay implementation of this patch (and maybe we don't
have a prayer, but it's better to try and fail than to not try at all).  I
have a feeling that one person sending in an extremely well presented
message about why one of the changes they're going to be implementing is a
bad idea, would probably not reach the ears of anybody whom it concerns in
time.  However, if 100, 200, 400 or a thousand people implore Verant to HOLD
UP FOR A MINUTE, maybe a more reasoned discussion can follow.

  I'm sure they don't want to upset the people who bought into Firiona Vie
and made it their home in EQ... but that's exactly what they'll be doing for
the majority of us if these changes go in.  Though many of us have great
criticisms of the changes going in, the one criticism that almost everyone
has is that these changes are being rolled in WAY too quickly.
