Druids are great at root, but if that's the only reason they were
mentioned as CC, then they should have mentioned wizards, shamans,
clerics, and rangers.  I suppose what a druid has over the cleric and
wizard is the ability to get aggro *fast and cheap* with snare, drag a mob
away, then root it...but arguably a ranger is better at this because they
can take the beating better...and a shaman with virulent paralysis is
pretty darned spiffy at CC (and I've never known a shaman who couldn't
grab aggro fast :P).

So yeah, including druids with enchanters and bards made me scratch my
head too.  NOthing against druids, I just don't think of them as the kings
of ghetto mezz...if I had to consider one of the rooting classes "best",
I'd go for my own (barring the shaman who has VP...that skill still rocks
my world)...and if I had to pick one class to actually do it, I'd pick
shaman, because their DPS is least likely to be missed. *cough*
