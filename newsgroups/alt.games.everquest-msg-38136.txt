My char has been playing EQ for about 5 months, long enouth to know
his way around some of the zones in  Antonica, mostly Qynos,  Freeport
E/W Comm, Kith, Highpass Hold/Keep,  The Oasis,  No/So Ro  and
Karana, and get to lvl 27. Can't help but notice char's auctioning
stuff in  East Comm/No Ro tunnel for thousands of plat, like 10,000 up
to 25,000for one item and many have several items at these prices! How
does one acummulate that kinda $$?. My char has earned maybe 2400-2800
selling loot and doing minor quest, since starting. Most of that was
spent on food/water and some armorment and a weapon. Most of the stuff
he wears came from looting. The most plat he has seeen is from a HQ
bear skin (50 pp). NPC's like Gnolls, Orcs And Pickclaws drop some
small coins Maybe up to about 10 pp from a Pick. I know that some
quest items bring good plat, but It seems to me that a char would have
to play 12 up hrs a day 24/7 To come up with thousands, based on his
limited experience. So, Where does all this BIG plat come from?

Hmm...
