Ok.  I've been playing EQ since a month after it started.  I have a 53
shaman, 47 enchanter, 31 cleric, 22 warrior, and a bunch of level 10 to
20's.  My question is about loot.  My shaman doesn't even have good items.
Do people get their uber items from fighting in groups, or from farming?  I
never farm... I did it once, actually.. got some wolf fur slippers and
stuff, but thats it.  Is it a combination?  If I fight in Seb for a couple
hours straight, will I come out with a decent item?  After 11 months of
saving, I finally was able to afford a JBB last night, and that was only
because a friend got hold of one and gave it to me for 14kpp. (btw, it's so
nice to have =0P).  Alright, suggestions?  I guess I'm looking for a
different look into items and stuff.  I have a decently high level
character, I should be able to do stuff with him and get items, so how?

TIA
