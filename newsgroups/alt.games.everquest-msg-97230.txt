Like I said it depends on class and location, but believe me I'm not
the only one who's noticed.

Maybe it could *shrug* thats what they did with FoB and Shadeweavers
(NOT Hollowshade, avoid that zone like the plague!).

But even if they did there's no guarantee the newbies will know it. Us
smarts would know to fight the higher stuff but the noobs would
probably stay with the easy L1 kills that take forever to level on.

This does not change with the new patch. There's that overstating
effects again.....

I know it is, but as I said this change isn't like starting them at
L10. It just cuts the time down some.
