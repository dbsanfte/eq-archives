No I don't want to start a great debate or flaming session.

I recently bought Asherons Call 2, but although it's a good game the
European server is up and down like a yoyo.  This is a pain because I'm only
an occasional player, perhaps ever other day.  After a day at work I like to
unwind with a few hours questing and the despatching a few monsters.
However, this is not possible with the servers constantly up and down.

What I want to know is your views on Everquest before I take the plunge and
buy the game.  Are the European/UK servers reliable i.e. do they stay active
for more than four days in a row?.  How about the game play?  Are the
controls easy to master?  Can you use the mouse to control the direction you
move? Are players tolerant of new players to the realm?

I'm also concerned about PK's.  This isn't a problem in Asherons Call 2 as
there are specified areas for PvP play, how about Everquest?  How does it
deal with high level characters cleaving through newbies?

Thanks

Ian
