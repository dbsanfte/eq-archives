It's not 8 characters per account, it's 8 characters per server.  And
there is something like 40 servers.  Fill up all your character slots
on one server, you just move to another server and presto, 8 more
character slots.  

Only drawback you might see is that you can't twink across servers at
all since each server is it's own 'world'.
