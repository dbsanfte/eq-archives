That's not the point people (me included) are so pissed over AT ALL!

We've slogged thru the bad design, the nerfs, the unknown, the handicaps...
and we're damn PROUD of overcoming all that crap. BUT WE STILL DID IT,
despite the hardships. What is pissing us off, is the feeling that our hard
work is now being rendered pointless, and that any asswipe can come along
afterwards and get everything HANDED to them on a fucking PLATE!

You'll notice that the overlap between the people bitching about these new
changes, and the group pissed over Stormhammer is pretty large. That's
because we feel we're getting shafted. EQ has always been about earning your
rewards... even something as lame as level 6 CR out into East Commons in
time to save your precious new banded mail that you'd slaved damn hard to
aquire is now history... a joke.

Now every twinkass lowbie in full Crafted can treat risk/reward with utter
contempt because there is NO risk anymore.... "Overpulled one to many red
/cons? No biggie... don't even have to stop to loot my corpse anymore...
just keep on going"

Do a '/who all 60' next time you log on... if everything was that broken,
how did THEY succeed?

Yes it WILL be too easy. This NG is already littered with stories about
people rising up thru the levels and not having a CLUE about what to do in
any given situation when it's not 100% peachy. People are twinking and PLing
into the 50s and suddenly they want to be in a raid! Some of them can't even
SOLO properly without their pet Ebay cleric/enchanter/druid being run on a
2nd PC hauling their sorry arse out of the fire constantly, nevermind
group... something they could have been learning as early as level 5!

But let's not burden these poor people with all that pointless learning and
experience, shall we? Let's just let them open a Legends account where they
can start at 60 with their Epics pre-generated so they can /shout "i R
uber... i pwn pH4t l33wtz!" and bill them $40/month for the ego-stroke.
