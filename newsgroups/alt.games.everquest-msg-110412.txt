Get a life.  GMs  dont have anything to do with class abilities.  And
a GM helping you with epic,  I about laughed out of my chair.  Who are
you kidding.  Go twinking somwhere else.   I worked for all my levels,
and if you really had a life, you would understand, IT IS JUST A
GAME!!.  If you dont like it, go play somewhere else.
