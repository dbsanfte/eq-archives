Replying to my own post.  Damn I did not describe my point good enough.
Point is that as you become a super power nukage or buffage machine I think
it is reasonable to believe you could handle at least one more spell in your
head than a newbie.  That was my only point.  And with AAs for just about
every other thing why not try an AA that gives you nine gem slots instead of
eight?
