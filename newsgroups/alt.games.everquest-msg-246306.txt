Since the new tradeskill interface was added, you skill listed inside the
tradeskill window reflects any skill mod items you may be wearing.  If you
have 200 skill and a 5% geerlock inside the tradeskill window your skill
will be listed as 210.  In the skills window that lists all your skills, it
will not reflect mod items and thus will read 200.
