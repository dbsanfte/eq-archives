Help me to end an argument ongoing in my Guild right now.

The argument is about how you get stats from magical food/drink items.

I had always believed that you had to have the food/drink in the very top
left spot in your inventory for it to work. To avoid eating/drinking it all
(and losing the stats) you would try to eat other foods manually as much as
possible. This works fine for me.

However in guild last night a newbie asked about how to get stats from some
Pickled Wurm he had been given. Before I had a chance to reply a guild
member told him he had to eat it - and so he did :) I went on to have a
'chat' to this guild member and told him my theory on how we get stats from
this stuff...

Now - he now realises that you CAN get it from having it in the top spot
because I was able to prove it to him (look at stats, add Wurm to top slot,
look at stats again - oh my, it increased!) but... he told me that...

a) VI says you have to eat it (not sure where he got this from)
b) The fact that it gives you stats from the top slot must be a bug of some
kind whereby the game engine "assumes" that you are going to eat that next,
because you always eat what is in that slot first, and then gives you the
"benefit of the doubt" and applies the stats anyway

Personally I just think he didn't want to admit he was wrong - but then
again all I've ever been told is to put it in that slot. I've never heard
that it might be a bug that allows that to happen.

Does anyone have any insight as to the INTENDED way to get stats from these
foods/drinks - because I would really like to know if it's meant to do that,
or is just a bug that may be nerfed some day and you're really supposed to
be consuming the items......

Thanks!

Schylaar
