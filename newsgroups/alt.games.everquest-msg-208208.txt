Because an Enchanter who uses Alacrity in a melee heavy group
does _not_ have mana?

Assuming no item haste and damage only from melee (i.e. no DoTs,
no DDs, no damage shields) 1.36 vs. 1.22 gives a whopping 9.8%
increase in damage output.  If there is any item haste involved,
if there are pets that are not receiving the same haste buffs,
or if there are any spells damaging the mobs, you will get less
benefit than that.  Oh, and while the 5ac and 19agi from a L29
casting of Augmentation won't make a huge difference, it will
slightly reduce damage taken.

So much for the benefit of Alacrity, now for the cost.  Assuming
you are hasting 4 melees (you did specify a melee heavy group)
and you have Mana Preservation 2 and Spec. Alt. 50 (no idea what
"real" Enchanters specialize, so assume for the moment it is
something else):
Augmentation cost = (((90*.875=79)*4)/27.0) = 11.7 / minute.
Alacrity cost = (((115*.875)=101)*4)/6.8) = 59.4 / minute.
For comparison, standing mana regen with L29 Clarity is 50/minute
and sitting is ca. 140/minute (assumes maxed med skill and +1
per tick for every 12.5 med).

So, at slightly more than 5x mana cost (very nearly half the
total mana available to the Enchanter) your group could do 11.5%
more damage vs. time spent in melee.  Works great if the only
thing the Enchanter is doing is casting Clarity on himself and
a healer and Alacrity on your 4 melees.  OTOH, if the Enchanter
is required to be anything beyond a buff whore it will cause
downtime waiting for him to med.  Another possible side effect
is that the Enchanter decides that tradeskilling wasn't half as
boring and unpleasant as wiping the noses of a bunch of whiney
melee brats and waves you all goodbye.
