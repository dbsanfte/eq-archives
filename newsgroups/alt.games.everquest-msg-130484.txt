This argument usualy comes from the despotic types.  They may well have
nothing to hide.  By now, they've learned that the international community
will condemn them, no matter what they do, it's best just to tell the to go
screw themselves.

I guess news does travel slow to the Old World.  Hawaii's a state now, has
been for a while.

The mere fact that they're throwing around their weight does not make it
wrong.   Might may not always make right, but it doesn't always make wrong,
either.

The west bank belongs to Isreal, Transjordan belongs to the palestinians.
What does that have to do with the PA's flag?

True, Isreal has the power to stop the siege.  They would be stupid to do
so, though.  Palestine has refused to stop the violence every time Isreal
lets up.  You can try to divert from that as much as you want, but the fact
remains.
