it is my understanding this can only be acomplished with the 7.1 channel
speaker package that you can buy for audigy cards/etc

if you use the optical cable like I do you will only get 2 channel audio
unless a program (like power dvd for example) can specifically send a dolby
digital/dts signal for the receiver to understand and use... this is because
the optical data stream can only send 1 compressed (dolby digital/dts)
stream at once, or 2 channels uncompressed (left and right) (I may be off on
this but this is the way I understand it to be)


what you would want to look for is the audiohq icon in control panel and go
to device controls/decoder and set SPDIF passthrough if you use an optical
cable or digital coax cable, and then pray that somehow works to your
advantage with eq (I dont use sound anymore in eq so I dont know how GoD
works in that area)

or if you have the 7.1 channel speaker package turn the onboard decoder on
and then plug the 3 or 4 headphone style jacks into the back of the card.



I hope this helped more than it hurt.
