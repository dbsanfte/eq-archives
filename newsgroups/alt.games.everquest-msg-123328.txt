It took me literally weeks to find ol' Grizzie.  I tried all of the same
stuff as you. Problem is a lot of folks are trying to kill him so the minute
he pops (which is maybe once a real day?) he's dead.  Keep trying though as
the BP is good stuff. Maybe find a Ranger who can help you hunt?  Good luck.
