Chess is 64 squares, 32 pieces, and it took a MASSIVE and specialized
computer that is not available for general use. Chess is a finite game on a finite
field of play. Also, those computer programs cheat, they have opening books
that are stored, which cut out a lot of calculations. The computer/program deep
blue didn't out 'think' anyone, it simply used brute force calculations. We already
know computers can crunch numbers faster than a human being so I see no
reason why anyone should be surprised that a computer 'beat' a human at
chess, it was inevitable.

Take the number of mobs in a zone, times the number of possible paths
and decisions a mob can/should make, times the number of zones, and then
keep track of thousands of players and everything they are doing, multiply
that by all the other calculations the servers have to do, like keeping track of
Dots, attack and damage calculations, buffs, hitpoints, mana, etc. etc. Not trivial
is an understatement.

Anything other than the rudimentary A.I. implemented in EQ would bring most
supercomputers to their knees. Let alone a reasonably affordable server Verant
has access to.

Having said that, while it is a daunting task, improvements can be made. There
are pathing and decision tree algorithms that are less intensive that Verant could use
to improve some aspects of mobs behavior and A. I.
