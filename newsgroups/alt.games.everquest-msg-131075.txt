This happened on my daughters computer.  I called tech support about it.
YES -there really is a tech support.  What I was told is this problem comes
from having the same resolution in Windows that you have in the game.  You
have to change one of them and that will solve the problem.  It did for my
daughter.  Hope this helps.
