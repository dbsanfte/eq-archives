Hehe, guildie just posted this on my guild boards, and havent seen it 
here, so here it comes:



Lords of EverQuest is a revolutionary Real-Time Strategy game inspired 
by the lore of the online gaming phenomenon EverQuest. Control Lords and 
colossal armies as you battle for total domination of the lands of 
Antonica.


* Featuring bad pathing - Mobs will suddenly warp on top of you! Your 
troops will wander off in a random directions regardless of waypoints, 
orders or enemy units.

* Bad patching, we'll release patches with a list of things that they 
will fix, forget to implement half of them, break other totally 
unrelated things and of course ensure that all of your save games are 
deleted or made unusable

*Incredible magic effects, which will slow movement to a crawl (see 
below), make units impossible to see and definatly not do what you 
*thought* the spells were going to do.

* Incredibly high minimum requirements. Ignore what the box has written 
on it, we just copied that from some other game we had around the 
office, you havent seen graphic lag like this before!
