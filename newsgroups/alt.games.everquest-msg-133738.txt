Nope you're just then only person it bothers when used out of context in a
post.

Hint;
Most people type as they speak, some proof read and try to correct typos and
grammatical errors but I can't count the amount of times I have used "one"
isntead of "won" or "no" instead of "know."
It's not because I don't know any different or because I am lazy when typing
or writing, it's just that when you type a post it's generally a rushed
reply and not a thought out piece of text like an email or letter.

CF
I know exactly when and where to use Their, They're and There but buggered
if I can ever get it right when typing a post.
