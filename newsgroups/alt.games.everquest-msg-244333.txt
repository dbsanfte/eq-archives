I think a cleric would be preferable to just about any melee, especially in
a place like time. I don't think their preference for the cleric really
means shit about rangers

Utility goes a long way to being "core function" gimmick.  And yes, at the
high end too.  its a little difficult to order GoD raiding zones.. but
perhaps the second highest current raiding zone, we use rangers as a method
of CC.  Add to this their melee DPS, WS, TS, buffs..  monks offer 1 thing
only just about per raid.  Whilst ranger skills might night be needed every
single raid, to say theres no place for them is ludicrous.

Because upto like 500DPS from TS isn't something to make you think "ooo,
glad we had rangers along to the raid today"?
Be it potime or crazy GoD fights, believe me its noticable.

Who has recently (near or distant past, i don't mind) gotten weaponshield?
No class comes to mind..

What spell/class/skill did you have in mind when you said this?

Parses?

On the final 2 rocks of PoTime phase 3 (a good test mob, as theres no wall
in sight), the parses ALWAYS show multiple rangers (trueshot) in the top
spot, ahead of rogues who did use their disc.

I'd love to see what would make you think non-disc rogue dps > TS dps.  From
every parse I have ever seen or made myself, just the suggestion is
ludicrous.
