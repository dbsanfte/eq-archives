There's an Erudite merchant in South Ro, in the northwest corner of
the zone.  If you give him some gold (I seem to recall it is 10 gold,
but haven't done this in a long time), he gives you some random item
*AND* some experience.  Unless they've changed it recently, the XP is
pretty low (again, I don't remember, but it is either 1 XP point or 3
XP points), but the quest sure is easy.  For a mere few billion plat,
you could just stand there and buy your way to level 60! :-)
