"Right hand...meet left hand" is my guess.  Or because they no longer 
care about twinking.  A combo of both, probably.

*look peeved* A girl comes here with an honest whine and you have to 
give me useful suggestion.  What's wrong with you people!?  ;)

Well, to stay in the spirit of the whine, I'll carry on with 
this...fungi tunic would look sexy on vah shir (chain) and the fungus 
patch vest makes him look like a hunchback (plate graphic).  That's why 
he sold his JB BP and got a barbed ringmail tunic...didn't want to 
tolerate hunchback-ed-ness for anything other than, well, fungus patch 
vest.

I'm reaching, aren't I?
