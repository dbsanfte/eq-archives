Objection, your honor.

I would replace the word skills in the above with "better gear."   The more
time a guild has spent farming boss mobs, the easier they become, the less
people they take to drop.  For a lot of guilds, even uberguilds, "skill" has
little to do with anything.  The reason they can kill a mob with half the
people isn't that they're "that damn good" as they would love to believe...
but that they have weapons making thier damage dealers put out twice the DPS
of an equal level "just starting to raid" guild.  Their tanks have a few
thousand more hit points and require less healing.   Thier casters have
flowing thought items and are regaining mana up to 50% faster than the
unequipped guild's casters...   no wonder they can do it with less.

It makes a huge difference that they would much prefer to misrepresent as
pure skill.

Yes, experience makes a difference, and sometimes a big one... but take
those same people, lose thier Vex Thall gear and put *them* in planar armor
with a smattering of ToV here and there... and then lets see them make
Tunare an "easy bitch".   Then maybe I'll be impressed.
