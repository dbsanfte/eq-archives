Actually, they'd probably look a lot like the humanity we have...

The last thing I heard was that they'd traced all native americans back to 
4 comon female ancestors.  But I wasn't really paying attention.

By the way, did you know that polydactyly, having more than 5 fingers per 
hand, is a dominant trait?  I'm always suprised that it isn't more common.

Six fngers, yeah, why not.  But having two opposable thumbs per hand... I 
bet that'd -rock-.  Chopsticks would be so much easier to use.
