Druids are the second best damage casters in the end game.  They
have nukes across the big 3 damage types (cold/magic/fire).
and have the 2nd highest burst DPS.  The weakness of druids
nuking is the same as any damage caster - their sustained
DPS has not kept pace with the massive increases in Melee DPS.
