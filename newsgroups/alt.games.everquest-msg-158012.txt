Proc's cannot be relied upon, unless your dex is 200+ you can go an entire
fight without seeing one and then get 5 in a row the next one. I agree a
lifetap proc, like that of a bloodpoint, generates a lot of hate but a blood
point doesn't proc until 51, the best he could have at that level (36) is a
Venomous axe, which isn't a bad weapon to have but not something I would
rely upon to get aggro, consistently.
