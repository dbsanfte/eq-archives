No, you were correct.  Tyre is a variant of the spelling of tire that is 
mainly British.  That doesn't mean all Brits spell it that way, of 
course.

Take a look at Goodyear's UK page for examples of Brits spelling it that 
way:

   http://www.goodyear.co.uk/

They also spell it that way in Australia:

   http://www.goodyear.com.au/

Same goes for South Africa.

It looks like "tire" in Japan, when they use English.

As for Norway, I couldn't find any word on the Goodyear Norway sites 
that looked remotely like "tire" or "tyre". :-)
