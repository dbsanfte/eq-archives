  I suspected a possible processor issue to.

  I did a shout in LOIO last night while suspended in mid-air,
and several players responded that the same thing has 
happened to them, though rarely.  I have an AMD Duron 700mhz.
I asked 3 of the repondents if they had non-AMD processors,
two had Pentiums.  Not an AMD issue.  One respondent stated 
it was a longstanding problem, a GUI bug in his opinion from
which he had died 3 times, each time getting a GM exp res
and going on his way.  He was certain Verant would never admit
to it or fix it.
