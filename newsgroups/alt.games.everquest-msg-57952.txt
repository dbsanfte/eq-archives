My experience of Slate at level 39 was not so enjoyable.  Had just got KOS
to FP militia and was running through EC on my way to get a port from a
friend in WC, when I remembered I had to stock up on some food and water for
my trip.  Well, stop near an Inn, look around - only the guard Tolus who was
standing well away (green anyway).  Run in, start to mention to the merchant
my needs when WACK!!!!.  Damn I swear he must have been hiding in the room
next door waiting for me.  Instinctively my fingers span my character around
for the door, hitting hotkey 9 (jboots) as I did.  Then it happened...
No, I didn't just lag, I lagged AND then suffered memory loss.  Needless to
say I never made it to the door.

ONE DAY SGT SLATE!!!!!!!!!
