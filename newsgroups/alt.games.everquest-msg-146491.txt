On Wed I had a bad pull and got my warrior killed. As i was doing my
CR a server message came up that the zones would be going down for an
emergency patch in 10 minutes. No problem I thought I'm less than 2
minutes from my corpse.

I got to my corpse and started looting and the zones came down. When I
logged back on both my character and his corpse were naked.

I petitioned and recieved a reply form a Guide that a GM would be with
me shortly. 5 hours later still no GM. I continued to petition both
in-game and on the website since Wed. I have received 4 replies form
Guides during that time but have yet to speak with a GM.

I have 2 computers and 3 accounts so I'm able to leave my character
logged while waiting for a reply and play another account. I have
waited at least 20 hrs with my warrior logged on for a reply. I can
imagine the grief this would cause someone who had this happen to
their main and only had a single account.

Do I have any other options?
