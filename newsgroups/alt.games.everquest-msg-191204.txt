The first time I posted the question, there were 2 actual responses. In
fact, in this post I acknowledged those 2. This time around, I got some
really good ideas, so I don't quite see how I am "dense" as the answers are
pouring in nicely (this tim). I did not get any ideas from you, in fact you
wandered off topic like usual. From you, I got the usual
psuedo-intellectual, sarcastic, holier-than-thou bullshit.

Thanks to all the other that had great ideas though.
