I saw any number of methods for spawning the AC in SRo, and tried 
several of them, never had any luck.

I did kill him several times in OOT, however.  It was easy, if mind 
numbing, he spawned in one specific spot with a PH every ( some short 
predictable time.  6 minutes?  Its been a while).  Kill the PH, and go 
back to watching TV or something... or if you wanted to be productive, 
pull mobs over from the nearby Seafury island to kill in the meantime.

The OOT AC was higher level, so not quite as desirable, but far far far 
easier than any of the proposed methods for spawning the SRo AC, even 
had they worked.

The revamp of OOT may have changed this, the revamp of SRo may have 
changed that.  I haven't tried either since long before the changes.

Why?  Because there have been changes in the game since the heyday of 
JBoots:

For one thing, TBoots were added to the game.  For 5Kpp (a little more, 
even with best faction/cha, but around that) you can get boots that are 
almost as good; they are exactly the same except there is a short cast 
time instead of Insta Click.  5K is easier to get than spawning the 
Ancient Cyclops... and its easier these days than it once was.

For another, a slight change was made to PC running speed vs that of 
most mobs.  Once, we all ran slightly slower than mobs, which meant we 
could never escape them and had to survive being hit in the back all the 
way to a zone line.  Now, we're all slightly faster than most mobs, 
which means if we're unencumbered and don't get caught on the geometry, 
we can usually get away if we can just get out of reach in the first 
place... particularly with a little added boost from jumping early in 
the chase.

More visibly, the addition of the Run AA means almost everyone level 52 
or higher runs nearly as fast as JBoot speed without needing any item or 
buff.  You need to spend 6 points in the first tier of AA, and there 
really aren't any particularly useful ones other than Run, so its a rare 
person that doesn't do this.  Knowing you'll be buying that, its less 
vital that you go out and get JBoots to speed you up for the brief time 
until you get there.

And the bazaar and various SOW potions also badly hurt the JBoot trade. 
  SOW is faster than JBoots, and the potions have a decent duration, its 
quite possible to keep yourself SOWed for relatively little cash outlay.

Note that the potions and Run AA combine to make a really powerful 
counter argument; use potions to bridge that gap until you get run and 
never need the potions again... so the thought that the JBoots will pay 
off in the long run doesn't work either.

Fabled JBoots were something a lot of people were interested in, I was 
AFK during the Fabled month so I don't know how that panned out, but 
there might be some info in there which might also apply to spawning the 
regular AC if you're still interested.
