Tiny correction: The Bard Equivalent to Totemic/Ivy Etched would be 
Lambent.  Singing Steel is the dropped Bard armor from Kunark.

Many classes' armor of this type is quested in the Temple of Solusek Ro, 
off Lavastorm Mountains.  I know that includes Bards, Casters, Clerics, 
SKs... 

Warriors have Crafted (from Centaurs in SK), Clerics have <armor> of the 
<virtue> (Greaves of the Penitent, Chestplate of the Constant, etc.), 
Paladins have armor of Ro (quest is in Rathe Mtns), Shadowknights have 
Darkforge.  Totemic quests are in Lake Rathetear.

Man, haven't thought about those quests in a while. :)
