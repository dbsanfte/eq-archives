I have a level 14 blacksmith who became a master in the trade at level
12. My highest char is an 18 wiz that I don't even play much anymore.
I actually twink my HIGHER level chars when possible, but I do it by
selling the stuff I have worked long and hard to learn to make.

That said, even though I have earned everything my level 14 char is
wearing, people still call me a twink. I don't worry too much about
it. There are extreme twinks out there, and to each their own. I just
try to keep it within reason.  Well, okay, my 16 warrior DOES have a
Wurmy and Centi SS, but I DID earn every pp used to obtain them.  :)

Enjoy the game - there are so many ways to play it.
