Hmm, I think you miss my point.  In addition to being a slower, a
shaman is a healer.

Druid plus shaman is two healers in group

Cleric plus shaman is two healers in group

Brell, shaman plus shaman is two healers in group

Graeme isn't familiar with single healer groups, other than
single healer groups with only the one shaman in them.

Not that thats a bad thing, nor that a single healer who happens
to be a druid is a bad thing, per se... just commenting that it
might be pretty silly for him to expect two druids plus a shaman
as the healing section in a single group.
