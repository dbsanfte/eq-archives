You're assuming the loc is sent server side every time you move
even .00000000x of a loc. Given the constant patches to "reduce"
server/client chatter I would say this is a bad assumption.

Rather, the client has a big ol map of the zone and sends updates
to the server about where you're heading. The server says "Oh,
by the way, friendly porcupine_237 is at x,y" and your client looks
at its map and says "x,y is here, angry nasty hungry porcupine 237
goes right here" (ok, my client hates me and does stuff like that,
yours might not).

The client is controlling how everything is displayed to you. The
server is just saying "yep, that porcupines giving you a nice little
snuggle" while the client screams "a freaking insanely powerfull porcupine
bites YOU for 39842483 points of non-melee damage!"
