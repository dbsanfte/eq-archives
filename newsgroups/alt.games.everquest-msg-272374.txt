This isn't always the case.  For the Return of the Light quest in the
Commonlands you need to kill a named lion which is a rare spawn and
doesn't spawn automatically as you move into his section of the zone.
The next stage is to kill two named orcs which are also rare spawns.
(on an unrelated note I looked for those orcs for DAYS and when they
spawned they both popped at once and it turns out they were groupx2
encounters and I couldn't get anyone to help  grrrr)

I agree with Davian though, I have not had a quest that required a rare
drop off a rare spawn.  You can be required to get a rare mob or a rare
drop off a common mob but it doesn't look like you'll be asked for a
rare drop off a rare mob.
