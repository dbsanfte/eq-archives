One charge every 5 minutes?  ONE?  Oh come on now, thats even sillier than
the last version, where you could only use the effect once a minute.  I like
the change in general, but can't see why they made it 5 times longer than
their original proposed plan.

So now all mages will have access to this mission critical spell, but the
drop only spell will be massively better... makes sense to me.  Now if
they change the reuse time down to one minute, it will actually be
a contribution without being one that insanely ties up the time of
mages with the mass version.
