Where are the resists in your calculations?

If your puller is on the ball, and all the others are pulling their weight 
(and, since we are positing uber gear I will assume clueful players) then 
you should be fighting 90-100% of the time, with slight med/bio/whatever 
breaks.

>Enchanter, or bard - buff , mana regen , cc

Agreed on all these, but it's better to have a puller that is not the MT, 
since then the puller can keep a mob in queue(with help from the chanter) 
at all times. With that said, I prefer paly tanks over SK ones, as healing 
and LOH is much more helpful to a group than lifetaps HT and a dinky pet 
IMHO.

WTF are you on? Magicians kick ass for high DPS, but I doubt your placement 
of wizards ahead of rogues. Necro DPS is highly dependent on how fast you 
are killing mobs- when your DOT still has a minute to go when the mob drops 
you have just wasted mana. Shaman have *great* DPS- they haste monks and 
rogues :P
