Dan, question for you--based upon the fact that the same key gets used every
time by the account, and the username is sent unencrypted, would anyone even
bother with a dictionary program attack to find out what the password really
is?

I was thinking about it, and the only real purpose I can see for reversing out
the password they started with is if you plan on using it on other "secure"
sites they send to, as most people use the same PW over and over. I would
prefer the "record the encrypted key and use that" method, as it is so simple
that a scripter could almost pull it off it is so simple.

What do you think?

Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
