Ok, we can't even get a woman's discusion of looking at the joys of Legolas
vs Strider or Boromir going without you guys muscleing in!! It's a
discussion, at least I intended it to be so, of the gdamn movie and its
heart-throbs -- for *women*. Yah, feel free to add your discussion of the
Silmarrilion (sp??) to *another* thread, or start your own! This one is for
whatever women want to comment on about Legolas's legs or butt, or how
wonderfully blue Strider's eyes are, or how brave Boromir is!! Ok, I have to
admit, even though she isn't that much in the book, Liv Tyler's Arwen is
ferociously sexy, as is Galadriel (can't recall her name). But for ME, the
movie was eye candy, plain and simple, for women! I don't CARE if it didn't
follow the party line, I'm not *that* much of a Tolkien fanatic!!!!!!!! I do
care that I wanted to see it over and over again, for whatever reason.
Tonight I'm going with my cousin (who hasn't seen it at all!!) and Thursday
night I'm going with sister-in-law Jackie (that'll make 6 times), who's seen
it as many times as I have (though I'll be ahead of her by one if I see it
with cousin tomorrow night)... Guys, discuss The Matrix and The Silmarrilion
(which I couldn't *even* read) someplace else!! This thread is for women who
are turned on by Legolas and Strider and whoever!! ;)

thanks a bunch,
Darklet
