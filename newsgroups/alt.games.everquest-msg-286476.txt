OK, here's a plan.  Are shrouds rezable?  If you can lose exp in them, 
then they should be.  But this raises questions:

If you rez a dead shroud while the person is in shroud form, does he 
come back to his body in shroud form?

What if he's in normal form and you rez the dead shroud?

What if  you rez a normal body while the person is in shroud form?

Here's my thinking.  There are places, say for example the Crypt door in 
Sebelis, which require a rogue to pick a lock to get in.

Of course a possibility would be for someone in the group to shroud up 
as a rogue and you take them into the zone with you as such.

But what if instead you use some combination of rezzing and duel deaths 
to get them there in rogue form just long enough to pick the lock?

Say they shroud up, come with you to Seb, fight down with you to the 
locked door, open it and you slip inside.  Then  you duel them to a no 
exp loss death.  Back at the shroud person, they remove shroud, you rez 
them, and poof, you've got them back in normal form, but you're both 
inside the locked door without having to beg/hire a rogue to come open 
it for you.

Even if this doesn't work, there's a slightly more annoying option: 
Have them come in normal form, duel die, shroud up, return.  Get you 
past the door while you drag their body along.  They use Spirit Sending, 
remove the shroud, you rez them to their regular body, and you're back 
in business... but this requires them running down twice instead of just 
once, as would be possible depending on how rez and shroud/noshroud works.

Also possible, again depending on the answers, would be to have them die 
in normal form just in front of the door, shroud up, get rez, unlock the 
door, drag body inside, Spirit Sending, remove, and get second rez to 
body in normal form.  That would mean their real toon does everything 
but unlock that door.

Just woolgathering
