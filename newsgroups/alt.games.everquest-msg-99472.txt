Hunh? It seems to move to the same exact spot to me. There is only one
safe point in a zone and this lower level one, the self one and the
higher level one all move you to the safe point.

Yes the main thing is that just like dying or zoning, it reloads the
zone so no more aggro. I liked these much more when the zone did not
reload, but verant and players found out that due to some old game
design you HAVE to reload the zone to not still have aggro.. which is
also why you do it in the same zone when you die.
