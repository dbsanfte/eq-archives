Well, as long as the entire raid isn't 46, you generally won't have much
trouble going then.   Hate isn't all that hard.  Just need a good tank or two,
two or three competent enchanters and a few clerics.  (And it's generally not
hard to find clerics wanting to go to hate :P)

If you do have trouble, it'll probably be because something went horribly
wrong, in which case one person having an extra 5 levels won't mean a thing.
Perhaps even that every character on the entire raid having 5 more levels
won't mean anything.
