Be sure to keep this one trained along with sense heading, though it will 
eventually catch up in your 40s even with light use.  The best way I've 
found to train things such as this is to map them to my turn keys.  I'd 
probably map Forage to one turn key, and Sense Heading to another until 
you have Sense Heading maxxed for your level.  Then swap in Tracking for 
Sense Heading.  Having forage mapped there can get a bit annoying as I 
tend to forage stuff up immediately before I need to open a door ("Are 
you sure you want to drop your berries on the ground?"), but if you save 
your vegetables, morning dew and cinnamon sticks you'll find you won't be 
hurting for cash.  You'll find you can make an absolute killing selling 
those 3 items in the bazaar.

> Also I've been taunting everything I dare to so far

At this point there's not much reason to not taunt anything you aren't 
already fighting at close range (which should be everything you're 
fighting anyway, your damage output with a bow will be attrocious).  At 
the very low levels there's not much difference between you and a warrior 
as far as healing is concerned (unless the warrior is "twinked", wearing 
high level gear they could not have normally acquired).  If you're 
soloing (killing stuff on your own) you should be keeping taunt maxxed 
for sure.

More likely she meant cash to buy your spells :)  One of the nicest 
things about being a ranger (or any hybrid for that matter) is that our 
spells are pretty cheap for our level since we get them about 15-20 
levels after our "pure" caster counterparts, who end up broke every 4-5 
levels from buying theirs ;)  5pp should get you all your lvl 9 spells 
with change left over.  Casting skills are easy enough to raise, just get 
yourself a mana regen buff (enchanters over level 29 can cast "clarity", 
and nice ones will do it for free if you explain that you are working on 
raising your casting skills; just don't beg.  If they say "no" or you 
find yourself being ignored then don't press the issue).  Find yourself a 
corpse, and go to town.  Conjuration is one of the hardest to raise, so 
any time you find yourself bored at night (game time), start casting 
dance of fireflies or whatever that thing is called (think it's level 15, 
summons a light source).  Otherwise, you can pretty much just find a 
player's corpse and cast anything you want on it to get your skills 
raised.

> Now I can use my bow. 

You should only be using this to pull (do initial damage to a target in 
order to move it to your group for the kill).  Once you get into higher 
levels, you'll be able to do some serious damage with it, but for now 
you're better off just whacking on stuff after you've shot it with your 
bow once.  In your high 30s with a decent bow you can actually use it to 
kill things by snaring them and running backwards while shooting them 
full of arrows.  I did hill giants as they usually dropped enough pp to 
reimburse me for the cost of all the arrows I'd go through (usually 
around 150-200 per kill).

Two methods: 1) swim in circles, 2) swim into a corner.  Either way, just 
make sure you keep looking up while you do it and you'll never actually 
go under water for more than a split second.  Good places include the 
Shadowhaven pool and Ak'Anon, though any place with a decent sized pool 
of water and nothing that will try to eat you will work.

Been there, done both.
