Gotta wonder what the point of being in a guild like that is for someone 
like you. You can go and help them raid, but you aren't 'eligible' to be 
rewarded. Really, they might as well just kick you out, probably do you 
both a favour, since you could join a guild where you are appreciated.

Don't mind me, I'm sure you've got your reasons. But some of the guild 
loot systems are so screwed up its sad. You can almost tell how anally 
retentive a guild is by its loot system.
