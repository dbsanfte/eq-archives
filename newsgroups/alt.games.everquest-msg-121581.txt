There are 3 places you can get the bark.
Its ground spawn in BB, so shout to buy it when you run through. Can try 
to find it, but damn hard to find.

Then its foraged in Kith. Theres only Oak Bark and some radish as 
special foraged in that zone, so fairly good chance of getting it.

And then theres WW. Someplace around 6-8 special items on the forage 
list, so its a LOT rarer than in Kits. Might be worth if if you are 
there to XP, but if you wanna get oak bark fast, go to Kith.
