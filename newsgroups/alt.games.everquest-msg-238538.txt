As others have mentioned, the plat can be sold for more, but
even if I had no way to sell it I'd prefer to have it, since
I could get more than $100 worth of fun out of it.

On the other hand, it might depend on some details you didn't
mention.  If someone just GAVE me one or the other, I'd prefer
the $100, because if I were given the plat I'd feel bad about
spending it.  I.e., none of my characters have any way to come
by that sort of money, and I know that it's been exhilarating
each time I've reached a new threshhold of plat and was able
to finally buy something I've had my eye on.  If I could just
look around the Bazaar and buy the uber-est of gear, I'd feel
bad, knowing that I hadn't earned it.

Getting $100 for nothing somehow doesn't feel like as big a
deal.  But that may be getting back to the fact that $100 isn't
worth as much as the plat.

But if you're asking, would I rather be in a situation where
I've got the plat and feel that I deserved it, vs the $100,
I'd definitely love to have the plat.
