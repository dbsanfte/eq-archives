That would mean they would have even LESS time to rez than those who
camped to desktop, right? If I understand correctly, your corpse lasts
longer if you are completely logged off.  According to the posts, the
person who was unable to get the rez was the person who did NOT log in
periodically to check her corpse.

If I'm correct on these points, it is interesting indeed. I will
surely /camp the hard way when on a CR from now on.
