I guess the only thing to stop that is the people at Sigil.  Here's
the way I see it.

They left because they couldn't do what they wanted at SOE.

They formed Sigil and got backing to do what they wanted.

For whatever reason it seems to not be working out with MS so they are
going the extra step of actually purchasing the rights back from MS,
so Sigil would own the game outright.

They don;t want to waste time and resources on things not related to
the game directly (read distribution, marketing, etc.) so they partner
with someone who already has those resources.

It seems to me from the above that it's unlikely SOE would "take over"
Vanguard but, even if it eventually did, how much fun is the game
until such time?

And remember, SOE is not getting the cut of this that they got on EQ
or EQ2.  They are essentially a distributor, that's a far cry from
"partner" and even further from "owner".

So if in a year SOE somehow ruins Vanguard you can cancel.  But until
such time why deprive yourself of a potentially awesome game just
because of the affiliation?  I prefer the hedonisitic approach
personally.
