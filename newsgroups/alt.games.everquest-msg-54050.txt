At level 32 I left Highkeep, and tried a few places before stopping at Lower
Guk.  If the hallway spawn is broken near the zone you can nearly solo here
(definitely should be able to by 35).  Otherwise the Bedroom group is OK.
The great thing about LGuk is it is an undead dungeon.  You just got a new
Undead DD spell at 30, you have invis to undead (which gives you a huge
advantage), plus if you've got Ghoulbane, then this place rocks once you get
to know it.  You can easily stay here until 45+ (although I moved on at 39).

Be prepared to die here, trains are frequent, but I found it was worth it,
as the exp far outweighed the cost of dying.  I found too that on my server
there were often a lot of high level clerics there that would often exp rez
you.  Drawbacks apart from the trains etc. are being used to Highkeep you
have to get used to Freeport being your closest binding and banking point,
and Oasis your closest merchants.  A map I found realy helps with getting to
know LGuk too.  Oh, and at least on my server the grouping in LGuk wasn't as
organised at Highkeep.  But while I was there I sorta tried to enforce a few
principles :-).

A lot of higher levels also say that LGuk is one of the best places for
mid-level players to learn tactics of high level dungeons.

But I would try a few of the places that people have suggested, and find
which works best for you.
