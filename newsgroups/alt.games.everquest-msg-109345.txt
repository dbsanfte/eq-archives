add some creatures to the game which immediatly attack anyone who
feigns death? There are animals who feed of the dead like vultures and
such but dont attack living things. Why not some innocuous carrion
beetles who wander around and when a monk tries to FD around them they
think hes dead and rush over to eat him. hehehe.....i think some
giants in Kael like to eat dead flesh too. At least that would keep
the idiot monks who make a bad pull with tons of adds and take them
all the way back to the group before they FD and wipe the group out
then stand up and say "Sorry".....then promptly do it again.
