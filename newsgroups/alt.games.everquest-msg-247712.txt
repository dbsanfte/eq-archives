Not really.  In the part you snipped they defined group in this instance 
to mean ONE or more people.  It's worth noting that these rules also 
include absolutely nothing about them being mobs you get XP from or not.

You couldn't claim the camp on grounds of being there first.  They 
couldn't claim the camp on grounds of you not getting XP from it.  The 
proper way to deal with this, according to the rules, would be to share.

What you -did-, though, was killstealing.  Damaging a mob more than 50% 
that they had already engaged.  That is entirely against the rules.  If 
you wanted to drive them off without breaking the rules, you'd have to 
play the stupid annoying twitch game of making sure you aggro every mob as 
it pops before they did, and keep the entire camp dead at all times.

But sharing would be vastly preferred.  As others pointed out, you 
could've grouped your lowbie with them or Pled them.
