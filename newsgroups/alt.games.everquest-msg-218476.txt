How about the fact that you keep moving through the dungeon in LDoN, not
sit in one spot killing the same mobs over and over for shards. I
personally find that the most significant improvement in LDoN. No more
groups staking our thier little piece of dungeon turf and fighting with
their neighbours over the mobs on the border with the next camp down the
line.
