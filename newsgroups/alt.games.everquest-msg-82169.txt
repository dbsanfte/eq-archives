Hardly anyone reads?  You mean like the 100 million native speakers of
French or the 70 million native speakers of German?  Let's not even go
into the 1 Billion speakers of various dialects of Chinese.

Generally, when I come across a posting a in foreign language that I
read, I'll respond in that language via email.

Once in a while, I've posted a response in that language to the ng,
and receive a very courteous note via email in response.

English speakers are a microcosm of the vast ocean of humanity.
