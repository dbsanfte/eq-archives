Reading Rumble's musings on his recent issues with a new guild and, having
been looking for a decent guild as well, I had the (IMNSHO) idea that we
should start an AGE guild on one of the servers (FV being my choice).
Membership requirements would be simple, be an active poster (no trolls (as
in internet trolls) need apply) and the ever present kindness to others in
guild and do nothing to bring shame upon our name.  I'm not authoritarian
enough in my game style to lead such a group.

Would there be interest?  Would there be any reason to do it or not?
