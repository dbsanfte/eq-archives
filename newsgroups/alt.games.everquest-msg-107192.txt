Ya just dont get it. No class envy here at all . While I have a 60 druid ,I
have given up on him ever being usefull. I perceive a imbalance , I am not
particularly annoyed by it though. My chanter and monk are more than enough
to keep me satisfied and they are both usefull in all situations. The druid
is not.

And yeah clerics are the easiest class to play. They gain an exp giving
group basically just for the asking. They gain a good guild by just not
being a complete fuck up. They have such an easy time getting to 60 that it
is not at all uncomon to find them completely clueless at 60. I do believe
the class envy is all on the other side of the argument. Oh look at him solo
sounds good and all but druids arent particularly good soloers.

Clerics scream bloody murder every time we mention that 15 classes require 3
real healing classes. They do this precisely because they dont want to
compete on anything even close to a level playing field. They scream loud
and hard but we can only heal! Its the only thing we do !

Of course while so screaming they are of course ignoring.
1)they will always be the best healers no matter how far they improve druids
and shamans.
2) they are the only pure caster that wears plate armor.
3) they have the most usefull and widest ranging invulnerability spells.
4) there nukes that everyone laughs at are damn close in both effeciency and
power to a druids. I.e for the same mana for a little extra time they can do
very close to the same amount of dammage.
5) they have a mem blur spell.
6) they are and always will be the best ressers in the game a critical
function that everyone eventually needs.
7) they have all the fear and all the root spells.
8) while they dont have invis they have invis undead and only wizards
overlap both.

clerics argue a good game but the facts just dont support them . If you want
to really be annoyed go watch one soloing sometime , they can do it and
without all that much effort. The reason they dont is the same reason my
chanter dosent bother to often , there is no need. When you can get a group
almost anywhere just for the asking with a better exp rate and the chance of
loot there is very little incentive to solo. The fact you see so many druids
soloing is evidence that they suck not the other way around. Everyone can
solo .
