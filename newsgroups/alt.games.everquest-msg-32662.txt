Orlun 5 minutes after you logged again last night in Sro, the AC popped. I
was gonna get the ring, but some KSd me! I had it kited and he KSd me
anyway! He was member of Azure Legion and I posted onto their site, the
following is what i said.

Heading: You're guild member Mercurinor Kill Stole our AC!!

Body:

My name is Dominikus, 41 Ranger of Bearers of Fate. Yes i'm a ranger, but
that's not the point.

My guildmate Orlun a rogue in our guild and I was camping the AC in Sro for
3 hours, killing all the supposed triggers in the desert to pop the AC, low
and behold it pops right next to me by DEF merchants. I snare/root/DOt it
and someone shouts AC by DEF merch and I /ooc that I'm on it.

I had him Snared/Rooted/dotted. I can't tank it straight on so I usually
wait till a giant is 50% from kiting until I engage for melee to finish it
off.

Your guild mate Mercurinor lvl 45 Warrior runs up to me, looks at me while
im sittin to med while AC is dotted and proceeds to attack the AC, i said i
had it to plz stop KSing me. He just kills it, Loots it, and Gates to
Thurgadin.

I /ooc and flamed him, i /shout and flamed him.

He says he engaged it with full health, well duh, i JUST Dotted him, was he
not curious y the cyclops was just standing there next to me and not running
to attack? He was ROOTED. Then in /ooc after i said plz don't KS it, he says
/ooc I never said i wasn't! lol...

I said, but you even went up to me and saw me there, and he said yeah I saw
you! you were sitting! WTF does he not know kiting? you snare/root/dot Sit.

WTF is that supposed to mean? So its ok for him to KS? I sent tell and he
says it happens buddy. So am i supposed to follow his example? So i can just
run around and KS everyone and use the excuse.. Hey it happens buddy, send
Mercurinor a tell, he told me it happens!. WTF!!!!

Yes KS happens, but its ppl like Mercurinor that makes KSing happen. I
understand accidental KS but that was deliberate! I hope the rest of your
guild does not uphold his ideals because if so, I feel horrible about the
guild. I always though Azure Legion was honorable.

Orlun spins around and falls flat on his face...splat (sigh)

*****

oh well... one question, I know sro is a no-camp-ac zone and anyone is free
to engage the AC.  Is Kill Stealing allowed as well? your thoughts?
