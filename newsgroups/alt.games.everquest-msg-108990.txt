You're getting two very different arguments tangled up here.

Argument 1 - A player who deliberately screws over another player is a
jerk. He's a jerk in the game, and by impacting the enjoyment of
another player, he's a jerk in real life. A jerk is a jerk, but being
a jerk is a much different thing than being "evil". The world is full
of people who are jerks from time to time, but very few of them eat
babies.

Argument 2 - A player of a "good" race who kills other good races is
neither a jerk (necessarily) nor evil. He is playing the game, within
the ruleset provided by the game, and he 'pays' for his actions within
the game in terms of the rewards and punishments (faction, etc.) that
game imposes. But all of this happens *in the game*, and is therefore
entirely fictional, just roleplaying. It says *nothing whatsoever*
about what that person is in real life.

Now, if you want to run with either, or both, of those arguments, by
all means do so. I'd love to see what you come up with. Just be clear
about which you're arguing at any given time, please.
