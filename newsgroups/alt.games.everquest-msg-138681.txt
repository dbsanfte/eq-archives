Many of these topics stem from a different point of view or way of looking
at thing.  Where you choose to focus your thoughts so to speak.  My wife
likes to receive and send chain mails from her friends.  I've read a few
(most of the time just deletee them).  It may have been something as simple
as taking a question off an enrollment application that spools some people
up.  Like the old "Telephone Game," where you pass information by mouth
across the room to find out if the details remain the same, the message
changes completely.  I can imagine, though I don't have any facts, that to
be more politacally correct and avoid critisism and loss of contributers/tax
benefits and organization may remove some bias questions off their
enrollment applications.  Churches or other extremist groups may see this
omition as an open invitation and spread the message that an organization
suddenly became a WHATEVER supporting organization.  Then these groups post
messages to that effect and stories get added and deleted.

My favorite example was a message a supervisor sent to me concerning Jane
Fonda.  It was alarming and so I looked further into it only to find lies
and exagerations.  True she made some bad judgements and accusations, but
the story of the captive servicemen handing her slips of paper and her
turning them in was entirely FALSE...  Fabricated along the way by
imaginative grievous parties against her.  I agree, I don't like her actions
at the time, but there is no need to lie.  The TRUTH was sufficient.
Perhaps this "policy" is true... in a sense, but I believe without seeing
things in black and white (on official company letterhead) it is a waste of
time putting stock in these posts.  Lets get back to EVERQUEST please!!!

Can I get a Clarity???
