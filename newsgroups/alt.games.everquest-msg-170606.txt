If it's taken as an insult, it's only because the ideas that are attached to
it are insulting.  Of course, I think you've clearly expressed that you
don't agree with the ideas the public liberals attach to the word.  Hmm,
maybe liberals like you need a new label, just like conservatives like me.

If not "no mind of my own," then you very well suggest that I am being led
by Rush.

I've done so, but I tend to do much more balanced research if I have the
time.  Usually, it's by gut instinct and plain ol' common sense if I don't
have the time to delve very deep.

Yet you don't say who does.

Ok, where does a leftist differ from a liberal in your book?  This may be
the pivot point of our difference.

I may have to steal that line about Farrakhan.

Conservatives have our share of those, as well.  They're what Limbaugh (hah,
I saw you twitch involuntarily) refers to as Republicans in Name Only.
Think Jim Jeffords, Lincoln Chafee, or John McCain.

I've noticed people tend to cluster around their campfires.  This only makes
sense, since certain core beliefs lead to similar viewpoints on many issues.
Those who are religious and believe in small government tend towards the
conservative and libertarian views.  Those who are big government and
religious will tend towards the "religious right" or the
"give-away-the-store left."  Atheism and Big government types will tend
towards the collectivist or fascist parties.  And Athiest with a small
government view will lean towards libertarianism.  Granted, the detais may
shift, but there are definate groupings.

As far as a speaker goes, it makes things easier for expressing your views.
If I can point at someone in the media who shares my views, then someone who
is familiar with that person would be able to get a quick "at a glance" idea
of what I believe.  Doesn't mean I believe everything they do, just that we
tend to agree.

Up to here, this sounds like the conservative stance.

Claify please.

The founding fathers obviously agreed with you.  Notice, though, that the
intent was not to completely separate religion and politics.  Politics will
always be influenced by the religous beliefs of the practitioners.

I'm not sure how conservative radio talk-show hosts qualify as "thought
police."

I think you said somewhere that capitalism was based on the concept that
greed is good, and that it is unchristian because of it.  However, I've
completely lost track of that part of the thread.

Bah, rest of thread snipped partly out of sheer exhaustion, and partly due
to the fact that I've completely lost track of where we were going and where
we came from....
