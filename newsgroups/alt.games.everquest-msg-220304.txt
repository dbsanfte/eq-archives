In the last week or so I saw a posting in this newsgroup (which
unfortunately I can't find) suggesting that it's easy to tell when a
warrior has taunted a mezzed mob off the enchanter.  He simply taunts,
assists the mob, and sees who the target is.

As someone who has a 50s enchanter and a 30s warrior I was pretty
interested in this.  I happened to think of it last nite as my
enchanter was sitting, watching our tank prepare to break mez.  So I
targetted our tank, assisted him to the mob, assisted back to the
tank.  Just to check, I went thru it again.

Tank broke mez, mob ran across the room and banged on me.  It doesn't
work.

I can think of two reasons why it might not of worked, one of which I
could fix and one of which I can't:

1) While the mob was mezzed (and LONG before the tank started
taunting) I tashed and slowed it.  If that continues to generate hate
like a DOT, perhaps the warrior was at the top of the list, but I
popped to the top as mez was broken.

2) Since the mob couldn't move while mezzed, the only thing it can hit
is the warrior.  Just as a rooted mob will hit someone next to it, but
sometimes run across the floor when root breaks, perhaps I was still
at the top of the hate list.  If this is the problem, then the assist
trick just doesn't work.

Anyone have any idea as to what's going on?
