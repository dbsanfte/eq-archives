*Chuckle* Tell me about it. I don't drink, so why would I got to a bar
anyway? All you meet there are barflies for the most part anyway.
Personal ads/dating services are full of self-gratifying egotists
("Sex god(des) looking for a real man!" No, seriously, that was the
title of one ad. And many like it.). I wouldn't mind the long-distance
thing if I could travel - I did it once.

*shrug* I don't live anywhere near Houston, though. Every female I've
met here who plays EQ has been snagged up by the other geeks, and we
geeks don't let go of the rare female gamers too easy. ;-)

If you did know who Avenger was, and assuming you are indeed not him,
you'd be highly insulted...
