Thanks for the advise on the Radion, however I'm interested in the Radion
All-N-Wonder 32MB (DDR) card.  I'd be getting it mostly for the TV IN
ability, I don't use TV out that much, only when running a video or
something and duplicating viewing space to another screen to make it easier
for others to watch (or like when I go to someone's house with their 46"
TV).
    Also tech question.  My motherboard doesn't support DDR RAM (no slots
for it).  Does the DDR RAM on the video card have anything to do with this?
Can I still get DDR video card RAM and use SDRAM for my PC (motherboard)?
    Anybody know of a good cheap (but GOOD to work with) site to buy from?
I'm hoping to pay under $170 as the lower ones on PriceWatch are in the $160
range for 32MB DDR All-n-Wonder Radion.
