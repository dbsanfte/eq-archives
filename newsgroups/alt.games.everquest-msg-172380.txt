I did try a cursory test with a guildy cleric last night. She was down
to about 20% mana and I started singing amp/mana song without twisting
the mana song with itself. When she got to 60%, I started power
twisting (amp/mana song x8) until she was FoM. She then immediately
cast a heal on me. She said that it *did* seem to take a good bit more
mana to cast than she was used to.

This was just a quick test performed when the situation allowed it. I
have a low level ranger I intend to do some more testing with.
