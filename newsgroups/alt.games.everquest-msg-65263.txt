Ummm, Im on a 56k modem, with an ISP that times out after 2 hours...I woke
up in the morning set the download going and got a time of 1hr 30mins to
go come up.....came back to the machine and it had got everything within
one 2hr block.

I think if they had done a mail CD option they'd have choked their mail
room it very labour intensive to match payment to addy and send out (plus
Europe at this time is a real stretch). PLus there would have been so much
slagging for 'they want us to pay for a patch' it would have been
untrue...

The same thing happens everytime the servers come back up....everyone
tries desperately to squeeze the last minute of play out....wait a bit and
it saves a lot of aggro etc....not to mention I still cant yet get Luclin
itself as Im euro.....
