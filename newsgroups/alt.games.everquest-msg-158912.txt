True, but it usually takes activities more extreme and widespread
than the one the original poster was bleating about.

In any case, protesting because an industrial operation "might"
eradicate a species without knowing about it would be a (silly)
argument for halting just about every human activity on the face
of the Earth.

"Don't walk through that field, you might accidentally step on
the last remaining female of an unknown species and not even
know it!!!!"

I'll be glad to help put the brakes on something if it can
actually be shown that it has a chance to cause the extinction
of species X, but the original post had nothing better to offer
than unsupported claims of the possible extinction of unnamed
species, and wanted me to "support the cause" and try to halt
a mining operation based on nothing more than that.  Color me
unimpressed.

No, I'm sad that you missed a classic example of knee-jerk
empty-headed environmentalist anti-industrial hand-wringing.
It was quite entertaining.

(Did I exceed my hyphen quota in that last paragraph?)
