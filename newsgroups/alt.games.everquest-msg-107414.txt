At least you did report her.  There may not be evidence of her guilt,
but there is a record of people complaining about her.  Enough
complaints will make a difference.  

My opinion is that when she does do something to get caught, they'll
consider the complaints when handing out punishment.  So she'll have to
start being extra good because one 'caught red handed' along with the
complaints could make the difference between suspended and banned.
