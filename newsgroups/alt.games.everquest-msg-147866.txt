    Yes. So as long as they're grouped, and in the same zone, this can
happen. Proximity is not an issue. We do this in The Deep all the time -

someone at zone-in, corpse is summoned to raid, person is ressed to raid.

    Except that it's long, and tedious, and expensive (one stackable coffin
and one peridot per person, vs. one pearl and maybe one peridot).
