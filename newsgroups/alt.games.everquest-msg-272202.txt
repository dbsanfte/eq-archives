There are quite a few.

Every creature Mastery quest (skeleton, zombie, etc) gives something
to hang on the wall.  A lot of the book quests (architecture of
Vermin's Snye for example) give a book as areward (but since these
books are often worth 50s or more each, I usually selll them).

There's a quest in South Qeynos where a woman wants a sketch of the
sword monument in NQ, and she gives an easel as a reward.

Others give small things like tables, etc.

So far, my crafted stuff is better, to be honest.
