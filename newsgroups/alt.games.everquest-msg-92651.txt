Actually I do not think you realise exactly how wasted the paragraph was: In
a public forum you get to choose who you listen to, not who speaks. And who
gives a fuck in what you are interested in or not? There is only one "Dan
Harmon" in "Public Forum" and thousands of other peoples so your interests
(and mine) are of little concern.

Have a nice day.
