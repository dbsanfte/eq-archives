Because your computer doesn't cut it. Turn all new models off, reduce 
the texture quality to the minimum, and bring the clipping plane right 
up to your nose, and you will just about be able to run acceptably in 
the old world and in Velious. You will need a bigger rig if you want to 
play in Luclin or PoP, and in most of Kunark. If you absolutely can't 
afford a new computer, at least add more memory (256MB minimum) and a 
new videocard if you can.

No, you can't, but the new UI isn't slowing you down significantly.
