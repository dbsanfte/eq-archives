Ok, I worded it poorly.  Succesful was a bad choice.  Not sure what a good 
choice is though.  Oh well.  I'm tiring of the whole discussion anyway.

Our guild had been stuck doing Kael since shortly after the release of 
velious.  Yeah, we'd been stuck on that for a year.  I didn't consider 
that successful.  We should have been in TOV as a guild no less than 8 
months ago given how much most of us play.

So I guess I can only define success in terms of what we were not 
achieving.
