See Silent Scream's leveling progress report thread. Level 26 in 3 1/2
weeks. Disgusting. I guess if you have the time and devote yourself to
powerleveling it can be done.

If you're still in faydark at level 4 hang out by the newbie lift. There's a
circle of stones not too far away where there is a low level mob respawn
area. Lot's of folks hunting them but when I was there, plenty of mobs to go
around. You can't get too lost if you pay attention to and stay between the
landmarks: path, big hill, small gorge, and stone ring. Wandering over to
orc hill at your level is certain death.
