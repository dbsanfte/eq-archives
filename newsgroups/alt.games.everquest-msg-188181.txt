Two races I dont see are Frog and Ogre - I onl see one race/class you
havent done in frog and thats Frog Paladin - as you say you have cleric
and Warrior readily accessible then you are sorta stuck - though they seem
to have some specific spells these days dont they and a lot of reasonable
quests for themselves.

Ogre BST is the only class race combo there thats sensible and IIRC you
said that that was also a class that fell foul of the above 'i've already
got the extremes'. Having played BST and SHM and MNK to some small degree
I'd have to say my impression of them (to about lvl 20) was that of the
hybrids the BST was the one that stood out against its extremes as being
very different - I tried pally and hated it, I tried SK and deleted it - I
have a ranger but there seems enough ranger stuff to keep me interested
(and my ranger may have contributed to not liking the other hybrids as I
already was playing at that boundary). Still liked BST with the pet stuff
an all....
