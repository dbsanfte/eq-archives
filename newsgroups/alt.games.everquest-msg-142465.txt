Easy. There are two sides to theft: Enjoying something that's not yours, 
and depriving someone else of that enjoyment. I submit that there is a 
difference between carjacking a Ferrari owner and leaving them curled up 
and shivering on the side of the highway, and zapping a Ferrari from a 
distance with your magical molecular electro-duplicator and driving away 
with a perfect copy of that Ferrari.

You may say, "But Ferrari never got your money!", true enough, but since 
I could never afford a Ferrari, they aren't worse off in any way (except 
perhaps in the sense that Ferraris are now less exclusive, but since 
this is an intentionally unrealistic example, I won't go into that :).

What I mean by this is, the mechanics of any industry that deals in 
copies, be it Music, Books or whatever, will have to adapt to the fact 
that copies *will* be distributed, and find new revenue models, be it 
voluntary contributions, subscription models (it's working great for EQ) 
or whatever. I'm not defending piracy in any way (as I said, piracy 
threatens my own livelihood), I'm just trying to be pragmatic about it.
