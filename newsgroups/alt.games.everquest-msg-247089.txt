Given that the first CoH post I noticed here was from Monual, and shoot, I 
enjoy his bridge stories, you're right, CoH is getting a lot more slack 
from me.  It helps that I may actually be interested enough in CoH to try 
it.

Personally, I don't mind the occasional one-post thread advertising some 
other game that I may well be interested in.  I particularly thank Annie 
for posting about kingdomofloathing.com, that was a really good one.  I do 
wish the WoW posts would take a hike, though, so yes, I am entirely 
selective in my biases. :) The group as a whole seems to have the most 
animosity for playerauctions-like spam, and that I agree with, fair or 
not.

Hmm. I thought I had a point when I started this post, but now I can't 
seem to find it.  Darn. :)
