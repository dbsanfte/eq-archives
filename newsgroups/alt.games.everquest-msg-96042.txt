My guild requires a member registration on our website.  Main character
info, e-mail is requested, but not required (officers are the exception),
member roster is a must.  We don't have a bank for members to draw from and
won't.  However, we are on the lookout for items for other guild members (I
have a certain Bard that I owe a few thank you items to...) but that doesn't
mean farming stuff.

Policies?

we go by the PnP Verant has instituted, as well as, no cursing, d00d sp3ak,
dishonorable actions, mature behavior, no insulting, spamming, etc,
potential memebers MUST fill out an application and have grouped with a few
members of the guild, whereby the app is put to a vote, pretty standard
stuff.


activities?  we plan low level, midlevel and soon to be high level raids.
EVERYONE is included.  cliques are nonexistent.  I can proudly say that I
have grouped with about 85% of my guild, and those I haven't, I simply can't
from a level perspective, but I have met each member face to face.

check out a few of the guild websites and see what they're doing.
www.guildmagic.com and www.guildworld.com have a few guilds that will give
you a good idea.
