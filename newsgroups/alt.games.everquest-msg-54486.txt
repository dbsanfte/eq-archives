    Most of that has to do with the stupidly sporadic appearances of the
only person that can do anything about most requests, the head GM. Requests
also seem to drop once you've logged, which really doesn't help matters. It
would be nice if there was a "checked, player had logged, this would be an
ongoing concern" queue that the GMs could check through if the petition
queue ever cleared out and they had time. At least then you wouldn't need to
re-petition over and over.

    My server's GMs have always been about as lenient as possible. My one
name experience was getting the name of a
corpse-dragging-mule-turned-serious-character changed, and it was done with
very little hassle. In the near future I'll be applying to have the surname
"Sprockett" for my tiny mage, Sprickett, as the filter keeps rejecting it.
I'll be sure to report how that goes.

    James
