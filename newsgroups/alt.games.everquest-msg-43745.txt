Hmm....  considering the cones down there can see inviz and my body sat next
to a few spawns, I just had to keep /corpse it and die, keep trying, die....
until my body and agro range was far away enough to have my druid that I was
with port me out...  yesh, I wasn't dying because I didn't GET THE CLUE, I
was dying to save my equipment and learn a lesson.
