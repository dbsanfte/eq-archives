I'm going to scan my logs and post exact numbers here in a post of
its own in a day or two, but my Dwarf Paladin got non-KoS to the
LegionOfCabilis (Troopers) after about 1700 sarnaks/goblins
(mostly goblins), and was able to bank (and be non-KoS to the
Crusaders and monks) after around 7700 bone chips (1925 quest
completions).

The shamans still hate me, though, but they're easy to easy
avoid.  And of course the necros hate my guts, since I'd have
to kill about 2000 outcast Iksar to have even a chance of
being non-KoS to them (they're not affected by the bone chip
quest).  This means that I can go anywhere in both East and
West Cabilis, except for near the Shaman guild, the Necro,
guild, the house where the Furscales hang out (they're on
shaman faction), Crusader Quarg in Field of Bone (despite
being called a Crusader he's actually on the shaman faction
group).  And I can use all vendors/bankers except for the
few that are on necro/shaman faction (they just tell me to
buzz off -- vendors are never KoS).

And boy, do I get some funny looks from the Iksar players
in Cabilis.
