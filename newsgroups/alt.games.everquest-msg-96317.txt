Nah, no offense of course.  You seem to have this attitude I did in my
latter days of playing UO when they actually started 'dumbing-down' the game
to increase sales/revenue/subscriptions.  Alot of the things us veterans had
struggled with for years were suddenly being handed to newer players.

I think what you're feeling is an interesting dynamic I like to call
'oldtimers syndrome'.  Buckle your seatbelt too, I think as more games
arrive to compete with EQ, it will get 'dumber' as time goes by.  This
certainly is a far cry from the EQ I started back in '99.

The other threads commenting on a post from the safehouse indicating that
hell levels will be gone doesn't really suprise me at all, and doesn't seem
at all a stretch for a company that's in the money-making side of online
gaming.
