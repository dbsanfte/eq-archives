Group HP is updated more frequently than other HP at a distance, but
it does get less frequent if you get far away from one another (dunno
about pets, presume it works same as group members).  But what I was
referring to is the relatively recent (since the new UI perhaps?)
phenomenon of update lags for very near targets, most definitely
including yourself.  I have not been a group healer recently, so I
have not investigated this in detail, but it appears that all HP

display updates are now delayed until the next "tick", i.e. the delay

can be up to 5.9 seconds late.  This includes both the numerical
values on the inventory screen and the bar graphs.  For example, if
I cast a heal (or buff with +hp component) on myself I will see my
HP updated several seconds after I complete casting.  Another example,
in a group in Old Sebilis the L59 Ogre Warrior who was our MT went
from (apparently) over half health to dead in a single nuke.  I had
around 3.7khp with the buffs we had, so there's no way he had under
4khp, and there is no nuke that froggie wiz could cast that could do
that much damage, but the 2 big nukes that he landed did the trick
nicely, we just didn't know the MT was hurt by the first one until
the second one landed several seconds later and killed him.  I was
standing shoulder to shoulder, without the HP update lag I would have
used LH for 2300hp heal and the MT lives, personally I think it's
really fucking stupid that he died to what is apparently an arbitrary
change to the communication between the server and the client.  I
also think it sucks that LH is a great deal less useful the way the
game plays now.
