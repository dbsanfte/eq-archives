DA and move him deeper round the corner (opposite side to jumpy) - the first
AE shouldn't hit anybody now

Give your warrior like 1-2 seconds headstart on the rest of the raid if
needed - if he has snare glands, AE taunt , whatever - he will be able to
instantly turn agro on himself.. but don't give him 20-30 seconds like an
average mob

Melees should all offensive disc within 10 seconds.   Casters can still be
hidden at this point, as soon as melees go all offensive, burn trak down (ie
chain nuke and fry his ass)
