    Yes, yes it was.  Too bad this was your best form of recourse.  And
I trust that you do keep a "never group with this jerk" again list?  If
his whole guild has the attitude you describe I might just use their tag
as a warning sign.

   The funniest part to me is imagining the whining sob story he
probably did present his guild with. /snicker.
