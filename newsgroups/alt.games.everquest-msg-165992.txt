Methinks you have a problem with the adjective vastly.

adj. vast�er, vast�est
  1.. Very great in size, number, amount, or quantity.
  2.. Very great in area or extent; immense.
  3.. Very great in degree or intensity
It is not my contention that monks do not outdammage warriors . It is my
contention that they outdammage them by so little to not nearly overcome the
advantages warriors have as a pure melee class.

similiar sets of weapons would be for instance.
warriors ( 10 18 ) monk (13 21)
warriors ( 16 19 ) monk (18 20 )
warriors ( 50 44 2h) monk (43 30 2h)
though if you want to use the primal examples of 12 20 warriors vs 15 20
monks feel free .

If I was to make a chart for dammage and tanking ability it would look sorta
like this.

class                tanking           dammage
warrior               10                   5
rogue                   5                    10
monk pre nerf      8                     7
monk after nerf    6                     7

The monk class should have a ratings of 8 and 8. Then they would have
something special about themselves i.e the best balance of attack and
defense.

The fact that all the names are screwed up to hell and gone is beside the
point though it really annoys warriors ( which name should really go to the
class with the best balance in attack and offense) Should have beserkers
instead of rogues (which name should go to a semi) . And knights should be
the tank choice :p . Oh and they screwed up the monk name too since monks
where always rumoured to have magical powers (should be a semi)
