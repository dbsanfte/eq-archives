Maybe he was hogging them, but that doesn't make him a fucktard.   If he was
training, ksing etc.. then fair enough, but those mobs are open to
everybody.. not just druids (or just you)

When I was in my AA leveling prime, me and a guildie 60 rogue would setup
camp at 'cps' (a camp and name we made up heh).. with the 2 of us (and one
of us botting our 60 cleric), we would time the spider pops (nobody can beat
you to a pull when you know exactly when its set to pop)..

we didn't need crowd control, add's were no problem.. so we would pull more
before our mob died (with both our clerics logged in, we once handled 12
spiders in 1 pull).. we could even handle some of the small castle trains
heh

And sure, we were damn greedy at the time, but I also remember the times I
would run around velks for 30minutes at a time, just trying to find a mob to
kill.. and we would never steal mobs already pulled, or mobs "inside" a camp
(e.g spiders from the back or left wall, if a group was inside), even tho
when I solo people happily pulled directly from my camp..

> Monks aren't the only morons in CS though,

Nope, druids are too.  Are so are wizards.  Hmm, necros too.  Wait, we
seeing a pattern here?  Its got squat to do with the class, its down to the
person and how they chose to play.

And calling him a moron/fucktard cuz he beats you to spawns, merely makes
you sound like a jealous whiney lil bitch :)
