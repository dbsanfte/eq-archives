I've answered it several times; perhaps your server isn't showing the posts
yet?

I do not expect the community to "play guard" for me.  If I don't ask for
help, I don't expect it.  If the character is of indeterminate level or
possibly AFK, I don't expect it even if I ask.  But when the person is
hunting the same thing I am, stops at my yells, turns, comes over and
watches me for a good 20 seconds without doing anything--he had a pet
up--then I consider that quite rude, too.

I've had the same experiences, by the way, which is why I hesitate to even
debuff mobs or land a 5-damage mini-nuke for faction or something.  So if I
hadn't asked for help, I honestly would've shrugged it off and figured, "At
least the work wasn't for nothing, he got some good kills."

Again, it's not that I died in front of someone.  That happens plenty in EQ.
It's that they clearly heard me, turned, watched me at length, ignored
further requests, and chose not to help when they capable of it.  (If they
weren't, they wouldn't have been where they were.)  They would've gotten an
easy kill if they'd helped; instead, they waited on me to drop/get gate off
and were left with two easier kills.
