No.

The Sceptre is turned in to Omsaat (forget his name, something like that) to
get the second orb.  This causes Natasha to spawn nearby.  You give her the
singed scroll, and she then gives you the (no-drop) pearl you need to
continue with the quest for the third orb.

I can't imagine what it must have been like the first time someone did this
quest, for it's only after turning in the Sceptre that any mention of the
Overking is made.  So someone turned in the sceptre, found out they needed a
drop from the Overking in Chardok, got the scroll... then found that Natasha
had long since despawned.  So they would have had to repeat the entire first
two-thirds of the quest just to get Natasha up again.

Ugh.  Spoilers are good sometimes.
