>>If a character kills an NPC and that NPC does not give them experience,
then the Trivial Loot Code takes effect.<<

I know TLC is a touchy subject here, but just wanted to share my experience.

The above sentence is not *entirely* true. I've had my little gnome necro in
the Warrens for the past few days, and noticed this interesting fact. There
were times where I would not get xp from a mob, and a "this kill was
trivial" message popped up. Then, there were times when I would not get xp
from a mob, and got *NO* trivial message.

Now, thinking about this, could it be that the ones I killed had no loot
that TLC affected? The kobolds drop molars which are no-drop, but not every
kobold has one. I suppose that could be why I received the message on some
and not on others. Either way, I thought it was an interesting fact to share
with the group.
