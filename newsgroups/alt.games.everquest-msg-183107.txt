C & D are cool, but I'd prefer something like the current dungeons as
done in AO missions. I.E.  you could get some friends togeather give
them a key and go to a dungeon (only not randomly generated boxes like
AO) you could clear it out - no repspawns, if anyone else wanted to join
you in the dungeon you have to leave and give them the key.  If others
want to go to the dungeon but don't want to be with you they can make
their own group, get their own key and go into a copy of the dungon with
full monsters and no other people.  

This would prevent the two most annoying things with camping spawns that
currently occur.  1) sitting around at a camp forever waiting for
respawns.  2) Other people sitting around camping spawns that you want.
