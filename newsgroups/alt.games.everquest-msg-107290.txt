Hmmm I tend to be non role non anon in higher zones. Lower ones if not busy.
Role when I am kinda doing stuff but welcome a tell.
Anon when I want to kill you just for saying hi. Some folks look to give
tells to anon folk assuming they are druids( moi ), wizards, chanters or
clerics. If I respond to an anon tell its generally a Do I know you ? What
do you want ? You paying 1 K to say hello ? type of response.

I find anon fits my kick the dog moods.
My non anon rogue is for other moods.

Some folk see the anon tag is for hiding etc. I see it as a mood warning
label.
