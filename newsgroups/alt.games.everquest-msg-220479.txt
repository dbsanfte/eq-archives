I was trying to do this quest to raise faction for my Paladin Soulfire
quest.

My paladin was aimiable to Ruklin, and he was giving the prompts.

Got to the part where he said that he needed someone to retrieve the corpse.
Handed him the fish, and I got "You disgust me, leave my sight...etc etc"

Conned him again and was now apprehensive.  This is supposed to Raise
faction, not lower it.  I /petitioned, but answer was "that's not supposed
to do that....try turning in gold pieces, it's easier."  Gee, big help...I
know it's not supposed to do that, and yeah, I really want to sit there for
days turning in 2gp at a time.  Anyone know if this quest is broken?  And
no, I didn't kill a Koalindl to get his corpse.

I guess it's back to killing bandits.../sigh

TIA
