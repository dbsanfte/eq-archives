All of these are viable.  The DE Shadowknight is the toughest of those
options, since Nektulos isn't a brilliant newbie zone (there are worse,
but kills can be thin on the ground in Nektulos).  A halfling warrior
will have a very easy time killing stuff in Misty till level 12 or so.
Note that tinkering isn't an option for gnomes till level 16.

That trip is doable at level 5 if you're very careful about avoiding
trouble.  Don't travel through Kithicor at night.  When travelling
through West Commons, staying high on the wall on the north edge will
avoid being spotted by anything you can't handle.  East Commons is
somewhat safer, and you can probably follow the path there - watch out
for lions & bears though.  Spiders aren't a problem, they're not
aggressive.

If you mean the tunnel on the south side of East Commons, that's
actually a tunnel to North Ro (which is also reachable from East
Freeport).  Nothing very exciting in there, there is a vendor called
Shady Swashbuckler who will trade with any class/race.  There's also an
exit from the north of East Commons leading to Nektulos - the guards
will not welcome good race/class combinations.
