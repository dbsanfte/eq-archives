Greetings all!

First time posting to this newsgroup, so bear with me if I step on
toes. :-)

Just a question of curiosity; what the heck do I do with the Golden
Bandit Teeth that are found on the bandits in WK? I've heard
scuttlebutt that they're for an armor quest or something. Could
someone point me in the right direction to get started; whom I turn
them in to, etc.? Just point me in the right direction to get started,
that's all I ask!

And Also; to whom do I turn in the Blackburrow Battle Plans? You get
them off the gnoll tactitician in BB, but I've tried everyone in
Surefall. Any hints, clues?

Thanks!
