There was a guild on Rallos Zek like that. In fact, they were talented
at training just long enough, then bailing before a GM had time to
show up and witness. They even had on their message boards discussion
of what the safe number of times to train another group was before a
GM was likely to show up. They were rarely actually caught in the act,
but were enough to border on having their guild disbanded by the GMs.
Finally, the leader went off on the GM and gave the GM solid reason to
not only disband the guild, but ban the leader as well. :p
