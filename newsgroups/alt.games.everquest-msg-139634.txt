I am playing my first caster and my wiz just got his "Nexus Gate" spell. So
I was all excited after I got my last spells from Freeport and was prepared
to gate back to Nexus with my new gate spell, but when I cast it, it said:
"You must be on Luclin to cast this spell".

WTF?!?!?

I mean I can cast Fay Gate from Luclin, why not the other way round?

Any explinations welcome.
