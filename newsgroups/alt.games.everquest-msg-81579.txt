S3 Pro is really crappy videocard.
like the older SIS ( i think that was the company behind it, if not i
apologize )
video cards. these older cards used to cause problems like that with
different games for me..
better just buy some card with nvidia cips. geforce or at leads riva tnt.
btw.. ATI cards suck hard too.
