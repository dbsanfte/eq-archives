Well I personally tried PvP servers a few times, considering
that people of my own race wouldn't even let me do more than
turn in my guild note before they started pking me, every
thime i tried.  I said PvP is a bunch of crap, and gave up
on it.  Yes I thought it would add to the roleplaying
aspects of the game.  Did it? No it lead to people being
jerks and killing you because they could.  PvP is full of
adolescent morons as far as I am conscerned.
