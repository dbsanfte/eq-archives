    The only fault that has been allowed to grow out of control is that the
people in charge of development for EQ are keeping their jobs.

    You saw it coming, but I still feel for the wizards. Raid wizards
actually use this to do early damage and space out mod rod usage over the
course of a fight. But I guess tuning it to not work on the usual list of
farmable targets, but to work as is on proper raid targets, would have been
too hard.

> > Complete Heal is being reduced to a 7500 hitpoint heal.

    I can't write what I think about this in a forum where children might
read it. But I will point out that since CH is still the most efficient heal
in the game, CH rotations will STILL happen. Only now MORE CLERICS will be
in them. Yes, that's right - this change has made the raiding game MORE
DEPENDENT ON CLERICS THAN EVER BEFORE. Good job, Verant.

    I'll love to see the slipshod job of "tuning" they'll do on high-end
mobs to compensate for this. People have no idea how huge a nerf to all
casters this is. Our necromancers are already screaming that they're about
to be turned back into twitch bitches, right after getting their freedom
with the DoT stacking changes. And they're right - they ARE about to go back
to pure twitch duty.

    I have to wonder if this change will happen only at level 60, or at all
levels. Like levels 1 to 50, where monks have been balanced since the game
was released and where the issue of massive +HP items narrowing the gap
between tank and monk HPs doesn't happen. Guess we'll see, huh?

> Clerics aren't really going to get hit that bad, IMO.

    If anything, we just had our desirability increased a ton! Isn't that
wonderful? Won't you be happy knowing that as you progress up the raid
ladder, you'll need more, and more, and more clerics TO THE EXCLUSION OF
OTHER, LAG-CAUSING HEALING CLASSES?

    That changes the day PoP comes out. As I've said here before - our
current top warrior, without any gear changes but with PoP AA's and buffs,
will be over 10500 HPs. He was already going to be over the CH limit.

    BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

    I'm sorry, but you have NO clue on this. Lemme throw a few facts at you,
and let you fill in the tedious math.

    Typical boss mob kill in Vex Thal: 30 minutes. That's with 60 people.
For the entire length of that fight, you have four clerics each casting CH
every 15 seconds or so. So they're spending 1600 mana per 10 ticks, before
Specialization: Alteration checks (foci don't work on CH). My mana regen
comes from Flowing Thought and AA's (I'll be generous and throw 18 in here,
even though I don't have that), self-buff for 6, C3 for 14, SP for 7, and
bard song for whatever that does (I'll over-estimate and call it 20). 75
mana per tick, or 750 mana per minute (you sit to med, you die, so I don't
throw that in there).With the new mod rod limit of 320 mana per minute, I'll
be losing 500 mana per minute and will go through my 4500 mana pool (which
is pretty damn big) in nine minutes. If we DOUBLE the number of clerics
there doing CH, then my mana loss and mana regen will be about equal and we
can do fine. Right?

    Wrong.

    How do I get that one rod per minute? Well, a mage needs to crank them
out. How do mages crank out as many mod rods as they do now? Well, they eat
their own summoned rods as they get low on mana and have a cleric (mod
healer) CH them back to full.

    But now the mage can only eat one mod rod per minute. So now we need to
crank up the number of mages there, or bring more necromancers/convert
existing necromancers to pure twitch duty. We'd need to do this anyways if
we ever wanted to CotH ourselves somewhere in a reasonable amount of time.
So fine, we bring even more people along to do the same support job as
before.

    Nope, we're still short.

    You see, we still haven't provided mana regen for all the offensive
casters at the raid. Wizards and druids also chow down on mods so they can
nuke more and help bring mobs down faster. Wizards, in particular, eat mod
rods like they were candy. So either we bring more damage dealers to pick up
the slack, or bring more mages and necromancers whose sole job is to be
support, or we bring more clerics to deal with the longer duration of the
fight.

    We were already at 60 people when this whole process began. How many
more people can we bring before the lag becomes unbearable? I already have
to stare at the floor for the entire fight so my spell gems refill after a
spell cast in two seconds. How many more people can we pack into this
process?

    Now, take those numbers. 60 people, boss fight, 30 minutes. That wasn't
for the big boss, Aten Ha Ra. We killed her with 45 people recently. It took
**75** minutes. Yes, we fought for an hour and a quarter non-stop. Wanna
speculate on how many more we'd need for her? Or how many more people one of
our rival guilds, that does the Ring of Vulak in FOUR HOURS NON-STOP, would
need?

> have to mod earlier and balance out their mana better.

    See insane laughter above. I already eat a full mod 3 rod every minute
or faster just to keep up with mana expended on a typical boss fight. Now
you're cutting the amount of mana I can get from one in half, and telling me
to "balance out mana better"? Did you think I went down to zero mana, modded
myself back up, then CH'ed myself and took myself out of the CH rotation?

    Hopefully, after reading what I've written above, you'll change your
opinion on how different it will be.
