dont blame this on beasts. any pet class could do it. blame it on no /pet
hold  command.

ultimately the rules for raids are this. if you have /pet hold, you can have
a pet on all raids.
if you DONT, and the mobs AE. NO PET, AT ALL.
if you DONT, and the mobs do NOT ae, shouldnt be a problem. most raid
targets AE tho.

Also once the mob is parked in his spot its usually ok to load up the pets.
except where the mob will split (like the zeks do in tactics) into multiple
mobs, or summon mobs that can AE.
