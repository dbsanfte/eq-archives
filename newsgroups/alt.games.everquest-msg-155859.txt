ROFL.  So where's the webpage for "Team Trueshot"?  Now that you mention
it, I'm wondering if 5 Archery AA maxed Rangers with top-end bows and
arrows and a Druid couldn't pull this off in similar fashion.  Even the
rapid team assembly wouldn't be tough if the Rangers had Thurg gate
potions.  The idiots (and I do not use the word lightly here) you quote
were probably traumatized by a L20 Wizard KSing the Orc Trainer in
Crushbone 3 years ago, perhaps they should sue VI to pay for post-
traumatic stress counseling.

Well, I'm sure there're plenty of people who'll bitch in the fashion
you say.  My bitch is that it's just too damned easy, start to finish,
for a handfull of high levels to monopolize content that's intended
for, and highly valuable to, a far broader section of the player base.
It isn't the "KABOOM" part that bothers me, it's the situation as a
whole.  It's just utter BS that on a server that has an active "Team
Manaburn" any non-"uberguild" Warrior (Bards too?) is gonna find his
epic being held for ransom by a gang of extortionists.  And if "Team
Trueshot" were out there doing the same thing it would be, amazingly
enough, the same thing.  And the idiots you quoted above would be,
amazingly enough, idiots.  The wrongness of "Team Manaburn" has
nothing to do with the game mechanic used to kill the dragon (or
whatever), and everything to do with the easy monopolization of game
content important to many by a tiny few.
