Are you casting the first heal spell too early?  Ie when shes still at full
life?
There isn't a "known bug" that the first of any heal spell has no effect.

Just sittin is good enough.  It used to be a requirement that to regain mana
(meditate) you had to use the spell-book (which filled the whole screen)
pre-35, but that got changed a while back.

You can cast SoW (spirit of wolf).. and you can make SoW potions.  The
difference is, you need to be around if they need the spell SoW refreshing.
With the potions, classes who don't have the spell simply buy a 5 or 10
dose, and then cast it at will.

Some potions are not spells that you have (e.g the gates, damage shield),
and some (such as sow) are direct copies of spells you have obtained (or
will soon) in your spellbook.
