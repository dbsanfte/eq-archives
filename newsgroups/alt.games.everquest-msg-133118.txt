Far more reliable than "drink a beer and see if that makes them
run slower"

Soloing as a cleric means root and nuke.  Nuke breaks root, so
you have to root again.  While you are re-rooting, the mob is
running right for you.  Fizzle or resist and the mob is -on- you.
Without SOW or T/JBoots, you now have to channel root.  This
is a very risky way to kill things.  One of my favorite mobs as
a young cleric was Spectres... because they move at snared speed.

While SOW or TBoots do allow you to run out to max cast range,
you still only have the time from max range to melee range to cast
your spells.  But with Snare, it takes the mob longer to traverse that
range.

Not only is the symbol far easier than JBoots, far cheaper than TBoots,
and far far cheaper than a continuous diet of SOW potions, it actually
works better.  Find it wears off a lot?  Recast while you wait for
nuke to cycle.  After all its free.  Clicky items allow a different strategy
from cast ones; I've found great use for Donal's Arms, Donal's Boots,
Thurg legs... even though they cast spells I either gave up long since
(valor)
or never cast at all (tremor, word of healing)

If I"m happy to cast outdated or relatively useless spells when they
become free, I'd be much more happy to cast a low level spell I can't
otherwise cast at all.  Look at paladins gleeful about getting Divine Aura
in their 50s... when its a first level cleric spell.  (not a great example,
since its a spell that -isn't- outdated at high levels... but you get the
idea)
