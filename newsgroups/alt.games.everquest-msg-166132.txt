Well I am hoping that the group will be able to shed a little insight on
some of my newer ports that I have recently aquired but not, as of yet,
used.  After an emotionally scarring port in to Wakening Lands , IE I Ported
in, Woushi was up, my CoV faction wasnt as good as I would have liked, and I
was slaughtered like a dog, I have been a bit reluctant to use my new ports
to Skyfire, Emerald Jungle, and Cobalt Scar. I have done a couple of ports,
one each to Skyfire, and Emerald Jungle without any ill effects ut I
basically Ported in, waited for my passengers to zone in and then gated out
myself. What I guess Im loking for is information on the 3 zones in
question. What kind of Faction do I need, are the port in spots usually
safe, and I am ESPECIALLY looking for any information on how to raise my CoV
faction other than mindlessly slaughtering Frost Giants, and Drakkel Dire
Wolves in Great Divide. If thats what is necessary Ill do it, but Id prefer
to do somthing thats a little more interesting. I dont think Im quite big
enough for Kael yet ( Ill ding 46 Tonight WOOHOO Planar Capable!! ),
although I suppose I could try to single pull the spawns near the Wakening
Lands zoneline.

In any case any information that anyone can provide is greatly appreciated!!

And now on a totally unrelated note, has anyone else noticed the STEEP
decline in price for a KEI ? IVe paid as little as 50 plat, and regularly
now pay less than 75 per casting on Vallon Zek.
