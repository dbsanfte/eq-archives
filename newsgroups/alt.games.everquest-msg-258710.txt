Did you like to be told there is a list for gatorscale leggings camp,
and you are number 75 on it ?
At level 49 I was running around with a Sarnak Enforcer,in case
you dont know what it is being as ueber as you are and were,its
a 7/28 1H blunt without any stats.Do you really think that was fun ?
And please dont tell me I am a incapable player,because I refuse
to join a bunch of jerks called guild and do longish,boring events
called raid.
