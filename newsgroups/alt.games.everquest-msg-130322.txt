BTW This is a Monk talking but herei is the info I have on FD
FD will not work if you have any DOTs on the MOB Darkness type even though
they will slow the Mob they still do damage over time FD fails.

FD will fail if the mob is in the process of casting a spell or attack you
must FD during the delay between swings.

FD will fail if you have a pet attacking the mob

FD will fail if you are caught in the range of an AOE

I have heard FD will fail if you are healed while and only while the mob is
standing directly over you but regen has no effect.

I have also heard some mobs can't be fooled
