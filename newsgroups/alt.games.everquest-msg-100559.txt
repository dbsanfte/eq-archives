I had my 52 Druid in Fear this weekend in a group with a Warrior,
Cleric, Shaman, Wizard, and an Enchanter.  Pretty much the definition
of the word "humbling" for me.

Basically, every class has a 'weakness'.  Druids strength is that they
can do a little bit of everything, the weakness is that we don't do it
as well as anybody else.  Mages strength is that with their pet they
can produce a metric assload of damage, their weakness is that pets
aren't appropriate everywhere.  Just like druids can still help in
raid level groups with stuff like back up healing, mages still have
things they can do for support like mod rods, summoned items, and CoH.
It's not glorious, but still useful.
