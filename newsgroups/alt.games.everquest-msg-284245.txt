Couldnt agree more, and its one of the major reasons why I and many others 
jumped ship when WOW came out.
WOW still has some keyed zones, but the quests are something that can be 
done solo, or in a small group, and dont rely on camping non instanced mobs, 
so you cant be clockblocked.

I didnt have much issue with the locked zones in Kunark, Valious or Luclin, 
because it was just one zone at the end of the expansion. but POP was where 
the wheels fell off. Ive heard they learned their lesson and recent 
expansions dont have so much locked content, but its too little too late.

Sadly SOE have got their hands on Vanguard now. I was looking forward to 
trying that out, but not if its going to be another SOE game. If nothing 
else I dont feel like shelling out money for an "expansion" every 6 months. 
Aside from being clueless, SOE are too greedy.
