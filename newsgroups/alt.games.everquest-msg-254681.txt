Yes. Grouping.

In a group where you are fairly static, a horse is a huge help.
Particulary for classes that have to change spells often. Lack of
sitting agro, and full sitting mana is awesome. Solo though, pet
classes will find the horse to be really usefull.

Don't use a horse (or the slow horses anyway) if you have to:

1.) Move alot
2.) Melee
3.) For some reason need to bind wounds or natural regen HP.

Though honestly most classes that get any benifit from the sitting
mana regen, have little use for melee or HP recovery.
