I love foreign movies, I went through hell finding a zone 1 copy 
of Asterix et Obellix contra Cesar ... some bizarre korean 
pressing, not certain if it is actually legit or not. Is great, 
in original french, subtitles available in english, korean and 
chinese.  A much better version than the cartoons, has Gerard 
Depardieu as Obelix=)  In the US the flirting and love from afar 
bits between Obelix and Parfallana would have been cheesy and 
more direct, and not at all *cute* [and at least i can understand 
the french, but listening to it in the dubbed korean is a blast=)]

At least animated features like Atlantis arent cheesy 
americanized garbage like the live action movies are. Probably 
why I tend to watch more animated flicks than television=\
