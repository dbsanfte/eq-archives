My objective was to let Annie know that Reg is a troll and a stalker,
and she took offense for some inexplicable reason. Because I did not
intend offense, I tried to explain that I was not trying to give
offense, and she took more offense. 

As far as "rabid" goes, I have to say your standards for what
constitutes "rabid" are pretty mild. I'd hate to see how you'd react to
true rabidity.

PS: An "I know you are, but what am I?" response? Please.
