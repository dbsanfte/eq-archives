One hint: if you haven't already, refrain from training evocation until 
level 22. Making the skill available at 9 but making us wait for our 
first evocation-based spell untill 22 was just plain mean. Ever tried to 
cast a level 22 spell with the skill of a level 9 caster? Waiting until 
level 22 to train it causes your starting skill level to begin at a much 
higher number.

I'm going to try and hold off training divination until level 30.

Can anyone chime in with what number the skill level will start at if you 
wait to train it? I haven't made it that high yet, so I'm still unsure.
