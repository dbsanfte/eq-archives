Yes JaZZ, thank you! Those were *precisely* my questions. I don't think I
was as clear as I should have been in posting, and I appreciate everyone's
patience with me and my questions. Thank you!

I'm trying to find someone who actually plays the game in our small town,
but that's kinda hard to do. Could prolly get it from ex, but he's up to his
eyebrows in work this week (something about a ship date). I may just have to
take mom up to walmart and have her buy it for me -- she works for them, so
I'd at least get the 10% discount!
