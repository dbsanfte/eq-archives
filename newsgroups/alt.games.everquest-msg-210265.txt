Whoa!  slow down!   Of course not!  
My ranger is level *56*.  If you read the previous posts (and the previous
thread I started) I didn't even start wondering why my archery was so .. umm...
*bad* until I was a master at it and level 50+.   And, yes, it was a bit
disheartening to learn that I would have to be 65+ before I would really hit
for *good* damage.
Quick history:  My ranger is my main and untwinked.  I rarely used bow and
arrows in the early levels because I found *snaring* or *flame licking* was an
easy way to pull and *free*.  I attributed my crappy archery to my mediocre
skill in it, cheap arrows and handmade bow.  Then I got my Tolan's Bracer and a
Compound Steelshaft bow, became a master - 213 skill -  and my bow hits were a
whole lot better, but nothing like I thought they'd be.  At level 56 I have a
Blessed Fay and I'm still dissappointed.  
You can call it whining - whatever.  But the guy who started this thread was
asking a question - and I didn't want him to think that *everyone* thinks it's
just spiffy that he will have to be level 65 before his archery doesn't suck. 
Better to know *now* before he sinks a lot of time and energy into it thinking
he'll be *good* in 30 or 40 levels, because it just isn't going to happen.

I love my ranger.  I didn't pick her because of her archery skill - she can do
*so* *many* other kick ass things (snare, root, dots, heals, buffs, sow,
harmony, sneak, invis, levitate, track... just to name a couple :)  
I *assumed* that at some level I would be able to hit for more than 50
regularly.  I just never dreamt I would have to be level 65 before that
happened:  Since a ranger is *known* for their archery, (as a cleric is known
for healing, rogues are known for backstabbing, etc...) maybe it was naive but
it seemed logical ...  my level 56 wizard BF regulary casts spells that hit for
700 + !!!
