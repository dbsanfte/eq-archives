If so, there's supposedly a card in the box where that has a code for
$100 off a Falcon Northwest computer. The code isn't unique. (Anyone
that bought Everquest lately has the same card with the same code on
it.) If possible, can someone post it, or email it privately to
mauimakaio@NOSPAMyahoo.com (remove NOSPAM from the email address
please :)

I have an older version of Everquest that didn't come with the
card/code.

Thanks in advance :)
