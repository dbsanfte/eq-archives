Merging Servers

The most recent server merges are complete and both newly merged servers 
are showing a healthy population and, as with the combined Zek servers, 
exceeding their previous combined population totals.  As such, beginning 
April 11th and continuing until the completion of the process, we will 
continue merging all standard rule-set servers.  The servers will be 
merged in the following order, on the dates listed.



4/7 Brell Serilis merges with Cazic Thule and will be listed as Cazic Thule

4/11 Morden Rasp merges with Povar and will be listed as Povar.

4/11 Lanys T'Vyl merges with The Seventh Hammer and will be listed as 
The Seventh Hammer.

4/14 Tarew Marr merges with Drinal and will be listed as Drinal.

4/18 Mithaniel Marr merges with Saryrn and will be listed as Saryrn.

4/18 Tholuxe Paells merges with The Rathe and will be listed as The Rathe.

5/26 Terris Thule and Prexus and will be listed as Prexus.

5/30 E'ci and Tunare and will be listed as Tunare.

We understand that server identity is important to our customers and we 
will be integrating server titles into the title system to allow you to 
display your server of origin, should you desire to do so.  The server 
title system will go live with our April 6th Update.

Unutilized Character Purge

Immediately preceding the merger, all characters below level 10 that 
have not been logged in for over six months will be deleted from each of 
the merging servers and will not be available after the server merge. 
If you have a character on any of the servers being merged that is below 
level 10 and has not been logged in for more than six months, you will 
need to log that character in prior to the scheduled merge date for the 
relevant server.

Shared Banks on Merging Servers

If you have characters on two servers which are being merged together, 
you will need to clean out the shared bank on one of those servers. 
After the merge, only one shared bank will be available on each merged 
server.

Character Limitations

If you have more than eight characters in total on the two servers being 
merged, only the first eight characters (in alphabetical order) will be 
displayed after the merge.  Characters other than the eight displayed 
characters will not be available for selection until currently displayed 
characters are deleted.  All characters from both servers will remain on 
your account provided that the character was above level 10 and had been 
logged into game within the last six months.

Corpses

Prior to the scheduled merge date for your server(s), please be sure 
that you clear any unclaimed character corpses from the world. 
Character corpses will not be transferred to the newly-merged server. 
Once the merger is complete, all corpses on the servers affected by a 
merge will have been purged.

Duplicate Character Names

It is possible that characters on servers affected by the merge will 
have duplicate names. In the event that characters on the new, combined 
server do share a name, the character with the most played time will be 
entitled to keep the name. All other characters will have the letter X 
appended to their name and will be eligible for a name change. 
Characters can use the in-game /changename command to request a new 
name.  The new name is subject to the conditions set forth in our naming 
policy which can be found here: Naming Policy.

LDoN Leader Boards

After each merge is completed, as characters log into their 
newly-combined server, the leader board will be re-populated with 
standings. Although your points will be unaffected by the transfer, your 
standing may have changed based on the new, combined population totals.

Complimentary Character Move

Shortly after each merger is complete, we will allow all customers 
affected by a merge a one-time, complimentary character move to the 
server of their choice.  For each customer with an account on a 
newly-merged server who requests such a move, all characters associated 
with that customerï¿½s account will be transferred to the selected server. 
  All characters will bring their items with them in the transfer.

Please make sure you are aware of your servers expected merge date and 
prepare accordingly.  These dates are subject to change should we need 
to alter the timetable of merges.  Should we need to change the dates we 
will post the new list with plenty of advance notice.
