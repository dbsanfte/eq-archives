That's what we've stated all along...both a warrior and monk can bandage
up and be ready to fight again starting at 50-70% health (not to mention
mend).  A rogue MUST get to damn near full health just to attempt a
low (not light) blue, and even then I've won fights just because I only
fight single mobs that will run when low on health (because some
blues can take you down so close that even with 1100 AC at 54, you
are praying for them to start running before they hit you one more time).

A warrior/monk doesn't care.  The warrior is only down to 30% health,
and the monk can mend/FD if things are bad...
