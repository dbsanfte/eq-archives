Someone here (I seem to remember it was Jazz, but URL is no longer on sig if
it was) had decent website with component lists for the Velious armours.
I need to improve a few locations and I am going to have bite the big one
and work for them <sigh>
Can anyone point me in the right direction? Jazz, if it was yours, is it
still up?

Cheers

CF
