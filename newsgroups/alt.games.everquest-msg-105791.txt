I actually think the opposite is true. The new low level EQ is custom
tailored to high levels creating new alts. They already know EQ inside
out and were losing interest in bringing low level up through the first
10 levels. Boring for them.

On the minus side, true newbies will never learn the game properly this
way. Instead of having level 1-5's running around knowing nothing,
you'll now have level 11-15's doing the same in higher zones ruining
that part of the game for experienced players. On my server, it's very
apparent. Zones like Oasis which were nice levelling areas for mid-level
alts, is now overrun by crowds all kill stealing, shouting, whining for
rezzes etc.

I'm a newbie myself, but went through those boring (at least I thought
so at the time) lower levels. I now realize that as a result I know the
game much better than I would have had the Verant "hand-holding" been
around at the time.
