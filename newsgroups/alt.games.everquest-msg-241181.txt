Heh.. good advice overall. But that usually applies when a device
doesn't show up at all. (ie sometimes your sound card is in device
manager... and sometimes it isn't

No 3d devices discovered is not a 'contact' problem... if your
computer couldn't find your video card it would have complained long
before you ever got near launching EQ... probably with a black screen
and a series of beeps ;)
