One of the biggest pains is NBG groups in certain area which are melee heavy
drops. As a 59th druid sitting in the maze in CT watching named after named
drop little or nothing the the hammer of havoc for wisdom based class! So if
you endeavor to lead a group plan it as best you can to be either 1 roll and
your out til everyone gets am item. Raid style works on leader holding all
but no-drops til the end of the raid. That keeps the person waiting on just
his drop from the famous wow I got the Silvery belt of Contention.. oh darn
I gotta go now.. sorry all from happening. Set a loot plan prior to going in
and stick to it no matter what. Only exception would be the dreaded LD
factor. Just my 2 cents..
