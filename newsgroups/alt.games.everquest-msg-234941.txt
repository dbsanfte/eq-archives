I would guess that the first one means that the login server refused the 
connection, the second one means that you along with 100,000+ others are 
trying to connect to it, and you never got a response.  Either way, you 
cannot tell anything about the status of the servers based on the 
message, you will get them interchangably, and it just means that either 
the server is not up yet, or it really is too congested.  At least that 
has been my experience.
