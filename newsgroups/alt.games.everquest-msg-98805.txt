 I've also been posting to USENET since before the advent of TCP/IP, Windows,
etc. ect and way back when, top posting was the prefered method, not forcing
people to read what they just read in the previous post again. But as more 
people began using USENET, little by little bottom posting was demanded by
the readers.
