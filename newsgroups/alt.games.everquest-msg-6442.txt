Look again. He specifically states "Paladin guild," "try some of the
quests," "guild note," mentions starting a new player to drop and retrieve
said guild note and being unable to do quests because he's too high level.

He's not talking about player guilds, he's talking about his class
guildmaster.

Zooli, others have answered for you already. Allegedly, it's no big deal.
Maybe you can start a new character and switch over your note for piece of
mind, but I seem to recall the note being No Drop. Doesn't matter anyway,
quests are based on faction. As long as you con amiable or better, most
should be available to you. I seem to recall a few that require a warmly
con, but that could be my memory failing, and I haven't the energy to check.

Look here : http://everquest.allakhazam.com/   and check for quests on your
Pally guild's faction. You'll see if you're all set to do some quests,
which, at level 35, your faction should be fine.
