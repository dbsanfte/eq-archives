Now you are just plain lying, since that was in an earlier post, and
not the one you replied to.

You realize people can check that sort of thing, right? Avoid lies in
the future.

And quite a number of those I do in fact consider bad changes even
when they *helped* the raiders. Your confusion over my earlier post
which was referring to what I consider good and bad vs the post you
actually replied to which was more concerned with what was good and
bad for casuals (and raiders) is very apparent... if it wasn't in fact
deliberate. I don't hold every view the raiders do, even if I support
them more than I do the whining powergaming casuals.

No, you were too clueless to figure out what the point was.

Is it such a shock to you to find out some people liked the faction
system? You are really showing yourself as one of the lazy new kind of
players now....

Of course you neglected to mention how someone is being forced to do
so. Not to mention every single server has an out of game trading
forum somewhere.

Just admit that bazaar was great for the casuals and quit thrashing
around.

Well, if anyone here would know, it's you. The point was that they
were improvements for casuals they don't acknowledge, dipshit. Do you
think you get to change the point at will when it is MY POST you are
referencing?

Have you ever had a clue?

No, you dumbass, it's not - it's gear most casuals could not get, by
your own admission, on their own - but any casual can farm plat.

Your cluelessness knows no bounds....

Their whining has basis in reality rather than envy. Uqua being broken
was not something denyable. Casuals not being catered to was complete
shit from the start.

Your judgement on who's a fool, given your total idiocy so far here,
is not particularly concerning.

SOE knew that something was wrong with EQ globally, from the total
lack of sales of OoW. It doesn't change the fact that casual whiners
don't appreciate what they've been given.

Your attempt was beneath me. You seem to think it replaces evidence

Unfortunately in your haste to lie about which post you replied to you
missed the distinction between what I feel hurt the game and what hurt
the game for the prototypical raider. The focus changed between the
post you lied about replying to and the one you actually did.

It's not all about just time or effort. It's also about risk and
responsibility. Look at the rest of the thread to see the destruction
of the line of argument you just opened.

Sadly true, other than the appreciation part. Moremoremore.....

Also sadly, you'll drag a once great game down with you in your haste
to have everything handed to you on a silver platter. We've been
seeing it happening for years.
