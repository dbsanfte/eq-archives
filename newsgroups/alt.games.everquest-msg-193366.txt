Welp, the one that comes most readily to mind was when my wife and I were
working the chessboard in Butcher Block. We were both wood elves that didnt
speak a word of dwarvish. Along comes what I now assume was a dwarven
cleric, and starts gibbering at us in an unknown tounge. Eventually we got
the idea that he wanted to group with us. by using various emotes, and
actions we were able to work out a kind of shorthand sign-language, sort of,
that made coordinating our efforts possible. Wouldnt have been possibe
though if we werent willing to work as a team, and put some creativity into
our communicating.

Other similar experiences have formed the opinion that I have about the
language "barrier" on FV :)
