Anyway, while we're talking about prophecy, let me recommend Terry
Goodkind's novels, the Sword of Truth series.  If you like the Wheel of
Time, or any other in-depth fantasy, you oughtta read this series.  Among
its many merits, it deals at length with prophecy.  Its points about
predictions can be summed up thusly.  (Note: this is not a textbook on
prophecy.  It's a fantasy series.)

1) Prophecy is a code delivered by the prophet, representing a vision he had
of the future.

2) Each verse is a code-key that unlocks, for other prophets AND NO ONE
ELSE, the vision of the original prophet.  In other words, it takes a
prophet to interpret prophecy, and anyone else who tries is merely wasting
his time.

3) Prophecies are interrelated.  Each prophecy is built upon previous ones,
and a diagram of their connections resembles a tree.

4) Certain prophecies fork, which means there are two possible outcomes
which contradict each other.  Based on the outcomes, certain other
prophecies lying along the branch not taken are rendered invalid, while
still others are raised or lowered in importance.

5) Prophecy has a way of coming true in some way or another no matter how
you may try to prevent it and usually in a way you didn't expect.  Often the
very act of attempting to prevent one leads to its occurrence.

6) A prophet has the toughest job in the world.  Knowing the future means he
must exercise utmost care in what he tells people.  The wrong word to the
wrong person could end a war or start one.  Prophecies are about important
events, and the prophet must not tip the balance.
