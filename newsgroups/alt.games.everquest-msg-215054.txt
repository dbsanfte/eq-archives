ME TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

of the universe of fennin, i can share what i have gathered so far:

[pre-post edit: after checking over this post, i must make a disclaimer to
the effect that the comments i made here are based on what i have observed
first-hand and through second-hand means, and it is all according to the
best of my knowledge...if arcane phalanx broke up, don't shoot me or call me
a liar...i am not a member of any of these (nor was i ever) and i present
this info (however subjective it is) in the hopes that i can help someone
and someone can help me, since i am also looking for a 55+ guild on fennin
that does constant raids (and yes, i *am* leveling to 65 =P  ) ]

--good / great guilds to check out--

*crimson dragons - the big family....so big in fact that you'll never feel
at home, like family =P...however, they do raid a lot, and they raid with
the BH (brotherhood), an alliance that includes <crusaders of drunken might>
, <bane sidhe>, and some other guild that's been in the shadows for years
...they do big raids ... ave. lvls 30-65

*nobles - they raid 2 or 3 times a week, at least, and are small, but
powerful....the thing is, they do a lot of the "oh, he's my rl friend, take
him" (*cough* noob) kind of stuff, so they end up wiping or cancelling a lot
(so far, one or the other on every raid i've attended as a potential app, in
the last few weeks) ...they do a variety of raids ...ave lvls 50-65

*new dawning - again, just like nobles (i was seriously considering both of
them)....they're higher quality than nobles, but they have some members with
real ego issues...on the whole though, they're definitely worth looking at
... nice raids, ave lvl 55-65

*arcane phalanx - i thought they split up, but they haven't (?) ... very
nice people, most of which are married and playing with their
spouse...others are generally 30+ or mature enough to not matter....high
standards, though from what i hear, laid back in the raid department
(they're powerful but they don't push themselves.....again, what i hear, i
haven't barked up their tree since i heard they were changing leadership /
going under) ...

*house of swiftjustice - powerful guild, raid often, but have plenty of bad
members making a bad rep for 'em....like a mini DoN (see below) .. ave lvls
55-65

*keepers of kithicor - they raid a lot, i always see lots of them
around....they have good members, they have bad members, they have a handful
of great members...they are high level but i don't know enough about them

*dynamic universe - i think they were an alliance....they're good, lots of
people, lots of power, but i don't think they raid often because i think
they're clique-ish (read: 7th grade girls who ignore the fat 7th grade
girls) and there's more 1group-this-high-lvl-thing than
5-group-this-hard-high-lvl-thing....not sure on ave lvl, but i suspect it
60-65

--in case you were curious (i'm not)--

*la familia - every raid i've been on with these people, i find that 1/2 the
raid is afk, being 2boxed...really makes for poor raids (naptime!), but i've
never been considered an internal member, so i can't say anything about
whether they have the helpfullness of most other guilds with ave lvls 1-65
(plenty of 65's too)

* norrath's advocates - /yawn ....when the big B was in charge, he and his
wife would do 2+ events a week, usually one of which was mandatory (not sure
if they got out of kael or not =) ) ... ave lvls 35-65

*norrath's elite guard - seen this guild form and seen it "build" ...they
have a lot of members, but command far less respect than even la fam...had a
friend in it and he learned almost nothing about the game, despite being 55
and having spent 20+ levels with NEG, plus being an officer...1-65

*vis a tergo - they were literally the most annoying and disrespectful guild
on the server about 6 months ago...but i've found they somehow, through open
recruiting ( / BOGGLE ) picked up stable, good members, and probably
disbanded the earlier members that found their way under so many peoples'
skin....i don't know anything about them, but i would advise they not be
discounted automatically

--be honored if they let you app--

*realm of ages - all these people are high quality....very respectable, you
can trust any of them, they're fun, they know what they're doing...65+title+

*caelum infinitum - like RoA, not sure if they're considered uber or not,
because they keep a low profile...very attractive guild with talented and
mature members....65+title+

--category of their own--

*pink attack bunnies - they're around NToV, or were a few weeks (months?)
ago, last i checked...haven't seen them 'around' lately, but again, last i
checked, they raided frequently and knew their stuff...big spread in quality
though, from mediocre to quite talented ....lvls 55-65

*primal dreams - roughly same power as PAB, not sure what they're hunting
though...it's probably my own delusion here, but a lot of the people who
tend to guildhop usually end up here, in my experiences...go on a few raids
as a potential app, see if you like them....their members vary from
assinine-but-funny to take-the-enchanter-AND-the-bard to dont-speak-just-do,
so proceed at your own discretion...ave lvls 55 (if not 60)-65

--punks (ubers) --

*severed - this is the one i would join; their raids are like carnivals and
you're 6 six years old

*dragons of nightshade - IDIOT 12 year olds, EVERYWHERE

*the mystical order - premadonnas, arrogant, and noobs compared to the #1
guild on other servers

*aversion - mini severed? mini NoV? forgot

*night of vengeance - heard good things, heard bad things, don't know if
they're around (split) or they have a new name (migration)...any NoV i've
grouped with have been excellent players but not the most fun human beings
to chat with

-- "foreign" --

*east dragon - everyone hates them! everyone! but they (*sigh*) are a really
tight raid guild (just make sure you turn off all chat channels so you don't
have to hear things like "move pull wait loz" because WTF does that mean?!?)

*venturi - the euro guild .... very nice bunch of people, get a lot done,
nice raids, but their hours are euro....

*core of legends - the uber guild for hk's...if you speak as they do, join
when they let you!
