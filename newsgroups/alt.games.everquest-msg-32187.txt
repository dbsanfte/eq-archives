If you have to ask, you can't do it yet.  =)

Really, you need to be 50+ to do the epic quest.  And you will definitely

Atrocity merely arms the future for more atrocity. It is self-
perpetuating upon itself--a barbarous form of incest. Whoever commits
atrocity also commits those future atrocities thus bred." Frank Herbert
