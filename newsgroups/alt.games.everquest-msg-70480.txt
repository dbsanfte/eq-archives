Instead of all the hardware problems, bug bitching and Verant bashing,
how about a nice, lazy, old-fashioned thread on playing  the game and
what people are up to?

Took my 51 warrior into Seb and spent about three hours at the jail
tanking for a group of Chanter - Cleric - Monk - Monk - Shaman.  It went
beautifully, with no deaths and a nearly non-stop flow of frogs and
leezard necros. Of course, the only freaking roll that I won all night
was for a high level necro spell that my alt can't use for 29 more
levels, but the xp was outstanding.

So what were YOU doing last night?
