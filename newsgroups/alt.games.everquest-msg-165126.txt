Actually, you're wrong Dennis. I've been using my cleric SS armor to
summon food and drink for almost a year, mostly in Dungeons, and the
consumption was always equal food and water. When PoP came out and I
started hunting PoV regularly, I immediately noticed that water
consumption was doubled compared to food, as I would start each session
as usual, summoning a dozen of each. It doesn't take a stopwatch to
notice you've run out of water and still have a half dozen food left.
