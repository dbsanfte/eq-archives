Additionally, tailoring is a special case in that all(?) recipes
require components which are mob drops, and many of which drop from
common low-level mobs at that. Anyone who even thinks they might 
want to take up tailoring one day is well advised to hoard all 
of the usable silks and pelts they loot while leveling up through 
the single digits and teens. Otherwise, you'll have to spend time 
later on slaughtering green mobs, digging through merchant inventories 
hoping some other player has sold them what you need, or auctioning 
for the stuff.

With any(?) other trade skill, you can just put it off until you save 
up some plat, as you can gain skill using store-bought materials.
