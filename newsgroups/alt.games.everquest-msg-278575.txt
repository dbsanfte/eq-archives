Agree with most of this article. This is the holy grail. A balance
between solo and group play where all classes have a part to play.

I can't really agree about EQ2, at least when I left. Although they
were madly adding solo content due to the loss of players to WoW when
I dropped my sub it was still very much the case that grouping was by
*far* the only real way to go. Most remained simply undoable solo. I
left at level 30 DESK and very many quests I still couldn't solo until
they had gone green or greyed-out and I'm a seasoned MMO player. Not
the best by a long shot I admit, but seasoned ;). This may have
changed more since I last played though, how much more I don't know.

WoW obviously is *far* more solo friendly. Before I actually played
it, well over a month after its launch, I'd heard that it was a solo
fest. That was part of the reason I held off buying it, that and the
hope that my issues with EQ2 may get addressed. I finally started
playing WoW about six weeks odd after its release and discovered that
even in WoW grouping is still the best way to go for the most
efficient XP and for quest and instance play. I suspect WoW players
that are not MMORPG virgins have all realised this.

Then there are the PvP hunting and raiding aspect of WoW which you
will suck at unless you understand the group dynamic. You'll also suck
very hard in WoW higher level instanced dungeons if you have mainly
soloed and will likely find the post 40 game suddenly becomes very
different to the one you knew until your mid thirties. There is the
social aspect too. I play on a Role Playing server in WoW so my
observations are based on this.

I'm not playing up WoW, I'm an ex EQ and DAoC  player and IMHO these
two games are remain the best MMOs and supplied me with the most fun
I've had online gaming, but maybe WoW is a tad closer to the balance
than some folks may care to admit.
