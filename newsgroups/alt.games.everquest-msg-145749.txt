Tried to get on today after patch, but game freezes after char select 
screen.
Try a few times on 2 different chars. Still cant get in.
Go out of game and delete Thurg and CobaltScar files (my chars were in 
those zones) and patch them again, no result.
Call my friend who ARE able to get in, and ask if hes still using the 
skin he sent me a copy of last week. Yep, working fine for him.
Try to rename my skin folder, just in case. Success, can now get it. Try 
to do a /loadskin myskins to get my skins back. Comp freezes.
Reboot again, rename skin folder to be able to get on, and try once 
more. Comp freezes.

Why the BEEP do they still manage to mess up the skins on every patch. 
Every patch since they added skins, i had to delete my skin files to get 
back on. And this time its even skins that WORK on friends comp that 
just wont work for me. Worked before patch, so must be something VI 
messed up today.

Oh well, apart from me having to customice all my skins for the 4th 
time, its been a good patch, love my new Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl.
