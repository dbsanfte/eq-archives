It definately helps to have a guild. I went on my first raid with
guild at level 23 to Sol A, it was a blast and I ended up getting the
scraps and leftovers which were not bad at all. Went recently to ToFS
in Iceclad, it was nice and now I know how to get back to Kunark from
there. It is a great learning experience of the atlas.

I have done this pattern with a few side steps into dungeons like
Kaesora, and that one in Warsilks (forgot the name), and it helps to
break up the boredom of always shouting for a group. It helps to have
guild with high level members. My guild has raids almost every week,
and the dungeons are great.
