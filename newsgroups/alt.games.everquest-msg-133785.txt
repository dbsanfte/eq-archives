Enchanters keep them AE stun locked while pulls are coming in, then the
enchanters keep them stunned while wizards/mages/druids/cleric/necro/crazy
melee with a PBAE proc/etc PBAE nuke them to death.

Wizards are the most efficient mana/dmg ratio PBAE casters, mages aren't too
shabby (and btw,they can cycle the 51 Scintillation with the 39 Flame Arc
spell to maximize output), Clerics I think are actually more used for the
group heals than the Upheaval/Unspoken Word spells, rarely see druids in
PBAE groups, but Upheaval makes it possible, necros 'can' PBAE, but they
suck at it since the best spell is Word of Souls (155dmg/target, 171 mana),
never seen a crazy melee with PBAE proc (IE Earthshaker off Yael) do PBAE,
but it's possible I guess, and better effectiveness than just having them
pulling (besides, epic wizards make the best PBAE pullers).
