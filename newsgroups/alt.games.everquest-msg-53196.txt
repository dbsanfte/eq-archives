Just get a linksys router and you shouldnt have any problems.  I have 2
comps hooked up behind mine at home and no ports are opened and I can
connect to the game fine all the time.  Both comps are on and playing and
neither is exposed to the internet.  The DMZ mode on routers is only for
hosting games.  It actually has no effect on whether or not you can connect
to a game server.
