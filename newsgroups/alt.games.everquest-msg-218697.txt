Sounds like rationalization to me.  Something you accuse Republicans
of doing.

I did if you would read.  You made specific reference to my quote,
which was not based on my opinion but rather someone elses.

Sadaam was not reasonable, so all reasonable action had been
exhausted.  And why would the threat necessarily have to be outside
his country?  Do the people of Iraq not deserve protection as well?
Even from their own government?  Keep in mind they have no means to
defend themselves so letting them handle it is not possible.

The line of logic states that if the populace is content everything is
good.  If it's not, and it has no means to change it, then they need
help.  Not an excuse, just a fact.

I think anyone who planned to attack America before Sadaam may very
well be thinking twice about it.  It's not in any terrorist
organizations interest to have us turn our eye on them, whether they
perpetrated the most recent attack or not.  If I'm a terrorist and I
see what Bin Laden is going through I lay off, at least for a while.
And if I'm Pakistan or Iran and I see that the US will just go in and
route the existing regime I will be less likely to offer aid to said
terrorists.  Maybe that's too rational for terrorists but I think the
leaders are less fundamental.  If Bin Laden could have forseen what
would have happened he probably would have laid off a while ago.

I don't know anything about this so I'll have to research it.  I agree
undercover agents identities should be treated as national security.
I'll have to get more info before I take a position on this.
