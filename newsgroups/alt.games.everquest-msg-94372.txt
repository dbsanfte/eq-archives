You're a druid, fucknose.  You don't have to die.  You have this nifty 
spell called SoW.  It allows you to run faster than most mobs.  It is much 
safer for you to just zone.  If you're only looking out for number 1, it 
is still MUCH safer to just zone.  
As to dying for strangers in this game, it happens all the time, but you 
would have to be one of the 95% of players who actually groups with other 
people.  I certainly don't stop when I'm running with a train and die to 
my own stupidity and train the people sitting nearby though.  
Oh, and biz, by the way, this fantasy land we're living in is called 
Norrath.  Dying isn't really permanant there, and for many players, it's 
very much a part of the game.
