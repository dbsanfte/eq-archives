Jam Fest is evil. :)
When raiding with another bard with different JF levels only the AE
Songs of the bard with the higher lvl will stick. If you try for a wide
covered area with lets say AE resist you will fail. The moment you leave
the area of the other(higher) bard it's song will last its usual time
and then fade until you pulse your song again. If you're twisting 4
Songs this could leave you without bard resists for 12 seconds when
you are not aware of it. But this is the only thing that annoys me.

Besides that I do believe it helps with mezz for instance. :)
But unless there is some hard data backing that up it's just a matter of
belief. Since I've never ever heard it being useless I think you can
safely train to the first or second level.
