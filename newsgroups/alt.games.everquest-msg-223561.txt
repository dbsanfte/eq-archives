That's great to hear, since I'm a Shaman and Slowing is my thang

Oh I can't imagine making a career out of doing that, or even doing it
again. It was just an exploratory peek, you understand ... that kind of play
doesn't do a thing for me.

Why does no one go there?

Wow, that's harsh, but interesting. The other thing that's nice about FV is
that there are hardly any DODROP items. Just the epic and new LDoN items,
most everything else is freely exchangable.

Yes! That was it. Amazing how a few words can bring back a flood of
memories. I remember now doing that run through the Feerot on our way to CT.
It's funny, when I started playing EQ again before SWG (my shammy was like
23 or so) I took some other lowbie friends with me to CT to "show them
around". I had gotten to know the zone pretty well shortly after release and
had picked up lots of Rubicite and other nice goodies. So three of us
mid-20's go in and we were unceremoniously SLAUGHTERED at the entrance. WTF?
Only later did I learn that they apparently re-worked that zone to make it
40-50's. LOL.

Well the point for me would be to experience it just because I never have.

Now I do! :) Feel free to chime in whenever I start asking dumb questions.
This is the only game I've ever played where I've probably played it longer
than anyone I know (having been in Phase one beta), but anticipate that I'll
always feel like a noob! Took way too many breaks...
