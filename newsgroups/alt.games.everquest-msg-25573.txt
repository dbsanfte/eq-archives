I think you may have your expectations set a little high. Am I correct in
assuming that your guild isn't planar yet? I don't know how you can turn a
family-style guild into an uber guild in 5 months.

On Lanys T'Vyl I believe that only a handlful of guilds are Sleepers
capable. One was the infamous Conquest that got disbanded by Verant. The
guild that I've joined is an older one, and very well respected. The bulk of
our mains are in the 50's.. our leader is 58, and we have a 59 warrior. My
guild has done a ton of planes raids, epic raids, etc. I've only been in a
month and a half, and I'm amazed at the amount of stuff that is done.We just
had a 58 wizard resign his membership so that he could pursue a membership
with Visions (which is our new uber guild, a combo of old Conquest and Inner
Fire members). He left us so he could go to ToV, Sleepers, etc. He knew, and
our leader knew that it would be a long time before DW would be able to go
places like that, assuming we want to (not sure about that one). I looked at
the Visions message board, and right now they are *only* actively recruiting
level 60 wizards (with giantbane and dragonsbane) and shaman. The wizard who
left our guild has to raid with them enough to get invited to join, since he
is *not* level 60.

So, first of all you need to get your guild up to planar levels. People need
to start working on their epics (especially clerics). You need to lead a
bunch of raids to understand *how* to lead and organize a raid. You have to
network with the post-50's in the game so that when you do host a raid, you
can get the people you need to join you. You yourself need to level up. If
you want to be the primary tank, you need to be 57/58 I'd say. These are
just my observations from watching my guild in action.

I think you're jumping ahead to the end game (Sleepers) without realizing
how much you still have to do. Sebilis tends to be "bring your own group" -
and there is a difference between what a group of low 50's vs. high 50's can
do. My guild has been great so far.. they are family oriented, yet still
managed to get the levels on their chars. And, they help out the younger
members like myself. So far I've been to Hate, Sebilis, Chardok, and Skyfire
Mountains with the higher folks. I've helped out on 2 or 3 epics. Tonight
I'm going to Fear, and tomorrow afternoon we have a Kael Arena raid.
Everquest has become a whole new game by me joining this guild - and I know
understand why people over 50 say that the post-50 game is so different.
Heck, there are spats in my guild when early 50's folks can group with the
late 50's folks as much as they want.

My goals for the next 5 months? I'd like to be in the mid-50's by then. That
way I can contribute more to my guild, and group in Sebilis and get a fungi
tunic (haha, one dropped last night and our guild leader got it). I'd like
to get started on my epic - but I've got RoTWF to do first. I plan on
sticking with my current guild indefinitely - they have the firepower and
the connections to do fun stuff, but they aren't an ultra-rigid uber guild
with all sorts of rules about how often you play, how many times you have to
raid, and a point system to distribute phat lewt.

This didn't answer your question about what direction to take your guild.. I
just didn't want you to base a decision on whether this guild will get you
into Sleepers in five months.. IMHO they won't..
