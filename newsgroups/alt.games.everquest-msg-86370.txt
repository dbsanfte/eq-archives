For tanks this may be so, but I, as many other casters I know, bind myself
at the bazaar. It's a safe zone, encumberance doesn't slow you down, the
banker is literally 1 click away and all my spell components are within
arm's reach.
All that plus the ability for a non-porter to get to the 5 continents
decently fast whenever I want.
