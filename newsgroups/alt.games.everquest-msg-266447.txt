What kind of assault should Sony mount?  Threaten CGW that they'll stop
advertising if IGE is allowed to?  Intersting anti-trust issues there, not to
mention how bad an idea it is to piss off industry magazine editors by
threatening them.

Should the publishers of CGW ensure that all advertisers (how about
subscribers?) comply with the wishes of game companies?   

Even if you don't like it, no laws are being broken.  There is a ToS violation
being committed by EQ account holders who buy and sell things, but that's not
IGE, that's the buyers and sellers.  IGE has no agreement with Sony, so isn't
breaking any agreement.

Sony COULD mount a large-ish sting operation, spend a few tens of thousands of
dollars (including both payment and employee time), ban a bunch of accounts,
and put a dent in the market.  It would take Yantis or IGE somewhere between
2 and 6 weeks to fully recover, perhaps with somewhat higher prices for
awhile.
