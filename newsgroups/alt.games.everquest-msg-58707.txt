Hiya

My two cents worth , I know more or less what class is meant to do what job ,
and what starting stats to put in etc.  However , unless you want to be the
same as everyone else playing that char (bar skill) or are only interested in
being untouchable if you can (I would consider this boring) , then play it as
you like.  People dont have to invite you , and whichever way you play , you
will be able to do a lot of what is 'expected' of you anyway  , even if you
dont have 200int or 200wis or whatever.

I am just mentioning this as I have recently decided I want to melee a little
with my 30 Cleric , so am going to sacrifice some wis for str so I can wear my
decent armour , who cares if I cant do that extra 20% healing when it comes to
taking down the Sleeper etc.  (please dont tell me the people I am healing will
care , I know what you mean and I look after my group mates)

Just a thought, comments welcome.

Regards,

S.
