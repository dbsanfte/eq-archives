Just informing people on Morell-Thule or who want to be players of the
Morell-Thule Server.

"United Kingdoms" Guild is looking for new recruits to join us, web page is
being re-vamped over the next few weeks including a new charter which I'm
drawing up... here are a few things that I can tell you about us.

Generally were looking for people who are ambitious in terms of doing raids
2-3 times a week if possible & focused on epics & vellious armour quests etc
etc but more importantly is to have fun together within grouping.

Quite a few of our members have met up in real life & gone out drinking &
clubbing etc.... just goes to show how well we get on with each other within
the guild.  Were all good friends from all over the UK.

1) We play anytime during GMT hours, generally most people log on between
5pm to midnight.

2) Role-players or non-role-players are welcome, I myself like to
role-play...

3) European players who can play within our prime time are more than
welcome to join, we do have a couple of European players in our guild.

4) No particular level limit but anyone over level of 15 is preferred.
