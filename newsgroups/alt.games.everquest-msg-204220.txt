I don't understand this, especially the having to be logged into the bazzar 
bit. How does being afk in the bazzar for 8 hrs while you sleep make either 
your or other player's experience more immersive / real / "in-game".

Ok so you are saying that the walk accross the (laggy) zone and 3 clicks on 
a character to buy an item makes a significant difference to your gameing 
experience ? And you don't want it to be easier to do no risk activities 
like buying and selling because it would detract from your gaming 
experience ?

Or am I miss understanding ?

Ah so it is not the lag you like <G> I'm glade that we cleared that bit up.

Well, when hunting / questing / traveling there are decisions to make that 
directly effect how well you do. When buying and selling in the bazzar the 
decsions that you make either cost you or make you pp. Doing this out of 
game or with a more advanced in game tool would not change the skill 
requirements, just remove unnecessary downtime (Gawd am I starting to sound 
like a pro-kier ?)

Hee hee I think that 2) is a little extreem If they just turned off all 
spells in the bazzar then this would work (OK it would mess it up slightly 
for trade skillers)

So you want the tool improved, now I really don't understand what your pont 
of view is. But yes it would have to be a case of Selecting "This Stat" is 
{<,>,=} "This value" rather than free type your sql here :-)

I'm still looking for equipment for my enchanter. So I tend to do a lot of 
searches, e.g. Errudite, Enchanter, Primary, with INT then switch to 
primary with cha, then mana, then do them all again for secondary, then 
check ranged etc. etc.

Some of the selections that are available are only useable for a few items, 
while some of the above would be great for more. Plus you can only select 
one thing at a time. If only you could say you wanted something with 2 
types.

Ah it is that invisible line again. I should have read that line first. I 
agree that having the whole bazzar run off line with no real in game 
component would be slightly mad, but if they could do a few little things 
like improve the tool, make it so you can buy from the tool, make it so you 
don't have to drop your trader flag to buy and preferably add a WTB option 
then I would be happy. 
If they could some how change it so that the zone was much less laggy then 
that would make me very happy. If they could then increase the 500 trader 
limit and allow peopel to "camp to trader mode" for a max of say 8hrs then 
I would be extatic.

Swapping it all to an online trading tool would be mad.

So in the end I think we almost agree, it is just that your line is a 
little closer to "now" than mine is :-)
