So, the servers were just about to come down and I had some free time.  Did
a few binds outside Qeynos and with the SOW one of the trolls gave me in
return for the bind, I decided to run to Marissa to turn in some GLS.

Well, I'm zipping along the highway to the zoneline in the Qeynos Hills when
I see a half elf, in banded and dual-wielding a sword and whip, sitting in
the road.  I noticed an extra long name and stopped to take a longer look --
hmm, not bad a surname already.  We talked for a bit and he says, "Hold on
for a sec"

He sits and (I guess to ) meds.  Then he gets up and slaps a SOW on me!
