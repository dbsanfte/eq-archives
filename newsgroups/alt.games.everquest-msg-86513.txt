I know my gnome necro is KOS to Kaladim, Halas, Grobb, Ogguk, Fironia Vie
and Cabilis (of course).

I was surprised that I was dubious to North Freeport, Erudin, Kelethin,
Felwithe, and South Qeynos.

Note that you are dubious to Rivervale, although you are KOS to the cleric
guild there.

I don't know how I started in High Hold Pass, because I killed Chief
Gan'Shralok enough to become ally before even stepping foot there.
