DSP runs (at about 30%), Marus Seru runs, the Bazaar sucks hard, and
Sanctus Seru is iffy.  Shadowhaven needs to be at about 35%, but
Paludal (except for the lake) runs alright.  Shadeweavers is stuck at
about the 50% mark.  Haven't had a problem in LDoN at all, and most
dungeons run reasonably well.

Granted, the fact that my two primaries (Cleric and Rogue) are hardly
ever pulling means I can survive with the clip plane cropped, but
seriously, after about 50% it doesn't make that much difference.

Of course, I do realize that most of the other funky stuff is off as
well.  Particle effects, showgrass off, no Luclin models, and pretty
much every other trick to squeeze a few more FPS out of the engine.

It's probably not quite the same game that most of you are used to
playing.  Still having fun though.
