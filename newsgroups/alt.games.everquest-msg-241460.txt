Very stupid 'reality' TV show, people marooned on an island or somewhere 
remote, they have stupid competitions and each week vote someone off the 
'game' and the last person standing gets $1 million, more or less. For 
several years it has been incredibly popular to argue about.

=) made it myself. Black velvet. I am adding around 1200 2mm seed pearls 
and around 120 5mm seed pearls to it. That should only take about 200 
hours=\ But I love having parents who *know* what makes spiffy christmas 
presents...pearls are always a good suggestion=)

Don't want to moderate, already moderate 3 email lists. But I am 
actually on every day [ok, I confess I was away for 3 weeks in Feb, an 
couldn't access my newsgroups due to computer difficulties...] But in 
general the first thing I do when I wake up and wander around doing 
breakfast, housekeeping tasks and general mucking about is reading my 
emails and newsgroups, and I tend to check several times a day. And I 
will confess that I actually read all the threads until they devolve 
into straight flames, then they get scanned, and certain authors skipped.

I really *hate* not working, and at least being online takes up 
otherwise empty time.
