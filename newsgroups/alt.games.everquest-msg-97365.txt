Why do you think it should be 1-5 instead of 1-10?

Unfortunately, levels 10 and below are generally too low to

Sometimes you just have to tell the newbies how to play the
game.  I don't mean anything bad by this...well...other than
the fact that EQ isn't newbie-friendly...(I personally know a

What happened before that created issues?  I'm just curious
since I'm fairly new to the game (only been subscribing 6 or
7 months).
