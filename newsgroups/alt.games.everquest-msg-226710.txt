Having a Slower is more valuable, maybe, in the higher LDoN or in a bad
group. At 65 we never go on a LDoN without a Slower......unless it is
Mistmore and we have a necro.

A shammy is my favoutite in a group for slows and hastes, they can take the
hits when they get agro, and can do some minimal crowd control in a big
room. I'd take a shammy and a bard over a chanter any day :)
