Others have given good advice.

If this is your first time trying to zone into a Luclin zone,
the most likely problem is that you installed the Luclin expansion
to the wrong directory, or haven't registered it yet.

Try doing a file search (on Win98, it's Start/Find/Files or Folders)
for all "*.s3d" files.  They should all be in your Everquest
directory, wherever that is.  If instead you find some in
one directory, and some in another, you've installed Luclin
to a directory other than your main Everquest directory, and
that would produce your problem.  To fix it, just move all files
from your "Luclin" directory into your main EQ directory.

An additional thing to try is to delete all the *nexus*.* files
from your Everquest directory and then re-running the patcher.
This will download them fresh, and fix your Nexus files if
they are possibly damaged and causing your problem.
