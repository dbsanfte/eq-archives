Yes, I am a bit lazy in my posting.  And I don't usually question
anyone's grammar or English unless:

-Their message is ambiguous.
-They try to prove their "intellectual superiority" to others by
correcting the spelling and grammar of others.

You mean "typos"?  We can do this all day if you want.  But since you
are the only one who seems to think that spelling errors indicate some
kind of inferiority, it will hurt you much more than it will hurt me. 
In any case you were criticizing him in his ability to write with
proper grammar and spelling when he was indeed trying to write well. 
That means you were criticizing him as stupid, not as lazy and
immature.

Oh I wasn't aware that placing superfluous commas in a person's text
was a form of vernacular writing.  Is accidental comma usage a kind of
"ghetto speak" or what?

You were criticizing him to make him feel bad about himself and you
feel better about yourself.  You criticized his ability to write when
he was _trying_ to use proper grammar and spelling.
