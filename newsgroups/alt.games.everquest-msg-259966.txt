Yeah, they spawn dynamically and out of sight of the person who triggers the 
spawn. My wife and I used to play side by side and I could see on her 
monitor mobs that spawned as I moved, although I was not able to see them 
spawn on my screen.

You're saying that mobs never patrol? Maybe most of them, but I know for a 
fact that Vahziloks would often patrol and wander into aggro range. For the 
most part I think you're right, but it's not absolute, there are some 
exceptions.
