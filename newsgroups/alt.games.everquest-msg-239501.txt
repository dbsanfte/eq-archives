This post my be old, but my comment on it anyway. Next time bring a bard. I
always pull with my ldon groups. Mostly b/c I can handle 2 add's and keep my
clarity going (no singing sword yet, and only lvl 52) Just beware Bards are
not normally twinked (Most that I seen). With there low hp they tend to drop
fast if pulling a  sitting caster(those that just do not want to enter the
slaying area). One nuke will drop them to half ( I take 800hp nuke while
puts me at 70%)but a smart bard will find a way. Playing a beastlord to, I
find it hard to pull with one (stupid pet), but great for saving casters
when they get the agro (nice puppy).
As for rangers using bows in LDoN's, it has it's ups and downs. A ranger can
outdamage a warrior with bows (up to the bow, and rangers class and skill
lvl.). A ranger needs to learn to use a weapon for close combat too.Only
time it is best to use bows is sure wins, but ask the rest of the group.
As I said before take a bard, or take control of the ldon. As a person who
does LDoN's for the exp, I also find it a pain to do LDoN's with a group
that do not know there place.I even been known to trap kill everyone after I
die twice on my cleric.
