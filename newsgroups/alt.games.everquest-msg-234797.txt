I'm still unclear, 3 players?  Running how many char's?
I know you can box a substantial number, but I don't know
how many you take on such a mission.

Yep - look at the class make up again.  I've never seen an enchanter
slow land on either, and my poor 62 BL (with only Mala and Tash)
got summoned after the 3rd resist, and only lived because I hit
PS before I cast the 3rd time (I knew it was comimg)  After the 
first couple of times we couldn't get slows to stick on them, and
won anyway, we gave up on it and just killed 'em unslowed.

Is that regular slow, or the disease based 40% one?  I know that's
the only one that lands on GotS - we took him unslowed as well.

What's the range on Chaoswind's AE?  As a mage I stay so far out that I
don't even know :-P  ERIV + FoT = 360 range bolts.

I know that Ice's is 100 - all healers have ERIV and we are VERY 
careful about push. (partly because of the adds waiting in the
back alcoves)

Well - at the time we had 3 minimum for these things - our druidess
friend of 3 years, the cleric I created for my buddy to 2 box
(after I realized I'm not much good as a healer while boxing.) and
a 2 boxed cleric that the SK ran.  We always felt lucky to get
another druid, and VERY lucky to get a shaman.

I honestly have to admit, I don't remember how this discussion
started :-P  I think it had something to do with me opining that
your time level gear is what made taking him with half our
numbers possible.

We never beat Thunderclap with that basic force - we used to get together
several mornings a week.

Well, the vast majority of the people who were part of the morning raids
have left my old guild.(*)  They took 20 people after the tower bosses
yesterday and wiped twice on wind.


(*)  I could write the death of a guild in 3 Acts, but you've
all been there I'd wager.  Drama, people leave, guild can't
take the big targets, people leave, guild absorbs a bunch of
lesser aa'd/experienced/leveled people to try and compensate,
people leave rather than deal with yet another rebuilding,
dedicated officers sweat blood to make it work with an alliance,
their play time is ruined by the demands, finally they
(my RL buddy and our druidess friend) decide they want a 
return to less responsibility and the chance to enjoy playing
together, last night 5 people took 9 high attendence raiders
out of the guild.  That includes Mairelon and Bosra, the
guildless.
