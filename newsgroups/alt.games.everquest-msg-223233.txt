I meant to expand on this:

Geo camp is a long passageway leading up to the exit, twisty but without 
any actual turns so you can't get lost once you reach the place.  At the 
base is a terror spawn, which apparantly includes two named on its cycle 
(I never saw any others anyway)< Hollow Crystal and Life Leech.  Drops I 
got were a nice 30 HP neck I'm now wearing, many Frostone Steins (20 
SvCold secondary), Crystal Fiber (1hs whips 9/27 or something, 5pp from 
vendor, but lore).  Crystal Fiber also drops off the regular terrors. 
That terror is the only mob in the tunnel that's normally KOS, the 
Geonids start non KOS to all, but you do take faction hits killing them. 
  In two levels I've dropped to Dubious, -still- not KOS, but I'm sure 
I'll get there.  If you are low level and move too far out of the tunnel 
following a runner its possible to pick up spider adds.

Geos spawn single at set locations up the tunnel outside of direct aggro 
range of each other, and don't move unless forced to.  After a while you 
can tell which ones will run up hill or down hill, and also learn to 
move them out of position before they get to running if you want to 
avoid the add on the ones that run the wrong way.

Three basic mobs: Geonids (the common ones), Focus Gem, and Gem 
Collector.  All drop pp, gp, sp, NO cp, gems and word/rune/pages, 
average around 3pp cash, which doesn't look like much.  Among the gems 
are Chipped Gems of various sorts, which look like stat items but 
aren't, instead they are vendor fodder going from 4gp (chipped cat's eye 
agate) to 190pp (chipped diamond).  After a while I could tell the 
relative value of any chipped drop just by comparing to the normal value 
of the item; diamonds, black sapphires and so forth were worth the most 
while chipped agates and malachites and such were worth practically 
nothing just like their unchipped versions.

The good chipped gems drop almost exclusively off the Focus Gem and Gem 
Collector, and so overbalance the rest of the cash output of the camp 
that really all you are doing is killing the regular geonids to spawn 
them... being paid about the same wages as killing anything else in 
zones anywhere else in the game at your level.  But you see an average 
of one of the two every cycle, sure none one or two cycles but as often 
two or even three in one cycle.  They don't always drop the best gems, I 
think when Tea/Lenny/Rzantha were there the top drops were worth 47pp or 
so, but it still does add up over time.

THe cycle is... hmm, I didn't count, 10 geo spawns or so.  Repop time is 
15 minutes.  With KEI I could clear all 10 spawns in 10 minutes without 
breaking a sweat, without it I had to work a bit depending on how high 
level the pops were but could still always get back down to the bottom 
before the bottom geo's repopped, worst case the terror I started with 
had repopped.

The principle danger of the camp is that it lies directly on the main 
route out of CC; people have to follow that ramp all the way up thru 
your entire camp to get to the exit... this means trains of Terrors or 
SPiders are a distinct possibility at all times, and that relaxing at 
the bottom of the ramp waiting for repop can mean death if anyone else 
is in the zone.  Did I mention I ate a couple unrezzed deaths?

There's another danger, which Rzantha and Lenny helpfully demonstrated 
to Teapray; at the top end of the ramp, the tunnel looks like it goes on 
around a bend... but its the zone out.  Very easy to accidentally cross 
the zone line unawares.  Up there you dump out into the EW area near the 
  outside of the RyGorr fort.  Lacking SOW or invis it can be hard to 
get back in.  As a mage, I of course Have got invis (better here than my 
cleric was) but here's the problem.  The exit is spawn site for Rodrick, 
a traitor coldain rogue, and often has a RyGorr Emissary there or a 
Frost Giant.  You exit on top of any of the three (often two of them) 
and you have no pet up, no SOW on, and can't cast invis.  Only hope is 
to run back in thru the fort awakening rygorr everywhere and make it 
back to CC.  I've done it several times using nothing but strafe 
running... but note the Rodrick has backstab, just to add to the fun.
