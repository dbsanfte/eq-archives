To reiterate what Valien said, don't buy a GF4 MX.  It ain't Scottish.

But to add, you're in a tough situation.  Right now, you're
card-limited...that is, your Voodoo is probably not able to keep up with
your CPU.  However, if you go to a GF4, while you will definitely see a
bump in performance, you'll not be using it to its full
potential...you'll be CPU-limited.  If you're not planning to upgrade
your CPU anytime soon, your sweet spot right now is probably a GF3 Ti500,
but I don't know if you want to invest in older technology.

I'd echo Valien's comment that you might want to wait for the 4200 to
come out.  It'll be somewhat faster than the GF3Ti500 on most of today's
games, and probably a fair bit faster on tomorrow's, assuming you get the
128MB version.  Alternately, get a Ti4400 or 4600, and a CPU upgrade.
Your motherboard can almost certainly handle up to a 1.4Ghz CPU, and can
probably manage one of the XPs that go even faster than that.  They're
cheap...about $100 for a 1.4Ghz shipped.
