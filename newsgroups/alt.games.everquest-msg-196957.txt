It has the full range of groups from bloody woeful (they'll get you
killed) to bloody marvellous (almost weep when someone has to log). You
can learn a lot about group techniques here.

Yes, in USA evening times, there can be two groups (GR/LR & WR/RR) with
lists for each longer than a group, but I've only seen that rarely. It
has to be one of the easiest places to get into a group that I've found
(except for waiting sometimes)

Go now and try it, whilst the new server is popular. I can recommend
Friday evening (USA evening times) on Morell-Thule as low numbers as
well.

Between levels 20 - 37, I've been around High Keep, but most of my
experience came from High Keep gobbies. A strong melee could also do
orcs and gnolls by themselves in High Pass.

I am having trouble finding groups in all the old places that they are
suppossed to exist. Probably a case of expansion packs spreading people
to new areas.
