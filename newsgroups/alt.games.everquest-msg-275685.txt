Good changes:
Level cap raised to 70
Tradeskill cap raised a bit, new tradeskill may go up to 500's
Lots of new and useful camps in OoW (DoN is still new so nothing
established yet)
Some new quests, many that are actually soloable
Up to 25 buff slots and extra song slots now available via quest in
DoN
Beastlord Hobble of Spirit now properly stacks with other procs
Your defination of uber gear is going to be outdated as new and better
gear in ooW and DoN
oh about 40 new zones including the useful guild hall and lobby
Lavastorm revamped, looks much nicier now
Less trains in PC

What has not changed:
My guild likes to eat gnomes
People still begging for mind crack in PoK
Regular trains in BoT
Raids getting wiped because someone didn't listen to the leader.
An uber looking character who plays like a major nOOb just bought it
off eBay. (I had a 70 beastlord who used level 9 pet summon! He was
wondering why it died so easily all the time while mine could off tank
in PoV easily), and a 65 cleric using a low level heal spell to try
and restore almost 40% of the tank's hp)
SoE still being moron.  For example, look up "Journeyman's Servolinked
Gloves".  Rogue only item that has +5 mana???

Bad changes:
some older quests seems broken since DoN
Can actually hear crickets in older zones
GM are no longer useful as they were stripped of power.  Can now only
do rez and settle disputes.  So if you lose an epic 2.0 item to a bug,
sucks.
MM and SP revamped to higher level
DL no longer safe for anyone.  My brother has 65 SK time geared with
200+ aa.  First time he went into DL after the quest changed, he was
on CR from PoK less than 15 seconds later.
New regular trains in OoW.
