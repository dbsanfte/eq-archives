}You also said Mangina instead of vagina is the effect received by said

}act in itself doesn't have much to do with the term.

*shrug* I heard it used to refer to that specific act long before I heard 
it used in any computer game.  And I've never heard it used to refer to a 
transvestite or transsexual as a whole.  It's just an issue of what ya do 
with that one specific body part.
