As an example, say someone is level 51 and they start on there AA.
They need to train 6 points and be level 55 before they can move onto 
the next type of AA(archetype?) 
But do they have to stop at 6?
Say as a druid i wanted to get run, improve wis, maybe also improv 
agility all to max is this possible
I realise getting the extra levels is more beneficial short term to get 
all the AA but i was just wondering if giving the necessary time to do 
it if there was any reason a player couldnt train every single AA skill 
to max?
Also i was wondering if i decided to get to lvl 55 first before gaining 
AA points is there any issues with doing that? I realise if i only start 
at 55 id still need the 6 points in the general AA before i can move 
onto the caster AA
