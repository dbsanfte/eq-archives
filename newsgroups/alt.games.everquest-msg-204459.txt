Grr, 51, I got mixed up with my previous post about thinking SHeal was 52.
Anyway, not 57, which reading elsewhere in the thread I see you already know.

One possibility would be that the guy had just leveled to 51 and didn't have
his spells with him.  Hard for me to imagine, when I get close to leveling up I
start carrying spells around with me... but I understand some people don't
think that way.
