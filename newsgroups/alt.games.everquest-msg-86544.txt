Actually, killing the Great Oowomp doesn't give a VS hit, but all the ogres
around him do.

I was camping him with a human monk who was nonkos to both OT and FV
outposts, and I kept getting attacked by the ogres (wood elf druid) but I
had to solo them because the faction hit wasn't a good idea for the monk,
however Oowomp himself gave no faction hits, he was also dubious as opposed
to the other ogres being scowling.
