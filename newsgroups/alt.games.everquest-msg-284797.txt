I would say the level does indeed factor in.  My 52 paladin has not
landed the first two stuns in about 5 levels now.  I have all 4 stuns
loaded and use each one in sequence, but the first two just don't
land, ever.  However they still seem to generate aggro which is part
of the reason for them in the first place so I still cast them.

The mobs that resist the first two stuns are stunned by the last two,
so it's not that the mobs are immune to stun, just the lower stuns.
