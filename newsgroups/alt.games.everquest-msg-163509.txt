For a level 39 spell, this thing has sure had a long run.  I
started casting it regularly at around 45 (on tanks in their mid
50s) and have been doing so ever since, in its heyday I bet I
cast this easily 80% of the time, not just over any other heal,
but over any other spells whatsoever.

400 mana for... well more HP than any target I ever healed ever
needed.  Just hard to beat.

With the advent of Ethereal Remedy, this dropped down some, there
were times when casting 1000 hp in a couple seconds was just
better than 4000+ in ten seconds, as in the difference between
alive and dead.

The second I hit 61, my CHeal cast ratio plummeted still further,
for that same 400 mana I could get 1550 HP healed in 1.8
seconds!  Life and death, life and death, and the mana ratio
sucked even less than it did before.

But not only that, PoP changed what I was facing.  Damage comes
in FAST and HEAVY, and waiting around 10 seconds is less and less
an atttractive option.  Times when I have to cast SR (or would
have had to cast ER) happen more and more often.  And CE ( a nice
upgrade of Celestial Healing) became my mainstay "cheap heal",
used for topping off people who got early aggro damage but
weren't going to die because now the MA has it in hand; SR for
them if they are still getting hurt, CE if not, saves a good deal
of mana.

I've learned to use CE more and more, now, like I used to use
Celestial Healing in my 40s, because aggro issues are of critical
importance, heals are needed early and that means that there's
not enough taunt out there to prevent mobs from turning on me...
and their extraordinary unslowed damage output means I'm a thin
paste on the highway when this happens.  I just picked up
Supernal Elixer, and I'm hopeful that it will put the HOT style
heals back up to the top rank, where they were from around 44 to
50.

While I'm sure I'll never be able to stop memming CHeal, or using
it, its very nice to only be casting it as 50% of my heals;
thought and tactical awareness, instead of just a sense of when
to mash the only button that matters, is coming back to the fore
of playing a good cleric.

Oh, and for "spell I cast most, not just heals..." Yaulp V hands
down.  Love this spell... gotta figure out how to automate it so
I don't get bard's elbow!
