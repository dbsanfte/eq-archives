Since it's a "donation", I personally think that the chanter should be happy
with whatever they get as long as that donation is in what I would call
"good faith." My bard obviously has no need for it, but my caster types will
donate based on how much they have and the requisite benefit to them. My 29
cleric simply can't afford that much (so she often goes without, but may
donate as little as 10pp, and tries for 20pp). When she's 40 and hunting
better loot zones, I suspect she'll be donating at tad more (hard to say
since she doesn't demand or even request donations for rezzes, and folks
don't donate much for even a 60% rez). When she's 50 you can be that
donation will be certainly 50 and more likely approaching 100. I find that
almost all the chanters I deal with are pretty happy with this arrangement -
they are not at all offended by my 10pp donation from my 20 something, but a
fair number of them are less than please with 50+ casters that toss less
than 50 or even 70pp in the window.

On the other end of things: I had my 16 druid in the nexus, and ooc'd a few
times for ANY mana buff in trade for a SOW so I could work on skills
(managed to get to level with decent dots, but having a 0 conjuration
skill - bad, bad, bad). A high chanter dropped me a tell, took me in, C3'd
me for nothing, and gave me a full fledged Thank you when I SOW'd him. Was
very nice - I got over 100 skillups of various spell skills off that C3, and
I had a heck of a time spreading the generousity by sitting in various
newbie zones giving my piddly 16 druid buffs and summoned food/drink away
like candy. I was actually great fun.
