First go to Luclin and buy Focus Death for your pet if you haven't done so
already. Then go back to Odus.

Kill the Kerra Isle entrance mobs until 16. The experience bonus in that zone is
huge, so those two levels will fly by. You won't earn any plat but you won't
care because:

The Warrens. Go back there with your new spells and pet after your short
vacation on Kerra Isle. Farm bronze, armor and gemstones. Forget about Bronze
Tantos, though, they're heavy and they don't sell for much.
