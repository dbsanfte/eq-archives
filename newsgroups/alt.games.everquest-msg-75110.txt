Well, my paladin finally hit 30 and, I realized that I wasn't going to get
decent XP anytime soon.  So, I figure I'll start trying to build her coffers
until I'm out of the first hell level.

Can anyone suggest a good place for her to make some cash?

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
