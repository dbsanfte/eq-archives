> What do I do with this testimony?

Save it, that's the first step in doing your Firey Defender quest.

That's what I like about the Paladin quest; it's something you work on from
day one.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.

Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
