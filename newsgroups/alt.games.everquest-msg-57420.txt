Same problem here.  I was playing and logged off to find out who was
selling the self only Velious TP's (Apparently Srendon Gladetender in
the Kelethin Druid Guild if anybody cares) and when I tried to log
back on it tells me that that is not possible and to please try again
later. 

Personally, I'm saying screw it, it's bed time.  :-)
