So are you saying that I WILL need wolf form durring some point of the

If I have to get to TOX, assuming I can't get a teleport (and the adventure
might be kind of fun to try), how do I get past Erudin?  Is INVIS the only
way?  I know Freeport and Qeynos have underground passages.  Is that only
because they are the two major cities, and by some can be considered the
most important passageways in Norath?

How do you raise this faction?  Is killing the Kobolds enough?

Where do I get this quest?  Who does it?  Any idea how many bandages I'll
need?  Will I need another faction raised first?

I guess there could be some fun/challenge to be evil and always having to
watch your back.  I do have invis and bind (got invis, will have bind at
LV12, which is not far away).

Thanks for the confirmation on this, that is what I thought.

I might try killing the Kobolds in Toxx.  Like I mentioned, I've got the
Qeynos underground to get to the docks, and also I've got invis anyway.

Thanks for the info.  I've got invis, see invis, invis vs undead, and will
have bind at LV12, plus gate.  I probably could do the quest with enough
work and more help on getting things straightened out.
