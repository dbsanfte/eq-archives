I can assure you that kick DOES interrupt spells. I have high level
ranger and beastlord, and I have interrupted both npc casters and pc's
I was dueling with kick more times then I can count!!

The timing has to be good though for it work...as soon as you see the
message, so-and-so is casting a spell.. you kick

I remember one time I was partnered with a shaman and we were up a
caster npc... that fight was perfect, with kick I prevented it from
even getting ONE spell off.
