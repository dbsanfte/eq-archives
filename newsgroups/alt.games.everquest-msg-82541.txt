    That may be a long wait, my friend.  I
envision Biz as the "I'll be mellow when I'm
dead" kinda guy.  That said, I agree with all
of the above.  When I first came to this newsgroup,
about a year ago, I did the lurking thing first
for a week or so, just to have an idea of the
tone of the place.  Of course, I didn't get it
perfect at first, and Biz flamed me within my 
third post, more or less.  I'm glad I had taken
the time to learn to consider the source, and
not respond in kind!
   I'm kinda glad he's around also.  When some-
one posts something idiotic, I know that I don't
have to bother thinking up something vicious to
say.  And your right about the good info also.
   And about the sausages.  I like the kind 
that come in bbq sauce, which I used to be able
to buy, but I can't find anymore.  So if anyone
knows where they can be found in or near to 
San Diego, please send a tell!  But I'm not 
going to zone to Los Angeles or Yuma to find
them.
