I use it all the time, and in fact, I make my UI look quite a bit like
the old original interface. THe parameters are:

/viewport x y a b

where:
x is the starting horizontal marker for the new viewport (left to right)
y is the starting vertical marker (top to bottom)
a is the distance you want to cover horizontally
b is the distance you want to cover vertically

At my current resolution (I think it's 1200) I set mine up as follows

/viewport 0 0 900 575

This gives me my viewport starting in the upper left corner and leaving
a black section along the bottom big enough for my chat windows, etc.
and a narrow black band on the right side where I have the buffs, target
window, group window, etc.

I generally leave my spell icons and such on the left side superimposed
on the picture because they don't take up much room anyway, and a couple
things along the top of the screen.
