 One has to wonder why. Do people actually like the Warrens loot rules?
Warrens is a pretty underutilized zone these days. Of course with how
easy it is to generate trains there maybe that has something to do with
it as well. I see it as an experiment. Do you think the experiment
produced the desired results?

 Anyway, it's your game I guess. That, along with the ugly models I've
seen so far, is probably why I won't buy Luclin.
