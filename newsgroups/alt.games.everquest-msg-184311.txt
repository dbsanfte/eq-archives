I agree with the other sentiment here, that this is a bunch of bull. 
one man who took his own life out of 400,000.  That's waaaaaay less than
statistical averages.  

I also don't think a warning label would do anything.

I am however sure that Everquest is an adictive game.  All my friends
who play it, including myself have missed work to play it.  At the
height of my playing I quit my job, it was probably a combination of
things, but I'm sure EQ was a contributing factor.  Some of my friends
have even dropped our friendship and can't be pried away for real life
socializing.

I don't think of myself as having an addictive personality.  I rarely
drink, not even caffine, don't smoke, don't gamble - I have tried
gambling, but didn't feel the slightest twinge of anything from it that
was like a high, just seems like a timewaster to me.

I seem to have trouble quitting this game though.  The longest period
I've quit for was 6 months, but during that period I started in on AO
for 3 of those months.  I can't seem to keep myself away more than a
week usually.  I don't even know why I play, I just get depressed about
everything, not enough PP, dying, not getting a group where I want, not
being able to go on raids, nerfs, bugs that result in losses, jerks,
etc. Some of these things hav even brought me to tears...  But one of my
friends will mention something about the game, and I start itching to
play again.  I manage to keep myself going to work, and even have a
girlfriend now who doesn't play.  But I resent both of those because
they keep me from the game while at them.  - Sounds like addiction to
me.

I worry that should I have kids I wouldn't pay attention to them due
eq...

Although unlike what other people have described for thier outside
addictions, I can assure you if my girlfriend came up behind me feeling
amorus while I was playing, I'd gate and camp quicker than you can say
"/g got to log now, sorry bye!"  And if I felt like killing myself over
it, I'd hold the mouse over the delete button far sooner than a gun to
my head.  

After all if he's confusing RL with the game, didn't this guy learn
dying is no fun, CR is a bitch!
