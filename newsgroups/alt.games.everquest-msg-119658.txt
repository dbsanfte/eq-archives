Yes, it can hit magical. I wanted to test this in EC.  I was prepared to
gate the first hit I saw it couldn't.  However, even a light blue one is
deadly if you don't have full HP & Mana, and another passer by joins up with
it (my pet didn't have his buff spell yet either, so he died pretty
quick...that probably would have saved me, as maybe one or two more LV12
lifetap spell, max 45 HP damage, would have done it, which is equivalent to
6-8 hits from my pet).

And at my playing hours, I shouldn't have much competition.

Can I bank in Qeynos though?  No faction work needed?  I'm dubious to all of
Freeport, except apprehensive I believe (maybe dubious) to the barbarian at
the EF docks, and apprehensive to the EF & WF underground tunnel guys.  My
"Knights of Truth" faction (N Freeport area?) is dubious.
