Hi Andrew,

To take a screenshot just press the minus key on your separate numeric
keypad. You can also get the interface out of the way by using F10, and
change to different views with F9 but you may already know that. As for the
boats I'm afraid I haven't actually got around to messing about with the
small ones yet so I don't know that one :)
