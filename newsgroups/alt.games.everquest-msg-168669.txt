Well, my attitude toward casters has gotten worse with each expansion. VI
has played to many people's worst instincts, imo. As soon as a parchment
drops, it's "casters roll". Well, sorry...it's been a while since PoP came
out, and as a 65 tank who watches casters sell spells in bazaar for up to
35kpp or more...I'm done with it. Any exp group that I'm in, if I am not
allowed to roll on the parchments (talking ethereal here, not spectral),
then I leave. Imo, bad enough casters get spells on raids given to them for
no dkp, but to expect an endless supply in exp groups is too much.
