I'm not totally convinced by this.
If you had said 5 blue or 10 blues I may have been.

E.g. I am currently leveling a low level necro by soloing.

A low blue mob will net me about 1/3 of a blue bubble
An Even (White) mob will net me about a blue bubble.
A YTM between one and a half blue to 2 blue

I havent taken any reds, but I'm guessing that they would be abour 2.5
blue bubbles.

or 7 or 8 times as much as the blue mob.

Of course as said else where the group can kill 8 blues quicker than one
red (in general).
