 Well, why should I? You're also assuming that high quality items will
be available for purchase.

 It's not about stooping. It's mainly about having the ability to get an
item without spending money I probably don't have. I put in my time. I
developed my character into a powerful individual in the world of
Norrath. There's no real role-playing reason why I shouldn't be able to
get items for myself in zones that didn't even exist before I levelled
up. TLC is like saying Microsoft can no longer acquire small tech
companies. Perhaps that's a bad analogy but work with it a bit. You'll
come up with something.

 You've surveyed all higher-level individuals who are camping loot from
mobs that don't give xp, have you? I've never been to Perma for a Runed
Circlet. I've never camped Runneye for a BABS. So stop with the
generalizations already.

 In my opinion it's normally xp/'safety' that drives zone utilization
and not the loot in there. Before Kunark I went to lower guk because
that was the natural progression (other than solb) at that level. Loot
was really a secondary consideration.

 It's no longer an experiment. Warrens could be considered an
experiment. Stonebrunt could also be called an experiment. Implementing
TLC across the board in Luclin no longer qualifies as an experiment in
my opinion.
