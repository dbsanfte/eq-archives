Hey perhaps am I the 100th guy to say but hey:

THANKS ALL

I really love this newsgroup because I may learn a new thing almost 
everyday, even if I am not asking a question myself!

I learned so many tricks about the hotkeys and socials, as an 
example, less often some strategies (because there are many classes 
and as many strategies for each one).

My next lesson will be to learn, alone, all the abbreviations for 
the zones in the game, because -Hell- I am quite a static druid as 
I cannot play as often I'd want to and then I do not have time 
enough to travel everywhere I dream of (please don't /bonk me, I 
really make some efforts).

As a conclusion, please excuse my weird english language writing. I 
am a Frenchie and if I understand quite well what you all write 
(and I have several dictionnaries too ;)) I can wonder my posts are 
not always very clear.
Then if you do not understand me, please simply shout it, I will 
try to do some more beautiful sentences.

Thanks again, I wish a happy hunting & travelling for all of you, 
EQ players and "I'll be back" with some more candid questions! :)
