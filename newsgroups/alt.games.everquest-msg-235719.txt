"insanely useful"?  Allows monks to pull again in some situations
(where there are pairs of mobs) ... haven't been able to do that in
LDoN because feign-pulling is tooooo slow.

Will probably tick off the paladins though (have a pally alt so I feel
this too) as the level cap (on the highest level pacify) is up to 65
not 55 as with pacify.

Does anyone know if the training manuals are available in the library
yet?
