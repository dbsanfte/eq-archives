Any one in a good guild could solo fairly well. The equipment required comes
from raiding but after you acquire that equipment it is trivial to solo with
it. Of course if you raided already the incentive to solo is significantly
less. I enjoy grouping in hard areas far more than I will ever enjoy soloing
or raiding, but solo with ease I can.

If I wanted a solo game I would be playing angband, or a good first person
shooter.
