I asked you a simple question, and this is essentially your response.  Okay,
I'll go with it and ask you this then.  Here's an example.

I'm a level one in a not-yet-released MMORPG wandering around near my home
city, looking for something to help me get to level two.  In this MMORPG,
the entire playerbase has been divided up into a number of different realms
for a wonderful fulfilling RvR encounters that the game is based around.  So
I'm wandering around near my home city.  Suddenly, out of the bushes springs
a level 20, he yells "For Byzantine!", swipes me with his greatsword and
kills me in one round.  (Or I hear from the distance "For Byzantine!", and
immediately get headshot by an arrow and killed by a level 20 I never even
saw)  As best as I was able to determine, he was Byzantium, a rival realm,
and since I was from Castile, it's perfectly within the RvR rules for him to
come around and kill me like that.  I'm his enemy, after all.

So the Byzantine archer/warrior hangs around outside this city of Castile
for several hours, ganking every single level 1-4 who wanders out, shoutng
"For Byzantine!" each time.  If we call in reinforcements from Castile who
might actually stand a chance against him, he vanishes.

Apparently, this *exact same circumstance that was earlier defined as the
worst of "random ganking"* is perfecly okay, because it was clothed in the
garb of RvR, and hence had a purpose.

Is this your ideal world, Ben?  If it isn't, please clarify to me what
exactly is wrong with my scenario, and remember, it's NOT that I don't
understand you, it's that you're turning out to be completely incompetent in
explaining yourself.  That's the way it's been through this whole thread,
Ben.
