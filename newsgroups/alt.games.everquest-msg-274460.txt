You might want to try Second Life.  It's not much of a game per se
(though apparently some people build games in it), but the character
customisation possibilities are endless.  It's great fun (the
character customisation bit, that is, I didn't get beyond that), and
has a free trial (and only costs $9.95US for unlimited access if you
skip the extras).
