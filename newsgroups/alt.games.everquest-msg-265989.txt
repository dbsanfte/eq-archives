It's true; generational evolution didn't help AC2, and many people still 
believe that UO was the best of them all. But there are features in both WoW 
and EQ2 that have raised the bar for MMORPGs (e.g., rich quest management) 
that do move the genre forward. Doesn't make them good games in and of 
themselves, but it sure helps.
