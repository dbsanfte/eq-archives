No, but the minute you move the transaction to involving goods or
tender outside the game environment, you've soiled the game. It's like
steroids in sports: You're using outside resources to grant an edge
in-game without having to work for that edge yourself.

The rules of the game on this matter are clear. Violating those rules
to give yourself an edge is cheating. As far as your "time being too
precious to spend farming plats", yeah, join the club. I've never gone
out specifically to farm plat, yet I have a decently equipped
character. I play the game, I don't pay other people to play it for
me. If you don't have the time to play this game yourself, then go
find another game that you DO have time to play. Cheating isn't
justified by "I'm too busy to do it the long way".
