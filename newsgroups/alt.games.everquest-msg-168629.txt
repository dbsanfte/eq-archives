It's become more of a "grit your teeth and finish it" quest for me now.
I know there's better stuff out there that we can pick up in the bazaar
once we save up a couple hundred plat. (I'm up near two hundred already
and have more ling silks and other hot items to put on trader soon.) But
I started the damned thing and now I want to finish it. 

Last night I got the breastplate. I finally got the Minotaur scalp.
Could never find more than one or two minotaurs up in any given couple
of hours. Was pissing me off. Then... BINGO! The light goes on over my
head.

"Hey... stupid. You want Minotaurs? Maybe you should try the MINOTAUR
CAVE."

Doh.

Still need at least four drops from brownies between Tarra and I though,
and that's going to be the killer.
