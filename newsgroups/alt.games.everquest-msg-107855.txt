Actually no it dosent . You dont normally have to figure in resists since
they are level accross the board for most nukes. Unfortunately some nukes
just wont behave and follow the rules. If you figure in the resists you get
and the non partial ability you will find that over time scoriae has a
better ratio.

Both ancient starfire and moonfire incidently are ancient spells . Spells
specifically intended to be so rare that only uber guild members will ever
get them and not even all of them. I have seen moonfire drop and so happen
to know that casters realm is wrong. It does 1125 dammage for 325 mana as
well. Incidently the moonfire I saw drop is the only one on our server. If
you ever get a lore spell off an uber mob keep it carefully . It will be
ancient and probably worth a stables worth of chain bridles. They do not
count for discussion purposes any more than my monks lifetaping  golden ulak
count for monk discussions.

Casting time makes close to no diffrence at all in offensive power. Most of
the time it just matters not at all that a spell recycles since you need to
run anyway to gain the distance so the bad guy never gets a chance to whack
you. But even if for some reason you need to burn quickly you mem 2 nukes
not just one and cast them sequentially.

Casters realm is suprisingly usefull for the low to middle game. We however
do not share with them anything that might come back to haunt us. In other
words I know where moonfire drops but casters realm does not.
