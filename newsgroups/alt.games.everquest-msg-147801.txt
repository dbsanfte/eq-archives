Depends on how you put them in:
One stack of 18: does not combine.  (Neither does one stack
    of two or one stack of three, so that's not a change.)
Two stacks of 9:  nine bandages.
Three stacks of 6:  6 cords.

The problem is determining success rate, not determining
what you're trying to make.  Should it do one skill test
or just one?  If it's not trivial, do you get one chance
for a skill increase or many?

And, for obvious reasons, you get problems with anything
that exceeds one stack in output.  If you put in one
stack of batwings and one stack of fresh fish, you might
get two stacks of fish rolls, for instance.  And you
can't hold two stacks at once.

Still, I think all people who do tradeskills would be happy
with multiple combines even with limitations:  one chance
for a skill-up, one check to see if it worked, never get
more than one stack, etc.

Maybe at some point, but I don't see it as a priority.  If
nothing else, the time it takes is more time playing which,
over months, adds up to more money for them...
