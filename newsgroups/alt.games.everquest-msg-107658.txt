    When I was those levels, it was Naltron/Marzin on anyone who attracted
significant aggro as part of their job, and Pinzarn on the rest. Using
Pinzarn on people like mages and rogues gives them protection (which they do
need) while saving you a boatload of cash.

    See how the group is doing loot. If you aren't getting enough loot to
cover expenses, start looting everything that drops. You med less, and their
pulls slow doing that? You betcha - their price to pay for being
dysfunctional and not trying to make sure you're paid for costs incurred to
keep them alive. I remember one group that was really bad in Sebilis - the
melees would loot stuff within five seconds of it hitting the ground. So I
loaded up my loot hotkey and went to work. One of them even remarked (after
I beat them to looting yet another Gangrenous PH) "Damn, you sure loot
fast." "Yup, when I see the melees looting everything that hits the ground
it sharpens my looting reflexes!" They stopped the power looting after
that - guess my hotkey skillz were too great for them. :-)

    When I play my rogue, I want *a* symbol, but it doesn't have to be the
most expensive one available to the cleric. And I'll always fork over the
cash gems when they drop and I loot them. When I play my warrior, I want the
best symbol available, and again, if a gem (and specifically a gem, not the
non-stackable JC stuff) drops I trot over to the cleric and hand it over.
