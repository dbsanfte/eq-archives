Actually, the game was good for me from about a week after launch until 12.6. 
For whatever reasons I had no performance issues in that time.

The game itself worked fine for me, I took a break because AO seems to lack the
undefined "it" that kept me playing UO and EQ like an addict.  I may have also
taken a break because my internal clock rang the "time to play strategy games"
alarm in my lower psyche.  This happens once or twice a year.
