    Well, my warrior was born with a full set of bronze and fine steel
weapons, so I'm not sure that she counts. But she did farm spiders whenever
she saw them in Butcherblock. Green stuff doesn't really hurt that much, and
BB spiders were greening out even at level 6 IIRC. But the $24,000 question
is this: do you have the patience and desire to farm green mobs for cash
loots when you're that low in level. If you don't, oh well, muddle forwards.
If you do, you can go to The Bazaar and buy gear that will last you until
the low 50's at least.
