When I first started playing the game, I thought the same thing.  It's not a
bad idea, but it could be a little depressing and overwhelming to see the
actual number expecially at higher level.  You need 160,750 Exp points to
get the next level. Each MOB gives you 21pts. EEEEK. I think I might just
give up. Now, where I agree completely is in the area of skills.  This
awful, feeble, very bad, bad stuff is just silly.

That said, I am here to tell you that levels 10-15 are difficult.  I never
wanted to complain cuz there are people here that have spent months making a
single level at 50+.  Kinda doesn't go over too well.  But anyway, I feel
your pain.  They are tough for several reasons.  Safe zones have completely
greened out so you have to move on.  The next level zones usually include
lots of higher level wandering MOBs and other MOBs that will aggro when you
are fighting.  You are now farther from your bind point and dying is a big
pain.  Also at these levels you do not yet have the extra skills that make
you powerful within your class, but the MOBs are getting harder to kill.

Finding a group at this level is tough.  Most people are used to running
around a newbie ground killing everything in sight.  When you do get a group
most of them will REALLY SUCK.  They will be full of people that wander off
to fight whatever they see, get lost from the group, go AFK, run back to
sell every 5 minutes or just don't know what they are doing.

Also, I noticed that you are a rogue. (just like me) A rogue is NOT a good
soloing class.  At lower levels you can slash a bat as easily as the next
person, but as you grow your skills really depend on a group for success.
If you are limited in time and cannot play in groups consistently you might
consider playing a class that is better at soloing.  Druids, Necros and
Shamans are all good soloing classes.

Lastly, try the Qeynos sewers.  This is a great zone at your level and you
may be able to solo there.  Enter through the secret entrance in front of
Qeynos.  Hug the left wall all the way to the secret wall (with the Qeynos
Aqueduct sign) This area has thugs and smugglers that are good exp. at your
level. They do not aggro or create trains.  There are no wandering MOBs that
will aggro and best of all this zone is almost always empty so there is no
fighting over campsites.  Get a map from EQAtlas and never EVER enter the
area where the Necro and SK guilds are.  Also, don't kill beggars because
this will ruin your faction in Qeynos.

Good Luck
