The low level chanter pet is fairly pathetic for tanking but does decent
dammage. Either way though you should probably avoid using it. After 20 or
so just use the level 4 mez nuke run mez nuke run mez. The mana cost on the
level 4 mez is low and running will give you time for your nuke to cycle
anyway.

If you want to play with a pet , start learning around lvl 34 on spectres.
They move slow and it is easy enough to break a spawn of 4 in oot or oasis.
Just charm one let the others kill it charm another let them kill it . Charm
the 3rd and kill the other one. Break your charm and use the mez nuke method
on the last one.

Chanters are easy to solo and very powerfull later but you need to learn the
above basic skills. Otherwise you will never get the hang of tash slow and
send in the pet for guardian wurms :) (which is what I solo when im bored)
