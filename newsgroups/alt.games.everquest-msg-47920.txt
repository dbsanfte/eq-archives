Taken from slownewsday.net

I had a moment last week, during one of those late night gaming
sessions, where I sat at the computer at 3 AM, hammering away at the
keyboard and calculating the experience points I was earning against
the number of hours it would take me to reach my goal. I continued to
sit, tired, numb, a bit airy in the mind, simply following the path
the game devs had set down for me. I left the game out of boredom and
typed in the URLs of various gaming websites, looking through the
latest quests, the latest uber loot, and the latest techniques to make
the life of a human leveling treadmill hamster something less than
hell. 
I read the boards, checking out the restrictions and requirements of
certain classes against certain monsters. As I read more and more
about the high-level content that was added to the game, a term
entered my mind: Monty Haul. I remember reading a warning against
Monty Haul campaigns in an old AD&D Dungeon Master�s guide. While any
experienced game master will studiously avoid situations which evolve
into Monty Haul campaigns, game designers seem utterly ignorant of the
phenomenon and its effect on gaming.

The theory behind Monty Haul campaigns is that, the more and more uber
loot, gold, and magic flung at the characters, the less impressed or
interested the players become in a campaign. If you are familiar with
AD&D, think of the T�naari or the Baaetzu. There are two races which
should be difficult for your average adventurer to conquer. However,
by introducing too much uber loot in a campaign, the players blasted
through even the most difficult monsters with nary a glance. 

And so it goes with online gaming. Introduce even more difficult
monsters. Introduce even more uber loot to combat them. Eventually,
the players become so powerful that the only choice is to throw higher
level monsters at them and throw higher level loot which they can
utilize to fight the beasts. While this is well and good for upper
level players, it does little in the way of impressing lower level
characters and newer players to the game. 

Behind gaming, behind the campaigns of role-playing, there was always
a certain level of involvement among players. We like to call them
secondary goals. Whether it was owning a castle, running for mayor, or
ascending to the highest position among a clergy, any good DM knew to
involve his players beyond hack and slash, beyond game mechanics,
beyond looking for a Strength 23 bracelet over a Strength 22 one. 

Playing Asheron�s Call, I find myself involved in nothing more than a
leveling treadmill and endless quests for uber loot that will enable
me to defeat higher-level monsters which give me, you guessed it, even
more uber loot to fight even more difficult monsters. 

Basically, that is the entire premise of the game. Level endlessly,
acquire loot which allows you to level some more, which allows you to
acquire even more loot, which . . . you get the idea, I think. 

This plays on the slot machine mechanics of casino gambling. Each
monster you fight, in hopes of gaining that uber loot, rests on a
certain addiction. �Just one more monster, then I�ll quit. Just one
more level. Just one more skill.� 

Here�s the thing, though. If you�ve ever spent a lot of time in a
casino and lost a lot of time and money, you�ll realize that it isn�t
very fun after awhile. Sure, there is always that first night where
the excitement and enticement of the unknown drives the mystery, the
exhilaration of experiencing something new and wondering about the
possibilities. Eventually, there�s a certain mindlessly driven
addiction psychology involved. 

I find myself fighting mobs because I need just two more levels to
gain mana conversion. I find myself fighting that one more mob,
because maybe, just maybe, there will be a SiK or singularity key or
diamond shield. Just maybe there will be that big payoff. 

The difference between gaming and slot machines is that I only spend
$10 on my game a month. If I had to gamble real money on a slot
machine, I�d quit after a while because I would be out of money.
However, especially for the younger adults who populate online gaming,
time is nothing. We can sacrifice our time. We can gamble it away with
nary a blink. What is two or four or six or twelve hours of our young
lives for the chance to earn the latest uber sword or uber magic item?
It�s nothing to us. I�m 22. I have nothing but time on my hands. 

However, this psychology wears thin. The rat and pellet scenario can
only work for so long. Right? Right?! Well, no. A study of EverQuest
is a study in Skinnerian psychology. It�s all about the rat and the
pellet. It�s all about people and the endless pulling of that slot
machine lever. 

I�m not much interested in this in an online game. I have figured,
through various solo leveling techniques, that it will take me 16
hours to reach a certain goal. A goal which is a mere two levels away.
Here�s a hint: Spending 16 hours in the same dungeon, fighting the
same monsters is not exactly my idea of a good time. I have no
enthusiasm for it. Sure, it�s only two levels, and if I actually sit
down for a weekend, I might be able to reach it. However, I don�t want
to spend a weekend stuck at my computer, clicking the same buttons
over and over, performing the same buffs, buying the same comps,
selling the same things. 

Is there anything else in this game for me, other than killing more
monsters and finding more loot? Anything at all? 

The sad answer is; No, there is not. 

And, looking at the future leveling treadmill that is DaoC, I despair.
I will play DaoC. Why? Because I write for a rant site, and the only
way to write about a game with an accurate perspective is to have
played the game thoroughly. However, with my limited experience in
DaoC, I have caught wind of a leveling treadmill. I entered the game,
saw the leveling treadmill and ran in terror. 

Online games need to offer more. It is a sad testament to the second
generation of MMOGs that UO still has the most in-depth and effective
systems for avoiding the leveling monotony. 

UO had the right idea. Create a world, give the world certain tools
with which the playerbase could be creative with, and let the world
evolve with the evolution of the players. Right now, too many games
depend on the evolution stream that the devs dictate. �You will level.
When you�re this level, you�ll do this. When you reach this level, you
will get this loot, and you will fight these monsters. Then, you�ll go
over here and do this. You have no choice. This is just what you do.� 

Where is the freedom? Where is the choice? Where is the opportunity to
let the players become creative and flesh out the online world in ways
the devs could never dream of? 

Well, that world is still in UO. Even now, playing my leveling and
uber loot gathering account in AC, I yearn for the freedom and
creativity UO afforded its playerbase. 

Looking at the current games, they seem to follow the same old uber
level, uber loot, uber mob philosophy. 

Which is great if you wish to create that casino slot-machine type
addiction among players. 

But, it�s really not much fun.
