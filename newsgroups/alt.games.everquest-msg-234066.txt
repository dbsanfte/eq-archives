And the original poster should hush or they might make it so casters
start with only one spell slot and would gain the additional slots as
they level.  Oh - and like D&D, the spells they were able to mem would
be 8 level 1 spells, 7 level 2, etc.  Oh -- and like D&D they would
lose the spell right after they cast it forcing them to "sleep" then
re-mem that spell before they could use it again.  

I can see it now:
Level 65 wizard: "I'm out of high level nukes, casting some of my
level one spells. "Burst of Flame" incoming!
