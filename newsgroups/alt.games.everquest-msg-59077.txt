Attempting to employ any strategy after you're under attack is a
pretty clear sign of poor planning. 

The 'out of nowhere' would indicate that you were woefully unprepared,
which is an act deserving of (virtual) annihilation.

Not if your opponents are bright enough to realize that they're
engaging in a war simulation and have made some preparations.

These kinds of battles are *never* unfair, because everyone
participating in them starts equal. *Both* side are operating under
the same game rules, and *both* sides have the same opportunity to
prepare, plan and execute an attack. Both sides are likewise able to
set up defenses.


Anyone who whines because harsh tactics have been used against them
needs to reconsider what they really want to be doing with their
leisure time.
