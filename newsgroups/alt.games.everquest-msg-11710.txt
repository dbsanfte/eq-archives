Just a few reminders :) This was before Kunark. Warrior would be wearing 
an FBSS, an almost complete set of Indo and wielding 2 yaks.
Shaman would be wielding gatorsmash maul, and have the same skill at it 
as the warrior did with the yaks (i.e. 200). Shaman would have very 
comparable AC to the warrior, and would be regenerating insane amounts 
of health per tick (around 40, if I remember right). They would have 
almost the same hitpoints. Shaman would have higher strength, allowing 
him to hit his magic number consistently.
So, pretty much, it's the double attack of the warrior against the 
insane regeneration of the shaman
