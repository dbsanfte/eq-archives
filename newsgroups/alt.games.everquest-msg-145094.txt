Just a warning about the Grimlings, if they take the Owlbear Camp then the
Soldiers that spawn there (High 20's -30) can hit for 80dam, that's on a 52
Warrior and have high magic Resist.

I didn't find them particularly good loot, mainly killed them for the name
ones who drop some nice items. Some of it sells real well too (3k earing off
of Gnurn Noeyes) but as I found most of it a nice improvement or alternative
to what I had I kept practically everything I looted (some of it is no drop
as well)
