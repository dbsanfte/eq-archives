Patchwork? Luxury!!

We used to have to get up, half an hour before we went to bed, don our
cloth armour, walk to work (uphill *both* ways), work down the mines of
Nurga for 25 hours a day *and* pay t'mine owner for t'privilege. We'd
come 'ome - we lived in a cooking pot at the bottom of Lake Rathe) - and
eat a handful of cold elven trail mix for us tea, then our Dad would
come 'ome, PK us, and dance about on our spawn point singing the
Hallelujah chorus.

Tell that to players of today - they won't believe you!
