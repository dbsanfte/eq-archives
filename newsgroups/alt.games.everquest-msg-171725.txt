I'd sort of agree on the hold aggro part.   Although I'd define sub-par
haste as being FBSS level.  20%~ish.   Even with 40 percent haste, the same
as most other classes will have, a warrior already has the hardest time
maintaining aggro of all the tank classes.  We need every edge we can get.

Don't ask me what the mez comment means though.  Heh. ; P

Oh, and VoG is twice as long as WR, not "over 4 times"...  42 minutes
compared to 20.5, before AA / focus effects.
