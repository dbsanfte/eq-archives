When the game first started, newbies would start with a "Tome of Discord".
That is probably the book you are talkinga bout.  Newbies no longer start
out with that book.  You have probably seen the "priest of discord"...
basically, if you wanted to be considered "player versus player", you would
have handed that book to him.. your name would have turned red and you would
then play everquest by different rules.  You no longer have to deal with
that :).  What server are you playing on?
