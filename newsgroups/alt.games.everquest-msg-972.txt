I have an Iksar Necro who is KOS to the Dark Elf Clerics.  I can raise
the other Dark Elf factions, but are there any ways to raise the
PriestsofInnoruuk ?

There are 3 cleric quests, but I can't really do them since i'm already
KOS and the quests involve giving items to the trainer or guildmaster.

The main reason I need to raise the faction is because there's a dark
elf Cleric in the Freeport Necro guild and while i'm not kos to the
humans, she will run out and hit me for 100 hp through the wall.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Thanks.
