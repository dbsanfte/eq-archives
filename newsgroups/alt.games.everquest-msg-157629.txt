Paladul Caverns from 1 to 26, from 22 to 26 you are going to be fighting for
pulls from the bandit camps, but if you go during off peak hours, really
late at night/early morning, then it should be fine.  The experience is
better the kurns in my mind and again the beetles, and phlargs don't run.

Dawnshroud has great experience in my mind, the small zelniaks have low hit
points but do run.

Another good place is Eastern Wastes on the north side at the fort.  Pulling
kodiaks and such in the 30's is really good experience.

Spiders in Nurga, if you can fear, they are easy kills.

Lower Guk from 40 to 47ish...

Pail Ryder.
