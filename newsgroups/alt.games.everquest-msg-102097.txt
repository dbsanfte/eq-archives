Yep, went and tried it. Same jagged pine treefolk as gnolls. The
difference is that these druids are a bit rough on a dark elf cleric
of 39, even a twinked one. She expends all of her mana nuking a couple
and the nuke too much for her to melee them really, though they are
easy. My 36 sk troll could mow them down non stop in melee but they
are hard for her alone. She went back to the gnolls when it was busy
today and killed a bunch her self and used her innoruk symbol neck
thingie to snare all the other ones people were fighting for faction.
For a dark elf cleric of inny her factions are pretty funky now.

I've been using the halfling form one use thing a lot and getting a
druid to wolf me sometimes. I'm now amiable to druids in surefall in 
halfling or wolf form while still threaten in dark elf form to
protectors and dubious to them in halfling. With wolf or halfling and
a passerby camoing me on the turn in, I did turn in talym shoontar's
and some poacher heads for a bunch of good factions at the ranger
guild. Its really pretty slow going since there is no kill for that
ranger faction, I kind of need a wolf former parked there while I do
the nestif's quest over and over but I don't know anyone who'd want to
sit there that long.

Guards of qeynos, the paladin guild and the cleric guild of qeynos are
all max allied now (they can't get any higher ;)  ) And bloodsabres,
the sewer qeynos cleric and necro guild, can't get any worse ;) since 
I took SO many faction minuses to it with bone chips while also
killing Tovax, the necro in qeynos hills, a bunch.  I am opposite dark
elf!

I also just got non kos with the qeynos int casters guild finally.
Brought 80 batwings from EC at the erud vendor and the one use
halfling mask. Bought 60 or so snake skins and rat whiskers from
various qeynos vendors then did the unsars calling quest (Unsar guy
back around in the casters area. Was dubious in halfling form to them 
and he wants one snake scale, one rat whisker and 2 bat wings. By the
time I ran out of bat wings I was amiable in halfling form but only
dubious in dark elf. At least I'm non kos to all of surface qeynos
now, have great merchant, pally, guard, priests of life faction. I'm
even up to apprehensive to the corrupt guards from doing jenam and
rebby so much in freeport.

That halfling form mask is great when you don't have someone around to
share wolf form. I just wish it never ran out of charges or was more
like 5 or 10.
