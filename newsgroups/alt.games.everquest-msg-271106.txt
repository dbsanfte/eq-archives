That doesnt' make sense, you by no means have to leave due to lack of 
these, after all, the issued weapons and their upgrades don't require 
ammo anyway.

Thing is, lots of fun seeming weapons drop, and even though they tend to 
be less effective than the upgraded issue weapons, it would be fun to 
play around with them; its just impossible to do so.

Worse, this isnt' true of the melee weapons, so it only discriminates 
against ranged weapon users... if the point of not having ammo is to 
force people to leave (even though I don't see how it does so) then 
you'd think melee weapon professions wouldn't leave at all!

I've come to the conclusion that the answer to "when to leave" is "when 
you have all the good gear: your nano kit, a full set of badged 
newcommer armor, and your weapon loadout (best option seems to be a SMG 
and adventurer's pistol).  After that, there's no particular reason to 
stay, and you can get much better missions and more reliable loot in the 
real world.  I fondly remember a few days ago when I first started, when 
the boss mobs weren't all nearly constantly camped, -then- staying for a 
few more levels was worth doing, as they are decent exp and drop 6 or so 
items each kill, pretty sweet.

Nowadays, though, that doesn't seem to be an option, camping mentality 
has come to the game.
