I have been looking at this item too for my new cleric.

He is currently 17, being powerlevelled by a 47 chanter (using
memblur). But if the little cleric could atone/memblur himself, it
would be much easier/faster to PL with my 60 warrior, until he reaches
40 so they can group - which, of course, is the only purpose of the
baby cleric to begin with...

So, is 34 the lowest level a cleric can memblur/atone, even with this
sprinkler?

Thanks.
