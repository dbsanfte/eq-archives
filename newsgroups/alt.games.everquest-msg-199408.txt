Friends,

I know the KEI issue has been beaten to death, but I have a serious
problem and I need some advice. First, a little background�

I have three mains: 52 Warrior, 52 Cleric, and 53 Enchanter. Lately,
all three have been spending time in KC. (One at a time. I don't multi
box.)

When I play my Cleric, it is typically without clarity of any kind � I
absolutely refuse to solicit KEI. Of course, if there is an Enchanter
in the group, I'll get clarity of some form or another. But usually,
it's all me. My Cleric is pretty gimp with a standing wis of 190.
Without any clarity, I have little trouble keeping up with heals.
There is sometimes a bit of extra down time between pulls, but rarely
anything major. If there is a backup healer in the group � even a
Paladin or Ranger � virtually no down time. If there is an Enchanter,
no down time at all.

(Actually, I did solicit KEI once. The stench still won't wash off.
Oh, I've had KEI a few times. I'd be in an XP group and look up and
notice I had it. Drive by, I guess. Or, a couple of times, when
running from PoK to the bazaar, I'd get to the bazaar and notice I had
KEI. Must have run through a MGB or something. And once I grouped with
a 60th level Enchanter. He naturally KEI'd the group. I've rezzed a
60+ Enchanter here and there and they like to give KEI as a donation.
Strangely enough, my Warrior has had KEI more than both my Cleric and
Enchanter combined.)

Lately, there has been another Cleric in KC I've seen quite a bit.
I've grouped with her with my other characters. She always has KEI. I
take exception to her healing practices. If the main tank drops to
about 55% hp, CH. If anyone else drops to 80% hp, celestial. (My motto
is "If everyone has 100% hp, the Cleric is wasting mana".) She will
not play without KEI. When KEI drops, it's off to PoK to get it
refreshed. In the mean time, the rest of the group just stands around
waiting for her to get back. I find this extremely inconsiderate �
especially when I'm playing the Enchanter. Clarity is just not good
enough for her. It has to be KEI. One time, I happened to be logged as
my Cleric and we two were in the same group � two Clerics. When her
KEI ran out, same thing: Off to PoK for a new one. I didn't have KEI
and keeping the whole group healed by myself would have been no
problem. But she, as one of two Clerics, felt it necessary to have
KEI. She's 54th level and rides a horse (i.e. rich), so I know she has
a higher mana pool than my 52nd gimp Cleric.

And it's not just inconsiderate. I think it makes incompetent Clerics
(and probably other classes as well). If you are CHing at 55% hp and
casting celestial at 80% hp, you'll soon be out of mana. If this is
her normal practice, no wonder she can't play without KEI. I'm sure
this is true for the whole "next generation" of casters coming up who
have lived their whole lives with KEI.

Anyways, the last time I was in a group with her (happened to be with
my Enchanter) and she ran off for KEI, I told the group (her included)
that I felt that putting the whole group on hold to go get KEI was
very inconsiderate and that I could not tolerate it and left the
group.

The thing is, people leaving the group to go get KEI has gotten to the
point that it really pisses me off. I'm not talking about being a
little annoyed. I mean really pissed off. I don't want to be in a
group with the person getting the KEI. Sometimes, I get so angry I
have to log and go kick the cat until I cool off. I'm a very easy
going kind of person. I typically don't get very angry at anything.
Right now, in my life, nothing angers me more than an XP group member
taking of to refresh KEI. Not my job, not taxes, not the French,
nothing. Just thinking about it writing this post is pissing me off.

What can I do about this? I enjoy playing Everquest, but as soon as
someone wants to take a trip to PoK to refresh KEI (and it's happening
more and more these days) I just want to reach through the computer
and strangle them. Should I just grit my teeth and bear it?

And about my own personal boycott of KEI: I know that sometimes my not
having KEI slows down the group and I feel bad about it. Should I just
suck it up and get with the program? I don't want to be one of those
total mother fucking assholes who leaves their XP group hanging to go
refresh their KEI. And there's also the cost. On my server, KEI goes
for 25-50pp. None of my characters has ever seen 1000pp at one time.
While 50pp is no great burden, it is definitely felt. My Cleric is
already spending a small fortune on periodots. Do I just add the cost
of KEI as more "cost of doing business"?

I also find it irksome that Sony could easily remedy the situation by
simply reducing the duration of KEI to an hour or less.

Oh well, that's it. Comments welcome.
