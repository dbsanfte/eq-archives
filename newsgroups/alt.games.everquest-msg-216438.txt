Nonsense.  If a mob is doing 2K damage per 30 seconds, and you CHeal tank one for
7K, but tank 2 for 2K, then you will be CHealing that second tank a lot more
often.  THe only time when you can say both heals are identical is when tank B
has so much better mitigation that he takes only 2K damage in the time tank A
takes 7K damage.  This was once the case with monks, which is what made them the
best tanks in the game for chain killing low blues with a healer behind them.
But its not the case of rangers versus warriors, not by a long shot.

Aha, but thats the arguement; there are cases where the magician is the better
puller.  Thats all.  Only for 10 minutes?  Only because he's the highest level?
Only because he has the longest range pull?  Only doesn't matter, if there's even
one case, then the statement that there are NO cases where its true is false.
Nobody is trying to prove that this is normally the case, in fact the reason I
brought up magician puller in the first place was precisely because as a rule
they are the last choice for the job, but even they, even Then I say, are
sometimes the best.  Normally, I'd go with a monk.

If Z is the amount of mana needed for everyone to survive under normal
situations, then Z*2 or Z*3 may be needed for disasters.  Your operating theory
seems to be that if Z is good for normal pulls, its good for "oops we got twice
as many mobs as normal" for "uh oh the SK went LD" for "dammit why didn't the
enchanter say he was going AFK in group instead of just telling the cleric" or
for any of a half dozen other unexpected turns of events.

My point isn't that we Need 3 times what we normally need, its that 80M is a good
substantial mana point, that keeping an average higher than that runs us up
against the FM barrier, but that if we stay vaguely around 80M then we'll almost
never hit FM and waste mana regen, and we'll have all the mana we can reasonably
expect for any disaster without paying that cost of wasted regen.

If the normal mana fluxuation is even less than 10M we could go up to 90M, if its
larger than 20M we might want to center a bit lower... but I doubt it since that
means that Z is actually pretty big, and Z*2 or Z*3 could easily run us out of
mana if our pool is low.
