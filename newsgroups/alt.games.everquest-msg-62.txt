Thus far I've only seen them refered to as blue bubs.

I wouldn't substitute bubblette or mini-bubble for this,
as there's no savings in typing, and niether seems as
clear as blue bub...

Now that I consider it, though, there seems to be
no reason to use the word bub.

I am four blues from leveling

Oops, yes there is, as blues also refer to a mob level,
and at 40, you'd better believe I'm not getting a full
blue bub for any blue mob out there!
