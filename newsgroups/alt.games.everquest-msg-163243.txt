I have a Stein of Moggok. Forgot to mention that one of my other alts is a
lvl 9 DE Enchanter (didn't list him, because I don't use him much, except to
make jewelry). I did the Stein of Moggok quest 3 times: Once to get one for
the Druid who helped me with the quest (He needed one to twink his Wizard),
a second time to get one for my main, and a third time to get one for my
Chanter.

If it was feasible, I'd just keep doing the quest over and over again,
selling the Stein each time, then buy the damned GBS. But it isn't. I have
PoP, so I could get around the various quest places quite easily (except for
OOT, for the Kiola Nuts) . The sticking point is that I can't do the Qeynos
portion by myself; I have the maximum of 8 characters (some are abandoned
alts that I kept around in case I ever get the urge to play them again that
I now use as storage toons), but none who I'd want to risk killing their
Qeynos faction.
