Thanks for all your help guys.  i went to eq atlas to find the way there,
then i found that there are only 5 songs there, so i managed to scrounge up
enough money to buy all of them cuz it was a long run and i didn't want to
have to go back.  then i just stuck everything i owned in the bank and
killed myself to save a little time.  kinda like gate only without the
casting....
