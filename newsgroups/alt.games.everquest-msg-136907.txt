Hijacking this back to the original subject, we went to JP last night. 

Encounter/observation number one: The critters there are all glaring to
start with. And they *will* attack you if you are careless. If you kill
them your faction goes further downhill.

Number two: Those mermaid looking beeyatches in the stream are
apparently the most magic impervious witches ever put in the game. Blue
to both of us (51 wizard and 49 necro) and we could NOT land a snare or
a root on one given about six tries. Then I landed an Ice Comet on her.
For SIX points. woo freaking hoo.

Number three: Finally located the gnoll caves. Was killed inside of two
minutes.

Kind of a rough zone.
