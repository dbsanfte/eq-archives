Here's how I believe it works. I haven't tested all combinations, but so far 
every situation I have tested has confirmed this formula. It's not a fixed 
number, it's a percentage. You will get credit if you are at least 75% of a 
higher level. A level 28 will not get experience with a level 38 (73%) but a 
level 29 (76%) will. Once you hit level 38 you can get experience with 
anyone (76% of 50).
