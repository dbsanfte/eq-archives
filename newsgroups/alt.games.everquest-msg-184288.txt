You are confused.  There were no insults in the post from the person
quitting.  The insults were from the person who copied that post from the EQ
forums at Sony to this newsgroup.

As far as not caring goes, I have noticed that a lot of people who seem to
be good EQ friends don't care about each other outside of EQ.  For example,
there was someone where I work who started playing EQ so much it interfered
with his job.  He took a few sick days, and then simply stopped coming to
work, and stopped answering his phone, and ended up on such a weird schedule
that I wasn't able to catch him online to find out what the hell was going
on.

So, I left a message on his guild's forum.  The reaction from his
guildmates?  Most of them seemed to think that this was the funniest thing
they'd ever heard of.

A couple months later, when the money was running out for him...his EQ
"friends" finally decided he needed help.  His EQ account stopped working
because he couldn't pay, so a guildmate "helped" him by buying him six more
months.

EQ (MMORPGs in general?) is strange, in that people form relationships in
the game that function like real friendships or more, but that aren't, so
that when things are going OK, they diminish real relationships, but when
things go bad, they don't provide the real support or caring that real
relationships do.
