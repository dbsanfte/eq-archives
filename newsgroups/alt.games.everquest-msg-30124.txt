OMG Drool, i have no idea when it would proc. if your level 51 it should
oroc now. i cant think of any weapons that dont proc by level 51. maybe ask
the GM who gave it to you since your the only one to have this weapon and
there may not be any other items that produce this effect if the gm doesnt
tell you it may be up to you to find out when it procs and what it does
