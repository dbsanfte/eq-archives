One of the better combos I've run across is ranger/cleric.

Once she hits level 9, you are a potent force; ranger pulls
(track means always finding prey at just the level you were
looking for) and snares, you fear and handle needed
healing, and you make quick work of just about any
outdoor mob.

Ranger/Necromancer might be even better, since the
healing duties are relatively light and a necro can contibute
a bit more damage to each fight with fewer mana problems.
I've never had the pleasure of trying this out, though.
