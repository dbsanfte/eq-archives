There are enough players at the 50+ level range to support one, maybe
two, pickup group dungeons.

Exactly how is Verant supposed to change this? If they add zones that
are harder than the existing ones, they stay unused. If they make them
easier, then the existing ones empty out.  

The 'problem' is that a pickup group zone becomes more attractive the
more groups there are in it. The more groups, the more chance of someone
leaving a group and you getting to replace them. 

This works both ways, if you don't have people coming it to replace
missing members, the group will split up before it hits the break-even
point.
And with noone else in the zone, there is noone to res your cleric if
they die, translocate you out if you have no wizard, etc.

Without a radical change to the way people get into groups (say a
separate group forming zone from which you could port to anywhere), the
best available choice is probably a single mega-dungeon that can support
100+ people.

And then people will complain there is only a single zone they can get a
group in...
