FWIW, the good news that casters may no longer have to stare at
the spellbook while medding has convinced me to keep my account.

I was ready to cancel it because I felt any game that forced me
to look at a static screen (the spellbook) *more* than I actually
get to see the game world seemed absolutely insane to me.

The first time it really hit home was when I Was showing off EQ
to a friend who commented (paraphrased), "Gosh, all you ever do
in this game is look at your spellbook."
