> But you don't need smithing to do the Shawl Quest...

In theory, no.

But to get over 158 tailoring you WILL need smithing.
If you can make cultural armor, you need around 100 to make the studs and
bonings, and around 150 to make the cultural sewing kit.

If you cant do cultural you need to make velium studs and bonings, and with
the temper costing 35pp a piece you dont wanna be too low there, think its
trivial at around 100, but 150 would be a good idea to minimize the
failures.

And tailoring before 100, depending on the stuff you make, the materials
you have access to, can involve making bonings and studs.
