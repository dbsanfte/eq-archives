I don't remember where I got it but I got my 8500 for $130 a month or two
ago. Please note that while I had exactly zero problems with it a lot of
people say that the card is hopeless in EQ (less than 10 fps). It does look
better than the GeForce 4, don't care if it's a little slower.
I have a P3-766 with a VooDoo 5 that does a decent job.

DaveO:You may want to try to lower the clipping plane a bit. Also, if you
are on win98 check out Mr. Langer's advise. Win 98 doesn't play well with
more than 512 MB (Mr. Gates did it to us again... first 640k, now 512MB
sigh)
Other things to check: If you have a non Intel chipset on your computer
(start, settings, control panel, system, device manager, click on the + next
to system devices, look for something like VIA Tech or ALi CPU to PCI Bridge
If you have that you might want to go look up the latest motherboard
drivers. Install them. (can make a massive difference, believe me.) Then go
get DirectX 8.1 and reinstall it.
Then get the recommended drivers for your video card off of the video card
matrix on EQ's site (sorry I don't have the url handy). and install them.
Also download and reinstall your sound card drivers.

Actually, let me revise the above. Go get everything FIRST. Then do the
installs in order: MB driver, DirectX, Video, Sound.
In your video card control panels (I know nVidia has a halfway decent set of
panels) turn off anti aliasing. It doesn't add much and probably eats your
cards power alive.
