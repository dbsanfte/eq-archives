I've noticed.

Picture yourself near a stream.
Birds are singing in the crisp, cool mountain air.
Nothing can bother you here.
No one knows this secret place.
You are in seclusion from that place called the world.
The soothing sound of a gentle waterfall fills the air with
a cascade of serenity.
The cool water is fresh and clear.
You can easily make out the face of the person whose
head you are holding under the water.
There now, feeling better?
