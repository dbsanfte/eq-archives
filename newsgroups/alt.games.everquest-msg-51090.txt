No it's not that they cannot afford to pay, it's that why should they?
The supply is an ever increasing quantity while the demand is a
constant. That means price drops.

Anyone insulting the california public school system sucks. The reason
our education system sucks is 1) multiple guess tests instead of
oral/fill in the balnk/essay tests, 2) Locality based funding for
schools instead of state wide pooled averages.
