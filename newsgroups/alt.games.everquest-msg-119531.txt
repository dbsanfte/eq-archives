Not for certain...Something along the lines of more authority, they get to
do certain things without having it approved by someone else higher up then
them (sometimes normal guides need to have things approved by senior/GMs)...

Is this question geared towards you wanting to be a senior guide or just as
a player curious as to what they can do for me?
