As off topic as this is I cant resist.
You mean one type of body tissue magically changes to another? This is
indeed news as if we could discover the secret of this transformation
all of us fatties could be arnolds in a matter of weeks. Oh my but
that isn't what happens is it? What happens is the calorie intake
remains high and they start burn less and less calories as they age.
Muscles lose definition as fat increases due to lowered metabolism.
Basically the same thing that happens to everyone.
