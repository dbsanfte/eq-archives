Hehe, I don't know if you misread it or what, but I had the Combine Outpost
on my list, but I called it the Autumn Valley, because it looks like it is
in eternal autumn.
Likewise, I had the E/N Karana bridge on there, hehe.

But I completely forgot ToFS, and didn't even know about the colossus
(although I would guess it looks a lot like the Warslik's statues)
