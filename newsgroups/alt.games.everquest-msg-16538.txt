I have not seen it fail, but have seen it not work. Minor difference,
but it matters. if the Mob is in range and not immune, it works. If
they are immune, or out of AE range, it does not. There have been
times I thought 'those two over there' were Harmonied, when only 1
was, and it ran too close to the other....

Anyone ever figure out what makes things immune? Dervish Thugs are,
and the baby turtle with the unkillable HP's in Iceclad is. Does not
seem to matter if it is red as hell or green as all get out. Some
things just are immune.
