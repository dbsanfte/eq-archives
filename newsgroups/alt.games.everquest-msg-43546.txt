Then again, once in a while it does get up there, especially when there is a
run on ports in FV. For come reason there are few Wizzies prepared to port
out of FV repeatedly, I hear they are all in Velious. I am bound just outside
the bank in FV and enjoy an average of 30-70pp a day in porting income, which
will grow as I gain DL and GD ports, since there is hardly a time on my
server that you don't see someone in WC shouting for a port to one of those
with an offer of 30-50pp, or more.
