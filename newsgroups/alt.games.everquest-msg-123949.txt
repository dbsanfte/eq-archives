Why I left Cobalt Scar.

Wizards training Bulthar Herdleader. (a dry bones skelly has a better hate
list than this guy)
Wizards training Bulthar. (maybe he finished his bulthar quad, but they do
enjoy stopping to smack anyone they see)
Sirens dispelling KEI.  (ok, that was mostly my own fault)
Logging in to 2 wizards and a necro /telling you for SoW/SoE and getting
whined at when you say no (and none of the 3 are withing /target soeplz
range)
Wizards training Wyverns on KoS people with their pullsticks (KoS sit agro >
pullstick agro)
Wizards whining when someone gets agro'd by their pull and they lose part of
their precious quad.
Druids complaining when the Chief attacks them (Wolf Form is KoS to Othmir
you moron) and then training him around.
Level 58+ Monks soloing all the wyvern spawns with no downtime.
Anyone training Azureake or drakes around and catching people in the AoE.
Anyone training haunted chests out of the water onto medding people (KoS sit
agro > KoS proximity agro pulling)
Ebay druids.

Thank god I got my 2 siren hairs, now lets just hope I don't have to go back
for more.
