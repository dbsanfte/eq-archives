OK.

So, I've been wandering around killing things for a while, and my wife
is intrigued enough she might want to try it out. I have the 'gold box
ha ha sucker we saw you coming' edition. Is there any way she can
install from those disks, if we both pay for our monthly accounts
separately? Or do we need a whole new set of disks? Obviously, we'd
like to kill Loda Kai bandits together, sort of a marital bonding
thing. (No, not like that, you sickos!)
