Except for one teensy, tiny thing: I don't have one.  Nor does anybody
I know.  Which does not mean that you're not correct, just that it doesn't
apply in many situations.

My guild is decidedly un-uber.  But with a level 60 rogue, you can get
invited along  on a lot of not-my-guild-but-a-friend's type of raids.
I rarely get loot of any kind on a end-game type of raid (hell, I just
picked
up a Bone Razor from Fear 3 weeks ago...it went to my level 44 rogue
because I 'member when Bone Razor was the shiznit for a rogue before
Kunark and I couldn't stand to see it just sold away).  Which is balanced
out because I not only get to see some of these encounters for when the
rest of my guild or my alt's guild gets up that high I'll have some
experience
there, but from level 55 on I was constently in the KS group and got
the exp for the encounters, anyway ;-).
