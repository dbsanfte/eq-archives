Have you considered buffing the air pets up?  And casting See Invis on the
buffers in order to do so?  Air pets are the premium group pet... yes you
can't time the stun, but adding more stuns to the environment at no mana
cost is simply never a bad thing.  Further, invis they don't have the problem
all other pets do, of aggroing green mobs that would never think of attacking
the party without that pet in there.  In a group, the pet isn't really a good
target for your DS; your party tank will outtaunt pets significantly anyway;
if your air pet does get some attention it isn't a bad thing that it doesn't get
hit all that often.
