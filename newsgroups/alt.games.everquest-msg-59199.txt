Ok, then. 
Buh bye! Enjoy DAoC until you "beat it" three weeks from now. Once
you're done there in December I've got an old copy of Tomb Raider for
your PC that you can have for five bucks. I'll include a list of "cheat
sites" on the web where you can play in "God Mode".  E-mail for details
(I'll also accept a full sleeve of Ritz crackers. But not those generic
Ho-Ho kind, though.)
