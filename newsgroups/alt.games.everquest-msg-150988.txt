Well isent that just a matter of time ?
If we say like this...i got a Ranger he gets Clarity too maby not C3 but the
best he gets is like C2 at lvl 58 and C at 39 who will pay you for a C in
bazaar or Nexus ?
Who needs a chanter at lvl 40 ? ok you can mezz but if they got a bard in
group they dont need ya they get C anyway and a guy/girl with C that can
Tank in worst scenarios.
Did you get mu point ?
