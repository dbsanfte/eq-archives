Yes, but that wouldn't make sense.  With the Skinning Knife, you're making
your own bandages from the flesh of your opponent.  Imagine bandaging your
wounds with Kizdean Gix's own flesh...  I'm not sure whether that's grusome
or just too cool.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
