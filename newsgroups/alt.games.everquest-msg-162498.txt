I've lessened my woes by not having a full duplicate of the default as
my UI. The folder only contains the files I've changed, and the rest
are taken from the default. And since I can see in the patcher when a
default UI file is changed, it's not all that difficult to fix any
changes to my files (Notes: 1. I taught myself how to rewrite the
stuff 2. my UI is world record simplistic)
