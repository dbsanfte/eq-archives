You don't have to sit during the night... Get a torch, fire beetle eye, or
various other light sources to aid you.  You can always start a night vision
class if you want.

As for getting lost, get all the maps from your various zones off
eqatlas.com.  Use your /loc to find your way and keep sense heading up too.
I use may laptop to bring up the maps as I journey but printing them is just
as good.

Sure I have some pp for a new PC... Just haven't found a merchant that sells
one.  Maybe Dell is in Freeport (hehe)
