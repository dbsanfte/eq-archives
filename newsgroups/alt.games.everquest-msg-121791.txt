  I'm not too wise to the item, but since it yields additional information
with the Identify spell (and since it's NO DROP), my guess is that its
primary value lies in its role in some quest, and not in the weapon's stats.

  Because for them to be more common might be overpowering when you take
backstabbing rogues into consideration. ;)  Still, there are a few high
damage backstabbing weapons out there, a lot more of them than there were
before the release of the Velious and Luclin expansions.  Keep your eyes out
for a Sturdy Grimling Mining Pick, a 12/29 1HP weapon whose main flaw is
that it's non-magical, meaning it won't work against the likes of ghouls and
willowisps.  It's a great choice for rogues to use against the majority of
beasts that don't require such a weapon, though.  Bloodstained fangs (which
drop off cougars in Velious) are another good, relatively high damage
piercing weapon (9/32).  Though its damage/delay ratio isn't spectacular, it
is magic, so it's a good backstabbing weapon for a rogue of limited means to
use against ghouls and wisps.  If you keep your eyes open and join your
server's market channel and leave /auction on, you may be able to buy the
both of them for under 100 platinum.
