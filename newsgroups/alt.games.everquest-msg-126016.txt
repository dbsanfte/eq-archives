 Seems you're confusing spell gems with buff icons. I don't have a
problem with the buff icons. They look nice. However, the gems, while
probably being more descriptive as well, pictorially, just look plain
ugly with the non-rounded edges. Perhaps it will look better at actual
resoultion, and I'm sure I wont hate it that much after getting used to
them, but as first glance I don't like them.
