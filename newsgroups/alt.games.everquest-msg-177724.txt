Hi:

I'd be very pleased with some faction advice for the final turn-in for my
Staff of the Four Wizard Epic.

Graffe's is a great source of Wizardly information - however, I'm reading
conflicting views about faction. Here's my situation.

Currently, Solomen cons apprehensively to me, but he does answer when I hail
him.

Kandin Firepot, the Gnome in Butcherblock Mountains also cons apprehensively
but will, like Solomen, talk to me.

According to Graffe's, indifferent faction with Solomen is needed for him to
hand over the Staff of the Four - so I've tried to raise my TrueSpirit
faction - but I'm rather worried I might do more harm than good.

TrueSpirit faction can supposedly be raised by doing a quest in Butherblock
Mountains. Pegleg is to be killed, and I'm then to hail the Lesser Spirit
that pops in Pegleg's place. Sadly though, Pegleg cons threateningly to me,
as does the Lesser Spirit - so I can't do the quest until my faction with
him is raised. Furthermore, Bondl Felligan, the Barbarian involved in this
quest cons apprehensively too!

I've been killing Guard's Gonin and Kyte to raise my faction for Pegleg, but
it's mighty slow going as they only spawn three times per hour.

I've read that I *could* go to East Freeport and kill Jyle Windshot, and my
faction with Pegleg would immediately change to indifferent, but the huge
downside to this is ruining my faction with the Druids - as well as my
Faydark faction. I don't *really* want to do this.

So, is there a way that I might raise my TrueSpirit faction without a
headache of faction ups and downs? Graffe's suggests that I can get my Epic
item by having someone cast invis on me whilst the trade window is open -
but after reading the forum threads I've also seen advice sating not to do
this.

As of this moment I don't have all three staves, I still need Phinny - but
of course, that's the easiest Staff to obtain.

I'm wondering whether the only sure way to raise my TrueSpirit faction is to
hand Camin 1K - as many times as I need - I haven't conned Camin for a
while - I'm hoping to find he's indifferent.

My last question is this: Now I have two parts of my Epic, I could MQ the
Phinny Staff - but what if the person owning the Phinny Staff has faction
issues? Can I still MQ my last item?

Many thanks as always.

Stevie.
