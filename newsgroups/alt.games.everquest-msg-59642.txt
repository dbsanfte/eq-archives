I can answer this question with an firm NO, you can't run EQ under Linux at
all.  DirectX is not implemented for Linux.  And as far as I know, WINE,
VMware and WinLin have no plans to implement DirectX for linux.

Why would you want to play EQ on Linux?  The truth of the mater is...Linux
is a lousy video game platform.  It's an awsome network OS, (in fact,
probably the best network OS,) and does well for scientific and engineering
projects, but theres a lot that has to happen to make a good video game
system.

If you're in need of a network OS, or if you need access to a unix OS for
programming projects, then go ahead and install linux.  (I recomend you use
Redhat or Mandrake instead of SuSE.)  Otherwise, there's not point to
installing linux.
