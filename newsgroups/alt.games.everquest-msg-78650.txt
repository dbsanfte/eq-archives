You sure you can swim faster than a bard can run?  My swimming is in the 
190s, and I still run MUCH faster than I swim.  I run faster than the 
boats, and I've NEVER seen anyone able to even come close to keeping up 
with the boats while swimming.  (This includes the boat to Velious.)

bards aren't best at much, but we'll run away better than anyone, on land, 
water, lava, or air!
