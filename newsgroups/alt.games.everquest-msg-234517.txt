They enforce it as it is presently. The problem is, they aren't
all-seeing and they don't have the time/manpower to go through the
database hunting for bad names. I HAVE seen names get nerfed even as
recently as a couple weeks ago, though. I know I haven't seen
Garrfield (the tiger vah'shir), Braska Yuyevon (Final Fantasy X name),
or Sefiroth around since I petitioned the names...
