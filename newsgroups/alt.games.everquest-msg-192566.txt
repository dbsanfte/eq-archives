Ok this is the most difficult part.  Make 5 of your part and keep asking
people to trade.  Each of the other classes needs to get parts from all the
other classes so they need yours as much as you need theirs.  You could
search for people with a /who all vah.  Problem is, not very many people
care enough about this quest.  When my bard did it he got 3 trades and then
gave up and made an alt to do the last one.  If you go that route you don't
need to level him up at all.  Just get him to the area where things are
killed then do the killing with your main.  Let the alt loot.  It's very
tedious and the weapon I have never used.  The cloak is nice though, and can
be upgraded with further quests.
