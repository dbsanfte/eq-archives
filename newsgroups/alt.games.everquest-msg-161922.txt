Yes, I want Pac Man in eq (You play a warrior chased around BlackBurrow by
gnolls collecting gold coins. Pick up the Aego buff stone to get to attack
the gnolls.)

Or Missile Command. You defend your spawn points against the onslaught of
KS'ers... watch out for the Quad/swarm kiter.. he can wipe out your entire
camp.

Or pong would be nice... I can just see it: Mage and necro in the back
playing pong against each other, whacking the /target tank, /assist, /pet
attack key every once in a while

I played pong once with another enchanter...
Tash mob, charges me. Fear mob.
Mob gets across the area we were in, and the other enchanter pillages
Mob charges me, I fear, retash to maintain agro
Pillage
fear
pillage
fear
etc...
yes, we were very, very bored.
