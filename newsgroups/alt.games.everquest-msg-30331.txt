If you're set on slumming it in places like derv camps, you might want
to try some of the groups of bandits in the Karanas. There are a group
of 6 or so called 'raiders' on the shore just east of the NK-SK stone
bridge in both zones. They drop bronze and bandit sashes (hand in to
Chesgard in the Qeynos temple of Thunder for a couple of pp and more
bronze/shields etc, that sell for a couple of pp). Of course, you won't
get xp for these either, but all the people of a suitable level to fight
them are too scared to hang out in NK or SK so they're never camped (at
least not on my server, MT)

At 19th level though, I would suggest South Karana for equally good loot
with xp too. You can get into groups at the Aviak treehouse at that
level, and they often drop bronze and sometimes a few pp in change. In a
few levels, group outside Paw and kill gnolls (few pp + splitpaw items +
Fine steel), then eventually inside Paw. Couple this with all the
wandering mobs there like Centaurs (often drop ringmail and gems), and
the frequency of named mobs who drop items (Knari Mohawk, the
Thunderhoof quiver centaur, etc) - you don't see any particular named
mob all that often, but there are a fair few named mobs that wander the
zone, so you're bound to pick up *something* if you fight here for any
appreciable length of time. You can see you'd make a helluva lot more
money here than the other alternative, Lake of Ill Manners, where you
get xp but little loot.

The nice thing is, some races can sell to an Aviak vendor in the
treehouse and all (I think) can sell to the centaur vendor in the
centaur village, so there are vendors in zone. Neither Aviaks or
Centaurs have any faction, so you can slaughter their kinsman and sell
the loot right back to them :)

And although its out in the middle of nowhere, there are nearby melee
bind spots, so you'll still find melee types to group with.

The downside is that it can get busy, but given the wide range of
wandering mobs I never found it a problem if I couldn't camp a spire
outside Paw or whatever.

Try auctioning it in Misty Thicket or GFay, where all the lowbie druids
are. Unfortunately the only people who need it generally don't have any
money yet, so you're not going to get rich on studded.
