Zoned in to FoB to farm some spiderling silk
(not worth it BTW, all they seem to drop there
is the wood spider quest rubbish), summoned my
pet, & got the following dialog:

Zarer says 'Bah, you are not ready for this
trial Your skills are weak and you are not
dressed well for battle. Do not return &
embarrass yourself further until you have
improved yourself.'

After which, pet poofed.

Tried to duplicate it, but got bored after
summoning about 30 pets or so. Best
eplaination I've heard for the bug is that
it might have something to do with a
triggered mob for the 'zerker epic.

-WBD.
