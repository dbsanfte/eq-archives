I *swear* that things were better for me, win2k and SB a week or so ago, but now
life is back to the stuttering norm.  Thus, I'm back to dual-booting to enjoy
sound under win98se.  The accelleration thing should help a bunch for the
stutters but I hope you didn't get rid of that awe 64... or had a dual boot
option if you really want balanced sound.
