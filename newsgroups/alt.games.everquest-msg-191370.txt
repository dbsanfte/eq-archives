    The rapier? Yeah, some of our rogues were pissed about that, too. "WTF,
I destroyed like ten of those, and I need to go back and get another?" This
is revenge by the designers. The original Ragebringer quest required one to
hand in that rapier, and other weapons, to find out how to continue the
quest. But because the daggers you get doing that can be obtained in other
ways during the quest, once one person posted the info nobody else ever had
to do it again. So this is the designer's way of ensuring that all
high-level rogues that want this HAD to collect those rapiers. ;-)

    I think one combine would cost in the 20 pp range using all store-bought
stuff. I have no idea what the sellback price would be like. 7 K sounds very
good.

    Yeah, one of our rogues has it and he has that problem. Chain-proccing
Snare sure can be high aggro, can't it? There's a version of Tendonslicer in
PoP where the snare proc has a significant hate debuff attached to it, and
that one apparently doesn't have the same issue.

    Goof. ;-)

    Yes, that's one of the useful items. All those flower things off the
rats and undead are also poison components, and the dust of decay off the
undead. Go check EQTraders for a listing, but the rule of thumb I use is if
it stacks and sells for 1-2 pp each, it's a poison component.
