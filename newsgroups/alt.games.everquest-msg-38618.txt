As far as the houses thing goes, I used to play this game called "The Realm" I
think it's still out there with some small loyal user base, but personally it
was left in the dust a long time ago.  However, the point I'm getting at is
that in the REALM, each and every player had a house that they could get to Via
a gatekeeper. In that house was a large locked chest that you needed a passcode
to enter.  Once there you could store maybe 12 items including backpacks with
things in them. 
    However, If I remember correctly there was NO banks of any nature. So, you
give up banks and maybe you get a house. Probably would be WAY too much of a
strain on a server to give 20000+ characters there own homes per server. Think
of the Bank as a personal house that's mobile to every town you go to.
     As far as Guildhalls go, I DO think they should add a Zone on each
continent specifically designed for guild meetings.  Give it Multiple rooms
where a person that originally goes in it can set a password on a door so that
only invited guests can enter. Put say a 3 hour time limit on the meeting
before all users get punted back outside that way there won't be any guildhall
camping.   
     "GuildMotd - Meeting in the Faydark Guildhall 3:00PM - 6:00PM Password is
NewbieBeggarsBlow, room 305. See you there"
