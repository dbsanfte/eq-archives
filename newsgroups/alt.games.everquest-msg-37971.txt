Begging, as I understand it, is useless and sometimes aggros.

No idea on pickpocketing.

And for a place to go at 19?  Try the Lake of Ill Omen or South
Karana at KFC.  KFC will take you through 22-24 easily, then
Gnolls outside Paw, then Gnolls inside Paw.  should be good through
about 28th if you like it there.

Lake of ill Omen is better, but much further away.  Always groups
there looking for sneaky tanks, and good loot to boot.  Next to LOIO
is the Fronteir Mountains, and I accumulated 2000pp in about 4 levels
there grouping on giants.  LOIO is 17-24ish, FM 24-30/32, and the
next zone is the "Overthere" which is great EXP through 40, but
mediocre loot.  GREAT EXP.  If you play a lot, it's a good place to
go and level quickly.  At 33 on a pally in a full group I do about 1
yellow bub in 40 minutes (with a good chain puller and a healer).
