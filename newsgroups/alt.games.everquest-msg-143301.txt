Faned made the same assertion the last time this subject came up.
There were others who disagreed with his claim then, I'm not
surprised you are disagreeing now.


 From what I've seen and what I've heard, I would expect the randomness
to be greatest when your level+MR are high relative to the dispelling
mob.  So, for instance, if you are L50 with an 80MR and fight a L60
dragon I'd expect your buffs to go down in order (assuming you live long
enough to observe the results).
