That's the advice I got when I hit fifty.  Went there.  Kicked much tail,
got kicked a few times.  Even got some xp there.  All in all, a very
profitable adventure.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
