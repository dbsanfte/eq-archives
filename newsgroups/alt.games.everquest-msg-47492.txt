Congrats on becoming a father!  Actually I found my playing increased for the
first few months.  Amazing how fast you can level while playing EQ one handed
with a baby on your lap during those late night feedings.  

Now I'm in that between time, the kid is too old to want to sit on my lap while
I play, and too young for their own account.  My wife plays both our characters
while I do the diaper changes at least (something is backwards here).

My friend's five year old plays a mean chanter, so I'm really looking forward to
my kid getting to that age.  It's hilarious to see a kid that young debuff a
mob, fear it, do a burn at the end to get the kill, and ask if it's ok to loot. 
People we group with think it's funny as anything (fortunately he hasn't ever
gotten anyone killed yet).  He doesn't really understand what "the wolf head"
spell (Tash) does, but he knows to cast it before trying anything else.  

On the two accounts thing, I think it's almost a necessity if you don't have
friends who can help with ports and corpse recovery.  Since my wife and I each
have an account it wasn't an issue for me.  

On sticking with Everquest vs DAoC, I'd suggest going with whatever your RL
friends are playing.  Or drag them back into EQ.  I had one friend quit the game
for 6 months (while I maintained his account) and then he came back.
