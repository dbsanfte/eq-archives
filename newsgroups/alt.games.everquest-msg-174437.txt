This is correct - this is the version I bought last year, and covers
everything up to Luclin. It was originally produced *before* Planes of Power
was released and so does not include that expansion.

You do get a mouse mat and a couple of large maps thrown in. Whee.

Two packages required. EQ Gold, about $70, and Planes of Power, about $50.
Or you can order the "gold" version from the US which includes the lot,
not sure about pricing and shipping is expensive, but can be used in
Australia. That may be a better option for you.

Yes, they think we are all millionaires and are doing their level best to
change this. :-) They always try to include one "essential" new feature
in each expansion:
- Kunark - availability of levels 51-60
- Velious - nothing terribly vital, dropped the ball here Sony!
- Luclin - graphics, bazaar, alternate advancement
- Planes of Power - Plane of Knowledge and portal books; raid window

Sony's key goal is to maintain their user base while minimising server
load and hopefully making a truckload of cash in the process. It seems
to be working :-/

Ultima Online was produced a fair while before Everquest and is much less
graphically intensive. EQ is by my figuring 6 CDs in size now(*). With that
sort of quantity of data, releasing them as separate CDs is probably
reasonably but still blinkin' annoying.

        ...Ronny

(*) One for original+Kunark, one for Velious, three for Luclin, one for
Planes of Power. PoP comes on 2 CD but includes the original.
