 A month or so ago, ppl complained about losing cash in trades (if you try
to open a trade with cash and miss you drop the coins, there was no confirm
on coin drop) so they turned it off. Means you now have to destroy excess
Copper and silver. Also means you cannot drop coins for another character to
log in and collect, don't think it was done to prevent twinking tho.
