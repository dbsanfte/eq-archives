As mentioned, you can not bind anywhere in TD (including the firepot
room). But, even given this, it is still highly handy for any non-
porting class.

As you are guessing, it is not only important to know which pot
takes you where, but where it actually deposits you.

For instance, anyone can hop in the Cabilis pot, and pop out in
a relatively safe spot, just beside the zone line in West Cabilis
(by the Lake of Ill Omen Zone), and though you can see the guards
from there, they are well out of agro range.
But if you hop in the Halas pot, you end up right at the docks
on the city side of the lake, with two guards standing right
beside you, certain doom if you are KoS.
The Freeport one plops you onto the dock from which the boat
leaves (about half way out), which is usually quite safe, KoS or
not, except there's one guard that paths out there from time to
time... so a bit of bad timing, could end up being trouble.

But,for the most part, if you invis yourself first, you're
going to be fine pretty much any spot any of the pots dump
you.

Of course, none of that helps you if Faydedar gest you first. =)
