The bank isn't the problem, its the 30+ people clustered around it that do
that, same thing at EC tunnel entrance, NFP bank, Orc lift in Gfay and
Rivervale bank.

Never had any other problems in FV, except for getting jumped by magic
warping spiders.  And actually in Warsliks, due to the low visiblility from
trees, I basically hunted 4 places, Giant fort, 3 spawn giant hut with a
clear area to kite ("Giant Alley"), the goblin fort with the bridge (camped
Grachnist with a guildie) and the shoreline (Alright, that was more of a,
"oh crap I'm going to die, better go somewhere I can find my corpse again"
type of thing, damn gobbie casters dotted me and even wolf-form didnt help
me outrun my death)
