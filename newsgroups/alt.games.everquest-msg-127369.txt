But some people do have desires that go against the "will of god"
though.  And some of those desires are built into their very being.
Who's fault is that?

No, I do VERY much believe that people are responsible for their own
actions, but that's because I don't believe in stuff like Special
Creation, or the god that you'll find in the bible.

If god DID create man as the fantastically flawed vessil that we are,
they yeah, I do blame him.  Just like I blame the parents of any
sufficently bent child.
