Not entirely relevant subject, but couldnt think of a better one.

Just a couple of simple questions actually.

I have 2 boxes, and have druid 60 and paladin 42.

Obviously they now can fight together.

So a couple of questions....

1. If i quad kill while grouped, 4 "green to pally" mobs, will all the xp go
to the pally (sat safely in zone), assuming they are blue/white/yellow to
pally of course?

2. In order to keep pally skills up, when I mellee with him, should druid be
grouped, or simply close by, sat watching and healing/snaring etc?

3 And if when grouped together they kill a level 60 mob, that would be red
to pally, will pally get more xp, or will it be dependant on Dmg output, or
some other calculation?

Any other tips would be appreciated
