My beastlord is 61 and Barbarian.  Why did I pick that race?  Because the
others weren't very pretty hehe (if the female cats weren't so hunched over,
I might have picked that one though).  But seriously, Barbs have great
starting stats so you can solo fairly well in the early levels without great
gear.  They lack night vision, but you get a spell to compensate for this so
no big deal.  I solo 90% of the time and it's been the most fun class to
play.

I would just pick a race that you think you'd have fun with regardless of
stats, as you will get nice strength, stamina and dexterity buffs.  Much
luck to you.
