It is just arguing by misrepresentation. If your point of view has any solid
ground whatsoever, they will just assign you another opposing view of their
own choosing which is plainly ridiculous hence much easier to debunk.

The method itself is simple, ie:

Wife - "Can you take the garbage out the back yard honey?"
Husband - "What - mow the yard this time of night, are you crazy"
Wife - "No - empty the garbage, your just going out to the yard to take the
garbage with you"
Husband - "Now thats just silly, you can't expect the neighbours to put up
with lawnmowing at 10pm"
Wife - "................."

It' is my fault though - I should have just stopped replying once my point
of view stopped being represented as "domestic enviroment and genetics are
the prime adverse factors in mentally unbalanced teenagers"
