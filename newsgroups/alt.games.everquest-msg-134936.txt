EQ, why do you insist on using such loaded and judgemental terms as
"homosexuel crusader groups"?   Despite being politically active, this
homosexual thinks you don't know much about the different gay rights
groups out there.

PS-- you're not really born into a specific religion in any genetic
sense, does that make discrimination on the basis of relilgion any
less wrong?

No, some people claim that, others, like me, don't give a fuck.  The
first step of prejudice is assuming that all people with something in
common can always be grouped together- "They".  The second step is to
assume that "they" are all alike.

I'm sure you'll consider this a personal attack, and it certainly is a
personal observation, but I'll say it anyway.  You have shown yourself
repeatedly to be a very bigoted person.

(PS- I think both the "nature" and the "nurture" people are
oversimplifying).
