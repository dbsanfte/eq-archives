I missed the part where I said anything about EQs demise, fanboi.

I said they were overreacting, out of fear. And they are.

I like EQ.  I play EQ.  I want EQ to be better.  Hastily making lots of
promises when it's become apparent your competition is going to be even
bigger than they themselves thought is not a good way to approach making EQ
better. In fact, I'll predict right now that there will be numerous
"unintended consquences" to the changes announced on Friday that will take
months to get fixed.
