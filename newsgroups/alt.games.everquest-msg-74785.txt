Not sure on the level to start.  Maybe about 23-25.  But, on Karana, I have 
actually seen the pieces for sale under the cost of doing the quests.  The 
quests require gems, and they aren't the 10pp gems, unfortunately.

I guess people loot the gems off of Mobs, get the item for the quest, and 
get the crafted piece.  Cost = minimal.  If they are high enough to loot 
those gems, they can take down any mob needed for the crafted quest 
associated with it with ease.

Either that, or they upgrade their Crafted slot and sell it a little under 
cost to entice us poor warriors.
