When I play I get on for hours, but I have young kids, an evening job, and a
life.  So when I play EQ its to relax, not to see how fast I can level or
how many plats I can make tonight.  I have full Crafted, good weapons, and
the friends that I play with and my guild mates don't care if I can only
play once a week.  I fit it in when I can.  Since its a game, I just play to
have fun.  Isn't that what its all about?
