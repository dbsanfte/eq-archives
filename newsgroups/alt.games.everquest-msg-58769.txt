I hope that you were replying to Empty and not me, as you have said what
I was trying to say much more eloquently. I am English with Irish
ancesters and while not totaly clued up on the situation believe that I
understand it at least somewhat.

If by "legacy of suppressing the Irish" Empty meant it in the same way
that "Legacy of invading France" is true then I agree with him.
