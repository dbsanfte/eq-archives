Its really worth what people will pay for it.

This is an obvious truism, of course, but its particularly applicable
to any trade skill drops.

When stuff drops off a mob that is green to you, you either go farm
it for yourself, eating up tons of time not getting skill ups or exp (and
usually not any appreciable cash or loot other than that specific
drop you need) or you buy it.

What you are buying, then, is play time.

I've bought spider silks for 80pp a stack.  Why?  Because I was
bored out of my mind farming spiders, and would far rather have
been killing exp giving mobs who, as it happens, often drop far
more PP than 80 in the time it would take me to gather a stack
of silks.

But others will argue that anything that drops off level 5 mobs
just can't be worth 4pp per each...heck, spiders in EK drop
up to 6 at a time, thats 24pp right there in one kill!

If I was buying silks at level 30, then my time would probably
be worth 30pp per stack.  At 59, well the only reason I
said 80pp and not 200pp per stack would be that I'm a cheap
assed bastard, since I can certainly gather 200pp in loot in
that time span!

The other side of the equation is the time of the person doing
the selling.  I wouldn't have accepted 200pp a stack for the
silks I was gathering.  And I was gathering them with a 35 bard
(who could do so much faster than a 59 cleric).. but one that
nonetheless has access to the resources of that 59 cleric.

If the bard was my main, I might have considered a much lower
amount as the bard's time isn't worth as much as the cleric's time.

If the mobs I'd been killing had been exp, I'd go with an even
lower threshold, since I'd be killing them anyway.

So back to the acrylia.  Look at what people are offering
to buy it for, what others are offering to sell it for, and how
fast they seem to get the transactions they want.

Hmm, another factor; how long are you willing to spend
trying to sell them?  Personally, I'll sell junk for half what
its "worth" just because I can get back to playing much
faster that way.  The new Bazarr mode may change that
for me, I can leave an alt in Bazarr overnight and come
back to a pile of cash without the tedium?  Sounds good
to me.  But that guy who buys from you at 30pp and sells
at 60pp is probably going to have a wait... if not, you should
have seen the guy willing to offer 60pp jumping on your 300
price himself, right away!
