This is the Ben Sisson I was refering to.  Didn't realize you meant
your Test char and wondered what in the hell a raiding guild was
doing wrong not to kill THO.

Granted, he's a real nasty biatch if you're caster heavy, but it also
doesn't take many 65 level melee folks to eat him for lunch while
your casters whack the ETH's :-).

Yes, the belt is incredibly neat.  Right click 50%(?) haste that stacks
with a haste item (solo char with 41% haste item can almost haste
cap himself ;-)  ) AS WELL AS having some decent stats for the waist
slot.  Stats/AC aren't top of the line, but it's like wearing a FBSS as
a level 30 warrior instead of a straw spun belt.  It's just worth the
loss of a better ac/stat item.
