I always forget that.  My only 2 OS-capable characters are both
rogues.  NEVER have any trouble finding a group when I play
early-morning US, and rarely have trouble later at night (later
at night isn't really accurate, though...those are usually guild
groups and I'll tag along even if they're full).  Getting to  the
zone-out isn't a problem, either.  I can see how it can be for
a warrior, though.
