Why on earth would this be considered an "error"?  The Z coordinate
is your altitude.  Of *course* it changes if you jump up or fall
down.

All this means is that the cartographers of Norrath chose to
denote positions differently than we do.  That says NOTHING about
the world itself, since coordinate systems are entirely
arbitrary systems of applying numbers to a numberless reality.

It's like, "why are there 60 minutes in an hour?"  No damned
reason at all, at least no reason that applies to the physical
essence of time itself.  It's just a number ancient peoples
pulled out of a hat and decided to use to subdivide time
periods.

The people of Norrath decided to make their first position
annotations to apply to an east/west measurement, their second
to a north/south, and their third to elevation.  Period.

You can read *NO* physical properties of the world of Norrath
from their arbitrary choice of cartographic notation.

Horse manure.  The Norrathian Z axis is no more an orthogonal axis
than is the elevation notations on earthly maps.

If there are "no wind currents", why do the clouds move across
the sky?

Actually, the best argument for the lack of a Norrathian spin is
the fact that its sun and moon move across the sky at right angles
to each other (sun moves east->west, moon moves south-north).  No
axis spin could possibly explain that.

Total and complete nonsense.  "X" axis is, as pointed out above,
a totally arbitrary notation.  The fact that Norrathians chose to
list their east/west coordinate first doesn't mean that their
planet is "tilted", it simply means that when it came time to
write down coordinates, they flipped a coin (metaphorically
speaking) and decided to put the east/west coordinate first instead
of second.

It doesn't mean that they "knew" that the components parallel
to the axis were "supposed" to go first, because that's
simply an earthly human convention.
