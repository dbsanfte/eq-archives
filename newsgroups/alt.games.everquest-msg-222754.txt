I was thinking the same thing, the problem I see are adds.  I've only done
LDoN with 5-6 member groups, so adds are usually more of an inconvenience
than anything.  A 3 man group on one mob is fine, fighting two sounds dicey
and coping with 3 mobs scares me quite a bit.  Good pulls and keeping
runners from bringing help seems like they would be at a premium.
