I like to change my view to looking down on myself and the landscape as I
float by.  I have seen mobs directly below me that completely ignore me.  I
know that I were running by them at ground level, they would aggro.  I
always make the run with SoW, most of the time with levitate.  When I have
done it without levitate, I always aggro some mobs on the way, unless I am
taking extreme care to run around everything, they usually smack me once or
twice until I am out of range.  I have never been hit while levitating
across the zone.  While this is not an absolutely definitive measurement
here, it definitely points to a difference in what happens with vs. without
levitate across the zone.
