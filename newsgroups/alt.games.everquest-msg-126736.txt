To ensure compliance with the commandment "Thou shalt not boil a lamb
in his mother's milk" the dietary custom/law forbids any mixing of
meat and dairy.

The dietary restrictions in Judaism come from respect for the sanctity
of life combined with the ancient Hebrews' notions of cleanliness
(a concept deeply entwined with religious belief and practice).  There
are many commandments and customs/laws regarding what and how you may
kill, as well as what use you may make of the remains.  The mundane
benefits (ex: reduced exposure to various diseases) are not the point
of these practices, nor is there any reference to knowledge of these
benefits in ancient times that I am aware of.  Still, these benefits
must surely have contributed to the strength of the people who practiced
them, helping them and their beliefs to survive.
