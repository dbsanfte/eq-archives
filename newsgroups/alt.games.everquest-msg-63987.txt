At level 33 I have 106 1hs skill and 40-something 1hb, currently using a
Dark Ember 13/32 1hb 2str 5wis 20hp 20mana 7sv fire procs burn (14pt DD) at
level 35, the problem is that there's very few nice mid-level 1hs weapons, I
used a tarnished scimitar til I got a velium scimitar at about level 12 or
13 (5/24)  and then a couple levels later replaced it with an Obsidian
Scimitar (7/27 6agi) until I got a Velium Etched Stone Mace(7/22 3str 3 wis)
at level 27 or so when I was hunting in GD and one dropped for a group that
all had one already. (lore item)

Basically, My choice is to carry around a big beating stick rather than
being unable to smack that obnoxious greenie to death or finish something
off when I'm out of mana.   And I still have nearly 200 wisdom, 189 after
selling Eboots.  Just proves all the idiot twink druids running around with
a paw in their main hand are a bunch of stupid Lemmings.  (With fecking bad
resists to boot).  Now I'm basically trying to get better resists and AC.
( I hate it when I duel my bard friend and he charms me - I still kick his
ass with combust though  =P )

Another nice scimitar, even though it drops off Wuoshi, Scimitar of the
Emerald Dawn - 20/34 100 mana 20sv disease/poison.
/drool

And no, I'm not a twink, even if I do have enough money for coldain skin
boots/gloves in the bank at level 33.  (and no one hardly ever sells the
damned things)  though from my personal test, the coldain skin boots look a
whole lot better than Eboots on wood elves. mmm... fashion... AKA why I
still wear tizmak legs at level 33.  I hate the look of plain leather pants
on wood elf females.

Anyways, main point, you won't be doing very much meleeing after level 25 or
so, so those skills aren't really too important, however, before that point,
you should porcupine at least enough to get your defense skill up, once you
get to higher levels, you'll be glad you did, a level 56 druid with 103
defense gets 1-hitted by any giant in Kael arena, a level 52 druid with 178
defense can take a few hits while a tank taunts him off.  (and for the
record, my defense at level 33 is 148)

That enough inane rambling for ya?  =P
