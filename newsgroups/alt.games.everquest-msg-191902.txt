Firstly, as far as I'm concern this guy has no authority to be assigning
seals of approval. He is just own person, rather than a commitee he doesn't
tell us what his credentials are, he doesn't even identify himself (or
herself?). Secondly, just because he doesn't approve it of utilizing "net
friendly" behavior doesn't mean it's not a newsreader (something he himself
says implicitly: http://www.xs4all.nl/~js/gnksa/gnksa.txt (search for
"various PC newsreaders")).

Here is what he claims makes a decent newsreader with my comments about OE
following each item:

These are the proposed standards a Usenet news program should meet to
deserve the "Good Net-Keeping Seal":
  1)  Display all essential header information
  ^^ File->Properties (or alt+enter) click on details. All the headers for
your viewing pleasure.

  2)  Provide clear, separate commands for new posting, followup, and
      e-mail reply
  ^^ New Post, Reply Group, Reply. Those are obviously separate, if they're
not clear, get either your head or eyes examined.

  3)  Provide cross-posting functionality
  ^^ This is definitely there.

  4)  Allow users to change essential headers
  ^^  I don't know what's "essential" for him, but I can edit the "Subject:"
and "Newsgroups:" headers, I can even add email addresses to the "Cc:"
header if I want. If you need more you can click View->All Headers. This
gives "Followup-To:", "Reply-To:", "Distribution:", and "Keywords:".

  5)  Ensure followups and e-mail replies contain a correct Subject
  ^^ Check.

  6)  Direct followups to the correct newsgroups
  ^^ As far as I can tell, check.

  7)  Make sure followups contain valid References
  ^^ I just checked on of my previous replies, this is a check.

  8)  Direct e-mail replies to the correct address
  ^^ As far as I've experience, check.

  9)  Allow the user to change her mind about whether to post or mail
  ^^ Considering it's a GUI environment, all have to say to this is: "that's
what copy-and-paste is for".

  10) Provide adequate quotation and attribution facilities
  ^^ I'll admit this is where some of OE's shortcoming are. You get a ">"
symbol,
with proper white space for easy readability, but OE doesn't properly eddit
the lines before sending. The original signature is included, but easily
removed. As far as the user selecting the part of the message one wishes to
respond to, one can easily remove the portion one does NOT wish to respond
to and insert a "<snip>" mesage. OE inserts an apporpriate attribution line.

  11) Provide a user-specified "Subject: " header
  ^^ I can edit that "Subject:" header anytime I want. I think I'll do it
right now. There, done.

  12) Provide a valid "From: " header
  ^^ Just checked that previous post of mine, and sure enough the "From:"
header has my name, as I supplied it to OE, followed by my email address, as
I supplied it to OE.

  13) Allow users to both cancel and supersede their own articles (and
      _no_ others!)
  ^^ I checked OE's help because I have never done this before (I don't
belive in hiding one's mistakes). Alls ya gotta do is right-click the
message and click "cancel message".

  14) Try to respect the 80-character line-length conventions
  ^^ This is another cause of complaints against OE. Here, the problem is
that OE DOES obey this rule, but it doesn't do it until the message is
posted and all it does is move words that bring lines over the 80-character
limit to a new line. MS just needs to work on the implementation, that's
all. OE-QuoteFix will fix this, so it's not like we're completely helpless.

  15) Separate signatures correctly, and don't use excessive ones
  ^^ I'll sede this fault to, but it is fixable by OE-QuoteFix.

  16) Try to prevent obvious user errors
  ^^ OE will display warnings under the first two cases he describes and
will prevent you rom posting over and over by closing the window when you
click "Send".

  17) Post human-readable articles unless ordered otherwise
  ^^ This is our first real problem, OE allows the user to post in HTML.
Although not a technical violation of this rule, it is in spirit, as many
newsreaders will not display HTML and often times HTML will cause problems
even if the newsreader does parse it.

  18) Provide self-protection
  ^^ I can KF all posts from a particular sender, I can KF all posts with
specified words in the "Subject:" header. I have a few other options. I can
even chose to do other things to posts besides KF them, like highlight them
or marked them as important. The only thing I can't do that I've seen others
can do is KF entire threads started by a particular person automatically,
although I can select the thread and ignore it once I've received it.
Unfortunately, ir will still be downloaded.

  19) Be kind to servers, leave room for others
  ^^ OE only uses one connection to the news server at a time.

So, even by these standards, OE stil holds up as a newsreader. I will make
this admission: OE crashed on me three times while composing this message,
but I frequently saved it to draft to prevent loss. I belive it was becuase
of the length of the message: every time it happened it was when I press the
Enter key, possibly a buffer problem of some sort.
