Right answer, IMHO.  I feel much more satisfaction making my own
plat in-game, even if it's by simulated real-world methods such
as playing the commodities market.  (Buying and selling items in
the bazaar, in addition to selling what my own loot.)  There's
been a lot of discussion over the years about how much the plat
sellers affect the game, but it's hard to be sure.  And I don't
know how they manage to raise plat in such quantities; I've made
perhaps two million plat myself over the course of my three years
in the game, but that's a drop in the bucket compared to what
they seem to have available.  But it's enough for my modest needs. :-)
