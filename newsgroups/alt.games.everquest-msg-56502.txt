While I'm waiting for the servers to come up, besides writing to my
congressman to be sure I get my check for EQ time lost on patches, I decide
to write down some phrases that have made my EQ say "LOADING..Please Wait."

  Wanna see something funny?

  Who is Tovax Vmar?

  I'm pretty sure it's a low red.

  Don't worry, I'll just root it.

  Who is Kidzean Gix?

  No. We're far enough away.

  Cool! Broon is yellow!

  Cool! Kidzean Gix is yellow!

  Don't worry.  They aren't social.

  Cool! Kidzean Gix is even!

  If we have to, we'll zone.

  I didn't know Ghouls could root.

  Is that a monkey?

  Cool! Kidzean Gix is blue!

Lewis
