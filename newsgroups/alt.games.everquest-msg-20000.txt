I don't subscribe to that idea, simply because I believe MY choice of
name would be better than their generated ones. What I do believe the
solution to the problem is, is for GMs and their lackeys to pay
attention and enforce the naming conventions.

Let me give you an example. 

A month or two ago, my Erudite Shadow knight made level 20. I kept
fairly in-character, and had a "history" of sorts. My name was Ariq,
and played with a vaguely arabic / middle eastern flavor. My choice of
surname was Al'mahjub... which in a dialect of arabic means roughly
"From the sun", or "of the sun". 

If it weren't for the non-standard character in the surname, I would
never had a problem. But since it did, I had to /petition a GM for
aid. I told her of the choice in names, and she waited a moment, and
asked if it meant anything in another language. I confirmed this, and
was denied. 

No Titles, she replied, and wished me well with an alternate name.

Surprised at how quickly I was dismissed, I asked her if she thought
"Saurus'rex" was an acceptable surname. Absolutely, she responded, and
would I like that one?

No, I did not, I replied, since she had given that surname to a party
member the previous week. His first name was Tyrannos. 

Tyrannos Saurus'rex. 

My god.

Oh, you can't have the same surname unless you are married, she told
me. Sorry.

Thanks, anyhow, Imia.... I will come up with another. Thank you for
your immense dedication to the "Vision". 

My problem is not the rules so much as the folks that are supposed to
enforce them... One needs more than a simple copy of the rulebook...
one needs to understand the flavor of the game, and how it is intended
to feel. Names such as "Nostahla Westfend", and "Dooly Jonkers" are
great. They fit, and feel right for the genre. Player names like
"Puppy", "Beanz Burreeto", and "Cappin Yoaz" don't. And these are
characters that really exist - and are well into their 30's. I kid you
not.

Hopefully on a RP server, the GMs and their underlings would pay a
little more attention to the spirit of the law as opposed to the
letter.

Sorry, end of rant, LOL
