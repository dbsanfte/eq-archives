Lockpicking gets important in later levels.

As a caster, your role would be sitting on your ass 90% of the time. Do NOT 
feel like you are wasting that time or not contributing to the group just 
because you aren't up and swinging...  Your time is better spent regaining 
mana.

There are lots of other things to consider, but personally I would go with 
the cleric, just because it is easy to get a group as a cleric.
