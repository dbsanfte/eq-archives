You always run the latest patch, as it is applied automatically when
you start the game.

Most of the servers are the same (except for the PvP servers) as far
as ruleset and general atmosphere.  The cultures can differ but I
don't know that much about the different non-PvP servers. 

Best choice is probably to find a server that isn't too crowded at the
times you'll usually be playing.  As you can sort the server list by
population this shouldn't be difficult.
