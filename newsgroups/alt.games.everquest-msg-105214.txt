You MUST go to Paludal! Hunt blues in paludal (But dont go to far in.. If
you see some Phlarg's BACK OFF.. They kill you quick, and has a disease..)

Muck diggers don't aggro (but are social, so pull away from others), and are
ok to kill.. best is Sensate reshi fungus.. U and your pet kills blue reshi
just fine.
The BIG yes to go to Paludal is the extreme XP "Dungeon" bonus you get in
there.. I flew from 15 -> 20 very fast.. Then you go kick some Phlargs..
They are a little harder.. thus working together, but you should have your
cure disease memmed (hmm.. maybe it comes at 22.. dunno).

Get a party and start raiding the bandit camps near shadowhaven.. drops
items you can sell for 2-3pp a piece :)

But.. My "hell" levels was from 27-30 (and probably beyond, but i think the
new pet spells really help out on solo capabilities..) Paludal is way green,
netherbian is starting to green out.. but Marus Seru is good xp, and
relatively safe to solo from the right spot.. Pull StoneGrabbers away from
the planes, and up to the rocks, and you will probably be ok :) But.. major
issue is when the grabber is about to die.. Keep your pet "guard here" at
all times high up away from the plane, cos if it gets stuck down there it
will pull aggro as hell.. :)

Probably gonna hunt Marus Seru a bit more until 35 or similar, then move
over to Dawnshroud i guess..
