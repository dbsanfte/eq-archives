It would appear to have been implemented:

EQLog - EQ Log File Parser 0.8 - July 13th, 2001
Features:

Tracks faction, skill increases, mobs fought, damage taken, damage
dealt, spells, merchants and their wares, players, zones, and other
stuff

Tracks many statistics by level, so you can see how you improve

You can set benchmarks while playing, making it easier to compare
weapons, check the effects of stat values, etc

It's fast

Small size

Doesn't splatter DLLs all over the place

Can handle multiple log files, of any size

**** You can print the information for later perusal, as well as save it
to a text file for importing into other programs. ****

You can save the reports in HTML format, for uploading to a web page.
