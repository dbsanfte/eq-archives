So you dont have 2-4 level 64 mobs incoming to the group all at the
same time.  You cant expect lull to work in a 65 hard.  When you have
a runway you can do tricks to delay the adds (or fade them) so the
group has time to get the first one under control before the second
one arrives.  In almost all groups you join you will kill people if
you pull multiples simultaneously in a 65 hard.  That's not good.
