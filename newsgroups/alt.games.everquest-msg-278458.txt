Yes, found him last night thanks to Bjarke Andersens reply.
Thanks. I still don't find where it says that on Alla's.

I must say that mission was the most fun I've had in EQ since the day years 
ago we set sail to explore the brand new continent of Velious. I have a 
special nostalgic love to abandoned Qeynos and it was so thrilling to fight 
gnolls on the city streets to liberate it.

Also, you apparently don't need DoN or OoW since all my accounts don't have 
it.

Off to sniff some more gnomish wakening powder.
