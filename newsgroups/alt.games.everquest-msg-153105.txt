We don't do formal applications, but one of the steps that most people
follow when applying is to post an introduction on our message boards. One
post was about two lines long.   (Name obscured to protect the ignorant)

"hi, my name is xxxxxxx, i am a lvl 12 dwarven warrior, i heard my friends
talking about ur guild, and i want to witness the greatness that ur guild
can bring to me."



I think he came back and posted a follow up around level 20.  I don't think
that got a single response either.
