Look for a magic/prank shop. Even if you can't get exploding dye packs, 
you can get something else maybe...

there's skin reactive dye you can dust it with... I know I've bought 
some of that once. It's a barely visible white powder, when someone 
touches it it turns bright green may be other colors, I don't remember) 
on their skin and is tough to wash off. You might even be able to get 
something like that at Spencers.

The magic store I bought my kibble from had all sorts of things like 
that, though I don't remember exploding dye packs per se. The ones banks 
use are just a little dangerous (they get around 400 degrees when they 
go off and spray their stuff to 'discourage' people from trying to dig 
them out of the bag while they are still spraying out their dye), also, 
they are set off after a time delay (10-30 seconds) after being armed by 
being taken off the magnetic plate in the teller's register drawer, and 
then passing through a very low power transmitter field at the door of 
the bank. I used to work with a bank teller and she told me far far more 
than she should have about how security is done at banks.

It would be messy to setup, but I imagine you might could try to do 
something with a party streamer (with the streamers removed) and a 
couple of paintballs to fill it up.

The hardest part is getting it in the box without the shil... er victim 
noticing a suspiciously opened box.
