/sarcasm And what is it with Wizards? All they do is shoot their stupid
spells at monsters...AND THEN THEY SIT DOWN! What's up with that? They carry
around those big sticks for a reason, don't they? And why don't they wear
any armor? Are they all retards or something? Sometimes I see them offering
ports, so I go to see what they are...AND THEN THEY DISSAPEAR! Wizards are
really cheap, offering ports to NK...wherever that is, I stay in the Greater
Faydark and hit wasps with my Drood...and then they just leave!
