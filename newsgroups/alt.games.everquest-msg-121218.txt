Well learning/creating/executing the strat is 3/4 of the battle.   I saw
what you posted last week about your Tunare raids (shooting a shitload of
arrows into Tunare to build up agro, but too little damage against her regen
so she won't summon) and thats totally different to how we kill her.

The last Tunare raid (when she was /killed.. it was confirmed) got me a robe
for my mage at least... some consolation.

When we killed TiV (eq first, not that it was a particularly uber encounter)
we had a strat then, hehe it was called "the gauntlet"(tm)

Mobs like vindi... we kill him outside of the arena (past the see invis
bridge, but nowhere near or past the ramps into the arena).. then I either
pull Vindi single (or if were in a factioning mood I'll bring the pets
too)...

Another guild I did it with once, they setup behind the ice wall where vindi
roams,  1 monk would get sow, coh back, then agro vindi and run him all
around the arena.. meanwhile another monk (who lay FD) would jump up as the
pets came running down... messy, but hey whatever works.

We only had 1 upper tier zerg guild (see my Cazic message.. thats them)..
they recently disbanded though (were around 2-3 years or so).. they gimp
mobs in every sense of the gd word tho, assholes.

We beat them to ST.. now normally if you lose the race to ST, you just
leave.. period.  Well not them, they waited till we cleared the first room
and engaged MoTG, then rushed past us and killed the progenator.

Not only that, but they had to take advantage of his being rooted (debuffed
before anybody as much as hit him), so fucking lame.  They did that on their
first ever ntov run too, gimps. (dropped Vyemm with it)

Im sure you remember "random prexian" and his bullshit posts, but 1 thing I
can say for us is we have never and will never zerg or sploit.  On our first
ever clearing of nToV, it took a while to get aary, but from there on we
were sailing.  We dropped Vyemm on our second ever attempt, zero
pre-debuffing (first attempt we got him to 5% or less)

I remember another encounter with the guild mentioned above.. we assembled
first for nToV, moved down to Aary and started killing.  They then assembled
at the zonein, and as soon as Aary was downed, they CoH'd to just past his
pit (ahead of us)

200 people stood in a tiny spot together is pretty obvious what happens when
a flurry is pulled, it wiped both guilds... anyway a gm got petitioned, and
his reply : "the other guild were further ahead of you in the zone, so they
get the pick of which way they want to go"  what a crock of fucking shit.
Because of their cohing ahead of us, they got their pick of the ntov
dragons.. bullshit :(

I agree.. but its easier to be lazy, isn't it?  Our number 1 guild is
working a lot towards VT now, but a lot of time is still spent pharming old
mobs (when they were raiding ST to drop the 4 warders, clearing nToV alone
weekly etc.. they were still on the Trak and VS rotations lol)

Prexus had a 2 guild rotation for nToV.. and when 2 other guilds tried to
move into nToV (us and the zerg guild above) we experienced MASSIVE
obstructions...

I've never died so many times in EQ, as I did in those first few attempts
trying to get INTO ntov (not because we couldn't handle the mobs, but
because we were greeted with several flurrys at once etc, whilst not pulling
may i add)

Whats your turnout for nToV, compared to dain/yeli?

hehe, there should be more anti-zerg mobs!  We've only attemped Shei once (I
wasn't on and I don't think we had massive turnout).. we do have a highly
knowledgable monk officer/raid leader though.  He devises pretty much all of
our tactics (most if not all are totally his own work too)

Does shei spawn a mob when somebody FD's?  Originally I was told he does..
but recently I was told he doesn't

It helped work through our number of needed Dain belts... imo everything
else he drops is trash to average... nobody seems sure if its intended or a
bug.. if the patch was going to change it or not.. so we've been making the
most of it while we can.

As for the cloak.. the cloak rots.  I can think of at least 4 cloaks in
recent weeks that rotted (which now probably has people kicking themselves
because of the focus effect).. Dains shield rots too.. an example of his
unbelievably shitty loot...  even the crown was only asked for by 1 person
on our last killing (a magician too).. and its not like everybody alrdy has
a crown.

Hammers: maybe about half to 3/4 of our grandmasters..  Not too long ago we
"absorbed" several members of our friend guild (a pretty small guild).. so
lately we've been finding people that would actually wield it (rather than
monks using it for a soloing toy)

I personally have no use for it, I've got a 60 shaman on a seperate account,
and the effect doesn't stack with focus.

k.. hope my signature doesn't offend anybody tho!   we get tons of "test"
things used as sigs on our boards (what robot are you, what creature, what
disease would i be, what lords of the ring character etc).. and the current
one is "which barbie are you?"   Mine has a swearing reply :)
