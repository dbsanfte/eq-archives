I'm planning to get EQ but I'd like to know if it would be fun to start
playing now. I mean, EQ's been released for quite some time now and I
suppose most people are on high levels already. Would it be ok for a lvl 1
character to play amongst all those experienced players? Or are there newbie
areas in the game?
