<some hilarious stuff>

Hehehe... glad you had a sense of humor about it.  =)

Seriously, I was laughing so hard I had a tear coming out one eye.  Believe
me, I've been in similar situations.  Believe me, I feel your pain.  Glad
that you were able to find the silver lining - that it's something you can
look back at and laugh.  =)
