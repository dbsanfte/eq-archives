There is no prize for hitting level 65 with max AAs. You shouldn't
judge your EQ history based on levels gained. You either enjoyed
playing for the first two years, or you didn't.

Sounds like you have answered your own question. If no other games
intrigue you, and you want to try a Necro, stick with what you know
you like (EQ).

I'll let you in on a secret. *ALL* MMPRPGs are a "waste of time". So
is sitting in a movie theater, walking in the park, or watching the
Super Bowl. Anything you do to "unwind" is wasting time. If it's
something you enjoy doing then the "waste" shouldn't bother you.

In the case of MMPRPGs like EQ1, you know going in that someday the
game will end. EQ1 may have another 5-10 years in it, but someday it
will end. EQ2 and WoW will not last forever either. So whether you
start playing them at launch or wait a couple of years for them to
mature doesn't really matter.

If you want to play....play. If you want to wait...wait. The choice
really is yours.

>And does anyone else have these concerns?

I don't.  :-)
