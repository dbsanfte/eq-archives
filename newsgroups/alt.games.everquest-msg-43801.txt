Erm...  well, the Dwarf area of Icewell keep is perfectly safe, at any level,
as long as you haven't been killing dwarves.  The only dangerous thing would
be if you fell in the whole.  True, if I fell in, I would have been smart
enough to just wait and have my corpse summoned and rezed, but a level 30 who
isn't in a guild may not have those kinds of resources.
