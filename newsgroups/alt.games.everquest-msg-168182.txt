    See my other post. There's a ton of useful stuff to get. Maybe not "OMG
how did I live without this" useful (except for SCM), but certainly
efficiency-wise useful.

    [snip discussion of DArb]

    You missed one more thing it does: if used at the start of an encounter,
it almost doubles the amount of time before you need to land the first heal.
That's an important aggro control tool, and a lot of PoP is about aggro
control. Well, aggro control or tanking - your choice!
