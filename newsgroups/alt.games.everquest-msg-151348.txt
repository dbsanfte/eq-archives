First time poster, been lurking for a while though. Just had to make a
comment on this post. I started with the free 30-day trial about 3
months ago (the downloaded classic version). When my free month was
up, I was itching to get the expansions, being completely hooked to
the game. So I went out and bought Trilogy and Shadows of Luclin
against my better judgement to just wait out the release of Everquest
Gold. I installed Trilogy, started it up, waited for the patching
process to complete, and logged in with the account I had created with
my free classic game. Then I activated the expansion, logged in to my
server to check that everything was working correctly, then camped
out. Then I exited out to the desktop, and did the same thing with
Shadows of Luclin, pointing the program at C:\Program
Files\Sony\Everquest Trilogy\ or whatever that directory is called.

So you lose nothing from playing the free month before buying any
expansions. I talked with some people in live game chat and was
advised that the above mentioned process was the best way to go.

Now I have to pay full price for Planes of Power, but oh well, having
access to the bazaar, and Luclin (not to mention the improved
graphics) has been worth the money I will spend on PoP over buying EQ
Gold to begin with.
