If half your raid is made of morons that can't follow people into the
lair properly, you weren't gonna kill the dragon anyways so might as
well go do something else.

Let's put it this way:  Because of the level cap, Vox is one of the
harder encounters in this game.  Certainly makes Nagafen look like a
cakewalk.  Given this, you basically need a top notch crew to kill
her.  Anything else is gonna be butt fucking ugly.

If you have enough lag that people can't follow into the lair, you
have too much lag to kill the dragon.

If you have people unable to follow simple directions, you have too
high a fuckwit content to kill the dragon.

If you have to rely on COIN DROPPING to map the path to the lair, you
aren't even fucking close to killing this dragon.
