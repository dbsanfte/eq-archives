AH ok I got fraps (easy to find in hotbot)

WOW ok, umbra is making a bigger diff for me than I thought. I'm on a
p2 400, tnt 16 meg agp, 16 bit color 800 x600 in EQ, 585 meg ram,
texturecache=true, all models enabled and social animations on,
textures set to low, UseTnl=FALSE since on a tnt.

First I tried fraps (frame rate thing that displays in direct x games
in the corner) and set it to update continuously, upper rigth corner.

Got in EQ with the thing set

UseUmbra=TRUE

in EQ client ini. Noticed that, as I thought, running regulary around
shadow haven went from maybe 15 fps to 22 and sometimes down to 9 or
so if several npcs in textures or players were around me (kills me,
probably due to my old graphics card) 
But if I ran down a narrow space between two buildings it would go up
quite a lot.
Then I went in some small rooms that were enclosed. I noticed an
immediate rise in frame rate then up to as high as 35 or so in some
and 22 or so in a more complex room with a small window. I also
noticed that even in complex areas if I hugged the wall only looking
at it that my rate skyrocketed.

Next I set

UseUmbra=FALSE

and got back in game, something immediate I noticed after doing this
several times and logging back into the game in the same area again
and again both ways, was that if it was set to false the first FRAPS
FPS I saw after character select was 19 FPS, while if umbra was set to
TRUE it was 22 FPS.

So I ran around in shadow haven this way. The FPS in basic movement
around the zone were pretty similar, 15 fps a lot. The difference was
that running in between two walls and such did not make it raise. Then
I did some room tests where it should be more of a dramatic
difference. The first thing I noticed was in a room I got several less
FPS but it was the most dramatic when I was facing the door on a side
that led to a more complex area of shadow haven with 2 npcs outside,
my FPS dropped to 9 while with UseUmbra=TRUE it was 22 or so as it was
when turning in the rest of the room.

Then I realized something, this test was really not that good since
I've played EQ for a while with clipping nearly all the way down. SO I
pushed clipping ALL the way up. With UseUmbra=FALSE then I was
basically crippled and was outside the room getting about 3 fps while
looking across the zone. I got in the room and got maybe 10 or so FPS
the one direction (towards a less complex part of the zon) but if I
faced the door and wall on the side where I was looking and getting 3
fps across the zone I got 3 fps in the room too, and walked outside
still getting 3 fps.


Then I put back in 

UseUmbra=TRUE

and got in game leaving that clipping all the way up. When outside the
room looking clear across the zone with clipping all the way up my fps
was still 3 fps. Really you'd expect that though since I'm seeing all
kinds of 3d stuff and nothing is obscured. The dramatic thing is that
when I went in the room my FPS was the same as when clipping was all
the way down either way earlier, about 22 FPS. The more dramatic thing
was that even facing the door, beyond which was the huge clipp area
where I'd get 3 fps if I walked outside, I was still getting about 20
fps while with umbra false I was getting 3 fps. If I then walked
outside looking across the zone I did indeed get 3 fps or so.

So for me its definately working exactly as its supposed to work but
is more dramatic the higher clipping is set and the more obscured you
are from other objects.  
Rooms, facing walls, running between walls of buildings, etc are times
you'll see an improvement if it works. Running across a big open area
it won't make much difference it seems.

Still not seeing why enabling it slows down some people unless it
doesn't work with their hardware/drivers but its trying to so slows
them down, weird.
