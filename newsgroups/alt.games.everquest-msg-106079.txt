Sorry, I'm rusty on my math notation...I can't even remember what it looks
like on paper; whenever I perform these sorts of algorithms, it's in C++
using a for statement or whatever works.  Wait, I think I meant to say
n^(n-1).

It could be thought of as an average chance of 5 damage, times 10 swings for
50 (which is not right, actually), or each possible damage of 1 through 10
occurring once for every cycle of 10, or 10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1 (which is
probably more accurate) for 55.  If you hit every time, you would do 55
damage, but since you only hit half the time, you hit for 27.5 damage.

Let's change the equation so we hit more often in that time period.  Instead
of 10 hits, let's increase the number of hits by 20% to represent a 20%
increase in haste.  If you damage for 27.5 in 10 hits, then an increase of
20% should mean that your damage with haste is 33 damage.  However, the
total damage is really (12+11+10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1) / 0.5, or 39 which is an
18% increase in damage.

You can simplify the equation for chance (and make it inaccurate, but more
comprehensible) and assume no other variables, and then you'll see a 20%
increase in damage for a 20% increase in speed attack.  But even if you fell
back on a simpler calculation of odds, the additional variables will almost
certainly skew the values again.

Either way, just food for thought.  I'm not a rocket scientist (not anymore
anyway) so what do I know.
