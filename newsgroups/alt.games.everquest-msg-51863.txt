I've only experienced this once.  I was grouped with a guy and we were
fighting giant spiders near Snowdonia Station.  He was poisoned but the
fight was going well, then he went LD.  He simply stopped attacking and
stood there.  The spider was aggro on me.  I finished the spider off, then
my partner disappeared.   When he came back, however, the poison kicked back
in.  I don't know what would have happened if the spider had been aggro on
him.  I don't even want to venture a guess.  I've just related what I saw.

However, I will say this.  Death isn't as expensive or as aggravating in
DAoC, so even if LD does cause death, first of all it's not that big of a
deal, and second of all it just doesn't happen very often.  Unless, I think,
at this point, you reside somewhere outside of the continental U.S.  It
seems that there are some networking problems with some overseas accounts.
They are working to resolve this now.

Best Regards
