Interesting concept, and sounds like something worth checking out, except 
for the fact that it would probably be a bear for a new player, unless they 
rolled up a solo'ing class, as the chances of finding many others in their 
level range at any given time are likely slim. I'd be interested in seeing 
a level range listing of all current players.

It would be interesting to see someone else's solutions to some of the game 
issues in EQ.
