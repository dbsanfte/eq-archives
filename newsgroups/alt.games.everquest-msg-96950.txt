Yeah, I have.  But you're welcome to point out where
"Tre Buchet" is against the naming *rules* if you like.
I bet you can't even though trebuchet is a perfectly
good word.

It's just like the last time Dark Tyger went off on quoting
the naming rules with his "Oh, and, by the way, there is no
rule specificly against copyrighted or trademarked names"
statement.  If he's going to quote the rules, he should *at
least* quote rules that actually exist and know that ones
that *do* exist.

There is NO rule against having the first and last
names form a single word.  None.  They can't combine
to form a phrase or a word that violates any of the other
rules.  Note the "or a word that violates any of the other
rules" part of that.  They CAN combine to create a word
that doesn't violate the other rules.
