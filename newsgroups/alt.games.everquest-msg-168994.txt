They are beta tested. These are not sold to you, these patches are
included in your subscription. Some outfits charge you for updates and
patches.

You are not in this business, you don't know why you get extra patches
for adjustment on full loading.

I don't know that is the difference between a "patch" and a patch. 

Lemme see, $12/month, about 1.7 cents an hour. 

Shall I send you a buck? Please send me $3.50 for shipping and
handling.
