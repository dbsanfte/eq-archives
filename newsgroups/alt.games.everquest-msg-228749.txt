That's a very difficult thing to do with Chords of Dissonace which is
the Level 2 song.  The range is very small.  However, with the level
18 Denon's Disruptive Discord it was very doable.  When I was level 18
I used to kite six mobs or so by running in circles.  I rarely got
hit.  I'm not sure if I'd want to try it up in any of the Planes. 
Perhaps if I had a cleric with me that would rez me on the spot,
instead of trying to find someone.  I wonder how much damage the song
would do at level 55 with a troubadour's mace....it's a Brass Only
song.
