I've seen the many posts already about checking BIOS, MoBo drivers, DirectX,
etc. so I won't rehash that.  My experience with Intel CPUs and the boards
that support them is pretty slim, but I did have a similar experience after
an Upgrade on my main PC as well.  Newer AMD MoBo; New CPU;  EQ crashed
trying to get to Norrath, or if it made it would lockup if I moved an inch!
After ensuring all drivers, Firmwares, BIOSs etc were up to date I checked
the heat levels.  See, I used the same heatsink/fan combo from the older
CPU, and same case with casefans and all.  CPU was running at around 157 F,
and though it would web surf just fine it couldn't handle EQ or other
resource-heavy programs. Bought a new all-copper heatsink, a good fan, and a
couple of improved casefans and the CPU temp came back down to a respectable
122 F.

If you feel the need to go this route, be aware of decibles.  Experience
verifies the written knowledge that a 10-unit uptick in decibles equates to
a doubling of noise output.  One casefan I bought was rated at 55dBs, and I
could hear the damn thing from across the house...through two closed doors!
