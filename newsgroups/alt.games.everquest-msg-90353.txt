Clerics, druids, rangers and paladins. Paladins get Nature's Defender,
druids get Gloves of the Earthcrafter, rangers get Helm of Tracking
and I'd been wondering if there was a cleric quest :)

Hehe. With a Tunare druid, a Tunare cleric, a wood elf warrior who
respects her creator, and a gnome magician who has been adopted
by the elves, the only way I will be hunting in PoG is if I should
level up my shadow knight (who will never hunt in Hate).
By the way, my guid had its first trip to ToV yesterday and they did
pretty well in Halls of Testing (I didn't go; maybe I'll stop by next
time) - they got some silk, some leather, and a ton of plate drops,
including plate BP :)
