Hahahahahahahaha!
I predict in about 2 months, after hitting about 140 skill, you'll
want to find the asshole responsible for tailoring trade skill in EQ
and kick him in the jimmy many many times.

Seriously, there's no more throughly fucked up trade skill than
tailoring in this game.

Hint:  Check the recipes and look at where you have to go to obtain
them.
