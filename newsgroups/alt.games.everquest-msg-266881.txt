All they have to do to extend the lifespan of the game is to allow for free
full equip character server transfers, and slowly close down the servers.
Without new expansions they could keep it going for years that way, and I'm
not sure new expansions would really be that expensive; after all, they
could re-use eq2 ideas etc.

It's only the character transfer tax they imposed that isolates people. I
can see it had it's place, but it's time to get rid of it from eq1.
