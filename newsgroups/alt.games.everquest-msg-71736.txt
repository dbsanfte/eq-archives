I don't use a traditional router, as I have a Win2k box that serves as a
router, DHCP, web, and FTP server.  I have no problems getting in myself,
but you state that it let's you in sometimes.  If this is the case, I
personally wouldn't blame it on the router.  IMHO, I believe if it was a
router issue it would either always let you connect or never let you
connect.
Is your brother getting some kind of error?  If so, post what it is.  The
problem could be solely his machine, not the router or EQ.
Also, if your brother can't get on, have him first ping other machines on
the lan, then try to ping EQ servers.  This is just to find out if they can
see each other to begin with.  That should be your first step.

Good luck!
Computers can suck,
