was yellow to my 44 Cleric whan I was there. Casts a longduration stun
the moment he spawns. Easily chain-stunable when you have the chance to
cast between his stuns. His melee is very low. hits not much and very
slow, because he is "chaining" his stun. Go there with a melee a slower
and a stunner and you are okay.
Just clear everything around him. Those clerics that spawn insite and
outsite his room, seem to have endless mana.
