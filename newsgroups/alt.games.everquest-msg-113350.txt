Well, thats a big assumption :)

Thats pretty high end ranger gear.. so lets use comparable monk gear (like a
17/20 glowing mithril ulak, and baton of flame/primal or something)

Firstly monks get tripple attack. Rangers don't.
Monks have a higher damage combat table. Rangers don't.

To make it fairer, have a warrior tank it, and both hit from behind (so no
blocks or ripostes)

With "the proper AA archery abilities", that means the monk will also have a
nice collection of AA skills...  so he gets ambidexterity (improved duel
wield.. I believe it parses at 6-12% more damage), return kick and double
riposte

Now when is the ranger going to KS?  When he uses trueshot?  Sure.. the monk
just uses innerflame (4 x base dmg)
