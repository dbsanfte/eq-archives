I dont think so, because items in the chain never leave it. If you
reduce supply of an item in the "real" world supply drops as
new consumers are introduced and old items are broken/removed from 
circulation.

in EQ 2) never happens and 1) are not interested in the items anyway
as there is a plentiful supply of heavily farmed item x which is better
anyway. Also, those in circulation *continue to circulate* as long as
there is any demand for them at all, as the people who have them will
eventually upgrade and continue to put them into distribution.

Thus, in that model, its very hard for demand to meet supply once an item
exceeds a certain level of pervasiveness.
