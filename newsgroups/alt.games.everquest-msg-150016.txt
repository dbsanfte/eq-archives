All corpses of mobs up to a certain level (level 54, I think)
last 8 minutes before they poof.  Mobs higher than that leave
corpses which last 30 minutes.

Even eight minutes is a long time, as long as people don't
screw around endlessly.

The main way that loot is "protected" is that one of the
leaders of the raid will immediately loot all non-NoDrop stuff
and hold it until "who gets what" is decided.

No Drop items, of course, are more vulnerable since they have
to be left on the corpse until they are awarded.

Keeping a loot window open does "lock" the corpse and is
sometimes used to protect the items left on the corpse if
there is any risk of ninjalooters.  You can keep the
loot window open as long as you like, until the corpse
poofs, I believe.  (Contrary to popular belief, keeping
the loot window open won't "hold" the corpse beyond its
normal poof time.)  I'm pretty sure that if a character
goes LD while the loot window is open, it frees the loot
window immediately.

However, the main thing that protects against ninjalooting
is reputation and/or GM penalties.  Anyone who ninjaloots
an "uber" item will instantly get a *very* bad reputation
on their server, and have big problems from there on out
(since this game depends heavily on people helping each
other).  Plus, GMs quite often will suspend a person's
account if they ninjaloot raid-level loot and people
/petition them for it.  Too many warnings/suspensions
and your account will be banned permanently.

Yeah, often they'll rot, if it's an item that's to be used
"as is", like a piece of armor or a weapon.  However, if it's
a No Drop quest item, people will usually loot them for later
multi-questing for the benefit of someone of the appropriate
class/race/deity.

As for being on a "tell list", most likely you wouldn't be
able to make it to the corpse before the item rots, unless
you were already on the raid or nearby in the zone.  But most
folks will do an /ooc to the zone saying, "item X for class
Y is rotting at location Z, come and get it if you can", unless
it's total junk.  But there are exceptions depending on
specific circumstances, where people would prefer to let
something rot (or destroy it outright) rather than let
anyone get it for "free".

>actually gets the xp? How about the cash loot?

Should people care?  No.  *Do* people care?  Unfortunately, yes.
Every raid seems to have a few whiners who bitch about
not getting the minuscule amount of exp that the "uberest of
mobs" represents.  Likewise for the cash -- uber mobs like
dragons drop about 10p...

I hope the upcoming "/army" commands (which are supposed to
let you treat an entire raid as one giant exp group) finally cure
the bitching that inevitably occurs about who is/isn't
in the "kill group".

Heh -- yeah.  That's why a lot of guilds (or raiding groups)
use a "points" system.
