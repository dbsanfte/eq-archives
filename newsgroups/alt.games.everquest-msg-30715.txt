And heres idiot number 3:
Was visiting my good old home town Kelethin, and a guy is shouting for a port to
Everfrost, because he wanna go solo there.
I send him a tell that you cannot port to Everfrost, and he begins to argue with
me over it, but after a few min i convince him that you can NOT port to
Everfrost, and that the nearest port spot is NK.
Then i do a /whot on him, and see that hes a level 11 dwarf warrior.
At that time im a little puzzled to why a level 11 dwarf warrior first of all
wanna solo, and second why he wanna do it in the newbie area thats hardest to get
to (ok, Fiend of Bone MIGHT be harder, never been there).
Tell him that hes a warrior, and should not solo at his level, and certantly not
at Everfrost, just think of the CR.
He insist on wanting a port there.
Then tell him that Everfrost IS a newbie area, and its a area with almost no
people, and he would be better of grouping in CB for a few levels, or to NRo.
Offer to port him to SRo for free.
He again say he wanna solo.
I tell him hes a warrior, and hes NOT a solo class, and if he wanna solo he
should consider making a necro or a druid instead.
He then tells me "Thanx for ruining my expectations", and dont answer when i try
to talk to him again.

Last i saw of him was when i left half an hour later where he was still shouting
for a port to Everfrost.
