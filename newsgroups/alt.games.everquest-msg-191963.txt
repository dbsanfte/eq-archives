Psychic friends network? How do you know that? 

I assume Lawyers, unless you are talking about the brick layers or the
layers of software.

Ah but they may be, you don't know. Lack of visible action isn't
proof.

Contracts have to have a meeting of the minds, witnessing isn't an
element. I am glad you looked at it.

Do you have an example where they haven't upheld a EULA because it was
click through? I have had EULA agreements upheld because it was.

Using a software in a way that your license does not support IS a
copyright (no W) violation.

Intangible theft form a player who was deprived of enjoying an
intangible that they paid for. Using fraud to UNLAWFULLY deprive a
player of an intangible is certainly illegal. Helping people violate
the EULA by selling plat makes him an accessory.

Sony retains ownership of the game, the hardware, and don't hand off
ownership, but they sell you the right to use it. It is similar to
licensing a logo.

You take the right the player bought from Sony.
