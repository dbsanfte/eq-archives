Exactly. As the 'day' officer in my guild, I am online from about 0800 
east us time. If I am acting any less than honorable, and am not fair in 
my dealings - our guild gets a bad rep. If any of my guildies is acting 
like a jerk, I am the one that handles the complaints. If one of the 
healers in fold came to me with the same story and question, that is the 
avice i would give them. If the rogue in question was in our guild, and 
we got this type of complaint about them, there would be some serious 
and immediate disciplinary action. We hold training raids for our lower 
level members regularly and take pains to make sure that they behave 
correctly!
