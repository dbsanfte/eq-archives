I had the reverse problem last weekend.  My 52 monk wanted to get
keyed for Howling Stones, so I went into Kaesora and cleared the
church to get Xalgoz to pop, figuring I could solo him.  After a
couple iterations, I got the Fabled Xalgoz instead, red to me.
Fortunately there was a high level mage in the zone (I think he
was PLing some friends), who was kind enough to come kill it for
me.  I offered him and his friends the fabled drop, since all I
wanted really was the HS key piece, but nobody in their group
could use it.  (All neither could my monk.)

Then I went to LOIO to get the piece from Chancellor Di`zok, and
found the Fabled Chancellor was up instead.  I decided to bag it
until the fables are gone.  So I headed for SK to see if my streak
would continue and I'd find the Fabled Quillmane, but no such luck. :-)

As for Gorenaire, Fabled or otherwise, the first time I ever saw
her was with my druid, and she was only apprehensive to me, so I
went up and got a good look.  This was the unfabled one, but the
factions are probably the same, so your druid might be okay, just
be sure to check from a safe distance.  Mind you, "safe distance"
can be tricky.  I came back later with my monk, and saw her from
a long way off (we were atop different mountain peaks), but she
was at around 88% hits; I guess someone had tried to smack her.
She glared threateningly at my monk, so I figured I'd swing wide
around her, but as I was getting oriented I saw her turn to face
my direction, and next thing I knew I'd been summoned and smacked
for 1000hp.  I managed to feign death and she eventually wandered
away.
