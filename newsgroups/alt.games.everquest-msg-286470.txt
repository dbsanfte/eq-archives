Wow that happens to me A LOT now.  Never thought about the UI or INI
files.  Just had it yesterday again in fact and I had to wait till the
RETURN HOME button was active this morning and that fixed it (once I
got to a different zone).  My issue on this and several other toons
was initiated by zoning, which never completed...hung up.  So when I
relogged in, I clicked the character screen "Enter World" button, and
it went dead.  Waited 2-3 minutes, then the black SERVER screen pops
up.  If I then try to re-enter the server, I get a "one character is
already logged in" dialogue.  So I have to wait another 5 for the toon
to LD, I suppose sitting idly in the zone I just tried to log into.
Verified this morning time on my buffs had elapsed.  Did it 5 times,
then gave up.  Waited a day, clicked "Return Home", then I was able to
log in.

BTW, I use the stock UI, nothing special, don't mess with too many
macros, just a couple.  All my toon screens are pretty much identical
to the way I like the windows, so I have very little variation in
them.

I do have a number of separate text windows open though, to separate
GENERAL, MELEE, OOC, TELLS, SKILLS, GROUP, and ZONEWIDE DEFAULT.
Often wondered if that was too much.
