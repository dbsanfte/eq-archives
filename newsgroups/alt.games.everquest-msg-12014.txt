Shadow Knights are a melee class primarily. Mages get modulating rods
(although at a higher level than wizards get Harvest). Druids get a few mana
regen spells (although the effect is pretty minor I understand).

Although I agree that a mana drain spell would be much more in the
enchanters province, Harvest isn't really as useful as it sounds, at least
at high levels. At L50 I have about 2500 mana, and Harvest regens a maximum
of 301 mana (actually about 250 at L50, with 10 second stun & 10 minute
refresh) - 10% mana regen every 10 minutes doesn't normally make a great
deal of difference (although it is occasionally a crucial 10% :) ).

The reason that wizards (or me, anyway) bitch about Harvest so much is that
it's the only mana regen spell we get, and we are the only class that is
totally dependant on mana for damage output at most levels - druids, etc can
at least melee a little in emergencies, other pure casters get pets. Give me
a line of Harvest spells (with higher level ones having a lower refresh or
higher mana regen) and I'd be ecstatic. Of course, Verant won't do that
because it makes it easier for us to solo than it already is...
