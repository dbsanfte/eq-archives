I think you're over-thinking the thing.  As you are well aware, almost
any duo works at lower levels.  If each of you play what you like, you'll
find ways to make it work.  And in some cases, the fun of overcoming
things you're not supposed to be able to is well worth the effort.

Also, it's really a tough call until you know what he ends up playing:
IE:  If he ended up playing a Paladin I'd probably stay away from a pure
healer and go for a hybrid with light healing, decent DPS and utility
(ranger and BL come to mind).
