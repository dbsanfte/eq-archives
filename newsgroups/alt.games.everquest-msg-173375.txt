You can raise your spellcasting skills by casting on anything, doesn't
matter what color it is. After I attain every level, I routinely visit the
same spot in Qeynos (the little pond behind Crow's), where I stand and cast
my lowest Evocation on myself until I have my 5 skills points. Then I
bandage myself until I have my 5 Bind Wound points. Then I jump in the pond
until I have my 5 Swimming points. Then Abjuration, Divination (True North),
Conjuration (Summon Drink), Alteration (Minor Heal), and so on and then I
run back into the PoK book and get on with life. Sense Heading takes care of
itself by being bound to my Forward move key, and both Meditate and
Channeling will typicall max during this session. I come out of this with
everything skill capped to my level.

Wish I could do this with my melee skills, they are the only things lagging
behind.
