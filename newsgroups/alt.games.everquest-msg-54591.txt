Oh mamma, I need to earn some more PP lol, I want them items, yum yum  LOL

Surf-unlimited dialup here too, tis usually very good (touches some wood
real quick) but the last couple of nights, I have suffered from half hour
periods of either terrible lag, or LD's, usually around the 9-10pm mark   :
(

Have considered the move to Antonius, and to tell the truth...not sure.  I
am moving towards thinking that the pro's just don't get anywhere near
outweighing the cons..  sure a better connection would be nice, but mine
isn't really all that bad at the moment, and for this I would more than
likely have to loose friends and a good guild..hmm.
Also.... this British server is undoubtedly going to attract a lot of the
French players, and 'some' of them irritate the hell outta me when they keep
shouting in zone completely in Frog speak...ack!  Nothing against the
French, but gets real tiring watching the babble in ooc, especially when I
can't read a word of it LOL!

Here's looking forward to a Bloodgill bashing sesh....   Willough   : )
