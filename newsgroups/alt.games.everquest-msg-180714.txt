In theory, yes, it is possible.. I've heard some horror stories about it,
though.  I've tried it myself 4 times (no, of course I don't have too many
computers..) and it only 'worked' half of them.  Depending on what version
of windows you are using and such, and depending on how you copy the files,
etc., etc.  If you copy them by some means, the 'read only' flag on each and
every file is tripped, silly things like that.  Definately worth a try,
though, as it is such a time saver (definately for me, as I am running on a
56k dial up).

PS - for people who say that they can't play on a dial up because there is
too much lag or such, I run both my accounts at the same time on a single
dial up, and the only noticable difference is zone-loading time.
