Someone's not 'commenting' nearly enough. :)

j/k.. I just recall some of the idiocy I've seen with respect to LOC 
manipulations to get the loc/hour up, or the bugs/loc down... doing crap 
like breaking function calls to:

myRun( application, context, "\"+path+"\");

is only 1 LOC... but

myRun(
	application,
	context,
	"\"+path+"\"
)

Is can be as much as 5 LOC depending on the counter.

and

string pathstart;
string pathend;
string fullpath;
pathstart = "/";
pathend = "/";
fullpath = pathstart + path;
fullpath += pathend;
myRun(
	application,
	context,
	fullpath
)

Is 12 LOC...

I hate LOC. :)
