Based on what? SK's can take quite a bashing and will outtaunt warriors
every second. Ask casters who the better tank is :) Try pulling
in scary areas with a Warrior or get him past areas that need incis.
Take him through a zone full of undead you don't want whatever ..
the SK will beat you in about anything there. What exactly is
'better'. Just the HP? The difference is not that big and there's no need
for it in any normal experience grinding group. Warriors have IMHO
only a single advantage: They're the only ones that can tank an uber
mob on the super high end raids. Everywhere else, SK's are as good or do
a specific job better.
