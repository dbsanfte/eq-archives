I'm now LV12 Gnome Wizard, and am starting to think about my LV16 spells,
and needing to research.  I've got almost 60 practice points unused at this
time, and now about 150pp total (after having bought LV12 spells too).

My question is that I read you need greater lightstones for research, but
I've also read I think here a while back that you can used the burned out
ones for research also (at least practice)?  What about the light globe
(looks like lightstone) that I can summon with my LV1 spell (sphere of
light)?  What is best method for getting through this much disliked research
stuff?  Should I put 50 points into research?  Should I practice and then
put points into it for the higher and harder parts (skill 50-100?)?

Any other tips for research preparation?
And http://eq.castersrealm.com mentioned 3 different books used for research
(not practice, but actual)?  Where do I get them?  Do I need all or just 1?
And what do I do once I make the runes?

What ingredients should I start saving?
