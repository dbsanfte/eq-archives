I'm going to have to admit it; I like twinking.  I've been
playing around with a few fresh alts recently, on vacation from
my main and main alt, and heck, from my old server.  Nothing like
not even being able to check guild status to see if they are
going anywhere interesting to really let me relax and concentrate
on the alt.

Thing is, I'm not finding it as enjoyable as I do playing twinks
on my main server.  I don't twink heavily, mind you, throwing
dozens, hundreds, perhaps a couple thousand at a character... but
twink I do.  Its hard to resist.  Sometimes the alt is inspired
by getting a drop usable for that class, even.

Playing on the new server, I have a shaman with literally a
hundred PP of gear (gift from a friend who I made the alt to play
with, and who hasn't been seen since) sort of fun but he's
slowing down.  Did a beastlord twinked with -just- the 7/28
weapon off my shaman to 4, and a necro twinked with just some
bone chips and drop weapons from my beastlord leveling up, barely
enough to buy his pet spell and arm his pet (for better DPS) got
him to second level

Then today I made an enchanter and ran him up to 5th level today,
really really untwinked.

Now of these the shaman is the only one I'd really say I've given
a fair chance to, but I observe the less twinked I am, the less I
am getting what I enjoy out of my alts.  I'm there in part
because there's rapid turnover, change in what I'm doing and how
I can do it, a rise in power and new spell lines and so forth.

Untwinked, I keep having to fuss around earning money to buy
spells, I die fairly frequently which means having to mem spells
again, and things bog down sooner than they should.  There's
pretty much no chance of grouping sub 10th, so its straight
soloing, and soloing is often a pain in the butt when you don't
have all your spell lines in place yet.  As a melee, this would
be even worse, I'd think, as the world just isn't balanced for a
solo untwinked melee character to level up rapidly; hybrids are
wimpier melee's without their spells until 9th ( I recall my
-twinked with 10pp- beastlord as very very slow, days to get to
9th and his Pet and spells)

Doesn't take much to make me happy, that shaman is going along
pretty good on his 100pp... but thats going to run out of steam
soon enough.  I don't want to put the massive effort into
accumulating hundreds of PP with the powers of a sub 20th alt (it
-can- be done, but its tedious and I've done it many times
before) so there I am, falling behind on the equipment level,
down to where I level slower than someone who's playing their
main!

Upshot of this is, I'm considering rerolling the shaman by
scrapping my 30 warrior on my main server, so I can hand the
replacement another 100pp or two, and then when I get up to 14
and things start to bog down a bit, hand him another grand or two
to go shopping with!

I'll also have access to my characters with tracking, for some of
the more irritating quests which are clearly designed around
having a tracker in group (finding good groups at lower levels
now is a lot harder than it used to be, whether because I've lost
patience or because most good players are on higher level alts or
busy PLing or playing soloing twinks, I don't know.)

(should be easy to find me with a who all forssake, on Terris
Thule, I figured)
