Although we often have negative things to say about Verant and their
sometimes dimwitted ideas they'd have to be insanely stupid or insanely
egotistical to believe that people will continue to play one particular game
forever.  One might argue that they're both stupid and egotistical, but
insanely?

Besides, high levels that get pissed off will sell their accounts and get
decent cash (an ex-guildy sold his 57 CLE for $800).  Even though that's
against policy that's still more cash in their pocket, which is generally a
Good Thing.  Even if they weren't so damned cheap when providing customer
service I don't think they'd ever actively look for people who shouldn't be
paying them.

And, of course, many people DID leave UO for EQ and there's little reason to
believe that there won't be a number of high level players who leave AND
TAKE THEIR FRIENDS WITH THEM when The Next Big Thing comes out.  It won't
kill EQ but I'm sure they'll feel the dent.  And this'll happen even if they
DON'T tick off the high levels.
