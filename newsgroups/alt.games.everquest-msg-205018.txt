    That's why I'm telling you how it works, based on what guildmates have
noticed. ;-) Totally agreed on how misleading some of the descriptions are,
especially considering how bad SOE is at math. Jewel Crafting Mastery, for
example, works nothing like the description - it's infinitely better.

    I always think in terms of certainties, as I'm supposed to be the most
dependable member of the group. 10% more HPs will ALWAYS work - I'll always
have them, they'll always buffer me from low health aggro and the resulting
summons, they work against AoEs, they improve with my gear. Assuming that
I'm up against those 60% hit mobs, 96% of the time you couldn't tell the
difference between someone with no points in CA and someone with CA 3. 1 in
25 chance of being missed when I otherwise would have been hit? Not worth 12
AA points, not until other things that are certainties or which have much
better odds of working are filled in. I'm at 149 AA's right now, plus 1
banked. I plan to get MC 3, UD 2 and 3, and possibly two levels of New
Tanaan before raising CA past what it's at now (CA 1).
