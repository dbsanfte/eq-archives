If the guild is really one that you want to be in, they'll understand.
 This kind of thing shouldn't be blamed on the player.  At times I
have gone LD so much that my guild has taken to saying "It isn't
really a raid unless Jaede goes LD!"  But then I can last for several
days without a problem.  It's very strange sometimes.  It's especially
bad for beastlords like me, since our pets and pet haste cost a LOT of
mana, and if I go LD 3 times in a row without KEI, I'm OOM.  With KEI
it's not so bad, but if I've been going LD a lot then I hold back on
my spells just so I have something leftover in case I go LD again.

Just keep it up...if they're worth it, you'll know, and if you're
worth it, they'll know.  =)

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
