A lot of people do find it fun.  One guy in my guild just couldn't
bring
himself to go out adventuring because he was enjoying crafting so much.


I like the crafting in WoW - its a bit like EQ1 except that you never
fail
to make what you're crafting.  If you are crafting something too easy
you
can fail to get a skill up but that's as bad as it gets.  The advantage
that
it has over EQ1 is that you can make thigs that you can use.  My
leatherworker
made about 50% of the armour he's wearing.  My alchemist has had her
life
saved a number of times by the potions she's made.  (The speed potion
which
gives 50% speed boost for 30 seconds is great)

The problem is that its difficult to please everyone.  I like the WoW
method
because I really like that it's easy to do and never tries to be as
involved
as adventuring.  I very much doubt that anyone in WoW is crafting
instead of 
adventuring like my friend in EQ2 was.
