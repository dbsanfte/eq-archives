Static in the sense that we will never move from, say, an "age of
sorcery" to an "age of industry and production". We will never sell
our horses to by cars. That is what I mean by static. It is a static
age.

I don't play it, but everyone knows it was pretty much the developers'
way of giving you something to do when you had to stare at a spellbook
and sit on a boat. It has no relation to anything that happens in the
game.

Yes, and why is that? Because Orc Hill is a hill that has Orcs on it.
Trainer Hill is a hill that has the trainer orc on it. These are
logical nicknames. "Wizzie" is not.

You're a riot. It has nothing to do with "newbieness". Perhaps it's
your own "newbieness" that causes you to think so. Ok, ok, this is
where you post all the uber characters you have as proof of your
"non-newbieness". Go ahead. It doesn't mean a thing. Fact is, it's
pretty common for true "newbies" use the term "newbie" or "noob" where
it doesn't apply, as you have here, simply as a personal attack.
Sticks and stones and all that crap.

Ya know, I've attempted several times in this thread to clarify my
opinion, but you still can't seem to understand. What I have stated
cannot be proven or disproven. That is my opinion regarding nick names
that serve no purpose. I asked for the opinion of the a.g.e. community
in that regard and appreciate most of what has been posted in
response.

Your own opinion is no more valid than my own, therefore, I can be no
more a "newbie" than you for having one. Why don't you go back to your
tadpole farming and leave the civilized discussions to those better
qualified or at least better capable of participation in the spirit in
which it was intended.
