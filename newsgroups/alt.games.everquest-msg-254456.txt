I found the gnome who sells the recovery solvents, at the Butcherblock
Wayfarer's camp.  He has many types of solvent levels, and the prices go up
for the higher level solvents.  The AUG should have information added to its
description, which tells what kind of solvent is needed to remove it.

Looks like my "Flawed" augs would take a type III solvent. The "Flawless"
aug needed a type IV.  The best aug I have At The Moment is the 10 AC aug
from BB, and that one required a type XI solvent;  to the tune of 500+pp.
That little bastitch is awful proud of his aug juice.
