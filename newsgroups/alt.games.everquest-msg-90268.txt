This 56 Paladin isn't aware of any, at least not if you
want unlimited charges of invis.

For limited charges:

   Mask of Espionage (all/all): 5 charges of invisibility.
   Gnomish Vanishing Device:  (all/all) 5 charges of invisibility
   Larrikan's Mask:  (all/all) 10 charges of Superior Camo

But all are more expensive, per charge, than just buying
invisibility potions.

Even though the Gnomish Vanishing Device can be recharged
(by a tinkerer), the cost of the recharge item (the mana battery)
is greater than the cost of 5 invis potions.  Plus, the original
item is very expensive because of the level of tinkering
required to create it (and the cost of the components).

I just wish the invis potions could be made "stackable",
like the SoW potions, etc.
