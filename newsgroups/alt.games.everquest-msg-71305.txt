Woushi see thru invis and since you never hunted in Kael, you are most
likely KOS to dragons (CoV). If your lucky you can outrun him with SoW but
count on many adds on the way to zone.

Sentient suits in WL are higher lvl but cant be quadkited. So even thou most
wyverns will be green at 56 they are still the best exp and lots of gems.
