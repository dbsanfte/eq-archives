First thing is that the mobs have to be 'social'.  Do they like to help out
when one of their own is under attack?  Some mobs do and some don't.
Second, sometimes they just don't notice your pet right away because they
are after you.  Try kiting them back around and train your pet.  They should
then stop and beat on pet.  Third, keep your aggro low.  If you have done
anything to piss them off besides just run close then they may decide they
want you more.
