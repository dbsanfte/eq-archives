Also, the Shining Star of Light (1hb Paladin, Cleric) from the Priests of
Life guild is rechargable.  You tell one of the NPC's in the armoury
"Recharage the Shining Star of Light", and they'd do it.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
