But competing against my mage, my monk is on the same account (60 monk,
sixty-odd AA levels, primal fistwraps/Tunares staff thing, about 4k more HP,
*FD* etc etc).

I just don't enjoy my mage like I do my monk - so CoH seemed a sensible
place to stop

Grats on Doze btw, some of his tear quests are really really nice.

Guildie mages use their pet in Kael (tormax, statue, AoW) but never in ToV,
or WW (i guess *any* place with aeing mobs rules out pet usage).. im not
sure about when we fight Dain.   I know in Akheva no pets are used (the
pathing there is bugged to hell anyway) but yeah, you have the same
understanding that I do.
