My original question was a bit vague, along the lines of "equipment
suitable to your level".  Not exactly sure how one could define that. If
it was a contest, we'd have to set some kind of melee standard, like
"get back to an AC of "x" and resists of "y", "z", etc.  For the
casters, I guess getting thier INT/WIS and mana pool back up to some
level?
