(Pardon the rotten rhyme.)

I've researched this, but am still confused.  Do the various lizard mounts
have various benefits or not according to color?  From what I understand the
black lowers your agro range, red gives you added stamina/endurance, and so
on.

Is there truth to this?  I'm about to purchase one, but that's a big
investment if I pick the "wrong" one.  And if they're all the same, I'll go
with the color I want instead.

Thanks :)
