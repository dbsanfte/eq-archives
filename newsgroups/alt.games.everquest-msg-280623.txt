From the EQ2 Producer's Notes:

"* The first group or person to attack a creature will receive any reward it 
grants upon death, including loot and experience.
* Other players can assist in your fight by damaging your enemies or healing 
you.
* You will receive a reduced XP reward if your group contributes less than 
50% of the damage needed to kill something."
<snip grouping points>
* In an upcoming update: If a group prefers to play by the old rules, they 
may make their targetted encounter exclusively locked (thus preventing help 
unless asked for)."

IIRC, SoE touted the locked encounter system of EQ2 way back when.  But 
drastic times call for drastic measures, and the talking heads can see the 
numbers of both games so they know more than we do (or mmorpgchart.com does) 
about they way the EQ2 numbers are in comparison to the numbers for 
EverQuest.  It's been almost a year now, and I'd be willing to wager that 
the suits counted on there being more people playing EQ2 than EQ by now. 
That's pretty obviously not the case.

Looks to me as if they've begun the gradual process of making the two games 
as similar as possible.

At least they're having the decency to make the new changes optional so that 
the folks who prefer the locked encounters can run their groups accordingly. 
Otherwise the people who have dedicated themselves to the SOE "Vision" would 
be bent over.

Next I would expect they'll introduce a new pulling system that will allow 
you to split gouped mobs ... again reversing a much advertised design 
direction to make EQ2 more like EverQuest.

As for me ... I'll keep on using Harmony of Nature to split the entrance 
mobs in Vxed and continue tossing heals on someone who looks to be in a 
tight spot.  That's the reason I came back to EQ, and I don't have any real 
desire to re-start EQ2 again ... no mateter how EQ-esque they make it.
