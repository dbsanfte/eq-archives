It's just you.   I watched a 28 conjurer (using the Hero pet
and mostly AppII spells) solo yellow (level 29) mobs and
high blue (level 27) group++ mobs last night for about a
half hour.   (I had dinged already with my Fury so I
disbanded and let my partner XP to 'catch up' while I
did overwatch.)

Mostly they have to be careful about what type of
encounters they take on -- multiple mobs are tougher
because they tend to take on the mage instead of all
beating on the pet, etc.   But if we take on a group of
two she always gets to help kill mine after the first
dies..
