"killing their enemies"?  Are you *sure* about that?  Earlier on,
you were telling us how about half or more of these killings
were nothing but "unfortunate collateral damage" (which means
accidental killing of non-combatants).

_Now_ the story is that all those women and children were
actually the enemy all along, and that the Israeli's killed
them deliberately?

Oh, big settler villages on the hilltops, taking all the water,
while the Palestinians suffer in the valleys, under military
law - stuff like that.
