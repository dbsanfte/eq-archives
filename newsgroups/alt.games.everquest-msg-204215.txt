Pretty much everyone has said what I would say.

Your budget limits you to what you can do but here are some suggestions of
what I would look to upgrade.

FBSS swap for at least a Chitinous Belt (AC13 +5str and sta +10 Disease)
Swap Cobalt Gaunts for SCHW...The effect on the gaunts is not use anyway.

Would take Cobalt Boots over Enchanted Dwarven (often under 1k now)
Enchanted Dwarver Cloak could replace Spider fur.
Bracers with Enchanted Dwarven Plate...Later look at Silver Chitin
Wristbands

Replace Crafted BP with Anything :ï¿½)
Suggestions would be;
Enchanted Dwarven
Barbed Ringmail
(Small) Acrylia Plate
Engraved Royal Velium
Brellium (But this would be in the 10k region)

Centi makes a decent off hander but is also in much demand as well so you
could probably get a good price for it if you needed to sell it.
Wurmy really needs to go, imo.
Suggestions to replace Wurmy;
Defiance
Lamentation
Bloodpoint
Also a Club of the Ice Ocean has the same ratio as a Centi LS, costs under
1k and has a 149pnt DD proc.

All these are suggestions of things to buy from the Bazaar but...Are you in
Guild?
As single account warrior making plat to buy equipment is not going to be
easy for so I would really look to raids to get some upgrades, Kael raids
for Champions armour or the old planar (Indicolite) armour is still pretty
good at your level...although since the Hate re-vamp I am not sure that is
the best place to get it
