A little bit of background first....

A few weeks ago, a friend of mine sent me a tell asking if I wanted
to be PoTactics Keyed.  He said all I needed to do was be in a
group with him when he did the turn ins.  So, I said sure.  Well,
I am able to get into PoTactics now.

Now, last night, I was invited on a RZ raid.  We set up and tried
and failed twice.  Killed TZ the first time and wiped to adds on VZ
and the second time failed on TZ do to a nuker over nuking :/
The raid leaded said that we didn't have enough people to try RZ
again so he said we'll just got for the real VZ in the right wing since
he was up.  We took him out fairly easily, I think there was only two
deaths the whole time.  He dropped some sweet FT3 belt and an
awesome Pally hammer.  Anyways, I was told to Hail the Planar
Projection that was up, so I did.

Now, the question.  What did that character flag give me?  What else
do I need to continue?  Being only Keyed for PoTactics, can I even
progress?  If by getting all these flags inside PoTactics, would I need
to get them all again after I get flagged for PoTactics to use them or
will they just stay with me until I'm flagged? Sorry, turned out to be
a few more than one question :)

Any comments would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
