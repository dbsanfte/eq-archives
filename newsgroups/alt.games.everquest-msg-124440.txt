Are the passwords for sony station and Everquest the same? I cant seem
to get into the game with my account. Iis it possible to have the
password sent to the email address that is registered to the account?
I did this with the station name since it was still using my email,
but I cant login to the game itself to try it until later tonight
since I am at work.  I think I may have been hacked.

Thanks
