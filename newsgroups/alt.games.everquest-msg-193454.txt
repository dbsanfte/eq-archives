I've just hit level 32 with my druid and I can now take on hill
giants. They drop about 30-40 pp so i'm pretty keen to start hunting
them.

Problem is I can't seem to work out any spawn time or location for
them. They mostly seem to come at night, mostly :) Though I have seen
them running around during the daylight hours too.

Anyone know anything about them ?

Cheers,
