The Anti-KEI crowd thinks the game will be "improved" by nerfing KEI. 
They have lots of reasons but they all basically boil down to
"Downtime is GOOD" and the game should be as tedious as possible to
make it "hard".

The Pro-KEI crowd think the opposite, that the game is too tedious and
boring now and anything that reduces that is GOOD.

If you don't like the KEI nerf, the answer is simple.  Sony has severe
profit problems right now.  Write the CEO of Sony, telling him that
not only are you dropping EQ forever (goodbye monthly fees) but will
NEVER buy a Sony product again and will advise all friends and family
to NEVER buy a Sony product.

Believe me, I work in the business world and a CEO getting a few dozen
letters like this WILL cause action to take place.  Not only will Sony
reverse the "fix", I'd expect a few firings to take place.  CEO's hate
to have customers upset, especially in bad economic times.  Unless
Sony EQ can prove this "fix" will bring in more customers to replace
those who leave, they will be in severe hot water.

When I deal with vendors (where I am a customer buying something from
them), if I get run around from their people, a phone message (I've
never gotten to actually talk to a CEO of a major company but I have
gotten phone mail more than once) or a letter works wonders.  Usually
the next day I will have MULTIPLE phone messages from the company
techs and marketing people apologizing for whatever problem there was
and a solution.

Hit them in the Sony bureaucracy and they will crumble quickly.

Howard Stringer is the CEO of Sony America. 550 Madison Avenue, New
York, NY 10022.
