From the developers' board:

http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/Forum1/HTML/000521.html

After applying advanced mathemagics, the commonly known
"hell-level" experience gain effect in levels 30, 35, 40, and 45
has been largely done away with. Further, the "post-hell-level"
experience loss in levels 31, 36, 41, and 46 was driven from
the face of Norrath as well.

So, have you found out how you like your crow yet?
