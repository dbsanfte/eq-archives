Unfortunatley, they did neither.  I always felt that the greatest failure on
Bush Senior's part was not in raising taxes, or not managing the recession
properly, but rather in that he failed Russia.  As soon as they opened up,
he should have asked the likes of Milton Freedman or Thomas Sowell to help
set up the new Russian economy as advisors.  Instead, we allowed them to
flop and twitch in the breeze.  Unfortunately, it's the Russian people that
are paying for that failure.
