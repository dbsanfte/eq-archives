Hmm, can I have your stuff?

I know you aren't quitting the game, which is the usual reason for 
asking that question... but apparantly you are really glad people are 
robbing you blind.

Naturally I assume you enjoy giving away what you've earned, so 
presumably it will make you quite happy to give all your other gear 
away, and I'm happy to see I'm the first to ask for it!

Splendid
