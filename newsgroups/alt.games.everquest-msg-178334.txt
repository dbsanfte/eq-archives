Thank you for (perhaps inadvertanly) mentioning 3 oft-times forgotten
astronauts who lost their lives in an accident that, sadly, was meant just
to be a run-through.  Gus Grissom got the short end of the stick in the
history books thanks to Tom Wolfe, (I loved the book, just think that
Grissom deserved more in the way of what he did since that fateful hatch
blowing incident).  Three astronauts lost their lives in the Apollo program,
and if not for the Apollo program there wouldn't be the space travel we have
today.  (I would wager a guess that most people couldn't even name the other
two astronauts killed in that accident without looking it up.)

While the tragedy of 7 good people dying far too young is horrible, we
should take the time to remember the men (and women) who have lost their
lives in the pursuit of something so great and majestic, that they are part
of a rare few.  These men (and women) truly were the best of the best, and
until we find the reason for today's crash/explosion, they deserve only
honor, respect, and awe.

Sadly, there was something in the back of my mind, which may be considered
shallow, but it was there nonetheless.  Apollo 1 happening on the ground.
Challenger happened immediately after takeoff.  And lastly, Columbia
happened on landing.  To this day NASA has not lost an astronaut in space.
(Although it could theorhetically be argued that some of the test pilots at
Wright Patterson died in space, and with Columbia's height it is up for
grabs, but I still say that NASA hasn't lost a man in space. call me a
romantic.)

For those of you out there who haven't read The Right Stuff, pick up a copy
and go for it, while your at it, read Yeager's biography, and then look over
the NASA website.  The exploration of space is important to the men and
women who vie for a coveted position on the shuttle and it should be as
important to those of us who look up in the sky and can say, "One of  our
own (meaning humans, not just Americans) has been up there, has looked at
the stars close up, has seen the surface of the moon, has touched the sky."

I want to leave you with a quote that my teacher gave our class after the
Challenger exploded.  While it certainly doesn't explain away everything to
the mind of a 12 year old, it helped me get past my first real national
tragedy.  And who knows, maybe my interest in space wouldn't have been
piqued without hearing this quote and wanting to learn more about the
ineloquent man who so eloquently stated it.



      "If we die, we want people to accept it. We're in a risky business,
and we hope that if anything happens to us it will not delay the program.
The conquest of space is worth the risk of life."
      -Gus Grissom
