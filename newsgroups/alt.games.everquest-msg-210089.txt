Nowdays, in general, you'll be lucky to keep any melee skill maxed below
level 10, thanks to new, improved speedy levelling.

For warriors in particular it'll speed up quite a bit with Dual Wield at
13 and Double Attack at 15. Each of those skills will give you quite a few
more chances for improving your weapon skills. If you just keep at it,
you will likely have all your weapon skills (except Throwing, H2H, and
Archery) maxed by 25-30, I'm guessing.

It'll help if you keep around some speedy practice weapons (weapons with
low delay). Hitting up your local shaman for Dex buffs will make a big
difference. I seem to get more skillups off white, yellow, and red mobs
than I do off blue and teal ones. Dying a lot gives you more opportunities
to max out your skills by slowing down the speed you level -- not a tactic
I'd recommend, but it's a nice consolation prize if you do wipe. :)

Also, if you have the practice points to spare, I'd train the skills to
30-50 first. Like Sense Heading, those first points of weapon skills take
forever to improve. But once you get them going, they actually climb fairly
quickly on their own.

Another simple trick if you have the patience for it: once you hit 13,
you'll be wanting to Dual Wield most of the time, which makes it less
convenient to practice Bash. Stealing a trick from bards, if you keep your
shield on your cursor, wait til the Bash key highlights. Swap the shield
for your offhand weapon, press Bash, then swap the weapon back for your
shield. Repeat each time Bash highlights. That way you can keep practicing
Bash without lowering your DPS too much.
