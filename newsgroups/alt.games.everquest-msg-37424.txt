Tradeskills come in under the 'ability at level 1' rule that taunt
doesn't. And I'm thinking Dan Dutra might have accidentally trained a
point in taunt at some later time and didn't notice - there's a
difference between taking one hell of a long time to raise an
untrained skill from 0 to 1 (I do that a lot) and going dozens of
levels without raising that one point, something that should be taken
as a message that you should head to your closest trainer.
