Kabbalah, as used in some occult groups, is effectively a form of 
numerology.  Ie, a system whereby you see new meanings in words and how 
they relate based on the number associated with them.  And YHVH is a word.  
It -is- a particuarly interesting word, yes.  But you can do Kabbalah, by 
some standards, with words other than YHVH.

Nope, neither name rings a bell.  At an offhand guess, I'd say they're 
speaking to the origins of Kabbalah in Jewish Mysticism, in which I will 
concede that the tetragrammaton is more or less the whole point.  
Similarly with devotees of Hemetic Kabbalah.  But not all modern 
Kabbalists seem to see it that way.  Now, you can argue that if they don't 
keep that idea as central, they aren't really doing Kabbalah.  If you 
really want.  But they claim they are.

}>I've heard a good number of Wiccans suggest that Gardner didn't have a 
}>blinking clue,
}About what?

I don't remember exactly.  I just remember them saying things that 
amounted to "His books sucked.  They completely failed to reflect the 
Wicca that -I- experience."

}> a few froth at the mouth in drooling adoration, and a few say 'who?'
}If they have no knowledge of him, they are very
}poorly educated about their own religion.

Shrug.  Not everyone reads the same books.  Not everyone would consider 
the same things an important part of such an education.  Not everyone 
would consider the history of their religion important, even.  You are, of 
course, quite free to call them "n0oBz".

Hmm.  In retrospect, I apologize for painting Gardnerians as frothing 
droolers.  I just got caught up in really liking the ring of the phrase.  
No offense was intended.  And some have been, well, rather enthusiastic.

}Have you ever read any history of Wicca, that doesn't mention Gardner?

Dunno.  I really don't feel like thumbing through even the few I've read 
and sorting them into two piles on such a basis. :)  Especially since my 
library is 3000 miles away right now.  Thank goodness my ex gave those 
books back, at least, before she decided to be Born Again.  

Bah.  I suspect Charles Leland's "Aradia: Gospel of the Witches" prbably 
doesn't mention him though.  Similarly with Margaret Murray's "The Witch 
Cult in Western Europe" or "The God of the Witches".

}Are there any serious claims that Gardner had
}nothing to do with Wicca?

Never said he had nothing to do with Wicca, just that he isn't  
universally revered as an authority.

}>I'd hardly say he's necessary to Wicca.
}What do you mean by 'necessary'?
}He is inseparable from the history of Wicca. He
}almost single-handedly brought it to the notice of
}the general public, with his writings.

Well, some don't seem to think those writings line up with their je ne 
sais quoi very well. 

}Who would you say has been 'necessary' to Wicca?

I wouldn't say.  I'd go ask a Wiccan.  And as Lokari wisely observed, 
three Wiccans would probably give me three widely different answers. :) 

Actually, this page here puts it pretty well:

-----
Depending upon how you look at Wicca, it is either one of the newest or 
one of the oldest religions in the world: 

*    Wicca is a recently created, Neopagan religion. The various branches 
of Wicca can be traced back to Gardnerian Witchcraft which was founded in 
the UK during the late 1940s.

*    Wicca is based on the symbols, seasonal days of celebration, beliefs 
and deities of ancient Celtic society. Added to this material were Masonic 
and ceremonial magickal components from recent centuries. In this respect, 
it is a religion whose roots go back almost three millennia to the 
formation of Celtic society circa 800 BCE.  
----- http://www.religioustolerance.org/witchcra.htm

You'll note that one view mentions Gardner, and the other, strangely, does 
not...

I do think that it's quite possible you're biasing your sample.  Tarot, 
yes, has loads to do with Kabbalah (although there are ways to approach 
tarot without Kabbalah...) and naturally, you're going to draw to 
yourself Wiccans who are interested in Kabbalah, and not so many who 
aren't...

}>  It's about like talking about Falwell's role in Christianity...
}More like St. Paul's role in Christianity.

Perhaps, at most.  But he ain't Christ.  He wasn't Moses.  You could make 
an argument for him having Muhammad's role in Christianity... :) 

}>  Many non-Wiccans are also familiar with it. If you were gonna 
}>associate it with a particular group, and didn't want to choose Jewish 
}>Mystics for some reason, I'd probably suggest Ordo Templi Orientis.
}A group that Gardner was well acquainted with, and borrowed heavily from.

Heheh, which may be the root of the problem right there.  Apparently, not 
all Wiccans felt that that was good stuff to be borrowing.  

}Some questions for you and any Wiccans interested in the truth of the 
}matter;

Ooooh, there's an absolute, incontrovertible truth? :)

}What is the origin and symbolism of the pentagram?

Here's my three answers.  Which were you looking for?  They do overlap 
somewhat.

http://dylangwalchmai.tripod.com/symbolism/pentagram.htm
http://www.thornr.demon.co.uk/kchrist/pent.html
http://yew.lweb.net/pent.htm

They all at least mention Pythagoras.  Two mention Mesopotamian potsherds 
that predate Pythagoras by about 3 millenia though.  One ties it to 
alchemy.  One links it with apples, Adam, and Eve.  One mentions it as the 
Seal of Solomon.  One brings up Cormac's Cup of Gold.  One mentions 
Baphomet and Eliphas Levi.

Lol.  One observes that "five-fold symmetries are rarely found in 
non-organic life forms". :)  Yup, that living silicon, it's so... 
square... :) Lol!  And I cut and pasted that funny, and found 21 pages 
with the mistake copied almost verbatim. :)

}Who is Robert Cochrane 

A contemporary, arguably Wiccan, rival of Gardner, wo apparently had 
rather a bit of disdain for him?

}and what does '1734' mean in association with him?

-----
The order of 1734 is not a date of an event, but a grouping of numerals 
that mean something to a witch.  One that becomes seven states of
wisdom is the Goddess of the Cauldron.  Three that are the Queens of 
the Elements, fire belonging to Man alone, and the Blacksmith God.  Four
are Queens of the Wind Gods.  The Jewish orthodoxy believes that 
whomever knows the Holy and Unspeakable name of God has absolute power
over the world of form.  Very briefly, the name of God spoken as 
Tetragrammaton ... breaks down in Hebrew to the letters YHVH, or the Adam
Kadmon (The Heavenly Man).  Adam Kadmon is a composite of all 
Archangels - in other words a poetic statement of the names of the 
Elements.  So what the Jew and the Witch believe alike, is that the man 
who discovers the secret of the Elements controls the physical world. 1734 
is the witch way of saying YHVH." (Cochrane, 1966).  
----- http://www.controverscial.com/Robert%20Cochrane.htm

So what you're saying here is that of course they'll know how to say 1734 
in Hebrew?  Assuming that they follow Cochrane, that is... Oh, 1734 is 
also apparently the name of his order, which still survives.

}>I think it's more like 'You dont have to know the significance of the 23rd 
}>Psalm to be a Christian.'
}A matter of degree perhaps, but you couldn't say
}that the 23rd Psalm has "no significance
}whatsoever" to Christianity, could you?

Not at all, nor would I say that YHVH has -no- significance whatsoever to 
Wicca.  But I don't think it's absolutey required reading.

And of course, the -real- significance of the 23rd Psalm:  It made Jules 
sound -really- scary in Pulp Fiction.

And by the way, thanks for inspiring me to go look interesting things up.  
I enjoy that.
