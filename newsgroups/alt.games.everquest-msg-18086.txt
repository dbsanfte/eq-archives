Good idea to pick just one weapon skill. Keep up the good work of
trying to keep it maxxed (84 at level 20). There aren't many Druid 1hs
with good stats (notable exception being the epic), so go for max
damage. Pick up a hand held items with stats to swap out with the
scimitar when you aren't melee'ing.

Try to keep all spell skills maxxed. 105 at level 20. Just stand
somewhere safe, select a level 1 spell (low mana) and cast it
repeatively on yourself. (Channeling and med take care of themselves.)

> Defense -90
> Offense - 98

Max for offense and defense is 100. ALWAYS ALWAYS try max out defense.
It makes getting 700 AC a lot easier and is probably the only way to
get that 850 AC you will want at 50+. It gets harder as you level, but
even my level 46 druid would fight spectres hand-to-hand to get that
occasional defensive skill raise. Usually if you max defense,
offensive and weapon skills will max too. (if not, melee fleeing mobs
to raise offensve/1hs)

How to max defense:

method #1 (while getting xp)
pre-fight:
(optional) get a ranger or shaman to cast Feet like a Cat on you
skin buffs, fire fist, str buf, regen buff (if you have one), SOW or
wolf form
ready-to-pull:
cast damage sheild
pull a single blue warrior mob with snare (fast hitting; low damage is
best)
melee until you are down a few bubs of health
run off and cast heal on your self
repeat until mob is dead
If you need help killing the MOB, cast swarm spell while it is coming
to you.

method #2 (no xp, but max skill increases)
This method only works if you have regen and ensnare. level 34+?
regen, skin buffs, SOW wolf form
ensnare 4 blue mobs of the same speed.
now let them all beat on you, run away after losing a couple bubbles.
(don't go too low on health in cast you get stunned.)
Sit and let regen do it's work. (cast a greater heal sometimes, but
save enough mana for gate and buff recasts) If the mobs get close
before you are ready, run away again and sit.
repeat until you are tired of the 4 mobs chasing you and zone/gate.

> Sense Heading -105

105 is probably good enough but keep on maxxing it. Why not?

> Swimming -14

Need to max this. (100 I think at level 20). Felwithe is my favorite
place to practice swimming. Cast enduring breathe on yourself and just
swim laps at the bottom of the pond.

I didn't see foraging anywhere. You'll need this for some druid quests
(including the epic.) Get this maxxed. (just like sense heading, you
click on it.)  Also useful when you run out of store bought
food/water. With a high enough foraging skill, you will forage more
food and water than you can eat/drink.

Don't waste practice points on specialization. Just put 1 point in all
5 to activiate them. Now remember, the first specialization skill to
reach 50 can go to 200, the others are capped at 50. But all 5 start
at 30, so just immediantely cast a level 1 spell of the type you want
to specialize in on your self over and over until it reaches 50.

I would save practice points for quests you want to do. What I mean is
a couple quest require language skills or trade skills. So if you
realy want to do a quest requiring those types of skills, you'll have
the practice points you'll need. IIRC it cost 90 points to learn a
language well enough to do a quest and trade skills cost 20 points
(max points you can put in a trade skill).
