I get that, but that's where the whole buying into the idea comes in. 
Honestly, if one is unable to avoid approaching the game strictly from a 
perspective of amassing wealth with which to buy better and better gear, 
then this is likely not the guild for them. That said, your example of 
the Iksar Berserker Club, or any item for that matter, would be 
perfectly acceptible as long as the player obtained it themselves rather 
than by purchase.

All good points. I don't feel hunting for a specific drop is comparable 
to farming, if that's the comparision you were making. Camping a drop is 
a basic part of EQ, and if someone needs to do so to obtain a particular 
item, then I would hope there would be guildmates there to help.

The idea of hunting hill giants does pose an interesting point though. 
Imagine if their loot table were suddenly changed, causing them to drop 
no more than several gold. Would people still choose to hunt them? I'm 
guessing not. Well, maybe for some fine steel weapons or something. The 
point is, this guild should embrace the idea that money is not the be 
all end all of EQ. In fact, what wealth may collect in one's bank 
account doesn't necessarily have to burn a hole in their pocket. They 
don't have to just run out and spend it, do they? That would run counter 
to what they joined the guild for in the first place.

I'm sure no one will be perfect in this regard, but I will try to make 
it perfectly clear up front what we are trying to achieve.

Valid points. As I mentioned, maybe the real challenge will be to adopt 
a mindset that doesn't care how much money is in the bank. So what if 
you wind up level 50 with 30k amassed? Maybe you could splurge and buy a 
mount or something. It doesn't have to be spent at all.

No, as I mentioned, farming for tradeskill components would be fine. As 
a matter of fact, it might be a good idea to discourage the purchase of 
even tradeskill components, as it does go against the idea of doing for 
yourself.

I agree, though I would mention, as pointed out to me elsewhere, that 
banded apparently pales in comparison to the newbie armor these days. :/
