I'm going off guesswork and EQ2 spell lists, but not EQ equivalencies.
I saw no indication in the published spell lists that any
non-summoners would get pets of comparable power to even shaman pets
in EQ.  There are various "pets" for non-summoners, but few of them
are of the persistent controllable type that most EQ pets are
(including the druid pet) - they are, I think, comparable to the
cleric/wizard poofy pets, mostly.  To me those aren't proper pets, and
in the sense the original poster meant it I think only summoner pets
are interesting, but I should perhaps not have ignored the other pets.

Looking closer at various spell lists I see there are more pets than I
thought there were - I must have been sloppy reading the lists before.
Perhaps some of these pets are useful enough to make those classes
proper pet classes.  Cleric subclasses and rangers have a single pet
spell at higher levels that doesn't sound terribly limited, but I
doubt it's going to be that powerful.
