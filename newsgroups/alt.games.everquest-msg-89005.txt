There's a named cycle in EJ? Which mobs and what are the good drops?
We've done the named cycle in Trak's plenty of times, but I haven't
noticed much in the way of oddly named mobs in EJ. (Leaving aside the

Where do you pull from and which mobs? We have a ranger we group with
regularly, so finding them shouldn't be an issue.
