I believe I was heading up to the armors to join a few friends that were
farming /gems for quest armor.  Being a warrior, I had no invisibility, and I
was probably out of SoW potions at the time.   Right about when I got to the
center of the zone, a green mist panther aggroed on me.    As for what
happened after that?  My hit points went down faster than his.   Had I run, I
would still have had no chance, with it smacking me in the back the entire way
to Kael (where the door guards would have joined it.)

This was before the "Light blue" mobs were added, so it might have fallen into
that catagory, but it was most definitely green at the time.

At 51 or 52, I tried to do exactly what he had suggested.   Mow down 2 or 3
greens at a time to get Gate Potion ingredients out of Crystal Caverns.  With
no way to stop a runner, one orc became two, and within about 3 fights I was
"Loading, please wait."  The orcs that teamed up to kill me were all quite
green to me.
