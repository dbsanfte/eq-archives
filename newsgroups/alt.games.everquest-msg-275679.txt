I have an old DLink DI-614+ and a cheap noname cardbus 802.11b wireless 
nic for my Toshiba laptop. I used to use the laptop to keep my bazaar 
character on overnight, and had few problems. It was however generally 
within 20 feet of the router in the same room. I also used to play in 
the next room (through old style wooden walls/drywall, not a lot of 
metal or concrete) and had no problems.
