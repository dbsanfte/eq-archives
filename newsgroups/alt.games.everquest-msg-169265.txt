75ish

> What did you spend points on?

Run 3
Regen 3
First Aid 2
Innate lung capacity 1 (don't ask)

Combat Agility 3
Natural Durability 3
Combat Stability 1 (this is my next one to work on)

Rapid feign 3
Return kick 1
Double riposte 1

Technique of Wu 1

And some other junk that I'm forgetting at the moment.

> What are you planning to get next?

Combat stability 2 and 3, then Physical enhancement.  Then probably
lightning reflexes.  If I ever get a good 2hb weapon I'll probably pick up
the extra 2h attacks skill along the way.  Ambidexterity is also on the
list, but not a big priority.

> Do you wish you hadnt bought certain abilitys?

Return kick and double riposte are utterly freakin useless.  They sucked
before the monk nerf and I do a hella lot less tanking now.
