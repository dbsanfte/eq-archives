Awww wheres the fun in that? Ahhh the memories. I remember how
exciting it was making my first trip from Qeynos to Freeport in the
days when there werent many people who could group port. Also there
were few players above level 30 or so, so the giants and griffons had
thier way with everyone. THAT was exciting. Seeng the gates of
Freeport after this nervewracking journey was exhillerating and I
kissed the ground as I passed thru the gates. Its unfortunate that
these days, with POP, that new players miss out on this type of
travel, and can simply bamf around using the books.
