Two of you have given me ways for me to prove that I do in fact work
at SOE, I have sent 1 of them an E-mail from work, as of yet I have
not heard back from person nor has the person posted here that  he has
recieved the E-mail and that as far as he goes I do work here.
I have to wait till tomorrow at work to see if he responds or not.
