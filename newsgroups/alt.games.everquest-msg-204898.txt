Well my comparison to this is using Narandi's Lance in place of Fleshgrinder
and <other>
With both there seemed to be a range where I could hit sometimes and be out
of range others, I just assumed mob was in/out of range while swinging to
attack.

Not sure I agree with the mobs range advantage being so great, with the way
things are (or appear to me, at least) where weapon sizes have no effect on
range then only Giant sized mobs should have a range advantage, anything not
of that scale should be the same as players. If they can hit you then you
can hit them. I can fully understand a Brute or Giant or Drolvarg outranging
a player but not a Dwarf.
