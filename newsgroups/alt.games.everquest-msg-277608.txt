I received EQ2 for Christmas, so, yes, I'm a newbie.  I hang here a lot and
try to learn, but I don't post very much.  However, I'd love some input on
my situation:  I bought a second copy of EQ2 (and a second account) for my
7-year-old son, because he was playing mine all the time, and I knew it
would be a blast for him and me to play together.  Well, I was correct about
it being fun as heck, but I'm looking for ways to improve our experience
(not as in "XP" in the game, just our level of fun) as a duo.  And don't
worry about him being only seven years old.  He does really well, although
he's just now learning to type fast enough to chat effectively.  He's in
first grade, but he reads on a 6th grade level, so he can follow directions
and do his job well in groups.  He currently plays 5 different characters,
but his main one when we play is his L16 Sorcerer.  The other players never
seem to suspect that he's young, and he seems to always be welcome in the
groups he's in.

What are some things we can do to "branch out" together?  Would you
recommned us joining the same guild, perhaps?  Or how could we choose
tradeskills that will be mutually-beneficial over the long term?  If you had
a friend with whom you could devise "strategies" to help each other, how
would you do it?  Right now we mostly just group up and fight stuff.  It's
fun, but we're now looking for "more."

Input appreciated.
