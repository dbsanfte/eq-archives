Same reason spells fizzle and why some spells like invisibility and
root have a random duration. Its to add an element of uncertainty
and randomness to the game. Not many things in EQ are a sure
thing.

To maximize your summon make sure you have a focus item.
A focus item does not increase level but it does greatly increase
the abilities of the pet.

AFAIK there is no way to increase the level of the pet. Or to know what
level your pet is unless you have some other people con it and try and
figure it out from there.

Usually I just summon the pet and work with whatever I get. I usually
hunt tons of low blues rather that trying to go for high blues to reds
all the time. So a lower level summon is not a big deal. A lot of times
If I know I have a low pet I will just use it up on some kill rather than
reclaim it.

At least the Epic pet is always Level 49.
