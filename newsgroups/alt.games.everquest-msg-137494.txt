Cheal, fair enough.. but seeing   %t MALOD in the guild chat, raid channel,
and sometimes even the shaman channel too...  seeing %t INC in guild chat
and raid chat, %t TASHED in both,  seeing the warrior spam "I have aggro on
%t HEAL ME" on both channels.. arghhh

Maybe those 2 necros only played/raided when they were stoned or something?

If im honest, I doubt I could even name more than 5 servers.. let alone
