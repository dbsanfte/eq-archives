Poke around the options menu some (Alt O)  (or it might have been another
place, I'm not exactly certain.)

But there is a place in game where you can set loot rules for your group.
The group leader has three options to choose from.

1) Free for all
2) Leader loot only
3) Lottery


I haven't tried the third option yet, so I'm not sure if it just randomly
hands out the loot, or if it makes you signify in some way that you want it,
then distributes it among those who want it.
