No, the problem is when you split to raid, the xp is cut before the split.
(unless they've changed things since I was there.)

example, using theoretical number, since I don't know the real 'raid
penalty'.

two groups of 6 characters of the same level each kill 2 identical mobs. (4
mobs died for this experiment)
each party member gets a total of: (base_mob_xp*group_exp_bonus(1.8 iirc)/5
(because the 6the doesn't count anymore, he's 'free power'))*2, or
0.72*base_mob_xp

a raid of 2 6 person parties, all members of the same level, kill 4 mobs.
each party member gets: (((base_mob_xp*group_exp_bonus(1.8
iirc)/5)/2)*45%)*4 or 0.324*base_mob_xp
