I don't mind if its easy fights and the cleric is FM.

Only if the tell is stupid. The terms themselves are not that bad.

All I say is 'no sorry' then I ignore them, otherwise they keep sending
you tells thinking you didn't here them. Most beggars are just looking
for a free handout and not conflict. Usually i get a reply like 'oh ok thanks anyway'

My rule is: I never camp. =)

11. Never join a pick-up plane raid.

12. Never fight AT the zone unless you are the only party
in the zone. If you stand on the train tracks you are likely to
get run over by a train.

13. Never fight over spawns, if its crowded or camped, move on, plenty
of places to hunt without the aggravation, effort or time wasted fighting
over critters in a freaking game.

14. Never leave a group member after they went linkdead in
a dangerous area. To me its like leaving a drowning man, bad form all
around. I always wait a reasonable amount of time to make sure they
come back or they must have some major technical difficulty and are
not coming back for a while.

15. Never leave a group when a corpse of one of the group is still yet to
be found or retrieved.

16. When turning in items for a quest ALWAYS triple check to make
sure you have everything required, your faction is good enough and
you have the right NPC. "Oh I'm sorry I wanted a star ruby not a ruby" "DOH!"

17. Always try to have fun and remember its a game. If I am yelling
at the screen and getting hot under the collar its time to change my
attitude or my play style. =) The game is what you make it.

18. Always remember the best thing about EQ is the other people
you play with. Also remember that the worst thing about EQ is
the other people you play with. =)
