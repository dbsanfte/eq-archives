yes and clearly here we are talking within the confines of what "pussy" for
wimp means.

We were not talking about what pussy for vagina means, pussy for cat, or any
other definition of pussy you wish to choose other than coward/wimp.  It's
just the same as you saying Sean only thinks "pussy" can be used for vagina.
Nowhere do I say it's *only* short for pussy cat, nor Sean say it is *only*
for vagina, we are talking within specific confines.

If you can not grasp this then it is little wonder that you are also unable
to understand that a word in one context has a different meaning from the
same word in another context.

Thanks for so graphically demonstrating your inability to understand
context, or that you are a liar.  Your call on which you want to be because
I couldn't care less.
