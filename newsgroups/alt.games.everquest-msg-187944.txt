Damn skippy!

The way we run a group is the tanks shield us by hammering on the mobs 
to keep aggro. The druid/shammy buffs and debuffs, and dots. the casters 
nuke and do crowd control. My job as cleric is to keep the tanks on 
their feet and doing their jobs. If they die. i rez them. in between 
pulls as needed i do the donal's armor of mourning 2-step and use the 
buffs. I love my donals, as i can do 3 buffs without mana [just the 
'dots] and can save my mana for heals.

Everybody has to work together as a team, or play is not fun any more. 
Granted at 46, I am not the beefiest cleric around, but I have been 
working my butt off learning to be the best i can be. I have hunted 
dangerous zones and kept my group alive. I don't loot, I med and do my 
job. My reward comes at the end when I get told 'great job' and get 
handed pp and stacks of 'dots. I also frequently get first pick of the 
loot as a reward for being my personal best. To me, that is what EQ is 
about.

Any idiot can get friends to PL them to uber, and buy lots of toys in 
bazaar. My reward comes from people begging me to group with them 
because they know I will keep them alive, and bringing in the loot and 
xp for the group.
