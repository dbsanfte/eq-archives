Wheee! All pure melee are now going to be hybrids.  I'm so happy (not!)

I think the potential for hoseups for this change are way huge.

Other problems include lag issues to take advantage of the "openings"

Endurance acting like mana.  I don't know about other wars but I'm at
0 on the yellow bar after like 30ish secs of combat (buffed sta 295).

Availability of the new melee "spells" is probably going to suck.

*sigh*
