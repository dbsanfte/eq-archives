Hi everyone, I am Ray Powers. I own Gamer's Edge, so thought it best
to reply here.

Nothing. Nothing whatsoever is stopping me from using a key logger. I
can tell you I don't and you can feel free to check out our systems,
but whats to stop me from doing it? Nothing. I would say, however,
that neither I nor any of my employees play EQ currently, so there's
not much value in us trying to take someone's password.

To be honest though, its really a moot point. If someone wanted your
password bad enough they could get it. One script kiddie could just
find out what server you play on, hack a local box or router to that
box, and then sniff all packets coming into the box. Much more
effective, almost as easy, and they'd get 100x passwords than I could
ever possibly hope to get.

True. I really don't have an obvious answer to this question except,
why in the world would I want to? Let's see what I would gain by
getting your password... I could give your stuff to my character,
which I don't have, or try to sell his eq, which would be impossible
for me since I have no idea where to even begin selling things, and
what is good and what is not.

What do I lose from doing this? Well I lose your business. I lose the
business of all of your friends. I lose my reputation, which I take
very very seriously. I can potentially be sued and driven out of
business.

Now that I look at the above paragraph, that part answers the
question. The above paragraph is "what is to stop me from writing down
all the login password combos." I'd much rather keep my store and
enjoy your business then go broke and be sued. :)

I realize this isn't a solution for everyone. But our systems are very
nice, and we have a T1 here in the store for a mere 10 computers,
making us a virtually lag free environment. We wanted to try something
new for a market we don't do much with right now, and were trying to
offer a nice incentive for you to check out our store and hopefully
see some value in being here, both in system and network capabilities,
and in just plain social activities as you can come out and play with
yout friends and meet new one's who enjoy the game.

Ok, I am typing in run-on sentences now, so I better stop. Thanks for
listening.
