I did that not too long ago, might have been a month ago.  A friend 
asked me to come help him get it because he was too low.  We sat around 
there talking for 4 hours and he finally spawned.  I had the pathing of 
the bandits memorized by then so I didn't have that high level one 
'helping'. About an hour before he spawned, somebody logged in to the 
spawn area, saw us there, asked if we were camping him, when we said 
yes, he logged back out.  That was the only person we saw there except 
for the people who were camping the orcs who I kept luring in to buff 
because I was so bored.
After my friend got his, I set my alarm and took a nap so I could get 
one too.  He spawned within 10 mins of the time I expected him.  That 
time I didn't see anybody else in that area but I was only there about 
45 mins.
