Interesting. We've just learned about the neural 4-color processing
(based on 3-color cones) the past couple weeks. I will say, though,
that I am a bit dubious about the 4 cone system being 'default', since
it's not that long ago there were only 2 (red and green split up for
monkeys several million years ago, something which helped tell ripe
fruit from unripe and other advantages. Cats and dogs have only a
short wave cone and a long wave cone, and new world monkeys have some
very odd two and three color receptors.)

However, there's a damned good reason the human eye lens blocks short
wavelength light from hitting the retina - lots of biological damage
(tumors and such - it is more important to wear sunglasses than it is
to wear sunscreen, since the eye has less of a barrier than the rest
of the body). The eye also tries to block infrared - there are people
who have eye conditions that can best be compared with the difference
between a raw egg and a boiled egg (protein coagulation, which you
don't want in your eye).

I'd look for the books I have about this, but too tired right now
after spending 2 hours today looking at someone's optic nerve, which
gave me a headache.
