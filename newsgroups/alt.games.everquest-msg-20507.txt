    Well, it's easy to spell, remember, and pronounce.
Doing a /who all tea on drinal doesn't usually return
all that many results, do it's fairly easy to find me.
Also, I think the names sound good, without being 
overly cutesy.  Others can tell that I didn't just 
accept or slightly modify a name that the generator
spit out.  Also, I've never had a Tea name rejected 
by the selection screen, which leads me to believe 
that it's fairly distinctive.

Annie <--- Actually drinks literally gallons of ice
           tea every week.
