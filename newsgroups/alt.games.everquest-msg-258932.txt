It is not true.  A resisted stun does only one thing, generate hate
for the caster.  This is very useful to Paladins when they tank or
are helping a caster with CC, and also useful to any tank using a
weapon that procs a stun effect (Ykesha augs from LDoN are nice for
this, though Warriors generally go for Anger augs instead).
