They did once.  LONG ago.  That was changed.  Nerfed, some would say, 
fixed, others would say.  But either way, thats the way it is.

Pets all use a 30 delay on all weapons no matter what.  Never slower, 
never faster.

Haste will change the rate at which they swing, but thats not a change 
in delay, its a haste.  Dual weild and double attack may add more swings 
as well, but again, give a warrior with the same skills delay 30 
weaponry and he'll swing at the same rate.

This means that a 30/250 weapon would be vastly superior to a 20/10 
weapon in the hands of a pet, even though every player in the world 
would be begging for that 20/10 combo (my mage would run out and buy a 
Tolapmuj robe and start tanking!) and you wouldn't be able to find one 
in the game that would swing the 30/250 more than once a fight.

Pets do damage based on their native damage output OR that of the weapon 
(compare their max to twice the listed damage on the weapon to see which 
is better), so at low levels there's a vast benefit to be had by 
equipping cheap weapons with a delay of 10 (Fist of Bone, many mage 
summons, both very cheap, more expensive but commonly used a lot Rusty 
Two Handed Sword)
