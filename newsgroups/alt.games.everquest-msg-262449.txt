I think all higher end guilds are running into some of this.  My guild has
made it very clear that the goal is level 70.  When you're level 70, and
everybody else is level 70, then you can complain about not getting help for
your epic while people are doing random grinds.  Until then, the random
grinds are more important than any individual's epic (especially as all epic
1.5s seem to be very self or group-oriented rather than some previous epics
like cleric and enchanter that could benefit an entire raid).

The truly determined will still find a way.  We have an enchanter who was
the first on the server with epic 1.5, and planning her way to epic 2.0, and
she just finally hit 67 this weekend.  =)
