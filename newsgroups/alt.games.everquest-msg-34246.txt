Having used to work for AOL's technical support department at one point in
my life (Hey!  I -needed- the money!!!  =) ), I can say that AOL has
contracts with people such as Real Media, and all that, so that their
software gets installed, as well.  Kinda like Microsoft having a contract
with AOL, so that AOL's icon is in their Online Services folder on a new
install of Windows...  It's a marketing/money-making ploy...
