    Ah, I was waiting for someone to mention res donations! I've been
offered one or two K to go to places I would never go to otherwise, but I
turned them down. The one I accepted recently was Diamond, Black Sapphire,
Ruby Crown, Fire Emerald, Sapphire Necklace, and the Dusty Ransacker's Pack
they were in. When I mentioned I had the pack, he immediately threw in 300
pp. All that to go to Kaesora from the portal of Seb and res someone deep in
the undead area. EASY money. (The guy had trained his own friend, and it was
later in the evening, so guilt and desperation played a big part.)
