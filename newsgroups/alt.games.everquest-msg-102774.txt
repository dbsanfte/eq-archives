After the latest EQW release, it worked great for me until I did one
thing -- I upgraded from 2000 to XP. Now it doesn't work anymore. It
gets as far as the character selection, turns black, then closes and
returns to the desktop. The only variable I have changed is my OS, so
I am convinced that EQW isn't compatible with XP.
