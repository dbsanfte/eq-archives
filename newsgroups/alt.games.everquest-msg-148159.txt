As Jim pointed out, you dont' need to fret over AA points until level
51, as until then, you can not divert any of your reguar xp into AA xp.
Your training points you can invest as you see fit, but many people keep
them for tradeskills and such, since your casting skills will go up
through normal use if you are diligent about it.

For AA, yes, the conventional wisdom is to just get Run Speed 3, which
will cost you 3 AA points, and then forget about it until level sixty,
since no AA skill is worth as much as level sixty with the possible
exception of RS.  That's a good one because it will allow you to outrun
most any normal mob without worrying about having jboots, tboots, sow
potions, spells, etc. PLUS it works in dungeons. It's of great value, if
only for that reason.

You'll need to spend six points on general skills initially. Three on
run speed, three on whatever else you like. Most wizards seem to go with
the natural improved regen (you heal faster) though some take other
stuff like improved bandaging if they solo a lot.

Then you'll need to spen 12 points on archtype skills. (Only available
after level 55 by the way). If your goal is manaburn, then you only have
one choice. You'll have to spend all 12 points on the improved mana
regen ability. (Damned if I can remember the name on one cup of coffee
and too lazy to look it up.) This is a prerequisite for MB.
Then, after 59, you can dump the rest of the points required into your
Class type skill to get Manaburn.

Good luck. I've got a grand total of runspeed two myself as a level 54
wizard, because I just can't break my leveling addiction long enough to
just flush it into AA.
