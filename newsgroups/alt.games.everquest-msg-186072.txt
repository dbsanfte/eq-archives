I'm getting more than moderately vexed at my 2nd pc. After I have selected
my character and hit 'enter world' my monitor goes blank. my character logs
on and stays on as long as my pc is on. I cannot control him, camp him, nor
does ctr alt del or alt f4 work. has anyone else had this?
Spec: Celeron 466, 320Mb PC100 SDRAM, 8Gb HDD, Matrox G400 32Mb Video, On
Board sound that isn't used
Any advice would be appreciated before I throw my pc off a large building
