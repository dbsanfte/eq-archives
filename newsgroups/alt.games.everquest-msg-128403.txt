Note that the "half again" is rounded *up*.
So a level 35 character can still get exp
with 35*1.5 = 52.5, which rounded up is level 53.

Correct.

Uh, neither.

The exp from the kill (calculated as mob level
squared, times zone exp modifier (typically 75-125),
plus grouping bonus) is divided thusly:

  your_exp = exp_for_kill * (your_level + 5)
                          / lev_total

...where lev_total is the grand total of
      (level + 5) for each member of the group,
      including yourself.

I'm pretty sure the lower level gets exactly
what he would have had the mob *not* been
green to the higher level, so none of the 3
choices above are correct.

My understanding is that the exp is always
split as I described above, but for anyone who
doesn't get exp (either because the mob is green
to them, or because they're grouped with someone
beyond 1.5 their own level), their normal share
of the exp is simply discarded.
