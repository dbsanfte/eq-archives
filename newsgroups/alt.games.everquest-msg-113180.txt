Hey, Jackoff Dickwad!

(look, I can change names too, arent I clever?)

You can obviously read english, but your inability to comprehend
basic concepts implies your meds are too strong today; as such
I'll proceed very slowly. then I may repeat myself in d00d to see
if you understand.

Nobody owes you or your kind jackshit, and those samaritans who do
go out of their way to help out rapidly get fed up with the numbnuts
like you who think they are owed a sow because "you didnt appear to
be doing nutting, d'uur, selfish dr00d!"

Hey, guess what... If they're logged into the game, gosh, they might
be involved in doing something. If they weren't they wouldnt be
logged in.

The situation described may be markedly different, but the attitudes
engendered by encountering it day in day out aren't.

Feel free to ask for a sow; dont be surprised if, as sow beggar 76
in the last hour they dont feel particularly inclined to spend their
time hand crafting a polite refusal.

By the way, did I mention FUKL YOU!11! ? Not sure, so I'll add
it again.... FUKL YOU!11!

Jesus. To come here complaining about people being rude, harass
someone known to put their time out to others to provide community
resources of use to all at no expense, to completely fail to even
bother to attempt to understand the most simple of concepts
in the discourse at hand and then to accuse those trying to
explain the circumstances of being unlikable because they disagree
with you and christen them with names like "Fokari"?

You're a fucknut.

Goodbye.

Sui
