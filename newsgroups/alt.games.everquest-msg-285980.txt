While in theory I totally agree with the sentiment behind your question, 
the reality of EQ at the moment is that the population is top heavy and 
if you hope to get consistent pickup groups on returning to the game, 
then leveling is your major obstacle.

This is mitigated somewhat if you have a bunch of friends already 
in-game who are either the same level or who'll group with their other 
friends regardless of any level differences.
