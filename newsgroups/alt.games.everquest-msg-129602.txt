Well, no.  It is *all* about using AI in appeals to
authority as a rhetorical device.  The fact that
it is all about that is easily shown by the
fact that *both* appeals to AI are actually false.

The first respondent made a claim about mass murder
of Palestinians and claimes AI as his source.  In
fact, his claim as stated is not documented by 
AI. The use of AI was merely a rhetorical tactic. 

The second respondent attempted to discount the
appeal to authority by providing another hyperbolic
claim about what AI said, which was also untrue.
In fact, his claim as stated is not documented
by AI.

Both claims are meta-arguments based
on using, and then countering, a common perception
of AI as some sort of authority on what constitutes
a human rights violation, act of terror, etc.

My point is that it is inappropriate to appeal
to AI as an athority at all, because it is
no such authority.

The reasons that is not such an authority are
germaine, and one of these is its idiosyncratic
defnintion and investigation of human rights
abuses.  If one does not accept its definition
of a human rights violation, as with capital
punishment or abortion, then statements about
the human rights status of nations by AI are
suspect.  If you don't like capital punishment
and abortion, you can use any other.  For instance,
the histrionics of AI regarding the GTMO
detainees contains a number of denouncements
based on conjecture about what was done
and about their status.   

It is noteworthy that AI has not updated their 
memoranda since IRC did its inspections.  Moreover
they have taken the rather peculiar stance that
it is a violation of human rights to force feed
a prisoner on a hunger strike.  This is an
interesting Catch-22.  It is a violation of
human rights to allow a prisoner to die of
starvation *and* it is a violation of human
rights to force a starving prisoner to take 
nutrition.  It is wrong, according to AI, to 
feed *or* to not feed.  Doh.

AI does many good things.  It is, however,
an idiosyncratic group with occasionally 
inconsistent conclusions and findings.  It
answers to no-one with respect to quality
assurance, editorial consistency, or external
validation. It reaches broad conclusions based 
on limited data.  

The lack of conservatism in making
accusations and the idiosyncratic definitions
it uses in considering human rights makes
it less reliable and less of an authority
than it could be, and using AI in appeals to 
authority is inappropriate.
