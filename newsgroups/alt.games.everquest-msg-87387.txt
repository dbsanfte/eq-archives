Log in your character and type:

/who all GUILD

If that doesn't do it, type ( several times if need be ):

/role
  and
/anon

until you AREN'T anonymous and AREN'T in roleplay mode, and
then hit [ escape ] and then [ F1 ] and type:

/whotar

Your Guild name should appear to the right of your name
in angle brackets < >
