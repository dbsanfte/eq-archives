Last night I played around in the Bazaar a bit and found two things of
note relating to this...

1) Using levitation as you proposed, it is absurdly simple to get up
on the roof of the trading tents. You can climb right up the slanted
tent poles. And not only can you get up on one, you can then get to
the others quite easily. So, anyone setting up as a roof trader in an
attempt to screw up the market will only screw themselves over. The
cost of entry is a bat wing.

2) The people I found on the roof (four in total) were not price
cutting. Their prices were generally in keeping with what others were
asking.

I'm going to say that anyone running a trader on a roof is not
malicious, but merely stupid. Right in keeping with my observations of
people in general.
