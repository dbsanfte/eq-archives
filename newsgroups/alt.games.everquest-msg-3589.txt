Ok, I made the mistake of buying the game without having noticed, that
you have to pay a monthly fee. How stupid of me. Anyway, is this
payment related to sony providing what? The game world? What exactly
do we pay there? Or can people deisgn their own world and create a
free of cost server or how does this work? I guess I have to sell the
game directly again .. to bad.
