They upped his spawn rate in a patch a few months ago.  Before that, there
were 15 low level placeholders, and the developer said it would take a lot
of killing of them to get Tiny to spawn once a month.  He supposedly tweaked
it to where it might spawn once a week if you go around killing all the low
level mobs in the zone.  I've seen him once after the patch.
