GLS is utter complete crap compared to the worst IR.  IR is like daytime, GLS
is... I can see about as far as I can with my clip plane set and zero with a
sheet draped over my monitor.

There -are- Serpentsight items out there but most of them suck for that
particular slot, or are very expensive or hard to acquire.  A defect that can
be overcome, to be sure, but its still a penalty.

Sucks, since monks are one of the classes that benefit most from regen (others
being necro and shaman) since they have comparatively small HP totals but take
comparatively little damage, and can FD and heal back up fairly well with this
and mend.

A little bit better, not compared to how much worse HP regen they have.  And
monks spend a LOT of time not using HTH

You forgot AC bonus.

Banking was once a concern, but given POP books, is a trivial matter.  You
don't even need to POP to Cabalis, there are banks in POK itself, along with
vendors for most any need.

Pulling monks make good use of regen, since they often end up flat on their
backs well out of range of the  party's healers.  Getting enough HP up to stand
and start running again can be of paramount importance.  IIRC, FD doesn't count
as sitting, so the regen rate of an unmodified human is very low indeed.

Still, I'll grant you that at the high end of the game, the tiny amount of
added regen Iksars get won't matter much one way or the other.  Yet they still
get the exp penalty, which sort of sucks for them.

POP would have alleviated this for you... or close friends who were willing to
hold your share till you got to a bank.  In fact, its best to use that plan
even now, limiting your loot per trip to what you can carry away doesn't get
you rich either!

Is that a Human druid, or a Halfling one (or some less crippled race that
doesn't get a bonus?)
