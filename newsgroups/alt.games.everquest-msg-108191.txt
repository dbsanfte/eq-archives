Twilight sea is a favourite farming spot, if you only have an hour then
forget the elementals (who will prolly be taken by some mid 50 anyway) but
the named Shadows drop some ok items and are classed as undead, which should
make matters easier for you.
See my reply in "need info on groaning mace" thread 17/04

Hollowshade Moor is the latest farmers paradise. Had a 59 cleric come in and
ask for group, can only think he did a /who list for the zone and saw so
many mid 50's there thought there must be something worth hunting, lol.
Anyway, there is a war on between Owl bears, Sonic wolves and Grimlings, the
named of these races can drop some nice items (using the zone to power level
my SK but do farm if there is a spot open)

Good if you are playing odd times, you're not likely to get in if you play
US peak times.

Some Items I have obtained from there;

Elder Wolf Hide
AC10 +4 int/wis/str +30hp shoulders all/all (too heavy for a monk tho)

Elder Wolf Jawbone
11/29 +2 Str/Sta/Dex +2 vs C/F/M -20cm prim only 1hs

From named in Sonic Wolf Caves (spawns in place of Sonic wolf packleader) I
thought there was only one, Growlik, but allakhazams recons the weapon drops
of Howlik, I don't remember 2 different names so I think this is an error
and one is common and one is rare drop.

Brain of the Beaked Bear
AC4 +4 wis/hp/mana +4 vs Disease +4% to med. range

Drops off of Prince..mumble *cough* mumble,  who is prince of the owl
bears...this is no drop so not any use to most farmers if they have better
(I don't so was quite happy)

Fang Shaped Stone Earing
AC3 +5wis +5int +10mana +5 vs dis/mag +2 vs poison
all/all lore

This is off gnurn no eyes, only spawns if you help Grimlings take control of
Sonic Wolf cave (spawns where Growlik would)  I want another of these for my
enchanter but Caves always have wolves and a farmer in them now, this is the
rare I think. Also from Gnurn;

Owlbear feathered spear
7/21 pierce shaman only
AC5 +6 Wis

Stretched Skin Drum
AC3 secondary

Nothing special about this, it is (noticably) quicker than a standard drum
for a bard but mentions no improvement as such.

Preserved Owl bear eye
AC2 +4wis/int +20mana +3 vs Magic range
all/all

Drops off named owl bear (Skrietat'cha) in owl bear caves.

The majority of this stuff is better than I had on my druid or enchanter and
so would/should be welcome for any mid or lower level characters (I love
that shaman spear and that earing)

Warning, the Grimlings and all named have high Magic Resist, a 50th Druid
had trouble sticking anything on the Grimlings until I started using Tash on
them first.
