Haven't watched the show, but I have a friend who adores it, and is more 
slash-obsessed than I am.  If you're reeeeeeeeally interested, I'll see 
if I can catch her online and beg her for a few links.  Her bookmarks 
folder would probably make you twitch. :)

Oh, and if you want the Best Slash Ever (although you've probably 
already read it), go read this page: http://www.siubhan.com/sithacademy/  
The 'copycat' authors are sometimes not-so-good, but Siubhan's (original 
author) stuff is fantastic.  And the first story doesn't even involve 
any slash, so everyone can enjoy.

*snicker* I'm weird, but I'm not *that* weird.
