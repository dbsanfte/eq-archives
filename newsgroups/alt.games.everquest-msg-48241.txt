 After nearly two years of play I have to disagree with this completely.
Sure, if you have little imagination or motivation other than to level
up, all you're going to do is go around "killing stuff". 
 
 Not I. After reaching level 50 and having joined several very large 
guilds gaining experience is secondary. Raiding is primary. Raiding for
very nice items or simply going to new areas I've never been to or seen
is my primary goal. There are places in EQ that are simply awesome,
entire zones empty of people who are adventurous or brave enough to risk 
the possibility of death and a difficult CR.
 
 Sure, when the guild activities are not going on, I find someplace
to go and get some experience but that's not why I log on. I log on
for new experiences, new items for my guild brothers and sisters and
for completing difficult quests. Raiding and questing rarely involve
any XP whatsoever. THAT'S why I log on.
 
 By the way, I just finished the 5th Coldain Prayer Shawl, a very nice
item that only gets better and better. I have not got any XP at all
while working my way through this quest other that the little XP I 
get when I hand in after each part is done. This quest has been quite
varied and interesting as well as rewarding.

 They have? Where? Please provide reference to this. In my experience
Verant has always seemed to try to steer us away from the pure "XP
grind" play style at every opportunity. It has always been a "quest 
oriented" game as long as I've been playing. I have seen Verant add,
refine and fix countless quests. Of course, if you are too lazy and/or
unimaginative to avail yourself of the best part of EverQUEST, you 
won't realize this at all.

 Every quest I have done involved considerably more than that. That's
how they may -start- but quests almost always go on from there. I doubt
you've really done any quests of note.

 I see you are one of the unimaginative ones. Too bad for you.

 Good, see you later. Hopefully you won't be there to ruin my next
quest by killing the quest MOB I need to hand in to like the idiot
last night. 30 people assemble to get one of my friend's last piece
for her long awaited epic. We are almost done buffing up and ready 
to hand in and some Iksar Monk idiot walks in and starts killing
the Quest NPC that she needs to hand in to. He continues to kill it
despite everyone yelling at him to stop, let it kill him and we will
rez him. He kills it anyway, green to him, for no apparent reason,
sits down and logs off. 2 hours wasted for something like 30 people.
5 hour respawn for the trigger NPC. What an ass.

 IT'S CALLED QUESTING. AS IN EVERQUEST. THERE ARE THOUSNADS OF QUESTS.
SOME HAVE STILL NOT BEEN DISCOVERED. GO OUT AND DO ONE TODAY. QUIT 
STANDING AROUND YAKKING WITH WOOD ELF FEMALES AND TAKE ON SOME RISK
FOR ONCE. DIE A FEW TIMES. GET A FEW BUDDIES KILLED. SOMETIMES YOU 
JUST HAVE TO EAT A FEW DEATHS, GET OVER IT.
 
 At level 60 I recently did a quest for a nice item I should have done
at level 20. The item, even 40 levels later is still useful to me.
 
 Get off your ass, out of that boring xp grinding group and go find
a quest to do, this is where you get the truely good stuff, this is 
where you get true satisfaction in the game.
