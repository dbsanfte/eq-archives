No, and I never would expect somebody to hand out step by step guides
for encounters. That is and never was my point.
But dismissing a discussion just because somebody isn't as far
progressed in this game as oneself is hm...pointless?
That's all my analogy was about.

The thing I don't understand is: What are you talking about when you're
talking about encounters? If even the exact numbers you used to defeat
an event could be interpreted as spoilers...
To say it again. Never did I intend to be given an explained script for
any mob. But in can't hurt that much to tell about some "interesting"
things that will happen. Again, not exactly when it will happen just
that it does.

So we have other opinions about "fun". Fine with me though. :)
I like to be given a chance to counter odds. But to achieve this you
have to be given a proper warning. Wiping and examining log files to
determining what exactly has happened isn't something I enjoy.
