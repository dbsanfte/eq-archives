I can't possibly imagine either of those reasons are accurate.  It seems
reasonable to assume a competitor would pop up in reasonably short order
(if the segment is profitable - I assume it is) - emulation of x86 is
not exactly black magic these days.

More likely, in my opinion, is they wanted the technology for Xbox 2,
which - rumor has it - will run on a PowerPC processor.  Since the Xbox
currently uses x86, they'll want some technology in Xbox 2 that allows
backwards compatbility - perhaps that's why they bought Virtual PC.
