I believe he said "others" and not "*all* others.

If the groups already have a bard, what is it exactly the chanter would 
offer at that point which would compel the groups to invite them?

grouping *should* provide the best xp.

Well la tee frickin' da. You should understand, however, that your 
implication by lumping him (us) into the "Nerf calling crowd",  *does*, 
in fact, qualify as name calling or a personal attack. Does the fact that 
you aren't knowledgeable in the finer points of brain surgery, mean I can 
consider you part of the uneducated crowd? Of course not.
