Killing blow doesn't have anything to do with it.. the pet always takes a
small amount of experience.. 1% sounds right if I recall correctly. When
soloing with a pet, the pet will take 50% of the experience if it outdamages
you.

The only reason to ask pet classes not to have their pet up in a group is if
you are in a dungeon with poor pathing.. even then you can get around that
by the new summon pet spells, and by having your pet "guard here."

I regard having a pet (or pets) in the group as having a free tank.. I never
turn 'em down.
