They got me, too...first day Luclin was live.  I was level 47 with my
alt, and had sow potion speed up.  I was able to out run them to
the zone.  I was also the only one in the zone :-).

The worst was exploring Maiden's Eye.  Again, level 47, only person
in the zone.  Hard to find  out that coterie vampyres not only see
invis, but invis themselves :-).  Died 4  times getting my corpse close
enough to the zone to loot.
