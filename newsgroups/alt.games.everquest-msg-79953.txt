The following is a guess and not fact in any way :
Well say that it takes the highest of INT / WIS as base and then adds a
STR bonus.

Ogre Smith Int 60 Wis 50 STR 150
Human Smith Int 90 Wis 80 STR 95
Errudite Smith Int 140 Wis 70 STR 65

Lets guess that the bonus for high STR is on for each point over 100

So with the bonus 
Ogre 60 + 50 = 110
Human  90 + 0 = 90
Errudite 140 + 0 = 140

So it could be true and you could still see great Ogre smiths.

Just a guess.

Jim
