Like I stated before I personally don't practice this "DING" thing, I just
don't get why people would get annoyed with this above most other general
spam in almost any zone you can name.

absolutely not,  that wasn't my point at all.

 Bullshit.

Personally, I don't know as I don't "DING!" or "Gratz", but I'd rather deal
with this occasional zone spam as opposed to the idiots who refuse to take
conversations into private /tells.  You know what I mean, "Hi, so-and-so",
blah, blah, blah...

The point is spam in general, so I don't believe it's irrelevant.  If
someone shouts "Ding" it's only once.  However, you might have one
particular asshole /auctioning  the same worthless piece of garbage over and
over and over again every 30 seconds (you can't tell me you don't ever see
this).

If you don't like spam in /ooc or /shout, shut it off and you will never
again be annoyed by people shouting "Ding" or what have you.
