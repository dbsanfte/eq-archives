Good advice there. A bit of Shaman information to go with that about LoY -
we got 2 new spells which you quest for. One of which is Blood of Nadox, a
poison and disease cure:

The other is a mini Torpor! :

There are new mounts, which are much like horses (which have been nerfed -
you now need the model on to get the sitting mana benifits), but don't have
the head in the way (but do bounce all over the place as they run).

Cheers
