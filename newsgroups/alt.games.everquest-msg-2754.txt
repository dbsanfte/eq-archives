According to the EQTraders fishing board, most areas now have "specialty fish"
rather than fresh fish. The idea apparently is that since most people were
selling rather than using the fish, specialty fish could be sold for more.
There is also rumor (but then, when is there not?) that many of the recipies
will be fixed, new recipies will (have?) been added to use the new fish and
that some quests are in the works to require the specialties. Some, but not
all, of the new fish are edible as is (thunder salmon in the Karanas and green
gill salmon in Toxxulia, for example.) Frustrating changes (my enchanter
fishes for food while medding), but IMO more positive than negative, so long
as the promises are met.
