I like the new armours, I like most of the male models.
The female human looks ok as does the female Barb.
The male human, either erudite, male barbarian look awful, poorly drawn
comic book like characters.
The female elves and half elves have lost their shape that made them elves,
looks like they were designed by a teenage boy whose hormones were running
high.

The animation in combat is now very poor, 2 handed blunt and pierce are now
1 handed in most cases mainly if using a new weapon but even with a great
staff it is now wielded in one hand. Any motion seems to be limited to about
3 frames and is only an arm movement, rest of the body remaining in a
normal, upright, standing position, only exception seems to be hand2hand
where you thru a very slow hollywood style right cross.

IMO Verant have not do a particularly good job with them at all.
