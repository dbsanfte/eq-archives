That is why the analogy breaks down.  The point is that you need not
authorize them to charge you, you already authorized them.

Well I thought it was important to make sure, based on this comment:
"It merits moral and ethical treatment about as much as my keyboard."

About the only reasonable objection I could see is that the charge
happened at a time some people may not have expected, which could have
led to overages and shit like that.  I don't see how you could possibly
think you do not owe them what they charged you.

However, authorizing them to charge the credit card for the account fee
covers all the other stuff you mentioned.  That was the account fee,
charged in two installments, if you like.

But you hadn't paid for them.  You had paid for most of them.

Well that may just be a legal question that would depend on the judge
you happen to get, but in my opinion, the agreement indicated nothing
about when they would charge you, just that they would charge you and
therefore they were fully justified.  I know you disagree though, and
since neither of us is a lawyer (I assume) nor knows of legal precedent
for such a unique case, I don't think we can resolve that issue.
