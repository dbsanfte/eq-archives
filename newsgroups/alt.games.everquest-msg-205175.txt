I think there may be a bug as well. Last time I was trying to solo, I
decided to try a trick someone told me for using animations in PoI. (I
didn't think it would work, and it didn't, but hey, I'll try anything
twice.)
Zone in, /who, only person in zone.
Summon horse, animation, buff animation to the 9s, fix a few of my personal
buffs.
Pick the easier of the two mobs outside the graveyard, pull with tash, root,
slow, dot, sit back while pet beats him a bit.

At about half health (when I was deciding that this wasn't going to work)
pet goes 'poof' as all sorts of wierd things from deep in the zone teleport
on top of him. I don't even get color flux cast before I'm dead. I had a
screenshot of it (quick thinking) and could count something like 12
individual mobs, and I think there were more actually.

This was, oh, 4 months ago?
