I understand your point completely. I'm in the military, where writing and
spelling are extremely important, because everything becomes an official
government document once it is completed. You would not believe the amount
of people who write like they talk, or have no clue how to put a thought
into words on a piece of paper. I wonder how many people were put in for
awards, only to have them turned down because their supervisor doesn't know
how to make a basic sentence.

Too many people rely heavily on spell check to tell them if they are using
the words properly, which it will not do. That was the main point of my
post, that spell check only checks spelling. Yes, it is no excuse to misuse
words, and anyone with an elementary education should know how to construct
a proper sentence. I do use spell check, but mainly to catch my instances of
fat-finger syndrome.

I was the editor in charge of proofreading at my college newspaper, and that
has ruined me to the fact that after about the third mistake I find, I'm
looking for the mistakes instead of actually reading whatever I'm looking
at. Certain articles I can't even start (like a lot in this NG), so I skip
them altogether. My friends take it with a grain of salt, but my new
coworkers are starting to hate me.

>>> Bradmeister, I was using your post as a launching point, I was not
vilifying you or your post. Mea culpa if you thought so.>>>

That's fine. I understand you, and hopefully you understand me now. Doesn't
matter if you agree with me or not, as long as you understand my position.
