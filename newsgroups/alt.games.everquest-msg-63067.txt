Hi,

I have been taking a break from EQ for a while, and I just tried to
log in.  The patch window came up and downloaded some files. Then
after it had finished, I was told to restart EQ because apparently
the patch program had changed.

But now when I click on the EQ icon nothing happens.  The patch window
does not appear.  The computer seems to try to do something because I
see the Windows hourglass and my hard drive whirs, but nothing happens.

Did my patcher file get messed up or something?  The Windows shortcut
still points to the everquest.exe file.  It just does not seem to run.

I went to to EQ folder, and tried clicking on the everquest.exe file
directly.. with no difference.  Then I tried the file for the optional
patch window (optpatch.exe) and the optional patch window appeared like
it always does.  I canceled out of it, and tried each of the other patch
programs, and they all seem to work.

So everquest.exe appears to be the only file that does not work.  Is
everquest.exe the main patch program?

What should I do?  Is there some way that I can re-patch to fix this
file?  Any ideas?

What if someone were to email me a copy of their everquest.exe file?
Would I be able to replace the file and then re-patch the game to correct
whatever got messed up?

Best Regards,

 - Mike Dorr
