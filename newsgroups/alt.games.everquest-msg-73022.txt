As far as I know this is -not- expansion based, rather it was added to the
basic game with a patch quite some time ago.  I've used it with just regular
game
plus Kunark, with that and Velious, and now with Luclin.  I've also used it
with Windows 98 and Windows XP home, the latter in combination with
Velious and with Luclin.. never used Luclin with win98, but thats not
the combination you are having trouble with.

/camp desktop
works just like
/camp
only instead of dumping you to character select, it drops you out to your
desktop.

Just as with
/camp
you must of course be sitting, and you must be uninterrupted for 30 seconds

The command works from the command line or in a social.  If this doesn't
work for you, please describe in more detail exactly what you are doing and
exactly what is happening, and I'll be happy to make more guesses.
