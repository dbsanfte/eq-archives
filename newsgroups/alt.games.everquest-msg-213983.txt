I think what it does is give the ability for classes with the research skill to
research certain high level spells (up to 60) for the non research classes;
primarily cleric, druid, shaman, dunno if that also includes bard, beastlord,
paladin, ranger and shadowknight.  Since none of those classes get the research
skill, making their spells researchable required letting someone else do the
work.

Getting level 60 research components to drop to give you a shot at maybe making
some rare formerly drop only spells isn't a trivial exercise, though, and I've
heard many people say its easier just to farm the mobs that drop the spells in
the old fashioned way.
