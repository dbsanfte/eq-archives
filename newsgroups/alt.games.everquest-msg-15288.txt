So every time when Vox is aggroed while the raiding party is buffing (no 
she can't get to the prep-room), everyone in the party should start 
fighting instantly or be suspended?
Let me clarify that -- this situation happens in about 50% of the pickup 
raids

Absolutely. Giving them a warning, and explaining why VI thinks that 
strategies allowed on antonican dragons are not allowed in Sleeper's 
Tomb would be more than enough in my opinion.

Moreso, Brad admitted that their logs don't provide them with the full 
description of the situation. They have to guess most of it, and then 
suspend/ban people based on their guesses
