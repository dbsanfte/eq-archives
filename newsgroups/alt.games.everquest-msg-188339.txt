True,

but hey! its free, so I'm not complaining. The only one that does the 
complaining was the Colour Laserjet printer at work <evil grin>
I find it terribly handy to see where the approxamitely zone conenctions 
are, instead of just describing which zones are next to which.

Though I think its easy to make, just make smaller gifs of the full scale 
mapes, and put them in the diagram, instead of the zone names :-)
