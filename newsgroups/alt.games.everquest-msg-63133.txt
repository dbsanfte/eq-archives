This does bring up the question of NOT giving your
UAoN to a friend.  What if you just wanted to use that
190/10 UAoN to clear out Droga...everything with one
shot?  Wonder what kind of flag that would be?  Kinda
like the SoW hacks.  I do know a person that is perma-
sow'd, and brags about it at work.  He runs at about
level 70 druid speed (which still isn't as fast as Selo's),
and has been doing that for almost 8  months.  I guess
the lesson is that the stupid cheaters (the ones who
cross West Karana in about 30 seconds) are the ones
who get caught...

But I do go with you on the UAoN...I doubt that would
work, either, just because hit calculations and all the
combat stuff is done server-side, too. Would probably
give the database fits checking up on that 190/10 axe
before you ever swung it :-).
