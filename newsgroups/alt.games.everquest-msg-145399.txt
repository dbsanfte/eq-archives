Early forties I took care of skill-ups at the three giant camp in
FV near the northeast corner of the zone.  The two that are nearest
the zone to [can't recall zone name, heh] can be single pulled, and
Kunark Forest Giants are the only giants I've ever fought that could
be stunned (assuming that hasn't been changed since).  They will take
a long time to kill, and a Verdant will take your lunch and make you
cry so avoid pulling one if it spawns, but with skill-ups as the
purpose of the camp slow kills are fine.  Technique is kinda boring:
keep Divine Purpose up, when you get down to about 2 bubbles of health
Root/retreat/sit and repeat until health improves enough to reengage.
Stay near the zone wall to avoid Drolvarg and Frogluk adds, Root and
run if it gets ugly, never use LH to kill save it for emergency (xp
is slow so death really sucks).  Assuming you have decent AC gear for
your level you can kill the Arbors with a weapon as weak as Ghoulbane
(that's how I got my 1hs up when it lagged), tho I would expect you
to have at least Jagged Blade of Morning or Centi LS nowadays.

Hope this helps.
