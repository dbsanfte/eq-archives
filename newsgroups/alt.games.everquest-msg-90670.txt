This is a really tough question to answer.  Guilds are as varied as the
people who join them.  The guild I'm currently in, Honorbound Elite, MT, is
mostly just a group of friends that tend to chat with each other, help each
other with problems, and occasionally go on raids.  My wife on the other
hand is in a guild that is quite formal, with rulse and regulations, a guild
bank account, with money, weapons, armor, etc., that is open and available
to it's members.  They also go on raids 4 or 5 times a week.   I thiink a
guild is a great thing at any lvl.  Just be careful, and find the one that
has what you want.
