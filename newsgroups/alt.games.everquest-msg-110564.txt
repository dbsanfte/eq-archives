Nexus spires are simple.
In the following zones there is a wizard spire with a Nexus Scion stinding
in the middle:
Dreadlands,
Greater Feydark,
Northern Karana,
Greater Devide,
Toxxulia Forest

When you want to be ported up to Luclin all you have to do is hail that
Scion and type the next line (s)he says, something along the lines of
"Journey to luclin". Then you get a gem. Put the gem in your inv somewhere
and sit on your butt till the Spire itself starts to cast a spell (happens
every 15 minutes or so). There will be warnings before the event but no more
zone-wide afaik. After it starts casting you will be ported in a couple of
seconds en end up in the middle of the zone The Nexus.

In The Nexus there are 4 pads leading to the 5 sites. All pads have a Scion
of that continent next to it telling you where it goes to (Feydwer Scion,
Odus Scion, Antonica Scion, Kunark Scion, Velious Scion).
You simply sit on one of those pads and wait for it to proc (again every 15
minutes) and there will be advance warnings. You do NOT need a gem to get
from Nexus to some place else.

Also note that the Odus pad and the Velious pad are the same. About 8
minutes after it ported to Odus it will port to Velious, both in a 15 minute
cycle.


I didn't know crap about how they worked but simply hailed the Scions. It's
a good practice to hail npc's from time to time, you might get to learn
things or discover new quests :).
