If your friends buy plat, theyre breaking the EULA, so theyre as bad as 
Yantis. Go find new friends.

Ahh, so basically you claim a lot of stuff was posted in posts thats 
conveniently gone now that people wanna see proof. Lucky for you.

Ahh, so you just like to go bash him because you love him? Can only say 
that i havent noticed any increase in prices of the nice items on my 
server. True, i dont look for all stuff, but i seen spell prices go drop 
like a bomb, stuff that i want for my monk dropped a little, and 
tradeskills items are up as usual.
If you were to actually look at what happened lately, a new expansion 
came out. New expansion = lots of changes, and LOTS of money changing 
hands. The first day people sold dyes for 200pp+ EACH, thats just around 
00% profit. Can easily make loads of cash then. And all the decent drops 
from LoY that people payed big bucks for might have something do do with 
it? Or maybe the fact that LoY mobs are quite nice cash cows. Friend (62 
shammy) wanted his mini torpor, so camped the mobs for that one drop 
needed. Took 2 hours, and he made around 1K on that, by soloing. A 6 
boxer in the right spot could make LOADS just in pp drops quite fast.
Or maybe it have something to do with more people getting to the higher 
end planes and getting new loot and either selling the old, or getting 
new dropable loot that can be sold.
