And does Verant do this?

"With the rapid spawn times and many small corridors, there are many
areas to hunt in this dungeon."

But of course, you guys are all so much smarter than the people who
run the websites most of you would be lost without.

Hmm looking at that site shows that they think they are getting the
dungeon exp bonus. Maybe I was just spoiled by Paludal.

Oh here's another funny post: "dont let the gaurds lul you into a
false sense of security, i trained 13 fungoids and about 5 alien
things and a trog to the gaurds at nexus ent and FD'd just to see and
they killed all the gaurds and sat there watching me for 5 miniutes,
all the while i was laughing my head off " Trains are another common
feature of dungeons, yes?

I'm sure most people think the same way of Blackburrow if they don't
hunt there as well.
