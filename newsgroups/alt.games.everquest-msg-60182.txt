You keep saying that Dennis but have yet to prove it. Your the
philosophy major, here your offering an assertion and not backing it
up. There is a level cap of 50. There is no Uber guild restricted
content. Items and equipment wear out so even the best item will need
replacement eventually. How then does this restrict a small group who
takes 5 months to get to 50 from participating in the RvR game as
opposed to the powerlevellers who got there in 2?

With the no level cap thing your  thinking Shadowbane which has a soft
cap whereby after a certain point each successive skill point takes
say for example 30% more exp then the one before.
