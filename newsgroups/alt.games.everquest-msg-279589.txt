	If it struck you as curious, it struck me as the most ridiculous thing 
I've ever heard of :)

	Since 'Shield Block' arrived, the only reason any member of either 
knight class should be using a two hander is that they're not tanking 
(or have only 5 AA's so haven't got SB yet)

	If you're not tanking, your hitpoints and AC take a hell of a nosedive 
on the relevance scale.
