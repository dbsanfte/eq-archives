So far up to mid teens there doesn't seem to be any big time sinks.  Nothing to
maintain.  The only time sink I may have seen, is if you are in a small group,
and you are about to ransack a building, to achieve a mission that the group
member 5 levels above you has.  It may take a while to finish that only because
it's harder, or because you may have to level up first or try to get some more
group members.

I have so far seen two different time based missions, one was you had to wipe a
place within 60 minutes, the next one I had the option of taken, but didn't do
yet, had a 75 minute time limit to it.  The first one was easy enough to do
solo, we'll see about the 75 minute one when I finally pick that mission next
time I'm grouped up.

So far there are 11 servers, and you can make 8 characters per server.
