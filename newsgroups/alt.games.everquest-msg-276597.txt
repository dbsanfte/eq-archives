I'm trying to get my wife into EQ, so I got a second account and we've
started up a pair of Dark Elves: she's a cleric, I'm a shadowknight.
This is my first time playing an actual tank -- though my monk has done
a fair amount of tanking at lower levels -- and I'm trying to understand
how agro works.  I know there are a lot of factors that work into who's
at the top of the hate list, and they include damage done, offensive
spells (besides DD, i.e. dots, debuffs, etc.), beneficial spells cast on
people already on the hate list, distance, sitting down, and probably
more that I'm not remembering offhand.  But the battles we've been
fighting aren't all that complex, and I just don't understand some of
the mob reactions we've been seeing.

In a typical fight, I'll use my level 1 "spike of disease" ability to
tag the mob.  It charges over.  Sometimes it passes too close to my
wife and veers off to attack her.  Okay, so proximity matters, and we
need to learn not to path the mob near her.  (She's mostly not sitting
down much yet; still below the level where she learns Meditation.)
But even if the mob does run up to me, and I beat on it a while, when
she moves up to begin contributing some modest melee damage, it almost
always turns and beats on her before she even takes a swing!

Here's a typical excerpt:

You begin casting Spike of Disease.
a lesser shade says 'Ura anir  teka xeturi sivuela!'
Your target resisted the Spike of Disease spell.
A lesser shade tries to hit YOU, but misses!
Auto attack is on.
You slash a lesser shade for 10 points of damage.
You try to bash a lesser shade, but miss!
A lesser shade hits YOU for 1 point of damage.
You slash a lesser shade for 10 points of damage.
A lesser shade hits YOU for 1 point of damage.
You slash a lesser shade for 4 points of damage.
You try to slash a lesser shade, but miss!
A lesser shade hits Cleric01 for 1 point of damage.
You taunt a lesser shade to ignore others and attack you!
You have failed to taunt your target.
Cleric01 crushes a lesser shade for 1 point of damage.
You slash a lesser shade for 2 points of damage.
A lesser shade hits Cleric01 for 1 point of damage.
You bash a lesser shade for 6 points of damage.
You slash a lesser shade for 10 points of damage.
A lesser shade hits Cleric01 for 1 point of damage.
You slash a lesser shade for 8 points of damage.
A lesser shade hits Cleric01 for 1 point of damage.

About this time I got the mob to start facing me again.  But why did
it change to the Cleric in the first place?  Maybe she's moved closer
to it than I am, but does that really overcome the relative amounts
of damage we're dishing out?
