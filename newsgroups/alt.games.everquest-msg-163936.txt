Dunno if there's anything goofy post-60, but my chars have always
shown a very consistent proportionate change for STA increases that
is class/level dependent.  For the three I paid attention to:
Paladin: (StaIncrease * level) / 13
Warrior: (StaIncrease * level) / 10
Druid:   (StaIncrease * level) / 20
There is an exception to this for very low level characters, there
seems to be a minimum boost of ((STA - 75) / 5) to your hp.  And
I never paid close attention to effects under L25, but I do recall
them changing Paladin/SK hp <above> 25 a couple years back, so it
might be different all the way up to 25 or so

So, if SK constant is same as for Paladin (seems likely):
+6 STA at 50 = (6*50)/13 = 23
+6 STA at 60 = (6*60)/13 = 27

Final caveat:  My highest char is L54, so I can't say for 100% certain
that it's consistent all the way to L60.  It wouldn't be completely out
of character for them to have it work differently at L55+.  And I would
almost expect it to be different for 61 to 65, though perhaps all they
changed was through the addition of the new AAs.
