What, you didn't find any basilisks in Lake Rathe?  Did you look in the
underwater goblin cave?  The aqua goblins keep basilisks as pets, yeah
that's it; and once they have enough basilisks in their lair, the entrance
to the secret cow zone appears...

I'm glad Jeremiah cleared that up.  I certainly intended to send you to the
Rathe Mountains, not Lake Rathe.  Don't worry too much about the Hill
Giants, Cyclops, and Giant Skeletons; the higher level characters usually
keep the population way down.  Besides, I've never seen any of those big
mobs actually come near the Sphinx area.  Trust me on the basilisks.  They
are plentiful and they vary in level, so start on a low blue or even green
to get used to the stun.  By the way, you cannot gate or shadowstep while
stunned.  If I were a caster, I'd root them and step out of their stun
range.  I rode basilisks from 18 to 20 (or 21) with my troll warrior, it was
good xps and I got familiar with a very good zone.
