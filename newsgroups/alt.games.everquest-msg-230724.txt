Should be easy for you.  My human pally got that same band at about 42 solo
a couple years ago with much crappier gear.  Just crawl down to his area
slowly.  Don't try an invis potion because many of the mobs see invis.  Have
endure magic up, and cold and fire resists if possible because the wizards
can still pack a good punch.  Single pull from a distance with Cease to
prevent adds from static mobs.  You will still get adds occasionally from
wanderers, but you should be able to handle 3 at a time.

The EQAtlas map is a bit off on the location of the high shaman.  He's
actually in room 20 with Lynada The Exiled.  That room has 3 static mobs
including Lynada and the placeholder for the high shaman, who spawns behind
the table directly across from the door.

Make sure you keep Lynada's quest drop, which is a small container.  Turn it
in to the vendor in the small hut next to Befallen in WC for some good exp.
You'll also get a key in return which you can delete since it's for a rogue
quest.  Lynada only spawns once every 4 hours though.  You'll probably want
to use a 2-hander when killing Lynada because she has a nasty DS.
