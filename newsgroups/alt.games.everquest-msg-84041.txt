My 38th warrior was grouped with a cleric, chanter and rogue in OT one night
(incidentally, the cleric was the puller.....strange but it was the fastest
pulling xp group ive ever been in) and she had a funny incoming line. I liked
it and copied....but quickly reverted to a simple  "%t incoming" because I 
feared that  /g Oops! I did it again!
	     /g seems like ive aggroed %t
	     /g i guess we'll have to kill it
	     /g INCOMING %t!!!!!

would get on peoples nerves way too much.

Now do that several times a minute and I can guarantee im aggroing my party
more than im aggroing the mob. They were just too polite to tell me to stfu.

BIZBEE: do you have x-no archive=yes set? i never can see bizbees posts but
i can see replies to them.
