Others have already commented on your second question, but to target
yourself you can do several different things:

/target <your name>

Use F9 to switch view so that you can see yourself, then click on your
image

Hit F1 once (for pet classes hitting F1 a second time will target the pet)

Also, you can target any group member by hitting the appropriate key F2
through F6, depending on where they are in the group list.
