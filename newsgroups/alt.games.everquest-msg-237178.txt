Howdy All,

At times I find gettings groups.. or waiting for Groups to form to
just be toooo long.  Any spots were a mage can still go and grind XP
out?  I have done a bit in velks, just takes so many kills to add up
to a percent.  I had done the Brownies in LF for a while, but thats
pretty much pointless now.

Suggestions?
