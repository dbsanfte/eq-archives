Heh, when does rogue stop thinking GROUP, Group, group?

I'm level 33 now (my main char) and things hit seriously hard. Soloing
would range from spectacularly fatal at worst to seriously unproductive
at best. If you're massively twinked perhaps it's a bit different, but
the rogue is obviously designed as a support character. 

And yes, my backstab is maxed. It might rise rarely at a low levels, but
once the skill is reliable the gain rate is acceptable. And since the
levels slow down you end up getting lots of practice.
