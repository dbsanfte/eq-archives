Even though Iike to think I know better, sometimes I go against better
judgement and do something anyways.  Usually rationzalized by saying
"How bad could it be?"

So I take my L18 Human ranger, who is only moderately twinked (Maybe
200 pp bazaar total, plus a couple hand me downs) and has been
exclusively solo to this point, up to Paludal Caverns.  See I'm
jonesing for a new level of spells, and I'm a tough spot for decent
prey without having Panic Animal.   So I go to PC.  I'm only gonna be
there for a bit, and then I'll put it behind me and off on my merry
soloing way.

So I bind in Shadowhaven, and hike on over to the PC entrance.  Its
early in the morning, but I manage to get a bandit group at C1 after a
little soloing of my own.  Decent group, 3 Beastlords, me and a
rotating cast for the other couple spots. About an hour in, some
cleric makes some plat at the entrance by doing a Temp MGB.  Add on
some buffs (Virtue?) on the warders too, and we're killing as fast as
humanly possible.  No cleric, but lots of bandages.

Now, the 1st 2 BL's, they have their stuff down cold, heals, cures,
pets under control, plus they know each other, so it looks like
they're just some alts made up on a whim.  The 3rd BL isn't quite up
to the same level.  He tends to die a lot, and doesn't always listen
to directions.  But he's not pulling, and not getting anyone else
killed, so he's not a complete idiot.  Just unfamiliar with the class
maybe.  I mean I die a lot too, but I'm the Ranger.  I know my role =)

Anyways, 2 hours in, and I've damn near had to macro 'Congratulations'
from using it so much, and a couple guys start stealing some of our
pulls.  One guy is doing all the fighting , so we watch while he
wipes, and then his twink friend starts in ninja-looting the mound of
corpses that was piling around us, and begging us for free stuff
besides.  We're like, "Dude, have some pride".  So a quick /who  <some
moron> shows he's a L1 Barb Shaman in the middle of Paludal bandit
camps.  WTF?  "Buddy Why are you here.  Go to your newbie zone in
Everfrost for a while." 

 "My friend told me this was a good place to get free stuff.  Can I
have some stuff please?  I'm a L1 Shaman."

(Sorry, I spelt that wrong.  More like "C@n I havsum stff plz!!!")

In any event, newbies buddy come back to get his corpse, and they make
for other zones.  Apparently we weren't accomadating enough.  But not
5 min after this, the Barb BL in our group asks us "Can someone show
me the way home? I need to get my spells?" 
 "Home? Which home? Halas?"
"Yeah, I think that's it."
"Umm....Go through SH, take the gate to Nexus, PoK, Everfrost, there
ya go."
"Yeah. I'm not sure where everything is though."
(and myself and the other 2 BL's at this point are all asking
variations on the same questions, so we have a good idea what's
coming)
"Why not"
"Well my friend brought me here and told me to level. This hill is the
only part of the game I know."

(AHHHHH!!!)

Ah well, I Need to sell stuff, and he was a decent enough sort.  He
didn't whine for rezzes and buffs, and didn't bitch about dying.  He
stuck in and got better as the day went on.

"All right, I gotta sell some stuff.  I'll show you the BL guild in
Shadowhaven."

Ahhhh.  How bad could it be.  I knew PC was the kiddie zone, but I
guess I forgot that schools out for until the new year.  Just let me
get my spells and go hunt in The Overthere in peace.

Hey there's the Overthere stone.  What's that an announcement for a
pick-up Vox raid in PoK while I'm running through? Hey I got a 51
Cleric, and might not get another chance. "Hey, got room for a 51
Cleric" "Sure" Hey, how bad could it be, right?
