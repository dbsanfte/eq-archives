I'm currently almost 2 yellow bubbles into LV11 as a Gnome Wizard.
I've got all of my LV12 spells on me (except for Gaze, and 2 others that I
couldn't find, but neither is 100% important at the moment).  So when I hit
LV12 I can mem them right then.

What is a good place to get up a few LVs?  I'm not too worried about money
at the moment, though I'll soon be needing more as I reach 16 and have to
start research.  Which brings up my next question.  Should I start gathering
any certain items or info for this or can it wait until LV16?

And right now I'm in raw silk armor.  Is there something else I should have?
I've seen a few robes in Freeport, but they are all medium size, not fitted
for little Gnomes.

What are good fighting tactics for Wizards in general, and even more once I
hit LV12 and get my next spells.  So far any leveling guides are strictly
for the power leveler who isn't going to have much experience or skill by
the time they hit higher LV.

Any other helpful advice?  I've got about 100pp (mainly from use of the
player based economy).
