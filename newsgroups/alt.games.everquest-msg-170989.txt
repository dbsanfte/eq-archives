At 29 I was killing mechanics in Ak'Anon. (Actually, from 25 - 31 I was
killing mechs) However, there are a lot of choices, and most can be found
here:

It was written before Luclin, but a lot of the info is still valid. Also,
you can go here:

http://necro.eqclasses.com/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=7218

and see where other necros went when they were 29.

Seriously, if you are not visiting http://necro.eqclasses.com/ on a regular
basis, you are selling yourself WAY short.
