It might be a bit late at 54, but something you might want to try would
be to have marrtuk run around and train you up a nice mess of frogs then
ae them (while grouped of course). I ae'd guk for my faction on my
cleric with little difficulty, so if marrtuk can survive the pull you
might get him a decent chunk of experience that way, plus as he will
have initial agro on all the frogs he'll get a faction hit for all the
ones you kill too. I used 2 earthquake ae's and word of ?? if I remember
right and it was fairly easy to channel through an aweful lot of frogs
hitting me.

Also, on our server, we usually would group up everyone working on
faction if there were a few down there. In the times I did it, the only
class that had trouble getting faction hits on ae pulls were shamans,
who don't have an ae. Even then they usually managed to tag enough that
it was quicker than killing frogs on their own they told me.
