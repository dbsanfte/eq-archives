Thanks to all with your help on my prior post.  I hope that there will be
someone just as helpful for this one.  My computer is a Compaq Presario 5000
series (5BW284) PIII 850mhz processor
384-382 MB of Memory upgraded from 128Mb.
The sound card from all I can tell is a:
ESS Allegro PCI Audio(WDM) will be replaced soon, but I hope to get by with
it for the next few months the upgrades so far have been costly.
My Video Card is part of the motherboard it's a:
Intel(r) 82810E Graphics Controller.
I've been though the net and cannot find drivers for either.
My problem is when I re-loaded all the EQ software.  It say I need to
install DirectX 8.0 which I have done.  When I go to load the program it
doesn't recognize that DirectX 8.0 has been loaded.  Could someone please
render some assistance yet again.  I'd really love to get EQ working again
and have further problems once the program is loaded successfully. You Lords
and Ladies have all been quite helpful, I hope that this problem will be
just as easy for you all.

and playing well with others.
