My most recent experience with HP customer support has already convinced 
me not to deal with them again. You are provided with a driver CD when 
you buy the product. Heaven help you should you lose it or buy one 
without the CD, otherwise HP customer support will charge you $20 to 
send you out a new one even if all you need are the drivers for your 
peripheral.

See, providing the drivers on their web page like most other sensible 
manufacturers would cost them money, since they lose out on their $20 
per CD scam.
