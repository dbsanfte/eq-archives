Hope it's true. And this was predicted on our guild boards in a previous
discussion.  It needed to be done.

The benefit for those of us still struggling along pre-60 is that
hunting areas will open up more. The places that are currently sucked up
by one or two level 60's grinding AA by themselves with little to no
risk will now be relatively more free to get.

Besides, why worry about losing your easy xp spot in Seb and Velks or
whatever? PoP may have a ton of spots with mid to upper fifties mobs
that a single group of post sixties can grind away on in comfort and
profit.  New planes, new zones, new high end content... these are all
good things in terms of freeing up the congestion and competition
between the tier one guilds and the up and comers.
