As of the 9th April, they did.

I went to Dawnshroud Peaks at level 24 and spent several hours killing
(mainly red con) shrooms, near the Sanctus Seru zoneline (and getting over a
blue per kill, too).

The level 22 warder normally double hits for 22, which would leave me
practically dead against the shrooms. However, before I started, I went to
the Bazaar and brought a Drakkel Forged Sledgehammer
(http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=30238) for the pricely sum of 10pp.

I gave the hammer to the warder, who then hit for a max of 47 (although I
never did get to see a double hit for 47, the best was 47 and 44).

I logged on a couple of days ago (at level 26) and the trick still worked.
However, I went LD after a few minutes and went back to my Shaman main.

More details about which weapons to give to Beastlord pets can be found on
this thread at the EQBeastlord forums:
