ok, i goofed on the stats ..

the Frozen Orb is better, I agree, but my goal was to get to 200 wis, *then*
work on +mana items =) Currently I'm saving up for GEBs, which will put me
at 209 wis .. I'll be able to swap out a few things, most notably my Ulthork
Vambraces for Azure Sleeves and my Crystalline Belt for a Thick Banded Belt.
I'd also be able to switch from a Medicine Totem to a Frozen Orb for the
extra 20 mana (at level 50).
