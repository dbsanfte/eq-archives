It still crashed without sound, but I found on the EverQuest support 
section to try replacing about six files in my custom skin directory 
with those from the default folder. That didn't work but rather than 
copying the files I accidentally moved them so the patcher downloaded 
fresh files; then I was able to get in the game and play fine. Who knew 
a company's own support pages could provide helpful information?  :P
