Well, it's one of the old old-school titles.  I mean, it's what people talk
about when they say "Yeah, but back then, all we had as a
eleventh-generation copy of Urusei Yatsura, raw... we had to get translated
copies of the script to understand it."

You may be a bit dissapointed in the series, compared to the OAVs and the
movies.  The art is a bit... dated.  It's hard to believe the same Akemi
Takada who did the designs for the TV series also did them for Patlabor...
definately a wild growth in skillz in between the two.
