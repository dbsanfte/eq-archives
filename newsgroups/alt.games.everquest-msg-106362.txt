Go to the Southern Desert of Ro.

There is an NPC who cyclically spawns there named Izera Nkar (or
something like that).

She's red.

Hit her.  She doesn't hit back.  Just keep hitting her.  Your
skills will go up.

I don't know what the deal is with this NPC, but she doesn't hit
back.

Be careful though.  If you stand in front, she WILL riposte (and
it can hurt!).  Stand in back.
