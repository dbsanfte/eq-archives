Assuming the encounter was planned.  There aren't a whole lot of griffons in
the Old World.   It's also assuming the the player was of sufficient level
to take on the griff instead of just stumbling across him.

I hit the wrong spell icon quite often...I'm sure you do, too.  I also have
trouble targeting specific stuff on occasion.  If the critter is already
targeted and I think the person it's chasing is in trouble I'm going to cast
SOMETHING at the critter.  But yeah, snare would have been a better choice.
