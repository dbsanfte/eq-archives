Hmmm... I'd guess this is your first char, and you have no cash for Wis
upgrades... yes?

If this IS your first char, then I can understand why you're fond of him,
but at lvl 15 it's worth starting fresh... and look on the bright side... at
least  you found out early enough what you'd do better next time :o)

If you've got the cash, don't despair... Cleric Wisdom is pretty easy to buy
for, although it's not cheap.
