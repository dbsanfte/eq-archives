jamesgrahame@shaw.ca (James Grahame) done spake :

I should have mentioned that I have a decent set of resist gear in the 
bank.  Half of it is borrowed, but it will get me by for now.

Awesome.  Back when I dreamt of EBoots, I was low level and they were many 
K our of my price range.  It hadn't occured to me to go get them myself, 
now.  I didn't know about the Melee Ring.  I'll look it up and use it to 
entice some of the meatshields.

Karana is the "Rotation Server" and the FGs belong to whomever is up for 
Naggy.  I would have to assume that they are available after Naggy dies 
until X number of hours before he is supposed to spawn.  I'll check on it.

Our guild has been going there off and on.  The loam pieces I have are all 
drops from The Hole that we looted.  I'll get these as they drop.  Good 
call.  If I'm not out of town on Monday, that is when our next Hole raid is 
planned.

Wow.  I've been to US once ( almost 2 times, but it went awry ).  I didn't 
know all that good stuff dropped ( around ) there - I was told it was the 
SCHW camp.  I need more threads, anyway, so Velks is always on my list.  US 
is pretty much perma-camped, so I may be able to get in it, but probably 
not a full guild thing.  I'll keep this one in mind for when I am "alone."

>    Guild raid: Hate. There's still items in Hate worth getting for

Rotation comes into play here, unfortunately.  Our guild can't get into the 
rotation, yet, but we are part of the KCoG, which has a spot in the Plane's 
rotations.  We'll be in Hate and Fear sometime in the next couple of weeks.  
Only 1 Insidious piece dropped the last time I was there, and I lost the 
roll on it.  It was completely YUMMY compared to what I had.

I need to go to LGuk anyway and try for my SMR so I can get started on my 
Epic.  I'll check out what drops the Tiara and maybe go back and forth 
between the camps if they are both open.

*embarrassed look*  I have all the items for this in the bank.  I forgot 
about it.  A friend gave me everything but the beak, and told me to just go 
get one off of a vendor for 20pp, but I refuse to do that when I can just 
go kill some chickens for one.  About a week later, I was running through 
OT to go to Skyfire and saw a chicken and killed it and got a beak.  I 
banked it and forgot about it.  I'll do the quest the next time I log on.

Thanks, James.  Your suggestions are very appreciated.
