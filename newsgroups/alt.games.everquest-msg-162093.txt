So don't play that way.  At 51 there are zones you can solo effectively.
Go there and get 52, isn't that when you get Jolting Blades?  That'll
make you more effective in groups.  I end up playing my Paladin solo
a lot, mostly due to RL preventing me from focussing on many of my
game sessions (nobody likes a groupmate who is AFK frequently), and
Rangers solo tons better than Paladins.  I still enjoy the game, and
haven't had too much trouble finding groups/partners lately when I've
had the opportunity to play undisturbed.  But sitting at the zone LFG
is pointless, if you can't find a group quickly either start one
yourself or go somewhere else.  I doubt it's a server issue, to get
more groups you have to work at it, not just sit around /ooc'ing.

Oh, and please don't top post.
