I posted a link earlier to that very message thread at EQTraders
(http://www.eqtraders.com) Take a look and see what others are learning.
Other yummies...

BB Bear: +2 STR, -1 INT
BB Wolf: +2 STA, -1 INT
Paladin Pickles (sold by Boomba the Big in the courtyard of WF's west gate):
+1 WIS
Pixie Pickles: +1 vs Magic

From what I have read, the "cannibalistic treats" like Smoked Wood Elf and
Hot 'n' Spicy Toelings give incredible boosts. Great, now folks will be
farming the halfling farmers....
