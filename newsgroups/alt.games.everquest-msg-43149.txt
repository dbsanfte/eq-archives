You mean an Import/Export feature, right? (or perhaps maybe a clone option) 
That shouldn't be too difficult, I'll have to think about it and see what I 
can do. 

BTW Quindell, if you want to test it, it can be downloaded from my website 
at "http://www.geocities.com/thorgrud/". At the risk of being excessively 
redundant, I'm going to remind you to backup your opt files before using it 
though.
