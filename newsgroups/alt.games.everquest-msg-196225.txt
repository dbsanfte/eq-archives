As far as I am aware, noone has yet figured out any use for Vampyre
Volatilis Ashes (Heroditus Grolden). Sure, the Zevfeer ones are known,
but what about these?

(OK, I bought Vampyre Volatilis Ashes sight unseen last night in the
bazaar on the offchance, but hey they were Grolden's - /sulk oh well)

I started thinking, and remembered someone in Katta who mentioned
coterie leaders, and I tracked this down...

===========

Vampyre Fangs

Kroldar Strongarm says 'I am Governor Kroldar Strongarm of Katta
Castellum. It is my duty to command the Validus Custodus in matters of
Warfare. The Empire of the Loyalist Combine is currently engaged in a
long lasting war with the Inquisition Combine of Sanctus Seru and the
vile undead of the Coterie of the Eternal Night. 

Kroldar Strongarm says 'I require the fangs of four Vampyres! 

After you bring the fangs (must be apprehensive or better with Validus
Custodus): 

Kroldar Strongarm says 'You have dedicated yourself to the war with
the Coterie of the Eternal Night. I will continue to reward you for
the fangs of every four vampyres that you slay. Should you be
ambitious and skilled enough to confront the coterie leaders and live
I will respectfully grant you the honor that you deserve.

===========

I was wondering if *this* was the handin for Grolden's Ashes. Since
they have no other known use, I'll try it today, but I was wondering
if anyone esle has heard of ANY use for the ashes. I really hope I am
not barking up the wrong tree here, but it is very unusual for a
Bossmob to have a fixed drop every time and not to have *some* use for
it.
