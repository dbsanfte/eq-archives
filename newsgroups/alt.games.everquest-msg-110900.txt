How so? How can capitalism work without the drive to maximize profit? How 
would venture capital work? How would banks or the stock market work? 
Imagine a developer thinking "hmm.. this town centre looks very nice as 
it is, and seems very well served by the locally owned and run stores. I 
guess they don't really need that strip mall down at the turnpike two 
miles away". Nah, wouldn't happen. :)

Lenin was also terribly pragmatic... His original vision was a mixture of 
different approaches and ownership models, from State ownership (of, say, 
natural resources) to communal ownership (farms) and private enterprise 
(small businesses). I wonder what the Soviet Union would have ended up 
like if he hadn't died so soon.
