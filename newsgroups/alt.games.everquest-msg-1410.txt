Yesterday i grouped with a lv 15 Monk in the Oasis of Marr. He told me
that he had a lv 46 necro on the same server, so obviously he was a well
seasoned player. Since i made the journey from Quenyos area to freeport
only a couple of days ago I told him that i was mot that familiar wit
the Oasis. He said that he would pull.

 Well he pulled, actually he was great! 2 bubbles in less than an hour!
But anyways, my question: When he was pulling In group talk he kept on
saying Time to die a caiman, Time to die a allogator etc. And he was
saying it too fast sometimes to be able to type it. Is there a way to
left click on an enemy and type something in to get that saying? Or did
he actually take the time to program all those sayings for all those
diffrent creatures?

This would be a great feature when pulling in a group. I did not get a
chance to ask him how he was doing that. Does anybody know?

thanks in advance
Martin
