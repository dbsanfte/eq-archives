}Affliction: Haste, Efficiency, Extended.....   yes I understand
}dot's... .  So as a:
} Druid, is it all my dot's that last more than 36 seconds?  or is it
}just certain line of dots?
}As a Necro,is it all my dot's that last more than 36 seconds?  or is
}it just certain line of dots?

Supposedly, all DoTs.  (I'm sure someone wil now inform me of the 
exception... :) )  There have been rumors back and forth about whether 
it applies to debuffs as well.  The majority is leaning toward not, I 
think, but I haven't tested it personally.

}now on this line of thought:
}Mana Preservation  - Reduces mana cost of all spells except Complete
}Heals..  Does this work on DoT's? the description does not delimit
}them out, but in Efficiency for Affliction it already does this.

If you have both an applicable affliction efficiency item and a mana 
preservation item, and cast a DoT, the AE will take effect but not the MP.  
If you have just a MP item, it will work for the DoT.
