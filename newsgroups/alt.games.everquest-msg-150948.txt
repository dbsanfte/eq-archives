If you throw in Catana, for one count of three, and then a mana pulse song
for two, you are effectively singing 2 mana songs for 2/3 rds of the twist.
I don't like to twist during down time, will rarely do it unless one of two
things happens.  Healers are oom and health is really low, or I am with some
good friends are we are just grinding away.  After a night of hardcore
grinding though, I can't play Lyrral for a few days, and if I do a marathon
grind with her, I usually take breaks.  That's the one nice thing about a
bard (assuming you are with people you know and in a relatively safe area)
"AFK, fingers need a break, catana, will help with mana, a little bit of
health and sta.  Yellow bar goes down, come near me."  Then I go ice my left
hand (twisting hand) for 30 mins. :)
