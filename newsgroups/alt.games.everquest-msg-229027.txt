Sadly, you are. Trolls and Iksar have the worst exp penalty in the game,
and Ogres not as bad. Which is sad in retrospect, as regen falls off as
a valuable trait when hp increase and mob dps increase enough, around
L50+. Meanwhile, not being stunnable holds up pretty well right into the
end game, though the warrior aa alleviates that a bit.

This ancient link is still amazingly up. It was generated with ShowEQ
numbers back before a lot of changes were made.
