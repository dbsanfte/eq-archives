If you are having crashing/LD probs constantly reinstalling most likely wont
help, as it didn't for me =(  This has been a problem mainly since the 1/23
patch.  Check out the forums on EQ's site, there is 400+ posts since 1/23
with this problem.

See below:

I spent 5 hours in Tech Support chat room since their phone line was busy
all day. Anyway it didn't help and all I got was to send in those 5 files
they always request. Funny thing is the 5 hours I was waiting, 80% of the
people before me were having the same issues. As to this date I have
completely reformatted my drive along with an Fdisk, moved my soundcard
around to clear up a shared IRQ all to no avail. And since the 23rd I cannot
be in the game for more then 3 minutes without going LD, although my
computer just crashes it isnt an internet connection problem.
I have been doing some research and it seems as if there is some Infinite
Loop problem (http://www.viaarena.com/?PageID=64) which I believe is the
cause for all this. Unfortunately there is no one solution to fix it, just
some work arounds. I just dont understand why since the 23rd patch this has
become a problem. They try to improve game performance and fix "hitches"
which I didnt even experience any problems prior and now you have all these
issues like mine.

I have already spent $200 on a new Geforce3 card to replace my Voodoo 5
which was hard to get stable drivers for, but same results.

Also in reference to that Infinite Loop memory problem, no one know
where/why it is coming from. Some blame Microsoft and DirectX/Windows and
some blame Nvidia, Via chipsets for the problems, but they have been
replicated on ATI and Voodoo cards as well so this is why no one has been
able to point the finger.

I hope Verant looks into this and sees what they changed in the last patch
to cause all these problems and why not revert to what they had so they do
not lose hundreds of customers.
