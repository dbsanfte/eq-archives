Guild tag loss was auto, guild leader had a suspension already
on his account so he was one of the few banned.  Given that the
guildleader was also the guild's master tactician, and had devised
the exploit they were punished for, I can't see how it could have
been done any other way.

Probably a fairly sure bet.  Most of Conquest reformed under another
name shortly after their incident, tho the new guild seemed at least
a bit more subdued.  I quit playing on Lanys shortly after that, so
I have no idea how things have gone since.

Well said!
