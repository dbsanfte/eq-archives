Actually as you level up, you'll notice the con message changes. 

It is *by design* that eventually dark blues beat the tar out of you 
with your level appropriate weapons. EQ is designed around groups; and 
there is no expectation from SOE that players should be able to chain 
pull db mobs without downtime.

If you want to beat the tar out of dark blues and not get more than a 
little scratched its your expectations that are out of whack not the 
gear. It is currently "working as intended". (more or less)
