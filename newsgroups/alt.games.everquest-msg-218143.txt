Yes - because what you just stated is utter bullshit. SOE provide a game.
You and me and thousands other share that same gameworld and like SOE. We
have no interest or desire to raking this guys emotions or tearing his life
apart brick by brick, providing him with shotguns, or drive him to commit
suicide or any such tripe.

But having said that - life sucks and shit happens. Most of us take the
"sucks" and "shits" in our strides with varying degrees of grace but
overall, we deal with it and move on. A person already suffering from mental
inbalance or illness may not have the same ability to deal with it and move
on. These seemingly insignificant setbacks to a healthy person may even to
them be the end of the world and they may very well decorate the living room
with white and grey matter.

But where did this inability to deal these everyday situations originate
from? What is the underlying cause?

No - we tell them to stop being idiots and trying to sue everyone else when
chances are they themselves are the single biggest influencing factor to the
unpleasant deed at hand. Ideally, no blame needs to be assigned at all,  but
once a parent starts throwing punches and calling lawyers it is time for a
reality check.

No actually - your example does not even resemble what I have been saying,
this has just been you jumping on the fucktard bandwagon like DarkTyger.
