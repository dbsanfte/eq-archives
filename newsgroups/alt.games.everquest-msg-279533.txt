So, in spite of being a mid-level raider, you're only competing with the
people below you?  I know of a 16k, 2800 AC shadowknight...  but you're
right really, he doesn't consider himself to be competing with you either.

So, in spite of having several full *expansions* worth of progression ahead
of you, you're at the top and the only people you're competing with are
those below you.  Or more exactly, those who aren't even attempting to
compete with you.

Absolutely ludicrous to assert that item progression is not relevant to the
debate after you were the one who started using actual items to illustrate a
point.  =P

Sooner?  Any schmoe can bust out that item on a lazy weekend, with both
augs.  Again, you're not taking into account the *actual* time investment
required to get your piece from Time.

Neat.  You've figured out that raiders have the capability to do
single-group stuff as well.

Now follow that train of thought.  Follow it...  don't lose it...

It's an impossible "problem" to fix, because the raiders *will* consume any
worthwhile single-group content and *still* raid for any other possible
improvement.

On the contrary, it is close enough to Time gear, blows away elemental gear
(in hp, resists and effects, if not AC), and is so many leagues ahead of
LDoN gear, both in time investment and in actual quality, that any
comparison to LDoN just makes me giggle.  =)

Really?  I wouldn't even consider it.  In fact, I have fairly recently
dropped 40 AC from a single item to increase 100 hp, the exact opposite, and
have more than once dropped 20 AC for 40-50 hp.  I know actual tank types
like their AC, but I always assumed it was on a 1 for 10 ratio at worst.

Supple Crimson Choker from PG trials is the obvious answer.  But I'm sure
you find that much too hard (ignoring the fact that if you do it right
nobody gets hit much so quality of gear doesn't actually matter all that
much).

Resonating Anuek Collar in Yxxta is fairly "easy" to get, though you'd have
to do some exploring and otherwise grinding in that zone to get familiar
enough to get to it.

So for lazy asses and those too scared to try something that might be too
hard...

Blue Flame Necklace.  WoS single-group random drop off damn near anything in
the zone (I've seen it drop on both sides of the wall).  There are several
similar items in RCoD, PG, NC, etc.

Now that we've got it settled that there are in fact plenty of single-group
acquirable 100+ hp neck items...   =P

Competing?  We've stepped up to "matching" once you realize there are plenty
of single-group options for ~100 hp (and better) for every slot, and the DoN
50 and 55 hp augs to go in them.  Along with, of course, factoring in the
actual time investment per piece.  No, it doesn't take you 3 hours to get an
item from Time.  It takes you months, and then 3 hours.

A good example of how things change and get easier.  If I were ever to
resent how easy they have made it to get *close* to my level of equipment by
single-grouping, I'd first resent how easy you young raiders have it in old
content first.  I think my guild, of all 65s of course, beat their heads
against TZ and VZ for two months straight trying to master those encounters. 
When we'd beat one, if we even managed that since I always considered TZ the
hardest fight in Time, we'd lose to the other.  Of course, once we were all
level 70 later I led a group of ~35 people to a 4 hour total Time clear.  =P

Since you stretch it one way, I'll stretch it the other way.  35 people, two
Time clears of four hours each, 280 man hours.  Far more than the DoN piece,
and that's if you've got what it takes to match my best Time clear.  =)

Talk about red herrings...  did you even have a point there?  And do you
actually believe that last statement about "any noticeable bearing on game
balance of mechanics"?  Sucker...

I really don't think they overdid the raider-only content in GoD.  Two
zones, Qvic and Txevu, and three instanced encounters, Uqua, Inktuta, and
Tacvi (trust me when I tell you that nobody, nobody, *nobody* goes to those
instances for anything but hardcore raiding).  They overdid the power, which
isn't as much of a concern now that everybody can get to level 70 before
going there.  I doubt you'll hear any arguments about that.

By your asserted standards, there are 12 instanced encounters in OoW that
are out of your reach (there aren't really, but then that would support my
stance so you couldn't argue that  =).

Made an absolute fiasco out of Uqua.   =P

No, there's really nothing charmable in the GoD raid content.  Hell, the
enchanters complain that there isn't even anything mezzable (at the same
time, there is *one* small bit in every GoD raid encounter that absolutely
requires mezzing enchanters).

He's in a pre-Time guild (though was a "part time" raider in my guild
when we were doing Time so he does have better gear than that would suggest,
probably equivalent to yours).  His enchanter has always been his alt (he's
an SK) so is far lesser equipped.  Which suggests that a full group of
elemental geared people (i.e., DoN geared people) should be able to handle
it.

Sure.  It's possible to grind to 70 in places like BoT in truly craptacular
gear.  If you think that you can then jump straight to the hardest
single-group content in the game from there without suffering tremendous
amounts of pain, you have no understanding of the concept of "place".

Nice theory.  Even Sony realizes that wasn't what actually happened, that
that wasn't really much of problem, that the nerf didn't stop the overtwinking
possibility but did make the twinking less effective at the 50+ range, that
it was equally possible to overtwink a shadowknight, for instance, and that
the actual intent of the nerf was to stop "high end" monk tanking on raid
encounters, which was never actually done except for purposes of "rampage
tanking" and only by the very highest of the high end monks.  All in all, it
was a misdirected, unnecessary, overly broad nerf that didn't actually hit
the intended target in any meaningful way, which Sony now admits.

You don't look very closely at tank gear either, otherwise you'd be wearing
a supple crimson choker and saving your dkp for something worth spending it
on.  =)
