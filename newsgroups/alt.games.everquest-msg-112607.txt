With the error your are getting both not being able to login and after
getting to the character selection I would say it has to do with the
internet connection.  I had a similar problem a while back after I upgraded
my modem drives.  You might want to remove all your hardware again from the
OS and then reinstall the basics...then upgrade one at a time trying eq
inbetween each upgraded driver...
Unfortunately the problem you have is just s sucky one in that a lot of
things could be causing it...it could be the route from your isdn line to
teh eq server or it could be something internal.  Start with the modem and
good luck.
