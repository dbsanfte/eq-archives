Since everything in EQ is serverside, the npc AI and everything,
anyone who could make a server which would be anywhere near playable 
would instead just make their own mmorpg. They'd have to be that
skilled. Or, as verant said, if anyone could come anywhere near doing
that they'd hire them since they'd be a God. They already did hire
Rowyl, who I believe worked on ShowEQ or the emulator tie in or
something. He does all the UI stuff and other things.
