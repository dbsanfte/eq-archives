Add in the undead in the forest - several of them in every cycle and
other miscellaneous mobs.  For a short time (1 hour?)  there was no one
in BC and she pulled from there).  But I was there for under 5 hours and
got 6 AA.  She was chain pulling, mezzing the incoming pull, having
us under mana, rizlona's and who knows what else for about half of each
fight (I'd hold my regular nukes when she wasn't there).  For 2 hours
she was also our slower (IIRC - 65 bard, 65 mage, 65 druid, 65 SK and
2 other DPS types - one of them kept having an enchanter friend come
use the highest level augment spell for their haste while we had no
other haster).
