Must admit my enchanter is my 2nd character, my main is a monk.  I
have learnt having an enchanter and now when my monk is in a group
with an enchanter there is two of us shouting use the /assist command!
How do you make other classes understand Mez?
Mainly soloing the enchanter as well, after being told that enchanters
can't solo, maybe not as fast and as quick but definitely doable. 
Tried trade skills with enchanter, having never bothered before and
with 140 intelligence I decided to give it a go, just pumped 1 point
into baking, (great skill whilst medding) and tailoring, and by lvl 12
I have both these skills up to 50 with out much effort.  Love the
ability to go anywhere with illusions.  That's my 2cp worth. Give an
enchanter a go if you have the patience.
