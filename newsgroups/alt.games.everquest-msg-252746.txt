Still sounds more complicated than it has to be, but *shrug*

Yes, but you only have to be the highest.   The more points you have above
the other people who want it... that just means you're paying more for the
item than you would have.  If you had spent those down previously so that
you were just slightly higher, you would still get the good item, but you
would also have gotten at least one more minor item earlier.  Probably
several.

I think that people would be inclined to spend thier points as soon as they
got them, no matter how average the loot was,  to keep from building up
points with no additional payoff.  Have to keep your points low enough that
you can bid on any item.  You may pick it up for just the DKP from one
raid... but if someone spoils you, you won't lose too much.  Raiders who
save up hundreds of points will only challenge you on the ultra uber items,
if any ever drop, because it would mean blowing thier entire balance for
just one item.    And I think once they saw how it was working... that they
were raiding twice as much as you, and getting 1/5 the number of loot
drops... they would start grabbing everything even slightly good as well.

But, lets assume for the sake of argument that you're right, and everyone
buys into the system.   They all save thier points for the big items, and
nobody starts vacuuming up loot drops to begin the cascade.  Then you've
introduced a system where a bunch of upgrades rot.   If everybody is saving
up tons of points, then you can't bid on items unless they're worth all of
your points. Minor upgrades will tend to rot, since nobodys willing to spend
500 points on a 20 hit point improvement, when it would mean having to catch
up 500 before the next flowing thought item drops.
