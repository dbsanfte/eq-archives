Oogaboga - Erm, well a silly but not in a bad way.
Kingofthenoobies is a title and as such not allowed. Titles are earnt in EQ.

It's compuslory for bards to have silly names, it obviously against the
rules for Copyright infringement but although I recognise the name I can't
place them or anything they have done, prolly why you have gotten away with
it.

> Chickenwang 34 Iksar Necro (i just thought it was too damn funny)

Might be a case using the term wang in a sexual sense, I doubt it tho.

> Michelle Jadefox 51 monk (jadefox after the character in Hidden dragon
> Michelle after the actor's name)

Totally Legit, Calling yourself Chow Yun Chan would not be infringement,
Chow Yun Fat would, combining names whether fictitious or real is not
against the rules.
Btw, Michelle Yeoh played Yu Shu Lien, not Jade Fox.
First thing that comes to mind, on reading this name, is Michael J Fox :ï¿½)

> Toejam halfling ranger lvl 30 (i just thouht is was funny)

Have friend with this as a surname, Halfling as well.

> Battlehog Rottentoof lvl 20 troll beastlord (funny?)

Both make good surnames, imo, no other problems, being called Battlehog does
kind of make it sound like you'd have Mattel embossed on you somewhere.

> Shortydowhop lvl 20 mage....gnome (funny?)

Again, I think this is a good Surname, but that's personal opinion, nothing
wrong.

Only one there you'd have problem with is Kingofthenoobies but you'd be very
unlucky get be around when the Ultra Rare, Verant CS rep, spawns to have a
problem with it.

Most of your names I think would make better Surnames but that's just my
opinion.

To be honest I do not look upon the inappropriately named as being immature
or incapable, hell, there's enough of them 60+. I just don't particulary
want to see the sort of names I'd expect to see in Rocket Arena score sheet
in a Fantasy Roleplaying Game so I try not to pay them any heed...just
sometimes I can't keep my mouth shut and have to tell them why.
