The only time I have ever begged for anything...My 3 year old has a
character on the test server and fell off a ledge in Kel and landed in a
tree. She was very distraught and I knew she had fallen off of the ledge
near the bank, but couldn't find her corpse anywhere. A nice bard located
her and his song kept pointing to this tree...and I saw one blue shoe
sticking out! There is no way I would have ever found her as it never
occurred to me she was in the top of a tree <laugh>. I now have a loc hotkey
mapped and have told her to use it often "when her red juice gets low", but
she does her own "nuking and looting"...she can't type yet, but she got to
level 4 by herself =) I think she does well for a 3 year old, haha! Now if I
could keep her away from the merchants she might be able to buy some spells
since she doesn't understand that part of it and buys and resells over and
over <grin>.
