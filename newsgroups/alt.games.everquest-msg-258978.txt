Interesting.   With the (current projected) release date of this expansion
only 3 weeks away, I was moderately suprised by the number of things that
were still "under debate" such as the total allowed level of Flowing
Thought, etc.

Wish a few other questions had been asked though, like "How do you plan on
dealing with the repeat of the PoP problems with raising the level cap? More
specificly, the problem where everything except the PoP zones turned light
blue / green, until there was a gamewide effort to revamp multiple zones,
raising mob levels until they were blue to 65."
