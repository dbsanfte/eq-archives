So instead you'd build a monolith and only care about those who chose to
worship at it.  To hell with everyone else, eh?

Okay, fine.  That line of thought is elitist bullshit.  If you only concern
yourself with those who can play during the 40+ hours a week that most folks
are working, having interpersonal relationships, sleeping, etc. (i.e., the
'casual player'), then you've lost 80+% of the folks out there who may have
become your customers.

Remember, I tried not to say the 'e' word.

Who the bloody hell is 'We'?  Have you been assimilated by the Collective?

You know me not, so you have no basis to make that statement.  EQ is not an
RPG ... it's an elaborately constructed video game.  The only time I
roleplay in EQ is when I'm playing my character on the FV server ... it's a
waste of time otherwise.  It's rather like trying to teach a hog to ballroom
dance ... in the end, it will only frustrate you and annoy the hog.

I am a casual gamer, period.  I have, after two full years of playing this
game, exactly one planes-eligible character.  When I have my 4 hours/week to
play, I prefer not to be saddled with extracurricular 'el toro poopoo'.  Sue
me.

<remaining elitist crap snipped>

I used to respect your opinions, but the crap that flies from your keyboard
in this case is too thick.  Please, what server do you play on?  In this
way, I can make sure not to start a character there so as not to run into
more players who have your mindset.

Good day, sir.
