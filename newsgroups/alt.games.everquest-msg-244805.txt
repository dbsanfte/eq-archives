}>I'd be LIVID if I'd spent ages on a Fabled JBoot quest - didn't they

Fabled Jboots weren't questable.  You had to wait in an 8-hour line for 
the drop, though.

}Ayuh. As I understand it, they were slightly faster than SOW and
}useable indoors.

Naw.  They -were- actual sow, which made them faster than jboots or 
tboots.  And even better, they were targetable rather than self-only.  
Still outdoor only though.  They were nerfed to 45% movement increase 
(less than high level sows, and less than run5) and self only.
