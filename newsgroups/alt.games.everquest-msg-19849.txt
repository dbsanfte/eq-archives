Just wait til 25 or so, Highkeep basement, I went from 25 to 29 in 4 days,
and made about 400 plat, which I promptly spent most of on a Blackjack and
taking up fletching... with 1 day off helping somebody camp Rathyl in Najena
( only about half a level that day, I died 5 times, no exp rez... )

Now I'm 2 yellow from 30 ( yay. ) would've hit 30 in the basement today, but
I wanted to try out the Langseax of the wolves quest, especially since I had
faction farmed Blackburrow at level 19...  ( I can't believe the number of
gnoll fangs just laying around... )

Did the quest 2 times, got 3 blue of exp. for my trouble, and 2
Langseaxes... gave them away to a newbie... along with the studded/spiked
collars I got out of a quick run thru Blackburrow... and made another one of
those funky gnoll bundle cloaks.

Now if only those 50+ druids would stop slaughtering spiders in EK....
maybe I could get my tailoring up...
