Day late & a dollar short, but, when moving EQ to a new computer the best
course of action is to copy over the entire EQ directory.  There are no (at
least there weren't) any key registry entries.  So just by copying it over 
you'd
get everything you had exactly as it was.
It saves TONS of time in loading discs & patching etc....
