No, this isn't about grouping ingame... it's about all those people, myself
included now, who have had flickering problems. Mine's been just fine up
until tonight. Damn thing's falling apart! 3 days ago, the sound stopped,
then just now while I was running across the sand in Ro, the screen started
lighting up like christmas tree lights with a faulty connection. I didn't
pay attention to how to fix this, since it just started... anyone have a
clue?

thanks
