I've been playing for about 2 weeks following the PC Zone freebie. I've
always had an absolute terror of spiders - I couldn't even look at a picture
of one and if a live one came into the room I'd have a screaming fit. I was
horrified at the thought of having to kill Widow Hatchlings but as I have
tailoring ambitions I just had to have a go. Anyway .... two weeks down the
line I'm squishing WHs without a care ... AND  a real spider turned up in my
bathroom, I picked up a shoe and whacked it! I have never been so brave. I
was tempted to loot it but resisted :-)
