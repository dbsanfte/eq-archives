And they were deliberately getting some mileage out of the suggestive 
names.

Its a running Bond gag. From Pussy Galore to Mary Goodnight to Xenia 
Onatopp to Honey Ryder to Christmas Jones... many of the Bond girls

The gag was even lifted into Austin Power's Bond satires... Allota 
Fagina, Felicity Shagwell, & Foxxy Cleopatra.
