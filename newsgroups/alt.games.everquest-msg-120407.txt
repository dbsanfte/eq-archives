While I continually meet wizards who don't use snare, its your primary
function in groups at the high end of the game.  Snaring is such a vital
part of the wizard spell set that you need to make every effort to learn
how it works, how to use it, when and where to use it... and practice
practice practice till you hardly ever snare yourself if you didn't mean
to (in some tight quarters dungeon groups you may have to snare yourself,
far better than letting mobs run off to get help)
