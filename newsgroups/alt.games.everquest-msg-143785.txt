}I'm glad I don't have you for a friend.

Why?  How much more is that than Sunstrike's average price on his server, 
whenever the transaction took place?  Now, personally, I suck at spell 
prices, but I bet if it was KEI, and it was mmm... 5 months ago... and I 
was level 60 and had a lot more cash than I do, I would have been glad to 
get it from a friend for only 20K.
