And in EQ, banked cash makes no income through interest, and hence, there's
no value to holding onto cash in any form at all.

Because there is no in-game living cost, having no money isn't a problem
either.

So the ideal state to be in is to have no cash, every bit of gear you
wanted, but able to make more cash quickly should you find something else
you wish to buy.

It amuses me no end to hear about people with 1 million pp in the bank and
nothing to spend it on.
