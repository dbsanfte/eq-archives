That bridle is No Rent unless you finish the quest by going to either Neriak or
Freeport...  I hope you didn't log off without finishing it!  :(

It is a one shot deal whether you do the quest or not, the only differnce is,
unless you do the followup, you'll lose it if you log off for *I think* longer
than 30 min.

Once you do the followup, then it is simply a one shot bridle.  You toss it
into an inventory slot and right click it and ta daaa horse!  :)

The horse will zone with you *see exceptions below* so do not dismount.  Once
you dismount, horsie is all gone.  Once you log off after summoning horse,
horsie all gone.

If you go to The Grey or into an indoor zone or an underwater zone, horsie go
bye bye.

I did this quest with my druid before I bought a mount because I wanted to try
out the horse and see if the head graphic problems were as bad as I had heard. 
They are.  So I bought a Drog instead.  LOL

Hope that helps,

Joolz
