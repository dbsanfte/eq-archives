Heh ok here we go again :) You can pray with your children in the morning ,
when they get home from school , as they go to bed , take them to church
every day , twice on sundays and holidays. You certainly DO have access to
raise your kids in a religious viewpoint. People who advocate religion in
schools dont want acess to their kids , they ALREADY HAVE it . They want
access to everybody elses kids away from the watchfull eyes of parents.

Schools are good for this since they are GOVERMENT controlled . Control the
goverment control the schools . Radical environmentalism, feminism,
reverse-racism, anti-Americansim are all every bit as bad as religion in the
schools it just matters who is in power when the particular form of
indoctrination is set.

There is a solution that everyone should like ! Let the money go with the
student , end goverment control of education. Since goverment education is
hideously bad anyway this will produce far better educated kids, it keeps
parental control since they have school choice. Monopolies are bad ,
goverment control is bad and yet many still advocate a goverment monopoly
education system. They do this since they want the money they get for it
(without competition prices skyrocket, and quality goes in the toilet ), and
they like the control of indoctrination of all children.
