 So, what would be your character of choice in the RP server?

I'm thinking of a Dwarven Paladin, who's blood runs deep within the Irontoe
Brigade. A holy warrior who shouts "I smite thee in the name of Brell
Serilis!" and who will absolutely REFUSE to help, or be helped by, any
Ogres.

My main question is: how many people will try to get people banned for not
RPing in the OOC channel? :)
