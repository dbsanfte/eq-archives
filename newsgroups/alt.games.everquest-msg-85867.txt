a guildie was rushed to hospital and was left in FG at the city area (his
bind spot)
Somebody trained mushrooms to him, and they repeatedly killed him, he went
from max exp 60 to level 58 during the course of the bind loop deaths,
luckily I got a /tell from a few people in the zone (we were in PoF killing
Cazic) one friend was able to go kite the shrooms, while we petitioned to
have him world kicked.

Are you telling me he deserved to be de-leveled to 1?
