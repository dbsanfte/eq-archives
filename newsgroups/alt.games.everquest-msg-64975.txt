1. MOST of the errors seen with SoL yesterday were due to problems
with the patcher and congestion on the network. Don't rush out and buy
new hardware until you correctly identify the problem.

2. Find out how much free space you have on your current HDD. (Open
"My Computer" and Right-Click on you HDD and select "Properties")

If you have less than 1GB free after install all of the software you
normally use, including SoL, consider buying a new drive.

3. Manually set the size of your SWAP file. Win9x/ME is terrible at
allocating the correct amount of SWAP space.. 
A. Right-Click on "My Computer" 
B. Select "Properties"
C. Select the "Performance" tab
D. Select "Virtual Memeory" 
E. Set the MIN/MAX for the SWAP file to 2X you RAM amount. (eg if you
have 128mb of RAM set the SWAP file to 256mb)
F. Reboot

4. Hit "CTRL+ALT+DEL" after the machine is done booting up. Look at
the list of programs running. These are programs that are loaded into
memory and running behind the scenes. The ONLY things that NEED to be
running are "Explorer" and "Systray". 

If you see anything else write them down, and post them to this
thread. Tech heads like myself can take a look at whats running in the
background and give you suggestions on how to kill processes that are
wasting resources running in the background.

Cheers
