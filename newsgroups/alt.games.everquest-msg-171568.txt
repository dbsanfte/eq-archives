Part of my Druid's way of life, an occasionally useful "trick" for an
Enchanter.

My main is a Paladin.  Single-target chain-stunning is routine in some
circumstances.  I've grouped <often> with Enchanters, I am very aware
of how effective chaining AE Stuns can be and I'd be hugely disappointed
in any Enchanter who wasn't able to recognize the situations where this
tactic was effective.

No I don't, they've already done that to my complete satisfaction.

You're getting quite good at leaping to false conclusions and making
unreasonable inferences.  Please tell me where what I posted implied
the above.  As for "Once the group has determined their needs", I've
been in plenty of groups that hadn't a clue what their needs were (a
clue being at the top of the list, of course).

Ah, so am I to infer from this that you believe that all Shaman are
clueless nitwits who must be told how to play?  That's about the
same level (il)logic you're applying to my words.

You're stretching here James, really stretching.  You started out a
few posts back by questioning my knowledge of the game and generalizing
from that an excuse for players to "cling to generalizations".  Now
you're flopping around like a fish out of water, on the one hand you're
claiming that the moderate depth of my understanding of the most arcane
details of what one particular class can do shows that only a player
of that class can possibly understand it while on the other hand you're
insisting that "leader knows best, stfu and do as you're told".  You
snip the words where I made a clear contrast between the run-of-the-mill
idiots routinely encountered out amongst the unwashed masses and the
sort of players you're used to being with, presumably to avoid the
inconvenience of addressing what I had to say.  You rather bizarrely
insist that group leaders are knowledgeable by default while other group
members are idiots by default (at least that sure looks like what you're
trying to say).  I really don't see why you're so obsessed with beating
me into submission here.  It could be your own competitive nature, or
perhaps you figure you're just giving me back some of what I've thrown
at DT and others in the past, but are you really so sure it wouldn't be
more productive to take a more constructive position?  Nowhere is it
written in stone that all confrontations need be combative.

So far my experience pegs that at 100% correct.  But then what do
I know?  It's not like I've been played the game on half-a-dozen
servers over a 3-1/2 year period of time or anything like that.

Nope.  Not sure why you think that.  I do think that there are far
more morons out there telling people what to do than there are
clever and experienced leaders who know how to mold an effective
group.

I've yet to experience an exception.  Not one.  The self-righteous
arrogance that has invariably accompanied words to that effect has
also invariably been the scum atop a cesspool of ignorance and
willful stupidity.  Your Shaman example above is the same damned
thing I'm talking about, except you've swapped an ignorant member
for the ignorant leader... your group asked the Shaman why he was
behaving so oddly (from your perspective) and his answer confirmed
his ignorance of his class's single greatest strength.  The leaders
I'm talking about don't ask questions, they demand that the Shaman
buff the snot out of all the melees and snap at him when he says
that won't leave him mana for slows.  They tell the Bard to "stfu
and just play manasong" when there's only one caster in the group
and the Bard can have twice the impact by hasting/slowing/attack
buffing/meleeing and/or any fucking thing else he can do to reduce
the number of times the MT gets hit per mob than he'll ever do by
giving the healer more mana to heal the hits that should've never
happened.  (hmm, not too bad, maybe someday I can challenge JFC
for longest run-on sentence of all time).
