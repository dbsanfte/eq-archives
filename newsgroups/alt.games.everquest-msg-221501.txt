Couldn't say 'exactly', I rarely have the presence of mind to check my 
xp bar immediately before dying.

However, I can say that I am a full level behind the Mage now. Due to 
several unrezzed deaths, and that represents quite a bit of time to 
catch up... unless I go find a PL-group somewhere like PC... and I 
really don't care to waste an hour or so doing that.

Oh for sure! No doubt about it.

I actually agree. I realized at the end of my post that putting a raid 
through a 0-xp death for a wipe was too great a penalty. But a 96% rez 
at 65 is more meaningless than a 0% rez at twenty... or a 30% xp rez at 
40  (which is what my bard currently usually gets from the Pali he plays 
with).  Basically... I think that I think the 90,93,96% rezzes were a 
mistake entirely... maybe they should never have gone over 85ish. With 
maybe a Pali like LoH rez that fires once an hour or so at max for 
96-100%...
