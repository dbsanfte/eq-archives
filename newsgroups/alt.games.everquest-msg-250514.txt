I've been wondering all along, what was the point of this summit again?  Was
there something new mentioned, that for some reason could only be mentioned in
person, rather by the countless and endless supply of posts to their official
boards, /feedbacks, and /bugs?  Or was it just to win the "top" people over with
a free trip and free baseball game?

Why?  Boards, /feedback, and /bugs will be ignored from here on out, and only
things at the summits will be worked on?  I think it's is nice they admitted
they have problems, and are seemingly wanting to work them out.  But the methods
in doing so.  They already knew everything talked about in the summit.  Nobody
had to tell them in person.
