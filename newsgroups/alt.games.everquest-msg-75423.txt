It's not just PC's who do that to Izera...while hunting the AC before
as the only 40+ player in the zone, I saw a sand giant whale on her
for literally 2 hours one day.  She never fought back, never got below
99% health, and just stood there or walked non-chalantly around
while this giant hit and hit and hit...I guess he was training hand to
hand...
