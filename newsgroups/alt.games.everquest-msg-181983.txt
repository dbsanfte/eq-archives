And if you've already killed RZW and are flagged for all the Elemental
planes, then one might assume you would be more interested in working on
getting into plane of time. And yet you are spending time killing RZ
again or complaining when another guild(s) kill RZ?

I'm sorry, I was really hoping that through a more thorough explanation
this would turn out to be something different than it looked at first.
But particularly after you've laid out the details of this bazaar
agreement, it really does like Lotus Cult is doing their best to
cockblock any competition and keep the ele planes as much to themselves
as possible. And I do have to agree with Martin on one point in
particular, both in general EQ terms and relating to Lotus Cults "deal"
in particular. I've yet to see an "agreement" like that which wasn't
done strictly with the best interest of the top guild in mind, and
detrimental to any lower tier guilds who are trying to get to the same
content. Same thing with Rotation servers. It's total bullshit, IMO, and
only works to the advantage of the guild making and enforcing the
rotation. FCFS is the only way to go.

And yes, I think that applies to Lotus Cult as well in this case. Why
make such an agreement at all? If you can get to RZ every single time
the encounter is available and beat every other guild to it every time,
then do it! If they want it bad enough, they'll find a way to beat you
to it. But when they do, it's really none of your (or anyone's) business
what strat they use, if any, or how many people they use to do it.  Your
worries about your entire server somehow losing status in the eyes of
the EQ community at large are baffling. Do you really think many people
across the rest of the servers even know who Lotus Cult is, which server
you are on, or what strat you use on each mob? There's maybe four or
five guilds serverwide that carry that sort of an audience, and frankly,
even they are only know to the real game fanatics. I still talk to
people on our server boards all the time who are level sixtyfive who've
never heard of Furor when he's mentioned, and barely know of the
existance of FoH say nothing what it stands for.

I apologize if most of this thread came off sounding overly critical or
even insulting, but man, that whole story of Lotus Cult's reaction to
them killing RZ really irked me. The behind the scenes details of the
"agreement" only made it all the more distasteful.
