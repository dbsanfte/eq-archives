I think the biggest mistake SOE made was making it impossible to solo
effectively once you hit the 20s. You can scythe through pretty much
everything on IoR, had to be a bit more cautious in Qeynos and Antonica
but once you hit 20 and went to Thundering Stepps, good god there was
hardly anything you could kill. Once you found a solo mob it was
invariable one creature surrounded by a bunch of agro heroics!

Why SOE thought once you hit 20 you had to group (and more so needed a
full group of the right mix) is beyond me but that decision cost them
dear.

SOE also got themselves a bad rep with constant and often unnecessary
changes to EQ, over hyped and poorly implemented games (SWG) and "our
way or the highway attitude" to customer complaints. Problem now is the
highway is full of other MMOGs all willing to cater for the customers
needs. Which is why WOW has done so well. Blizzard listened to that the
market wanted and give them a mmog to fit. While NCSoft have spotted
the potential for a simplified non fantasy mmog (COH) and serious PvP
ones (Guild Wars & Linage)

To give SOE credit they are starting to change EQ2 for the better to
address all the customer complaints and wishes but its too late now.
Most people got so pissed off they went elsewhere. Those customers have
gone for good and they aren't coming back.
