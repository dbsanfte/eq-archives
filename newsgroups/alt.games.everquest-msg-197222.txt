Damn. Oh well, it's kind of moot to me ATM anyway, at 53 with 3 AA (Run3, 
what else? ;)

I think for AA I will wait until 55, then go 100% AA and pickup Regen 3 and 
Criticals 1, then go back to leveling.

Martin, in your experience, which second tier AA abilities are best?

On the happy side, I just got a Baton of Royal Stature today, and last week 
I got an adamantite club :) Perhaps I may still be able to solo a bit... I 
don't know yet, but it certainly can't hurt.
