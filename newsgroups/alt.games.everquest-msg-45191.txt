People can do that already, or even with one account, by having other
char camped out there. Very rarely have I been in a group where a no
drop was dropped, and someone had an alt camped out to get it.  Only
instanse I can think of is once in Karnors when a guy had a lvl 10ish
shaman there to loot Jarcrap.  Usually it rots if noone can use it and
noone in zone/guild is able to come get it.

I would imagine is happens at assassin in Guk too, but never seen it.
