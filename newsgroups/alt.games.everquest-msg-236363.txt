Dwarf: Cool running jump animation. Guild+Bank is 2 zones away from newb
hunting grounds. Newb zone is filled with ldon spam, but it's otherwise
a great hunting area.

Frog: Cool spellcasting animation. Starting city is all one zone. Newb
hunting grounds is awesome from 1-6, extra-sucky from 6-10.

Elf: Starting city is 2 zones, but guild+bank are in nearest zone. They're
bigger than the other races.

But really, no matter what race you pick, NO ONE ELSE WILL CARE other than
for role-playing reasons. I have *never* been in a group where folks said
"Yay, we have a cleric! Euugh. It's a your_race_here cleric. No thanks, I
think we'll hold out for a druid/shaman/paladin/necro/bard/ranger healer
instead." It won't matter to anyone else what race your cleric is, any
more than you care about what race the wizard or shadowknight is. So pick
whichever one floats your boat.
