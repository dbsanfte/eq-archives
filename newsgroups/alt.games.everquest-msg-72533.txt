Once you are logged in, EQ uses UDP only, not TCP.  Perhaps they only
count TCP connections?  Or perhaps they only count connections to
specific ports, such as 25, 80, and 110, so that email and HTTP count
as non-idle, but everything else counts as idle.  Actually, if they
are looking at specific ports, they probably exclude 110, also,
because they would not want an email client that polls for new mail
every few minutes to keep a connection alive.

Find a web site that automatically refreshes the page every so often,
and leave a browser opened on that site while playing EQ, and see if
that helps.  Try http://www.worldtimeserver.com/.  That will
automatically reload the page every 5 minutes.

You could also try a web cam.  http://63.198.71.103/kentkam/ refreshes
every minute.  You can find others at Yahoo under

	Home
	 Computer and Internet

	   Devices Connected to the Internet
	    Web Cams

You could also try leaving an email client running set to check mail
every few minutes.  That would cause a TCP connection.
