Destroying your tooth in order to be able to do group TLs to
a zone would be difficult to describe as an exploit.

You can also simply bank the tooth in order to do this.  Now
there you might say expoit, but I say feature.

By the way, following along the rest of this thread, I don't notice
what I've seen happen mentioned: the person without the
tooth doesn't go along, but does end up at the "safe spot"
in the zone instead of where he was when the port started.

Depending on the zone, -this- might be an exploit; a way to
cross large areas of the zone without exposing yourself to
the dangers involved.  Of course in many cases Verant's
idea of "safe" is in serious question...  and again, I say
feature, just one that most people haven't thought about.
Low level Succor!
