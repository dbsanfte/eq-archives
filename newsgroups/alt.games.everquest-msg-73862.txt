You will still need a video card in order to see.  You can allocate physical
system ram to "help" your video card regardless of amount of ram, but if you
get a decent 64MB video card (less than $100) you shouldn't even have to do
this process as it might hinder system performance.  Video demands are best
left to the GPU on the vid card.  That's what they are made for.

Good luck,
Sean...
