If your statement is true then a level 60 ranger could have a chance of
tanking a level 60 monk to death without using spells ?
The ranger would have better tanking ability and the monk better damage
output.
I think the monk would win easily because of those 30 to 40 points more in
defense skills (like level 60 skills compared to level 53 skills) plus the
higher damage output.
