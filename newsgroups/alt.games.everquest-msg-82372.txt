(1) Much less lag, due to proximity of the servers along a very highly
developed fiber optic network between Korea, Japan, Austriali and
Malaysia.
(2) Plenty of Australians speak English, I hear.   That's not such a
big deal as most Americans think, though.  Plenty of Japanese, Koreans
and Malaysians speak enough English to handle EQ.
(3) Plenty of Australians speak a language other than English

Language practice, less lag and plenty of people to play EQ with.
It's a great thing.
