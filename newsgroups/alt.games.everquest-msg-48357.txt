It has changed, there are several options now for bi-directional satellite
connections, however, the latency issue has not changed, if anything, it is
worse, now you have the same high latency both directions.  When I was
looking for broadband, I checked those out, I also talked to Sprint about
their wireless service, they told me that I would not want it for gaming due
to high latencies.  Not all wireless services have that problem, I found one
available locally that has latencies between 80 and 140 ms.  DSL and cable
are both not available where I am.  In theory AT&T@home is supposed to be
available real soon now (sometime last month I was told about 3 months ago),
Qwest, in their infinite wisdom, ran fiber out to my area of town, and will
not do anything to upgrade their equipment and/or lines to allow DSL.
