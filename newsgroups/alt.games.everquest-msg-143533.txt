  Well, alot of people have said levels 50-60, but not like I've ever
seen any of these levels, or, at the snail's pace which I level, am
likely too.  Nor have several other people.  Anyways, I started playing
shortly after Velious was released, so these were always there in my
play experience.
   I'm going to pick something subtle, but that probably touched more
players, of all levels.  I remember when spider silks first started
stacking.  Suddenly, they were worth looting.  This is when it became
alot more tempting to start tailoring.  Then pelts started stacking
too.  Good for smithing as well, now it was easy to hang on to those LQ
pelts for to make padding.  Or sell. Alot of low levels I knew at that
time suddenly started getting alot more money.  I think it was also the
start (well, the start I saw since I started playing, relatively late in
the history of the game) of Verant making things well, easier to play.
