I thought my question was a good one.  Why was the bazaar
implemented in the fashion it was when clearly superior
solutions exist that would reduce server/bandwidth load
for Verant and not penalize users without 24/7 Internet
access?

Fortunately, several people have come forth with some good
guesses.  I'm not sure what you're trying to contribute.
My best guess is you're trying to be funny, and at the same
time, tell me I'm an idiot for asking the question I did.

If you think my consignment shop idea was a suggestion,
you failed to understand my original post.  I'm under no
illusions that Verant would ever consider the consignment
shop approach.  I was merely describing an alternate plan
so that people wouldn't immediately ask me, "How would you
have done it differently?"

: Your post read as a complaint (aka "a bitch" in the vernacular) to me.

If you found my original post to be a complaint/bitch, you
have some severe reading comprehension problems.  It was
a crystal clear "why did they do it this way?" post rather
than a "OMG Verant is soooo dumb for doing this!!!" post.

Good point.  Next time you respond like a jackass, I won't
be surprised.  :)
