Were you playing all the expansions before the break? How about the
new models?

In my unexpert opinion, it sounds like you have a driver problem
interacting with whatever video patches that EQ has put out since the
last time you played (without problems).

If your G400 doesn't have onboard cooling, you might try blowing cool
air on the card -- if you want, you might try carefully touching the
GPU to see how hot it gets -- and see if that makes a difference. If
it helps, you may have to add a fan/heatsink to the GPU.
