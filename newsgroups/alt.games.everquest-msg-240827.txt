Annie,

Thanks for the link; I'm now on the Firiona message board, although I've yet
to make a posting. :) I was chatting earlier with Claviger's player, and he
thinks that FV should be a partial-PK server; he wants players who attack
guards to be attackable by players of the same race as the guard.
Interesting idea; I don't see it happening, but interesting idea. :)

See ya on FV :)
