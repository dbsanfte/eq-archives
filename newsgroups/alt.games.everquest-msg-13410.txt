Unintentional training is not against the rules, and the critter belongs to
the one who engaged it first.

So yeah, strictly speaking I think that if the people it aggroed on would be
Kill Stealing if they got the experience for it.  In practice the group
usually goes ahead and take the kill and bitches out the puller for not
controlling his critter better, a few heated words are exchanged, and the
puller leaves and no /petition is filed.

The puller then knows there's a bunch of KSing assholes over >>> there, and
from now on he's gonna pull from <<< that way.
