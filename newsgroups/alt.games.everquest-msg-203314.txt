*cough*

Insane waste of mana.  Lightning blast takes up to 4 targets and does 477 
points of damage to them.  That's about 425 more than even the toughest 
spiderlings I've seen have.  Along with that, the AE range on it is only 
10, so you'd have to ensnare the spiderlings, run around to get 4 into a 
tight group, then blast away with your AE.  Incredibly inefficient in terms 
of time and mana.

Allow me to suggest using a fast casting, low mana spell (or something like 
a ceramic band) to get the attention of about 40 of 'em at a time, then use 
a point blank DD spell to nuke 'em all at once.
