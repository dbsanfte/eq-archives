Ah, a new mission:  make a Paladin on EMarr and join Ryou's guild.
Better yet, make about 5 Paladins on EMarr and have 'em all join
Ryou's guild *EG*.  It doesn't take too long to level into the 30s,
at which point most guilds seem willing to help with Slowfire...
muahahahaha.

Kaev <--- who does <not> have Soulfire on his main, but does have
it on a retired alt Paladin on Lanys.
