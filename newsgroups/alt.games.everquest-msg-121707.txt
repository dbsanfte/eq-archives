Actually I continue to use remedy quite often as well, its range is much
longer and its cast time deleriously short, and it doesn't have much
aggro to it.  Divine Light is the heal I've gradually discarded, although
you'll get a lot of counterarguement.  To me, its slow for emergencies,
costs almost as much as CHeal, heals for less than Elixer, and aggros
more.  Whats to like?  Still keep it memmed but its the last option, for
when the MA doesn't have time for CHeal to land, Elixer to
work, and is getting beat up too bad for Remedy to matter.


Elixer is a buff, perhaps Extended Enhancement will work on it?  Another
Tic of Elixer would be sweet!  And Enhancement Haste to shorten its
cast time?
