I basically did this unintentionally. Got killed while exp hunting in CC,
grabbed ONE piece of malachite from the bank, headed back in. Saw a Hebalist
as soon as I zoned into CC, cast a pet, killed Herbie. Looted a CCS and some
coins.

So as a mage if I had an equipment wipe I would basically just continue
hunting at my level to restock equipment. All I would need is to nuke
something a few levels below me to get that inital 7sp for a single piece of
malachite and I am back to practically full power.
