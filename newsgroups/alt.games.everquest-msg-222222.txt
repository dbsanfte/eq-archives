   Yeah, that's pretty much my hobby.

   It looks like it's going to stay that way for a while for us.  We both have
jobs now (Yay! Cause it was starting to get grim.  I just maxed out my main
credit card, the one we were using to buy food with.), which are about an hour's
drive away.  We wake up at about 4 or 5 in the morning, and get home about about
4:30 in the afternoon.  I personally am still getting used to this odd thing of
being employed, and have been just staring slack jawed at the tv when I get home
from work till I pass out.  But  I do find myself recovering.  But really, we
aren't going to be playing much save for on the weekends, and even then we
sometimes do chores and such.

   A bargain at any price.

   Yeah, three accounts, but only two computers.  I'd just count on Lenny and
Teapray, and not really think about the Beastlord too much.

   Yes, _you_ are almost to KEI level.  I am already getting better at
begging/bribing for KEI (8).

   I personally like playing a necro.  I have a baby one on Lanys that I fool
around with.  I should imagine that they'd make a fine addition to a mage.
