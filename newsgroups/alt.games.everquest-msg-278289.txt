Yes, HoT.

Whoever has the most hitpoints.  Of course, a 68 necro probably has more
hp than I did when I was pulling there.  =)

It really won't matter for the pulls.  As long as the person pays attention
and moves slow until they get the hang of it, everything is single (line of
sight is very important to keep in mind).  Back at the time I was doing
this, we eventually gave up on pulling cause of gaters and just crawled the
whole way through.

Vindi will be a good test for you.  With those 6 people, you *should* be
able to take Vindi if you play very smart, but depending on gear level you
might really be pushing the edge of what you can handle.  If those are just
your six "biggies" and you have another group of people doing dps your
chances go up considerably.

Thought Horror Overfiend and another burrower (Deep), Itraer Vius (Akheva),
Rhag 1 and 2, and maybe more (Ssra), Grieg (you'll have to figure out what
zone he's in on your own...).  Lots of mobs out there comparable to Vindi's
difficulty.  Vindi is the most straightforward fight though.  Tank, heal,
kill.  If you can take him, then you might start exploring some in Luclin
which had a lot of "low" raid mobs.
