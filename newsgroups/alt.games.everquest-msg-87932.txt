Thank you to you and others who pointed this out. In possibly the most
frustrating moment of this adventure to date, I have now attempted to go
to that page to find the elusive driver information to save me. (this is
after I *did* in fact, uninstall the entire game, reinstall everything,
download all the patches, run the thorough file check, download all
*those* patches, and restart only to get the same error.) 

Now, I go to that page........ it loads the header banner, etc. and
hangs forever and doesn't display the text content of the page. If
anybody is actually able to load the page and could cut/paste the
information in here this evening, I would be most appreciative. I can
load a series of other sony pages, plus the castersrealm page it's
linked from no problem, so it's not my browser or my connection. Just
that one page that I need. As I said... most frustrating.
