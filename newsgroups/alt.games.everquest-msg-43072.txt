The Quest listed below, is for the second Symbol of Tunare.  Its listed as a
fairly low level quest.  I am lvl 39 now, and I've come unstuck.......


This quest begins at the temple in Felwithe.

You say, 'I will slay the Necromancer'

Yeolarn Bronzeleaf says 'The Fier'Dal rangers that inhabit the Lesser
Faydark have spotted a courier making deliveries to the Teir'Dal camp near
Castle Mistmoore and to a necromancer that lingers near the ancient obelisk.
We believe that the crates he carries are supplies needed for the creation
of more Ghasts. Another shipment should be arriving soon. Seek out the
necromancer at the obelisk and take his head then take the head of the
courier and return them to me with the crate that the courier carries and
your Initiate Symbol of Tunare.'

Kill all the undeads at the obelisk (Loc pos50, pos2350) until eventually
the named Necromancer spawns. Kill him, loot his head and head over to the
Dark Elf Camp near the MM zone.

The Courier is triggered through the death of the Necromancer and pops
somewhere near the MM zone. He will head to the Dark Elf Camp. Either attack
him (if you can spot him fast enough) before he arrives at the camp or hope
he/you won't aggro the Dark Elves - they are fairly high lvl (highest about
Lvl 50). Kill him and loot his head and crate.

Its Here that I start to have problems.  The courier has popped in the
middle of the Dark Elves camp, 7 times in a row now, instead of wandering to
the camp as stated, he stands there for a few mins, then de-spawns. Anyone
else tried to do this and had same prob?  The Dark elves at the camp are all
blue to me, except for the Priestess, who is a nasty red and smites me for
214 a shot LOL!  So I can't wander in solo and just blast him.  If the
priestess doesn't kill me, the four other blues will lol.  Harmony won't
work...tried that, unless I was just unlucky? Only tried that the once...
barely made it to zone.

So now I am wondering how I can get at the courier?  Is the quest broken...
or do you need someone to empty out the camp first, or drag them away while
I kill the courier...maybe bring a full group to whack em all?   Or am I
missing something obvious?

Any idea's, tips..insults LOL
