Yesterday I logged in to LOIO with my 22 Bard. Ran around a few Sarnak
Recruits, Goblin Warlords and Charbone Skellies, playing my little
horn to them, 'til they fell over.

Life was good (except for Sarnaks etc). I didnt need to twist, just
play DDD and run in little circles.

Today though, the Sarnaks etc seem to be faster, not much, but enough.
Instead of being able to stay in front of them they can now catch me
up.

Nothings changed, except I got level 23, and the game was patched.
Anyone else notice a slight speeding up of MOBS?

S.

As I lay me down to sleep, 
I pray the Lord my soul to keep. 
If I die before I wake, 
I pray I have a recent saved game to go back to.
