I doubt there's a cap.  And if there is, it must be per-class because
I know I've seen bigger heals than 1700, not even counting Complete
Heals and their cousins.

You didn't mention what healing spell you're using.  Have you tried
doing the math on the spell + focus + AA(s) to see whether it happens
to max out at 1700?  (I.e., if the focus happens to do its maximum
effect, etc.)
