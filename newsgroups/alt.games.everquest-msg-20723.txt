Thanks to everyone for all the info !

I don't always know the level of a dungeon when I encounter it, and sometimes I
don't even know which dungeon I'm entering if there are more than one in the
zone (such as lavastorm or frontier mountains).  I usually hit track as soon as
I enter to get a feel for the dangers ahead in a new dungeon, but I'd hate to
do that and find I'm over my head, the zone's empty of players, and I can't get
out ;)
