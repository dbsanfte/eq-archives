    Yup. And, amazingly, the enchanter that MOST XP GROUPS HAVE has slow as
well! So WHY bring along the shaman over the cleric - for the bonus 5 to 10%
on the slowdown?

    Slow is resisted RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. I WATCH the occasional shaman by,
you know, grouping with them. I watch them get the spectacular failures,
like four consecutive resists on a Myconid Warrior from a 60 shaman. Even
one resist usually sends the shammy into spasms of wincing, which they just
don't recover from that quickly unless they're level 60 or have another
healer doing the Cleric Infuse routine.

>Slow is probably right up there in terms of uber spells.

    Never said it wasn't. But I know the limitations of slow, and I know
which classes have it.

    No, because if said druid is already at 20% health because the shaman
didn't land the first slowdown, he's dead anyways.

    OK, Sang, scenario time: incoming two mobs. The target for mez resists,
beelines enchanter. Who do you think the majority of enchanters want as
primary healer at this point - shaman, or cleric? This is one of the most
common "healer NEEDED" scenarios. Do you want to wait for a slow, and pray
it isn't resisted, or do you want to actually get HEALED? THAT is my point,
one which you keep skipping over - if someone is dying, waiting for Turgur
and a Greater Healing is NOT going to cut it.

    The person who got me into the game was primary healer for his group -
WAR, WAR, ENCH, SHM, NEC, MAG. Great group, they could do incredible things.
HE knew that they'd be better off with a cleric replacing him.
