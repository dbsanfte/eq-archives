Aye, and complicated by range modifiers, presumably.  I suspect range has 
an even greater effect on a snared target.

I'd really love a perma-rooted, non-summoning mob with an exact known 
/loc.  It'd be so useful for this sort of experiment.  Then we could 
position the two competing characters equidistant from the mob, and cast 
stuff, and see which way it faces.
