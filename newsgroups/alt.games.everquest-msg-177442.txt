Some of us still have to. :)

I can understand your sentiments and feel that you have a good point.
For me, finally getting to Freeport, and even Kaladim, as a newbie Elf
was an experience I wouldn't trade. I'm currently on a tour of the
world. I started at Felwithe, traveled to Freeport, went on foot west
to Qeynos, and caught a ship for Erudin. Nice city, that Erudin. I
even took a moment to go visit the Elf outpost of Firiona Vie (the
corpse recovery was not fun when I wandered too far away from the
docks). Despite the thrill of traveling the world by boat and on foot,
and the sense of imminent danger in areas like West Karana (I'm only
level 16), I wasn't complaining when I discovered I could teleport for
free from Butcherblock to Timorous Deep to Firiona Vie since the boats
aren't working.
