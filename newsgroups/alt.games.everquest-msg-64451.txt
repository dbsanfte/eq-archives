Yes. I am having the exact same problem.

Some text in the chat window, depending on color, is blacked out. If I
remember correctly, blue and purple text appears normally but white text is
blacked out.

The view window is blacked out. Appears normally in other all other views
and resolutions. (Figures.)

There is black around items.

Character names in character selection screen are blacked out.

All the boxes are in perfect squares around the individual item/word. For
example... Item would be in a box than saw because Item is larger from top
to bottom and left to right. With a backpack, there is black in the corners
where backpack isn't.

I have installed the most recent drivers for my video (and sound) card and
DirectX 8.1 (In that order.)

The following is my system information:

OS Name            Microsoft Windows Version 4.90.3000   Build 3000
