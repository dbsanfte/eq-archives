There's auction houses (currently three - one Alliance in Ironforge, one Horde
in Ogrimmar and one neutral in...um...Gadgetczan? but Blizzard is working on
linked AH in each main city for each side) - put item up for auction, pay a
(partially refundable if item sells) deposit and it's up for 2/8/24 hours
(higher fees = longer time). You can the go and do whatever you want - camp
out, adventure, tradeskill, etc, etc. If it sells, you get the profits sent to
you through the in-game postal system. If it doesn't, you're out the deposit
and you get the unsold item back through the post.

Voice acting is WC3-esque (stock greetings plus the NPCs get annoyed if you
keep clicking them) plus a set number of voice macros for players. No 100%
voiced NPC scripts, unlike EQ2.
