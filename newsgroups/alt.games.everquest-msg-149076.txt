At 55, a fair number of the Wyverns are light blue.  Hell, I'm there now at
54, and a fair number of them are light blue.  Plus, it only takes a couple
of Druids to pretty much keep the place clear of Wyverns, so on many
servers, much of the time, it isn't that good.

It's OK for me, because I'm usually content with my Wizard to take a single,
and then do stuff on the other computer while medding, but someone looking
for fast XP would probably best look elsewhere, unless he can get on at a
time when no one is there.  (Late at night on my server, I've seen it down
to 4 people in the zone, with only me doing Wyverns.  Then the XP rocks).

I keep hoping that the new Verant, which seems to actually like the idea of
people leveling up, will bump the spawn rate way up in CS.  The Wyverns now
are something like 20 or 30 minute spawns.  They should be 5 minutes (but
cut the loot down, of course, so that people won't be able to farm them for
insance money).
