I dunno. First time I did Fay, I was 52. We were 2 groups plus a couple
more, three (including MT) was 60, most were low-50s... IMO, that
creature is a gimp. That was with 2 clerics, btw, I was main cleric...

And I fell out of my chair laughing when I saw the little thing.
Reminded me of Monty Python...

"There's the fearsome dragon!"
"What, behind the fish?"
"It IS the fish!"
<much laughter and merriment>

IF the MT is low-50s, yes, I'd assume that he'd be hard to take down.
However, the ONLY one who needs to be high-level on that guy, is the
MT. And I bet if the MT is a 55 warrior, it'll be pretty easy.

That's a strange comparison. D'Vinn is an undercon, isn't he?
Faydedar, on the other hand, is a dragon-like encounter. And
as those encounters go, he's easy.

Somehow, I get the feeling that some people don't think that those
in the end-game are Allowed to express their opinions here. Shame,
really, given the amount of knowledge these people more often than
not sit on...

Rune, nowhere near Uber, not even in the end-game.
