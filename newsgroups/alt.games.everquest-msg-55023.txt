I can't see how your star is shining too brightly on the logic side.

"Sorry, but this will not actually stand up to closer scrutiny.  While
you may feel that treating live players as NPCs fosters role-play I
strongly disagree.  Want to know *exactly* what I am wearing?  Ask.
That is a role-play opportunity."

Almost anything can be a roleplay opportunity, including the above. If there
was no /inspect, you could well be arguing that you are missing out on a
roleplaying opportunity, by asking someone where he got his wonderful
earrings. To suggest /inspect has any bearing on roleplaying is totally
illogical. The only thing that has a bearing on roleplaying is a persons
imagination, or lack thereof.


"Bweekle the Gnome is incapable of "clicking on" X`Aridot the Dark Elf.
"Clicking on" someone is not a roleplay action. "

The whole game consists of clicking and typing. How is /inspect different,
in a roleplaying way, from /con or casting a spell, or a myriad of other
actions?

"Exactly!  Take a quick glance at someone from behind a tree and you get
an idea of what they appear to be wearing.  Ask them and you either get
an exact answer or told to go fly a kite or something inbetween.  Do you
really think you could stealthily creep up on me and ascertain the brand
of underwear I have on?"

Even with the /inspect, no-one can tell what sort of underwear you have
on.... can they?

"Even well seasoned adventurers are gonna have a
tough time with that one, but not a click inspection, it tells all.  The
more you try to explain the less logical your argument seems.  At least
Biz admitted that he wanted to know and fuck all if he cared what
someone said about it, you seem to be trying to hide that same belief
behind crumbling walls of illogic."

No logic to the sentence structure here.


"If you sit on a bench and see I am wearing a leather coat can you tell if
its a
Leather Coat AC 3 or a Leather Coat O'L33tn355 AC 33 just by looking if
they look exactly the same?

If you mean inside EQ, then I regard /inspect as part of my ability to
'look', and therefore the answer would be yes.


 "In a world of magic one might find items
that though appearing to be simple every day items, are in fact vastly
different from what they appear. In a point and click world there is
little chance to role-play, but in a world that encouraged  you to
actually speak to folks you meet there would be more."

I don't see how /inspect either discourages you, or encourages you, to
actually speak to folks. If pushed, I would go with the latter, if only to
give you the roleplaying opportunity to say "WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU LOOKING
AT?"


The most illogical thing about the whole situation is why you are not
satisfied with turning your message option off. If Sony did away with
/inspect, how would your gameplay be different, than if you had turned the
message off?  If you have got it turned off, how do you know Sony hasn't
already done away with it?

I wonder if it's just the message that gets some people irate. Would it be
the same if the message was changed to "Peeper is having a closer look at
you", rather than "Peeper is inspecting you"
