----------------
Nope.  keep 'common' but start non-human races with low skill at it -- all
those except humans who start at full skill with it *and* one other language
(combine, erudite,etc..)  Why?  traders lingo for travelers and adventurers.
You are an adventurer from the get go, that is your characters plan so, as
part of your preperations, you learn a bit of the common traders language...

I'll touch on this below when I get to your comments on faction...

not a bad idea but make them race specific, put them out of the existing
areas (i.e. extend the zones in some fashion to accomidate these) and make
them hostile to apposing factions WITH newbie powered guards...  (as was
done with runeyeye but no neutrals unless you have the faction for it)

Also, (would be nice), expand player chars to the NPC classes...  (think of
being a centaur or aviak or cb orc or... <grin>)

Interesting idea but not pheasible in current game...  there is also the
problem (as was mentioned elsewhere) with the idea of a draft check against
funds from...  oh say Kael to Thurgadin?  Gee, I'd like to see the poor sob
who has to go get the cash from the other city at months end...

----------------
> 4) Quadruple the weight of all money and food and water.
>
----------------
No reason to.  Just turn off stacking benefits.  A stack of 20 weighs 20 x
base-weight.  No more '10 stacks of 20' that weigh .1 each --  they weigh 2
each so instead of 1 weight it is 20 weight...

if you are going to play with currency then you had best start looking at
the standardization of coin.  a gp from one place would have different
purity and weight than from another.  having the wrong type of coin would
mean banks would have to convert to local currency, this would entail
currency conversion rates, etc...  best to not go down that road or you open
up a royally complex mess (I can picture some currency broker from real life
setting up a druid to bounce all over the world trying to make a fortune on
conversion rates..  sheesh... <grin>)  just leave coins as they are...

I don't really like this.  It cuts off a legitimate form of income for
players but...  If this is to be done then it would be in the caster guild
halls and you had best have the faction to talk with them...

----------------
Interesting...  Instead though, simply add 2 more levels to the messages
hungry and/or thirsty -- hungry/thirsty lasts for 2 days (we'll stretch
thirst to match hunger...) then you hit 'you are starving'...  imediate
quarter drop in stamina with no chance to regain it (sans by spells but
total loss of regen for it).  fizzle rate is 50% and mana drops to 3/4ths
with no regen.  Next step, 1 day later is 'you are malnourished'  mana hits
half (no regen) fizzle rate stays the same.  stamina hits 0.  you move as if
at fractional health left (sow and other buffs still work but like they do
when you have a sliver of health left) you get first stage of drunk effect
(stagering a bit).

----------------
> 7) Remove 80% of the food vendors.  There should be one or two NPC
> food vendors  per zone.
----------------
nope.  Just make the food they all carry different.  Actually make each NPC
a limited vendor of food in all zones.  'I haven't got much but, for $$ I
will part with some of my rations...'.  same net effect but very limited
supplies from the non-food vendors and still requires faction to buy from
them...  When buying from a non-vendor, quantity and quality would be
foraged levels...

----------------
here we diverge quite a bit.  All vendors speak common / traders lingo.

My idea is, if you speak the native language of the vendor you get a chance
for a faction boost or loss with that vendor (dependant upon skill with
language).

If you are a master of a language then someone who knows it had to teach you
to speak it that well.  If you have high charisma then that shows how well
you can put words together in a pleasing fashion (glib) with the language
(no, not intelligent.  I've met quite a few blathering idiots that talk real
nice... <grin>).

If you are less than master level then you would have a chance of royally
fouling up how you are speaking "pardon me but I saw your mother kiss the
ass of an orc yesterday...  very impressive the way she kissed him all over
the zone"  oops...  that was kick <grin>

Risk with reward.  If they speak well, it could raise faction 1 full notch
with a vendor -- including bs'ing your way past a KOS situation (make cha
and languages worth something in the game...  cha is only valuable to
enchanters in most situations.  Just wait until you hear the Trolls and
Ogres shouting "Looking for charisma jewelry! Paying very well!  Give tells
please!"...

why?  you are thinking very narrow here...  A ranger and a warrior having
problems?  how about a cleric and an enchanter?

Nope.  you were thinking Shadow Knights and Necros vs Paladins and Clerics
yet a Dark Elf Cleric and a High Elf Cleric are both clerics but don't get
along with one another...  how about Barbarian Shaman and Halfling Rogues?
wanna see hair fly?  religion covers a heck of a lot more than "so, what do

Kill a few gypsies and see what you can buy from them...

They do.  you just don't lose faction for killing some of them.  I agree
this should change.  Especially for such beings as centaurs and aviaks.
they are intelligent creatures and they should have factions of their own.

----------------
> 16) All NPC's will give Exp if they would normally.

Not good as stated by others.

I understand some of your logic (why are some NPC's worth fighting and
killing and some not?)  example, king of giants vs dwarves...  Neat quest
items from them but, now go take on the Cleric Guild leader in Rivervale...
your group and the other 2 to 4 60th level groups that it would take to
clear the Rivervale cleric hall out...  No exp, no cool loot...  Also, no
halfling cleric training.  No one for the newbie to take their note to...
Sucks but better to not have this happen than to 'balance' the game by
letting the trainers and other special NPC's get camped...

----------------

----------------
It does now (sort of).  I healed a troll outside guk once.  he killed a
froglok tad while I was there...  I dropped to Threatening from
'apprehensive'.  95% of the time I was OK with Frogloks but 5% of the time
one would attack me and the rest would join in.  I had to get to lower guk
and kill a few undead to get my faction back up from there (about 10 undead
frogloks for 1 tad who I didn't directly kill...  1 level 1 vs 10 undead
wizards and knights?  sheesh... hell of a balance there <grin>).

I think it works for now.
----------------

----------------
got your meaning but no reason to shift this stuff if you allow for a
faction modifier based upon language and charisma...  High charisma with
good language skills could potentially raise your faction (temporarily) up
to 1 full degree...  That should resolve the issue.

----------------
not good...  the 'odd ball' or 'freak' Troll who 'loves those cute little
elves' can't exist in your world.  The Iksar Necromancer who has the Priest
of Tunare save him from certain doom then decides to help the kind elf in
his quest against the dark elves cannot exist.  Nor can the High Elf
Enchanter, be convinced by the Dark Elf Cleric to turn their powers to the
will of the dark lords of death and disease...

Roleplaying is the freedom to explore both within the normal rules as well
as outside them.  The only way you can see the end path in a role is to play
it and, in playing it, sometimes that path can divert to some strange twists
and lead to some interesting tales... :)

----------------
> 20) Some items which have deity restrictions will be added.

Awesome idea as long as no more stupid combos are done...  Sorry.  I play a
halfling druid and the stupidest earings in the game are Karana followers...
Mighty Karana -- lord of storms!  neg 2 str???  reality check...  I'd pull
wis or cha or some other stat but NOT strength nor stamina!   sheesh...
(sorry pet peve of mine <grin>)

Try these extension to it...
Spells with diety restrictions... (like the imbue spells only more
radical -- follow karana?  watch out for lightening...  follow solusek?
fire...  follow Prexus?  water..., etc...)
Strip wizards of the plane port spells and give them to the priests whos god
lives on that plane.  Optionally wizards/druids could get a spell but only
if they have ally status to a particular dieties church at the time they
wish to quest for the spell.  Other quests for the priests can get THEM the
other plane port spells (as in their god grants them the spells to spy on or
attack the other dieties plane)...  (bit of a twist eh?)

with one char per server, good idea.  only problem is with guilds "join our
guild!  we have permanent settlements at all the major camping grounds and
can twink you to hell if you join us!"  I hate that stuff but it will
happen...

A variation would be far more radical.  Add a backlash to effects below
certain levels.  Level 1 guy gets that super cool yak.  first time he hits,
it procs, his inexperience causes the charge to misfire and hit him...
blam.  dead level 1...  Other things would be to make armor level bound.  if
above that level it weighs as advertised.  below that level and it gains
weight...  10 per level off...  at 10 levels below, you suddenly can't carry
a heck of a lot...  Try 40 levels below... 400 encumberance. ugh... <grin>

Fun saying... "Locks aren't ment to keep dishonest people honest but to keep
honest people honest...  The complexity of the lock defines the degree of
honesty you are trying to maintain..."

Not sure what you mean.  all NPCs have a level.  If you are talking about
equivelentcies on some reality schema then bankers and vendors and others of
that ilk would have to be level 1 warriors...  not a good idea.

if you mean how a level 5 NPC can out damage a level 20 per hit then you may
have something but...  that level 5 can't fight a level 20 though it hits
like him on a hit by hit basis...  Still, we beat the npc's all the time so
no big...
----------------

----------------
good idea.  if you are at or above the minimum level then you can fully use
the items.  if you are below then the items should start 'backfiring' as
penalty.  this keeps out the level 1 with level 50+ equipment stuff...

already there in some fashion...
Look at the loot folks talk about from ice giants.  I've looted as little as
10gp plus a gold ring.  I have also looted 2 semi-precious gems, 2 fs
weapons and over 50pp cash from another one.  Look at the trainer on the
hill in crushbone...  how often does he drop that shield vs how often does
he drop what and how much?

seems covered in my book...

Again, this stops the 'conversions' where the good guy becomes evil and the
evil guy becomes good...  it would run backwards.  A good guy couldn't try
and 'convert' an evil fellow because the 'here is the power of the light'
would begin to make him evil...  same in reverse...  'see the power you get

I disagree on exp loss and agree with faction.  You kill someone and you
take faction hits for whatever factions that person is 'warmly' or higher
with.  You get exp from killing them the same as you do from a MOB of the
same level.  You get killed and you lose full exp the same as if by a MOB.
You get killed and your entire inventory is open.  For casters, the spell
book can be looted / destroyed (poor level 60 that gets almost killed by a
mob then jumped by a group of newbies...  they get a full spell book of
scrolls to sell off)...  No free murderers in the game and no free rides.
You want PvP then make it PvP.

Alternately PvP flag like it is now on production servers and whine to
someone else about the fact you can't camp the newbies in another zone -or-
sit at the zone in point and blast folks as they come into a zone, etc...

No zone wide communications at all.  OOC, Shout and Auction all have the

Neat... so a level 60 hits a newbie zone.  buffs a newbie up with full buffs
and watches as the newbie gets their first 6 levels in under a half an hour.
Then they just repeat for an hour longer and that newbie is now 10th to 15th
level...  Not a bad idea...  seeing a level 1 warrior with resistances over
100, stats over 150, hp over 1000 a damage shield that kills on contact
anything up to 6 levels higher than they are...

Don't just look at the mid levels but look at the lower levels too...
clarity 2 is your thought but think what a 35dmg shield would do on a newbie
with uber stats...  you could literally buff a level 3 to walk into crush
castle and clear the throne room then take dvinn and crush...  just a few
heavy buffs on them and instantly they are over 15 to 20 levels higher in
ability...  (yes, there are monster buffs out there...  My wimpy halfling
druid had 175 str after a single buff from a level 60 shaman...  what would
a level 1 do with all that power?  want to talk about unbalancing the game?)

Not without permission by the player.  Bind is a weapon if it isn't
consented to and is open.  Picture a warrior who gets in an argument with
the magi.  It ends and they go back to the raid on naggy, the magi (still
ticked off) now binds the warrior who doesn't notice in the heat of
battle...  everyone leaves.  everything goes on.  the next day the warrior
logs on, goes hunting, gets killed and his bind spot pops him onto a lonely
naggy...  60 -- dead... dead... dead... dead... (59) repeat...

Well, I guess there goes your ride if you don't know anyone...  "Can you

None of the above scenarios may be against roleplay modes...  "The enemy of

played characters, in role play mode...

Velious is an awesome place for the most part.  It has some serious pathing
issues in some spots (so do some older areas) but, all in all it isn't bad.

Now the "let's make the trees move a little" graphics that bog down the
outdoor zones kind of sucks and the new creatures that 'cannot have it's
speed changed' kind of suck but, all in all, velious is a great expansion to
the game... (iceclad ocean, great divide, eastern wastelands, etc...)
