Greater lightstones, and all other light sources, suck compared to even 
the least of the vision enhancements; Serpentsight.  Back when night 
blind was really night blind, even a greater light stone usually did no 
more than paint a couple sections of the ground near you bright enough 
to see; as you might expect, it did nothing for anything any real 
distance from you.  Serpentsight, on the other hand, or playing a race 
with infravision, is so good that in most zones you can't tell the 
difference between night and day (things get a little redder at night). 
Ultravision is marginally better, but basically the same in most zones, 
(only things get a little bluer at night) and Plainsight, which my mage 
normally has on due to his Orb of Exploration summon, is marginally 
better than that (looks like slightly washed out daylight), plus lets 
you see invis.
