I have a couple questions that I can't figure out...

How do you choose yourself to be the 'target', so you can bind wounds on
yourself and cast spell on yourself?

Those warriors who started in Qeynos, after I gave the 5 bat wings and snake
scales in a bag to the NPC who asked for them, it didn't seem like anything
happened...was I supposed to say something to him first?

Thanks,

JD
