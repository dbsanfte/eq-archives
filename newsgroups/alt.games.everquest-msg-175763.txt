And the lag was unbelievable !

My (old) gold everquest arrived yesterday, I quickly installed it, and
headed off to the bazaar. And yes the lag was just hideous. I guess
it's to be expected with hundreds of players in the same small area. 

It's quite a good system, I don't have to run around looking at every
vendor, just type in  /bazaar and you can search for what you want.

Anyway I looked at all the 1H slashing weapons on offer within my
price range and finally settled on a blackened alloy longsword for
30PP. I was also looking at runed falchion for the same price.

I eventually lagged over to the vendor, bought the sword, and made my
way back to the nexus. A fellow there was offering ports to surefall
glade for donations, So I wandered over to him asked about it. He
grouped me and the next thing I know i'm in surefall glade. I asked
him how much is the going rate for ports, he said 10pp, but don't
worry about it as your a newbie (people are so nice in EQ, big change
from UO).

I've had a bit of a play with it so far, my damage seems to be hitting
20-22, a lot more than 13 max I used to get with the fine steel
longsword. So I should be a lot more effective now :)
