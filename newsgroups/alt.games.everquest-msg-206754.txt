Just wanted to add my "me too" statement - the Gulf of Gunthak is great solo
XP for a 39 pally.  Hit the beach (left side is best).  Tons of dark blue
mobs that are relatively easy to pull singly if you're careful.  They
*don't* cast and *don't* run, so you pull them to some safe spot and then
beat away at them until they fall over.  Your mana will only be used to heal
yourself (and to refresh IoN and to Yaulp constantly, of course), so even
with the recent KEI nerf (er, bug fix), you should be able to keep a decent
area cleared of mobs.

You're also perfectly placed to do your Celestial Cleansing quest once you
hit 44.  I'd actually wait until you hit 45 so you can grab a KEI.

The only downside to Gunthak is that it's *so* out of the way.  For safety's
sake you should bind at the lighthouse, which means a long run if you even
need to leave.  Still, once you've figured out how to navigate the Warrens
it's not so bad to get back and forth.
