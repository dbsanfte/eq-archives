    The guilds I "dislike" are just the same. A few buttheads, and a few
people that follow the buttheads. I wish the griefers would go away, but I'm
sure they think the same about everyone they dislike, too.

    The trouble isn't reputation. It's flags. All the big guilds had it -
unless someone was flagged, they couldn't raid with you, so you couldn't
evaluate them. And the only people WITH the flags are in your guild, or
perhaps the close competition. With the changes in today's patch, look for a
new recruitment drive to begin.

    You have to watch it. There's a lot of work that has to be done in each
elemental plane before you can complete a god encounter. It may look like a
given guild has done only one more mob than you, but then they kill god X
and you realize you haven't even started the quest let alone geared your
people up to take the encounter.

    I had the same misgivings about my server's uberguild when I was LFG.
And sure enough, after time the guild I joined passed them. Now it's your
turn. =)
