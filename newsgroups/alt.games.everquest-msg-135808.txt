Did you even stop to give a quick shout that you'd found some stuff on
the ground, then let someone prove it was indeed their stuff, by
telling you what was in the bag?  Not according to your post.  Did you
stop to think of how sick YOU would feel, if you'd lost the items in
question?  Certainly not according to this post.  Gratz on your "best
night ever".  Jerk.
