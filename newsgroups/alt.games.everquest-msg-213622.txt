for whatever reason, i logged into stromm tonight to mess around

and as i ran through PoK, shopping for a nice noob zone to play in, i ran
past someone with their AA title

sage soandso . . .right in front of me...63 chanty .....

i saw 2 others with titles .. and too many 65's to report

my heart broke....

how old is stromm? how could it happen that over the summer, a good number
of people have accomplished something like max xp and class AA ?

i didn't accomplish anything that i could brag about in the last 2 months

i've spent my years in eq bouncing around lots of characters . . i COULD
have had max xp and aa titles on 2 or 3 chars, but instead i have 9
characters mid-high lvls....i don't regret how i spent my time; it was my
choice and i'm happy that my experience was so broad

but hot damn, some people are just fucking uber

anyone else feel like this?

i can't explain really....it's not jealousy, it's not remorse......it's a
"what if" kind of musing that is somewhat deflating

i am still proud of what i have done - more proud of that than 'deflated' by
what i could have done

from now on, i'm using a sig...
