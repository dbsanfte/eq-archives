Yup, exactly.

The Idol's sole purpose in life is to allow access to people who can
kill Statue, but can't kill AoW. Previously, killing Stat meant that AoW
popped for 1 hour after Stat died, then despawned for a week (until Stat
respawned). So killing Stat without the force to do AoW after, was
essentially destroyed all that AoW loot. So, uberguilds had to camp and
kill Stat, even if the loot was going to twinks or rotting, because he
was their ticket to AoW.

 Now the Idol has been put in to separate the two. When you kill Stat,
the Idol spawns and doesn't despawn. Idol drops no loot at all, and if
unslowed, provides a good approximation of AoW damage output. Basically,
no-one should have any reason to spawn AoW without a realistic chance of
killing him.
