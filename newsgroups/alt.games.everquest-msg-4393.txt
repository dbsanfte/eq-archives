>Define contribution please.

Here's the ideal.  Obviously the actual differs wuite a bit.

For Veterans:
1.  Provide helpful advice given when it's asked for.
2.  Interesting tidbits learned from within game during your own play
time
3.  Requests for strategies for taking down opponents you have never
faced before or are seemingly underpowered against.
4.  In game lore.
5.  Legitimate complaints about issues the game designers are unaware
of, or are aware of but dont agree with you on.
6.  Tales of victories or defeat within game.
7.  Sarcasm, satire, poetry, songs or other (NON BINARY) artful works
resulting from the addiction know as EQ.

From the newer players:
1.  Solicitations on where to hunt, wht class to play, what gear to
get.
2.  Anything that would be considered a 'FAQ' type question to a new
player
3.  Tales of victory or defeat within game.
4.  Etc 

 Point being that despite not being familiar with the game newbies are
welcome with open arms and there are at least a few players who will
give assistance when asked for politely, in at least passable english,
and without a lot of posturing.  Beggars will be killed and eaten.
Braggarts will be flamed or ignored.  Those who have legitimate
questions will be answered with a smile.

I think I've been pretty consistant in my posts within these
categories, fee free to do a deja search and see how I have progressed
from a clueless newbie to a pretty well cognizant lvl 52 Wizzy.  Hey,
you might even get to read some posts by Alisdair Allen and Sam S, two
guys who REALLY know how to flame someone, not the worthless bait the
FA cronies have been coming up with...
