None of them see invis.   And you should have a second or two inside before
aggro.  (theres enough time for my rogue to get sneak and hide on)..
probably enough time to cast DA, if you really want to.

And really, what works best is just having the whole group invis and zone in
at once.  If you can't take two 500 point harm touches and continue fighting
two level 45'ish mobs, your group has no business being in that zone.
