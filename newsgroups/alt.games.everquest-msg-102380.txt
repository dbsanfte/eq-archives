I think EQ will be the last game that does this.  The newer games are being
designed to *allow* you to spend great big gobs of time on them, but to not
*require* you to do so.  In EQ, if you are usually limited to play sessions
of a couple of hours or so, you quickly run into limits on just how far you
can go.  If you get addicted to the world and story, you end up finding the
time to play more, often at the cost of other things, like your job or your
schoolwork or your real-life relationships.

In the newer MMORPGs, from what I've seen (DAoC) and heard about (AO), it
seems that if you don't want to spend long play sessions, you do not lose
out on doing anything...it just takes longer in real time.  E.g., in DAoC
if you only play two hours a day, you'll take five times as long to reach
any given level as someone who plays 10 hours a day, but the path will be
the same...you just took longer to walk it...you won't find that parts of
it have to be skipped because they required a 10 hour play session to do.

This has two consequences.  I don't think the newer games will build as
strong an online in-game community as EQ did.  Downtime is much less in
newer games (long downtime is one of the reasons EQ needs long playtime
to accomplish things), but with less downtime, less socializing time is
available.  The other consequence is that the newer games will not have
as big an impact on your life outside the game...the combination of not
needing to devote large amounts of time, and less strong communities in
the game, will mean the newer games will fit in better with other parts
of your life.
