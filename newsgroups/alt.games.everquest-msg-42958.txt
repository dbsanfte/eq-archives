Lots more spoiler sites now than there was in beta.  Lots more quests (xp)
and trade skill recipes (pp when you loot ingredients that other will buy
from you) as well.  Plus, of course, you have experience playing the game
and know what to expect.  It doesn't surprise me in the slightest that you
reached level 31 much faster 2.5 years after beta.
