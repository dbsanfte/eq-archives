<<snip some anger>>

First, this was not an attempt to do any dick-waving.  This was the
perception that I see on the server.  I guess The Pantheon is doing
the hard stuff, and not bragging about it, which I applaud.  I did
check out The Pantheon site and was quite suprised to see that you
guys are still so powerful.  I know that you were the big guild when I
was first starting out, but you have pretty much dropped off the radar
screen (except for the odd comment on the innoruuk.com message
boards).
Second, I am certainly not saying that you guys throw unlimited bodies
at the big mobs, but there are guilds that are successful because of
the number of bodies they can get for any given raid.  Not all
powerful guilds are like that, and after reading some of your website,
it appears that you guys do like killing stuff with an
appropriately-sized party.
Third, Method of Madness did originate from a guild split, but it was
not members who were kicked out.  Guilds grow and change, and not
everyone has the same goal.  We are still close to many members of the
previous guild and do NOT tolerate any members speaking badly of them.
It's base and classless.  
Finally, I apologize for daring to assume that The Pantheon is
anything but an Uber-Guild, and I'm sorry to experience my first
negative interaction with anyone from your fine guild.  You guys *are*
known and respected as a guild that DOES NOT engage in just the type
of behavior that you're exhibiting here.  I am going to assume that
this is a one-time explosion and that what you really meant to say was
"The Pantheon is still a very powerful guild, we just don't like to
brag about it.  Since you asked we have killed the following tough
mobs...."
