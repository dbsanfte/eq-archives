I use it if I'm going to be hunting in an area for a while and I don't want to
keep recasting SoW.  I also use it for the Ultravision component (Form of Great
Wolf I believe).  You can use it really anywhere as long as you recognize what
dangers it may cause.  If you are approaching something that you are concerned
might attack wolves just con it from a safe distance and drop wolf form if
needed.  But as others have stated, when hunting in the old world it can be
helpful to keep some types of animals off of you such as cats.  I've been killing
HG's in North Karana without Wolf form and had lions attack me while med kiting.
Not a huge problem but certainly a nuisance that wolf form helps to avoid.

If you are simply traveling through an area and not really hunting, I would
suggest just using SoW and Superior Camo.  I never travel in areas that have
creatures even blue to me without Superior Camo on just to avoid nuisance
attacks.  It may not protect you from everything, but it protects you from most
things.
