I recently asked a similar question and received some very helpful
responses. You can search on the subject "Legends" but just in case your
usenet provider doesn't retain long enough, I've copied in its entirety the
answer that I received from Stevie, a level 60 Sorceror on the Legends
server. She copies parts of my original post, for context:

I play on the Stormhammer server, and have been there since day one.
Basically it's a *very* high-end player server, with the vast majority of
the populus standing at level 60 or above. Getting a group so far below
these levels might prove to be frustrating, though there are a few guilds
starting to spring up that cater for the low to mid-range player, one guild
that comes to mind is Alpha Storm. I have no knowledge of how they fair or
what makes them tick, I'm just giving you some information as to what's
available.

The high-end players are *very* commited to their cause, and most if not all
*Uber* guilds raid and raid hard, and have some very strict criteria for
guilding new player characters. Some of the better known guilds that you
might want to search for are Leviathan, which (IMO) is the best guild on the

server (no, I'm not a member) Vexare, Science of War, Europa too are getting
up there .. and then of course there's Township Rebellion, a guild that many
people dispise for awakening the Sleeper so soon after Stormhammer was
launched. I know many people in all of these guilds and I can't say that
I've meet any that aren't pleasant enough.

Things are very expensive to buy on Stormhammer too, even more so now that
PoP is out. The economy (IMHO)  hasn't settled down yet, and my guess is
that it might take another year for things to steady themselves out.

As for morons, yes, we have those too, *plenty* of them, it always amazes me
the sheer greed that people have when playing a game. KSing, yes, just as on
other servers, but perhaps not as bad. Remember that most things are done
with the guild, so KSing isn't *really* an issue, though it does happen to
those of us that prefer to solo exclusively.

I've probably answered this question in the above paragraphs, but to add to
what I've said already .. A *very* high percentage of low to mid-range
characters are *extremely* heavily twinked, as they're just alts that have
been made to pass the time, or to store loot on.

It's up to you whether you come or not, my honest opinion is that you'd find
it hard at your current level. Shaman really do function *much* better at
the high-end, so I think you'd be fighting a lost cause. Level up on a
server where you can find groups easily, *then* come to Stormhammer would be
my hand-on-heart advice.

As for the *events* that you may have read about, it is my opinion that
these *events* are nothing short of abysmal. The vast majority of this
so-called premier content is PvP stuff. Gnomes fighting Dwarves and so on -
There's nothing that really stands out as being exceptional on Stormhammer.
The server crashes more than *any* other server, we were promised 24/7 GM
service, we had that for a while and now that's gone. The Legends Webpages
have been broken so many times it's a joke, and then of course there's the
cost.

When all is said and done, you might wonder why I stay on such a server - so
I'll answer that question for you. At the end of the day the server isn't
*full* of annoying kids running up to you and standing right in front of
your nose whilst you're trying to fight. These idiot buff-beggars, port
beggars, cash beggars truly were (and are) a royal pain in the backside. It
hated seeing kids shouting childish things in /ooc and in /shout - so, after
enjoying *mostly* mature conversation on Stormhammer, this is my home.

I hope this helps ..

Kind regards ...

Stevie.

(Level 60 Sorcerer) - Stormhammer.
