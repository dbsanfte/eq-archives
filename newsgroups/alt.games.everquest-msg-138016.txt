    Warriors with good gear are good soloists at any level. Pull mob, kill
it with your haste item/solid weapons, bandage to slightly more than half
with the "removed items" trick, go kill the next thing. At higher levels you
have people like some of my guild's tanks: haste self with Eyepatch of
Plunder, apply all other self buffs (including various damage shields from
right-click items), pull, fight with Primal until proc, fight with Truncheon
of Doom until slow procs, pull out real weapons and beat mobs silly, bandage
and Fungi/Heart of Fungus up, repeat. Surprisingly fast. My little warrior
was able, when the mobs were still just dark blue, to keep Dead Side zone
area clear. That's the frog at zone, two at the top of the slippery ramp,
one wanderer, four undeads leading to the river, and five live ones heading
to the waterfall. One frog every two minutes or so, given the respawn time
there. Not a shabby kill rate for "poor soloists"!
