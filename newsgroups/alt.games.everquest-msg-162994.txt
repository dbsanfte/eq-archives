Whoops broke my own rule - apologies :)

You are right, its pointless calling people names, then it really does 
descend into farce. No I kept the thread going for 2 reasons.

I was absolutely amazed that it was in the EULA - although I can now 
understand why it is - although because my chars are so low that reason 
is a little null. That said I don't think I would get the return 
required - heck I may even return to this game in a while, then I would 
be sour lol. Already done it once.

I was even more amazed that people backed the EULA conditions up. 
Probably if they all told you to twiddle your ears whilst you went in 
game you all would do so without question - well its in the EULA :)

I better sign off whilst the going is good :)

Miles
