As a bard, I have located corpses entirely within a wall in the past, which
the person who died went by many times without seeing.   However when they
did /corpse by the wall where the corpse was, it summoned it.  Probably wont
help in your situation, but might be worth a try.  Fairly low level (5?)
bard song, so most bards will be glad to try to help.
