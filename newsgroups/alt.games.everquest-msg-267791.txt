So what? Need For Speed I, II, III, Hot Pursuit, Hot Pursuit II,Porsche 
Unleashed are all completely different games. They don't need each their 
own newsgroups.

Everquest, Everquest II, Lords of Everquest, and Everquest PDA edition 
combined don't generate enough traffic to each require separate 
groups... and they're all on topic for an everquest group... so why 
split them?
