I've noticed that, too. It's perhaps even worse - pick any reasonably
crowded zone, do a /who, and I'd bet dollars to donuts that several
bad names show up - some of them in very high levels.

No doubt GM resources are tight. I'd certainly prefer that they make
helping decent players deal with more serious problems their priority,
but despite that, I do find it somewhat discouraging that even when I
report bad names, the best response I ever hear is from a Guide,
promising to send the request upstream.

It would be nice if senior guides had the power to deal with obvious
name violations immediately, with a log of their actions being
forwarded to the GMs. This would save a LOT of time in the process,
and make Norrath a better place for everyone.
