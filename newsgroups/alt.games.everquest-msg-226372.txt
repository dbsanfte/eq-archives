Fine, heres your chance: How is the contest relevant? Or would you 
rather just make silly innuendos about asses and IQs?

I don't see it. What I do see is SOE tying the EQ2 beta to buying LOE, a 
product most of are entirely disinterested in. The fact that they are 
also providing a contest that lets you duck the tie doesn't mean the tie 
isn't there, it just means that a bunch of contest winners will be 
exempt from the tie.
