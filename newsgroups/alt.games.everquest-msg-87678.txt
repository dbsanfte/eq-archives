Nonsense.

If you're looking solely at XP camps, a shaman and bard are
more than sufficient.   The key to being able to avoid the
dedicated healing (clerics can do other things, but they are
first and foremost healers) of a cleric is the shaman's slow.
With that, their heals become enough.   And, if you can
control the pulls (monk or other FD puller, generically),
you don't need the superb crowd control of the enchanter.
And you don't see many melees asking for C2, either. ;)

Yep, get one guy to fight and three to follow him around to
/cheer him on.  Sounds efficient to me.  ;)

Killing in EQ is done most efficiently via melee damage.  It's
the one thing that doesn't require downtime as long as the
group can keep them on their feet fighting.  The "perfect"
group has a puller who can avoid "training" their own group;
enough crowd control to deal with an unexpected add (or
two); and everyone dealing damage without causing
downtime.

The only four-person group that I can think of that meets
those requirements is monk, bard, warrior, and shaman.
That's three people doing melee damage on most fights
with the best class in the game able to take damage doing
so and one person providing support through damage
avoidance (slow) and damage enhancement (buffs.)

Combine with SoW (for escapes) and Selos (for travel) and
they're pretty good at pretty much any XP camp.  Their
one limitation in day-to-day XP gaining is going to be caused
by there only being four of them, not by the makeup of the
group.
