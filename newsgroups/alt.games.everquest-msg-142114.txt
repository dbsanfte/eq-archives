I wouldn't call druids a 'healer type' class.  Really, druids seem
more like an offensive spell caster.  Really good nukes.  Really good
DoT's.  Some decent debuffs.  Even our defensive spells seem to be
mainly there to help offense (damage shields and the like).

Healing is just something else that druid can do.  IMHO.

To me, Priest is not equal to Healer.

But what the fuck to I know.
