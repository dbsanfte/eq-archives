I stumbled across an Iksar called Trooper Vaurk who asked if I had been sent by
someone to [assist] driving back invaders from Firiona Vie. Naturally I said I
was and he said that he would stand guard where he was and I should seek out and
kill these invaders from around the lake near Fironia Vie and return to him 4 of
their knives. Anyone know anything about this quest? I checked Allakhazam and
there's nothing there about it. Can a lvl 25 Monk do this quest? If so, is the
reward worth it?

Thanks in advance.

Cheers Watchman. :)
