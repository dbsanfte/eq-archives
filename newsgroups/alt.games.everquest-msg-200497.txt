I'm not sure what exactly you mean by silliness Rumble, but I can quite
clearly recall a time when a non-anon L29+ Enchanter in a hunting zone
was rarer than Quillmane.  If that's not out of hand, I'd sure like to
know what is.  And pre-SoL, the only reason Druids and Wizards weren't
quite as universally anonymous was because there were a lot more of
them.
