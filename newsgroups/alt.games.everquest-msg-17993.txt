Gettting mobs to come to you from a distance is a nice feature,
but its hardly the exclusive province of Druids and Shaman.

Every spell casting class can do something annoying at a distance.
Further, Warriors, Rangers, Paladins, Shadowknights, and Rogues
can all wield bows. (you'll find that with a good bow and arrow
combination, its possible to hit things so far away that you can't
see them)

Bards have to wait a few levels, but eventually (while still
quite young) get Bellow, which is a DD song usable at a
distance.

Monks are pretty much the only class that can't "pull" from
quite far away, and even they can use thrown weapons,
unfortunately the range on these things is so short as to
make them no better than a "head start" weapon, rather than
the "sit and pull" tool everyone else has.

=If= its paramont to you to avoid running after mobs, I'd
go for a ranger, who not only can pull from extreme distances,
but who has the best Track skill in the game, and thus always
has his next mob lined up to kill as soon as he's ready, no
wandering around conning stuff and hoping to stumble accross
something viable.
