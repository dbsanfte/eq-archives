Some of the snow cougars are even or even blue. Same with Dire Wolves
and Tundra Kodiaks. The occasional wandering RyGorr scouts tend to be
blue, too (never saw one even as high as white at 29). There's a small
orc villaga to the right coming off the Dragon Bridge you could handle
with a small group, too.

SNow Dervishes and Snow Griffs are the only pain solo. The dervs,
however, will fall with a low 30's group. The griffs...well, run. The
griffs aren't all that common from what I've seen, though.
