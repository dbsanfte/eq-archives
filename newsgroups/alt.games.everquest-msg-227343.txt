: The 12/4/2003 edition of the Boston Globe has a short story about
: pitcher Curt Schilling and his love for playing EQ; one thing the
: story mentions is that his former teammate Doug Glanville, who hit two
: homers off Schilling in a 2001 game, told an ESPN reporter that the
: homers were payback for Schilling's character (which sounds like a
: cleric alt) running off and letting Glanville's dwarf paladin die
: while they were grouped in Butcherblock Mountains!
