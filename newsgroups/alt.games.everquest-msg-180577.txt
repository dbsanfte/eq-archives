This may or may not work for you, but I had a similar issue last night where
it would continue to crash at different points.  Could never stay in game
for even a minute if I made it that far.  The specs are a little different
then yours, but we solved our problem by turning off the sound in the game.
I know it's horrible to play without the attack music, but atelast now I can
play!  Somewhere I heard that the sound also uses RAM and I do have the same
amount (256) as you so you may want to atleast try that.  Hope you get it
fixed!!
