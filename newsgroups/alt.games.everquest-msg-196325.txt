    Earth is about the best elemental plane to group up in. Full groups
there usually can pull in one AA per 50 minutes. Fire doesn't have XP like
that. Fire does have some nice solo spots for casters, though. Water isn't
so hot, and Air might as well be raid-only.

    The ones that don't are the ones that eventually drown. Count on it.

    As you progress deeper into the zone, you'll find that DMF can cause
significant graphics lag for the entire raid. We limit DMF to certain people
who require it to do their jobs - everyone else can get a Waterstone, or can
get told to go buy a &^%&%# Fishbone Earring.

    Have someone who is going to loot it /assist off you, get beside the
wall, then do a /loot. That should do it.

    You have no idea. If a mob that summons is pushed into a wall in Water,
when it summons someone they'll get ported to zone-in.

    Grioihin, isn't it? We call him Grioioioioioio, or just Wise. Wise,
Mighty, Enlightened, Hydro.

    Which just got buffed up in the last patch.

    And that's one thing that got buffed up. The range is now too far to
avoid it.

    Air is a miserable place. Huddling at zone-in is a good idea.

    Clearing any island of things spawns a miniboss of some sort on that
island. On later islands, when you kill the miniboss, you spawn an elemental
mold dropper. The mold droppers pop in the castles you're about to describe.
When you get tired of the loot off the guys that pop on the first island,
you can do what we do. Have a bard fire up Selo's and DA song (and resists
for the silly blind spell they cast), and start training the suits in a
circle on the island. Have the raid run around one wall and get to the
tunnel while the bard trains. When everyone is through and likely fighting
the wanderers in the tunnel beyond, bard Escapes and joins raid. Much faster
than clearing one side and moving the raid that way.

    If it's a recluse, it has to be offtanked. They hit for a ton and proc a
spin stun. The spin stun is a massive pain, as tanks that engage them are
usually stunned before they can build significant aggro. Which means as soon
as you cast that first heal.... There's an entire island of these things. It
used to be a lot worse than it is now because of pathing. You will learn to
hate that island with a passion. Start padding that level with buffer XP
now.

    Hmm. That drops off a named turkey-looking mob (the type other people
call "bees") that has an annoying AoE. He's near zone too, so maybe you got
them switched?

    Here's a helpful hint: if you have the DPS to do this, pull stuff to
outside the castle. We haven't gone inside one as a raid since we first did
it and, guess what, got adds.

    Queen Silandria. Nice mask, good mob to get people up to par with as she
always seems to be up. Well, it - don't know that you can call an asparagus
with wings "she".

    That's the spirit. If you ain't dyin', you ain't tryin'!

    Good luck!
