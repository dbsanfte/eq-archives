I'll disagree with you here. I think that even if I start playing with
the intent of becoming a Jedi, there will be plenty of other aspects
to the game to keep me entertained regardless. I can't imagine being
so obsessed with becoming a Jedi that I ignore the rest of the game.
Nor can I imagine being so disappointed or frustrated by this that I
stop playing.

I gotta tell ya though, those who must become a Jedi to not get mad
and quit are those I won't miss in the first place.

With this I do agree. They say that it won't be possible though...
