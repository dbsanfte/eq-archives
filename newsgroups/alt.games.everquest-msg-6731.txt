SW corner of the zone.   The "Ledge" is by the Frontier Mountains zone.

And I wouldn't really recommend it nearly as much as this person did.  You
won't have much to offer a group until a few levels into 30.  Around 33 you
should be getting a good amount of blues.   Also, the loot in Overthere
completely sucks.   The only thing dropping plat at all was the chickens, and
unlike Frontier Mountains, there were no big selling loot items that can drop.
One of the poorest zones I've ever fought in.

Cazic Thule is nice, however, like most dungeons these days, its pretty much
BYOG.  (Bring Your Own Group.)

Mistmoore is the same way.
