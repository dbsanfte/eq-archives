I see it as folks who don't want to realize the game is boring. Its
not addicting.  Its content is long drawn out quests and group
activity. I've seen posts in various places where people state they
play because of the chat while they wait for certain monsters to
spawn. Of course, they could just chat on irc and not game at all.

Blaming a game for someone one's activities is absurd. I've met a
few people over the years who have addictive personalities. It
doesn't matter what it might be, they get caught up in something.
Card games, televised sports, barbeque, counting their coin change
over and over. What is sad are those who think if they don't go to
their local bar/pub and watch their fave sport team on telly, the
team will lose the game.
