It's interesting to look at the numbers for various games.  When EQ came
out, UO was at about 125k subscribers.  Since then, UO has grown to 250k and
EQ has grown to 450k.

When AC came out, UO was a bit below 150k, and EQ a bit above 150k.  AO has
since grown to about 100k and is flat there.

When AO came out, UO was at about 230k, EQ was at 400k, and AC at 100k.  AO
quickly grew to about 50k and stabilized there.

When DAoC came out, EQ was just over 400k, and UO, AC, and AO were pretty
much at their current values.  DAoC grew to about 220k.

When SWG came out, it quickly shot to about 275k, and is probably still
going up (although the way they are botching things could hurt...you think
it got bad in EQ after some expansions?  SWG has scheduled downtime of an
hour a day every day, which rumour says is for database maintenance to try
to prevent everything from falling apart--they *massively* botched their
database planning, and they have such lovely glitches as having to tell
people not to delete characters, because it sometimes will delete the wrong
character (and since it is one character per server, if you change you mind
about what to play but want to stay on the same server, you have to delete)
(and yes, that means that by "delete the wrong" character that means "delete
a character of yours on a different server")), at no reduction in the EQ,
AC, AO, or DAoC numbers.

So, it looks like indeed a successful new game manages to bring in a lot of
new players, rather than take from existing games.  There is some taking,
but the majority seems to be new.

So, if you are doing a new game, why go head to head against UO, EQ,
DAoC, or SWG?  All four of those are very successful, so everyone has heard
of them, and more importantly, all your potential customers will probably
know someone ALREADY PLAYING whichever one you are going head to head
against, and will have a tendency to go with that game to play with their
friends.

AC didn't do well if you look at it as going one on one with EQ...starting
from its launch it gained 100k subscribers while EQ gained 300k.  On the
other hand, DAoC did pretty well...it gained 220k while EQ gained about 40k.

Yeah...one thing you can say about EQ, DAoC, UO, and AC (and probably AO
after the horrible early bugs were fixed) is that once they got players,
those players could get "into" the world, and develop an attachment to their
characters.  The two of those I've played a fair amount (EQ and DAoC) both
become kind of "real".  There are times where I've had vague memories of
some interesting place that I'd like to see again, and thought it was
perhaps a park or someplace my family went on vacation when I was a kid or
something...and then realized it was someplace from EQ or DAoC.

That's one of the reasons none of these games have really been hurt by later
games.
