Lol.   I play 2 characters because
a) my monk needs more AA levels
b) my cleric needs level 60 (58 atm)

Sure controlling them both isnt soloing, the exp I lose from grouping is
offset by the extra exp of zero downtime/ability to pull several at once.

I can solo if needs be (and have done), fight, fight, mend, fight, bandage,
fight, bandage, fight, mend, or I can run my cleric too and fight fight
fight fight fight fight fight....

I only had 2 computers long after I made 60, I did all the hard work myself

Why anti-social though?  Theres a rogue who I play with daily (hes in
canada, im in the UK, so theres a gap of several hours when just one of us
is on), another rogue who joins us on occasion, a few other select friends
who are welcome to join us.   I raid every single day, so I still group with
many different people.. I just chose to make the most of my very limited
non-raiding time
