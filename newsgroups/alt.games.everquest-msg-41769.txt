I didn't catch the thread and I don't feel like reading it, but just for
your edification, in case you misunderstood the emoticon, :p is usually
connoted as some degree of disgust.  The :P means sticking one's tongue out
at someone.  They don't mean the same thing, in case you thought they did.
The emoticon :/ usually connotes confused sadness or embarassment, depending
on context.
