I'm very sceptical of your statement here.  How on earth would you
even know that someone had wiped the aggro list secretly?  Lets
see, I sit here taunting a mob, we break mez, and it comes right for
me.  Damn, that cleric wiped the aggro list so it focused on the guy
who, er, was trying to get it to focus on him.  Hmm.

Now lets try it with a cleric who does -not- atone.  Sit here trying
to build aggro.  Break mez.  Sometimes it goes for me, damn I'm
good at taunting... sometimes it goes for the cleric.  Sure am glad
that bastiche didn't atone, why now I alone am to blame for my
failure to taunt!

OK, that aside, yes, I do tell people I'm atoning, because I want
to make sure the shaman/druid/chanter/mage et al are not going
to slap an aggro spell on after I do, and that the Sponge does
taunt at least once before we break mez.  It is blatently obvious
when tanks are taunting a mezed mob, they stand around it
very close not doing anything... this isn't something I'm going to
miss.   However, I and the chanter have been working hard
to get way up on that hate list while saving your butt, for 60 mana
I can wipe that slate clean so you get a nice fresh mob willing
to listen to your idea as to who it should hit.  Why would you
-not- want that?

Indeed, more often than not my plan is to not worry about actively working

on crowd control duty.  On the other hand, find yourself in a group with
a single tank, and no, I don't want him leaving the main mob and
coming over to try and save my butt... I'm not a chanter, I've got
the AC and HP to stand a beating long enough to get things under
control, and the tools to do so.  If I atone after I get the thing
rooted (even if it took a couple resists before that happened) then
you do -not- have to work harder to taunt it off me later... because
I wiped that hate.  Thats what atone does, and why you do it.

Here again, stack tash, mez, slow, and fail to mem blur, and you have
noone but yourself to blame if it comes to eat you the second mez
wears off.  How simple would it be to just say you were sorry you
cast all those mean spells?  All's forgotten, hmmm, I'd better deal
with this bully who's saying mean things about my mother!

Taunt functions by putting you up at the top of the current hate
list... but now any action by the cleric (say, healing you) can put
him right back up on top.  Atone does pretty much the same thing,
it lowers the hate list back down to ground level.  Cleric is just
as much in danger of getting aggro back as he was before.  Whats
the difference, then?  Well, not much once the mob is engaged...
but when the tanks are all clustered around the current victim,
noone is taunting the mezed (or rooted...) adds.  If the fight goes
long and mez (or whatever) breaks, Atoned mobs are going to
go for the closest target, while ones that haven't been atoned are
going to have to pick between the cleric and chanter... neither of
which do we really want.

Would you suggest that the person who wants to be hit -not- taunt?
If not, then why would you suggest that the people who don't
want to be hit not anti-taunt by wiping the hate list?

Now I'll be the first to admit that I don't cast this spell regularly,
ordinarily there is no need for it, normal aggro control measures
are adequate to the job.  But look again at the title of the thread,
we are talking about a cleric in a situation where aggro control
-is- a problem.  Are his tanks brickheads who think nothing
of breaking mez with an arrow without taunting first?  Is he in
a group short on tanks, or (heck, at lower levels this is viable)
using non-taunting melee as "tanks"?  Maybe his group composition
is very tank light, and fights are going long.  Maybe the mobs
are mean enough that the "a couple swings" worth of aggro on
his chanter is going to mean a dead chanter.  (this especially
happens when you've had to go with a relatively low level
chanter to fill out the group... soft target)
