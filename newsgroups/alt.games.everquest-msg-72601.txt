Well I'm not putting much in, but plan to put it into run speed.  Six
times.
Realistically, the ability to outrun mobs -inside- has got to be the best

of that list.  I -could- get 12 wisdom out of it or something... but 12
wisdom is just a little equipment.  There is nothing else in the game
that will make me faster indoors (except for zoning out, getting sow/et
al,
and zoning back in)

As a bard, I'd still say run speed.  Just as with SOW, yes, it seems
silly
for a bard... but if you don't  have to twist selos thats one more slot
open for -useful- songs.  When you want to hit the afterburners, great,
but now you'll never run slower than the mobs you pull... and you'll
have it indoors.

Course they'll probably nerf the indoors part soon.
