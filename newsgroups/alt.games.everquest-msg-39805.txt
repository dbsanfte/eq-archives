Depends on:
How much you can get from selling the gear
What the other players stats are
How much time you plan to invest

With int/wis close to 200 and char over 105, it takes around 1K to hit 175
blacksmithing.  At that point you can attempt Fine Plate but the harder
pieces (Gaunts, Cloaks, BPs) are still going to be rather hard, maybe 3-4
tries each.

Fineplate is expensive to make.  With no failures its around 650-700pp to
make a full suit.  At 175 skill you can expect to pay twice that, 1300-1400
to make a suit.  I'd imagine you could buy a suit for less then that (136
AC, so the second hand market would sell Fineplate for 1300 a suit)

If you plan on taking smithing further, yes it could be worth it.  If you
can sell you current gear for 2500+ then you'd have the funds to do it.  If
your stats are lower, expect the cost to be higher.
