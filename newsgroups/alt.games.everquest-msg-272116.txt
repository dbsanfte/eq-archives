I'm getting very addicted to crafting in this game, so much so that I havent 
even left Qeynos for a week.

So far I have two characters, my main guy (lvl 18/pred - lvl 16/Craftsmen) 
and a alt (lvl 13 warrior - lvl 16/Outfitter)

I am getting close to choosing my main crafting choice for both guys but i'm 
not sure what to go for. I dont like playing the warrior at all so he's 
going to be staying at his current level. I love my predator/ranger though, 
so I want a class that is useful to him.

I was thinking along the lines of:

Woodworker
Tailor
Armourer or Weaponsmith (Going to start a new alt for this)

Would these three compliment each other? The obvious skill I am missing from 
the above is alchemy for all the resins etc. I'm thinking however that these 
should be available in the wholesalers in the future. Wayfarers already has 
tier 2 resins so tier 3 shouldnt be that far off.

My plan is to be able to kit out my pred/ranger with all the items he is 
going to need in terms of armour/bows/arrows/shields/weapons. This only 
leaves magic items to purchase.

I know you should trade with other players but I dont have the time to beg 
for items, especially with the lvl20+ crafting recipes that need 3-4 
combinations from different classes.

Anyone else planning something like this?
