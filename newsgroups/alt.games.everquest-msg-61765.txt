It is more important for some classes than others. Some classes have only a
small contingent of spells that they use...rangers, paladins,
clerics...none of them have to do very much spell swapping. Bards, Shamans,
Enchanters (if they are any good) are CONSTANTLY popping songs/spells in
and out of memory to best serve the need of the group.

I can't fathom how people played up to level 50 without the ability to
organize the spellbook AT ALL...I started playing late enough to avoid that
nightmare (my main, who I then discarded when I changed servers a few
months later) was only level 18 or so, and so the number of spells was
pretty low, and I had planned ahead so that the spells I would quickly
replace weren't in the front of the book.
