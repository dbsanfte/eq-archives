I haven't uploaded any pics in a long long while.. lemme see what I can dig
up tho on my webspace....

K this one made me laugh, I've got an upload section for guildie pictures
and one sent this - our first ever attempt on the AoW (with 2 clerics...
hehehe).  If you don't like mildly bad language, then don't click it.

The best place to see cool screen shots is on the various bigger guilds
websites imo.
