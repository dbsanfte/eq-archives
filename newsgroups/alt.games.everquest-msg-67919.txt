Luclin seems to be built solidly on the Kunark model, and the area
around Shar Val is thus far the beast newbie area in the game in
my opinion.  Like Cabalis, you have a zone full of quests (more quests
than I ever saw in Cab, actually, by a factor of ten) and ranging from
1 to 30 right outside.  If you are heavily twinked, then the quests will
be meaningless to you, but if you are untwinked or lightly twinked (I
gave myself a small pile of cash to work with) they are great bonuses
for hunting and collecting the loot drops.  Shadeweaver is
the Lake of Ill Omen of the moon, with wide range hunting, tight
crowded camp hunting, tunnel hunting... there are guards to run to
at low levels, while without SOW its too far by a long shot for higher
levels to get to.

Shadeweaver has a couple vendors, trainers for all the Vah Shir classes,
and a bank; pretty much unheardof in an outdoor hunting zone.

The moon has a wealth  of zones I haven't explored, but I know
guildmates in the 50s are happily doing a number of zones, and there
seems to be a range all the way from 1 to 60 up there, and in a wide
variety of flavors.  Warning, there -is- a steep learning curve at
play up there, noone know zones or creatures well yet, and its easy
to get in over your head if you get cocky...

Issues with the expansion center, to me, exclusively around the fact
that it initially ran like crap.  The technical problems are gradually
fading, leaving quite a gem chipped out of the rough that was the
initial release.
