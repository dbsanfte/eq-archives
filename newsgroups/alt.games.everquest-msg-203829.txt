When you dye and before you hit the button, you'll see your armor piece in
the tint chosen. Nice feature.

Also, I had some yellow Wu's leggings. When I applied a light blue the
leggins turned a cool green. Check the color of the piece in the dye window
and experiment. Most are blank to begin with, but some (purchased in bazaar
or made) already have a dye applied.

Note: the blank (white) dye is clear. Before learning about the preview
feature, I spent 80 pp trying to dye my helmet white!
