And perhaps you should look at my headers or at least glance at my
sig. I haven't used Mindspring/Earthlink for over 6 months... Either
way, though, I don't see where I am violating either of those rules.
This is an on-topic discussion - it is about an Everquest account in
an Everquest newsgroup. It's not harassment, either, since we are both
carrying on a discussion in a public forum, and neither has made any
indication of feeling threatened by it emotionally of physically. You
haven't requested that I stop, even. You're encouraging continued
discussion, in fact.

You, however, have clearly violated "2m" by posting a commercial
article (selling of the account) and violating the newsgroups
"community standards".

Next?
