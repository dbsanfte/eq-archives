Just cos its blue doesn't mean you can kill it. I exp in Plane of Valor, A
Valorian Guard cons blue to me at 65 because he is lvl 64, Quad hits at
580+. My charmed pet is as hard mind and kills it but see my point, just cos
its blue doesn't mean you can kill it, heck just cos its green doesn't mean
it isn't gonna wipe the floor with you.
