Ah, this explains the nearly instant rejection of stuff that wasn't in
a local dictionary, yet a long delay before accepting the name that
was actually alllowed.  It's hard to think of something that's
unused _and_ also easy to type (eliminating good Finnish names for my
dwarf).

What exactly does the "fade-to" part of the window settings do?  I
experimented with it, but couldn't quite figure it out.

So you're constantly moving between keyboard to type and arrows to
move?  Now if they made keyboards with arrows and numberpad on the
left...  I'm a touch typist, and I like to turn the lights down when
playing games, so moving my hands while playing doesn't work well.
