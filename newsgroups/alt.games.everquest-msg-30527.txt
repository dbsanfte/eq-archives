You might find that a lot of these players are on twinks (as seems to
be the standard these days). In the highend game anything that cons
yellow to a group of 55+ can present serious issues. It's a hard habit
to break.

And also. Blues are safe. Blues present little REAL challenge to a
balanced group, and thus safe easy XP. You can get more xp killing 2
low blues (easy) than killing ONE red. In a dungeon situation, where
the camp is a new one and/or the spawn is poorly broken that yellow or
red can tax the group to the point where you ALL die.

Safety in numbers. Stick to boring blues. If the group is feeling
adventurous, give it a shot. But don't judge them because they have
different goals to you and turn you down.

/em remembers getting massacred by a craig at 34 (cleric) when he was
SURE the group could take it.
