Howdy...wow, a thread that I don't recall being discussed before ;)
/sarcasm off

Leadership.  Similar game goals.  Friends, or folks with similar ideals so
we can become friends.  Skilled players.

I don't have enough hands to count the number of guilds that have
sunk/merged/disintigrated because of poor top-down leadership (see
above)...and that's just on my server. Even if I were unguilded, the *last*
place I would look for a guild would be in /ooc or /shout.  And if skills
are lacking, online friends make for an infinitely better guild.  I know it
sounds trite, but it's true: "if you build it they will come."

> 3.  What do you feel is a guilds key to success?  (ie. member base [number
> of])

Leadership...and more leadership.  Being able to manage people.  Lead raids,
keep folks active, keep an open mind and having a ton of free time to do all
that.  The leader's ability to *delegate* tasks during a raid/event because,
you can't do it all and those you delegate to should have your trust and a
ton of free time as well.  Keeping a clear head during the rough times.
Putting the health and well being of the guild above all else, even if a few
get pissed off and the guild leader seems like the bad guy to them.  And get
used to being the bad guy <G>.

Having friends in your guild who have fun while online together should be
your goal.  If more friends join then that's fine.  Otherwise, more
members=more headaches.

> 4.  What type of services should a guild offer you the member?

Remain active, host events, remain open to member ideas/suggestions.  If the
members want to raid, then schedule and do that.  If the members want to
chat/roleplay/work on trade skills, then do that, etc.

> 5.  What features should the guild offer on their website?

A decently fast site, with a discussion board, member list, and outline of
the guild's rules and goals.

<snip>

I don't envy any guild leader's task, but it can be very rewarding if you
work at it.  I wish you luck.
