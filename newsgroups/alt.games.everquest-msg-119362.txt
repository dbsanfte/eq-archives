   Well, I'm not a higher level player, but what the heck, I'll chime in anyways. 
Lenny's main on Drinal, Lennaman, (yeah, I know, real creative of him) is a troll
warrior.  Without a doubt, his favorite character to play (now we have to refer to
Lenny Troll, or Lenny Ogre when we talk about his characters).  Lenny Troll was
originally created to teach Tealeef the Troll language.  He wanted to learn Elf from
her, so he could wander around as level 1 troll, speaking elf, and messing with
people's minds (my husband is fun like that).  Sooo... yes, he dumped all of his
starting bonus points into intelligence.  I think that most people familar with the
game would agree that this is not the best use of those points for a Troll warrior.
   Didn't affect the fun he had one bit.  And at level 25 (yes, I know, still a
lowbie) the waste of those points hasn't been an issue at all.

Annie <--- Helped him place is points with Lenny Ogre, however.

-- 
My main on Firiona Vie:

Traveling with husband Lenny, an Ogre Warrior,
Members of the Council of Mithril Dreams.
Teapray  -- High Elf Cleric, 15, slaughtering orcs to help Lenny's faction.

Several others played on Drinal, highest is a level 30 Ranger.
