The needlites are the preferred camp, level 24ish, they hit light and FAST,
max hit for 23, but the speed they attack with makes it seem like they chain
flurry (don't worry, they don't).

Any DS at all owns them (especially my 24 point one =p); which is why
Banshee Aura was mentioned.

Mutants aren't really that great for exp, they hit too hard (had to heal
every other fight while PLing a 32 rogue there), but there's a few of the
named ones that drop loot that doesn't suck.
