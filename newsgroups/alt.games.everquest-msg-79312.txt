Oh yeah, and lizard mystics in Feeroott and Rathe Mountains drops a totem
worth a few CHA.  Never used it, I started playing my enchanter before
Kunark came out so there were plenty of people killing inner-Oggok guards
and letting the Crude Steins rot.

BTW, if you go hunting the guards, don't count on Mem Blur or any of their
upgrades to keep you from taking faction hits (something I really try to
avoid...with a druid handy the Moggok quest is a money-maker).  The mem blur
line, well, SUCKS BIG HAIRY DONKEY BALLS. <ahem>  Sorry.  Last night I
attacked an indiff critter, mezzed it, and cast the level 49 version 5 times
on it...and it still didn't forget me.  Meanwhile, about 3 pulls after that
I mezzed an overpull of indiffs, and when the mez wore off it wandered back
to it's spawn point.  I always use Mez and hope for the best...it seems to
have a decent chance of blurring.

Err my point is, get some friends to do the killing while you buff 'em
before and after the fight.
