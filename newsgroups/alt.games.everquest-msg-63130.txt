Once again I was working the Lord Bergurgle spawn with
a druid and friends, and eventually they all had to leave.
Yes, I wish I'd done it in my 40s when the camp was
decent exp... but hindsight is 20/20, and I'd sworn I'd
never bother with my epic as I despise long boring camps.

At any rate, I'd already tried soloing the spawn and knew
that I couldn't do it, the DW goblin that spawns as a cleric
has a decent enough heal that I can't keep up with him using
reckoning, and enough HP that chain stunning him
into submission runs me out of mana before he runs out
of red bar.  Thats a long swim to zone with him beating on
your butt and getting off a fair number of Wraths, too.

Since I've been playing around with the UHOF, though,
I had an epipheny; tried it out and it actually worked great.

Stun pull the PH and run all the way out the tunnel and up onto
land, where my TBoots give me a movement speed edge...200
swim is not enough to outdistance a DW Goblin underwater.
Stun again, with my back to him, and then run across the island
till the spell icons come back up.  Now cast UHOF while turning
to face the goblin... facing him increases the odds of channeling
thru if he manages to get to me before the spell casts.  Get in his
face (if he's not already there) and start chain stunning, with
brief pauses to step forward to keep in his melee range despite
knockback, ideally rotating him so the hammer is hitting from
behind to prevent ripostes.

Instead of OOM and a goblin still sporting 2 bubs of health
(the result of my all stun all the time approach) I have a dead
goblin and 2 blue mana left!  I have 28 minutes till the next
spawn, so mana efficiency isn't the issue anyway, as long as
I have enough, thats enough.  The one time my hammer did
get killed, I had enough to repeat the stun-run-stun-summon
trick again, still ended fight with part of a blue mana bub left
over.

When Lord B popped, I called in a ranger friend to help,
pulled up onto the island... and no ranger!  Turns out she was
on the wrong island entirely.  By the time she managed
to figure out what was wrong and swim over to me, my
pet and I had the Lord down to a quarter health, and still
plenty of mana to finish the job.  Of course she put one
arrow into the stationary target and dropped it where
it stood...
