If you don't have Kunark, you should get it.

If you do have Kunark, you should hunt Kurn's Tower.  Actually, 
any mention of this place in relation to necros in their teens 
should be written thus:

         KURN'S TOWER!

Imagine several hundred fast skeleton spawns, each dropping 4 sp 
to 2 pp each.  You'll leave at level 18 or 19 with 3 or 4 
backpacksful of bone chips too.  My necro is now 23 and STILL has 
bone chips left over from Kurn's.  Your only drawback is that 
you'll need to make an Iksar mule to buy food and drink and bank 
out your copper, silver and gold with as you will be KOS in 
Cabilis.

(I am not sure if Gnome Necromancers need to take the evil boat 
to Overthere or the good boat to Firiona Vie... you should find 
out about this.)
