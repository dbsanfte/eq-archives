I am still having problems with freezes when I get on EQ.  As part of my
futile efforts, I went through my EQ files and found one entitled dgb.txt
which gave an 11 page list of everything my computer apparently did in
loading up EQ.  Now, I noticed in the list that it said it found glide3x.dll
but no devices.  Well, I have geforce 2 ultra and I saw no indication that
it looked for that card or the drivers or dll files for it.  Could that be
the reason why I keep freezing up?  Also, when I go to options page in start
up, there is no indication that it has found or is using the geforce card.
Any suggestions or insight?

Thanks,
Bob
