Well...Quest's by their nature involves -going- somewhere and doing 
something specific upon a arrival. (Be it -retrieve- or -kill- or -kill 
then retrieve- or -deliver-...)

If upon arriving at the destination the npc you are going 
deliver/kill/or kill and retreive from spawns then the quest won't take 
you very long to complete.

Sure, but it shouldn't be a choice where the most rewarding path is the 
least challenging.
