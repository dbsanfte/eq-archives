www.pricewatch.com.  The more expensive it is (per brand of
processor...Geforce & Radeon come immediately to mind) the better/faster the
card.

It's my understanding that the ATI Radeons give better video quality but
take some amount of performance hit, compared to GeForce.  I get the
impression that if you loved the picture quality of your Voodoo in EQ, go
for the Radeon.
