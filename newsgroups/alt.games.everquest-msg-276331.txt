This, I'm sure, is exactly the case. Heh, I was the one who people
labeled a "VAK" here back in the day. Mainly because I'd snap at the
bitchers. Never once did I say that the game was flawless, my problem
was with people ballooning it into an overblown whinefest. ...'course,
similarly, I'm a "fanboi" over on the WoW forums. :p 

Yeah, they're having problems. I in no way deny that. I'm just sick of
people exaggerating them, slinging mud, threatening lawsuits, and all
that shit. I mean, Jesus H Christ, they offer free time when it gets
exceptionally bad and people throw it in their face saying it's not
enough. Most of the time, it's only a few servers down and there are
plenty of others they could play an alt on. The service -IS-
available, idiot whiners are just too stubborn to play anywhere but
their main server.

Like I said in a previous post, they're giving 5 days to everyone with
characters on, like, 20 of the servers because they're bringing them
down for 24 hours. That's 5x the amount of this maintenance time in
free time. And those people are free to play all they want on other
servers and still get the free time. The whining, thus, seems pretty
childish, and I'm not afraid to tell people that. If that makes me a
fanboi, then a fanboi I am. Fact is, -MOST- of the servers are
actually pretty stable and have no queue lines. Just a problem few
that people insist on sticking to.
