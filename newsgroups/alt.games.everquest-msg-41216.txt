And, you do realize that those people dancing in the street are not the
entire population?  You do realize that there are many of them that are just
as horrified at what happened?  You do realize that there are many of them
that are horrified at what is happening around them every day?  Yes, there
are those among them that fully support what happened, and what is happening
every day.  There are also many among them who wish for nothing more than
peace, and a chance at living a normal life.  And, just in case it makes any
difference here, I am a proud american citizen, I do not fully support
everything our government has done, is doing, or will do, I did not vote for
the current president, or for that matter most of the others who are in our
government at the moment.  I also lived in Israel for 6 years, I am a
nonpracticing jew, and I do have somewhat of an idea what it is like living
there, and how arabs in general are viewed.  One telling thing is that the
expression used to say that something was done wrong or poorly, is to call
it "an Arab job".  There is a lot of acrimony on both sides, there is a lot
of justified hatred on both sides.  We here in the US fully support Israel,
this makes us the enemy of Israel's enemies.  I do not, in any way, think
that this justifies terrorism.  I don't think that there is anything at all
that can justify terrorism.
