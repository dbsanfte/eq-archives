When I worked on cars I found that the more expensive the make/model
the more blood I would spill from dinged knuckles and sharp edges. The
repairs always seemed to go smoother after I opened a vein. I chalked
it up to the automotive gods demanding sacrifice. 

I think the same law applies to raids in EQ.....A raid just isn't a
raid until a ranger "gates" :-) 

"Every time a raid mob swings, a Ranger loots his things."
