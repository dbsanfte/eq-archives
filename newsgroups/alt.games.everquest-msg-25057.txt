Almost, but there is a big difference between a high-level guild and
an uberguild.  The differences vary depending on who you're talking
to, but almost everyone can agree that not all high-level guilds are
uber.

I really feel for ya there.  I went through the same thing, and I
finally came to the realization that I had to move on.  Of course my
guild was small enough that it was obvious that I wasn't going to be
able to turn it into a raiding guild.

OK, then don't call it powerleveling.  I'm sure that you have a number
of folks in your guild who you love hunting with, who are slowly
falling back in levels.  You could start hunting with them more and
more, and since experience is divided up based on level (not level
squared or cubed or something) they will catch up with you eventually.
Unless you are at least 50% higher than them in level, you can group
successfully (well, success I guess depends on how good and/or lucky
you are).

This is the really tough part.  How to create a reputation.  From what
I've seen of your postings here, you guys raid as much or more than
almost any other mid-level guild I've known.  I think I remember that
you don't have a server site where you can brag to your peers, which
is rather limiting.  (Innoruuk isn't perfect, but www.innoruuk.com
works pretty well for dispute resolution, general annoucements, and
booking of popular raid spots.)  Maybe push to have all-hands guild
events at least one day a week in a rather popular zone.  Move the
whole guild to Upper Guk (maybe Lower Guk for the higher levels).
Take a field trip to Lake of Ill Omen.  Go clear out Befallen and then
do a conga line back through EC showing off your new loot.  Hell, it
probably won't do much, but you'll have fun at least, and know that
you tried.

I haven't seen them, but from the uberguild requirements I've seen, I
can imagine.  I expect that the requirements are actually not too
outlandish, it's the attitude that scares me.  Of course my guild's
requirements
(http://www.mom.powerwebpage.com/site/main_9.cfm?content_id=4949) show
a bit of attitude also, especially rule 2.4, but that's just our
guildleader making sure that we don't get any whiners.  He is the
Red-headed Bastard, so I expect no less.   We're not The Pantheon yet,
or even Legions of Darkness, but we get by.  It is still a game to us,
Red-Headed Bastard notwithstanding.
