Do you need to be informed of EVERY game bug?  Permanent or temporary?  Or,
just the bugs that effect You?

Probably why your /petition wasnt answered in 30 minutes.  Other players
were breaking the recomendation NOT to give guides a direct tell....as it
simply overloads them and backs up other petitions.
Now, what makes you special?

Who says they didnt?  If I was given a tell by a players, as a guide, when
it is posted all over...NOT to give guides a direct tell, well, I would play
stupid as well....or add you to an ignore list....depending on mood.

Well, again....I am sure someone at verant is reading this.   I hope they
send you a daily message, whenever you log on, of the issues that *might*
effect ***you***.....
As for THINKING about it.....well, did it ever dawn on you how complicated
the EQ game is?  In regards to Code, and computers?  Every server has about
20 'helper' computers.  Tracking down the bug that can effect the boats can
be a huge undertaking.  It might be something as weird as the boats crash
when someone goes on with a bow equipped.  Poor example, but, you get the
idea.
There are also a LOT of bugs in the game.   Suck up and deal.  Quit whining
when one effects you personally.  Overall, the game runs smooth.  Shit
happens.  Yeah, you pay to play.  Maybe think before you whine.  :)
