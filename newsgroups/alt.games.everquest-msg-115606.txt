It's certainly not the druid's fault that the raid leader apparently 
didn't invite enough druids and wizards... Next Grex'll tell us it'd be 
"poor raid etiquette" for the one chanter on a 6-group raid to fail to 
mez the right 19 mobs of a 20 mob pull...

My bestest druid friend, the one time we raided vox, did in fact change 
her bind point, port everyone there, and port everyone back.  But that's 
why she's my bestest druid friend.


It was a pickup raid.  We got -so- wiped.  But it was fun.
