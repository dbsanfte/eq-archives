Interesting.  

I felt exactly the opposite.  Must be another one of those "image of
the beholder kinda fings".  Not trying to say your opinion is wrong,
just that mine is completely opposite.

In EQ you can go to Crushbone and find out that the Orcs are alligning
with the Dark Elves.   You can go to Kael and hear about the struggle
with Dwarves on one side of town, dragons on the other.  You can go to
Crystal Caverns and find a lost tribe of dwarves, Twisted magic in
TOfS, a religious cult in the Kly dungeon.... the list goes on.


In DAoC, it was like... "There's a Roane maiden, never heard of them,
its indifferent, but that guard said I should kill one.  There's a Dew
Sheerie, thought that was a Journey song.... Siabra all over the
place.... look like elves to me.  OMG, it's a Pookah!   RUN!!!"

What the heck is a Pookah?


Basically, I saw unchanging landscape, with 20 or so different NPC
models, with different names, and different levels scattered randomly
over the land.  Never did find any kind of story, logic or plot.
