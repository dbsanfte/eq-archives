Just as a matter of habit, I always keep my top slot in inventory
filled with a bag, which is also mostly always full. (food, drink,
potions, clicky items, whatever) This means that anything you trade,
including other containers, go in lower slots. Unless you have every bag
full this could have prevented the problem you had. I got in this habit
because early in the game there were tons of inventory bugs that would
also cause you to lose items, and it seems a good habit to continue with
for the forseeable future.
