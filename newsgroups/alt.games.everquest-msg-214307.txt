I perosnally think everyone should work on bind wounds,  it's not a hrad
skill too raise, but I do understand why healing classes don't usually work
on it.  My druid has his maxed at 210, it doesn't come in handy too often,
but there has been a few times where I have been DoTed & OOM & Bind Wounds
has saved me from a CR more then once.

As for raising Bind Wounds I just kept DoTing myself, but on my Warroir &
Monk I just dueled a friend and we both worked on Bind Wounds it went up
pretty qiuck.
