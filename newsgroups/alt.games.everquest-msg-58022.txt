It's also possible to do over a movelog. 

Get all your old, unwanted, planar gear out of the bank, equip it and
take a real death. Leave the stuff on the corpse and wait for movelog.
Then, when you're safe on the new server, make a L1 with your old char's
name, and you can loot the corpse. For added fun, get yourself a L56 res
- DING! Welcome to L18!

Highly illegal and probably undoable now, but I laughed when I heard
someone had done it for the first time hehe
