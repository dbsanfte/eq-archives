I tried to play EQ 2 years ago. My machine wasn't up to it
(constant hideous lag). I have since upgraded my machine
(faster cpu, MUCH more memory, new GF2 graphics accelerator),
and would like to try EQ again. I reloaded the software, and
after about 8 tries the EQ Test software was able to download
all the update files. Then I try to run it (both tutorial and
online). No soap. I get a message about the program being
linked to MSS32.dll. I can't find MSS32.dll ANYWHERE. So where
do I find this elusive little DLL? I've tried the Microsoft
OS downloads area, it's not there (at least not by itself).
I've checked my Win98 install disk, it doesn't appear there
either, at least not by that name, and I didn't see any
MSS32.<anything> either. Please help.
