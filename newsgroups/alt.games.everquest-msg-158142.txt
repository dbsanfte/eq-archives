Yes, it appears to be a lot easier.  I don't recall how long it took someone
to get to 60 after Kunark, but it was longer than 4 days.  Verant said that
the higher caps on various skills with Kunark would solve Ranger problems in
the high end game, and FoH didn't believe them, and so PL'ed a Ranger to 60
and maxed all the skills, in order to get real numbers to argue with.
