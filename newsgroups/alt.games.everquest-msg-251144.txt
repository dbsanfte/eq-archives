If you did something that could be done while the PLer was afk, they'd
probably consider it an exploit. I helped PL a friend's enchanter this way.
He summoned pet, I hasted pet (enchanter as well).  I pull several mobs with
ae tash, then AE mem blur, he used his color stun to get some agro, I used
3-4 color stuns to get agro back, and his pet went slice and dice, while I
kept up a constant chain of zerker spells. (component free rune)

For me (wimpy 55 ench)  this stopped being useful by the time he hit 20 or
so.
