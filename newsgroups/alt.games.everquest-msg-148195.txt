Let's not forget what making it too easy and thereby resulting in
everyone running around having all tradeskills maxxed would do to the
economy and the game in general. I also hate having to go through the
tedium. However, becoming a master of any tradeskill with a skill of
250 should be neither cheap nor easy.

Unreal III is just around the corner for those with that kind of
attention span. (Though, admittedly, I will be trying it out too.  :)
