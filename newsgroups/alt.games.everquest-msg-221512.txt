Well, as a Necro, you can solo easilly.  And at level 20, it takes one 
kill in Paludal Caverns of a dark blue mob.  You can literally make up 
the death xp loss faster by just being bound nearby, and going back to 
killing than by getting rezzed and waiting for rez effects to wear off 
and to get your mana back.

That's what I did with my druid, my enchanter, and with my ranger.  They 
all went through the teens and low 20s soloing in Paludal Caverns, far 
away from the bandit crowds.
