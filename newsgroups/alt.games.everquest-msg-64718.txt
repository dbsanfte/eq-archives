If you look on the EQ site they ran the new version on much less.  My
machines only have the original three and there is no real difference in
speed, again much lower specs.  No lock ups.  My boys always use 640x480
mode for some reason so maybe that's the difference.  Your soundcard is
pretty old, that may be causing the issues, everything else looks very
current.
