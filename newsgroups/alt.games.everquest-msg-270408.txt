>Nobody can beat mighty Santa !

Please don't feed the troll. If you must, trim scot.tld so he can't
"keep score".

(Though I loved the responses...the main problem with Bruno is, in
addition to being a troll, he's a very BAD troll. We're talking
conning grey with 2 down arrows to a first level commoner. Half the
time, people respond to his posts with interesting and amusing
insights rather than the mindless flames he's trying to generate. It's
almost sad. He's like the Ed Wood of trolls. You watch him to see how
badly he'll fail. He tries sooooo hard, and yet...he's so BAD at it.)
