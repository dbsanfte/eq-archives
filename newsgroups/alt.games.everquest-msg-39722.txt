This is correct , but one thing to keep in mind, offhand gets no bonus. I'm
not a 100% sure if this applies to classes other than monks but monks get a
damage bonus for primary hand , whether it be fist or a 1hb weapon. so
putting the fastest weapon in your primary always results in more damage
after lv 28.
The really nice thing about the bonus is your damage in the primary can
never drop below (1 + bonus).

The following is taken from the Monkly Business web page.

 You'll notice that Damage Bonuses do not begin until level 28. Bare in mind
also that only the "Primary" slot weapon gains a Damage Bonus. The "Offhand"
weapon has no bonus whatsoever.
[DAMAGE BONUSES; One Hand Blunt / Hand To Hand]
DamageBonus = (Level - 25) / 3
* Damage Bonuses are always rounded down (ie, 7.65 = 7)(1-27) = 0
(28) = 1
(29) = 1
(30) = 1
(31) = 2
(32) = 2
(33) = 2
(34) = 3
(35) = 3
(36) = 3
(37) = 4
(38) = 4
(39) = 4
(40) = 5
(41) = 5
(42) = 5
(43) = 6
(44) = 6
(45) = 6
(46) = 7
(47) = 7
(48) = 7
(49) = 8
(50) = 8
(51) = 8
(52) = 9

(54) = 9
