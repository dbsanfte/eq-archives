Hmm, and although my shaman isn't there yet, when he gets his Incomplete Heal he'll
want an even bigger pool, for highest mana efficiency you want the heal to hit for
full.  Of course a few levels later he may have Torpor and go back to thinking on
the same lines I do with Stoicism now... but still, its another reason you'd want a
large HP pool, as is the fact that you might want clerics to Cheal you if you turn
out to be the weak link, person who uses the most mana and thus ends up slowing down
the group; again, you want a deep deep pool so you can Canni lots and lots of HP
away and get the most benefit out of the Cheal you can manage.  NOw we are talking
"main tank" levels of HP, 7500 for the Cheal plus another 500+ for a large enough
buffer to avoid low HP aggro?  Tell me most druids wander around with that kind of
HP and really make use of it.
