But you have to shove some birds aside first.  Whee!

You can also jump off the middle of the "dragon bridge" that
connects Iceclad Ocean to Eastern Wastes.  It's a LONG drop
(far larger than the Lake Rathetear "diving board"), but
you'll be okay as long as you're over the deep water.

One time, though, I slipped over the edge and impacted
on the shore about five feet from the water.  "Missed it
by *that* much..."   LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...
