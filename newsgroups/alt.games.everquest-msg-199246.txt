: The problem with x-teams is this;

The real problem with x-teaming isn't that they cant help it is when they
can help and you cant do anything about it.

My group all dark; 2 Ogre SK's, 1 Ogre Warior, 2 DE clerics, Ogre Shaman,
encounters a group consisting of 3 Dwarf Warriors, a DE cleric, and an Iksar
Shaman.

Normaly if this was an all light team we would murder them. Ie clearic gone,
shaman gone, wariors running.  But since they have a dark elf healing them
and an Iksar Shanam buffing them, Cancel magicing us (not considered a
detrimental spell), the 5 of them make easy work of the 6 of us. there 3
wariors wipe our clerics, then our Shaman, by that time we know it is over.

I would love to se SOE add a little code that said if you had members from 2
diferent teams than no one in that group could fight eather team.  Make it
so we could still target there lighties, but that they couldn't fight back
because they where walking with the enemy.  =)  Or make it so no Combat
could take place at all in that situation.  Never mind I just saw how they
would get around that. ( 2 Groups )  It was nice to dream for a moment.

If SOE would just make all classes available to all the teams, there
wouldn't be a need to X-Team.  Give the darks an Un Kemp Druid, Ranger ( I
want an Iksar/Ogre Ranger ), and Bard ( what we darlies have no tails to
tell???) SOE can keep the Paladin. (just wouldn't fit in, and who needs them
when you have the rest)  The only problem they would have is the diety
recuirements.
