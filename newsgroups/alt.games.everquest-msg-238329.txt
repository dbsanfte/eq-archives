   It is a term, yes.  But I don't think that it an insulting one.  Now, if one
happens to thing poorly of characters that are played thusly, one might consider
the term to be an insult.

   Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that Merriam-Websters's Online
(http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=mangina) can give us
any insight into this dispute.  So, until they get around to adding it (and
ironically they do have an entry for "slacker", though I happen to disagree with
part of it) we get use the term in the manner that we feel is best.

   You can be a hater, if you like.  Me, I meant no insult or disrespect to
males who play female characters.
