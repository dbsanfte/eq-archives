I agree that druids are given the tools needed to be main healer.
(This really peeved a lot of clerics in the days post-iCH and
pre-PoP, since it meant a lot of clerics were left begging for groups.)

Since I play a cleric, when I'm grouped with a druid it's inevitable that
the druid wind up as DPS and perhaps backup healer. My main experience
with druids as main healers is trying to convince one to replace me. :-)

And also, in some cases, convincing the group to *take* a druid to
replace me.

I see what you mean about many druids, as a soloing class, lacking
the skills to be main healer. Unfortunately the situation is self-
perpetuating. Hopefully it will become less so as druids become more
familiar with grouping in settings such as LDoN - i.e. druids will
group more, so gain the skills, and so will be trusted more as main
healers.

My understanding is that to some extent the druid community is divided
on their roles in groups. Some want to be healers, and some want to be
DPS. As the second-best healers and third-best nukers in the game, it
puts druids in a difficult position when trying to find a group spot.
It also means that druids get something of a reputation for wanting
*everything*, since the healer druids are asking for better heals while
the nukers are asking for better DPS, creating the impression that
druids want everything that the other classes have... when in fact
it's just a difference of opinion amongst druids.

Yes, the domain is sad, but effective. :-)
