About the only time I'll see a necro twitching in a group is to
balance out mana after a particularly bad pull. The good necros will
do that without being asked just to reduce the downtime but it's
hardly a reason to invite them into a group. Are they useful in a
group, it depends on who you ask, I guess. 

A lot of people seem to think that they aren't all that useful but I
love having one in my groups and will always get one if they're
available. A good grouping necro can do a lot more than just add DPS
and the ones that know all their spells are always great to have
around. Dunno how well they do on raids though.
