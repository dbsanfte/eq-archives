I waited until probably 3 or 4 months after it came out, had not heard
anything about it really, OK, I was a major bookworm.  I was totally blown
away by it.  As for Alien, how could you not see the chest bursting scene
coming, I saw it the day it came out, knowing nothing about it but that it
was scifi, and they just made it so obvious that that was what was going to
happen.
