One major thing about the BB LDoN adventures, those poison and disease 
traps are horrendous. As a cleric, I can not help but make it perfectly 
clear that a high poison and disease resist is very important. The Rat 
Shaped Ring is a relatively easy to obtain finger item, 15/15 
poison/disease resist ring.

Also, if you see a particular room has a trap in it, please *do* try to 
get the party camped in a room without a trap, and be careful to pull to 
them. I have been stuck in a trapped room on a couple of bad pickup 
groups and the mana poured out in pure blooding people made things dicy 
on a few pulls. if you notice a trap in a room, tell the people in the 
party not to wander there while between pulls if there is med down 
time=\ monks are notorious for running around in little circles and 
patterns, one i was grouped with got hit more than once=\
