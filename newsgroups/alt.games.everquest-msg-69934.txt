I'll know in a few days.  I went to Dell's refurbished site and bought a
P4-1.7, GF2MX200(32) and 256MB Rambus for $620.  I didn't MEAN to buy
Rambus...had I even noticed it before I would have probably ordered
something else.

But after doing a little research (mostly on RAM upgrade prices) I found
that I use PC800 RAM which is 800MHz.  So I'm hoping that at 256MB RAM I'll
be ok for a bit.  Rambus isn't TOO expensive at www.pricewatch.com, but I'd
rather hold off until RAM in general comes down again.
