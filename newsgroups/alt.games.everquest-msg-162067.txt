Don't look at it as double trivial level. It's trivial by less than 20
points. That is NOT "*way* trivial". That's "barely trivial". By your
logic, something that trivialed as 1 would be "*way* trivial" at 2...

THis is your opinion. Unfortunately for you, your opinion doesn't mesh
with that of the people who made the game. Oh well, tough shit, come
back and whine when you fail something worth whining about. You failed
metal bits. Your out less than a GP per. Boo-hoo.

It does. You were failing a LOT more at skill 18, right? Also note
that it IS random. a 1% overall fail rate can still fail 5 out of 10
tries if you have a run of bad luck. The fact you can't raise skill
doesn't mean it's foolproof or even easy. You can still fuck it up,
it's just so basic that you don't learn anything new from it.
