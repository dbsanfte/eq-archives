You won't get any arguement out of me here. Although I really don't
begrudge the Bards their power, you don't find very many Bards out
there that play to their full potential and those have to work at it.
I think it's the hardest class to play well so I don't envy the power
of a well-played bard.

Is their MR debuff only -15? I tend to notice a big difference when a
bard is debuffing on incoming. This is from the perspective of a
shaman that doesn't have his GoD slow though. Their debuff is the
difference between having to Malo first or slowing first on a tough
mob.

Talking about Hard, I assume? Taking any kind of CC on a normal
adventure just gets boring. <g>

Irrelevant if the bard is pulling. He might have a longer pull path
but he's not tied down doing anything else once the previous mob is
engaged so has plenty of time to get the next mob in position.

It's a huge difference, if we're still talking about content that a
group can just barely do. I used to group with one of the best
equipped enchanters on our server and there it didn't make a
difference. He had 8k hitpoints and could take a couple of hits when
things go wrong. Change that to an enchanter with 4 or 5k hitpoints
and things change drastically. The bard can take a couple of hits when
things go wrong, the chanter can't. 

This is coming from the perspective of a 65 shaman. I work a lot
smoother with a good pulling bard than with an enchanter and I think I
can safely say I've grouped with some of the best ones on Bristlebane.
I might not enjoy raiding but I had a lot of friends that moved on to
the top raid guild on our server and we still used to group often.
 ... speaking in the past tense here cuz GoD seemed to take a major
toll on the raiders I knew. All the ones that had been around and
raiding for years seemed to get burned out and quit not long after GoD
came out.

No debate there. I've never been one to hold out for a 'perfect'
group. I'll see what friends are online and want to do something, then
take a group to some place that we can handle with whoever's
available. Doesn't mean that I can't recognize the power of a good
bard though.

You're looking at it from the perspective of post-time geared people.
The int casters you group with have more hitpoints than the knights I
group with (but I'll save that rant for another day).

You lost me about halfway through that paragraph but I disagree with
what I did understand. Bard is the only puller I'd rate above a monk
in a hard LDoN. 

As for desirability in general,  I love monks and wouldn't ever turn
one down in a group. The combination of pulling ability, decent
tankage and excellent DPS is hard to beat.

I've always said that my favorite group for anything but the highest
end content would be my shaman, a ranger for tracking/snare and 4
monks. 6 decent tanks and excellent DPS, just pull trains and let the
mayhem begin! :p

Doesn't alter the fact that some classes have it easier than others.

Worse imo. A bard that isn't played well is pretty damn worthless, a
monk or SK that isn't played well is still useful for DPS or tanking.
