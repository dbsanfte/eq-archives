I dont even see HOW it can be more buggy than the opening release of AO. Had the
(dis)pleasure of being at a friends house the day AO opened, and seeing my 2
friends get more and more frustrated as the problems went on was really fun.
Even think AO is gonna kick Daggerfall from the top of my list of "shoud have
been tested just a little more (or just a little, period) games.
