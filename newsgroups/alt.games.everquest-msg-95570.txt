Hello all!!! I just got the game a few weeks ago, and im impressed!!! I have
a level 11 Wiz named Imortus on the Nameless Server, drop me a tell or
whatever if you play on that server. Koodos to sony for a game well made and
very hard. Its been a long time since I've played a game that was this
challenging and fun at the same time. Happy Hunting!!!!!!
