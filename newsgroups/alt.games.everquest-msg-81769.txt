Any caster over level 12, IIRC.  You can just /shout that you're looking for
a bind (helps to say whereabouts, like "main Kelethin lift"), and if there's
a caster around, they'll usually hook you up.

Alternatively, you can find a soulbinder NPC, talk to them, and they'll bind
you right there in front of them.  I think the phrase you have to say is
"bind my soul".  if that doesn't work, just hail them and they should tell
you what to say.
