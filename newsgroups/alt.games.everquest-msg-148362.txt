    Zone has a named mob cycle, itemized (and some loot isn't bad like the
Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate). All mobs in the cycle blue to 60, the PH
Forager and Hunter can drop Kunark 51-54 spells. The Keepers are actually
weak enough on HPs that I used to solo them as a HP cleric (so fairly low
mana pool). Just have fair resists and you're fine. And guess what - over
near the Emperor's cave (quest NPC for the Sebilis key), there's so many of
these things waiting to be single-pulled that I doubt a full group could run
out of spawns. But of course, there's never a full group there. I also (in
my Keeper killing days) used to see wizards snare-kite cockatrices near the
Emerald Jungle zone, but with quadding I doubt that would be considered good
XP anymore.

    As for the Treasure Hunters, that is a serious problem in a number of
older zones - low level mobs in the middle of a higher-level zone. Look at
the mix of Aqua Goblins near the underwater tower in Lake Rathetear for an
example of this - mobs that would be green to someone of a certain level
spawn right beside mobs that would be red to the same person. Making the
spawn levels more uniform, and then mentioning it in a patch message, would
go a long way towards repopulating these areas.

    Lots of the "hard hard" mobs, like those dinosaur things, are still
light blue at 60 so that might be why they're tough. I remember the
mosquitos were very soloable. I've never pulled the Iksar camps there, so no
idea what those would be like. I still remember, a long time ago, running
through the plateau of the zone for the first time to go res some druid and
seeing Sev wander past in the distance. Might have been one of the last
times the poor dragon was left up more than a few seconds!
