I solved the problem by setting up a little demo.

Have everyone back off. Have the puller pull 3 or 4 mobs. Cast AE mez
and let them watch as they just sit there. Then go up and hit one to
demonstrate that hitting a mob breaks the mez.

Didn't take long for them to get the idea.

Telling me to mez is like telling me to have sex (I don't need to be
told to do either)
