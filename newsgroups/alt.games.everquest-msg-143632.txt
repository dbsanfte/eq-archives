Well, not really.   Bracer of the hidden can serve as an (admittedly poor)
instaclilck item.

Instaclick items are essential for a *lot* of high level raiding, and about
the cheapest you can buy a good one is a Shurnken Goblin Earring for about
6500 (on E'ci Bazaar)

Assuming the choker is see invisible while  you're wearing it, not "right
click instant cast", it wouldn't be worth nearly as much.
