Then don't try it "as written" with the starting factions that are
supposed to work. You start out by default, at apprehensive. This is
*supposed* to be good enough to do the initial steps in Sol Ro, Erudin,
and Halas. The bumps you get there are *supposed* to nudge you up high
enough that when you get sent to take the ring to the chick in Kelethin
and come back, that Arantir will set you off on the last three steps.
However, it's broken. He'll give you the ring and thank you when you
come back with it, then tell you that you are a pile of shit, etc. and
not give you the note for Kandin in BB.

And don't even *try* turning in the three staffs to him with that
faction. He's eat them. Allegedly doing the invis trick to get to
indifferent will work for the staff turnin, but I did the Shammy epic
quest first steps for a few hours to get to amiable with TS. Then I was
able to turn in the staffs and get my epic with no hassle.

Make sure your faction is good with TS before you turn in *any* staffs,
or turn in the green oil from Fear to Kandin. And by good, I mean better
than what it's supposed to be by a long shot.
