I've been in a lot of odd groups myself, as a druid. I can honestly say 
that's my favorite thing about Druids- versatility. With a druid in the 
group you always have a healer, a nuker, a tracker, crowd control, 
buffer... We can do it all. I have noticed, however, that the only way an 
unbalanced group works REALLY well is if the group has more melee than 
casters. Caster-heavy groups tend to accumulate more downtime.
