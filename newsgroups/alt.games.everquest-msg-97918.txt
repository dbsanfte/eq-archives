 >> /pet get lost will now kill the buff as well as the familiar <<

I'm a wee bit upset by this, my Familiar always stands *right* in front of
me when I'm casting, more often than not totally obscuring the view of my
target. This is extremely off-putting, and can actually be rather dangerous
as I can't see the target break root until just slightly after it's moved,
as we all know, a split second can mean rather a lot in some situations. Ah
well, pet get lost was good whilst it lasted ..

Safe hunting to all ..

Stevie.
