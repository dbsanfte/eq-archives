This is 100% true. Yesterday, I was going to go rock climbing, then
whitewater rafting, then spend the night with a pair of bisexual
supermodels. Unfortunately, I had a raid.

Here's a hint: Talk to the people who play 40+ hours a week. Get to
know them. Now, try to imagine them doing anything else. If they
weren't playing EQ, they would be sprawled out in front of the TV.
