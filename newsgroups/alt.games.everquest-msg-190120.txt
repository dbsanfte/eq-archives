Ah, I get it now.  I agree.  Make the sale immediate.  So the broker has two
innate abilities.  Access to home city market in real time, and immediate
teleport of funds and purchased goods.  Broker fee would only be charged to
the buyer.  The seller has not agreed to a broker fee, but buyer does
implicitely by purchasing through the broker.

Looks doable and scalable.  Now, do you think anyone is listening?

Cheers,
Eric
