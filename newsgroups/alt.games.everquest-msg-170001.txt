Enchanters get "improved" versions of mem blur as well.  As far as I've
been able to tell, the only improvements are one that's AE, and the
other that just costs more mana, takes longer to cast.

I'm not sure how well atone works but my impression is that it does
better than any in the Enchanter Mem-blur line.

I haven't really tried either (I don't have a cleric that high yet)
since the lull patch, but I wonder if that might have made them work
better?  I'll have to try it again...
