For sheer damage output I would look for higher damage 2-handers.  Pets are
not affected by the delay of whatever weapon you give them.  I know pets are
not able to use weighted axes but I have been giving my Mage's pet some
fairly decent damage output 2-handers that my warrior farms off of Frost
Giants.
