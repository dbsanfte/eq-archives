THIS I will accept as a legitimate gripe from you guys.  No arguement
whatsoever.

I didnt check to see the weight on the Small Tailoring Kit, but if all
you need the kit for is to combine them, I am almost willing to bet
thier weight is the same or around 1 weight. Small Tailoring Kits have
2 slots.  Silk Swatches and Threads take 2 silks.  Problem solved.

Sure I would be upset, but moreso because the that is an unrealistic
weight change.

I agree.  The certainly did.  Like I said in another message it was
the people screaming about combining items they didnt want that
brought this about.  If Verant hadnt heard enough of that to make them
feel a change was warranted they wouldnt have looked for a
compensation and they could still be abused.

From the sounds of it you are using a tailoring kit because you need
it for your skill, not because you have 7 of them and a lightstone and
for that I commend you.  You are getting hurt by this because of what
you do, not because of what you are trying to get around.
