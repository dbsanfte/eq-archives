There was a very famous texas judge that always started a murder trial with
an examintaion of the victim . First the question of did the murdered man
deserve his fate had to be answered before the question of the guilt of the
accused was even considered. Eq has always failed to do this and has
resulted in some of their spectacular mistakes, costing them huge amounts of
buisness and good will.

The unholy monk nerf would have never even been attempted if they had just
sat down and examined how well monks interacted with others before they
considered drastic nerfs.

Magicians are by no means one of the unholy powerfull eq classes. In point
of fact they are a bit rare . Before addressing such minutae as pet canni
they should have examined the relative power of magicians. Ask first where
they stand before removing their legs :)

I rank the overall utility of the classes as follows in order. Magicians
aint anywhere near the top of the heap.(this is a group listing not a raid
listing ,raids change things around lots,and is a percentage of either over
or under poweredness with 100% being about right ). This is also completely
subjective from my personal opinion and im sure others will wildly disagree.
