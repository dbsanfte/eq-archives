If you move from one account to another on the same server you keep 
*everything*, cash, items, nodrop items, whatever. I know, I've moved a 
character onto a secondary account on the same server. Both accounts have 
to have the same billing info.

If you move between servers you move naked, you keep nothing (unless it is 
a move via a /movelog as part of an advertised server split, in which case 
you keep everything). The confusion is that some folk believe you keep your 
nodrop items. You don't - you lose everything. Casters are better off here, 
since at least you keep your already-scribed spells, and don't have to buy 
those again.
