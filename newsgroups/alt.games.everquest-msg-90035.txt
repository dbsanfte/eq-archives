OkI understand.   Put your monk and druid in the same account.  Then
put the Necro and shaman on the other account.  

The druid is not much help to the monk but the monk and necro could
work together well with fear kiting.  Shaman and druid will work fine
together.  The nero and shaman would be great with two pets and DOT's
but I guess you have to figure that one out.
