I'd be happy if you could just cast spells directly from
the spellbook.  Of course, this would require a situation
where a mob wouldn't immediately smack you for sitting down,
interrupting your spellbook session.  So it would be mostly
useful for buffing situations, and/or other situations where
you'd have had time and ability to just remem a spell anyway.

And from an RP sense, surely any caster would be competent
enough to just read a bloody spell directly out of his
spellbook as he casts it, instead of having to memorize it,
close the book, then cast it from memory.
