My automatic response to a Casino is /ignore.  I have yet to take one off,
either.  That causes some people to never get a KEI from me, and to not get
TLs from my wizard or resses from my love's cleric (I've been known to go
from zone to zone doing free clicks in graveyards when I'm bored), and I
certainly never group with them - but that's the price of their doing that
business.
