No, that's your perception of what 'most people' think.  Since you can't
have asked 'most people', and since 'most people' don't post anywhere,
you're generalising to make your point.

My only point is that there is no one true way.  People play the game how
they wish, and I play the game in a way which matches my style and
preference, and for me it works.  You said 'there is no good reason', but
there are valid reasons for playing with split XP/AA, you just don't agree
with them, that's fine, but it doesn't make them any less valid.

Split XP/AA means I don't get burned out just doing XP and not seeing any
regular rewards, it means every day I play I see an AA turn up, feel like
I've achieved a goal, and yet still moved towards the next level.  Getting
from 69 to 70 in a casual guild with casual members takes a very, very long
time.  If that's all I did, I'd get burned out, bored and give up.  So I
don't, I split the XP/AA so that I see gradual rewards while still reaching
both my targets eventually.  I make no claim about efficiency, speed,
gradual benefits, all I claim is that it helps me retain my interest in the
game.
