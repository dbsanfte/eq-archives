I'm a bit surprised that no one has yet mentioned my all-time favorite
fantasy series after Tolkien -- Patricia McKillip's Riddlemaster of
Hed trilogy.

Has all the "magic" of Tolkien; she has a wonderful ear for names and
writes beautifully.  IMO she is one of the very, very few post-Tolkien
fantasy writers deserving an epithet other than "hack."
