Ensnare lasts a lot longer, in Jagged Pine I could fear-kite Timber Griffins
with Snare, but I had to use Ensnare for the Timber Griffons, as they took a
while longer to kill - unfortunately Rangers have to wait until level 49 for
the upgrade - which meant when I first started hunting Timber Griffons I had
to reapply snare at least once.
