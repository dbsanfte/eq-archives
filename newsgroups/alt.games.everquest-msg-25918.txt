She is a RARE spawn, she pops at 1500, 500, and have orc pawns as PHs. Dont know
the spawn time, she showed up for me after 1 hour, just when i decided to check
the spawn time.
I have talked to another druid who have used over 58 RL hours so far without
seeing her.
So just get your ass to 1500, 500 in GFay, and kill the pawns that spawn, and
hope she pop soon.

Oh, and she depops after you give her the coin, so if another druid is waiting
too, dont bother.
