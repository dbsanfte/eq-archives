I honestly think its because DMF for necros is a low mana spell I
guess with no ingredient, right? I guess the necro is bored and feels
like being helpful, sort of like how someone who can sow might run
by you and cast it.

Aahah yeah I felt the same thing. As a druid I never liked lev, I used
it over areas of water or lava, that was it. I did not like floating
around and bobbing. Of course now I got used to it because SOE (spirit
of Eagle) is so nice. Since I have spirit of eagle on all the time
now, no one can DMF me in passing.. BAHAHA. SOE is a VERY long sow
with infra,  (don't need that... wood elf), levitate (with no
batwings!) and see invis. I like having see invis on for some reason
so I really like this spell.

I guess the necros just have a need to help others or maybe hope it
will get a clarity or sow tossed their way.
