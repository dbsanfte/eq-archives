To criticize my own people for a minute... how many Americans supported the
IRA before 11 Sep 01?  How many still refuse to support Isreal?  If we
actively supported one terrorist group, and refuse to support Isreal in
their fight against another... how are we supposed to ask Europe (especially
Britian) to take us seriously?  What happend on that day was an atrocity,
and as far as I know, the largest ever loss of civilian life outside a war,
but we're not the first to have to deal with terrorism.
