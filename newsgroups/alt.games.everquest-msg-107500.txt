For my money, the Cougarskin Mask is better.  6ac 2dex 2agi 10hp.
Quest is easy to do too.

I do kinda like keeping the strength up, which is my ranger is still
wearing crappy Jagged bands.  3ac 5str.

Ice Forged Shackle is a NICE wrist item.  10ac 5str 5dex 5agi 30hp and
has a right click effect of Velium Shards.  Crappy 12 point nuke, but
better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.  :-)

My ranger was just working on this quest moments before I logged.  Got
the Strong Raptor gut off the second tigerraptor I killed in WL, but
those damned flying monkeys just would NOT drop a strong stick for me.

Don't look down on the old standby, Treeweave.  25ac and 10str is
nothing to sneeze at.  And they can be got for well under 1k nowadays.

Lizardscale mantle is 3 more ac and the same dex, IIRC.
