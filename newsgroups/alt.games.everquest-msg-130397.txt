I'm not evading the question.  You are attempting
to beg the question by using the "what other"
phrase.

However, many nations have bombed US ships, shot down 
US planes, captured US forces, etc. both accidentally
and on purpose without there being war declared or, in fact,
without it affecting relationships in the long term.
The most recent example is the downing of our spy 
plane near China.

What was that about evading the question?

Hmm... I glad to see the history education is as bad
in the UK as it seems to be in public schools on this
side of the pond.  I hate to shock you, but relations
between the US and Britain normalized well before 1964.

But, OK.  According to you, Mark, how many years
*should* it have been before Americans stopped
killing Brits on sight?
