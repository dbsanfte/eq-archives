That's weird. My level 60 wiz has max (ooh, 145!) defense, and O'kiels
levity (Component-free lev that happens to have a 5pt damage shield) has
boosted my Offense over 100 as well. Maybe I just get beat up more than you,
Jazz :) But if I get my hands on that pure-caster charm whose stats go up
for each melee skill you max, I may have to try and raise my lamentable
piercing and 1HB (god forbid, hand to hand!)
