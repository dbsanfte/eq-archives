> - pets (mobs always prefer whacking a PCs to a pets)

Small quibble: This only applies to PC's in melee range of the mob, its 
quite common for a pet to get hit by mobs while everyone else is out of 
melee range.

This is of course self evident when the pet caster is sitting nearby 
while his pet is meleeing a mob to death toe to toe, but its also been a 
very noticable phenomenum with me recently on my berserker with a mage 
partner using an Air pet.  The air pet procs a stun which has a 
knockback component, slowly forcing the mob away.  If I'm not attentive, 
it will move the mob just out of melee range from me, and I'll start 
getting misses while the mob starts beating down the pet.

If my hate generation is high, this doesn't happen, as each time the pet 
pushes the mob out of range, it simply steps back towards me and keeps 
fighting, but as stuns are very high aggro producers, its quite common 
that I'm not on top of the hate list at all, which is immediately 
visible when the mob is pushed out of melee range from me.

Oh, another instance where the mob will  attack pet with PC in melee 
range; if the PC isn't on the hate list at all.  This happens when the 
PC isn't KOS to the mob, and hasn't done anything to the mob nor healed 
or buffed anyone that is on his hate list.  (for pet classes, sending 
their pet is sufficient to get on the list)

All small quibbles of course because the general topic was paladins 
getting aggro, and a paladin is generally going to be in melee range and 
doing stuff to the mob.
