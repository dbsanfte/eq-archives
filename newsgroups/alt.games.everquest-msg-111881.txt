We have a fairly small guild - but we managed to put 24 people in 
skyfire in 15minutes.  We still almost lost Rage to a group prepping
for him - my buddy pulled him, then they went in to try an grab
him.  He went back and used all his high aggro spells while meleeing
the sucker for about 10secs to regain aggro.  Of course, the morons
who tried to steal Rage then tried to shitlist him on the server
boards.
