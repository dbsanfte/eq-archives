You should've parsed it.  With identical haste and similar str you will
do significantly more damage with Wurmslayer than Lamentation in your
30s, with the gap closing steadily until somewhere in your 50s.

Fatigue only matters if you need to jump (not exactly common in melee)
or your sta is below 100.  Fatigue has no negative impact on melee if
you sta is 100 or higher.

Oh, that doesn't sound good.  Better get yerself into the lodge and
curl up next to the fire with some camomile tea.  You Rangers wouldn't
be such sickly little fellers if you'd just follow your mother's advice
stay in out of the rain, instead of always traipsing around in who
knows what kind of weather trying to catch your death of cold.
