These are good tricks.  Another is to type in /target the_corpse_name... 
which can be shortened to /tar the_c  as long as there's nothing in 
target range with the same start to its name.  I first saw this 
suggestion here in the newsgroup and have used it to the amazement of 
group mates on many an LDoN, after their repeated efforts to loot 
something have failed, I walk up and loot in two seconds.

But they don't address the problem we are talking about here, which is 
not an inability to target a body due to its being stuck under the floor 
or in a wall or something irritating like that, but a rarer yet much 
more annoying one of being unable to do anything via mouse once you have 
the body selected; can't click on the items to loot them, can't cast 
spells, can't sit down (without using /sit command instead of clicking 
on sit), etc. etc.

There's a similar zone wide bug that happens from time to time where 
nobody can cast spells till they've zoned out and back in or logged out 
and back on; this one is even more crippling, but only to the person its 
happening to.

I don't have a better solution once it happens than to go ahead and zone 
or log (although waiting does clear it up occaisionally), but I did 
suggest a possible cause and therefore way to avoid it which seems to be 
working for me; make very very sure you aren't moving before you start 
looting.
