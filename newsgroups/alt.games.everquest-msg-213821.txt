The shaman will stand where?
The DC will hit for 1250hps of damage.  Even a level 60 shaman with
PoP buffs probably will have about 4500hps enough to take three hits
before going low health aggroing the piss outta the dragon and getting
ganked.  And more than likely 4 groups of mid-50's won't have the DPS
(especially after getting slowed by 70% from DC) to kill Hoshkar's
Twin before it pops off at least three AEs.

While in theory it works, in practice it's not so simple.

Not optimal?
Dude, it's not a case of "oh we wasted mana but still won".  It's "we
drained mana too fast, we lost".

So you're saying four groups of mid 50's with one level 60 SK will
have a "trivial" time with ToVN dragons? 

Or are you still thinking it's gonna be a bunch of level 65's with
200+ AA with PoP gear ganking yellow con dragons in ToVN?  Because the
latter is a cake walk and you can probably do it with 2 groups--why, I
don't know since most of the drops are junk these days.

On the other hand, 24 mid 50's with a level 60 SK as the primary tank
against dragons like Aary or Hoshkar's Twin will result in a total
wipe.  There's no way in hell 24 mid 50's is going to generate enough
DPS to kill Aary before the chickens respawn.  Having just a few
chickens in amongst your casters is a great way to wipe.  And wiping
on that hallway can be rather ugly since those chain rampaging wyverns
will no doubt keep you from doing any sort of recovery other than
summon corpses.

Hell, even if they managed to get past Aary's spawn because he wasn't
up, one "oopsie" pull of those chain flurry melee bubble the size of
raisins defenders will no doubt do a number on that raid.
