The problems you've experienced only occure when you mix DIMMS from
different manufactures.  Certain DIMMS from different manufactures require
different voltages to run at your front side bus speed.  I would say,
chances are very high you've mixed DIMMS from two different manufactures,
and aren't getting along don't get along.

If you're going to return the DIMM, I suggest you figure out who
manufactured your current memroy DIMM and buy another one.

I guess there's a chance the DIMM is bad or has a fault...but those
components are tested pretty well before they leave the factory.

You are now wiser Grasshop'a.
