Gargoyles in OOT. I made about 1kpp there from 18-24 selling the garg eyes
which paid for my focus items and some upgraded equipment. I'd highly
recommend using the earth pet. Kill the skeletons to make gargoyles spawn
and do NOT go up to the top of the island and introduce yourself to the
spectres.
