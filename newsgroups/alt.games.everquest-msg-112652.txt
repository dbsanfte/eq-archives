I'm only LV7.
I am in Neriak 3rd Quarter (zone - lowest level of Neriak).
I have just bought my remaining LV8 spells.
I have not memorized any spells yet (I had died and decided to return to
finish buying spells).
I don't want to walk across 3 zones to get back to Nektulos.
I decide to have my guildmaster teleport me to Nektulos.

Same question for any other use of this situation.
Say you just finished some quests in Qeynos, and would like to return to
Freeport where you are bound at, so you attack a guard to have them send you
there.
Now that we respawn with our items on our body up through LV10, this is
something that is very helpful, even more for non-casters.
Some argue using gate instead.
By now I know exactly where the spells I memorize are located, and I
memorize them rather fast. Faster than the time it would take to regain the
mana I'd use by casting gate. And what if I couldn't cast gate? Then this is
a very good idea.
