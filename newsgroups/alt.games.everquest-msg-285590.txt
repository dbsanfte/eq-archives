I've been of the impression that if a PC is in range of the mob, the mob 
will always turn from the pet to attack the PC. However, I have seen my 
pets draw aggro *from* me, causing me to work hard to get it back and keep 
the pet from going down.

The fact that pets taunt pretty much indicates that they *can* have aggro 
over a PC, I would think, so my question is, what are the particulars of 
pet aggro? Does it work just like PC aggro while incurring a penalty, 
perhaps?
