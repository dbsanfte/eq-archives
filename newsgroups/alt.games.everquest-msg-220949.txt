And if you are like me, my friends and I will get silly and watch cheesy 
horror movies for the continuity errors...

ED2 - the 'book' gets chucked down into the basement with the monster, 
and Ash has to go retrieve it. You see him, chainsaw on his right hand, 
reaching for the pages with his left and tucking them under his right 
arm...until the time he reaches out with his right hand to grab a 
page....grin

The main difference between first and second evil dead is mainly the 
first one was made on a budget of less than 10K$US and the second one 
was made with 1 or 200 K$us. The third one is fun for its poking fun 
subtly at previous movies...his 'magic words' are klaatu borada nicto, a 
paeon to 'the day the earth stood still' from the 50s.
