I haven't played my lvl 47 druid in a few weeks.  Today I'm hunting Specs in
Oasis, and my harmony spell won't stick on any of them!  I tried it on Dervs
with the same result.  Has something happened to the harmony spell to make
it less effective?  I've used it hundreds of times and have never NEVER had
it fail before.
