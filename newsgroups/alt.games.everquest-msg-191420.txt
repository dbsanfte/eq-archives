Hi there.

I know this is likely been answered a jillion times, but I am still a bit
confused. Evidently my RL INT and WIS are sub-75....

OK, I have a lvl 40 .5 Elf Ranger. All applicable skills are maxed for the
level. My question regards placement of weapons for maximimum DPS. I have
Silver Chitin Hand-wraps. I have a Lamentation, Venemous Axe of the Vellium
Brood, and a Dragonhorn Yak. I just bought the Lammy thinking it would be a
far superior weapon to the axe, but somehow I seem to be missing far more
often. So... completely disregarding aggro build-up, which weapon should I
put where, and am I missing some simple facts?

Also: I am saving up for a Wurmslayer. Toss that rascal  into the equation,
for group hunting, and what combo would be best?

Any high-speed, low-drag Rangers care to help me out here? I need a clue...
