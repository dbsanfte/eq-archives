It's not so easy to have something classified a hate crime even where we
have those laws.  Even though the perp was screaming how he hated Jews just
before he killed one (a man who was clearly identifiable as a Jew by the way
he was dressed) in Toronto a few weeks ago  it still AFAIK  not been
classified a hate crime although the Jewish community has asked for it to be
(they are supported in this by many outside the Jewish community).
