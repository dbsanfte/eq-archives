You're welcome.

And if I come off a little unfriendly at first, blame my 45 levels as a
druid.  They've left me jaded, angst-ridden and prone to violent outbursts.
I would play my necro, but druids are just so fun, even if everybody and
their little brother wants something from me for free. (I recently went
fulltime /role just because I got sick of the deluge, 45 levels of
non-anonymity...  the silence is... ah... freeing.)
