After much waffling, I've finally decided I prefer the old models and
have gone back to them.  The problem is that I no longer see Ry'Gorr
chain leggings, for example, as having a unique texture; they look
just like normal chain.

In my eqclient.ini I do have LoadVeliousArmor=TRUE as a line (in
addition to those LoadArmor17=TRUE, etc. lines), but that line comes
before all the UseLuclinHumanMale, etc. lines, and I'm wondering if
that could be the problem.

Has anyone else had the same problem and if so, how did you solve it?

Thanks.
