what if this guy impersonated a GM:

FakeGM: Hi I am GM Blahtyfast there has been a patch problem, please give me
your account name and password so I can verify your characters wont be
delted.

NaivePlayer: Oh, OK GM Blahtyfast here are my details, thank you for your
concern

If this person has tried it once, who is to say they havent nor will not try
it again?

Lokari did the *right* thing, fullstop.
