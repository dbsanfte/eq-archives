I've not heard anything about them being linked to the dwarfs, but then
again I've never killed them, so I don't know. I have done some of the
quests with them - not bad quests but nothing to loose sleep over if you
can't do it. Did you notice any faction hits? If so can you remeber what
they are (you've perked my interest now!)
