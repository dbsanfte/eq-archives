Well, if you really want to be viewed as just another troll...

/flame
What's the matter "jackass"?  Can't even get ports from guild Druids
now?  Lame-assed "ubers" like you make me sick.  Bullying people in
game, demanding that VI kowtow to your every whim, pretending that
all the other 12 year-old partners in masturbation you've guilded with
are your friends when you and I know that not one of you gives a shit
about anything except whether yer gonna get some lewt at today's raid
and when's yer older sister gonna get outa the bathroom so you can go
choke-the-chicken while drooling on the barbarian-in-chain screen shot
you just printed out...
/flame

Sorry, best I could do on short notice.
