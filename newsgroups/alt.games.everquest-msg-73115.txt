The UK server is non-PvP, it is called Antonius Bayle.  All the PvP servers,
and all the rest of the non-PvP servers are located in San Diego, CA.

Not having the expansions will also put some other limits on the game, you
will have a maximum level of 50, unless you purchase the Velious expansion.
There were also some nice improvements in the user interface introduced with
the Velious expansion.  Still, you will be able to get a good idea whether
or not you like the game without the expansions.  There is a triple pack
available for sale, that contains the original game, and the first two
expansions The Ruins of Kunark, and Scars of Velious.

A Cleric or Paladin of sufficiently high level can also cast a spell on your
corpse that will summon you to the corpse, and may restore some or most of
the xp you lost from dying.  The amount of xp restored depends on the level
of the spell that is cast.  Also, a Necromancer or a ShadowKnight (I think),
can summon your corpse from wherever it is to him, if he is in the same
zone, but this requires an expensive component to be used for casting the
spell.  This is sometimes the only way to get your corpse back in a
reasonable amount of time.

There are also NPCs that will bind you now in most starting cities, and a
few other selected cities.
