I've only used Win XP's switching with App Compatibility installed
since I usually 2 boxes using 2 separate PCs.  Someone would probably
have better idea what works the best.

It does make a difference.  I'd suggest lowering the frame rate to
something like 25 or 30 for main and lower for secondary and depth as
well to minimum.

It's often easier to 2 box using separate computer so you don't have
to worry about switching between windows while in the middle of heated
battle.  In the past I've used the main for main character like my 65
Beast while left the secondary to someone like shammy or cleric with
hotkeys set to /g announcing intentions and then casting spell as
needed.  So I'd only need to hit the F key to target the player for
single target spell and then cast the healing spell or target mob and
drop slow and malo spells and send pets out.

It will be hard at first regardless of the 2 boxing methods you use
but after a while it gets easier.  And if you try to 3 box, it's even
more challenging than 2.  Same with 4, 5, even 6 and beyond.  I don't
know if anyone tried to multi-box more than 6 at once.  It'd be a kick
if someone can successfully 18-box their way through the hedge maze.

My brother is a multi-boxing veteran for almost 5 years now and when
he plays just one, he complains a lot because he's not used to it LOL.
He did 6 box once to level a group in Velk's and he hated that.
Mostly he just 2 boxes either SK or monk with his shammy.
