Ah, I see.  Yes, that is handy.

Good point.

Actually, I started (another) mage and I'm having a blast.
I partnered with a low level wizard who used his AE spells
with great effectiveness.

I did, however, rediscover that a dead pet often results in
a dead mage.  Quite a dependency there.  But, therein lies
the balance, I guess.  It helped me find new respect for the
wizard spells Shadow Step and Root.  :)
