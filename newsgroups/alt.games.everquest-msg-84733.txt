Hi

I am trying to figure out why on my new computer, everquest freezes, reading
on the EQ forum people have different things and freeze up so i cant find a
solution.

My computer is, Athlon 1000Mhz, 256MB ram, SB PCI 128 Soundcard

I tried a SB Live in there but it seemed worse so put in the SB PCI 128, I
think its the soundcard but not completely sure, i freeze randomly sometimes
worst than others, also the sound wasnt great and i was choppy, only on the
Eq game this occurs.

My question is what soundcards have other people got that dont freeze? maybe
who has a similar system to me.

I am thinking of getting a cheap Yamaha one, as the game works (thou
incredably slow) on my P2 333 with a Yamaha Soundcard.

Shirl
