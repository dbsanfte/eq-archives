I like the damage on the bows. My level 23 troll warrior with a Darkwood Bow
(cannot remember the name, its the most damaging one), and homemade arrows
(hooked point, bone shaft, Parabolic fletch, small neck), can damage for 28
points, and crit at 56 points. I personally think a 56 dmg to the mob before
it even reach you is a ok damage, and the arrows i use are not even the most
damaging ones, its just the least expensive that have 150 range and some
descent dmg.
