My Barbie Beastlord has gone from 24 to 26.5 so far in Marus.
Solo'ing hoppers and some Stonegrabbers, and grouped on just about
anything in zone.  

My 35th Bard is there as well.  Started there at 33. Solo'ing
toe-to-toe and charm kiting.  

Aweseome zone.  Very rarely crowded (on Rodcet Nife) and getting a
group is usually pretty easy as well.  Lots of Beastlords there, and
we Beastlords do very well in duos or power trios.  =)
