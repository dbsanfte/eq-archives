okay.  First of all, I never said I was being PL'd.
He was there at Oasis, and I was too.  I was chatting with him, while
running around.  It so happens that I got an aggro I couldn't handle, so I
went back to where he was since he'd be able to kill them all in a few
shots.

I'm beginning to feel like I'm the only n00b left in the entire game (or
otherwise this newsgroup).
Everybody else seems to have a wealth of EQ knowledge and loves to wave it
in front of everybody else's faces in a disgusting "I'm better than you"
manner.
This is a newsgroup for the game EverQuest... maybe they should rename it to
"alt.games.lvl.35+.no.noobs.allowed.everquest"
heh


let the flaming commense.
