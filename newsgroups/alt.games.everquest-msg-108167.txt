  If you do decide to buy an LCD, make sure it's a good one... one that
has... oh, I don't know the technical term... but one where the pixels
switch colors fast.  Generally speaking, LCDs aren't as good for gaming as
CRTs.  The problem is that LCDs don't refresh the screen image the same way
as CRTs... CRTs redraw the screen top-to-bottom several times per second...
as long as its refreshing fast enough, then the image looks good (if the
refresh rate is poor, you get a flicker that could cause eye problems and
headaches.)  LCDs work differently... the image doesn't fresh constantly,
only when something on the display changes... the problem is, takes a while
for the pixels to switch colors.  This is bad for a display that is changing
a lot, like 3D games and videos, or scrolling through text.

  Do you have a particular model in mind?  If so, I would recommend trying
it before you buy it.  Go to the store and put it through its paces if you
buy it.  Scroll through a page of text... if you get a blurry effect, that's
bad news.

  Unless you have some compelling reason to buy an LCD, I'd say invest in a
good CRT instead, at least if you use your PC primarily for EQ, other games
or video playback.
