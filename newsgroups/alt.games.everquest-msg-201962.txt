There are too sets im looking in to buying, one is EverQuest: Trilogy
with Classic, The Ruins of Kunark, and The Scars of Velious for $19.99
and the other is EverQuest: Planes of Power with Classic and Planes of
Power for $9.99. It does not say if either come with a play card, I
would rather a play card than have to enter my mothers credit card
number.  I refuse to get my own credit card, they are nothing but
trouble.  I know this is an Everquest newsgroup, but I have heard alot
of EQ players talking about Dark Age of Camelot.  Is that a better
game to get into for a newbie right now since there are not as many
add on packs, its a later game, and EQ2 is about to come out?, which I
hope to get.
