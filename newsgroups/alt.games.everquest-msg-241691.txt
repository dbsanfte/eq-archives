Ah, well, google highlighted one for you, as it tends to do when you link

}What lie that was my first post and I acknowledge that .. I did by
}posting the whole thread.  

Your ability to not make any sense is truly stunning.  The lie here, is 
that you said top posters were flamed to pieces just for top posting in 
this newsgroup.  Hal was not, in fact, flamed to pieces, he was asked 
nicely and politely to change his ways, and you chose to flame the person 
asking nicely and politely.

And, you were flaming Lance Berg.  It was admittedly a mild flame, but of 
all people... Lance is easily one of the top ten nicest and politest 
posters in this group, for the six months a year he's around, right up 
there with Annie and Monual (why is it always the clerics? hmm.)  But he 
is hardly one to be reduced to vitriol and abuse.

Well, now you've gone and done it, I've gone back through the whole dang 
flamewar, and here's what I find:  DT was actually rather polite until the 
flaming had gone on for a couple days, and then stooped so low as to call 
-you- a gimp and a loser, but not for topposting!  No, that was because 
you lied about groups on your list being topposted.  bizbee was abrasive, 
but not massively impolite, amazingly enough.  (at least, judging by the 
quotes X-no-archive leaves behind) He did call you to task to  prove your 
(and Arquvan's) assertion that there were top posting newsgroups.  Perhaps 
you feel being asked to cite is unforgivably rude?  Ben was downright 
nasty to you.  But was he downright nasty to you for  top posting? or even 
defending top posters?  No... Ben's first ire toward you was raised by 
this:

From the shadows, the mysterious "@ndrew" 
<andrewratinternodedotondotnet> (if that IS his real name) 
conspiratorially whispered: 
>No point talking to Biz mate .. he is an anonymous poster ever since I 
>busted him with his feeble attempts on other newsgroups. 

You see?  It's not that you defended top posts, it's that you took a 
gratuitous potshot at bizbee.  And what's more, you made a completely 
non-credible claim that you had in some way 'busted' him, and that his 
attempts were 'feeble'.

So here we have it, @ndrew.  You picked a fight with four popular posters 
over a nonexistent issue, got flamed to bits without particularly abusive 
language, and then moved on to cry about it for three whole months.  I'm 
sure you must be swelling with pride over this.  Congrats!

}You will note a bit further down the thread that Lance and I had a 
}pleasant conversation about the Great Barrier Reef. 

Congratulations.  Perhaps this whole flamewar could have been avoided if 
you'd been polite to Lance in the first place, rather than dredging up 
some ancient grudge against bizbee.

}> You would think.  But you'd be wrong.  If I came to a newsgroup, and

}top posted. 

Naw, we'll just disagree.  You're quite simply wrong.  The first authority 
would be RFC 1822.  That could be overridden if the newsgroup's faq or 
charter specifies it as a top posting newsgroup.  The faq or charter could 
be overridden if the majority of -posters- favored topposting.  I dunno 
how you work things in Oz, but here in America, and most democracies I'm 
familiar with, there's a pretty strict standard of "one man, one vote."  
Not, as you propose, "one man, as many votes as he can stuff in the ballot 
box." 

}No one takes them to task for top posting except the guy who I referred 
}to in my second post.  He is the only one I have seen since I started 
}using NGs and as you have seen he did not get assailed by abusive 
}language ... this is the only group that I visit that does this.

*Shrug* at this point, please prove that -we- do this?  The two examples 
of us doing this that you've pointed to so far, show us being polite 
about correcting topposting, followed by you being an asshole about our 
politeness and calling us all rude, and then us being very rude to you 
indeed for being an asshole.  Which really shouldn't come as much of a 
suprise, should it?

}> Your list of newsgroups was data, that proved not to prove what you 
}>claimed it proved, by your own admission, even.  
}Disagree with that it proved that the majority of posts within the NGs 
}I mentioned were top posted.  That, in fact was how I headed the 
}relevant reply.  (Top posted and bottom posted) 

You're missing at least one comma in there somewhere.  It makes your 
meaning somewhat ambiguous.  Here's some extras: ,,,,,

And you claimed that it proved they were topposting newsgroups.  This was 
shown by others analyzing the data not to be the case.  I really don't 
care how you labelled the post, sticking a label on something doesn't 
change what it is.  A rose by other name, and all that.  Works for turds, 
too. 

}> You mean, like we totally thrashed Hal?  And how we ignored Arquvan's 
}> top posting for at least 16 threads before I got bored of looking? 
}You want me to go to Google again to dig out some Bizbee beauties?

Sure, why not?  Please show me at least one incident of bizbee using 
vitriol and abuse against someone for top posting, before anyone else has 
suggested to that person that top posting might not be such a good idea.

Before you do, though, let me cut you off with a lovely counterexample:
About two years ago, someone named 'fooboy' started a thread screaming 
about how evil it was that people fix topposts so that the rest of the 
world can read them when they quote a topposter.  bizbee supplied most 
of the following post in that thread:  http://tinyurl.com/2bz9m

Now here's the interesting part.  You see right at the top of bizbee's 
part, there?  Where it says:

"bizbee" <tuberoo@ix.netcom.com> wrote in message
> Don't misunderstand me, I find top posting or simply posting with no 
> quote (like they do in some newsgroups, which strikes me as incredibly 
> stupid) to be pretty annoying too, however, I find people who find the 
> need to bitch and argue about it <either> way to be even more 
> annoying.

This little disclaimer should make it clear that bizbee is not, in fact, 
flaming anyone for top posting.  He's flaming people for being pedants and 
complaining about it <either> way!  And, more to the point, he didn't 
single anyone out to flame, did he?  He flamed an attitude he disagreed 
with.  It was left entirely as an exercise for the reader to determine 
whether or not you were, in fact, one of the pedants being discussed. 

Interestingly enough, you participated in this thread, not too much later, 
and provided a perfect example of why some among us grumble about top 
posters and not snipping: http://tinyurl.com/2ywbg

So let's see it, eh?  Where did bizbee dump abuse and vitriol over people 
for top posting?  And why do I doubt that it's far less than the abuse, 
vitriol, and just downright bad manners you've shown over the issue to 
date?

Unless it happens to be a bottom poster, who was clearly being 'caned'.  I 
think perhaps your abuse detectors need a bit of calibration, one way or 
another.  Either that, or you just need to stop contradicting yourself so 
heinously!  Was a bottom poster being caned?  Or is there not a word of 
abuse?  These two things contradict, you know, so unless the physics of 
abuse work vastly differently in your mind, one or the other has to be a 
lie.  You can go ahead and pick which, I really don't care.

}Never miss an opportunity to make others happy, even if you have to

Oh, I see, so you want to ensure the happiness of top posters.  And that, 
I take it, is not defending them in any way.  Interesting.  Amazing how it 
would have helped the happiness of the entire rest of the group if you 
-had- left them alone, but no.  Your advice is for others, not yourself.

You see, this is another place where you've badly contradicted yourself.  
You say you do not remember doing this [defending top posters].  Then, in 
the very same line, you say you said not to abuse top posters and to leave 
them alone.  These two things are a contradiction.  That means that they 
can't both be true at the same time in any logical, rational world.  So 
one of them -must- be false.  You can go ahead and pick which, but either 
way, -you- made a false statement, which could also be termed a lie.  So, 
is the problem that you are a pathological liar, or that you completely 
lack any grasp of logic or reason?  Or perhaps both?  You see, those two 
things do -not- necessarily contradict each other.  That means they could 
both be true at the same time.

You also rely heavily on a strategy of posting one thing, then when 
someone calls you on it, you post a statement that contradicts it, but 
snip the prior comment, and say 'I never said that!', as if we're all far 
too dense to remember what you just posted not 15 minutes before.  The 
number of examples here is far too numerous to be listed.  This isn't just 
a lie, but also a direct insult to our collective intelligence.  You may 
wish to pick a different strategy, like perhaps posting one idea and 
sticking with it?

So which is it, @ndrew?  Pathological lair or complete gonzo bonkers 
nutcase?  Take your pick.  Take both!  They're cheap.
