Not his grave but he's probably rolling around Sigil games office floor
laughing his ass off with Brad and the rest of the original EQ team. The
rumors of huge budget cuts at SoE to support a top heavy management
structure are sounding more and more believable as it looks like not
only are they hiring artists fresh out of school but the ones who
graduated close to the bottom of the class. Or maybe they just hired one
of the overpaid executive's relatives to do the art. I thought the
Kunark player models were amaturish but the new splash screen art makes
that stuff brilliant in comparison.

On the other hand, most of the new monster models aren't too bad, so I
guess the layoffs in that part of their art department hasn't cut too
deep yet.

Next expansion they'll probably outsource the art to one of the former
Soviet countries, that seems to be another trend in game companies
lately.
