I'm going to PL a rogue up to 39 ( spending the last 10 or so levels in 
Nurga / Droga ) so that we'll have a non-KoS rogue for Chardok.

I spent a couple hours in Pal and got a rogue from 1-22, then headed off to 
MSeru and got a couple more levels ( I think he's 24 now ).

What I've been doing is keeping Berserker Spirit, Feedback, Insight and 
Haste on the rogue and let the mobs die from the DS.

The Chanter DS sucks, 11 points.  These Luclin mobs have a ton of HPs.

I'm looking for a better place and way to get this Rogue up in level, but I 
don't have a healing class to PL with.

I'm thinking about Sol A.  I think I'll also start rooting the mob after it 
gets down to about 45% life and making it take a whack at me and have my 
animation jump in and finish it off.

I can also try the method of letting my pet do most of the work then 
mezzing and blurring if my pet will be nice enough to stop attacking.

Any suggestions on how to use my 56 Chanter to PL this guy are appreciated.

Also, he's wielding an 11/22 piercer.  What are some upgrades to this that 
cost under 2k?  Someone told me a Fungusbeast Spine ( something like that 
), but none are for sale.  We may give the Fungus Caller quest another shot 
soon - I think it drops there.

Side note:  The Rogue has been tanking for 24 or so levels and his Defense 
is horrible - in the teens I think.
