The word you are looking for is Rampant, I think.

And its not kill stealing to grab a named that hasn't been engaged, the 
crime you are accusing them of is Leapfrogging, which I'm afraid isn't 
against SOE rules at all; you might have a shot at getting them in 
trouble for actual KSing if you could prove it *

Grage

* usually only by having a GM witness the act, which means someone 
popping in and taking a named you've engaged, then leaving, is probably 
completely safe against reprisal, as the odds of your getting a GM in to 
observe before they've done anything to you are pretty low.
