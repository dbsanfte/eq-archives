It generally comes down to respecting peoples camps....

If you get to a camp and see a group of people of the right level sat down,
its pretty damn obvious they are medding/recovering for the next pull.

Each server and zone generally have their own "player rules", e.g Sebilis =
respected camps, Velk = FCFS.. and whilst you may think players have no
right to set "rules", remember player rules help prevent a lot of the shit
you see in EQ (i.e rotations, planes calendars).. so sure you don't HAVE to
follow the rules, but your going against the community by doing so... and by
doing so your being an asshole  (there are exceptions.. and the game does
kinda change at 35+ or so... and drastically at 51+)
