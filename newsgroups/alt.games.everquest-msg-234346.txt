You are talking pretty old cards that are not "compliant." They don't
have to support DX9 in hardware, they just have to work with it. If
you have anything around a geforce 2 MX or newer, you'd have no
problems. Heck, my old TNT 16 meg might even work still since Nvidia
uses a unified driver for all cards.

Basically it would probably affect the four people using Voodoos
still, or old S3 cards or whatever. The people who won't spring for
the 30 bucks to get a brand new geforce MX or some discount ATI card.
