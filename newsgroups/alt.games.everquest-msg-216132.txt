If it takes 10% of your mana bar to finish a fight, you med back 5% and there's another
fight, then it isn't a question of someone's mind being slow, its simple math.  20 kills
and the healer is OOM.  You can't keep that up forever.  Can't.  Doesn't happen.
Because 5+5+5+5...+5=20.  This isn't a religious belief, its simple mathematics.  It
doesn't matter if those fights are 1 mob at a time or 10 mobs at a time, the only thing,
ONLY thing, that matters, is mana used minus mana regenerated.  Thats it.  All the
wishful thinking in the world don't change that.

If you are adjusting your pull pace once the healer gets down to 30%, so you can keep
him there forever, why the hell didn't you adjust it back at 80%?  What benefit is there
to you to keeping him LOM constantly?  That might make sense if you are breaking a camp
initially, or if you are trying to get somewhere in order to take down a named... but if
you know you are going to have to keep things up for an hour, really what difference
does a few more kills in the first few minutes (before you slow down) make?

Your plan is "kill till we get me down to 30% mana, then med exactly like Bergh
suggested, back up to 30% (which is the same time Bergh is putting in)"   Pressed to
explain yourself, you'll say "That way the first couple kills are faster, the rest of
the run is exactly the same, except when something goes wrong, I'll run OOM right away."

Am I right?

I've won every LDoN run I've been in, which is admittedly only two.  My cleric is level
65, and has won countless battles, dungeon crawls, camps, solo camps, AE camps, raids;
I've also run a shaman to 51, a druid to 34, a bard to 57, a warrior to 30, an enchanter
to 30, and currently am playing around with a mage who's 36 at the moment.  I have
killed a few things in my day.  I know the difference between "30% mana, go ahead and
pull" and "80% go ahead and pull".

No, its not. But the difference between 20% and 21% is well within the normal variation;
get a mob that gets lucky with a few resists, or hits for max damage a few times in a
row... boom, you use more mana than you thought you might.  Get an add, puller gets more
than he meant to, someone accidentally (or thru stupidity) opens a crate and gets a
surprise... anything that changes the odds the slightest bit against you, and the party
that pulls with the healer LOM is the dead party, the party with a healer with lots of
mana available is alive at the end and bitching about having to med to get back to
readiness.

Its not rocket science to say that 20% mana when you NEED 21% means you die, the girl
dies, everybody dies.  Cause this isn't government economics either, where you can run a
deficit and claim its profit; if you get to 0% and need one more %, well its not there.
Sorry.  Perhaps you'd like to play Voodoo Economics instead.

Pulling mobs when the group is barely capable of handling a perfect pull with no
surprises is a mistake; another way of saying this is "don't bet the rent" or "There
aint no such thing as a sure thing".

What I mean is that mobs do get runs of good luck, hitting for full damage 4 or 8 times
in a row, doing twice their expected damage output.  They also get lucky on resists,
resisting several slows in a row, taking almost no damage from a series of heavy nukes.
Here's another bumper sticker for you, "Shit happens".  If your plan is "everything will
go well, no need to be ready for problems" then you are saying any time something
unexpected does happen, group wipes.  Not much of a plan.  Especially since there's no
reason for it I can fathom.  Once again, anyone capable of staying at 30% mana is
equally capable of staying at 80% mana.  If your pull pace is taking the 30% guy down to
25%, 20%, 15%... well then you can't keep going.  And if he's staying at 30%, then what
difference would it make to you if he stayed at 80% instead?  He'll be spending the same
amount of mana and regenning it back either way.

Only two differences.  One, going to 30% lets you pull at a faster pace than he can
regen the mana for a while... but then you have to slow down to his regen pace once you
get to 30% anyway.  Two, when something goes wrong, healer only has 30% mana instead of
80%.  Was it worth the extra 3 mobs you killed just after entering the dungeon?

OK, at higher levels there is a AE version, but the AE part is quite small, I rarely
found occaision to use it at all.  Bards don't get one, enchanters and clerics get it
but don't use it much, and paladins don't get it at all.  So for all intents and
purposes, the line is single target.  Oh, rangers and druids get a good AE version, but
all LDoN dungeons are indoors, where they can't use it, and its level limited.

Ah, but melee attacking is a "good thing" while clerics and enchanters spending their
precious little down time as pullers is a "bad thing".  You'll have to draw a better
parallel; say for example "going invis requires killing your pet".  See the difference?
My example paired a good thing with a bad thing, yours just suggested a good thing with
no consequences.

Used it a few times in the bad old days when it was resisted 75% of the time and pulled
mobs every single time without fail.  Used it a good deal more (but far from regularly,
since its better to have someone pull that isn't in need of mana) after the patch that
fixed it.  Its resisted about 20% of the time, and pulls like you nuked the mob if it
fails about 25% of the time.  These numbers change based on the level of the mob
relative to the caster, and supposedly on the charisma of the caster.  It doesn't
utterly suck the way it once did... but yes, a real failure means gang rape time.    If
you have a different view, you might get a better response stating it rather than simply
chuckling to yourself like a drooling looney.

Hah, no.  Low level (for the group) Mage who knows the area goes out, gets mob or mobs
to order, comes back, uses pet to peel the mobs off himself, then runs off to get the
next mob.  Constant pull, always one and only one mob engaged, most of the mage's damage
output remains (because its coming from the pet), nobody in the group other than the
mage is ever not either attacking, casting, or medding, yet no mana is wasted on mezzes
or roots.  Mind you anyone with a SOW on could pull just as well if he knew the area
well... but melee classes and healers both contribute more to the fight than the mage
does; the mage tends to keep his mana bar full in case of overpulls or other disasters,
and relys on pet to do most of the damage.

Anyway, the mage was a wild example, you attack it as though its my main point; my point
is that sometimes a monk is a better puller than a cleric; its situational.

Since all my information was essentially correct (yes, there were some fine hairs to be
split, but nothing important or relevant) I suppose the converse is true, that you are
now insulted?  Wouldn't make any sense, there's no insult involved, there's either right
or wrong.  Show me where healers magically double their mana regen when they get to 30%
mana, like warriors get a boost to str when their HP drops to a certain percentage, and
I'll apologize.  But thats what I'm looking for, some game mechanic that makes my theory
that 80% is exactly like 30% except that you have mana in case of disaster wrong.

OK, you risk losing face, we risk losing face AND our lives, our experience, our buffs.
I retract "no risk" and substitute "minimal risk".  If you promise to stand back up and
let the mobs kill you every time you wipe a group by pulling when the healer said LOM
hold pulls, I'll even retract that.  But at the moment, you don't share the risk equally
with the people whose request for a safer work environment you are denying.

And you aren't winning anything by keeping the group at 30% instead of at 80% unless you
find yourself down to the wire with only a couple minutes to go.  Heck, even then, the
group with 80% near the end of the mission can go flat out and blow thru 5 mobs fast
just like the 30% group did at the beginning of the mission, so the total time expended
(and the mana remaining at mission end) is the same... but the group that was at 80%
most of the mission was ready in case of disasters.  The 30% group was lucky, the 80%
group was prepared, both got to the finish line at the same time... unless of course the
30% group wiped.

Seriously, instead of playing around with the fiddling details of this or that, do me a
favor, focus on this main point.  How and why is 30% better than 80%?
