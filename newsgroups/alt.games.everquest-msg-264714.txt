With all due respect to Intel, the current generation of Pentium 4's
stink.  They chose to let marketing make some engineering choices for
them.  As a result, they pumped up the GHz in order to sell new CPUs
to people who still believe in the "MHz Myth" (which I guess you could
now call the "GHz Myth").

That's the reason Intel's main competitors, the IBM PowerPC and AMD
Athlon 64, perform much better than Pentium 4's at similar clock
speeds.  Intel and AMD chose a smarter engineering path: don't chase
high clock speeds just to sell CPUs.

The Pentium M is different -- smarter -- technology than the Pentium
4.  While the current generation of Pentium 4's have terrible heat
problems, the Pentium M runs reasonly cool.  That is important to most
laptop users.

The Pentium M also uses much less power.  That is also important to
most laptop users.

If you're buying a laptop for games, games, games, and oh yes, some
applications, and you insist on a laptop form factor, then sure, one
of those "desktop replacement"-style laptops may be a good choice for
you, and those are based on Pentium 4's.

But for most people, the Pentium M is easily the far superior choice.
They perform much better than their clock speed would lead most
uninformed people to believe, and they're properly designed for the
laptop form factor.
