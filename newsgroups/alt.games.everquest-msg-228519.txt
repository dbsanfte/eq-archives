    People who raid more are getting more loot than people who do not?
*GASP* Stop the presses!

    If mob availability isn't an issue, and you've indicated it isn't,
there's nothing wrong with this. They raid more, they get more stuff, they
can be pickier about what they ask for in the joint raids. No different than
people in the org who raid more than others in the org - they get more
points, they get upgrades faster, they can be pickier about what they take.
If I were involved with the guild that raids more, and the org declared it
was going to take over our private raids, I'd ask my guild to consider
simply dropping out of the org as they're holding us back. They can't raid
as much as us? Slackers!
