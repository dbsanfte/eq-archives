Try a few things at once.
Collect bat wings and bone chips and spiderling and spider silks and hides
Greater Fay
Butcher block are ok for this
I think East commanlands are best. Collect and auction.( bat wings don't
sell here. Vender in zone)

Any way by trying to auction stacks of bat wings and bone chips and silk
swatches and leather padding you will have better odds of finding a buyer.

Also don't sweat not buying every spell.
Get the most needed few spells and level and collect stuff to sell.
lvl 12 16 you may want to start getting every spell but still not a big
deal.
Bone chip stacks sell from 1 to 6pp a stack
Silk swatches 20 to 60pp a stack
HQ bear 15 to 30pp each
HQ cat 2 to 5pp each
HQ wolf and MQ LQ hides convert to leather padding.
Stacks of padding from 20 to 80 pp.
