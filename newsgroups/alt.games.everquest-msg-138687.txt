EverQuest is self-contained within its own folder. You can copy the
folder to CD or another volume, then copy it back after you reformat
your hard drive.

If you're changing operating systems, however, EverQuest may be
caching information about your video card and drivers. Different OS
means different drivers. This information will usually be kept in
specific files that you can delete and EverQuest will rebuild for you
if it doesn't find them.
