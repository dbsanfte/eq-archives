   Ok, where ever we stand on the the "Ding" issue, I think
we can all agree that this is just bizarre.  
   I think it's sorta dumb for people to shout out "Ding". 
I never do.  I will tell my group if I ding, if everyone is
very focused on how much exp we are getting and how everyone
is progressing.  OTOH, I do reply to the "Ding"er's with a
hotkey that /ooc's "Grats on ding.  I knew you could do
it!"  I hope that the gentle sarcasm of a complete stranger
claiming that they "knew you could do it" will sink in and
cure them of this need for recognition.  It does seem to
work on some level too... they realize its a canned reply,
not sincere, and therefore meaningless praise for a
meaningless self promotion.
   Still, I've had one guy come up to me and tell me that "I
remember you!  I shouted "Ding" once when I just started
playing, and you told me you knew I could do it!  Thanks for
the encouragement, it really meant something to me."  I just
/smiled at him, and didn't tell him I meant it
sarcastically.
    Oh, I don't have that hotkeyed on the FV server.  I do
try to roleplay there, and acknowledging what is clearly a
/ooc statement would be wrong, IMHO.
