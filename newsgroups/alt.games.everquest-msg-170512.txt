> Yeah, but the loot blows serious goat scrotum.

I don't know, at 15 in Norrath I hunted in High Hold Pass and the chainmail
that drops nets out about the same as the Recondite stuff.  I think more
Recondite pieces drop too, and they sell for 2-5 pp ea. Not bad loot for
15-25 level.

Moving on from there Luclin is pretty crappy.   Netherbian, M Seru and
Dawnshroud, the most popular spots. have really bad loot.  Some of the drops
sell well to other players, but there is nothing that nets good cash from
vendors.
