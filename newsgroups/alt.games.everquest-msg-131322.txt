I suppose so.  I haven't done anything like this before, so I'm a little 
hazy on how it works.  All I know is I'm sick of this:

/say I'm so bored I'm playing gems. Yeesh.
Groupmember_01 says "I have a second monitor. I'm viewing high elf porn 
right now. Heh heh."

(You get the idea)

I have WinXP.  That would be the upgrade that has *recently* broken me, 
as compared to the future upgrades that I plan on breaking me again :)  
Any way to tell if your current card supports such ideas?  (Or to find 
out what that card is? /me hangs her head in shame)

Not much.  Look up stuff in Allakhazams so I don't get scammed in EC so 
much.  Read an online book while I'm camping something.  Type a letter 
to a friend while I'm waiting for a spot in a group to open up (HHK 
needs to be about, oh, 7 times as big)

> Are these some of the things you'd like to do?

Well... yes? *g*
