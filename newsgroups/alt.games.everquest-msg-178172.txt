I use two through cable connection to a broadband router (dlink 604i).
I considered wireless but didn't go with it for 2 main reasons:

- compared to traditional wiring method, it was much more expensive
(router was only 80Cdn)
- the computers were in the same room and wiring a patch cord was very
easy.

I may have pursued wireless if I had great distances or obstacles to
traverse.
