First up, KEI and FT10 (assuming you're giving that to the druid) work
during the kite, plus throw in PotG for good measure and you've saved a
slice of med time, right?

Hmmm... interested on how you come up with 70dps. Never really paid much
attention to parsing. A really old version of Copelands I dug up and put
in Hategiver/Bloodfrenzy, and got 2001dpm, or 33dps, boosted to 35dps if
I swap hategiver with manawhip (assuming zero MR mobs), using CoF haste
(shuddup!) Could you cite where you came up with a value of 70dps for a
non-hasted warrior please?

I don't go by people's bragging of vague terms like 'good' or 'bad'
experience. I go by wizzies, mages and the like claiming 8 blue AAXP
bars per hour soloing. 

Excellent exp? Easily in groups? A warrior in a group is a DRAIN on exp,
just like a cleric, in all but the toughest areas such as 2nd floor srra
and deep CT. Replace him with a monk, sk, or several other classes, and
the group's rate of exp on plentiful mid/low blues just increased
considerably. A druid in a mageless group can add a huge amount of
damage from DS alone. Throw in regen and PotG, together with snare, DoTs
and DDs and a few rightclicks, and druids increase exp rate on pure exp-
farming groups far more than a warrior can.

The only place a warrior shines is in a deep dungeon, high risk group,
or on a raid. And on a raid, only a couple of warriors are needed for
all but total disasters, and the rest are better replaced by someone who
actually does damage.
