Your entitled to your opinion, but I disagree.

Battlefield Earth could have been much much better than it was.

However it was too comic & corny to play as an epic like LotR. Don't get 
me wrong it was a fun read, but there was too much humour (some 
deliberate) in it to try and play it straight. From Johnny "Goodboy"
Tyler's name to portraying intersteller bankers as shark-men...

If they played it as a light space-fantansy it could work, and even be 
very good, something stylistically on par with 'The Fifth Element'

But then it would lack the intensity of LotR.
