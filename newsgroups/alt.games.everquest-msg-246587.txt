It won't with the new expansion, if the rumours about it being the
final DX9 implementation are correct ... it will actually run but a bit
like a wet sponge.

See above.

This will have big problems running at all.  This card cannot implement
vertex shaders let alone the other DX9 eye candy.  He will have to buy
a new card after the new expansion comes in.

This won't help any of the current Nvidia cards .. wrong implementation
of DX9 cannot be fixed by talk .. or in this case drivers.  They messed
up but it looks like they may, and I repeat may because it is
vapourware and not on the shelves yet, have fixed it with their latest
card.

And good luck running the new DX9 implementation at anything greater
than 10 fps with the current crop of Nvidia cards.  The funniest thing
of the lot is that SOE have setup a deal to offer discount Nvidia cards
to customers ... smacks of a death wish for the game.

I posted recently on the Berserker boards about the silly decision of
SOE to implement DX9 with this game.  All those with Nvidia cards that
purport to implement DX9 will have major problems.  Those with older
cards (Nvidia or Radeon) will be lagged to hell and back.  Bad decision
and compounds a bad decision to release the next expansion to keep
players.
