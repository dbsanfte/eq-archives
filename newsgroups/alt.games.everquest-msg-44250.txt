> Copy from my history page on our website:
>
> Found by a childless dwarven couple Rhand was raised by dwarfs. His
> childhood was harsh for he outgrew his playmates in a few years. Toying with
> magics unknown to other dwarfs he became an outcast, yet still loved by the
> small mountain community.
>
> In a dark period his town-cave was raided by goblins. To help with whatever
> he could, Rhand summoned a fiery defender to protect his town.
>
> The raiders were defeated succesfully, but Rhand's inexperience and lack of
> tutorship made him lose control of the awesome elemental. Instead of
> returning whence it came from it released havoc on the town itself, killing
> both Rhand's adoption-parents as well as half of the survivors of the raid.
>
> Vowing to become a master of his powers and defeating evil in the lands
> Rhand left his home town.
>
> After many ferocious battles a noble paladin approached Rhand and invited
> him to join his noble cause. Palli, the name of the Paladin, was leader of
> the guild named Destiny's Shadow.
>
> After a few good years the guild broke apart in a time of great turmoil.
> Rhand took over leadership and pieced the remnants together to forge an ever
> stronger guild.
