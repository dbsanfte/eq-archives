I don't know why people are kicking up such a fuss about the frogs levels.

The same high exp ZEM bonuses apply to everybody, anybody can go to places
like Paladual and make insane levels.

Look at the assling- I fired him up about midnight, geared him, took him to
Paladual, by the time I logged at 1am he was level 25ish.

As for the epic...  whether that character did the work or not, every step
of the epic was still done.  Im sure they did the quest themselves on their
main, and just MQ'd it for the frog at the end.  But like I said,
regardless, the amt of work required for the epic was just as much as any
other cleric that ever made the epic.
