	And the opportunity to play.  Which was mostly what you lost in UO, since
equipment was cheap.

|Who said PvE was vapid? It's no more Vapid then it is in EQ.

	It is vapid because it is a secondary (at best) part of the game, intended
only to level you up for PvP.  This has been one of the most widely-made
observations on web sites; even the guys at Lum/SND said so and they're pretty
firmly on the pro-PvP team.

|Yes it's
|a new product and doesn't have 2 years of retail dev time into it but
|the devs have said they would expand both RvR and PvE aspects of the
|game. 

	They can SAY whatever they like.  What they DO will be another story.

	Their mouths are writing checks their asses can't cash.  Providing as much
ongoing PvE content as, say, EQ does (which is not a lot) would break their
development budget because they'd have to do three times as much work just to
keep up.  That is assuming, by the way, that all this content goes into the
"safe" areas.  It will not.  Much of their supposed future PvE content will go
into the PvP sections of the game.  Mythic will invoke the "risk versus
reward" canard and argue that content in the PvP areas has to be better than
content in the safe areas because PvP players risk more.

	Add to the fact that it says right here on the label that PvP is the
ultimate goal of the game, and I don't think I'm out of line being sceptical
about future PvE content.

|The first expansion is due in the spring which features the
|newer net immerse engine adaptation  and more textures  skins and mob
|models. 

	So they have a graphics update due in six months -- that's nice.  Graphics
are the least important part of the game.

|Then they will be quadrupled. Or Octupled.  The Home realms will not
|be invaded by pkers.

	*Of course* they will!  Just SAYING they won't is like waving a red flag
at a bull!

|Mythic has stated that should it happen the way it happened will be found and fixed. 

	And then a new way will be found, and they'll try to plug that, and then
another new way, and another attempt to stop it, and so on, with the
developers being one step behind the players the whole time, JUST LIKE THE UO,
EQ AND AC DEVELOPERS HAVE BEEN FOR YEARS.

	My prediction is that Mythic will either end up a) throwing their hands in
the air and telling everyone that "securing your realm's borders is part of
the game", or b) turning off PvP entirely in home realms.  The fact that they
have not already done the latter should be sufficient to indicate that they
intend for PKs to be able to penetrate into home realms.  They just want it to
be "difficult" -- which it won't be.

|Hmm actually no a Pker gets his rocks of on the frustration of his
|prey. 

	Sorry, but no.  I am speaking from experience.  The vast majority of PKs I
encountered in UO did not speak at all.  They simply killed.  You are talking
about a very small minority of PKs here -- the real griefers, the ones who
deliberately set out to make someone else miserable.  To people such as
myself, though, non-consensual PvP IS grief play -- and I don't accept the
premise that walking outside some supposed "safe" area counts as consent.

|course that can't happen in Daoc nor can pking, since the only place
|PvP occurs is in the frontiers which you have to voluntarily go to. 

	Even if that were true -- which it is not, since as noted above there is
no geographical hard PvP protection -- think about it.  It's bad enough that a
DAoC player only gets to see a third of the game.  If he doesn't want to be
PKed, he's supposed to limit himself even further?

	Bottom line is that DAoC is a PvP game.  People who have played it say so,
the company even says so.  Every comment I have seen from its imps indicates
that in DAoC, PvP *IS* the endgame.  Arguing that it is viable as a PvE-only
game is willful ignorance at best.

	Syl, you gushed like this about EQ when it was new, too -- don't make me
go to Google and prove it.  It didn't take long for your tune to change, and
I'm guessing it won't take long before you start kvetching about DAoC too.  Do
not kid yourself, and don't try to kid me.  Sooner or later, the honeymoon
will end; people will start to discover DAoC's limitations, they'll start
asking the imps for things the imps can't do, and the imps will eventually
have to beat down imbalances with Abashi's Rod of Disempowerment.  If you like
the game, fine, but please -- it's not the Promised Land.
