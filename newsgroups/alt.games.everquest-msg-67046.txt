Actually, yes, I played on Lanys. But I seem to remember you saying
that you didn't movelog, and that's why I asked. I think I saw you
once on Lanys, in North Freeport, but I can't really be sure. That
was before I knew of you in the newsgroup, and I noticed yet another
dark elf named Do'urden, heh.

Anyway, my main's a high elf cleric named Filina, and my alt's
Kagrab the troll warrior. Say Hi if you see em running round!

Hehe, I've been stalking you! No, no, it's just that I'm fairly
sure you posted that you didn't movelog, in a thread about
movelogs.
