I've had a full raid (72) of well geared people fail on Grummus due to
poor strategy - Grummus running around your raid playing tag the
healer can lead to quite an entertaining wipe - spoilers are probably
of more value than firepower though I'm guessing a minimum of 50-60
would be needed to win.

TT is IMO more straightforward than Grummus though again spoilers win
the day, she's quite the wimp with her secrets laid bare.  As close to
a full raid as possible to guarantee the win though, a minimum of 60
I'd imagine with the gear listed above.  Set aside at least 45 minutes
for people getting themselves killed crossing PoN, training xp Hedge
groups, getting lost and running slap bang into the guardians etc etc.
