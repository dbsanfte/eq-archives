Obviously you spent a great deal of time searching high and low.  At
www.eqtraders.com, click on Recipes, then click on Tailoring, scroll down a
bit to the section on armor recipes, and guess what you will find.

Personally though, I would go to www.lokari.net for any tailoring info, it's
much better organized in my opinion, but it is strictly for tailoring, no
other tradeskills.
