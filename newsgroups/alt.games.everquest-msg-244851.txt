Hello All,

I have a 55th Level Paladin, and it seems to me that the time has come 
to upgrade his weapons.

He uses 2HS,1HS and 1HB weapons.

Currently he has the following weapons :

Sword Of the Morning:
1HS Dly=27,Dmg=16,Bns = 9
Proc = Tishan's Clash (stun)

Ghoulbane:
1HS Dly=34, Dmg=15, Bns=9
Proc = Dismiss Undead (DD)

Weighty Polearm:
2HS Dly=34, Dmg=29,Bns=16

Mace Of the Fallen Crusader:
1HB Dly=25, Dmg=21,Bns=9

Delightful Orb Of Forgotten Magic:
1HB Dly=30,Dmg=16,Bns=9
Proc = Ice Shock (DD)


I have 40K available from my trading mule

Any suggestions and advice is most welcome.


Thanks
