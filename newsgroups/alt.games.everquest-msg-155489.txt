1. Zoning with your pet was a gimmick. You still had to re-buff. It
was fun to be different, but having an unbuffed pet enter the zone
with you gets annoying after a while. When I am crossing big zones I
don't bother to SoW my now unbuffed warder (it's a waste of mana, he
will lose the SoW the next time I zone anyway). I just run ahead of it
and ignore it until I get to my destination.

2. The warder "Icon" uses a buff slot limiting BLs to only 14 buffs on
a raid (out of 15 total possible)

3. The warder "Icon" (and warder itself) faded after @5 hours. If you
didn't remember to resummon a new warder before the time limit expired
your pet could go "poof" in the middle of battle with no warning.

4. The pet level buff takes a LOT of mana to cast. Add on the level 39
haste buff, SoW, Pet Process, and a stat buff or two, and you can
waste almost a whole mana bar just prepping for battle after zoning.
As long as the "CH bug" existed, Verant would never lower the mana
costs. Now that the bug is eliminated I am hoping that VI will lower
the mana requirements to setup a pet to be more in line with Necros
and Mages.

I am VERY happy with the changes! Now that our warders are coded like
the other pets, BLs will hopefully get upgrades at the same time as
Necros and Mages, instead of waiting for months.
