Spend an hour or so killing fire beetles and spiderlings.  I think you can
get 7 silver or so per eye and the vendors are right in the hunting ground
so you don't have to log into rivervale to sell.  Kill bats too.  A stack of
20 bat wings will get you a couple plat from most magic users with levitate.
After you get your spells (you need pretty much all of the level 5 spells
except for ward summoned) go past the wall in Misty Thicket and turn left.
Go up the hill and kill large bats...giant bats... and wasps.  I stayed
there until 9 then bought my new spells and was off to East Commonlands and
the orcs.
