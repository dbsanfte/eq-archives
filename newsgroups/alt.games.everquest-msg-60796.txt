First point of advice - get groups.  Surely it isn't that hard to get a
group?  Groups will teach you a lot more about your class, and are a lot of
fun.  Plus generally you will get more exp, which means you get to the
higher levels where you can start doing more things such as exploring etc.
Generally the higher in level you go, the better it gets, although as I say
below your enjoyment is really dependent upon yourself.

Butcherblock mountains is not quite so bad as this.  20feet into zone?  Far
out, generally the brownies are rarely there (basically there habitat is the
upper-west part of the zone) - perhaps they were trained?  But then, even if
not it is something I suppose that is the risk in this world.  I mean, sure
corpse runs are not that enjoyable at the time, but I look back over my
journeys and deaths and corpse runs and so on, and it has not only taught me
a lot, given me better tactics, helped me respect mobs :-), and added a
challenge - but it I believe has also given me an experience that though can
be frustrating at the time, is all a part of the game and having fun, it is
experience.

Ummmm, no cleric guild in Greater Faydark, the quest giver is in Felwithe
:-).

One thing you will find is that not all the quests are that good - in fact a
lot of them aren't.  This is one aspect that I suppose EQ fails in, but
there are still quite a few out there that are good.  Yeah, I suppose if you
want to you can be like the early beta testers etc. who found these quests
for us by hailing every NPC you come across.  But a lot of quests are quite
well covered if not at one site then at another.

I suppose there were some aspects of the game that disappointed me when I
first started too, but then I realised - "Hey, it isn't MY game - I didn't
design it, so why should it be exactly how I think it should be?"  Now while
I still am disappointed at a lot of things in it (and not in it), I am also
aware that basically my enjoyment really comes down to me creating it for
myself.

So in conclusion - just play it and enjoy yourself - if you find you can't
then I suppose it isn't the game for you.  But I find that unless you are
willing to I suppose 'find the fun' in the game yourself, then there aren't
too many games that will please you.
