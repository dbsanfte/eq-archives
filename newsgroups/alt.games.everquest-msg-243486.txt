It has nothing to do with DX9, this is the new collision detection
code, you know the one that put superglue onto most non-horizontal
surfaces.  The only relation to the new graphics engine is that it
uses the same code as the server for figuring out if you've collided
with something, whereas before apparently the code was different
between server and client.
