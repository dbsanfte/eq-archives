Barbs do have nice stats, especially for the classes you can play
them.  If barbs had an INT caster, or if at EQ's launch there had been
a shaman race with higher starting WIS, they might not be considered
as good.  They also have fairly good faction with most races,
especially compared to the other original shaman races.  Faction also
used to be a bigger deal back at launch than it is now, considerably
bigger.

Don't discount Slam either.  That's been a nice perk more than a few
times for my barb warrior.  My shorty warrior levelling up has run
into plenty of fights where a reliable spell interruption method would
have come in handy.

Halflings got the experience bonus because they're ass ugly.
