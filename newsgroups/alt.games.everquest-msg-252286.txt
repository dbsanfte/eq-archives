Doh. Yup, I've managed to miss that one. Saw the movie, didn't care for 
it... but I'm not going to hold that against Heinein. :)

Surely you aren't suggesting this responsibility developed while he was 
blitzed on heroin?

Ah so the junkie developed his social responsibility before becoming a 
junkie. Too bad poking himself with the needle turns it off for a while, 
prevents any further development, and may damage whats already there.

Hmmm... interesting. What if that unconsious person on the sidewalk 
turns out to be the homeless drunkard? Were we just Lucky the lost child 
found him before he'd begged enough quarters to put him back to sleep on 
the sidewalk? And you call that social responsibility?

You are right the yuppie is scum, and you are right being conscious 
doesn't imply social responsibily, but it is nessary start.

> Teach them to fish first, then let them have their drugs if they want them.

Ok... but if they have the higher virtues we are alledging then they'll 
choose not to take them. I can live with legalized drugs if society 
knows better than to take them. But it doesn't yet, and it hasn't 
learned to fish... its not ready for drugs.
