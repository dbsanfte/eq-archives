I don't know how viable the group would be in any adventure, but yesterday
in N Ro my group did three mass kills (from 50 to 57 mobs each).
The staff was: 53 Cleric, 51 Enchanter, 3 wizards (52.53.55) and Ranger 56.
Of course we had KEI, but as to HP buffage -- HB (not even Temperance). Did
we wipe? Yes, on the first mission. But we actually had time to go to pok,
re-kei, come back and finish (first one was kill 50). And then it really
went down to farming level, esp since plat was just raining on us (never had
plat drop so well, but only 5-6 augs in 3 missions). This was my first and
only caster group, so that may never repeat again.

Sinfein,
the Enchanter
