When you have prayed for victory you have prayed for many unmentioned results
which follow victory � must follow it, cannot help but follow it. Upon the
listening spirit of God the Father fell also the unspoken part of the prayer. He
commandeth me to put it into words. Listen!

"O Lord our Father, our young patriots, idols of our hearts, go forth to battle
� be Thou near them! With them � in spirit � we also go forth from the sweet
peace of our beloved firesides to smite the foe. O Lord our God, help us to tear
their soldiers to bloody shreds with our shells; help us to cover their smiling
fields with the pale forms of their patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder
of the guns with shrieks of their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay
waste their humble homes with hurricanes of fire; help us to wring the hearts of
their unoffending widows with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out
roofless with their little children to wander unfriended the wastes of their
desolated land in rags and hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames of summer
and the icy winds of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee
for the refuge of the grave and denied it � for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord,
blast their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make
heavy their steps, water their way with tears, stain the white snow with the
blood of their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the
Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that are
sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen."
