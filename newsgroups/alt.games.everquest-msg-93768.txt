Not if you don't already have cov faction. If you have cov faction and
its allied.. or fairly high, it takes a long time to lower it. If it
is allied you probably got it that way in kael and going back to kael
would keep it there even if you killed skyshrine mobs or the
occasional velious dragon.

I only dropped from allied to amiable recently on claws of veeshan
because my guild killed two of the named dragons in Temple of veeshan
which are on claws faction. They must give a pretty big hit.
