The and change works out to about 5gp.  Add in about 1 on 20 failures to
that, makes the cost 57.75pp.  So, 60pp is a very reasonable price for
friends and guildmates.  I sell them for 55pp to friends and guildmates, the
under 2pp loss is not enough to make any difference, as I don't get too many
requests for them anyway.  When I sell them to others, I usually charge 90
to 100pp, depending on what others who are selling are charging.  I don't
sell them for less than that, it's just not worth my time.  I could go kill
a HG and get about the same amount of cash.
