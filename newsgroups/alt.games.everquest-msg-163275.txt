Yeah, the chanter said he didn't even get a tash off before he was road
pizza.  Turns out that not everyone moved when the call was given.  Just
found out about that part.  I didn't have time to look for myself, because I
did move, so it was a relatively quick and painless death for me.

Hmm, I think we were past that area, I guess almost to the King.  It was on
the ramp down that we got eaten.

I think it would have helped to have a rogue for that.  Would have given us
the luxory of allowing the puller to die, and then dragging his perverted
ass back out.  Oh, did I mention our SK puller is also a necrophiliac?

> So I think the MA wasn't your problem. Your support crew was.

Most likely.  Thanks for the analysis, tho.  Helps to be able to see where
we can improve.
