Can't really say. No one that I know in our guild has done it lately.
(If they had, I'm sure they would have been complaining in chat channel
on the long wait. :P)

All I can remember is that the orc pawn with a torch has to be killed,
then you go to that spot and kill the pawns as they spawn, as they're
the placeholders for Faelin. I seem to recall 4 or 5 hours for her to
spawn for me.
