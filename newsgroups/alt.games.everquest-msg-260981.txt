I had a similar experience to the original poster.  Was a frustrating start due
to logging in and being in BB I thought I'd be able to get a task right away
there.  I used find and it led me directly to taskmaster in BB who, when
hailed, completely ignored me.  I still don't know if this is because of my
level(42), or some faction thing(I'm ERU Necro) but they wouldn't talk to me. 
Eventually decided to try PoK.  Got a taskmaster there to talk to me who just
gave me the locations of other taskmasters to talk to, one of which was BB. 
Decided I didn't want to go back there and be ignored again so I ran to the one
in OT.
     He gave me a task to first off speak to someone in EJ.  As soon as I zoned
into EJ I got the LDoN style compass mark and was led directly to the NPC. 
This NPC sent me to City of Mist to kill 10 plaguebone skeletons.  Not being
very familiar with City of Mist I had a real tough time finding any of the
correct kind of skellies and after having to repeatedly Feign Death and run
because of adds, I gave up and decided to try another. 
     I didn't get a chance to finish that one because by now it was late and I
had to sleep but I'm looking forward to it and thought the system was fun.  I
highly recommend getting some sow potions before you go though as there is
certain to be some travel involved.
