The reaction was certainly uncalled for, but that doesn't mean that what's 
on that .sig is "the truth" by any stretch of the imagination... The 
tobacco companies spend billions of dollars in the most sophisticated 
marketing campaigns their not inconsiderable resources can muster.

To claim that smokers smoke *only* because they want, and that they are 
solely responsible for their addiction is to oversimplify the issue 
grotesquely. I'm *all* for personal responsibility, don't get me wrong, but 
many people, especially the young, can't offer a lot of resistance to the 
quantity and quality of tobacco advertising, not to mention the addictive 
qualities of tobacco itself. I've heard that tobacco addiction has a higher 
relapse rate than heroin addiction.
