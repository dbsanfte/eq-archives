Yes!

Your list is 27 characters long. I will try to match that without
counting sub-9s and non-leveled testbuffs....

Taralynn* (wood elf ranger, Test): 65
Lorianne (gnome warrior, Test): 65
Compline* (dark elf enchanter, Test): 55
Teilie* (halfling paladin, Test): 48
Harebell (wood elf druid, Test): 44
Henbane* (erudite shadowknight, Test): 25
Larabiosa (gnome necromancer, Test): 22

Harebell (wood elf druid, Xev): 60
Betony* (wood elf ranger, Xev): 57
Sleekit* (iksar shadowknight, Xev): 30
Pollie* (gnome necromancer, Xev): 16
Sansa* (vah shir shaman, Xev): 10

Mistle (wood elf druid, Tholuxe): 60
Sarafelle* (dark elf enchanter, Tholuxe): 46
Jaise* (gnome warrior, Tholuxe): 37
Maeghan* (dark elf shadowknight, Tholuxe): 30

Kaela (human warrior, Tribunal): 53
Betony* (wood elf druid, Tribunal): 49
Bethanie* (erudite shadowknight, Tribunal): 21
Mistle* (wood elf warrior, Tribunal): 20
Pucelle* (wood elf bard, Tribunal):14
Appleblossom (gnome necromancer, Tribunal): 9

Ananda (vah shir warrior, Firiona Vie): 43
Mollie (wood elf druid, Firiona Vie): 27

Vervain (wood elf druid, Povar): 31
Khahth (dwarf paladin, Povar, my first main): 23
Wyre (wood elf druid, Povar): 16

Sleekit (dark elf cleric, Nameless): 16


* means they were twinked to some degree. Characters with no * were
leveled from scratch with nothing, and in Mistle's, Kaela's, Mollie's,
Sleekit's, and Khahth's case were created the day their servers came
up (Tholuxe, Tribunal, Firiona Vie, Nameless, and Povar respectively,
Povar being a launch server and therefore Khahth is my first ever
character). Ananda was created the day Luclin released, which was
rather soon after Firiona Vie came up, somewhere around two months
IIRC. Mistle was the first druid on Tholuxe to be L60 (earlyish kunark
era - not quite beginning though, Tholuxe wasn't up when Kunark came
out - and all through velious), and Kaela was among the first five
warriors to L50 (Tribunal predated Kunark). Even Khahth was the first
dwarf with a *bronze* bp (I lived in unrest with that character)!
Those were the days when I was uber! Martin was a mere lowbie to me,
and hughes (remember him?) not even a blip on the screen! Obviously
things have changed, as I muck around in the elementals with my ranger
hoping for molds while Martin and half a dozen others here have half a
dozen 65s and are already complaining about Uqua. Still its been a
very long journey, heh, several different guilds (formed Caelestis
Mallus on Povar with Cavos, the core of that guild would eventually,
through a permutation or two, become part of the formation of what is
now Altera Vita on Povar and Xev after serversplit (Thalassa, Medik,
Fozzie, Zetetic, Cauldyth among others), and was member of Elitists on
Tribunal and I have to admit I can't remember the name of
Ashek/Marke's guild on Tholuxe now, but it was the top guild on server
in its day... as well as Altera Vita and Dominion on Xev for a while
and Lost Legacy and now Primal Brood on Test), some of which I miss,
some of which I don't. Also:

Tryfan (dark elf shadowknight, Povar): 50
Mekkins (vah shir bard, Rathe): 53

...would be my guide characters back when I did that.

That'd be MY EQ resume. :-) In its full form, never before seen since
I don't put EQ stuff in my sig and don't talk about myself much more
than Bizbee does. But what the hell...

Other than "Ryck Dangyr" you are pretty good with names... though I am
aware Zinphandel is not an original creation and at least two are two
words in another language. :-)
