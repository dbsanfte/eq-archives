Cray makes two kinds of machines, vector machines (the traditional
Crays, from the Cray-1 through the SV-1) and massively parallell
machines (starting with the T3D).  They're now merging these into
massively parallell vector machines, it seems.

In any case, they would suck horribly for Everquest, because the CPUs
are relatively anemic on a per-processor basis, unless your program is
written in a vector processing style, which Everquest almost certainly
isn't, and even if it was an emulator wouldn't be likely to be able to
handle that.

I haven't been following Cray much lately, but the odds of them having
come up with a processor capable of emulating an x86 in software fast
enough to play Everquest seem slim.
