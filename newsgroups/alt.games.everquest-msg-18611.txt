Raise all spell casting skills to 105 and keep them maxed with each lvl - no
excuses.
Max out swimming, cast enduring breath and go swimming. I can swim faster
than I can run sowed. Definitely one I keep maxed.
Dodge, why no dodge, go train in it.
Yes, keep sense heading maxed
Tracking, max it out, makes it easier to find mobs and your friends. Easiest
way to max it? Make a hot key, click hot key, then cancel. Do this everytime
the tracking hot key is not grey until you max it.
Don't worry too much about weapon skills, especially 2h, you shouldn't be
meleeing much more. *note:most wisdom bearing weapons are 1h blunt. Of
course, there is a certain Uber item that is 1h slash.

Just recently hit the 20 with my druid and just wondered if anyone
thinks that I am missing out anywhere on my skills. I haven't used any
training points for 6 levels so I thought I'd just save them up until
I decide what my specialisation would be, any advice welcome. Here's
my skills
1H Blunt - 3
1H Slashing - 80
2H Blunt -2
Abjuration- 68
Alcohol Tol -3
Alteration - 104
Channeling - 105
Conjuration - 81
Defense -90
Divination - 22
Evocation - 105
Hand to Hand - 1
Meditate - 105
Offense - 98
Sense Heading -105
Swimming -14
