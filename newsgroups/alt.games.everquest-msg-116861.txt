Best you'll get is either Crafted (AC22 sta6 +25 health) or Enamelled Black
(AC25)
To be honest I'd take either over the Crusty BP.
Double the cash and you could get Treeweave AC24 +10str but it does look
like leather.

The Twilight (Soldiers) BP is AC22 (like the crafted) with better stats but
you won't get one for 500pp because they are far to much a PITA to obtain
then sell for that much.
