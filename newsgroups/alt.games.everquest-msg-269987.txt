Others have said it, I'll reiterate.  You can only take a tradeskill up 
to 250 maximum, period, end of story.  You can modify it up to 252.  You 
can get AAs that will reduce your failure rate on combines.  You can get 
AAs that will allow you to salvage components sometimes on failed 
combines.

All that being said, there is no easy cheap way to raise pottery at the 
high end, depending on what you mean by cheap.  Compared to some of the 
other tradeskills, pottery is cheap up to 250.  I made a mix of items, 
opal encrusted steins until trivial, then star ruby encrusted steins.  
The opal ones, I junked.  The star ruby ones, I transferred to my vendor 
mule, and sold them at a small loss usually.

If you don't mind farming a lot, you can do crucible of escape.  There 
are likely some other recipes you can try, been a while now since I've 
looked.
