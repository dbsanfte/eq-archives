It's the work around for the fact that CoTH is disabled there.  Bring
many coffins.  

You need to advance a cleric and a necro to the next island.  The necro
needs to be grouped with someone left behind (as an inviter).  The folks
without keys duel/die, the necro summons their corpse, the cleric rez's
them.  The cleric can be replaced by a pally.  

Some guilds have cleric/necro perma camped on Isle 7 and charge a pretty
penny to bridge guilds up to go after crowns for the mage epic.
