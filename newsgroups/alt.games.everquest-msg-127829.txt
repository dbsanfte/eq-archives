I'm not sure but I think Kaleor was asking what's the use of getting rezzed.

When you die you lose exp. if a cleric or a palading rezzes you you get back
some or most of that experience.

if your corpse goes bye bye you can't get it rezzed. Most ppl leave one or
two items on thier dead corpse so that a friendly rezzer can give them back
some of their hard earned experience. when you get rezzed  your corpse stays
there until you empty it and get rid of it. all equipment stays on it. All
your stuff only dissapears if you leave it on the corpse for more than a
week. after a week your corpse automatically dissapears.
