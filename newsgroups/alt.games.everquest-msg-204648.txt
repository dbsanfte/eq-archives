But that kind of dynamic content only means that you have to walk 
further to find the exact stuff that you want to kill to maximize xp/
loot.

Actually, if you randomize loot, what happens is tha people fight in the 
safest place they can find, and do not move from there. Otherwise, what 
you have is basically the way EQ dungeons work at the moment, with 
random loot within a fixed table for each mob, fixed or roaming.

The problem is, static content gives you something to look forward to, 
while auto-generated dynamic content does not.

Well, we'll have to see how SWG pans out...
