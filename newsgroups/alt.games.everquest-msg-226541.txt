How about, "Well, I enjoy doing it, but beside that I'm good at it, I'm
(slightly) higher level and take damage much better, there is no need for a
lull puller on every pull, the bard is very capable of mezzing one or two
mobs at a time even if I do get more than one (he had four successfully
mezzed after one pull--which was not min), and it was announced before we
were even to the dungeon so there was lots of time to discuss it before you
started pulling overtop of me?"
