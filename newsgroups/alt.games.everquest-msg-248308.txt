I'm at the end of my rope too with the random crashes and what seems like
almost daily patches on the Drinal server.  Half of my guild still runs into
EQ just dumping them onto the desktop if they happen to wander passed the
main PoK bank during an MGB or something.  And I love the fact that rather
than fix the problem of randomly getting stucking in some sort of plant life
(tree, shrubbery, blade of grass), they just implemented the /rewind
command.

I wish they'd dump the mandated use of DX9.  EQ worked fine beforehand
without it.  And then we didn't have to deal with baddies not staying
properly within game geometry or falling through the world when zoning.
It's always fun to get something down to 20% then have it run away into a
wall and vanish.  Or go from PoK to PoT, only to find yourself falling from
the sky in PoT and taking 300 points of falling damage. :)

Another thing that got my necromancer killed a lot was normally visible
baddies wouldn't be visible, or disappear for a little bit.  This happened
to me in BW and GD.  I'd pull something out of the giants' fort in BW, and
it'd vanish until he was at the bottom of the ramp and pounding on me.  Or
in GD with the wurms in the middle of the zone: I'd walk around wondering
where all the wurms were.  Then all the sudden I see spam of two or three
hitting me.  Change views a few times before dying, and they still weren't
visible.  Necro rezzes are expensive!

Oh well.
