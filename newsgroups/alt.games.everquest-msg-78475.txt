Go to East Freeport jump off the docks and turn slightly left. You will swim
out to the zone wall. Use the page up key to get your head above water and
then just go do something else. Skill will raise without danger of death. I
have even went LD like this and came back without any problems.

PS another reason to max out swimming? My mage can swim faster than a bard
can run. Whenever I am in a zone with water I jump in and get thru the zone
lots faster than my friends.
