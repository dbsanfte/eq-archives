Hi,

I'm looking for a guide / tips on how to do this and not get caught /
ripped off.

eg I can create a 2nd account to receive the money. But can't they
catch you because your credit card details are the same on your main
and mule accounts?

And does someone with a high rating mean anything at all? Or should I
only deal with people that have high ratings?

Is there anything out there on the web or could you post some tips
here please?
Email me if you don't want this info to be "common knowledge"

And I'm not gonna buy an account and mess up other peoples time by
getting them killed because I dont know how to play my ebayed account.
I just want to buy a cleric so that I can get rezzes "on tap". I used
to enjoy taking risks and
sometimes dying because, well, I would only lose 30mins xp. But now
I'm 50+ and if I die I lose 2hours of xp which means I don't take
risks anymore.

I'm very sorry that this post may offend a few people. I know buying
plat is a bit lame but its all a question of time. I can earn money in
rl to pay for plat more efficiently than I can pharm hill giants for
plat.

No need to post your views on why you think this is lame. I agree
already.

Please, no flames.

TIA
