OK, here's my report:

OOM when trying to root
Time elapsed, 6 minutes 12 seconds
(time running to zone not counted in clock)
Med to full, Time 5 minutes 40 seconds

Total time 11 minutes 52 seconds

Mob lowest HP point 75%

Estimated time to kill if infinite mana available, 24 minutes 48 seconds
Estimated med time to fill back to full mana, 22 minutes 40 seconds
Time per kill, 27 minutes 28 seconds

I sat to med exactly twice, and doubt very much that I med for even one
tic at any time.  The mob was rarely under swarm and root for any length
of time, either, so the DOT was doing 2/3rds its normal damage during
most of the chase.
===============================================
Attacking the exact same harrier (who had healed to full by now)

Snare
Careless 96

(at this point Harrier turns to run.  In order to keep comparison
pure as possible, I don't melee to kill, but keep nuking)

96: mob death

Time elapsed 1 minute 34 seconds

Med to full 5 minutes 24 seconds

Total time, FM to FM, 6 minutes 58 seconds

Note that mob has between 770 and 865 hp.
This would mean that at least 7 stinging swarms
if EQCastersrealm is correct in listing a 117 total
damage for the DOT.

Each swarm has a duration  of 54 seconds for
full effect.

This would mean that under perfect conditions,
Swarms would take a total of six minutes and
18 seconds to kill.  Assuming that even with
casting root, I'm able to med all the mana back
while doing the DOT/Root kill, thats only a savings
of 40 seconds over the Snare/Nuke method... oh,
but my snare/nuke run wasn't optimal either, the
penultimate nuke would have been a kill if it had
hit for even half damage, instead of for one.

As another side note, I took damage down to 75% hp
myself while attempting the root/DOT approach.  Root
seems to have a very short cast range, and I'm no
expert at judging the correct distance so that a resist
doesn't get me hit.  I assume someone skilled at the
art will not get hit at all, though, and besides healed
completely while medding a full bar of mana.
