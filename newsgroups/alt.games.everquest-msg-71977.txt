Thanks for the advice, I just hit lvl 35 and notice thst in fights the
fungi obviously still helps but isnt as incredible. However I really
like the fact that it reduces my down time drastically. I have enough
gear on an alt that I dont use anymore that I may be able to scrape up
enough for silver chitin wraps. last I checked they were 5 to7K on
Xegony.
