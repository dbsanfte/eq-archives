Joined up with guild for a scheduled Fear raid, both because hey, I'm up 
for anything but also there's an epic mob for me in there, and assuming 
we clear the place out it seems like I'll be another step closer to epic.

During buff up, its repeatedly anounced that avoiding the Ireblind Imp 
is going to be the key issue.

Doh, thats my mob!

Further, he's apparantly killable by a pair of 65s, or a single bard...

Well, I ask if there's a reason we're avoiding him, in tells, and I'm 
told he's pretty hard but also no reason to kill him, cause he's for 
berserker epic.  I point out that I happen to be a berserker and 
wouldn't at all mind.  Raid leader concedes that in that case, he's not 
too hard once most of the zone is cleared, and perhaps we can take him 
out.  Its not the target we are there for, and I'm fine with a Maybe.

So, we invis up and run in, instructions to turn right, run to wall.

After zoning in and doing this, further instructions come to head to 
yellow tower.  So far so good, I've seen mobs but none have aggroed me.

Mobs at the yellow tower, and people fighting them.  After a moment or 
two I join in, breaking my invis.  We end up killing 8 or 9 mobs as 
people keep training them in, presumably their invis dropped on the way.

Then someone brings my buddy, the Ireblind Imp.  He's a pain, repeatedly 
slapping a mez on me that lasts 30 seconds or so.  My MR is at 247, I 
don't see a single resist message.

Well, we still manage to clear out adds decently, and someone manages to 
kite the Imp off somewhere, at which point the call comes to camp out.

Off I go to dreamland for a few seconds, but I log back in; there were 
no mobs in camp, I was just (I thought) clearing aggro.  Boom, mob on 
me.  I fight it a bit, but I'm losing trying to solo it... and then my 
HP drops low enough that suddenly every other mob in the area breaks 
away and comes for me, at least 10 of them.

Well, it takes quite a while but eventually rezzes start, and we're back 
in business.  Buffs get run and we're medding, ready to go in about a 
minute... suddenly boom.

I think I've LD'd, but there's a loading please wait splash screen. 
Then I'm at character select.  Try to log in, zone unavailable.  Log in 
an alt, he's fine, and people are reporting back from Fear so I log back 
out, back in to Grage... looking at no buffs and the rez icon and 85% hp.

Turns out Fear itself crashed, and when it comes up its empty.

Leader goes to chat server and is told he should petitions.  I'm not 
sure if this was what he was told or if he just added this, but he asked 
us to all petition.

This is my first time petitioning since the change.  Its not possible to 
send a generic petition.  You have to pick a category.  None of the 
categories are the least bit appropriate.  I finally select Zone 
Disruption, which is clearly intended for reporting griefers, but seems 
closest to the problem to me.

I explain that Fear crashed and is now empty, and we'd like it repopped. 
  All golems, Ireblind Imp, and Cazic Thule had been up.

After an hour with zero response, we end up calling it.

As an aside, our conjecture is that a former raid left the ireblind imp 
up and someone petitioned to have zone repopped to remove him, and that 
the GMs did so without checking to see if anyone was in the zone.
