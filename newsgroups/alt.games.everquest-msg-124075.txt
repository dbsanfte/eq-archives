    That's the best way of doing it. You could also:

(1) Make a level 1 troll / ogre / dark elf, run them to OT, and use them to
pull the body.
(2) Use Divine Aura when you run in close to where you usually get attacked.
That'll give you 18 seconds to try and pull the bodies as far away as
possible before dying again.
(3) Buy some Invis potions, and use those to get close. You have to be
careful of the undead, though.

    But, really, Dream King's way is the best and I bet the easiest,
assuming you aren't on a Zek server or something like that.
