People end up joining our guild because they've grouped up with
one of the members and asked them about the guild. Try that. If
you're in a group with guilded members, ask them about the re-
quirements of their guild.

I always have it but I'm not sure if you'll die or not if you don't
have any. That 'You are out of drink and food' message bugs me.

Yes, you have to be logged in for your trader to be up.
