I've been trying to get the parts for a moth ring without paying the
inflated prices of the bazaar (the final product sells for 20 silver but the
parts for 100 silver each) and to make them spawn i've been harvesting. What
I've observed is that there are some players i call poachers; they run about
afk, they never harvest or fight, all they do is grab the spawns i'm
generating.

Now it seems to me that an easy way to fix this would be to make it that the
collectables appear as part of the harvest in  the same way rares do. I've
feedbacked this idea. If anyone else agrees, please do the same and maybe
the rules will be changed in a patch soon.
