<Cut text lots of it>

My personal experience on this 'plz' matter is as fllows:

If im travelling round and i see a small group/lone player, i go over take a
seat and just chill for a bit and have a chat! More often than not we end up
helping each other in anyway we can, this includes Shadow of wolf and
Clarity ETC.

the point is, if you dont hastle people, people (me included) will help,
just out of gratitude for having a chat and breaking away from the
kill...get xp.... path that you must take (which is still fun dont get me
wrong).

I think the whole reason most of us play is to escape 'the real world.com'
We do this by playing EQ because whilst in the EQ enviroment all.most real
world matters arn't important. Its a game and an escape this is why we play,
people that use obsence and pointless language/behaviour will grow out of
it, or stop playing (We hope) but i guess the only way of dealing with is it
just say ' aww bless em, little do they know' :)

***This is just an opion, im not saying my view are final! Im just voicing
my opion on how i feel about EQ***

oh yeah..add rants below they all mean so much to me :)
