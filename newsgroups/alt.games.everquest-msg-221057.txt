Don't need temp if you are following me around to cast the buff,
just your free AC buff will do the same AC job; higher as you
level up further.  HP is nice and all but for the purposes of
this test, the real question is does the extra AC save some HP
each time the little puff of logic gets hit?

Pay for the account and I'll be glad to dual box that chanter
up... although frankly you'd be better off asking me to dual box
a bard instead, since you can buy KEI.   Bard mana stacks with
KEI... at least it does now, hard to say what will happen next
nerf.

Why can't I buy Temp as easily?  Because KEI travels, while I'd
need the Temp on my pet, which means I can't go to POK, get it,
and then go to where I want to kill things.  Being a mage sucks. 
Good thing we're gods eventually.
