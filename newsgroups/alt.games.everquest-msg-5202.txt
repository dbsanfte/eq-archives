Speak to you guild leader OOC about what happened. I'm 99.9% sure
they'll understand, and help you out. It's you 'the player' they guilded
after all. It's a roleplaying guild so should be fairly trivial, and
enjoyable, to work out a storyline whereby your L22 is sacrificed for
some reason, and becomes rebourn in a new L1 on your new account. Since
you are born from the death of another, it's only fair you inherit what
was his: His equipment, his reputation, his place in the guild, and you
might even get lucky and get the same name through the name filter if
you delete the old character first.
