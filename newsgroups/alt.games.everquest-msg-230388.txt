I was wondering if I could get advice from some of you "experienced" EQ
players.  I started a Bard several months ago, leveled him to 20, then
stripped his gear and sold it.  Now that LDoN has come out; I've noticed
that I really enjoy having a good bard in my group.  So I have decided to
start playing my bard again to see if I can do what I have learned to like
so much about other bards.  What I was wondering is could I get some advice
on equipment for my bard.  I have about 50k I can spend on him, but I want
to focus on proper stats that I would need.  Thanks for any advice!
