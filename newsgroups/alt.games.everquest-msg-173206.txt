Cool -- so you're willing to bet me $1000 (US) that after we
go into Iraq militarily (which seems inevitable, given Saddam's
behavior), the US is going to "bag" the Iraqi oil (i.e., confiscate
it for ourselves), right?

Please, oh, please, take me up on this.  As a wise man once
said, "never argue with a fool, bet him money".

And please line up as many of your friends and talking heads
on the "discussion programmes" as well, I'll take all comers.

If you're not willing to put your money where your mouth is,
try this one on for size:  twelve months after the ceasefire,
if the US has *not* confiscated the Iraqi oilfields and instead
has left the local leadership of Iraq in charge of it, you
have to come here and post, "I'm sorry, I was a fucking moron".

Sooner or later, it helps to do a reality check -- here's
your chance.

In the meantime, feel free to ponder how many of the "blood for
oil" parrots before/during the *first* Gulf War ended up looking
like imbeciles when the US, against all their expectations,
kicked Iraq out of Kuwait and then WENT BACK HOME instead of
greedily sucking all the oil out of Iraq.

Yeah, that nasty US, taking ownership of all those countries it
has conquered, like Germany.  Wait, bad example.  Okay, Japan.
Um, sorry.  Let me think, I'm sure I'll find an example if I
think hard enough, because all those Brits couldn't be wrong,
could they?

Yawn.

Because back then, Iran was a greater terrorism threat than
Iraq.  Things change.

If you're so sure, you wouldn't mind laying a thousand bucks on it,
right?
