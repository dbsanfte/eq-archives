VSR spawns more frequently than VS.  VS is usually killed by a raid 
within a reasonable time of him spawning, at least on EMarr.  VS is a 3 
day spawn, VSR is probably 1 day, if VS is not up.  VSR is not a 
triggered spawn, just not allowed to spawn if VS is up I think.  As I 
recall, you are in your low 50s?  You will need a decent raid force at 
that level to even think about taking out VS, if it's doable at that 
level, I honestly don't recall.  Your best bet is to wait until VS is 
killed, then watch for VSR, and call in whoever you can get.  If you can 
get a few 65ish folks, then VSR is a cakewalk.
