I've seen several requests here asking folks playing Legends if the price
upgrade was worth it.  Haven't seen any answers...anyone besides me think
the price increase is a result of not enough players (seems there are still
spots open to join Legends).  Not bitching about the price increase, as I'll
likely do the 2 year thing and pay what I'm paying now (after I do some
math), and I do know 3 years there should be some type of price increase.
But I would like to see some added service along the lines of Legends type
stuff.  I would like to think that ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR A MONTH
increase would pay for some more input from their end
