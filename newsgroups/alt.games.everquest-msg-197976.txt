I just bought the trilogy off of Amazon.com.  I've been playing UO off
and on since 1997, and have grown very disenchanted with it.  I'm
looking for something new, and interesting, and I'm hoping this will
keep me entertained for a little while.  Since I am using google
groups, I would very much appreciate an e-mail response, as it takes
all day to get any information posted here.

Are there any role players on EQ?  I sure hope the "Spawn Camp" thing
isn't such a problem here.

Of course, as with all games... There's the human element.
