That's the problem...won't/can't get used to it.  I'm already 12-18" away
from my 19" monitor...and not really noticing the pixelization of the lower
resolution anyway, only when not moving and in the right conditions/looking
at the right things, such as the banker in N Freeport, in his red shirt with
the light walls behind him, that is one of the FEW times I notice where a
higher resolution would make a difference, and as I said, if I'm moving I
probably won't realize it.
    Now, get me a 25" monitor and I might try to run EQ at 800x600.
