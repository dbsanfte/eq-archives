Unfortunately, this isn't working for me.  Perhaps I am hunting in the
wrong places.  I have done dawnshroud peaks and eastern wastes.  These
mobs are great for quadding, but they don't drop any cash loot. 
Unless, of course, the market for zelniak meat suddenly goes through
the roof.

Now, granted, there are ways for me to go out and make money - I
accumulated 2k from 1-29.  But that's not the issue I wanted to
discuss - rather, I was curious what other people felt about how to
_invest_ the money.
