Yes, there are certainly mobs where chain CHeal is appropriate, and even
the only solution.  But I've been in plenty of raid situations where
CHeal is the principle heal, but Chain CHeal is overkill.

There is a vast middle ground of mobs that hit hard enough to make CHeal
the heal of choice, but not so hard that chain CHeal is needed.  Heck,
we didn't even resort to chain CHeal on the MA in our recent turtle
kill...  and I think that if we had, we'd have all run OOM with the
turtle not yet at half dead, followed shortly by Lodizal lunching on all
the tanks, healers, and misc personelle in that order.

CHeal on demand, rather than chain CHeal, strikes me as the order of the
day for group and raid healing anywhere but up against a boss mob...
something where you are in a very limited duration fight with a very
hard hitting mob, and the fact that you are going to be OOM at the
fights end will not matter at all, since its only that one battle you
need to get thru.

I also wonder sometimes whether a divine light chain might not do a
better job than a CHeal chain in most circumstances.  DL does around
1khp per cast, taking 4.5 seconds.  For Cheals to outdo this, they need
to heal more than 1khp each cast.  With 4 clerics casting in perfect
sync, this means a heal per 2.5 seconds... and still beats out DL only
if the MA is taking more than 450 hp in damage every 2.5 seconds.  Chain
DL with 4 clerics, you are looking at around 1khp per second, meaning
the tank under the CHeal barrage would have to be taking 2500hp in
damage per 2.5 seconds... which isn't something I've seen happening so
far.

Of course I also don't know that we can normally field three or four DL
clerics, in order to try that protocol...
