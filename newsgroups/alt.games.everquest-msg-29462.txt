It's a bit difficult to know what you're talking about here
w/o a quote, but tinkering is nowhere near as restrictive
as Alchemy.   Any gnome can tinker, but no skill increases
happen until level 16.

After that, it's just another tradeskill, except it's an even
bigger money sink than the others from what I can tell, and
one without any market at any stage that makes money or
even any real use for the person creating the item.   But let's
not get me started about Tinkering.
