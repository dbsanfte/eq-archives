And none of these mobs are, to my recollection, the kind of mobs that
one would even try to quad anyway.  Maybe sonic wolves, but TM is a
horrible zone for quadding.

If anything, with the resist changes, it's EASIER to quad now than
before.

And the exp changes hurt soloers in general, not just those that
wanted to quad.  Which, by your logic, seems to mean that you think
Verants sees soloing as an exploit.
