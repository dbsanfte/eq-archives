Of course, it is stuck way back in the class abilities section of AA, with
about 15 or so points of prerequisites (including normal character level of
59), and is one of our least exciting AA skills... so by the time the warrior
reaches the point where he has it, he's most likely so bored of killing
ubermobs that he quits the game before using it for the first time. ; )
