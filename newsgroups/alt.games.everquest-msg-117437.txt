The article in question is here:
http://www.jsonline.com/news/state/mar02/31536.asp

Here's what I see is the essence of the problem:

Woolley knows her son had problems beyond EverQuest, and she tried to
get him help by contacting a mental health program and trying to get
him to live in a group home. A psychologist diagnosed him with
depression and schizoid personality disorder, symptoms of which
include a lack of desire for social relationships, little or no sex
drive and a limited range of emotions in social settings.

So, the kid turns to EverQuest, to get away from his problems. His
mother HATES the game. She criticizes it throughout the article. I
have to imagine that any time he spent playing EverQuest was probably
marred by his mother periodically screaming, "Will you get off that
damned game? You're going to have another SEIZURE," "Turn off that
computer and go find a job," "Stop playing that damned game. You'll
rot your brain."

I think the bitch nagged him to death.
