Remarkably uninformative, considering Cecil usually delivers pretty well.

Try this one, plucked at random from Ask Jeeves:

(deep in the midst of http://www.sasklifestyles.com/archive/Oct.16-01.htm)

My next query I�ll pose is�.What exactly is Daylight Saving Time
                   (yes that is singular, NOT Daylight Savings Time, as we
are saving
                   daylight, which is singular, not plural) and when/why did
it
                   originate?
                   Daylight Saving Time is a change in the standard time of
each time
                   zone. It was a conservation measure and a response to
dwindling
                   national resources. Factories and offices could reduce
electric
                   lighting needs if daylight hours better fit working
hours. This was
                   accomplished instantly and easily by resetting the clock.

                   The idea to cheat Father Time and observe DST started
during
                   wartime (U.S. Congress placed the country on DST in 1918
for the
                   remainder of WWI; reinstated it during WWII in 1942 until
1945;
                   from 1945 to 1966 no specific law was in place). In 1966,
there was
                   much confusion so the Uni form Time Act was established
stating
                   that DST would begin on the last Sunday of April and end
the last
                   Sunday of October. In 1988, the Act was modified to begin
DST the
                   first Sunday of April.
                   Since wartime, the need for DST has shifted slightly;
more to suit
                   today�s busy workplace, than an energy savings. And, if
energy
                   consumption was our primary concern, our resetting dates
are
                   occurring at the wrong time of the year, with little or
no energy at
                   all. In mid-summer, daylight hours far exceed the
standard
                   workday, so no saving can be realized. In mid-winter, the
hour
                   difference between DST and Standard Time, merely
determines
                   which hours will require electricity - not the actual
consumption.
                   So, once again, there is no saving. There are truly only
two short
                   periods of the year that DST would actually reduce energy
-
                   between summer and winter. During late fall, around
October, and
                   during spring, in February and March, business day
electrical use
                   would be reduced. The funny thing is, that during this
time of the
                   year the nation is on Standard Time, not DST.
                   The topic of Daylight Saving Time has been a hot one,
especially in
                   Saskatchewan. The majority of Canada, excepting our fine
                   province, has followed suit with our American neighbours
in
                   adopting this time cheat. Most likely for lack of putting
it all down
                   on paper, has anyone realized that DST has no actual
benefits -
                   just confusion.
                   I would like to know who gave us the right to change
time? And, if
                   anyone can find the dude, can you ask him (or her) if he
(or she)
                   could add a couple of more days to the week; time seems
to be
                   slipping by so quickly, I could sure use them.

So I seem to be off on the farmer thing, but I still stick to my guns on my
insistence that its quite silly and useless; it has no real affect, and I
believe any small savings you might be able to point to is almost certainly
offset by the enourmous waste of time involved in setting dozens of clocks
per household and business ahead and back, and accidents or lost work time
caused by the instant "jet lag" confusion, not to mention those people who
fail to set a clock correctly and miss appointments or work times or arrive
at them an hour early; sure, this is fairly stupid but it does happen to a
measurable percentage of the population each time shift, and there's a
measureable expense associated with it.

So if you want to count the pennies that a few minutes less use of electric
lighting over a few weeks each year adds up to, you have to count the
pennies of the various sorts of lost time due to jumping the cicardian
system's of a few hundred million people each year.  Oh, and while you are
counting that, consider that we live in a global economy, and most of the
world doesn't change their clocks, so there's inevitably going to be some
additional confusion there twice a year.  If you've already granted me that
a percentage of americans manage to get this wrong, imagine someone from
Kuala Lampur having to remember that those crazy Americans (in -some-
states/provinces) change their clocks for no discernable reason, so that 8
o'clock conference call may be happening at 7 o'clock, or is it 9 o'clock?
More wasted money, not a lot perhaps, but you know, a million dollar
business here or there, what is it they say in congress, "a billion here, a
billion there, pretty soon it starts to add up to real money"
