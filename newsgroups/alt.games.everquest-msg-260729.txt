Always a SOWer?

Lets see, druid, ranger, shaman, beastlord

Those are the SOW casting classes.

Not one of them is part of the holy trinity.

I can count the number of druids my 56 berserker has grouped with on... 
I was going to say one hand, but I can do better.  One finger.  Druids 
seem to be a vanished commodity.  I'm not picky, I group with anyone who 
hasn't already proven himself to be an ass (and for that I probably have 
to have grouped with him once); this suggests to me that there really 
arne't druids LFG.  While useful in a "what is this group missing?  I 
can do that" sort of way, they aren't best at anything, and so tend to 
be overlooked.

Shaman I do still see, despite complaints that slow mitigation and low 
hp mobs have made them useless.   Still, they are no more than an 
option; you can instead get a chanter for slows and a cleric for heals. 
  I'm suprised if you've grouped with a lot of shaman, since shaman plus 
cleric is somewhat redundant.

Rangers are one of the many DPS classes, and not the best of them 
either; I don't see that many of them (more than druids, to be sure) and 
certainly can't say that I've never been in a group without one.

Beastlords are popular, a high DPS class with some off tanking ability 
and some nice candy buffs, particularly in a shamanless group.  But 
again, this is like "hey, some hot fudge for my ice cream" rather than 
"you have toppings but no ice cream"; they aren't a "key class" and I've 
been in more groups without one than with one.

I think I've spent half my berserker's life with no SOWer in full 
groups, and far more than half of his small group and (obviously) solo 
carreer with no SOWer.

I do rely heavily on SOW potions as a transport mechanism, recent 
changes to mob run speed mean I tend to blow off SOW for ordinary 
fighting as I can outrun the mobs anyway.  SO I actually suprised myself 
when looking at spending my first AA by thinking about not getting Run 
1.  I ended up doing it anyway, as it still strikes me that Run 3 is 
more useful than any of the other tier one AA.  I wouldn't have stopped 
leveling in order to get it, though; I was spending my free AA from POJ 
trials flag.

Berserk is not bard though, and neither is cleric.  Bards can cast while 
moving, and DO, all the time.  Bard speed relative to mob speed is a 
paramount issue.  Selos, believe it or not, is a pain; non bards think 
of it as a free ticket, but it takes a song slot and a buff slot and for 
full effect requires juggling a drum, and then its TOO FAST for most 
purposes, and you end up a bard with Walk on... when it drops (or gets 
dispelled) now you're slower than every guy in the group except the 
berzerk who's running around self snared with Fungal Regrowth, and its a 
race to see who can click their snare off first!

Run 3 means more to a bard than to any other class I can think of, 
perhaps excepting a monk.

Grage, 56 Berzerk
Llyric, 57 bard
Bergh, 65 cleric
and a host of others
