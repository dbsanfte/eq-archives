You can do a quest to turn PK back off.  Might have to petition to get the
quest mob spawned.  Sometimes, the GM will just turn PK off for you, instead
of spawning the quest mob.

I've heard that, at least at one time...they might have fixed this, that when
players dueled, they were also able to attack and be attacked by PK players.
If that's true, there are all kinds of amusing prank possibilities in being
a high level PK.

Actually, some of the best duelers have been Clerics.  If you specifically
equip yourself for PvP, you'll do a lot better.  Unless you are really into
dueling, though, it's probably not worth it.
