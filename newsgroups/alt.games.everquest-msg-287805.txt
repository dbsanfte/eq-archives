	Besides posting advance notice of scheduled downtime I mean.

	Go back and reduce the required levels of some of the existing
items.  There's some stuff with req level 65 and 68 and even 60 that's
totally outclassed by even trash drops from new expansions but which
would fit right in to today's typical 50-65 slots.

	For instance, the stuff from the buried sea which was always
req level'd too high anyway.
