Here's why it is so valuable... at high levels you get de-buffed, you
put this and your other clicky-insta-cast buffs on, as you are
debuffed, you can slap it back on and keep your "good" buffs intact. 
For my monk and shaman, the BotH is invaluable.  I normally go farm
one a week or so to keep one on all my toons that are above lvl 40ish.

I prolly should sell one or two of them, but it would be a pain as
they are lore items...  nah, I'll just give the next one to a guildy
or a rank newbie.
