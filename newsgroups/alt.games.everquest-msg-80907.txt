    Nobody knows what these are for, or at least has said publically. The
Hole has a large number of unsolved mysteries. There's "hidden" rooms with
what look like teleport pads in them, and at least one quest was discovered
by just guessing at what the NPC meant. (The NPC in question asked for "a
shiny", and someone figured to hand him a Shiny Metallic Robe from Lower
Guk - 50/50 chance of getting a lump of metal or a new, upgraded robe.) I'd
love to go there some day and explore and hail away, but as a cleric of
Brell I quite frankly don't want to take the faction hits.

    The "not implemented" part is what stops people from even looking. When
I heard that the four forageable crystals from Skyfire had no use in game as
of yet, I swore off questing for weeks. Why bother trying to figure out
something if that something isn't guaranteed of leading *somewhere*?
