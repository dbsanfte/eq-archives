I'm sure there will be ebaying of both items and characters in eq2.  It's
completely inevitable for the design being used (items and levels in exchange
for time spent, and transferable between people in a verifiable way).

I suspect it will "own" eq2 in exactly the same way as it did eq1.  That is to
say it will annoy some people, and have very little effect on those who choose
to ignore it.  There will be some amount of camp/quest contention among
players, and ebay/yantis will be blamed (incorrectly IMO) for some of it.

I hate to break it to you, but most of those idiots are not purchased.  A
few are, but most are powerlevelled/twinked homegrown characters, or non-paid
transfers from a friend or family member.  And some who actually played all
their levels, but just managed to miss learning the topics you consider
basic.

The ebay buyers I've known generally are decent players.  If someone puts
up real money for an account, there's generally a reason for it and
they're willing to spend some effort to learn the game.
