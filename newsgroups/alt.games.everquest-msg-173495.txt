i'd like to boost my DEX and STA of course, and i'm thinking my AC needs
some serious work.  keeping up STR and WIS would be nice as well.

things i want to go after:
eyepatch of plunder
lodizal shell shield (for use as an EB item, wouldn't be wearing it
fulltime)
swiftwind (duh?)

my guild should be able to take down lodizal without much of a problem.

was considering buying a fancy velvet mantle for 3kpp last night since it
was basically the only thing better than my seb scale mantle in the bazaar
at the time...

money isn't a problem.

thanks in advance for any advice!
