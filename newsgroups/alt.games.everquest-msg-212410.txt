I've got some questions about the Dire Charm AAXP ability (the
Enchanter one, if that makes a difference.)

If I try to DC my target and it's too high level, does that generate
any aggro?  And would the hotkey then be immediately available
again, or does it have to go through the full recycle?

Thanks.
