Any FT item should have at least FT1 at level 1.  It has been verified that 
the solstice earring FT works at level 1 despite its recommended level of 
51.  I think it's just like any other stat on an item: minimum you get from 
it is 1.  Whether you can get the cash together for such items at level 23 
is still debatable.

You may be able to go after the FT range item from the hollowshade war in 
your early 30s if you can get your guild together to help you out with it.  
Fun event for mid-level guilds, easily soloed by high-level characters.
