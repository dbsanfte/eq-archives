I didn't even start my archery skill until mid-30's, but what I did was to find
a Light Blue, root it with grasping roots, and pump arrows into them.  Using
store-bought arrows, you will never kill it since their regen is higher than
the damage output.  In  a few hours, my archery went from 30 to over 100.   I
don't believe you can gain skill on archery by shooting greens.
