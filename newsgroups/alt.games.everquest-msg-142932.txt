I was noticing some trends on Drinal and wondered if this seemed to be
happening game-wide.  For most items the bazaar is a buyers market.
Especially for low-end items.  Mid-levels like me can just forget getting
anything for the crap loot we pick up.  I guess even the newbies are getting
better deals.  Anyway, it seems that where the real money is, is in trade
skill components.  Acrylia goes for 40-400 pp depending on the size of the
block/brick, and silk swatches are being priced at 25pp ea.  Leather padding
goes for around 20-25pp ea.

This just seems amazing to me.  I know the spiders can be pretty stingy when
it comes to dropping silk, but two silks are still much more common than a
HQ bear pelt that also sells for around 25pp.  Not to mention Acrylia which
is actually pretty common in several zones.  Where are these prices coming
from?
