I think there's a big difference in our criteria, as well.  I would assume
you put an emphasis on Canadian-style universal access to health care.
OTOH, I emphasise the U.S. _quality_ of health care.  You would probably put
a premium on gun control, I wouldn't want to live anywhere that does not
recognize my right to defend myself.  Small differences in viewpoints will
inevitably lead to a different ranking.

I believe that the free market is perfectly capable of that, when all
information is freely available.  Still, there's enough slickness out there
to keep many things hidden until long after the damage is done.  It's the
job of the government, IMHO, to ensure the information stays in the public
eye, where the market _can_ punish abuseres.
