I'm sure you're right. I didn't mean it that way actually. My reference 
was more a reflection of my own philosophy on the subject. If I venture 
into a new environment - someone else's house, if you will - such as has 
happened here, I am going to do my best not to bristle at every comment 
that could be taken negatively - don a thick skin, as they say. I would 
try to contribute without presumption or pretense. At some point, people 
would come to at least understand me as I, in turn, would come to 
understand them.

So, in the interest of clarification, let me rephrase the prevous by 
saying don't bring negative attitudes into someone else's forums. No, we 
don't own a.g.e. or anything, but it is comprised of us and has been for 
quite some time. We have a vested interest in promoting its community 
atmosphere and potential for providing assistance with all things EQ and 
even some not. 

With any luck one day the folks of EMarr Forums will enjoy that 
distinction too. Here's to hoping that is the case.
