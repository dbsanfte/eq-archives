    It's all about the Shakerpage, Davian. Equip that Earthshaker, get
someone to slow you, pull a boatload of mobs, hit Furious and Rampage! Our
guild actually used to buy Earthshakers just for those few cases where doing
a Shakerpage was the best way to clear junk, like if you messed up on that
guy with the skeletons in the Carprin cycle in CoD.
