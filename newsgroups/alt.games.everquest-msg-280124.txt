As others have answered, the only one you're missing is Dragons of
Norrath, which you can probably do without for now.  The highlights
of each expansion are also listed in the FAQ.

Question for someone who doesn't have DoN: I know the Guild Lobby
isn't available without DoN, and I assume the Bandolier and Potion
Belt are also missing.  What about the Barter Hall?  It was
originally a separate zone, and DoN-only, but now that it's been
merged into the Bazaar is it possible for non-DoN-owners to sell
to people who've set up buyers there?  Can a non-owner set up a
buyer?

Hm, I should also ask the eqtraders channel whether you need to buy
DoN to work on the new cultural tradeskills (unless someone here
happens to know).

Heh, I was going to send out the monthly FAQ post today, but maybe
I'll wait to see if I can get the above answered first. :-)
