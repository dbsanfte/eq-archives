I was hunting the basement in High Keep, with a group of course, and the
comment was made that there were very few of my type (untwinked) of people
around. One of my group members decided to change all that and gave me some
lovely equipment. I had been saving my PP to buy myself some decent
armor/weapons and now I need to focus on what I need to replace. I am very
thankful that I will need to replace so much less then I had planned on
(thanks Yuen!).

I now have...

Head Turtleshell Helm     AC 5  Str +3

Ears Onyx   AGI +2,  and Jade inlaid hoop STR +1  WIS +1 AGI  +1 SV Disease
+2

Face Reinforced mask AC 4

Neck Golden Black pearl choker  DEX +7  AGI +7

Shoulders Rawhide Shoulder pads AC 3 (was thinking about turning in bracers
of battle for   prayer cloth of Tunare)

Chest Fungal Fiend Membrane tunic AC8

Back Banded Cloak AC? (sorry forgot to write it down)

Arms Lupine runed Armband STR +3 AGI +3

Wrist Silver Onyx Bracelet DEX +2  and Serpentine bracer AC1  DEX +3  AGI +9

Hands Dark Mail Gautlets AC 10   DEX +5   Mana +50

Finger Cutthroat Insignia ring AC1  DEX +2

Waist Straw Spun Belt AC 10

Legs Tizmark Legs AC 8

Feet Kobold Hide Boots AC 5   AGI+3  HP +10

Weapons  Primary Icetooth's Claws Dmg 10, Delay 29

Off hand Enameled Black Mace Dmg 8, Delay 28

Range Rough Elm Recurve Dmg 11, Delay 43, Range 75 (working on fletching
skill for Sureshot or is it Trueshot? bow)

I also have about 400 PP to spend, but on what? Any help would be much
appreciated as I have never done this before. I've never even had a char
above level 12 before! Thanks
