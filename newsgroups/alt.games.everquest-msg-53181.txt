Well you have to check it out for yourself.

I can tell you though, you are doub (I think I know it isn't lower) with the
Erudite guard (in Erudian not Paineel, those are Heretics), you are KOS to
guards in Qeynos, and you are indifferently to beggars in the sewers. You
are KOS to the guards in the sewers, indiff I believe to mercenaries, and
indiff I think in the Shrine (The evil guild in the sewers by the spectres
which are also indiff I believe but won't act like guards to anything other
then beetles if I remember correctly...)
