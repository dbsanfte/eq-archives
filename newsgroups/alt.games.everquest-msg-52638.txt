I couldn't tell.... Only been around in the game since May....

Also no faction? That, to me, seems to be the biggest coincidence there...

The golem next to her?
It's brown, all right, and normally not there...

But then, it might as well have been around for weeks, since
you said it is no faction, this might explain what happened to me weeks
ago:

I was guiding a lowbie elf to Lavastorm, and short before zone a golem
jumped
him (can't remember the color, thought it was a stone golem, though).
I didn't wanna get the lowbie killed, so I sent in my pet and told him to
run.

I was prepared for a nasty faction hit, but before I reached Lava zone,
my pet came BACK to me, and I got no faction hit at all...
I never understood this.
Maybe it was a brown golem like this one.


Anyways - I would suggest we keep gathering info about NPCs like this one,
maybe we can solve the riddle....

Awaiting the solution...
