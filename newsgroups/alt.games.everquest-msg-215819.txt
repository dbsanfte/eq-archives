Right. The point I've tried to spell out a few times is that there's a
difference between an "aggressive" approach and a "reckless" approach.
Moving fast, I understand. Going slow will run you out of time
quickly. Rushing recklessly will cause a wipe more often than not, and
a wipe costs more time than just slowing down the pace a bit.

And, as a note to Faned. I don't play to win. I play to have fun. That
is the entire purpose of playing a game, after all. If your idea of
fun is winning all the time, fine. Mine isn't (I don't exactly view EQ
as a contest of any sort, anyway. Thus, not really something that you
can "win").
