 Ok...maybe im doing something wrong here...but lets say your buying something
that costs.....1000pp off a player...and you have like 10000pp on you...you go
to try to give the money to them and move the middle bar thing to try and
withdrawl 1000pp but it wont let you get anywhere close to 1000pp...like
1300pp..do you have to single click 300x's to get it to 1000?...i hope i didnt
sound tooo retarded there..and made some kind of sense...thanks for the help
