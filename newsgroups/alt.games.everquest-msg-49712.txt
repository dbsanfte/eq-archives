For what it's worth, the next Letham book I picked up was, in fact, Wall
of the Sky, Wall of the Eye. I finished a silly Terry Pratchett novel
first this weekend, but then started in on that one. I have to say, his
short stories are, if anything, even better than the two novels of his
I've read. Again, of course, they have the same ..... "tone".  The best
way of describing this would be, IMO, to say "Jonathan Letham has heard
of words like 'happy', 'light', and 'whimisical'. He simply wants
nothing whatsoever to do with them."

As to the genre, I've found them in the Sci-Fi section, though it's
certainly not all hard core sci-fi with spaceships and lasers, etc. But
a lot of it does take place in the future with hints at technologies
that don't currently exist. But mostly, it takes place, in dark, bleak,
gloomy landscapes that he spins together out of his own demented mind. 

I'm really liking this guy. ;-)

Q: How many surrealists does it take to screw in a light bulb? 
A: Two. One to hold the giraffe and the other to fill the bathtub with
brightly colored machine tools.
