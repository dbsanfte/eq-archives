First and foremost thanks for responding to my question.

I have done some research and can get an ATI 9200 that says it is DX9
compatible for about $100.00.

Here is my thing, do you think this will fix the problems that I am having
with my NVidia GeForce 4 ti 4200 AGP 8X??

Also if I do get it how hard is it to remove the GeForce card and install
the new one.  Actually, I know I can handle to swap physically, I am just
worried about having old NVida drivers and the like.

Thanks in advance
