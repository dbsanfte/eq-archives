Might be able to fear kite. Certainly you could archery kite if you use
a tolans bracer and snare... You'd have to be pretty bloody minded though,
in that it'll be long and bloody ;)

At the top end of the game its not just that you're a 'chain class' though,
its simply that *no* class is going to be able to stand and tank without
a healer. When the hole first came out it was *hard*, the mobs
annhilated entire raids. The only reason you can solo there now is that
its content many years older than the gear you're using to fight it.

Mmm. Well, you certainly can solo to 65. It'll just take you a long time
and your gear will suck, but if thats not stuff you care about then go for it ;)
