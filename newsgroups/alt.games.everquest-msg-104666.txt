Getting ready to pick up the last bits for my wizard's Staff of
Temperate Flux this week. But it turns out that a 57 wizard in our guild
had never gotten one, and was going to do it also. (Don't ask me why he
didn't int he first 56 levels ... /shrug)  Anyway, last night I'm still
working on perfecting my non-SoTF multi-kiting and trying not to die,
when suddenly Uberwizard_01 comes in guild chat and informs me that I'd
better watch out doing the quest, because he just turned in his items
and gave the druid rock to the quest mob last, and got a "Gee, thanks."
But no staff.

When I asked him to check his faction, he said the quest mob in Temple
of Sol Ro conned apprehensive to him.

So... was that the reason? Or could he have just turned in some wrong
item? Just what *is* everyone's starting faction in that zone, and what
does it need to be to do the quests? Tiru and I did most of the necro
quests in there with no faction work (beyond slaughtering some fairly
small number of shadowed men for quest components) and we're not even
Necros! And the quests all worked.

It won't be the end of the world if I don't get it on one go, but does
my erudite 26 wizzie need to be doing some Sol Ro faction work before
turning in his part on the MQ for the Staff of Temperate Flux? Any good
way to check this in advance? And if so, what's the best/fastest way to
improve your faction in there?
