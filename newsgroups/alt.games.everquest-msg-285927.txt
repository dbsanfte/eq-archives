I might also add that if you just recently "upgraded" both accounts to 
Station Access, then you go billed for both Station Access fees in full. 
In other words, there is no way to just upgrade accounts to Station 
Access. If you are charged the $14.95 for each on the first of the 
month, for example, and decide on the third to change them to Station 
Access, you will be charged the full $29.95 for each account at that 
time (and your new monthly billing date will be the third from that 
point forward), thereby losing any value from your payments on the 
first. They do not pro-rate your previous charges. That is, unless they 
have changed it within the past six months or so. I actually spoke with 
a CSR on the phone and confirmed this at one point.
