==============

Cleric Solo Test (Brief)
Buffs = Blessing of Aegolism, Blessed Armor of the Risen, Aura of Battle.
Fought Blizzard Spiders in Velks.
Used summoned hammer.

My Stats while fighting:
3347hp
1162ac
784atk (852atk with Yaulp5)

Pulled spider with MoR, ran to corner. As spider runs in, cast MoK. Cast Yaulp and start
meleeing. Cast pet. Keep casting Yaulp as needed (18sec refresh time, 24sec length of
buff).

I didn't need to heal myself during either fight.

Fight 1
-------
Fight time = 2min 28sec (148 seconds)
Mob Damage to me = 2343
My Total Damage = 6530 (or 41.3 dmg/second)
- Melee Dmg = 835
- Bash Dmg = 179
- Pet Dmg = 2013
- MoR Dmg = 810
- Proc Dmg = 2692 (24 procs)
My Total Mana Spent = 940 (5 Yaulp Casts, Mor, Mok, Pet, and a CH after fight)

Fight 2
-------
Fight time = 2min 38sec (158 seconds)
Mob Damage to me = 3001
My Total Damage = 6528 (44.1 dmg/second)
- Melee Dmg = 1173
- Bash Dmg = 253
- Pet Dmg = 2612
- MoR Dmg = 960
- Proc Dmg = 1530 (15 procs)
My Total Mana Spent = 950 (5 Yaulp Casts, Mor, Mok, Pet, and a CH after fight)

Ok, so I'm not going to replace a Rogue in an experience group, but its a lot of fun
compared to medding and healing. At the end of these fights I CH'd myself for 2623 and
2352 and I had 3347hp total at the time. I ended each fight with 80% mana or so, so I
could probably do 3 or 4 of these without medding.


==============

40-44 DPS? Not too shabby.
