Or misinformed, which is also part of the strategy of deceiving your
enemy.

If your having fun while doing it then where's the loss?
This isn't like UO where you get ganked you lose stuff, not like EQ
where you spend hours on corpse recovery. You die, 3 minutes later
your on your way back. Ten minutes later your in the frontier and
fighting again.

Ok in one sentence you condemn hundreds of thousands of FPS, TFC, and
PvP players without even trying the games to learn about them. I
thought philosophers had to be open minded? Willing to see both sides
of the debate in order to more effectively win it? 

Don't you get it? There is no LOSS there. You die you return and try
again. You learn and get better and learn your teammates abilities and
tactics and learn to integrate them into a whole and one day it all
fits and your the flag runner, and just as your about to get waxed
your Heavy weapons man steps behind you and blocks, and you get the
flag home. And you high five each other in chat because you worked so
well together. And then you go get the next one. 

And some times it'll be your team fighting the glorious retreat
against teams with better players and your goal will simply be to hold
the line. And sometimes you won't even be able to do that. Sometimes
no matter what you do you can't stop them. Until you do..... just
once, and that turns things all around. 

Shit now I gotta go play some more TFC. :-)
