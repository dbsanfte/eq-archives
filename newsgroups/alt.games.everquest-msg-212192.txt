Lucy is just wonderful.

Level 53:
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM
Slot: PRIMARY
Skill: 2H Slashing Atk Delay: 44
DMG: 47 (50) Dmg Bonus: 21 AC: 14 (15)
DEX: +11 (+12) STA: +11 (+12) HP: +33 (+35) MANA: +33 (+35)
Recommended level of 56.
WT: 4.5 Size: LARGE
Class: WAR PAL RNG SHD
Race: ALL

Level 65:
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM
Slot: PRIMARY
Skill: 2H Slashing Atk Delay: 44
DMG: 50 Dmg Bonus: 45 AC: 15
DEX: +12 STA: +12 HP: +35 MANA: +35
Recommended level of 56.
WT: 4.5 Size: LARGE
Class: WAR PAL RNG SHD
Race: ALL

Those 3 points difference in damage count for 6 when hitting, the damage 
bonus difference is pretty hefty at 24.  So, looks like a difference of 
about 30 points per hit on average between level 53 and level 65.
