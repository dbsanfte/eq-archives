The price on this varies ridiculously.
To most players, the single charge on it doens't make it all that
attractive--not to mention that it's fairly common.  Hence the low
price.

However, people who routine raid uber-mobs, being able to DA is pretty
useful.  Lord knows pulling dragons that AoE without DA sucks much
ass.

Given this, these players with fairly deep bank accounts will shell
out several hundred plats without really thinking about it.
