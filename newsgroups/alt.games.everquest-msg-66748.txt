I've always thought that a rangers need a certain outdoor skill. Binding is
obviously a great thing to have, but it is never going to happen.
Rangers should be able to make a camp. Nothing special just a skill that
enables a ranger to build a small fire. Within the radius of the fire, there
is light, the fire as such removes all agro. Those mobs that do happen to
walk in, don't attack. Unless trained it, the fire will not save you from a
mob that has already agroed on you. The radius of the fire and the bonus it
gives gets bigger when your skill get's higher. Items should be added to the
game, such as matches or flint to spark the fire although at higher levels,
the fire bases spell will do the same. Sitting around the fire gives you a
healing bonus and a meditation bonus. This fire can only be made in outdoors
situations and in certain dungeons.
