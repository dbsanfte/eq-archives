So, because you can go back into the game you say it's not your ISP. Why 
can't the same thing be said for the Verant server? How come there are 
still other players on the same server? If it is Verant's fault why 
didn't the other players all go LD? Beyond the connection to your ISP 
there are lots of other nodes that are part of your ISP and other 
components that are not Verant's either. There are many pieces that make 
up the path from you to Verant.
