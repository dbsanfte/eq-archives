I got through most of 30 in and around SK, inside Splitpaw etc, and
kiting griffenes and griffins in NK. This meant I often got drops for
crafted armour quests, which I would do for xp and then sell the
proceeds. Crafted quests are great xp at level 30, but you need to have
enough disposable income to buy the expensive gems for them. I'm a
druid, but a ranger should just as easily be able to fear kite animals
like griffs.

Other options are places like Dalnir (bring you own group), or Iceclad
cougar-hunting (little to no loot, but good xp at 30). You can fear kite
the cougars if you pull them to the dock side of the igloo island and
they will run towards the water, rather than towards the cougar-filled
side of the island that would generate adds. Maybe a pathing exploit but
there you go... just get into a group and whack 'em normally if you feel
too guilty about this.

You might also try Crystal Caverns on Velious - just take care getting
there (camo a lot - not much in those parts sees invis), and bear in
mind its a fair way from a bind spot.
