    I'd be interested in seeing proof on this point, if it's possible. From
55 levels of playing my rogue and watching her max backstab, I would be
inclined to say the opposite - that the max possible backstab does go up
with ATK. I don't know of a good way to distinguish between "does go up" and
"there's an amazingly small chance of hitting the max at lower ATK", though.
I will point out that my rogue never hit her max backstab when at lower ATK
(than when she hit the max) while beating the heck out of greens in The
Warrens. That makes me think that it isn't just because of an increased
probability due to ATK vs. DEF of the mob, but an inherent property of ATK.
