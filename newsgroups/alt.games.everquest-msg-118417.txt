Cprince--

Be a better father and boogey monsters won't get your little girl.

Incidentally, I am working from the assumption that you are full of
shit, that you wrote everything posted here, and that you're now
trying to lay blame on what I hope is a fictitious child. If it's a
real child, shame on you twice.

Personally, I don't care if people buy accounts, equiptment, or
platinum from the game for real-life cash. There are plenty of idiots
in the game capable of getting my character killed, even though they
have earned everything in the game themselves. I was not a part of the
initial pile-on you got when you posted to this group.

Just so you fully understand why I am now convinced that you are an
enormous, steaming pile of shit, let me consider each possible reality
behind your situation:

(1) You are a child, posting from a parent's account. After numerous
reports to your parents' ISP, attempting to have your Internet access
cut off, you are trying to bluff your way out of the shit you so
richly deserve for getting your parents booted off of the Internet.

(2) You are an adult...or rather, of the age where the state considers
even braindead social retards like yourself an adult...and making up a
child to blame your own shortcomings on.

(3) You are of the age of majority for your state, do have a child,
and are now blaming her for your own actions.

(4) You're telling the truth. Rather than blaming your child for all
of the myriad faults she has demonstrated here including, but not
limited to unwillingness to live up to social and legal contracts,
preferring instead to yell at a group of strangers who treated her
like the adult she pretended to be.

So, while I am in favor of (1), possibly (2), but while I do not
definitively know what subcategory of shitpile you are, I can
definitely see the flies circling.
