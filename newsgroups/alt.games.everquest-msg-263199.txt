Ok.  Nodrop has less utility than droppable equipment with the same stats.
There's lots of useless stuff in the game.  Why is unused nodrop gear any
worse than, say, Phosphorous Powder, or L30 spells you scribed but no longer
use?  Just because it takes time to destroy it?

Some outlet would be fine, but it should be pretty low in value IMO.  Doing
things carefully is not Sony's strong point, though, and doing it badly
could cause a lot of harm.

It would be nice to have an outlet for other crap loot, too, and for obsolete
spells, and for tradeskill items used only for skillups, and for the 2 hours I
spent LFG, and for my belly-button lint.  Of course, if these items were
valuable, it changes the value of currently-valuable items.  It's not clear
that net fun increases, and I'm pretty sure it wouldn't for me.
