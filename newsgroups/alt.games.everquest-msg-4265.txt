    First I thought GREAT, now I would have to perform the tedious task
of making my own food.  A mind numbing thought when I looked at my lack
of available inventory slots.  Then I thought well, maybe I can make
some money on this.  I mean my brewing skill is high enough that I can
brew what I need for it.  But then I figured out that the trade skill
that I am weakest in, and have absolutely not desire to pursue, was
involved.  The dreaded blacksmithing skill.
    At that point I threw my hands up in despair and hung my head in as
I said to myself, "Well, carrying two stacks of muffins will not be that
bad."  I went the merchant to sell off my backing supplies when I
happened to see some player made food, not the stuff you normally see,
but something that required a little more skill then fish cakes.  I
right clicked on it to see if it would be a snack or a meal, and that is
when I saw how nutritious it was, in fact it was so nutritious it had
stat modifying properties.
     And now I am off to raise that dreaded blacksmithing skill.  At
last a reason to stay home and bake.

Now in simple english.  It was beer braised rat (might have been wolf,
but definitely beer braised) +2 dex -1 int.  Bought it, but have not had
a chance to use it yet.  Beer braised I believe hits trivial around 50,
just think of what some of the harder recipes might yield.
