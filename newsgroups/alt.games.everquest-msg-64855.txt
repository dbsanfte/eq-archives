I do know one guy who only plays EQ maybe 4 or 5 hours a month.  But
he only does that because me and the rest of my friends make him play
most of the time.  :-)

I see no reason why people couldn't play EQ without SoL.  Hell, I did
for better than two years, and showed no signs of quitting anytime
soon.  The engine update and new graphics are nice, but hardly
required to play the game.

True, true.  But, I was needling out at about 6gigs on mine with just
Win2K, EQ, Deus Ex, and some music.  Just felt confined, which is
funny since I can remember trying to figure out how the hell I was
going to fill up the first 500mb harddrive I ever got.  :-)

I know, I was just nitpicking.  I'm running Win2K (that's just because
I'm in the process of getting my MCSE for Win2K) and I have yet to
find a game I can't play under it, but I do know people who have.

>Windows95 just can't cut it for gaming anymore.

There is really no reason to put Win95 on ANY machine, unless it's
someone your really, really hate.  And even then, there are just some
things that your shouldn't do to even your worst enemy out of simple,
human decency.
