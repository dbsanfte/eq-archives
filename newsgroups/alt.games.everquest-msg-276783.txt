No worries; the impersonal nature of text-only has led to many
misinterpretations and misunderstandings throughout the history of
usenet.  I'm sure this won't be the last, either.

At any rate, you expressed interest in alternatives to glasses.  I
myself also wear corrective lenses, so I do understand the problem.
Fortunately, many solutions exist, including but not limited to clip-on
anaglyph lenses and, my preferred, oversized anaglyph glasses that
simply fit on over ones regular glasses.  Most stores selling anaglyph
filters offer both solutions.  I would have recommended where I bought
mine, but it was so long ago and the number of sites selling from a
google search are so numerous I did not feel qualified to directly
answer that portion of the question directly.

I don't like the clip-on anaglyph filters as much as the over-sized
glasses.  Clip-ons are usually borderless, and thus tend to let a lot
of external light in through the sides.  I have the same problem with
clip-on sunglasses.  So, unless you're very good at touch-typing (I
can't touch-type to save my life, despite having been working with
computers since the early 80's) and play in a completely darkened room,
I do not recommend this solution.

Most anaglyph glasses seem to be oversized anyhow, my personal
favorites being the ones with thick plastic frames.  These do a
fantastic job of blocking peripheral light, allowing my eyes to better
adjust to the red-blue filters.

One thing I should also probably note is that most anaglyph lenses are
actually red-cyan filters, not actually red-blue.  This is not usually
a problem, as the NVidia drivers output red-cyan images.  However some
anaglyph vendors have specific red-blue filters; these will not work as
well as standard red-cyan filters, and if you adjust the NVidia's
anaglyph output to use red-blue instead of red-cyan, the colors become
seriously messed up when actually viewing the 3D image.  Looks like
16-color or somesuch.

A final thing I should probably note are in-game colors and anaglyph.
Before using any anaglyph setup, make sure none of your text messages
are in either the red or blue spectrum, or you will have a difficult
time reading it.  Also, the red and blue targetting rings will look
funky, with green and light-blue being difficult to discern.  And any
area that uses inordinate ammounts of red, such as many of the inns in
the human cities, or blue, like much of the water, will be difficult to
maintain the 3D illusion.  There's also often some bleedover between
the overlain images, as neither the monitors colors nor the anaglyph
filters are ever perfect, resulting in some ghosting of certain
objects, usually bright objects such as light-sources.

Despite those few, really minor IMO, flaws, it's still quite an
experience to look out across the vast Karana plains, out over the
Commons valley, down into the pit, over the Field of Bone, up at any
one of the numerous spires, and really get a feel for the size of the
place that you just don't get from a purely 2-dimensional view. And
then some Kunark goblin gets all in your face and your like "RAWRG! Get
back on that side of the glass, stupid goblin! No, don't you- don't you
dare slobber on my keyboard! Back you vile thing, BACK! Stop licking
me! AUGH!"
