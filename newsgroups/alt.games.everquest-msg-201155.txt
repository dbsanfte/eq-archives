It's not broken.  Here is how it happens.  As soon as you kill the named, a
few "defenders" will spawn.  They will be named so and they will be outside
the camp.  Now these defenders need to be killed in order for the takeover
to occur.  If you don't kill the "defenders" then the tribe will always beat
back any assault.  As soon as you kill the defenders though the attacking
tribe automatically takes over.  So what you need to do is only kill the
"defenders" when the right assault is coming.  I.E. if you want the wolves
to take over then you wait till they mount an attack at the camp you want
them to win over.  Kill the "defenders" at that camp and presto automatic
takeover
