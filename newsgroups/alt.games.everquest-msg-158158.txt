It's really not as bad as some people on this board are making it out
to be. There is something for everyone in PoP. The Plane of Knowledge
alone is worth the price of the expansion.

1. Trainers for all classes. ALL races/classes are welcome. No faction
issues.
2. Tradeskill supply vendors
3. ALL (or at least most) vendor sold spells in one location (the
great library)
4. Instant-Ports to all major cities

It all but eliminates travel problems (corpse runs, waiting for boats,
etc)  for all non-binding non-gating classes. It addresses one of the
biggest complaints casual gamers have, and that is by the time they
get to a zone to group/fight in they have wasted most of their
evenings play time. Or worse, they spend all of their evenings play
time on a corpse run.

Is PoP a grab for money on Sony's part? You Bet!!

Does the arbitrary decision to made the new Raid system PoP only suck?
You Bet!! (but not surprising when you look at features tied directly
to the previous 3 expansions)

Is EQ a better and more fun game than it was prior to Pop? In my
opinion YES!
