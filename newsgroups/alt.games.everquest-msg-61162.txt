Monks through 50 make a pretty acceptable alternative tank to a warrior and
easily out-tank all but the best equipped shadowknights and paladins.  Above
50 shadowknights and paladins move ahead of monks in tanking, but that
doesn't make a *properly* equipped monk a bad tank.  I've tanked for 6-man
grinds in Kael arena, tanked in Hate, tanked in Fear, tanked in Chardok,
tanked in ToV even.

Anything that can be killed by a 6-man group, a monk can tank.  I don't lose
hitpoints any faster than a warrior (though I do lose them in large chunks
while going large parts of the fight without actually taking any damage).
The main adjustment to having a monk tank is handled by the healers. 
Complete heal on a monk isn't always the #1 option like it is on a warrior. 
Enchanters also have to adjust, mainly by liberal use of root.

Now, *particularly* in duo hunting, a monk probably makes the absolute best
tank.  In a duo the tank will also be pulling, and undeniably monk rules
there, able to abort a pull that would be too hard for the duo.  Damage
output of a monk isn't even touched by any "better" tank, and faster kills
means less damage taken.  Monks all around just make the best tanks for a
duo.
