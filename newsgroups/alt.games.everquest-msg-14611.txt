From the original post:
FYI, we also consider using tanks and casters with invulnerable
disciplines/spells up versus proximity mobs to be an "Itzploit".

I'm making up my own mind based on the information provided. *IF* all
the VI is claming happened, actually did happen, then I would *STILL*
maintain the punishment was too severe.

You have to ask yourself this question:
If VI CS reps had the opportunity to watch this whole event happening,
why did they wait until the raid was aborted before revealing their
presence?


Also, compare the 2 sides to the story. CQ stated their side right from
the start, and have remained firm in their version of events. Time and
again, the VI side has contained errors, GM conjecture, and accusations
of things which they later retract. The PLAYERS are telling the
DESIGNERS how *their* game works for goodness' sake.

Using res effects to prevent the AE may be cheesy, but there are plenty
of precedents for spell stacking issues being both witnessed and even
lauded by GMs. CoH is a valid tactic to clear agro. LoS avoidance of AE
spells is also valid. 

IMO, the whole argument for banning revolves around 'safe spot'
exploitation:

VI: "We later went into the zone and were able to find a spot under the
bridge where the NPC wouldn't summon you but also wouldn't hit you for
significant periods of time (it would occasionally become 'unstuck' and
resume summoning)."

also IMO the fact that it wasn't mentioned ONCE in-game (either in
/tell, /guild, /shout, /group etc) leads me to believe that even if
there WAS a safe spot, CQ didn't know about it and didn't use it to
their advantage.

CQ: "If you found the existence of such a location, I commend you, but
we had, and still have no idea where such a place is. As you will see by
our guild chat, there was at no time any instruction given to anyone to
"stand RIGHT HERE and don't move", or "Stay on the safe spot" or
anything of that nature


It's all very well being 'gad' they've been banned for exploiting, but
what exactly were the exploiting and was it deserving of the punishment.
VI though they deserved what the got and read off a list of charges.
Most of those charges they've been found 'not guilty' on, yet VI seem to
be clinging on to the same punishment, and looking more and more
desperate all the time
