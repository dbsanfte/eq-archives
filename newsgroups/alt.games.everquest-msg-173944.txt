Err thats mob level 51 not your level would think that was obvious.
Was level 57 last time I did any swarm kiting and worked on things
below that mark. 

As for Cha it does affect it about as much as str affects damage on a
warrior. So matters somewhat but not a ton, know that Swarm kiting is
easier above 160cha than below it. Otherwise level difference between
you and mob matters most.
