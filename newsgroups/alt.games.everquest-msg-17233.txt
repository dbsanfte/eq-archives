Not that I'm really following this thread, nor am I going to read it again, I
just thought I would point something out....

You do not own the game... Verant does.  By purchasing the software yo agree to
a set of terms with them.  You may actually, phsyically have the software in
your hands, but know what?  Verant/Sony can request that box back at any time,
for any reason.

Read your EULA.
