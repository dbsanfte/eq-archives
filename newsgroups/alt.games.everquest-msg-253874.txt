I wouldn't say they're dated at all anymore .. with the recent dx9
upgrade and other effect upgrades i think EQ looks quite ok in 2004 :)

Try going back to 800x600 UO if you want to see dated :)

Whoever is designing EQ really knows what they're doing. The game is
just so well done in so many aspects.

I've played/tried a lot of mmorpg's.. UO was really great, all the
rest sucked. Played SWG for about 6 months but it's gameplay just
seemed to be lacking something.
