Up to you, but I would have made absolutely sure that he knew what he was
doing. Perhaps he isn't familar with weapon ratios--I know there are some nice
"velium axes" that aren't actually called that. Rations of 32/40 and such.
Anyway, it seemed to me, that the "I send the guy a tell asking if he was sure
that was what he wanted" was a bit of self-justification. I'd offer him a
refund. Obviously, he thought it was worth that much--a simple offer of 100
plat would have gotten it as quickly as 800 in auction, if he needed it for a
quest or what-not. It sort of seems like you cheated him--IE, you knew it
wasn't worth that much and didn't tell him. It's up to you, though, of course.

What is up with "LA!~"? Once, after a korean  (or la user) got mad at me, and I
called him an ass in shout, he kept saying "NO CUSSING PLZ  THX LA!~"..now,
it's sort of a joke in my guild to use the phrase when someone "cusses" in
guild chat.
