I wholeheartedly disagree.

The con system is supposed to give you an idea as to how you would fare
against the mob you're conning.  It worked as advertised at the lower
levels, but now it's become totally misleading.

Case in point:  Last night I was learning my way around Lower Guk - Live
Side.  I had just crossed over to the Dead Side and was exploring around a
little when a Froglok vis Shaman agro'd on me.  I backed up to the spot
where I first entered the area, where there were a couple of other players
camping, and I prepared to take on the little bugger - it conned green and
dubious, but said I should be able to win.  I had just enough time to snare
it while it dotted me and advanced on me.  I started fighting it, but when
it hit me it whacked me for about 3/4 bub of health - EACH HIT!   Needless
to say, I was in serious trouble.  Tried to root it and kept getting
interrupted.  Luckily the other players nearby stepped in and took care of
it for me while I was trying to heal myself up.  It had me down to half my
hitpoints and I had only done about 20% damage to it.  If it weren't for the
other players there, I would have had another frustrating XP loss - probably
would have donged back to 50 - not to mention a nice corpse run.  All this
from a single GREENIE!!!

Now, I don't have any problem with the game being tougher - in fact I want
it to be.  What fun is it if there's no challenge?  What I DO have a problem
with is the way the cons have CHANGED as I advance in levels.  If they are
even going to have a con system then it needs to be CONSISTENT throughout
the game!  This idea that after 30 the con's are for "groups" as opposed to
"solo" is horses*it!  Neither the manual nor the tutorial or anything else
I've read from Verant indicates that this is the case.
The idea that the game is geared for grouping is fine - but don't shove it
down my throat.  I always prefer to hunt in a group, but at this level
grouping is getting more and more difficult.  Either you have to spend an
hour or more waiting around, pleading for someone to invite you in - or
you're SOL.  So where's the fun in that?

This game has gone from a pleasurable escape from the daily hassles of the
real world to an exercise in frustration.
And that's not what a GAME is supposed to be.
Something has to be done about this or I'm giving up on EQ and moving on to
the Dark side as most of my guild has already done.  The way I feel about EQ
right now I wouldn't lose one bit of sleep over breaking my agreement with
Verant and selling my accounts to anyone who would want them.  As far as I'm
concerned, Verant broke the agreement by essentially lying to me with this
bogus con system.

Bottom line - if it can kill me, the con should indicate this and I should
get XP for it if I get lucky and win the fight.
