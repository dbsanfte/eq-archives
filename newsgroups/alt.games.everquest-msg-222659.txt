What if GM owned the roads. What if they could block your efforts from 
building a better automobile by not letting you use those roads. Or 
modifying the roads as soon as you released your vehicle, and 
simultaneously upgrading all GMs... leaving you to scramble for a month 
to modify your vehicle to work again, meanwhile your customers are 
stranded?? This is why open standards are so important. New vendors are 
blocked from even entering the market... and if they do manage to get in 
they are at the mercy of Microsoft changing the rules on them.

A better OS is insufficient to win marketshare at this point.

Microsoft 'runs the world', to compete you *have to play in their 
playground* which means you must interoperate with Microsoft. Who can 
better interoperate with Microsoft than Microsoft (especially when 
proprietary apis, protocols, etc are involved).

You wouldn't be thinking about 'disc brakes' and 'turbos' if you didn't 
have them either. Who knows how much innovation has been stopped dead in 
its tracks by this virtual monopoly??

> My OS works fine.

Windows is a piece of crap. If it works fine, then your expectations 
have been shamefully degraded by good marketing and years of 'minor 
improvements' over something that was even worse. :)

We all do.
