   Blizzard said that Death Knight can both tank and dps.
   But the fact is Death Knight cant use a shield!
   More and more players are paying attention on the dps Death
Knight.there are 3 different talent trees: blood, frost and unholly.
Who should do what damage in what order is a very touchy subject that
ends up causing a lot of arguments.Durling TBC, among the dps classes
in a raid, none should be double any of the others, and ideally nobody
is 50% ahead of anyone else.(well, if the players have the same level
items. Expect some crazy guys who have spent tons of wow gold to
upgrade their items. The recipe of =93Gloves of Immortal Dusk=94 on some
realms will charge over 10000 wow gold.)
The design of LK, even more so than BC, is that the different dps
specs are very close in potential. Overall, Blood, Frost and Unholy
should do the same damage. Because of the kinds of damage they do, it
probably won't even out on any single fight, but overall that's the
goal.
   Don't look at the data parse, the skill of the player and the
specific encounter are quite different. If you wanna be the VIP in
dps, as I mentioned, find out a cheap gold site,purchase some wow gold
there.

analysis.
