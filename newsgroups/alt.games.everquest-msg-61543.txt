Hehe, i think i spend 30 min figuring out how to read a book first time 
i needed it. Tried to help a poor ogre warrior figuring out what was in 
the book some char had sold him, book was in elvish.


And since i had Velious installed the LAST thing i tried was to go to 
the windowed mode to read it.
