Rangers like all characters go through their stages where they just totally
suck to play.  At level 35 you are leaving one of those stages IMHO.  At
level 35 you should now be realizing that for the next 20 levels or so you
can be a solo king if you choose.  Much of the stuff in DSP and OT is still
a viable target for you and can be feared.  It is so much fun to snare, fear
and chase the mob down slowly chopping him to nothingness.  The levels will
come fast and furious.... next place for this technique is Jagged Pines and
I personally stayed there (except for raids) until level 53.  Griffawns,
griffons and anacondas wooohooooo.  In the higher levels you get EQ and AM3
which are still huge damage dealers.   Every class has a down side from what
I have heard and go through  a period where getting the levels to do the
"cool" stuff is work...I think that is why they call it GRINDING.  Good luck
stick with it.
