This is some of the best advice anyone could give you. Last night, I was
in GFay with one of my alts (A level 5 Mage) and I saw this Wizard
running by with a name I recognized. I ran into him a LOOOONG time ago
with my Druid when it was just a baby and he was very helpful. So, as he
was running by, I hailed him and asked him (in BIG TIME RP mode) if he
could help me break the bandit spawn I was at. Well, not only did he do
that, but his son was on and brought his monk over to help. So there was
me (level 5 mage) and a level 4 monk fighting these bandits, while this
level (37 I believe) Wizard was single pulling them for us. DEFINITELY
an awesome night and I wouldn't have ever asked him had I not known who
he was.
