This is an important question for anyone who uses the mouse but can't 
press keyboard keys.

I would think it would be an accessibility issue ('ya gotta have it so 
the disabled and handicapped people can play and it makes everyone 
else's life easier too).

On the old interface this worked.  I had set up a hotkey for the 
inventory screen and found that it carried forward.  In the new 
interface you can't create one, so my new characters don't have one. 
But the old characters have one, it's just called "Menu Button" but it 
still works.

I checked my .ini files and didn't find anything that looks useful, so I 
think it's in a .opt file that I can't read or modify.  Perhaps someone 
who understands the formats of these files can help.
