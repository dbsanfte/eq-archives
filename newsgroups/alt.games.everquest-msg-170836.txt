Did you think you could just snip out the offending text, and not be held
accountable for it?  I'll take the liberty of putting back in what you've
snipped out:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
>  How many know that they are only 90% effective
>against HIV?

This is straight from Rush Limbaugh isn't it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whether or not you have done so in other post, I really don't care.  You did
it here.  If you can't even have the decency to allow me the dignaty of
holding my own opinions and beliefs, I'm through with this.  Post what you
want, I really don't give a damn.  Just don't expect a response from me.
Maybe you can invent dialog for me so you can better set up your strawmen.
