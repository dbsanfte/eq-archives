1 Choke landed per target would provide the obligatory damage to get
kill credit.

lol  It'd be hard enough getting a choke off while being beaten on,
those forever-and-a-day to cast Enchanter nukes wouldn't have much
more chance than the proverbial snowball in hell.

That'd at least be an attempt at a class relevant player skill.  :-p

/boggle
Oh yeah, I forgot, you obsess over min/maxing.  There's no chance
you'd be seen screwing around anywhere you couldn't totally control
the situation after one or two tactical refinements.  Just FYI, mez
is a flat-out life saver for the low level Enchanter exploring the
limits of his class solo at low levels.  It's also useful for doing
deliberate multi-pulls in groups, at least it is once you get the
second spell in the line (the 48 second one).

Tash is excellent for solo pulling at 12+ if you're using Jabober
to tank.  It's worth far more to get the mob slowed asap than to
pull with a DoT or nuke and have the mob kill your poor pet before
you can stick a slow to it.

Slightly OT, can you (or anybody else) explain why it is that Shaman
keep hasting my Druid in groups?  My latest theory is that they're
jealous of my 1337 healing skilz so they're trying to lure me into
melee where I'll die.  :-p

Of course, it's not exactly difficult for an Enchanter to befriend
Paladins and Clerics.

Whirl gets broken by melee (just like mez) which makes it little more
than a toy (do DoT/DD damage break Whirl?  if not that would give it
at least a little use).

Seems like most of the meaning has been drained out of the word
friend these days.

Don't you think that's mostly perception?  I certainly knew a lot
less about the game "back in the day", which made my standard of
cluefullness back then a lot lower than it is now.
