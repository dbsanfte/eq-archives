The problem with making it loop is there is no way to break the cycle,
and you can't do anything while the macro is in charge.

I do have this as my healing hot key:

/g Healing %T
/cast 1
/doablity 1 (sense heading)
/cast 1

Which immediately re-casts the spell in case the first one fizzles.

If I want to heal immediately, I just push the button again.
