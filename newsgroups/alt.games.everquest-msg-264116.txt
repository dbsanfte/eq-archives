Oh there's lots of excuses yes.

Nothing stopping them munging their address or indeed using a disposable
hotmail address in conjunction with their actual name putting them in
category 1.

Personally I've been using this alias since long before I started
reading usenet much less posting to it so i'm comfortable using it.
The same alias is used _everywhere I post_ and the address is real.

Spam is irrelevant - I get about one piece of spam every 4-5 days.
That's not what gets sent to me, that's the one of hundreds or thousands
that slips through the filters.

What other reasons are there for them to "protect their main email
address", once spam and kooks are filtered out?
