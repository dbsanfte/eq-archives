    Bah, it was only ten folks. We had someone "get too close, I wanted to
see her pet" with an aggro'ed Tunare recently. With PoG still partially
popped. And when they started taking damage, they didn't say what had
happened fast enough before heals landed on them. Not only were most of us
wiped out, not only did some people go LD when they died and not get back on
until the next day (when they had to attempt a CR from a fully-popped PoG
with their corpses close to Tunare's tree), but when Tunare went back to her
tree she instead depopped. After we'd cleared PoG three times in the past
three days (she was very, VERY late popping), she despawned. We're still
talking to the GMs about it. That is a "REALLY impressive scale".

    Remember, folks do have free will. If they really thought it was
hopeless and you were a moron, they would have left. And your raid did
succeed, after a bit of zerging. Thing'll be fine.

    Lord, how? Chain-ressing her back to meat shield you? As for the others,
well, four deaths stings, but with 90% resses each time you're looking at
40% of an unressed death. I'd be surprised if you couldn't get that back in
two hours.

    We beat AoW last night on the second try, after wiping the first. Having
half our clerics get mod rods *handed* to them mid-fight when the leader
called for rods to be dropped did not help us one bit, especially
considering that for AoW we have something like an eight cleric CHeal
rotation with two seconds between casts. On the second attempt, with all the
clerics having turned off trades :-P , we had the AoW down to no red showing
when he started summoning enchanters and druids. We were all spamming any
heals we had on the one warrior we'd found that was still alive, and half
the clerics were shouting in our heal channel "OOM" or "LAST HEAL". And he
dropped. I'd like to think it was the damage shields on the druids that were
getting summoned. :-)

> We won. But what a fucking cost.

    See above. Two hours of grinding and everyone will be back the way they
were. Heck, if you'd had the time you could have taken them down into the
basement and gotten back the XP that night.

    Wait until you start killing things you've never done before, the
serious things. I watched one guild wipe to Velketor eight or nine times in
a row before they finally dropped him, each time modifying their strategy a
little to take into account what they learned. The people that raid with you
need to learn to expect to die. And listening to you talk about how much you
regret them dying, well, I doubt they could be in better hands. I've had our
guild leader train us with the same four mobs, time after time, knowing all
the clerics would be wiped out but that each time we'd kill one of the mobs
and be able to eventually advance down the hallway we were in. I ate four
deaths there, but we got down the hallway. Where we wiped twice to the mob
at the end of it. :-/
