Was under the impression it still run opengl. Ok - well that means I got
direct 3d problems with EQ. I am getting major stuttering running on Radeon
9700 pro only in everquest. Got Athlon XP 3000+ and 1024 mb ram - and im
getting stuttering! (. Very weird as I have Radeon 7500 PCI in same machine
and it runs eq fine (if a bit slow) - don't suppose anyone knows the answer
to 9700 probs???
