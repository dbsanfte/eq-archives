I wonder what ratio of the traditional soloers you mention are
KEI/Virtue (etc) addicts?

Bards - Can be 75% effective naked with a hand drum
Druids - Root/DoT/Med and self buff
Shamans - Root/DoT/Med and self buff
Necros - Trade HPs for Mana and lifetap
Mages/BL - rely mostly on thier pets
Wizards (never really a "soloing" class until hitting mid-30s and
quading...too much downtime to be efficient) - The ONLY class that
"needs" KEI to offset downtime when solo 

I really don't see where the soloing classes in EQ are crippled by the
removal of high level mega-buffs. They are merely slowed down to
pre-mega-buff soloing.

Classes that could be turned into soloers by mega-buffs are the ones
that are hurt the most. The fact that a non-soloing class could solo
with these buffs is a clear indication of just how unbalancing the
loop-hole was.
