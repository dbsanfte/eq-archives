Hmmm bread type foods are generally +mana +int, since it's apparently 
the exceptional combine of banana bread, I'd imagine it would have some 
+mana regen while resting and do away with the obligitory negative dex 
or agi.

Given the apparent difficulty in obtaining bananas (they are not on the 
AH at all, much like dragon meat for Dragon Steaks) I'd probably guess 
somewhere around +70 mana, +6 int, and probably +5 mana regen while resting.
