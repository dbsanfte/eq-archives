Ive noticed a disturbing trend in the "next generation" of MMORPGS.
Ive beta tested several recently, and am really suprised at some of
the design decisions that many have made.

In this current day of age of on-line gaming, the competition for our
gaming dollars is increasing and within a few years, we, the consumer,
will have so many choices of how we wish to spend our online time. The
games that will last will be the ones that hold as many players
attention for the longest time.

So why are so many up and coming games limiting their designs around
particular play styles?

It seems so many new games about to hit the market are focusing their
efforts on the concept that the only method of item acquisition is
through trade skills. Im currently beta testing a game (name witheld
due to NDA) that staunchly refuses to have items drop on mobs. What
they do drop are "tradeskill recipies". So that zombie you defeated
(who appears to have a weapon in hand) drops the blueprints to make a
tasty cake. ?????? Come again? Am I the only one who finds this
ludricrous? Knowing that I will never defeat a foe and receive a
decent reward really takes the wind out of my sails. I have few
options here. Either take the recipe and try to hunt down someone who
can create something nice from it... or grind through the process of
getting to the point where I can make it myself (which is not my idea
of a grand adventure standing around an anvil for hours on end) or
just buy the object from another player.

Hey i have no problems with tradeskills, they offer a good alternative
to hunting, but if thats the only way to get "rewarded" in a game, Ill
pass.

Whats wrong with catering to different playstyles? In EQ there are so
many options. I can stand around that anvil and pound away if I like
to get something decent. I can grab some friends and defeat foes to
get an item. I can go quest for something. Or even go spend my hard
earned plat in the bazaar. EQ doesnt force you down 1 road, it gives
you options. Even at launch back in march 99 you had these options
(although tradeskills seemed an afterthough at the time and took years
to flesh out, it was still an option).

When theres so much competition now (and ALOT more in the near future)
it doesnt make sense to me to focus your gameplay on one segment of
the player base.

Ive been trying to figure out why they've made these decisions.
Perhaps its to prevent frustrations over camping issues. Some of the
frustrations in the past with camping items have been either kill
stealers or the length of time required to receive an item from a
camp. Whats interesting about the game im currently testing is that
kill stealing will still be a problem. There are no mechanics to
prevent it at all. You get xp based on how much damage you do to the
creature... period. Nothing will stop anyone from whacking on your mob
and taking xp from your kill. Heck, due to lag, you can inadvertantly
engage someone elses mob and accidentally KS someone. Whats going to
stop the griefers? As for the length of time to acquire an item, I
dont see player made stuff any less frustrating. You still have to
amass the gold (or plat or whatever) to be able to afford the item.
With a camp, you can get lucky and maybe get it within a reasonable
amount of time. Then I guess theres the concept of camp hoarding,
which the system in this game doesnt solve either. The better stuff is
made from rare resources that can be dominated/controlled by a group
of people as well.

I guess my point is that no one option will solve all the problems
that plague online gaming. Only diversity solves these issues. When
you have many options to choose from, there are less bottlenecks to
your gaming experience.
