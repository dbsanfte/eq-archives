Just got done watching the EQ bit on 48 hours, and I realize that it's all
Sony's fault that I'm not married!  If my fiance' and I hadn't have had to
spend all this money to upgrade BOTH our systems so that we could both play
EverQuest, we could be out of debt by now and have afforded a wedding!

Damn you, EverQuest!!
