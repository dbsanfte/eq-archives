}Yes, I'm positive. My wife is a shaman and we love Bi'Lah for the +atk. 
}Garou strips it.

Oh, +ATK, that would explain it.  But you might wanna know...

Bih'li Sow + Atk (15)
Boon   Ugly + Atk (40) + Dex (100) + lifetap proc.

A lot of folks still hate the way their screen bounces up and down, and 
they can't slam, and you can only keep it up continuously on one person, 
or about 7/8 of the time on two people.  But it's more ATK. :)

Again, good to know, I'd hate to accidentally snare someone with it. :)
