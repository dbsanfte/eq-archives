Well, you didn't say anywhere in your message that I saw that you guys
verified she was there at the start.  BUT, let's assume you weren't too
stupid to check first.

Assuming the rest of your story is true, this paragraph is likely false.
Your guildmate was probably an asshole and seriously abusive.  It doesn't
excuse what the GM did, of course, but if the GM got THAT mad at one of your
guildies, that guildy has to be like the worst asshole on the server.

Yeah, hope you told that to your guildmate as well.
