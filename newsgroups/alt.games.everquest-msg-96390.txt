I didn't mind floating for a long time...then I hated it.  Recently I've
gotten adjusted to the bobbing motion and I don't really care, as long as
there's no pool swimming or climbing over things to be done.  My main is a
gnome, and SOE is a great spell, but if I'm in Chardok and have to zone out
I have to dump it because I haven't figured out how to get up a big step
without jumping.
