Recentley joined a raid guild, happens to be with some old friends from my
original server (plus many others I dont know).

Basically a mid tiered guild, probably best described as a hybrid guild
(raid every other day, raiding is not compulsory but is a primary focus).

We are doing demiplane right now, we've just killed Sullon and will soon be
breaking into DK.

Having been away for a year or more, my most recent raiding was in PoP,
while they were fun fights, they are vastly different to demiplane.

Some fight in demi plane seem very dull, and the whole getting ae'd / snared
/ dotted until you get blockers is kind of annoying, and I see little
purpose in that.

Anyway, the events I have taken part in this week are Granite smash (basic
mob, despawns at 50%, has knockback ae, and a DT dot, he is usually known as
Thulli I believe).

He is not too hard, as long as the curers are quick, as sometimes many
people can be hit with the DT.

After him, there is Sanguinus the Redfang, who spawns after killing a
certain bat, casts ae silience, and spawns various adds, he wasn't too
difficult as long as adds are taken care off quickly.

Next up was sisters.....this is probably the stupidiest event I have yet
done, you get a wave of weak adds at the start, keep some bats mezzed /
offtanked, while a few people talk to the sisters for around 20mins.  I did
win some gloves for one dkp here so I cant complain too much, and I'm hoping
for the bow at some point also.

My favourite fight so far in DP is Hatchet, this guy can be a sod, he has
various emotes, which you have to duck, run out of range of his axe, go
between his legs, or kite him.

The first three will just result in your death if you pay no attention, the
fourth, if you screw up, can wipe your entire raid (AE DT anyone?).  This
was my second time doing this event, the first I died a couple of times once
due to DT, the second due to adds with no buffs.  The second time I did it,
I was doing fine, but then missed an emote (only have kite one on voice
filter), mainly because the demiplane spam also goes to other, and is also
yellow text, this I should of ducked but didnt :P  Either way he went down
eventually.

Devlin is an interesting fight, he changes his weapons and does different
things depending on what he equips, the worst for the raid was probably the
vials, as if he throws at the melee, usually the amount of bodies prevents
people from picking up vials (though I had no problems), you also get Mayong
bane weapons from his spirit at the end.

So one upgrade from these fights for me, also this week I managed to score
an aug from Sullon's domain (did it with a group, is fairly hardcore, alot
of death, but worth it), Keldo's offhand (mace of tortured nightmares), and
anguish ranger arms.  So all in all, for 1 dkp spent this week, I did ok :)

Looking to reflag the last few for DK on sunday night, and probably kill
Tris and Mayong again, and start raiding DK next week (along with guarenteed
DP kills).
