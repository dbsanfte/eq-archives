I never go anonymous, mostly because I'm making *stupid* money out of
port requests. As I hardly ever group, I don't mind stopping for a few
minutes to port someone and make a few plat. Then again, I do have a
firm policy: Free for corpse recoveries, 20pp if it's just saving shoe
leather.

I have noticed, though, that as a human, I get a lot fewer requests than
Halflings do. With my leathers and the Staff of the Observers, I look
like a monk. :)
