As far as I can tell, the Emperor is on Beta Neutral faction and hunting
Spectrals won't hurt you.  As for the Hunter and Forager, go to TT and see
if a group is huntung rares.  If you find one, chances are, they're letting
many many medallions rot.  Simply ask if you can loot a set, and chances
are, they'll let you.  They'll also let you loot the bow that thet Hunter
and Forager drop, which isn't spectacular, but isn't bad.  You'll need IU to
get to the emperor though.
