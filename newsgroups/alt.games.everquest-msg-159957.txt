Incidentally, I hit 39 (and 40, barely) on the weekend) so had
a chance to try some tactics here... this was with a pickup group
in DL. Two pickup groups, two levels, two days. With a raid
tossed in.

The other thing I found useful was DA/DB... sometimes I
found I *had* to cast a heal which risked aggro, to make sure
the tank stayed alive, and in those cases I DAed when the
MOBs came running. And *didn't* run myself until I thought the
tank had aggro back.

I love DA. :-) Fast, cheap and effective.

OK thanks, I'll keep that in mind.

I'm finding now that SHeal is about 30%; I hit CHeal at 30%
HP so they're healed at 20%. With CHeal I can keep up
with the tanks and only need med breaks for buffing. With
SHeal there was *no* chance. The biggest problem I'm seeing
*now* is that mana was sitting at the "edge" all the time. (i.e.
CHeal takes me to 5% mana). However, I'm also keeping the
tanks apprised of this, so I figure if they're willing to take the
risk...

I suppose that ultimately the aim is either "gain exp/loot as
quickly as possible" or a described aim (i.e. a raid) -- or
just to have fun, of course, although groups where "fun" is
the *main* aim seem pretty rare. High returns requiring high
risks, I suppose, but it always seems unfair that the tanks are
almost always the ones taking the exp hit.

I think this happened last thing last night - tank went
from 40% HP to dead *very* quickly (1 tank, 2
MOBs at this point) - one of the MOBs was a drachnid
caster, so I suspect he was nuked. Then the druid got
pounded on, so I told him to run... rooted and atoned the
two MOBs, medded and rezzed the tank. (Then went and
rezzed the druid; he was killed by the guards at KC *after*
returning from KC zone.)

I'm finding that already. :-(

Heck, my guild pulled me for a 45+ raid as soon
as I hit 39...

I'm finding that the best mix is to keep *both* SHeal and CHeal
when I can. CHeal most of the time, but SHeal for when the tank
needs healing *urgently*. Plus GHeal on the side for maintenance
and casters. So my grouped mix yesterday was:
1. SHeal
2. GHeal
3. DA
4. DB
5. Root
6. Atone
7. CHeal
8. Gate
with Atone getting swapped out for buffs.

True - I'm still using GHeal for self-heals, mostly. I try not to
get hurt enough for SHeal to be worthwhile. :-) (And if I
do, I practice Bind Wounds if soloing, which gives me
*something* to do, even if it's almost completely useless for
a cleric.)

I've had a few tanks say they preferred Valor, but never
understood why, given that Verant decided in their wisdom
that Skin overwrites Valor.

But thanks for the advice; I'll do some reading up on the
Druid buff line and see how they compare... I usually have
Valor up when a Druid Skins me, so the lack of a healing
effect isn't very evident.

Currently I'm casting the heal and doing a "/g CHeal inc" manually.
And/or "/g Expect CHeal during/after next MOB". Still tuning my
hotkeys.

I've been trying to judge when the MOB has a bit over
10 seconds to live and casting then. I need more practice on that. :-)
That's been working reasonably well except when there's a nuker
in the group.

Of the plans you suggest...
- ML sounds like a good idea and is middling-common from
what I've heard. I saw some discussion of this on Casters Realm.
- Requiring tanks to provide peridots... probably not going to
happen. Due to timezone issues (plus being in a smallish guild) I
don't think I've *ever* been in a guild group for XP.
- Trash loot - could work, but needs a good definition of "trash"
- Guild supplies peridot - definitely not going to happen; small guild,
and I mainly play in pickup groups. :-/
- Cleric gets all gems - Heh.

I'd like to do this but I'm always worried about getting killed
by wanderers. :-( "Safe" areas are frequently not all that safe,
or else are not close to hunting areas.

I usually keep a good book handy and/or watch anime on my
laptop instead... so med/read, if something pounds on me I hear
it and heads-up to deal with it.

off to see the sights very soon...)
