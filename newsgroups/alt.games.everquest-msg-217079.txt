I was kind of wondering about this myself

We had looted 2 gargoyle granites in one adventure and I had requested to
keep them however looter sold them anyway. I imagine for couple plat to
vendors but items were currently selling for 100-200 plat at bazaar

This is why i wish they had some sort of screen to display all loot to group
at end of adventure then each player could at least see what was looted and
call for anything they wanted before the sell
