    Many items that get farmed are "items of opportunity". If a level 60 is
after, say, a Platinum Dragon Totem in Sol A, they aren't going to kill the
PH then sit on their ass for 20 minutes. They'll consult the map, see if
anything else drops nearby that may have some value so their time in Sol A
isn't a complete waste, and go smack that PH as well. Some items are farmed
as a result of being common drops - I WANT Dusty Bloodstained Gloves, but I
keep getting Savant's Caps. The BIM is an example of a common drop, and the
BIBS is a "nearby spawn" farm.

    For the longest time, a BS Tunic wasn't newbie loot. Even today it can
command 100 or more plat - for someone who can JUST farm the Knight, that's
a fair amount of coin. It also makes it a prime target for people who don't
have the cash to twink an alt out, but who CAN camp the item in question. As
a cleric, my ability to farm is pretty weak - but I was able to get my new
enchanter a Savant's Cap, Dusty Bloodstained Gloves, some Opalline Earrings,
some Bracelets of Woven Grass, a Shimmering Orb, and Gatorscale Sleeves
before she was even rolled up by dropping some "targets of opportunity".
What gets me is in all those cases, the camps in question were open AND
nobody came and asked about them (although I KNOW AC and Scryer in UGuk
aren't often as open as I found them to be).
