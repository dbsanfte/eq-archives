The context is that it *doesn't* matter if its a mechanically superior 
game. EQ2 could be crap or it could be the cat's meow but georg and many 
others don't *want* to change to a different game. They are comfortable 
with EQ1 and they have friends. It isn't a matter of pessimism based on 
what SOE has told us so far...It simply doesn't matter how much better 
any new game is (EQ2 or any other title... and another title will 
eventually eclipse EQ1...)
