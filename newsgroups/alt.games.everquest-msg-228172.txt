Well sorry but having been beaten with just about every melee nerf
stick there was I just dont see any way for it to work. Look at it
this way;

I had a ranger pre-kunark loved it, then one day...

I had a monk pre-pop and was digging the hell out of it then one
day....

I had a warrior pre-ldon liked it a lot then one day...

I started an SK loved it then found myself looking over my shoulder
for a nerf stick ...so I left EQ before they could get him too. Enough
was after all enough.

Granted the war wasnt directly nerfed but was hit by changing game
mechanics and limited versatility. An indirect nerf I guess. Really no
good way to fix it.
