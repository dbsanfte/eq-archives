Depends on the proc.  Some procs (Yak) have unusually high agro.  I would
say, with the exception of an SBD for *utility*, never use a weapon *just*
for its proc.  Buff-procs are another story, however.

Don't worry about Str, it'll come with your armour upgrades.  Keep an eye on
your ATK - it has a much more profound effect on your stabs.  With a Crys
Spear at 44th last night, my ATK was ~915, modal stab 154.  I got a wolf
form (+40 ATK) and my high stab leapt from a previous high of 261 to 281.
My strength was unchanged at around 118.  Str is nice, but the diff it makes
on stabs is minimal.

Last night while hasted, str buffed, with Crys Spear and BR I was parsing
30-39 DPS at 44th, with all skills maxed.  Granted, Orlun is 50th and
probably getting better buffs and weapons.  I know a lot of rogues on the
Safehouse, however, making claims regularly of DPSs in the 50s.  80-120
sounds a bit extreme for 50th without the higher-end disciplines.

Not true.  As a rogue, you are the Agro Manager.  Your job is to stay
*above* the casters and below the tanks.  It's circumstantial, but you don't
"as a rule" evade every single time in an exp group.
