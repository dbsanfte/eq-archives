Most people that play never see level 60 much less 65. The average,
not casual but average, player never gets out of the hell grind of the
fifties (wanna fix the game start there lol) so pop has done nothing
to keep them playing. The content is so vast pre-pop that I dont see
where it was needed to keep us playing. It did line SoEs pockets
nicely though...
Like I said earlier Ive had 3 mains nerfed to hell now, there aint
gonna be a forth.
