Lots of the high end Luclin stuff outclasses pre-luclin, with the
exception of Vulak.

I'm using a luclin 12/16 whip in primary most of the time, keeping
SoD/Jaelen's/Primal in secondary or bagged. Haste available in range or
earring for the first time for most people. There's also a +700 taunt
proc weapon. Seems to be too many mnk/bst or pal/sk weapons in loot
tables though.

Casters have a great time with most 'uber' luclin mobs dropping FT items
up to FT5 and FT6. There's also some very nice chain+ stuff out there. 

Several mobs haven't been killed (Arch Lich, Cursed, Seru) and you can
only imagine what stuff in Vex Thal will be like.

People tend not to 'whoop' too loud about high end stuff these days,
because when they do, complaints from the LoIO 'posse' tend to have a
negative effect on their stats (eg: Mrylo dagger) so people tend to keep
things closer to their chest.
