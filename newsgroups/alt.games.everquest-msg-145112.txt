Back when I was much younger, and thus ignorant enough to think it was
possible to have a "career" as a musician, every wind player I knew
referred to their instrument as an "axe".  I'm pretty sure the term
came from the jazz culture and predated the elecrification of the
guitar by some time.

Besides, Bards can't use two-handers.
