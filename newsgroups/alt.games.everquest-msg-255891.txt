IIRC, KEI and Virtue have a base maximum duration of 150 minutes (cast
by a lvl 65).

Kazad's Mark has a duration of 63 minutes.

BOT9/POT9 have nominal duration of 100 minutes.

FO7 has duration of 80 minutes.

FOS has duration of 100 minutes.

HPS has duration of 72 minutes.

Some buffs (i.e. KEI, Virture) have shorter durations when the caster
can first start casting them.

AAs can extend these durations.
