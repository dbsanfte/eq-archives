Agreed - they probably are off the "new" evil eyes' pets.  There is a 
warrior sword, however.  Looks more like a dagger in hand.  Barely over 2 
on the delay and has a proc of "something spikes".  Can't quite remember.  
Either hand, too, so it goes well with my Wurm until I can afford better.  
Good warrior belt and bracer.  I think 4 items for each class are dropping 
in EK.  I see Shadowknight stuff rotting all the time.

From 150 - 200 people are usually in the zone after the event restarts.  
It's crazy.  So is the loot - way too good for what you kill to get it.

I could make hundreds of plat selling clarities there if that were the kind 
of character I play.  People begging for it like crazy.

The highest mobs are barely red to my 34th chanter, most are blue and 
green.
