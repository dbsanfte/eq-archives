Thanks for al the replys.. actually i was hoping there was a way to
port to other continents and such.  Not concerned about SoL as I don't
have it.   The post below is more along the lines of what I was hoping
to find.  Too bad these are not more dispersed around!

Where do I find this one again?  Not sure where it is exactly
-thanks!
