The issue, as I understand it, is that a beneficial spell cast on a mob 
lasts 5ish minutes, whereas it lasts it's normal duration on a PC.  So, 
on a PC, it will likely last 7 ticks, but on a mob, similar to the bard 
version, it will last 5ish minutes.  Have never tested it to be honest, 
so I don't actually know.
