Bullshit. Allow me to cut and paste my own words rather than allow you the
luxery of putting your preferred script forward as my opinion;

    "If the Mideast was hypothetically-vacated the rest of the world would
already see itself against the wall. Whose next?"

Refuting someone else argument based on your own assumptions rather than
their own words is futile. I still put forward that their would be a
collective global response against anyone who where to annihilate an entire
region.

You are an optimist, I will give you that much. You are still thinking in
terms of a shooting war though, which is not how a sane person would fight a
superpower.

I disagree with the effectiveness of terror as a weapon, especially against
a democratic industrialised country. It's biggest sting is political and
economic.

This sentence hurt my brain. Re-read it and mark yourself on a scale from 0
to 10 on coherant thought when you also consider what your country has gone
through over the last year because of some guys with box cutters.

??? Oh.......

Rastus now realises he has once again found himself trying to reason with a
foaming idiot. What did Mr Clancy tell me? "Never try and teach a pig to
sing. Its a waste of time and all you do is get muddy."
