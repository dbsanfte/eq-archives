> Malaika Tamu Griffin is wanted for the murder of twenty-five-year old

> their first encounter Ms. Loiselle was threatened by Ms. Griffin who
> expressed anti-white animus and stated that she would kill her and kill
> her dogs . Mr. Horsely and Ms. Loiselle are white and Ms. Griffin is
> African-American. Ms. Griffin continued her tirades against her neighbors
> despite the fact that there was no actual provocation.
>
> On the evening of May 18, 1999, Mr. Horsley was assembling carpentry tools
> on a public sidewalk near Ms. Griffin's house. After Ms. Griffin verbally
> castigated Horsely, Ms. Loiselle entered the argument. Both females
> returned to their residences and Jason resumed his work. Shortly
> thereafter and without warning Ms. Griffin returned to the sidewalk armed
> with a laser-sighted 9mm pistol and shot Mr. Horsely in the back at
> point-blank range. Mr. Horsely died minutes later from a fatal heart
> wound.

> While in immediate flight Ms. Griffin encountered an acquaintance who she

> to board a bus to Chicago where she was last seen.
>
> A police search of Griffin's Denver residence uncovered a cache of
> ammunition, diffused hand grenades, a 9mm assault rifle and manuals
> popular with terrorists including The Anarchist's Cookbook and The Poor
> Man's James Bond. Police also found notebooks with Griffin's opinions
> about a coming race war and the necessity of killing white people. None of
> her colleagues or close friends ever heard her express the types of racist
> rhetoric she wrote in her notebooks.
