Lets face it, an idiot is an idiot, it doesn't matter what class they
play.

That being said I have found that a <lot> of the druids and necro's
(at least till the mid to late 20's) have a very limited skill set
when it comes to grouping. I don't thinks its because they are idiots,
I just think that a lot of them are very inflexible to using new
tactics. I play a Necro, one of the few who <almost> never solo's.
Some people are amazed when I heal the tanks, top up the healers mana,
or mez the mobs on a bad pull. I always get comments like "Wow - I
never knew necro's could do that!".

It's not the class, but how its played...
