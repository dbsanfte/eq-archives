Admittedly, I'm only level 18, so I haven't gotten that deluge of
group gate and translocate requests (yet?).  Also, I play on the FV
server, where everyone is anonymous + roleplay, so I may never
experience that unfortunate part of being a wizard.

Can you elaborate on what wizards have going for them?
