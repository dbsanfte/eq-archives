So it seems for every class there's an item for almost every
slot, requiring three or four drop items to complete.  This
is an enourmous number of items, even if some of the items
overlap.

Some of the items seem to be random rare drop off any mob
in certain zones.  This would mean that any hunters there
should be picking up the occaisional drop... almost certainly
useless to them (1/12 its your class, then you have to actually
be interested in the quests as such, which looks like another
1/12 or so)

Other items drop off named rare pops, here at least you
can purposefully seek the mobs out... -if- you happen to
be or are grouped with a tracker.  I'm guessing that of the
times these mobs are killed, 1 in 6 or so its on purpose.

While a good number of these drops are simply discarded
by people who aren't interested in the least, there should
still be quite a supply of items floating around out there on
the wrong classes.

I've never found a single offer to buy any of the items I've
auctioned, or to sell any of the items I might be interested
in.  Am I missing something?

I can only think of three realistic recourses here.  One, a mid
level guild could have a giuld bank full of these items so
you could deposit the "junk to you" ones and withdraw
the "hey I need that" ones.  Two, a channel dedicated to
just this topic, so you aren't spamming or dealing with the
spam from the main auction channel.  Three, a web based
trading site, divided by server, where the various items
could be posted.

Truth is, I'm one of those "who really cares" people, I"ve
not bothered trying much to sell the drops I have, I've
not tried hard to get the drops I "need"... but since my
current character has track and is working some Luclin
zones, I'm starting to accumulate the things almost by
osmosis.

Is there a solution in place for this dilemna?
