If the choice is between druid or shaman you have to make some decisions.
Do you play mostly outside and far less in dungeons, prefer to solo but
grouping is no problem, stay back and dot/nuke something to death  plus do
you want to port all over the world then go for druid.
If you prefer going into dungeons, buff/heal/debuff AND tank a bit and group
mostly go for shaman.

Both classes are welcome in most groups because of their healing and buffing
abilities. Both can do some offensive magic and debuffing, although I think
the Shaman is better at debuffs and the Druid better at offensive, but
that's just my perspective.

This is just my experience with both classes, having never played either
over lvl 3 but I did team with quite a lot of both and asked some questions
about their classes (I prefer to know the abilities of everyone in the
group).
