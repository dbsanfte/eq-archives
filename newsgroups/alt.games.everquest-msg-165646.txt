Nexus, POK, WFP, EFP, wait for boat, OOT.  Get off boat as it nears sister
island

After all, you have a self only invis, the only danger is that it might
drop on you at a bad moment, or that it might drop while you loiter
waiting for the boat to dock.  The former you take care of by watching for
it to blink, and running out of sight to refresh, the latter by picking an
out of sight spot to loiter in till boat arrives.

It IS possible to use underground tunnel in EFP to get to the docks, and
to swim onto the boat.  The trick to doing that is to swim in front of the
boat and let it run you over, stay on the surface while you do this and
you end up inside the moving boat.

There's no reason for a necro to do so, unless you are so low that you
don't have your invis spell yet, in which case sister island seems like a
terrible idea.

If you don't have POP, don't get a port to commons, get one to NRo, its
much closer, and hiring ports is largely a buyers market at this point.
If you do, and for some reason really don't want to use invis, POK to
Freeport puts you inside the tunnels in WFP, you can walk the whole way.
