So here's the deal with Willsapper; its not a great weapon by any means, 
but it isn't terrible either; cuts my DPS in half but paired with a 
shield isn't a big drop in AC/HP from my 1.5, and because of the way 
shield AC counts, is probably actually a better mitigation setup, which 
is good because I'm tanking an unslowed mob.

Once it procs, thats a 3 minute slow, so I can swap in my regular weapon 
and the mob will probably be dead before slow runs out.

The message from the slow landing is the standard yawns one; its small 
and hard to see.  This is a problem, because I really want to swap in a 
real weapon as soon as it lands.

I've tried setting up an additional window and putting all the "mine" 
spells in it, but this window is getting heavy spam; the heal portions 
of my lifetap procs, everyone's DOT damage, and so on.  I need to play 
with this more as I don't really want to switch permanently to the 
Willsapper.

One idea I have is to finally break down and set up an audio trigger, if 
I can find some way to turn off all the other sounds as I generally 
dislike sound on my games, a quiet "Slowed" murmered occaisionally out 
of the speakers might not be intolerable.

The proc rate is not great; I see several TOTC and SOD procs for one 
yawn.  I'm at 24 CE and WA 3 (well, just raised it to 4 and now working 
on 5) so there's some room for improvement, which is vital, the less 
time I spend waiting for slow to land the better.

The slow is also not fantastic, but it is noticable.  Fighting mobs 
where my hp bar slowly drops, when slow lands, my lifetap procs now 
gradually restore me to full hp; on mobs where I used to end a fight at 
50% I'm now ending them at full.  Its not game breaking by any means, 
but it makes things that used to be hard easier, and that was the idea.

What it doesn't do is make things that used to be easy easier; if my 
lifetaps were keeping up with mob DPS already, then swapping in a lesser 
weapon in order to eventually land slow just makes the kill take longer.

And killing multiple easy mobs benefits even less; I have to switch 
between them to slow one after another, all the while with half normal 
DPS, and when I am pulling multiples I'm usually using a DS strategy; 
slowed mobs hurt themselves less on my DS!

I did use it to kill two difficult mobs, slowing both meant my lifetap 
procs were able to keep me alive long enough to kill the first one, then 
I reslowed the second and took him down fairly easily.  The slows matter 
more than Haste for this, because haste doesn't alter my proc rate and 
that's where my healing is coming from.

Aggro is mentioned in the Allakhazam thread on Willsapper.  SK don't 
have to worry much about aggro, if I want it I cast a spell to get it. 
But some testing showed that slow was noticable aggro; I had an SK buddy 
fighting with me at one point, not using extraordinary effort but 
fighting as normal with him as MT, me casting no spells nor taunting, 
one way to tell when slow landed was that the mob would usually turn on 
me.  He could easily get the mob back but it was a certainly a bigger 
hate production than the lifetap augs I normally use.

Oh, and I made a hotkey announcing 35% slow landed, which will amuse me 
for a while, I expect soon enough I'll go back to my normal silence 
about results which don't really concern anyone.
