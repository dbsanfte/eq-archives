With you being the only tank it's your job to pick a critter then beat on it
'til it's dead, 99% of the time NEVER changing targets, even for a moment.

It's the enchanter's job to re-mez all the other critters.

It's everyone else's job but the healer's to assist you.

The only time an enchanter has anything to bitch at the only tank about is
if he is changing targets (note: if there's a caster critter when you're
grouped with an enchanter, it is NOT important to take it down first...DO
NOT change targets if you've already started on some other critter).

But yeah, if an enchanter says something's mezzed, back off and see what
follows you before re-targeting.  It's not that big of a deal but every
little bit helps.
