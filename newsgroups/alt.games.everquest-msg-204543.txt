"Death xp loss" must include lost xp due to getting set up to go again,
including buffing up etc., if you get a rez, then it must include time
spent medding back the zeroed out mana from rez.

"good xp" must be compared to other chanter xp gathering methods to
determine whether its "good" or "crap"

In my experience in ME and in PON, a chanter/cleric pair did a lot more net
exp per hour than the chanter alone, and the same for druid/cleric; I was
able to dramatically lower the death xp loss component by use of stuns,
roots, Cheals on pets, fast heals on the partner... but at the same time,
the druid/cleric pair did a lot more exp per hour net, and the druid needed
the cleric partner a lot less than the chanter/cleric pair did.  This was
before the group exp patch which would add another 20% to the partnerships,
but at the same time before the charm nerf patch which took what, 50% away
from a charm kill?

I'd question, post charm nerf, whether this passes my "good xp" test.  But
its been a long time since I've tried it.

I meant for the chanter, who lacks ensnare at all.  Root the pet, then use
prox aggro to pull to your pet, perhaps a stun on the victim when its in
reach of the pet to let the pet build up some aggro... I'm not sure of the
details really, just thinking root line is something chanters have that
could make the pet less of a problem when it breaks charm.

Another thought I had was to use an AE mez to lock down both pet and victim
on break, then recharm and wait for mezzes to break.  Assuming chanter
charm lasts a lot longer than a nice short duration AE mez...   Hmm, how
about an AE stun instead?

Stop making me talk about this its making me want to set up a chanter twink
to test these theories out!

Must continue to remember that kills per hour isn't the point, if charm
takes half the exp away, then my shaman pet plan is a lot better.
