I'm tired of you complaining about my venting.  Let it go and its just 
another blip.  Respond with your complaints about my complaining, and 
I'll reply.  Because after all, you're wrong.  Not that I'm not also 
wrong, but that doesn't stop the reflex.

If there was so much traffic on this newsgroup that we were in danger of 
exceeding the bandwidth, so people weren't able to get the whole thing 
each day before servers had to delete some backlog (yes, I've been on 
newsgroups like that, back in the day) I could see some validity in your 
complaint.

But as it stands, its just a silly objection.

And while my silly objection is primarily silly not because I'm not 
right, but rather because I'm not complaining in a channel where people 
who might be able to do something about it might see it, Your objection 
is silly because it only causes more of the thing you're trying to stop. 
  I'm unproductive, but you're counterproductive!
