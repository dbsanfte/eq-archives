Hey guys, why am I having so much trouble unlocking my XP. I do
everything in the Tomshardware guide/Video. I test for continuity.
NONE. I change my multiplier. I use a 1500+ so the multiplier by
default is 10. If i change it it still doesnt overclock. I have an
Asus A7V266-E. I made sure the gaps are filled in properly. None of my
bridges are touching each other. Is there anything else I should do to
my Asus Motherboard?
