They should have saved the new engine for EQ 2 instead of slapping it over
the old engine.
Eq is not that graphics intensive to require 512 megs of ram, it is a result
of slapping new code on top of old. They now seem even more afraid of DAOC
by doing the release like this instead of making a whole new EQ.
