Well, I did have a weapon stashed in my bag up til level 58 when I got my
epic, until then, I normally carried a Prophecy Scroll in my main hand.
Even before I got that scroll, I chose weapons based on which one gave me
the best mana pool, not which one was the best weapon.  Despite that, I have
managed to get my offense maxxed, my Piercing skill is still woefully
lacking however.
