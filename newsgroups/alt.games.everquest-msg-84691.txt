*Ears: Opalline Earrings (ac and chr) (off undead barkeep in Unrest)
Neck: Split Paw actually isn't too bad; but you could go with **Silver Sapphire
if you wanted the int and str instead
**Face: Silver Star Ruby Veil (chr and dex)
**Fingers: Electrum Star Ruby (chr and dex)
*Wrist: Polished Bone Bracelets (ac, int, and wis) (off Evil Eyes in the Gorge)
or Golden or Electrum Cat's Eye Bracelets (chr)
*Arm: Hollow Bone Bracers (ac, mana and sv.magic to help you resist aoe mezzing
yourself) (Rathyl's Incarnate in Najena)
Hands: Hmmmm, no good suggestions here - at 30-35ish,  you can get Incandescent
Gloves though (ac, chr and other stuff), or camp Kindle in SolA for Impskin (ac,
int and mana - nice gloves)
Shoulder: Probably could get a Frozen Mantle cheap (ac, mana and sv.cold)
Body: Crystal Covered Shroud is fairly cheap, or you might look into a Blackened
Crystal Shroud (int and chr, very nice for a chanter - could get it yourself at
35 or so)
Back: Kunzar Cloak (ac, int, wis and vs.fire) could be purchased cheaply - in a
few levels you could get a Mystic Cloak (ac and int), if you're willing to do
the camp
Waist: Braided Cinch Cord (ac and int) if you can afford it (about 400pp on
Nameless)
*Legs: Drake Hide Leggings (ac, chr and dex) off the Bartender in SolA
*Feet: Wolf Fur Slippers (ac, agi and mana) off the scryer in perma or Kobold
(ac and mana) off the predator in SolA
Handheld: Go to Oggok and check the merchants - you can usually find Crude
Steins (chr and sta) for about 7pp
Range: Might be able to get a Frosted Gem (ac, int and mana, -5str) - no drop,
Eastern Wastes off snow dervs - you couldn't kill them at that level though, but
someone might let you loot

*Could get these now with a good group I think.
**Player made
