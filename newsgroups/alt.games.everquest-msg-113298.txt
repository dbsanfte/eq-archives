If those other druids have anything like the experiences I have had since
playing a druid then I am not surprised that they were unwilling to give a
SOW in such a busy area. Several times in the past I have been asked to give
an SOW while waiting at the tunnel only for other people to notice and
pester me as well (one cast of SOW isn't much but 5 or 6 is - especially
when not all characters have the meditation skills of a L40 character). I
generally don't mind too much when I am sitting down medding (even if it is
down time between battles) but I have had several people /tell me while
soloing and some have got rather irritated when I haven't responded (yes I
am going to drop everything and focus on composing a reply when in the
middle of a fight!).

I usually don't mind helping out my fellow characters (even for no cost -
although it is nice when they donate), and I am willing to spend some time
in newbie areas giving buffs when I stop off at the towns However I am
annoyed by people who expect to be buffed, aren't willing to come to me to
get a SOW or are rude when the ask. Hell recently I had two characters in
the same zone (NK) and was willing to switch to my druid to bind someone
(normally I wouldn't have bothered as the zone was filled with magic users -
but the guy had been asking for 10-15 minutes)
