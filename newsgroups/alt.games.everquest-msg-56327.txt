What was that utterly stupid comment at the top.. "only warrios get cheal,
paladins and sk's get celest heal"  how about stfu idiot, it's better to say
nothing then to lie because you don't know.

I am a MONK, thats right, not even a "tank", and nor do I have considerably
uber loot.. last night I had 4k hitpoints for the start of the Coldain War
quest, thats right FOUR k, so tell me what the fuck is celestial heal going
to do to that?

Paladins and SK's both have considerably more hitpoints then monks.

There are multiple reasons why warriors are the tanks in uber encounters..
lets start with a few reasons (already stated)
HITPOINTS.  Like for like, they beat all classes
AC.  Like for like, they should beat anybody.
DISCIPLINES.  You know how long that SK is going to last as main tank for
Vindi?  (the main tank goes in before ANYBODY and fights alone until agro is
maintained)
Lets see your getting hit for 800 a pop, so I make that about 6 hits.  What
agro have you built up in that time? Nadda, the first cheal that lands on
you results in a dead cleric, 1 by 1 they all will die.

Now for other reasons

TAUNT.  If you can't keep agro on 1 person you aren't going to succeed, its
that simple.  Warriors get higher taunt skills, warriors get duel wield,
warriors outdamage paladins and SK's (constant fast damage is important to
keep agro).  "Oh oh but paladins and SK's get uber taunt spells"  Yeah thats
right, you stop attacking Vindi and cast a spell, meanwhile you lose agro.
So you now have agro from a resisted snare or whatever, too bad vind wiped
half your fookin raid out already.

If you think im some biased warrior lover your wrong.  IMO they are boring,
I do respect their ability to make things like the statue a possibility
though.  Oh and if you think im anti SK or something.. my alt is a troll SK
