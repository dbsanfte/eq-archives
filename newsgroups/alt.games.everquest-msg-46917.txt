Has anyone else seen this. Zone into Neriak Commons and get near Neriak 
Down Under and crash! It happens about 1 in 5 times after I zone in.

I would blame my configuration but I have two PCs, one is a laptop with 
an ATI Mobility chipset, the other is a desktop with a GeForce 2 MX 32Mb 
and both have the same problem. The only common factor is W2K.

If this common can anyone who suffers the same problem please /bug it? I 
get the strong impression that bugs get ignored unless enough people 
report it.
