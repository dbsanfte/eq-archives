}Done deal. I made a killing tonight selling golden idols of tunare so

}I didn't thinks to ask before I logged, and won't be back in game till
}Thursday, but does any of the Haste line of Enchanter spells like
}Swift Like the Wind or VoG stack stack with the haste on the SCHW or
}FBSS.  I think the bard haste song, don't remember name, does.

Yes, you are allowed one each of:

A. Item haste: FBSS, SCHW, etc.  see 
   http://www.geocities.com/zinphandelchianti/haste.html for more items.

B. Spell haste: Enchanter or shaman, or low-level bard hastes.

C. High-level bard haste

The total of A+B is capped at 100% haste.  C can take you over that cap.
