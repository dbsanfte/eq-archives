Ahh, I figured out what they -really- should do.

Make no drop items tradeable for the first 30 minutes after they're 
looted.

No, never mind, that would give me time port to qeynos and twink my level

Ah!  Tradeable within the subset of the raid or group currently in the 
zone for 30 minutes.  Then you only have to not loot when the designated 
loot winner is sitting at his bind point.  Hmm.
