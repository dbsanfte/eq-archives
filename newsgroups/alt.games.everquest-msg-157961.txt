Not taking you the wrong way. Wasn't too long ago I made my
own way from OT to Oasis by myself with no SoW:
OT->FM->LOIO->FV->Ocean->BB->another Ocean->
EFP->NRo->Oasis. Was *that* ever a trip. (Yes, I know there's
a shorter route, via boat from OT, but no shorter route without
risk of goons. I'm just glad the porters were up.)

This was also with a Cleric.

So I know that legging it is an option, and it's an option I use
reasonably frequently. Especially since due to my timezone
I encounter almost-empty zones disproportionately often.

The "stuck" part had an unstated subtext, "stuck without a port",
not "stuck, can't get anywhere". I'm very miserly (a habit I'll
have to break when peridot consumption becomes an issue) and
would generally rather leg it than pay for a port. But with the
new expansion, this will be less of an issue.

I actually have a stock of SOW potions given to me by my
guildmaster at level 20 (16 levels ago). I've used *three*,
one of which was by accident.

One nice thing about the PoK is that it allows much more freedom
to travel. There's huge numbers of EQ zones where I've
never been; with travelling being easier now, I might be able to
do some sightseeing. Heck, there's two whole continents where
I've never been...
