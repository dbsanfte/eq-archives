Wow, if you have a new guild and have no idea who the members are, you're
probably one of those "winner" guilds who advertise in /ooc, right?

There's no in-game command.  /Who all GUILD will tell you everyone who's
currently online as long as they aren't /anon.

Oddly enough, /who GUILD will list all guild members currently in that zone,
even if they are /anon, unless they've changed it.
