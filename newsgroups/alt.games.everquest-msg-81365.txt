As others have said, the feature has not been implemented yet.

But I doubt if Verant would ever let you accomplish anything this useful
while away from the computer.  I expect that we'll be able to set prices
on items, and others will be able to browse the items one has for sale,
but to actually complete a sale I'll bet you'll have to interact somehow.

I like the idea of a bazaar, with two banks and lots of room to buy and
sell, but I wish they would add better trade skill supply vendors.  Then
it would be a great place to sell jewelry, potions, etc.  And I agree
with the person who noted that the frame rate here seems oddly poor for
such a small zone.
