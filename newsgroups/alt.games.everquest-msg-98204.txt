I shouldn't bring this up, but I will anyway <g>.  With clerics around that
can do 96% rez, doesn't that trivialize death in EQ (for those with high lvl
cleric friends/guildies at least)?

Raids with TPW (total party wipeouts) are very common and accepted now. No
prob...just have a cleric rez everyone...minor exp loss.  Am I the only
person that has noticed this?  This is just an observation...not a call to
nerf so please don't flame <g>.
