A 16 warrior should be able to fight in Paludal in
several spots.   The bandit camps are a bit higher-level
than that, but there's still plenty of good places there
at 16.   If that doesn't work, the caves in Shadeweaver's
Thicket beside the Paludal zone have a couple of camps
that would be really great XP for another level or two.
