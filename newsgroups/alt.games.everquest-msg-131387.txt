The GF4Ti4200 is the better card. You will have to look at review
sites to see how much better in terms of performance.

Today, yes.....

ATI is set to lauch a new round of cards in a couple of weeks. It
"looks" like they will have their next generation card out before
Nvidia. Prices/performance have not been announced yet. NVidia should
have thier new card out by the fall.

I have a GF4Ti4200 and I love it. Works great in all games.
