Fun, aren't they? I've gotten one myself on another newsgroup. He was
originally following someone else around, I expressed my opinion of
his very stupid and uncreative posts (after all, most of them were in
a 'group story' we're writing) and he decided to go after me instead.
Now, his sig says I'm a figment of the newsgroup's collective
imagination, and his latest post to the 'group story' has him dreaming
of squashing my head with his bare hands. He's so lame it's almost
funny, and his original target is complaining that he should leave me
alone and go back to stalking her.
