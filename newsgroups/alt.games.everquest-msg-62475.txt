My Radeon VE has the cahrs made up of diff textured and colored triangles that
are constantly moving.  I got the new dx8 dll from the test server that they
put out today to replace the one rom yesterday.  Certain Radeon work but some
don't.  I have spoken to tech support.  The VE does not have hardware T&L so
that might be a prob.  The other radeons do.

My friend has a radeon 64 mb and his dx8 works fine.
