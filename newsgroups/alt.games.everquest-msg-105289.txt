Hi SR - I use a rule of thumb in this group that works well for me.
Ok, I actually use it some other groups that we have or have had in
common as well.  :-)

When someone jumps all over your shit - which is inevitable no matter
how/what you post - dump 'em in the KF for 2 weeks.  I love that
setting in Agent.  Keeps the thread sizes smaller and the blood
pressure down.  After 2 weeks they pop out of the KF and it is a clean
slate (to me) until the next time.  

With some of the 'characters' in AGE, you just won't ever 'win' a
debate or settle a discussion amicably.

The irony is, most likely, this post is gonna get *me* jumped on too.
Oh well.
