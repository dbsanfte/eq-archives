Eh, screw the EULA.  The only people flamed are those who bitch that they
were CAUGHT disregarding it...not taking responsibility enough to say "damn,
I was caught.  Oh well...that sucks, but I'll get over it without blaming
others."

I "legally" own 2 accounts (52 dru/54 enc) and I'm paying for my brother's 2
accounts (one of which I bought him).  He has a 57 cle on one and a 49 ogr
war on the other.

I have 3 computers.  All I need is one more and I can potentially go
ANYWHERE alone. <g>

But seriously, death doesn't worry me anymore, and I never have to worry
about ports or getting Clarity 2.  It's a nice feeling but hasn't helped me
not to be a bit burned out anyway.  I mean, I've been playing almost every
day for 2.5 years now...how much more CAN I take?
