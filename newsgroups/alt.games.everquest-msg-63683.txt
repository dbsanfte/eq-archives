	Both, and a bunch more problems, the specifics of which were particular to
UO but the generalities would most likely apply to any game.

	In PvP, PKs could gate into an area, sweep it, and gate or Recall out
before anyone could even TRY to organize a retaliatory strike.

	In PvE, all areas with decent resources were marked and hit like
clockwork.  You know how Wizards and Druids will bind next to Hadden and gate
over when he's due to see if he's up?  Now multiply by every decent spawn
point in the game, and imagine that everyone in the game can do it.

	This applied to trade skills, too.  All vendors with needed resources were
marked.  Tailors, for instance, would carry bags of runes for every tailor
shop in the world, and when thread was due to spawn on the vendors, they'd
Recall around the world and buy it all.  Worse: people would hit every spell
reagent vendor in the world, buy up all the reagents...and put them on their
OWN vendors at two or three times the price.  (*Every spell* in UO requires
reagents, btw.)

	There were other minor annoyances, but they escape me now.

	Within limits.

	More than ease of travel, the game needs more bind points.  Stonebrunt in
particular is absolutely murdered by its bind situation.

	I don't believe the average Druid or Wizard would consider NPC teleporters
to be a threat to their usefullness -- more like the allievation of a burden.

	To answer your other post, if you were to offer teleports for 50 pp on
E'ci, you'd be laughed out of the zone.  25 pp is plenty.  The specific price
point for such a hypothetical service as NPC teleports is not really the issue
anyway.  The fact that two classes might lose some of their ability to raise
cash is not nearly injurious enough to serve as a counter-argument given the
benefits of such a service.
