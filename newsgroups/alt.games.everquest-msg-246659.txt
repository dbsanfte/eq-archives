I was sigining up for beta the other day and when i got to a certain
point it said something like "if you would like sony to purge it's
memory of old dxdiag files you must start over and so.. and so.." but
i didnt know if it meant like if you screwed up or did they keep your
dxdiag files from like when you tryed out for lords of everquest beta.
When i tryed out for lords of everquest i had a dial up connection so
does this mean they kept my dxdiag file from then?
