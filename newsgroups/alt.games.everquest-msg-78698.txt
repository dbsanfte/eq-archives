Not entirely true.  You need to be at the top of the hate list, and a
certain percentage of damage has to have been done to the mob would be my
guess.  I have been summoned a number of times now without having done a
single point of damage.  Just slow mob and heal tanks was enough.  This has
happened to me on 3 separate occasions.  Once during a ring war in GD, I was
healing melee folk, never cast any spells on the giant in question, yet I
was repeatedly summoned to him.  Tanks killed him just in time to keep me
from dying.  Twice in the hole, I was repeatedly summoned in the pit, only
offensive spell I had cast on him was enstill, in an attempt to root park
him, after we had lost our enchanter.

I am fairly new to fighting mobs that summon, so I certainly won't claim to
have a good feel yet for when they will summon.
