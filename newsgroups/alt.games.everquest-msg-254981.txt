Aye, some buffs it makes sense to start on whoever is available... 
although to be honest, I'd Virtue the main tank and BOA the rest of the 
group in most cases... assuming they don't want Kazad to go with their 
POT9 instead that is. Since Kazad duration is much shorter, now you're 
back to casting it just before going in.

Nice thing about my mage was that this wasn't true at all, I could start 
"buffing" the group by handing out jewelry bags, heaps of arrows, pet 
toys, mod rods... heck in many cases I could not only "buff" people when 
they showed up, I could do so -before- they showed up.

Nice thing about my berserker is there isn't a damn thing he can do for 
anyone before going in.  And imagine the fun when I die... I run in to 
zone, loot body, turn and throw an axe at something and hit the 
"incoming" button.  Buff me during the fight I say, lol!

My cleric would probably have to kill me, lucky he's on the same account 
so he never has to deal with the insanity.
