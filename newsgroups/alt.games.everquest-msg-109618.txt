Yep, it would have to be a fully new EQ with no old characters since
the character development is fully different. I don't know, if things
are "mundane" then breaking and decaying is fine. 

I always thought that items should be disposeable in an mmorpg and
that skills/stats should be a characters TOTAL power with armor and
items just being icing on the cake. A character might get higher AC
armor in their travels from creatures or what not, but it would always
be replaced or upgraded before it really decayed much. UO was a lot
like that, people could fix your armor or what not but you really
never bothered since you just got more later. This makes for a better
economy while making it so you can just adventure and have fun rather
than camp an uber beast for X super duper item that your class NEEDS
(like a haste belt and high speed good ratio weapons for a warrior in
EQ)

SO I think item decay is fine if its like that. Item decay would mean
that it won't be like EQ now is at all, where you get an epic or go on
a guild raid for 6 hours for 4 drops. No one would do that if the
things decayed. I'm thinking "guild raids" will be a thing of the past
in new mmorpgs, they basically just totally suck ass. I've been on
some lately in EQ where after I was done I just thought "What the hell
is the point anymore in spending 6 hours for 4 or 5 drops which are
barely incremental upgrades for people?"
