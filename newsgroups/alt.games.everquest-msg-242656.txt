Umm, so you're saying the few points you made were invalid, but my
points are garbage and I'm a dumbass anyway.

See, the difference between you and me is, that when I call someone
names like I did in the post, I take the time to explain why, and back
it up.

You also completely missed the fact that I pointed out that I agree
with much of the things he brings up about what it means to be a good
group player, it was a matter of attitude about the game with a good
dose of cocky-ness that set me off.

In other words "You've lost any debate in this instance before it's
even begun." because you didn't even take the time to make an argument
or debate.

If you can prove me wrong based on what I said, go ahead, I don't mind
being corrected if I'm wrong. I mind being called names without so
much as a rational explanation.
