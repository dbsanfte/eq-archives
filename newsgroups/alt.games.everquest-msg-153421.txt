Does anyone know of an item that a shaman can use with a  snarelike effecti
can use on  critters with a right clickable effect?  i want to solo some
seafuries but i seem to keep ending up too close to them and want to slow
them down so i can cast on them?? anything along the lines of snare or
engulfing darkness will do as long as it's right clickable and manaless.
TIA.
