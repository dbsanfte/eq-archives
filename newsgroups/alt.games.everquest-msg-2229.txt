And I think here is Freeman's biggest problem (and a lot of others'):
He cannot seem to grasp the difference between being "criticized" or
"chided" and being "flamed". He starts into playing his "not
namecalling, calm looking insults", and tries to tell us we're the bad
guys when we start flaming him and he's so innocent because he's not
doing any name-calling.
