Save threads up till you start looting pelts.  Get a skinning knife.
use the knife to turn MQ into LQ, and HQ into MQ into LQ.
Combine any LQ pelt with a thread to yield a backing.  Those
will reliably sell for 5pp each, so you just turned 2 spiderling
threads (approx value 5sp) and a pelt (best case scenario
HQ pelt worth 2pp) into5pp on the hoof... instead of just
the thread, where you are merely turning the silks into a 1pp item.

Don't chop up HQ Bear pelts, those still retail for 20pp or so each.
