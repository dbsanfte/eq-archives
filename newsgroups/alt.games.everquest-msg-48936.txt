That sucks, for a little bit of xp.
I admit, I did it once... tho in this case the mob was quillmane in SK.
Actually it was rather courteous of me letting him have his chance and not
just blowing away Q myself.
Fortunately for me he wasnt up to it. Somehow on that occasion I didnt feel
obliged to help him out.
