    Normally, that's exactly what you'd say to people who complain about
trains. But read his rant more carefully. He's angry that when he zones into
KC on the side where trains are (by popular convention) not supposed to go,
he gets hit by a train ASAP. At least that's how I read it.

    I've had the exact same problem - zoned in on the "safe side" just to
see what the zone population was like these days, and the first thing I saw
was some troll chugging right for me with four things behind him and two or
three other mobs eating alive the people who were medding on that side. When
I went in after I figured things would be calmer, again, same troll, only
this time people were shouting pithy comments like "Your OTHER right,
jackass!" I assume he'd been told which way to train and wasn't doing it.
