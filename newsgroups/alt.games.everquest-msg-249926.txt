Does that include multiboxers as 'groups'?

I'd give EQ a 6.5 myself if you don't count 2boxers.
Sure you need to group to do anything really interesting, but theres an 
awful lot of people solo farming, cash, quest items, aa, or pling alts...

Heh... my experience with AC was 3.0 but that was on darktide... things 
were different on DT. It was probably closer to 3.0 in EQ (rallos zek) 
too, but that was pre-Kunark. I haven't played RZ for a long time 
because PvP in EQ sucked so badly :)
