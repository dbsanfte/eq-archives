Why bitch only about the Cleric armor?  The only piece of the
Paladin armor that is worth even as much as the two bars of
enchanted platinum required is the greaves, and that's not
because they're all that good, but rather because decent plate
legs are incredibly expensive.  The BP of Ro gives a couple
more STR than the Netherbian Chitin, weighs a little less,
and is a light source, but it's Paladin only, so it's worth
about the same (i.e. 25pp) yet it's expensive and difficult
to get, if you're masochistic enough to do the quest.

Sol Ro quest armor is as obsolete as rusty weapons and patchwork.

Kaev <-- who finally upgraded his Ro Greaves at L53
