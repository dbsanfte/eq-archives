This commercial looks strikingly similar to a commercial I saw way back that
was for Final Fantasy 11(!?).
Where there also where some young people getting in touch with each other
over phones and beepers calling in the crew for some hunt. They even had one
of the players get into the game on an arcade machine that was running FF
(Are there even those? And connected to the internet too).

So yes, I think the target audiance for EQOA is the low to mid teens
demographic, just as most console games are.
