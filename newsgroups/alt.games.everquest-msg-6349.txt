I think the point is, had this warrior played the game for any reasonable
period of time - especially in a group - he would have known this already.
At level 15, all twinked out, there are but two possibilities:

1) He has a higher level character and twinked himself out. If so, he should
have known something as basic as the "flaw" in taunt, among other skills.

2) Somebody else's higher level character twinked him out before he
sufficiently learned much of the game's most basic mechanics. That is bad
for everybody involved.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not an anti-twinker. When I want to try a new class,
you bet I do some minor twinking (usually little more than raw-hide armor, a
handful of plat and a fine steal weapon) ... but guildmates who load up a
new player with great gear are doing them an injustice.
