Funny, my brother-in-law bought it from Walmart Monday and I bought it
on Tuesday. Gotta love the pre-order scams.

It does... it's just a little bit further down the hall from the
Velious/Odus port. It's a book on a pedestal. Click on it and it works
just like a zone or port. The thing you are really going to love is
that once in POK you can port to and from most major cities.

The interesting part is that I think there will still be people
looking to port to certain areas. Lavastorm and Iceclad come to mind.
If you are KOS in Neriak, you have to port to Freeport and hoof it
from there. If you want to go to Iceclad, take the GD port and walk
through it and the EW. Usually people have more plat than patience and
just want to pay to go directly there.
