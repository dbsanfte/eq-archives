You might want to check out this site. It shows you exactly how much XP is
needed per level and how many mobs you will need to slay to obtain a level -
even shows you according to the difference in levels between you and the
mob.

I am certain that post hell levels are not mini levels. Whoever told you
that was pulling your leg.

51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 too. 59 is the worst of all. 51 is about
1.5x as bad as 45 (which is pretty bad, takes 2-3 hardcore sessions to get
through).

You
lose the normal amount of experience in them, it just LOOKS big.
