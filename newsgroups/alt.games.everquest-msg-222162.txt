The problem arises when the frameworks, personally thought out as they are,
come in conflict.  My framework, personal, well thought out (at least I
think so) and defensible, is not similar to yours.  So in our interpersonal
relationships, which moral framework takes precedence?

For example, you stated above that "... most moral of all would be to refuse
to kill because it is simply wrong to do so, coming to that conclusion by
philosophical thought...".  In my moral system this statement is wrong.  I
consider killing to be perfectly alright (and even necessary) under certain
circumstances.  The only thing preventing me from following my own moral
rules is the certainty that my moral rules are in conflict with current
societal laws; I'd be punished.

Another example:

Under my own moral beliefs, I see no effective difference between a cat and
a baby.  Both are people (they have personalities), both are capable of
independently reasoned action, and both are incapable of seeing beyond
certain types of consequences.  The fact that the baby has greater potential
in the long run has no bearing on "now".  Both need to be restrained from
taking actions that they each individually feel are perfectly reasonable,
but from my PoV are not.

Similarly, with a rottweiler or a teenager threatening an elderly person.
Both are viscious, dangerous, and unlikely to respond to calm, soothing
words.  I see little wrong with killing either one.  As a matter of fact,
killing the teenager will convey a message to other teenagers; killing the
rottweiler will not, unfortunately, convey a similar message to other
rottweilers.  Thus, killing the teenager actually is more generally
effective than killing the dog.
