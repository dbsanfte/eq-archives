Ok, I'm level 52 and never been on a raid, never seen these two dragons.
Spriritually land locked, as William Styron might say. In fact, I'm sure the
neighbors are starting to talk. I need to do something about this. As I
understand things, I can't be higher than level 52 or I'll be unable to
participate, so one of the reasons I've parked at this level, accumulating
AA points (ouch!) is to preserve my option to do just that. When my friends
at 47 catch up with me, all of us would like to experience this rite of
passage.

What I've culled from bits and pieces of conversations is that there are
ongoing pickup raids for these two that we can easily join. I've also heard
that the dragons don't just come around every day waiting for people to kill
them, they are on something like a week-long spawn timer and they are taken
out pretty quickly once they do pop.

So, what's the story. Is this how it works? Is there indeed a consistent
spawn timer on these guys? Is there a common procedure used across servers
to organize these raids or is pretty adhoc? Is there anything else I should
know or that you would suggest that would help me realize this objective?

Or should I just say screw it, hit the AA off and get back to leveling? ;-)
Opinions sought.
