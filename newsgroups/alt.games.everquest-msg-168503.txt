Why should there be a poll?

It doesn't have to be approved. Anyone can post a
FAQ. 

Even you.

Why are you reading the FAQ anyway?

Surely there is nothing you don't know?

Why not?

This is an unmoderated newsgroup, and no FAQ can
be official.

If you have an objection to something in the
current FAQ, then voice it. I am sure the poster
of the FAQ will give it the consideration due.

You are probably correct, but doesn't that line
come from ISP's guidelines on posting to
newsgroups?

And, there are things that just about everyone
agrees ARE off-limits.

These would include;
Advertising sales on playerauctions
Being specific about hacks and cheats
Make money fast schemes
etc..
