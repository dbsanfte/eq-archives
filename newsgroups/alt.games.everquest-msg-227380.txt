Me? I'd deguild. And wait until it sorts itself out one way or the other.

The last thing I'd want to be is somebody elses manipulated sheep. If 
your guild did revolt then well ... I wouldn't want to be a part of it.

And if it didn't they should have no trouble respecting your decision, 
... you can always rejoin once you are satisfied that nothing untoward 
was perpetrated by your leaders.
