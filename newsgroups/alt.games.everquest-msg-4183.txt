OK this is my problem. Last night I came upon the ruins with all the
skeletons still spawned and not killed and I praised my good luck.  I killed
them all off and anytime any one asked me if i was camping her.  All of a
sudden I see a shout Pyjin(spelling?)  is dead.  I shouted back 'where was
she' and she was over by the zone to WK... I had been sitting at the ruins
for nearly an hour and she never came by.  The guys said sorry he didn't
know she was camped. And that he had gotten the GBS.  I then turn around to
find a lvl 60 necro behind me who said he had been there the whole time
killing skeletons, and I replied how could you when i got here they were all
spawned and no one was here.  I was then fed up for the night and decided to
go.  Let the lvl 60 have over kill and make him happy.
