...or just fill in the centralised petition form on the EQ website. For
a time-imperative (ie: it's not in relation to a realtime ingame
problem) problem, now that GMs are centralised rather than server
specific, you'll probably have better results from that avenue. More
than anything, they don't vanish after 3 hours, or rely on someone else
passing your info on to a GM. It's a direct, non-disappearing, line.
