You seem to be pulling that one out quite a bit. Something in your past 
bothering you maybe? I've read it and it's STILL not the same thing. You 
seem to assume that something done in the privacy of someone's own home 
is the same thing as getting caught in a car out in public a la' Hugh 
Grant.

Hmm maybe the fact that SOMEONE didn't get away with it. Spiteful? Maybe 
or maybe not. Lokari didn't specify and no one bothered to ask.

And some people have the honor to know the difference between following 
and not following rules. Do I speed? Yes I do. And if I'm caught I don't 
whine about it.. I PAY THE TICKET BECAUSE I BROKE A RULE. I don't care 
if "everyone does it." To me that's just BS. 

Personally, I wouldn't have petitioned said idiot. I don't really want 
to waste the time on that sort of thing. But I do respect others' rights 
to do exactly that. And that's what it boils down to. Respect. Did 
he/she respect others when coming up with that name?
