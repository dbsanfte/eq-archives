Bizbee:  Have you ever stopped to think about how often you put people down?
You are constantly calling everyone names and basically telling them that
their opinion is wrong and yours is right.  There's no need for that, noone
has  done that to you, they have just stated their opinions without name
calling.  Please, this is just a newsgroup to ask/answer questions and
debate our opinions, not a sling em and fling em group.  Thank you.
