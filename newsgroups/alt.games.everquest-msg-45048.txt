Okay, but if it was because I was a rogue, wouldn't they have said something
to the effect of "Filthy Rogues..." That's what I have experienced in the
past. For instance some merchants wont sell to Rogues and they say "I don't
speak to rogues, much less sell to them." and when I go to the Rogue guild
in Qeynos they say "Halflings like you don't belong here, be gone." or
somesuch. So based on this, they guards saying "Filthy Halflings..." tells
me it's more a racial thing than a class faction. Right?

And you're right, I didn't pay attention to what they though of me when I
conned. This is the 1st experience I've had with this sort of treatment.
