    A lot of that stuff is stuff I've never even heard of before. Has he
been rot hounding? ;-)

    Or at least level him up enough for CotH and Mod Rod II. ;-)

    If you'll accept my advice, I'll be happy to give it.

    Assuming you're levelling him on standard melee-type mobs where resists
aren't an issue, you've got the right items in hand already.

    You summon a bracer for the same effect.

    Don't know about "best", but the good old Platinum Tiara from Lower Guk
is better than what you have (35 HPs 50 MANA). Dirt cheap, and that area of
Guk would still be blue to your mage (indeed, it stays blue for a fair
while).

    Summoned earring, saves mana on every DD cast. Can't imagine you having
something else.

    There's a random rare drop necklace off the robes in Maiden's Eye,
Shaded Medallion. Let me just go... TO ALLAKHAZAM'S! Ah, here we go - and
there's two that drop randomly there:

Medallion of Life: Wt 0.10. +10 AC, +5 Str, +5 vsMg, +5 vsFire, +5 vsCold,
+5 vsPos, +5 vsDis, +50 Mana, LORE MAGIC NODROP Classes: Bl N E Mg Wz Sm D
C.
Shrouded Medallion: Wt 1.00. +12 AC, +5 Str, +15 vsMg, +5 vsFire, +5 vsCold,
+25 Mana, LORE NODROP   All Classes. All Races.

    Both of those are pretty good - Shrouded is a bit more spare on MANA,
but random rare drops are random! You could also go with the old standby
velium black sapphire necklace (65 HP/MANA), or the Stone Bead Choker I
picked up for my ENC for 300 pp yesterday (5 INT/CHA, 25 HP/MANA, drops off
a named stone guy in The Grey).

    Ring is a crappy slot. Lots of mediocre junk, then a big step up to the
good stuff. Shadel Bandit is one of the few "intermediate" rings out there.
Maybe look at a Diamond Wedding Band?

> Cloak.. not sure.. heiro I guess if i see 1 for under 10k, but failing
that,
> what should I look for?

    Your cloak is OK. Shissar Scale is mildly better, and you may get one if
you level up in The Grey. Hiero is very close to endgame stats - if you got
your mage one it's safe to say you'd never replace it unless you changed
mains.

> Belt.. hmm? nfc what to go for.

    Fetid Flesh, the one off the Dregs in FG, is the usual INT-caster belt
these days. If you have a spare Crystaline Spider Fur Belt from your days in
Tents, that works better than the Cinch Cord too.

> Range item.. hmm shrug

    Yours is OK. If you want a bit more mana, buy a Frozen Orb.

    People still want the Ring of Winter and the Cloak? Those would be nice
items for the mage.

    Three slots you didn't mention: legs, feet, face. Legs, go and get cheap
Grey Flesh Trousers and swap in the old pants when you want to re-buff. I
again got mine yesterday for 300 pp - AC 7 HP/MANA 35 CR 10. For feet, go
get a pair of Coldain Skin Boots. Finally, face - Enshrouded Veil all the
way. It has Summoning Efficiency III, and that's huge for you. And the stats
aren't bad, either.
