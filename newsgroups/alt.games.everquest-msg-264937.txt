About halfway thru my "no phone line" time last year, I got a connection 
working thru my Verizon phone.  I couldn't get EQ working... but it 
wasn't till I got back to a real phone line and -still- couldn't log on 
to EQ that I found out it was a setting in OE that was causing the 
problem.  I suspect I could have used the verizon connection to play EQ 
after all.

Sadly, I've now moved to Cingular, and I'm not at all sure the same is 
true of this connection; had to move to it because of my wife's business 
and some messed up problems with credit card acceptance, which 
definately trumps my ability to play EQ.  On the surface, it appears 
that it will cost me $75 a month for an unlimited connection, and that 
seems a bit steep (on top of MMOG monthly fee) to play games.

But this was about the RV, not the connection; again, I can use a cell 
phone without an RV just as easily as I could use satelite without an RV.

Plus I was just teasing Annie, which is a fine hobby I could reccomend 
to anyone.
