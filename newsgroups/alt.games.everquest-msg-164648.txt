My 1/2 Elf Druid dinged 40 recently, and since Bazaar opened, I finally have
a decent kit of armor and accessories appropriate to my level.

My question is are there any "musts have" no-drop items that I don't know
about, and of course, where do I get them?

I have my Testament of Vaneer. What else should I be looking for?
