Yes, there's definitely pallys, chanters, mage, necro...  I -think- I've 
seen clerics.  I think I've been backstabbed by frogs before...

Ooo, I wonder what the pet will be? :)

}Although - the notion of a froglok bard REALLY appeals to me :)

Why are there so many
Songs about Frogloks
And froaking the oooother side?

Frogloks are wizards,
and cast some illusions,
But frogloks have nothing to hide.

Some kill froggys just for their phat lewt
I know they're wrong, wait and see...

Someday we'll find it, the Froglok connection,
The pharmers, the Froakers, and me!
