In effect, perhaps, but nothing about that means that they must
inherit *all* traits of one or both classes. It's a new class, plain
and simple. There's no reason it has to fall into any neatly packaged
categories.

No, obtuse is spending so much time whining about not being able to
use one single in-game item.

Get over it, already.


>Something *was* changed; that is not even possible to dispute.

Easily disputed. Prior to SoL a beast master could not wear the fungi
tunic. Following SoL a beast master can not wear the fungi tunic.

Net zero.

Ah, you've got a statement as to what Verant's intent was then? I'd
love to see a link.

Nerf or not, it's the way it is until and unless it changes. Again,
get over it.
