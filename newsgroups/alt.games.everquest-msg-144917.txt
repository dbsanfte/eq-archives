As far as I know you can't filter stuff OUT, only "all but this"
out.

Bazaar search will only return a limited number of items, so having
stuff pop up that you don't want is more than a nuisance, it can
actually prevent you seeing items fitting your search criteria due
to them being over the list size.

Yes, he can search for spells... but what if he was looking
deliberately for focus items... all those copies of Improved
Invisibility to Undead are of no interest but prior to this addition,
it wasn't possible to filter them out.

Since adding in things like exclusions and minimum or maximum
or so forth would mean additional programming, I don't expect
these any time soon.  As a substitute, more, smaller categories
like "focus effect" would be an improvement over the "mass grab
bag" we currently have.

Good news
