That does not mean that the responsiveness would be in the form of
making plans to include an HIV+ character.  It does not even
explicitely say that they would consider such plans as part of a
responce.  You are assuming both.  While not unreasonable assumptions,
you seem unable to distinguish between facts and assumptions.  No
matter what you may feel it reasonable to *read into* these
statements, you are not helping your credibility by claiming your
interpretations are fact.

> Releases on the topic??

They are responding to media questions, which should be obvious to
even you.  I have no plans to expand my company to the US, nor I have
ever discussed it, but if newspapers kept calling me about it I would
likely issue a statement about it.  (No doubt you would then point at
me and say, "So you ARE discussing it!")

You remind me of my grandmother.  She once heard a talk show audience
member suggest that, at some point, Canada could start charging for
watching broadcast TV.  She spent the next few years warning people
that they would soon need a license to watch broadcast TV.
