They don't even compare.  The toughest exp/named in Veksar hit for
around half their POP counterparts, have fewer HP, don't gate (a bad
gate and a harmony/pacify class who isn't quick with the harmos can
wipe the first floor of BoT), and lower or no nukes/procs.  The
weakest mobs will hit for over 500 (quading as well) and proc some
mean shit on you.

No one said /disc defense is for raids only.  That's like saying a
Ranger's Weaponshield or Trueshot are only for raids.  However the
only noteable time the Warrior class holds a clear advantage is when
fighting mobs well above your level or mobs that are serious
undercons.
