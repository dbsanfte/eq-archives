From the description below it sounds like you were in the Takish dungeon
with the circular stairs at the end (or the common place for rescue
victims or bosses). If he was in your level range he wouldn't have SoS
and Tak is crawling with casters, many who may have see invis up. Traps
are a bit of a pain in LDoN as well, as you can use sense trap, not spot
something, walk 5 feet and trigger a trap. The recycle time on sense
traps is way to long to reliably find traps while scouting, it would
take forever. With my rogue I wasn't comfortable scouting ahead in LDoN
until I'd got SoS and escape.
