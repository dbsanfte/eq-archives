Not really. You'll find that pretty much every shaman specialized in
alteration.

In the 30s, a shaman won't get all that much benefit from cann1 unless
he has a fungi or ikky BP. Slow doesn't become all that useful until
39th lvl when you get the first 50% slow, so I do think that in the
30s a cleric tends to be a better healer. 

At the high end, don't underestimate slow. Marginally useful with one
mob in camp (I'll try to slow once and if resisted switch to DPS) but
slow is still invaluable for handling big pulls in LDoN. Offtanking,
a 75% slowed mob still makes a world of difference. 

... and don't forget Tigir's! It hasn't gotten much use over the last
two years but it's definitely moved back to the front of my spellbook
with LDoN. AoE slow is very, very useful there.
