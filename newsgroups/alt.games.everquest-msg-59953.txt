Your serial numbers are forever useless since they are now firmly
ingrained as having been used on your account, for all time. Your
account NEVER goes away. In 2 years from now if EQ is still around you
can use your same login and password, pay the subscription fee and
pick up on your chars right where you left off. This is just good
business for verant, they KNOW that most players will eventually
return.

So what you can give your friend if you cancel is your login and
password. He can then play your velious enabled account. In order to
make his account velious enabled (if he has an account) he'd still
have to buy velious.

The verant store currently has Mini box velious and kunark, they are
$14.99 each so its a good time to buy velious.
