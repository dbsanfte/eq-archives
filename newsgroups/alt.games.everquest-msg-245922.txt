...or enchanter/ranger.  Having a 14 minute snare available makes
charming stuff trivial.  If you want the most experience possible
between two people, there is no better combination

This really isn't bad.  You get pretty good mitigation and good DPS,
plus pulling, buffing, etc.  What you should consider is how much
effort you want to put in to your dual boxing, IMO.  Using a melee and
Shaman is relatively "easy" compared to other combos.  Druid/Necro,
Druid/Enchanter, Mage/Ranger, whatever the combo, using two classes
that do non-melee DPS will likely be more complicated.  Someone
mentioned agro kiting.  This may be pretty tough to do for one person,
since you need to do so much with both characters.  With one character
as melee, you will probably limit the kind of DPS you could do
otherwise, but then charming stuff, fear kiting, aggro kiting, etc
takes a lot more effort.

Enchanter/Druid or Ranger is what I would do.  You will drop mobs
faster than with any other combination and while it is a bit more
complicated than Monk/Shaman, its a lot less complicated than aggro
kiting or fear kiting (as with Necro/Rog).  You really just need the
snarer to snare you a pet and pull to the Chanter.  Turn to the
Chanter screen and tash, mez, charm.  Petguard and get away.  Turn
back to snarer screen and pull a mob with snare to the charmed pet. 
Turn back to the Enchanter's screen again and send the pet.  Slow the
pulled mob.  Mob dies in about 3.4 seconds.  Repeat until pet is near
death.  Either finish with Druid/Ranger or invis, mez, and pull a new
pet.
