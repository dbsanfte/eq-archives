Did I say anything about feeding itself? No I said sit on a bed for a
half hour. All higher animals teach and nurture their young to some
degree until their young can take care of themselves on their own.
Nurturing and taking care of however does not include respiration or
circulatory systems. If a being can't breath or pump blood on it's own
it's not autonomous and if its not autonomous it's a parasite or a
symbiont or a fetus, none of which have the same rights as an
independently survivable human.
