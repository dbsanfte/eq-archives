You know that is seriously deceptive, since you are also the
registered owner of the domain name.

Here's what I would suggest, tell us all that you have found uber
xploit number xxxx and that you have posted it to your site.  Be
honest and truthful about it.

Also don't charge for the information, or for access to your site,
make your money from selling complete compendiums in say a PDF format,
that can only be unlocked with a password, otherwise you are actually
violating TOS with PayPal and they will shut you down for it.

Otherwise keep the individual exploits in the open where anyone can
see them, yes verant will see it and yes they will bitch whine moan
and eventually close the exploits one by one, but if you are good
enough to find these, then you will hopefully be good enough to find
others as they can and do pop-up.  For example.
