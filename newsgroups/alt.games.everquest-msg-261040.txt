This morning and early afternoon, some bards were just finding out
they have been nerfed big time.  Several were quite upset and
threatened to quit EQ for good. 

One of them even went to PoK and started sprouting illegal 3 and 4
lettered words.

I sympathesize with them but we can't do anything about that as Sony
owns EQ and they can mess things around.  So far I have not been
inconvenced by the recent change although I had to turn off more
graphical eye candies.
