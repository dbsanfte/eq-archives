I'm on NTL broadband... same stuff, diff company

Okie... techie bit coming up... anyone who actually does this kind of thing
for a living, feel free to flame my methods and general ignorance ;o)

The IP address of Ant Bayle is (according to UO Trace) 195.33.108.10

Looking that IP up on...

http://visualroute.visualware.co.uk/

shows that IP address is in Holland... which we know is wrong... it's
physically inside the London Internet Exchange (LInX) :o)

That's because the IP address block 195.33.xx.xx is run by AT&T Europe(NL)
