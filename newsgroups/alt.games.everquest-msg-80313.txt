Well, I have to admit to skipping over much of The Fellowship (my only
excuse being well, I saw the movie and read the book 30 years ago!)... but
I -have- been reading The Twin Towers (Two Towers?) (I'm hell on names)...
so I don't recall Tom Bombadil. (I promise, I'll go back and read it!)
I -was- wondering about the elfblades (memory isn't what it used to be!),
and I was wondering about those elf cloaks and cloak pins (and oh gosh
wouldn't I love to have one of those!) No one explained it at all, but I
suppose they thought that most people either wouldn't see it or would
remember it from the book... which I did, eventually. Ok, I don't remember
the part about Frodo asking Tom why he couldn't carry The One Ring... (will
go back and reread, I promise)... as to the Ents, I thought the same thing
myself... how will they explain that? The Riders of Rohan, I think they
would have little trouble with, but the Ents?? I hope Peter Jackson has
something up his sleeve besides his elbow!

I like the addition of Arwen as a mostly major character (ok, simply because
she's gorgeous and it gives Aragorn more "life" or something, as he wears
her medallion) (and I know they marry and have children, but we're not
talking about later, we're talking about now, yes?)... if for no other
reason than it breathes more life into the story. Yes, I know she doesn't
play that much of a part in the book, but the book isn't -always- perfect...
yes? Personally, I think that Tolkien would have applauded the 1st movie...
no, I have no insight into the mind of the man, I'm only thinking if *I* had
written the book and then 60 or so years later had seen it on tape... I
think *I* would have been pleased, left-outs or no.

thanks,
Darklet
