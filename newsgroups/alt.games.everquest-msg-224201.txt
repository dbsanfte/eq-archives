    You're a plate class. BP availability is the suck for us.

    You got one of the better BP's out there. Things I would consider as a
cleric at your level, other than Skyshrine: Rublecrush BP, Burrower BP,
Cursed BP, Aten BP, Ornate BP, Rathe BP, the LDoN BP, the Grand Oracle quest
BP, Seru BP, Time BP. Unless you weren't at FT cap, I wouldn't go for a
Burrower tunic or Grand Oracle quest tunic. If I had Skyshrine already, I
wouldn't consider Rumblecrush, Ornate, or Rathe. That leaves Cursed, Aten,
LDoN, Seru, and Time.

    A lot of people don't realize how bad the choices are out there. Assume
everyone in your guild has a Velious-level BP or equivalent (Rumblecrush,
Ornate). Seru is dead from patch day onwards, usually by an overseas guild
overnight. Cursed can be killed by many, many guilds on a server, so finding
it up is quite difficult. VT is usually farmed by a rotation of guilds,
takes a ton of time to clear (with most of it being rot loot to an elemental
guild), and the BPs there are fairly rare drops. Most guilds don't farm
Rathe Council (mine does because of a lack of other targets), and the foci
on the Chestplate is something every cleric is going to have on their
elemental boots anyways. I'd consider the Rathe BP to be a plate tank BP,
not a cleric BP. So even though I can list a bunch of possible BPs, in
reality you won't see most of them.

    I personally wouldn't consider any of them worth the effort even if the
drops were more common. Your HP+MANA will go up by 30 or 40, but at the cost
of a balanced set of resists that is very hard to find in PoP. Not really a
worthwhile tradeoff.

    It also has a Specialization: Alteration mod on it. This is the only
mana preservation mod in the game that works on Complete Healing (as well as
any other heal you cast). Something to bring up with an officer when they
start blabbing about warriors being first for Time BPs.

    Warriors have the same issues with BP availability, so you aren't likely
to get much sympathy there. Many wear Vindi BPs for quite some time before
they see an upgrade.

    We made phase V last night, so we're about to find out if there's a
policy on Time BPs. ;-) Nothing has been said out loud yet. I know some
officers consider the plate BP to be a warrior item, but I've pointed out
the advantages for the clerics as well and hopefully it will come down to
who has the most time spent raiding.

    The LDoN BP is the one to go for if you want to take control of your
destiny and pass on raid BPs. The base stats are good enough to consider it
worth getting, and with the augs you can fill holes in your foci lineup and
boost the stats the BP is missing (resists). Instead of FT 2, for example,
you might want to add Spell Haste IV, or a buff extension augment. More
importantly, if you have a given foci on only one piece of gear, you can now
upgrade that piece of gear and get a new focus aug for the BP to avoid being
focus-locked. That's some nice versatility. Just remember, though, as soon
as your guild knows you're going for/have this BP they'll shut you out of
other BP drops.
