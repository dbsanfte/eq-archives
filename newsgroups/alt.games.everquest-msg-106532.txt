Hi all.  This may be a hybrid-specific question.  Well, I guess its
mostly for any class that can bind wound AND has a use for mana.  I
have always thought the bind wound skill was underrated.  I mean, at
lvl 50, I can bind for about 40 HP per bandage, which is not too bad. 
However, when I sat and punched out the numbers, I realized that in
the 10 seconds or so it takes to bind wound (when you are standing,
not medding), you could have med'd back more mana and just healed. 
Being a ranger, it is slightly more efficient to just med.  If you
were a druid or paladin, I imagie your heals are even more efficient,
and you would definately be better off medding.

Then it occured to me that while on a horse, you don't have to be
sitting to med.  As I understand, as long as you are on the horse and
stationary, and are NOT meleeing, you are medding.

Here is what I was wondering:  If I go and buy the cheapest horse, I
should still get the above mentioned effect.  When soloing, lets say I
fight till I'm about 1 bub of health and mana.  Instead of just
binding wound or just medding and healing, with the horse I could
combine the two.  I can bind wound to 50%, and STILL be medding all
that time.

Here is how it breaks down for me.  At lvl 52, I have approx 1500 HP. 
So 50% is 750.  Each bind wound takes 10 seconds, and heals for around
40HP (don't remember the exact number, but its about there).  So
4HP/second while binding wound.  750/4 = ~ 190s, or about 3 mins.

If I am on the horse, I can be medding those 3 mins, and STILL be
healing at 24HP/tick up to 50%.  That's faster than fungal tunic
regen!.  That is a huge reduction in down time.  Add to that the basic
HP regen of 5HP/tick, plus say the ranger buff Force of Nature
(3HP/tick I think) and I'd be regen'ing 32HP/tick WHILE medding, at
least up to 50%.

So....all of this is great IF:

1) You can bind wound while on a horse.
2) You will still be medding while binding while on a horse.

Seems it should be pretty easy to test this if someone has a horse
available.
Sit and med for 1 minute without the horse, and see how much mana you
get back.
Then get out the horsie, and bind wound constantly (i.e. no or very
little delay between bind-wounds) for 1 min.  If your mana regen is
the same, I think we've hit a proverbial pot of gold here for classes
that can bind wound.

Thanks for any/all info.
