I'm SO glad to hear that I'm not the only one doing the "/w all 40" type
searches.  I've tried recommending this to a few people and they just don't
get the concept.
I used it again the other night when I wanted to run the Wheel of Tarton
quest and need the groundspawn rod from the Hand room in LGuk.  Following
the same method above, I found out, from Highpass, that someone was there
and they'd be happy to lend a hand if needed.
