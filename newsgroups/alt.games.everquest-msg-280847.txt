Sadly you can sue for much stupider things. This case actually has 
merit.

Trust me, for small claims this is a actually pretty good. And probably 
a welcome diversion from the endless line of people hiring unqualified 
morons to renovate their kitchens and then suing the moron for what it 
cost them to have the original job fixed.

For one thing, the OP never indicated that he'd received a refund. So 
there are real damages there. 2nd The OP indicated that he'd purchased 
and attached expansions to the account. So there are additional real 
damages there. You can also sue for damages in terms of the loss of 
characters, although the numbers tend to be harder to quantify.

In the case of EQ, your job of quantifying damages is much easier - you 
can point to the difference in market value of the characters between 
when you bought and sold them, which IGE conveniently has lots of data 
for.

Either way, you can't really "lose". (although winning may not actually 
put you ahead financially).

If the court recognizes the sale of the account as a legitimate 
transaction, then they'll recognize the original owners re-possession of 
it as essentially as theft, and award you its computed value.

If the court does not recognize the sale of the account then it would 
have to at the very least award you what you paid for it. Because if it 
wasn't sold to you, what exactly does the original owner think he took 
your money for? And you'll have a good shot at being awarded the 
enhancements you made to the account (improving its value by adding 
expansions and even advancing its contents.)

The defendant can't claim it has no value, and that there were no 
damages in the face of IGE's marketplace which clearly assigns a value, 
in the face of the fact that he AGREED to a price, in the face of the 
fact that he TOOK YOUR MONEY.

Of course a trial is always a crapshoot on some level.

There's also a significant chance that the mere process of being served 
notice of the suit will be a wake up call to the original owner, 
especially if he's underage (and your suing the parents) or even simply 
lives at home.

Of course this all presumes you are in the same country. Its a royal 
pain in the ass to do anything internationally. You can do it, but it 
tends to cost a lot more and not be worth it (in terms of money). It 
might very well be worth it in terms of seeing justice served or your 
principles -- if you can afford it.

IANAL. This is not 'legal advice'. However, I've been sued, and so forth 
and been through the process a number of times. (For example The people 
who purchased one of my previous homes sued us a year after they took 
possession -- because the dishwasher broke. -- good example of the nutty 
things people can sue about. [PS No, they didn't win.])

As an alternative I'd contact SOE customer service and raise a major 
fuss. One reason they have this no transfer policy is in large part to 
avoid these fusses, so they won't be accomodating. However, even so, you 
can start by demanding refunds on any expansions that you purchased from 
them with *your* credit card, but to which they refuse to allow you to 
access. Of course they'll turn you down. Push your way through to 
management - write Letters (not email). Maybe be willing to settle for 
no refund, but having the expansions removed from the account.

At least depriving the scammer of the free account upgrades may give you 
some small satisfaction.
