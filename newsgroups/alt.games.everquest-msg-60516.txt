I quote the guidein question:
    Kill Lord Bergurgle, then turn in his "Lord Bergurgle's Crown" to
Shmendrik Lavawalker.

Lots of detail about Shmendrik, who spawns on a regular timer every 4 hours
and is not guarded by anyone.  Nothing about Lord Bergurgle, who is
apparantly a rare spawn surrounded by quite a few spell casters who range
from green to Cyan to me at 40.

I'm reminded of a recipee for Back Bay Bayou Bunny Bourdelais: First, get a
bunny.
Never went too well for Elmer Fudd, and "kill Lord Bergurgle" isn't going
too well for me.

The detail in this step leaves just a tiny bit to be desired, since I have
been trying to do this on and off for about 16 hours of play... including 6
today.  Since I can't do it solo, this means 32 wasted hours of people's
lives.  Not earth shattering, unless of course I'm doing something wrong!

Today I went in to the spawn with a druid friend, its inside the island on
which you find the tower with the mage with a pet.  In Wolf form, nooone is
KOS down there,
not even to Deep, who is a DE swimming mid tunnel.  At the end of the
tunnel is a huge open area, apparantly free of roamers.  In the center is a
tower.  There are Deepwater Goblins and Aguagoblins around the outside, and
more of the same  inside the base.  In the top of the tower, there are
three more Deepwater Goblins.

In the place of two of the top spawn, left and right, we occaisionally saw
Tainted Aquagoblins.  Unfortunately despite killing about 8 of these in the
six hours, none ever spawned the Corrupted Aquagoblin that the druids need
for their epic.  Supposedly the center of the trio is the one that
occaisionally spawns as Lord Bergurgle.

The Aquagoblins are very low level, so low that my ranger who I brought in
as a spotter sees some of them as blue at level 9.  Most DW Goblins are
green, but some cyan to my 53 cleric.  They range in class; druid, cleric,
wizard, warrior would be my guess from what they were casting, all carry
bow and arrow and aren't afraid to use them while approaching or if
rooted.  Nothing there is serious for a pair in their 50s,
but some stunning is likely in order to interrupt the otherwise annoying
casting.   Hmm, some of the regular Aquagoblins are Shaman, and killing
close to the tower resulted in them healing what we were killing even
though they were so green that they wouldn't actually frenzy to join the
fight.  Better to pull out a ways to avoid this nuisance.

Thats what I know, no idea if I'm doing the right thing though.  Someone in
Guild chat said that Lord Bergurgle spawns next to Deep!
