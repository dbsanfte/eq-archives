Lol... when I bought the box of LoY (because it was cheaper than the 
online download!) I pressed the purchase button at the loy screen 
thinking it would ask me for my 'code' and offer to sell me one if I 
didn't have it... imagine my irritation when it said... Thank you for 
your purchase. The end. No confirm, no this is gonna cost you, nothing.

Cost me an hour on the phone to get it sorted out. No way I was going to 
pay for the damned thing twice.
