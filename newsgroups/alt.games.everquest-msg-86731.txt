    I don't know about being the logical upgrades, but some items to look
out for would include:

Electrum Black Sapphire earrings (yes, really), the mask off Crystal Eyes in
Velk's, the Ac 15 STR/DEX 7 HP 40 bracer from Velk's, Crystal Chitin or
Cobalt Vambracers, Barbed Ringmail Tunic, Tattered Mantle, Spider Fur Cloak.
Those are all directly superior to what you are wearing in those slots now.
You may also look into going on raids to Hate or Kael arena - those armour
sets are quite nice, and what a warrior of your level is expected to have on
by others.
