I got that far in the quest a few levels ago, got the broken arrow, but had
to gate out before getting the gem, as the killer shark started munching on
me.  I think I was level 27 at the time.  I didn't know about him, or I
would have tried invis to animals.  I'll be getting back to that part of the
quest again sometime in the not too distant future, still have lots of time
before I can complete the quest anyway.  I actually started the quest quite
accidentally, killed Pegleg (I think that's who it was) in Butcherblock
Mountains, and the lesser spirit appeared.  Fortunately I had read up on the
epic, and recognized what was happening, even though it was not where
everything I read said it should start.  So I just slowly started doing bits
and pieces of it when I was in the appropriate area or had extra time to do
some solo exploring/adventuring.
