"Damage done" is NOT part of aggro.  How much damage a melee attack
(or DD spell) actually does has nothing to do with +hate.  The aggro
per swing (or per cast) is the same regardless of actual damage done,
even on a miss (or full resist) or a critical hit.  It does vary in
some way based on the potential damage, a level 60 gets more +hate
per swing than a level 6, even with identical weapons.  (This is not
true of heal aggro, which is affected by the amount healed.)
