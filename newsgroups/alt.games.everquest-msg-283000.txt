Truth be told, I'm just killing time until Vanguard is released. I 
wouldn't mind getting into the beta, but I don't care for the idea of 
playing through a buggy version of the game and then starting over a few 
months down the road.

So, in the meantime, I've fired up my EQ accounts to pass the time. I'm 
gonna play on a server where I already have a few characters though none 
are very high level, so twinking isn't really going to be much of an 
option.

I've got a mage up to level 12 or so, and am trying to decide on which 
class to compliment it with in a 2-boxing scenario. I got some really 
good insight from a thread Lance started way back when, but even after 
considering all the good points mentioned therein, I'm still having 
trouble deciding.

Some classes I've considered so far and my relative perspecives:

SHAMAN
Pros:
1) Heals
2) Buffs
3) Slows
4) Haste
5) Root (I've never been one to use root much outside of soloing though)
6) Pet (not the greatest, but extra DPS is extra DPS)
7) SoW
8) Potions
9) Can take a bit of a beating in tight situations
Cons:
1) I play a shaman main on another server
2) I can't imagine playing a shaman without constantly using canni. I 
would just feel I'm not being efficient otherwise. That said, it would 
make it a fairly busy class for 2-boxing.
3) Gawd, everyone 2-boxes a shaman :P

BEASTLORD

Pros:
1) Heals (minimal)
2) Buffs (some)
3) Slows (decent)
4) Self-haste (?)
5) Nice pet
6) Respectable melee DPS
7) Mana regen (somewhat and much later)
8) SoW (later)

Cons:
1) I've never been a huge fan of the beastlord class. Don't know why.
2) Would end up often tanking with poor man's gear and little healing. I 
wouldn't seem to make sense to choose a melee class that I would 
regularly need to back away from the fight.

ENCHANTER

Pros:
1) Mana regen (huge factor)
2) Crowd control (significant factor - would make them more time 
intensive, but when you need it, it's indespensible)
3) Haste
4) Slow
5) Buffs
6) Seudo pet (again, extra DPS is extra DPS)
7) Charmed pets (substantial DPS and HP at the cost of greater - though 
manageable - risk)
8) Root (I've never been one to use root much outside of soloing though)
9) Lull pulling
10) TASH (significant factor)

Cons:
1) Leaves the duo with the mage pet as the *only* tank option (even in 
emergency) and sole source of melee DPS (is that really an issue?)
2) I play a shaman (near-)main on another server.

NECROMANCER

Pros:
1) DoT's are just flat out wicked
2) Snare
3) FD pulling
4) Fear kite (though I've never been a big fan - could be useful in an 
emergency)
5) Capable pet
6) Mana battery (? Never played a necro very high, so am unfamilar with 
this ability)
7) Debuffs

Cons:
1) Leaves duo with pets as *only* tank option (even in emergency) - 
though fear is a last resort
2) "Twitching" may be time intensive
3) The necromancer class' famous ability to solo might leave me feeling 
that 2-boxing is holding this character back :P

SHADOWKNIGHT

Pros:
1) Effective tank class
2) Decent DPS (for a tank class)
3) Pet (feeble, but again, extra DPS)
4) Snare
5) Fear kite (eh /shrug)
6) FD pulling

Cons:
1) Would have to rely on taps and bind wound for any healing at all
2) Don't bring much other utility to the table

Anyone got any comments on these ideas or suggestions for other class 
options? I'm not necessarily worried about getting the most bang for my 
buck. I'm more concerned with what will feel right and be more fun while 
not being the worst possible combination, effort-wise.
