Ext. Range III item is a real help. The rest of the Focus items are really
not much use. Reagent save for pets only saves 1 silver, maybe 2. Summon
Haste works on pet but really is of no use. The affliction line only affects
the crappy DoTs we have.

Get int to 255 and +mana items. Cha keep over 115.
