You guys keep obsessing over the fact he had 124 days on the account.
Most people playing since 99 have that many but not even close to the
number of AA. That he acculumated 907AA in 124 days played is the holy
shit aspect. That had to be some xp grind. You're talking 7.3 AA per
day played.. and that doesn't include just levelling. Or one AA every
3.3 hours played.
