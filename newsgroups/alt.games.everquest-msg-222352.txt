> "upcoming productions"... you sure that's the right phrase? What exactly do you produce that needs freed up shelf space?<

Quite sure. We produce boardgames mostly, but role playing games as
well. In quantity, both gobble up quite a bit of storage space. We have
over 50 titles in print presently, but 3 of the larger board games
entering production early next year are going into a larger format and
hence cuasing some space concerns where storage is concerned.

Oh Darn. Hmm. A quick review of our online sales history tells me you
have never ordered a product from us in the past, so I guess we're not
out much...Just thought I would post our sale notice to this group
because many players of Everquest are also interested in table top RPGs
as well.
