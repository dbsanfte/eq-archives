I use a program called Nextstart (http://www.winstep.net). It has
built-in windows task management and it does allow me to click on the
task for EverQuest to get back into the game.

Occasionally I do get a ghosted mouse. It would be much better if I
could do what I need to do either from inside EQ or be able to
minimise and restore the window normally.
