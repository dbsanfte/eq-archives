Hey all,

According to Norton Anti-Virus the EQColor.exe I downloaded the other day
had a virus in it (Backdoor.SubSeven). Here's the virus definition from
Symantec:

>>>>Backdoor.SubSeven is a Trojan horse, similar to Netbus or Back Orifice.
It enables unauthorized people to access your computer over the Internet
without your knowledge.<<<<

Don't know if this has been mentioned yet (didn't have my virus protection
installed when I downloaded it...DOH!), but I thought it might bear
repeating.

I can't remember exactly where I got it from, but if my addled brain cells
recall correctly it was a fairly recent post in this NG.
