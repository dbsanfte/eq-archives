Subject: Unresolved Issue With A Quest


I spoke with a GM last night in game in regards to my problem and,
while I understand some of what he is saying, I am still a very
unsatisfied customer.  For the last nine months, I have been working
on my shaman epic. The majority of that time has been trying to find
help to go to the plane of fear for my tear.  After months of waiting
and asking around, I finally made it to Fear and successfully got one
along with another shaman in my guild. We attempted her turnin to Rak
on Sunday night and he ate her tear.  We attempted mine last night and
the same thing happened.  I did a /bug and /petition and eventually
was contacted by a GM.  Actually fairly quickly in my opinion, which I
appreciate.  I explained to him what happened and he asked me what my
faction was.  I told him Rak conned ally to me.  I explained to him
that I couldn't understand how that could be a problem as I had
meticulously over months of time researched every step of the quest
and done every single part with no skipping.  Including having to do
the test of patience 4 times because of the pathing bug.  I then told
him I had also done the Woe/Envy and Ghiosk parts a few extra times
because I had read on countless message boards  and usenet of shaman
losing out because their faction was not high enough.  It seemed that
everyone recommended at least doing a couple extra steps 'just to be
sure' my faction was high enough. Knowing full well that me getting to
Fear would be a long hardship, and not wanting to lose my tear if I
ever got one, I did just that. Well, in the end, the GM explained to
me that my turn in was eaten because my faction was too high.  Too
high?  I inquired, how could this be?  He explained to me that there
is a high/low range of faction for each part which I had never heard
of and how it is there to stop multiquesting and people skipping
parts.  Understandable, I see how it works now.  But I explained to
him that I did not cheat, I did not skip a single line of dialogue, I
had followed religiously for all these months through every step of
the quest.  He apologized and said that because I had done those extra
couple 'insurance' turnins that my faction was too high and I would
need to start over form the beginning.  He reset my faction to base
and apologized again about losing the tear. Don't get me wrong, I'm
not mad at this GM.  He's just doing a job.  But surely someone,
somewhere can see that this is not right?  I am 100% in support of
stopping cheating, MQ'ing, etc... and feel that if players want the
rewards, they should earn them.  However, I also feel that honest
people like myself, who have done all the work and invested all that
time should not have to suffer to stop the cheaters. 

A)  How does 'too high faction' figure in to anything lore wise?  The
true spirits like me too much to deal with me?  That would be like the
ToV mobs not talking to me because I had done too good a job of
killing their enemies in Kael.
B)  Why do I, an honest player, have to lose months of my hard
invested time, camping boring mobs for days hoping for drops, begging
someone to go to Fear with me, researching over and over, because Sony
wants to stop MQ'ing on this quest.  Meanwhile people MQ JBoots every
day and make thousands off of people too lazy to do the work
themselves.

The bottom line is, I love the game, I love the people I play with, I
love the lore that goes with the game and all those aspects of it.
But in the end, in it's simplest form, I play to have fun.  I am a
customer of Sony and I pay to be entertained and enjoy myself which I
have done for years. However, what happened last night truly saddened
me and cast an enourmous shadow over all the good times I have had.  I
feel like I have wasted months of my life because of a technicality
designed to stop cheaters.  Too bad you have to start over is not an
acceptable solution to this problem and I am not alone.  I talked to
several others who have experienced the same thing with this quest. I
asked if I could at the least get my tear back, even if I had to reset
my faciton and start over, at least I would not have to wait again to
go back to Fear.  Even this, to me, would not make up for all the
wasted time, but would at least show an effort on SOE's part.  I was
denied because he said I still wouldn't be able to do the turn in if I
tried again. I explained that I understood that, but it would help me
in going through all the steps again not to have to go back to fear,
especially considering that there is no faction involved in actually
getting the tear.  Still I was denied.
 
And now I sit, disheartened and disillusioned with my hand empty when
it should be holding my Spear Of Fate.  I put in the time, I did the
research, I did the recruiting, I did the work.  And yet I have no
reward.  Again, I say, essentially telling me 'too bad, start all
over' is not an acceptable solution.  I was not trying to cheat the
game, and I don't appreciated being cheated by it.  If you truly care
about making the game enjoyable to the honest players, something has
to be done about this quest before it happens time and again to good,
loyal customers such as myself.  I am not asking for special
treatment.  I am asking for the reward to a quest that I completed.
Thank you for your time.

Greetings Brian,

This is Lead Gm Salonafinn responding to your email on the issue with
the faction and your shaman epic.  I understand your concern in this
matter.  I know that it can be worrisome to try to get these types of
issues clearly resolved.  First I understand about the pathing issue
with the first npc in the shaman epic.  That was a known issue and
however annoying it was not something that would have messed up your
faction.  That issue was resolved as quickly as possible.  Now, as to
your next issue.  Woe and Envy.  These items are handed in multiple
times in an attempt to get the epic with out completely the quest
completely and correctly.  This is not a bug.  Handing in these items
multiple times will result in a failure of the final turn in. This is
what happened to you.  I am sorry, but you failed the quest.  You
must complete the quest correctly to receive your epic.

At this point you need to start the quest again and complete it from
start to finish, with no multiquests and no extra turn ins.  Follow
the verbiage in the quest and you should be able to get your epic.

I hope I have answered your question clearly and consisely.

Safe Travels to You,
~Salonafinn~

That is NOT correct and I resent the fact that you are accusing me of
that.   As I stated several times, I completed all the quests, every
step of the way.  The additional turnins were done because I was
warned by several players, websites and newsgroups that it wa a good
idea to make sure your faction was high enough.  It took me forever to
get the tear and I didn't want to take the chance of losing it.  I
stated multiple times to the other gm and in my letter to you that
this was the case.  I don't know if there is any way for you to verify
this or not because I don't know what is logged on your servers.  But
this is totally insane.  I realize you think I am lying but I am not
and will do anything I can to verify that I did the other parts. 
 
I am very disappointed with this whole issue, as a paying customer who
has never once cheated, never taken advantage of an exploit, and even
reported people who were exploiting things.  To be accused of cheating
or trying to cheat is not something I take lightly.  I realize I am
totally at the mercy of the gm's and obviously not going to get help.
But to have you flat out tell me that I was cheating is very
disappointing to me.  At this point I realize that I am going to get
no help from SOE and truthfully, I will probably just forget my epic.
There's no way I'm going to go through all that again for that much
time.  Not after being burned this badly on it.  I just think it's a
sad statement that with all the people ebaying everything form items
to accounts, everything possible being multiquested for money, and the
countless exploits happening every day that someone who spends this
much time and completes every step loses out because they did a couple
extra turnins to make sure the faction was high enough.  And then on
top of it all is insulted by a customer service supervisor.  That just
totally amazes me.

Her Final Response:

Greetings Brian,

This is Lead Gm Salonafinn responding to your email on the Shaman Epic
item.  We apparently were not on the same page.  In your email you
seem to feel as though I am accusing you of something when that it not
the case.  I simply stated that there are those players out there who
have used multiple turn ins of Woe and Envy items in an attempt to
fraudulently complete the quest.

I did not say that you did that. 

What I did say to you is that you will need to start your epic quest
over again because you need to complete the quest completely and
correctly.  There are other players who have also needed to complete
the quest again.

Handing in one item out of order, or duplicate times will infact make
you fail the quest.  Your multiple hand in of the items Woe and Envy
negated the quest.  Meaning, you could not complete it.  GM Vaylin
erased your faction so that you could at least start the quest over if
you chose to do so.

I do apologize that you feel as though I have not heard your issue and
worse yet, chosen not to act on it.  If this were a bugged NPC issue
or something that we assisted with I would be more than happy to get
you back on your way.  We have done what we can do for players in your
position.  Your faction is reset and you can now start your quest as
though you never failed
it.

I hope that I have answered your question complete and I hope that I
have at least cleared up your misunderstanding of my previous email.

Safe Travels to You,
~Salonafinn~

Ok, I know that's a lot to read but I needed to vent.  This has gotten
me totally upset.  I for one cannot believe that I am being treated
this way.  Am I totally nuts?  I guess at this point it's over.  Who
wants their epic anyway.  Oh yeah, I did  =/
