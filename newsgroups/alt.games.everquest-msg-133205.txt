}faction work?  TIA

Such a list would also depend on your character's religion and class.

Agnostic DEs will find more merchants than Innoruukian, although Innoruuk 
followers get better prices in Neriak on average.  Chanter/Mage/Wizard 
Seem to have the most, except Rogues who can use sneak to be indifferent 
to all merchants.  Clerics I'm not sure, SKs and Necs will have a much 
harder time.

I believe you may be able to shop in parts of qeynos, and definitely the 
aqueducts, in addition to the other merchants mentioned.  And the guys 
just outside of Oggok in the Feerrott.  (Three cheers for Bup! :) )
