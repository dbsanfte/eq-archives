Hmmm, one badly timed dispell is very bad.

However, there are at least 3 other EB effect items:

1.  Lodizal shell shield (also a cloak).  Always load on Lodizal.
2.  Turtle ring (forget the actual name, but comes off Lodizal as
well).
3.  No drop fishing pole from Siren's Grotto.  Comes off random
seahorses....what the heck they are doing with a fishing pole, I don't
know.

All three items give you EB effect.  1 & 2 are droppable but good luck
finding one for sale...an AC23, 10 STR/WIS cloak ain't gonna be up for
sale much.
