You'd be KoS in Paineel to the guards and such, but that isn't much of a
problem, they're perma rooted and green to a level 16.

Everybody's KoS to the Kobolds, although, my warrior friend who worships
Rallos Zek was Threatening initially (then we slaughtered them), in 3 levels
or so, my tree hugger of Tunare has gone from dubious to indifferent with
High Guard of Erudin, and Scowling to...  Scowling to the guys in Paineel,
my warrior partner has gone from Scowling to Dubious with Paineel.
Although, I was turning in all the molars we got in Erudin, as well as
killing Noclin Saah a couple times, hehehe.

Now, dammit, why won't my DeepwaterKnights faction go up?!?!
