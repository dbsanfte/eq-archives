Blech. Not to mention they didn't sound at all like a git, they sounded 
like a person intelligent enough to seek help when they were unsure, and 
like a person who *had* done right (well except for not booting that 
idiot warrior out as soon as he started being more interested in loot 
than a living, breathing group ;p) using just their instincts.

To the OP: /assist is your best friend.  Do NOT assist right away, I've 
found warriors have a terrible habit of switching mobs once they get 
back, and all of a sudden you've got something pounding on you when 
you're supposed to be behind it.  It's best to wait a couple swings 
anyway, so the tank can build up a bit of hate, so wait until he turns 
and starts to fight, *then* smack your /assist hotkey (you have one set 
up, yes? :)) and move in and start hurting.

Evade is your second best friend, and used when something suddenly 
notices that it's getting a *heck* of a lot of damage inflicted on it's 
back (or butt, or thigh, or ankle, depending on what you're fighting :)) 
and turns around to find you there.  I didn't know about evade until 
quite late on and would just back up - but as soon as I ran in I'd grab 
the hate again.  Got very frustrating very fast.  Evade, in case you 
don't know, is turning off attack, hitting 'hide', then turning attack 
on again.  You'll get a message telling you that you either successfully 
evaded or didn't - and sometimes that pause is just enough to get the 
aggro off of you even if you don't succeed.  But it's much faster than 
backing up and allows you to get back to doing damage again.

Just so you know, protecting the cleric is all well and good (and find 
in a group of three as you described, since the tank obviously wasn't 
doing his job), but make sure to train yourself to NEVER NEVER EVER stop 
assisting the main tank unless told to.  The casters are able to take 
care of themselves and there is often a caster watching for just that 
sort of problem.  Nobody likes a mez-breaker.  Your job is to help the 
main tank take down the mob he (or she) is working on.  The only time to 
worry about protecting your casters is if you're in a melee-heavy group.  
At which point, good luck to the mobs TRYING to get to the casters *g* 
I've been in a group with 5 melees and 1 cleric, and it was just not 
pretty for anything that popped.  (OTOH I've been in a caster-heavy 
group, too.  Especially with wizards, you often will not use that 
backstab button more than once or twice a fight :))

Grouping is VERY nice with the right group, and it's inevitable that 
you'll find good groups out there.  It's also inevitable that you'll 
find bad groups.  Eventually you'll start to recognize names and back 
WAY off when you see certain people in a group, or try hard to get in 
for others.  It's a mixed bag, but although I started out loathing the 
need to group in EQ, I've really come to appreciate it as a way to have 
a great time.  I just wish there was a way to press a button and have 
the group I want ready and waiting to go when I logged in ;)
