Well like the original poster i had high hopes for DOAC and I went out and
purchased it the day it came out. I like many of the ideas and tech updates
they had done but the gameplay was just lacking somewhere. I really cant put
my finger on it but it just didnt have that polished feel like EQ. I used up
my free 1 month subscription in DoaC and then quit. I am now back to eq
100%.
