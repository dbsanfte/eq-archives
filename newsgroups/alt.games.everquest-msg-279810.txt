Skillup sucks a lot more now than before the revamp a few months ago.
Max for Necro's spell is 200.

I remember when I first heard abouy the rumored skillup nerf, I sat
down and did nothing but grind on my BL.  Got baking to 300 after
nearly 4,000 MTP's (most ended up in guild bank and left on ground
around PoK) and also got my tailor to 300.  one week later several
people on EQTraders forum were bitching and moaning about SoE nerfing
skillup on most tailoring from 300+ to 250 or less and forcing the
expensive or hard to find DoN cultural as the only tradeskill skillups
on some races.

I got my brewing up to 300 and fletching to 252 shortly after that.
