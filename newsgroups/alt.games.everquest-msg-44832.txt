Well, you have no stat at under 75 ( devastatingly bad things
happen with stats under that level, on occaision ) so that's likely
not the trouble.

Defense seems to go up based on the level of the mob relative
to you, and not much else.  Mob hitting you or not doesn't
seem to make any difference.  Your AC doesn't seem to
make any difference either.

On my second cleric, I assiduously applied the playing
skills I'd acquired the first time around in order to control
aggro, did it so well that my Defense was at about 19 when
I hit level 30.  I had to work, and work hard, on getting
my Defense up.  Did a good deal of soloing low blues, (I'd
root em and go in and melee till I was hurt bad, then back
off and heal myself, had SOW from potions as a backup plan)
which was OK, but defense went up better when I
grouped with understanding buddies who would let
me get beat on by high blues and even yellows which
were already damaged almost to the point of running
and in controlled situations.

Better still was getting my defense PL'd by getting high level
AC/HP buffs on so I could take prolonged poundings from
yellow to me mobs.  Red to me mobs didn't give noticably
better skill ups, but -did- hurt me faster, so I stayed away from
them.

Hmm, you should be looking for mobs that hit a lot, for
relatively small damage, rather than the slower harder hitting
variety, all things being equal.

Another approach for me was to drag a -lot- of low blues
to the zone line and let em beat me nearly to death, then
zone.  Practice alteration on the flip side and then med up,
good to zone back in and repeat.  You aren't a healer, but
you could practice bind wounds...
