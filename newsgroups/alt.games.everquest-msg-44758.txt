    I'm in one of those situations where I simply do not know what to do.
I've
been playing everquest for a couple months now and I had managed to get
Velix my troll shadowknight to lvl 19.  I was havin a great time with the
char but then fell upon hardtimes.  I was headed to kunark for the first
time and a friendly druid gave me a port to DL.  =( little did I know what I
was getting into.  Being my first time in kunark I was very disoriented and
died to a yeti or something.   I tried for so many h ours to get that corpse
back but first of all getting to DL again (I was bound at the time in oggok)
was a lesson in frustration and finnally once I got there I simply could not
find it.  To make a long story short I quit EQ in sadness. Now I realize I
gave up to quick and had a bad attitude and have returned and plan on
staying for the long haul.

Problem is I wasn't In a guild and have no other chars (higher then lvl 3),
so basically I'm a naked troll sk.  Now I'm by no means begging...  but any
help would be amazing.  I had such good equipment, mith 2h and all.
Anything just to get on my feet (fs 2hander and some banded or something)
would be incredible and I would be glad to pay you back once I get the
money.  Thanks for your understanding and for not flaming me (in advance),
I'm just a nasty evil troll sk who wants to get back to doing what he does
best, murder and mayhem =)

I play on The tribunal.   please reply by email or in newsgroup.
Thank you very much.
