So tell us Biz, how many children have you raised?  I find myself
questioning your intelligence here, I've yet to meet a 5 year-old
who _couldn't_ delete a character from the EQ character selection
screen in a matter of seconds, whether he'd ever used a computer
before or not.

You've posted an awful lot lately slamming others parenting skills
(sometimes with justification), but you've yet to show the slightest
indication that you have the slightest clue what child raising
actually involves.  Here's a hint for you:  Even if it were possible
to anticipate every imaginable way in which little Johnny might
inconvenience you, you couldn't prevent them all.  And if you make
the mistake of placing the same emphasis on "don't play with the
computer" that you do on "don't play with the stove" all you're
gonna do is undercut the importance of the latter in the kid's
mind.  Kids make mistakes, and they do things they shouldn't, that's
life and that's how they get into situations where they can learn
lessons.  And no amount of ranting by some self-righteous misanthrope
is gonna change that.
