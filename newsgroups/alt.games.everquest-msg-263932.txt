Oh . . . my . . . GOD!!!

Sniff, I never knew that you *really* looked on me as little more than a 
lowlife troll. :-(

I'm simply . . . mortified . . . I guess . . . I guess I'll . . . just eat 
some worms . . .

chainbreaker-aka Jerry (Toby) Morelock--it's been on the net before, won't 
hurt for it to be on the net again--gosh, Ross . . . it feels really really 
. . . great, coming clean like that :-)

If you need to email, then chainbreaker (naturally) at comcast dot
net--that's "net" not "com"--should do it.
