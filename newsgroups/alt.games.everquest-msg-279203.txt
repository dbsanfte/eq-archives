I don't think that the suggestion was for scaling instanced encounters.
 Loral was pointing out that the experience gained from the encounter
was determined purely from level and that this is a problem.  I think
that the suggestion was that a mob that conned blue to a single-group
equiped character may con light-blue or green to a raid equipped
character and so would give less experience when defeated.  This would
also work with twinking - the twinks would not be able to power-level
due to their great gear - they would have to defeat tougher encounters
to get the same experience as a non-twinked character.
