    I ended up having mixed feelings about the guild we started on Test
server.  On one hand, I have never been in a guild before where I such
complete confidence in each and every other member, nor do I expect to
again.  It was a nice feeling knowing that there were no "bad apples". 
But, the problem came from the nature of the AGE group itself.  We were,
for the most part, a guild of alts.  People might have been taking a
break from their mains for a bit, but soon they were anxious to get back
to their mains (understandably so).  We tried to get around this by
setting up one night as the guild raid night, and picked Monday as the
agreed upon day.  Unfortunately, Monday's also seemed to be the day that
Sony picked at the one to randomly crash the server.  We had more than
one hunt cancelled because the damned server wouldn't stay up.  But in
the end, I think that guild would have failed even if the server had
been rock solid.  We just didn't have enough "main players" to keep
going.

   So... I dunno if I would really like to try it again on FV.  Yes, it
would be cool.  Yes, it would be nice to have that complete confidence
back that I had with the AGE guild on Test.  But it was hard to see the
guild breaking up as people drifted back to their home servers.  Even
with the recent "invasion", I don't think we have the numbers to keep
such a guild going.
