actually, the law itself doesn't understand the difference...

taken from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement_of_software
:


# Buying the original software. Licenses never say that the buyer does
not buy the software but instead pays for the right to use the
software. In the US, the first-sale doctrine, Softman v. Adobe [1] and
Novell, Inc. v. CPU Distrib., Inc. ruled that software sales are
purchases, not licenses, and resale, including unbundling, is lawful
regardless of a contractual prohibition. The reasoning in Softman v.
Adobe suggests that resale of student licensed versions, provided they
are accurately described as such, is also not infringing.



so i do own the thing that i paid for (the copy of the game),
according to at least some people whose job it is to decide what is
and isn't the law

there's a legal distinction between saying i'm contractually
prohibited from using the software to connect to another machine and
saying i'm statutorily prohibited from connecting to another machine

then again, i don't actually think i'm the dense one, so maybe we can
take this discussion to someone who can arbitrate our legal issue
