What part of "when you're not focused don't render 3d" do you not get?  A
hint, that feature is *not* controlled by the "max background FPS" setting
in the INI.  I'm relying on *your* quote here, the info *you* chose to quote
him as saying.

We can either assume he meant the framerate limiter, as the "max background
FPS" setting controls, or use some logic and assume that when he said "when
you're not focused don't render 3d" he meant exactly that and didn't know
(and probably didn't *care*) which setting controlled it, as long as it
worked, like the vast majority of computer users.

Talk about a nonsequitur.

FYI fire is hot...   =P

Not in the slightest.  I just assume from experience that most people
couldn't care less what INI variable names are or be bothered to be sure
they're talking about the right one, but when they describe the feature,
*that* is the feature they are talking about.  I.E., "when you're not
focused don't render 3d".

Interpreting something exactly as it's written as a *whole* constitutes
logic.  Your method constitutes something else entirely.

The hole is definitely getting deeper.  =P

I have a feeling if I didn't repond to this last line you'd give up and go
away, since I'm sure you already realize the error in your "logic".  But
it's a boring rainy day in a boring dreary office, so I must.
