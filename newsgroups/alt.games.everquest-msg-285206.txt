Repatch started at about 4:30pm EST, scheduled for an hour and a half... 
with a whole 13 minutes warning.

Luckily the group I was with were all casters, so I hauled out the 
Worker's Sledgemallet, hammered out, they mezzed my target and all gated 
out.

Sad thing is our target was a rarely up epic mob, which happened to be 
up and was spotted on tracking; we were more than 13 minutes from 
getting down to him and killing him though.

Ah well, c'est la vie, eh?

Berg, 60 SK Combine
