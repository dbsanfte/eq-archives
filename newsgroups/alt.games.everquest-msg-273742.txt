Yes, although, if by "level" you mean XP level, only indirectly.

Right-click the item and choose Examine. The skill and levels required to
use and master it are listed there.

Compare with your own skill list (press L). Unlike the skills you have to
practice (e.g. Defense), these ones (e.g. Great Sword) increase
automatically as you XP level, but I don't know the formula. Maybe someone
else here does?

At last it should be easy enough to tell if you're close or not.
