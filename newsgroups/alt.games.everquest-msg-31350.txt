Someone trains the language as much as possible at guild, then spams
another. The other person will learn trained+1, spams the first
player, who will gain 2 points. He spams the second again, who gains
another 2 points, ad nauseum.

The key is that you can train someone in a language to a skill one
point higher than your own.
