Thanks!  I will have to check when I get home but I have a 21" monitor and I
run at at least 1280 X 1024 but maybe higer.  I know that this is not the
resolution that I set EQ to - even with the chat font set to 5 - the type
was too small to read at higher resolutions.  heh, guess I need to tinker!
