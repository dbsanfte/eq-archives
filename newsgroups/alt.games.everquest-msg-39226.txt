    I was thinking the exact same thing. They've made them look more like
"defined" versions of the original models - added more detailed muscles,
that sort of thing, instead of the "re-thinking" the first models
represented. Now I imagine the "new look" will become quite popular,
assuming the armour/weapon graphics aren't totally bonkers. The weapons look
pretty slick in these pics, anyways.
