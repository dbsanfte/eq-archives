I suppose I should mention that as a result of my rather vehemently
expressed opinions on this subject, I have had some interesting private
conversations with some folks on the ins and outs of twinking and why a
reasonable and honorable person might want to do so. It has also gradually
dawned on me that perhaps the differences between a massively multiplayer
online RPG and a tabletop RPG might be such that a modification of my ideas
of fair play in EQ might be in order.

I'm not saying I'll twink. But if people take the effort to converse in a
civil manner, I listen to them even when I disagree with them, and this
means my opinions are subject to modification as time goes on. I pointed
this fact out rather early on in the discussion, and as it turns out this
may well be one of those times.

Just figured I say that.
