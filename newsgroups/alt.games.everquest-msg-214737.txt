Get off your butt, put up your LFG flag and find a group of your level.

i have a main at 55, and a passel of lower level alts ranging from a 
baby cleric of 10, to a ranger of 31. I never group until i am about 20 
as I find it easier to solo with a temperence the Shar Val pit until 5, 
then move to the baby end of Paludal until 14, then slide into the SH 
end of Paludal and solo the shroom/single phlarg spawn at the lakeshore 
where the bottom of Phlarg hill is. I can solo them while tradeskilling 
between spawns until  basically 20...arrows, tailoring subcombines, 
making celestial essense combines in a mortar and pestle...chatting with 
friends and healing random crud victims. Then at 20, get into a bandit 
group and polish your grouping skills...at 25 move to Netherbian Lair 
for a few levels then to Marus Seru until about 28.

Now, with LDoN, I plan on at 20 moving into LDoN groups...heck with the 
spam and KS whinges in all the other zones, I started Susique on Sol Ro 
just for LDoN grouping with 5 other friends...who knows, she may become 
my main=)

I do know that the xp in LDoN is excellent. I think it compares 
favorably with planar xp, and the ability to have a private dungeon is 
more than enough incentive to have the expansion....
