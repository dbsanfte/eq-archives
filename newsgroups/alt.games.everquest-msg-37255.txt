And herein lies the difference of perception. It comes from coming at
this question from coming from totally different gaming experiences. You
commented that you primarily play a druid, soloing, and being in remote
areas. So I could see where you could have that experience. I, on the
other hand, will readily admit to being spoiled. Ever since I got my
highest level character to a level where I started actually worrying
about finding a rez, I've been grouped with a rez capable cleric. Never
even log on without her. So yeah... I'm spoiled.
  As to the attitude towards the original poster, yes. If you're going
to not even bother adventuring, but rather go sit in a zone hoping
you're the only rez capable cleric and *advertising* rezzing for 100
plat, then I think you drop into the "loser" bucket, and even I might
walk away and suck up the loss if my cleric partner wasn't around for
some reason.
