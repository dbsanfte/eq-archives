i checked it out and yes the link didn't work the first time but if you
cycle to the previous page with their buttons and then back you will see it.
strange looking thing, the second slot is being used as a vent for the fan's

i think i might be going for the ATI card when it drops in price...

that's mu 50 cents worth, awesome question Chris ;-)
