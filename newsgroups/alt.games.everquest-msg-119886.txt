I think we have a new worlds record in Jumping to Conclusions.

How, exactly did you manage to get that out of what I said?  Or did
you just want to get the 'subtle' dig in there at expense of a real
point?

I said that if someone is going to be asking for 'donations' for a
port, they best not be surprised when people don't give them what the
porter thinks is a fair price.

No it isn't.  Explain to my WHY ports automatically cost 10 to 20
plat?

Nice attack.  Do you have a point?

No, I have a problem with people who ask for 'donations', which is
basically a gift, for port, then get pissy when said gift doesn't meet
their high standards.

Hypersensitive much?
