It's an indicator of how far you are in the current yellow bubble.  For
example, if you're 3/5 of the way through your second yellow bubble, you'll
see one yellow bubble and a little bit of your second yellow bubble filled,
and the blue line all the way through the third bubble.

You'll often hear players that they have "three blues" until they level.
That means that they have four yellow bubbles filled and the that blue line
is all the way through the second bubble, with 3/5 of the bubble yet to be
filled.

It's also a great way to see exactly how much XP per monster you get.  If
you have your Persona display up as you or your group kills a monster, you
can see the blue line move and how much the current monster was worth to
you.  Since this is obviously dangerous, best is to look at the blue line
before you start the fight and compare it to where it ends up after the
fight.

The most I've ever gotten is one full blue bubble from tag-teaming a red
brute in WW.

Hope this explanation isn't too confusing - perhaps someone else will make
this more clear.  :)
