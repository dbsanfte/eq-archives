You need to add your own pauses to the below ...


                              Elrond
                        As you can see, we've had our eye
                        on you for some time now, Mr.
                        Baggins.

        He opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he
        flips several pages.  Frodo cannot tell if he is looking at
        the file or at him.

                                        Elrond
                        It seems that you have been living
                        two lives.  In one life, you are
                        Frodo Baggins, Hobbit
                        of the Shire.  You have a social
                        security number, you pay your
                        taxes and you help your Bilbo
                        carry out her garbage.

        The pages continue to turn.

                                        Elrond
                        The other life is lived in the
                        magic world where you go by the
                        alias ringbearer, and are guilty
                        of virtually every computer crime
                        we have a law for, including the
                        unauthorized use of the One Ring
                         for the removal of visibility.

        Frodo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.

                                        Elrond
                        One of these,lives has a future.
                        One of them does not.

        He closes the file.

                                        Elrond
                        I'm going to be as forthcoming as
                        I can be, Mr. Baggins.  You are
                        here because we need your help.
