What can I say, I'm on vacation and bored.  I have to admit there is
an ugly side to this, its like watching one of my geckos eat at
superworm and chew on it for a while without killing it right away.

The morbid fascination with squirming things aside, I actually have
learned a few things form observing EQ.  Despite his best efforts he
did bring up a few interesting things.  It has added to my
observations about why some people jump on the "special rights"
bandwagon.
