This I disagree with.

In EQ you have X inventory slots to fill. So when you get a new item it 
is almost always a case of being either:

 <an upgrade displacing existing item, or gratz rot>

Now the doll is good enough that for nearly everyone under 60... and a 
large number of people over 60 as well its an upgrade. That makes the 
doll pretty amazing.

The downside is its just used up a slot on all those characters that 
won't be displaced for a very long time. Thus effectively moving a huge 
chunk of existing content to the gratz rot category.

A much better item would have been a ring with 5 charges of Rez without 
rez effects. Its still uber and nearly everyone would want one, but it 
wouldn't really interfere with the game long term. (I'd limit it to one 
per character, like the scavenger hunt).
