I'm not talking necessarily raiding. Even normal xp grouping, this is
true.

Okay, that's BS. Tackling bigger fights isn't acting more stupidly if
you have better capabilities of surviving the fight. Solo tanking,
more HP means I can take a bigger mob without having to bail and heal
and survive. Or, it means that the survival chances in an unforeseen
nasty situation become that much greater. If I have twice the HP, that
means I can last about twice as long running while the mobs are
beating on my back, thus greatly increasing my chance of reaching
safety.

Your logic here could apply to buffs for any stat, AC, or ATK. THey're
all limited in their usefulness by the tactics used by the player.
Overall, though, I'd say HP have the greatest benefit.
