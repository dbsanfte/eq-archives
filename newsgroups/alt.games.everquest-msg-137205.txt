Wrong.  The former owner of the gear was not in the game, and so
had no possible claim on it.  You can rant until you're blue in the
face, but it won't alter the fact that your accusation of theft is
false.  Make an accusation like that on a public channel in-game and
you could have action taken against your account.  Make an equivalent
accusation in public in RL and you could find yourself on the losing
side of a lawsuit.

Nice is another matter entirely.
