Calling someone Cinderella is to accuse them of living in a fantasy land 
(ie, the one she was in during the dance, before everything reverted).  If 
you didn't understand that, you could have just asked.

Have you ever read Snow White?  Maybe Rapunzel would be a better choice?  If 
you're going to lecture me on my knoweldge of fairy tales, perhaps you 
should read them yourself?

You just acknowledged that calling him Cinderella was an expression, and now 
you go back to the butchering metaphors thing.  You really are a piece of 
work.

And where is it misplaced?  I'm not the one going around lecturing people 
about their presumed misuse of fairy tale lore while messing it up myself 
(that really was a classic, thank you for giving me the chance to laugh 
about it).  I'm not the one who acknowledges that something is an 
expression, but doesn't understand it, and so launches into an attack 
instead of asking the person to explain.  And the funny part is, it wasn't 
you I was insulting in the beginning.  You had to go out and prove your 
stupidity on your own.
