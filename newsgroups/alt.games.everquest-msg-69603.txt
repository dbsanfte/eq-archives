Very true... Verant jumped the gun on SOL...thier mistake...

just FYI I learned Basic on a TRS-80 (The Radio Shack-4k) when it was the
tops with no disk drive, tape only. Bypassed the TI-99 (Texas
Instruments/first color home computer). Played a little with Apple II's (yuk
imho). Learned how to code in machine language (ML-6502/6510 aka ASM or
Assembly (which ASM is a ML script client really)) on an Atari 400 (16k woo!
& tape drive), skipped the pre 64 (can't remember its name right now) and
then a Commodore 64 (64k, god that was a great and fun computer) without
using books but just lists of ROM calls (aka poke/peek in Basic)... I did
almost all of my coding straight through freezeing memory and doing it by
hand instead of using an assembler. In fact I used a paper clip to freeze
memory on the C=64 before there were any freeze cartridges so I could figure
out how games are coded. Some of my younger days of coding on the C=64's
code (as well as my friends in the scene) can be found in professional games
(mainly NTSC fixing of PAL games). Our code was  stolen by the US companies
to release a "US" version of a European game. Same thing went on in the
Amiga scene. Done some programing on PC's which I wont go into what I did
and found it similar to 6510 (ml is ml is ml) but with mem pages, so many
differences and extremly more complicated etc albiet the differences between
ROM based computers vs OS since 3-486's/Amiga/Atari ST/Mac style. I am a
programmer and a tech btw...
Have a great X-mas...
