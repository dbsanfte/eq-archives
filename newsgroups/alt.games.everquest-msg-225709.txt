From the shadows, the mysterious enigmatic300@yahoo.com (The Enigma)
(if that IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Aren't bards fully capable of swarm kiting by then?

I've seen a screenshot of the best swarmkiting bard on test's chat box
once - it was *completely filled* with yellow exp gain messages. Test
being test he can get the entire zone of Nadox to himself - and he
kills it.

All of it. 

In one or two pulls.

No group can even come remotely close to that level of kill rate. It's
not even a contest. The ae groups of old in shadowhaven were maybe
comparable, but they're no longer possible.

That's okay, LDoN is shitty exp.

They will, but PoD, like all the tier 1 PoP zones, isn't particularly
good exp - roughly comparable to LDoN once you count the screw around
time in that.
