This isnt anything new, I use this ummm.. well its not an exploit. well
anyways I use this to help find fish for the druid epic in LoIO, or whenever
im searching underwater or getting around sirens in CS...
just go to the borderline where water and air are, if you position your
pitch right, you can see everything... also, it helps to keep autorun on,
and turning can help you adjust it if your pitch is right but youre too high
up, and also, tapping the autorun button twice quickly can lower you a
bit... hope that helps, you're in my world now....
