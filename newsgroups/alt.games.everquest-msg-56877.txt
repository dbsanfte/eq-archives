Turns out your comments are totally incorrect.  I said "probably immediately
move," I didn't say "would definitely move," as you seem to think I implied.
I have not tried to port people to a zone in which I did not have a key from
every zone in the game.

As to your DL comments, hopefully this will clear it up for you:

If you are in Dreadlands at Karnors Castle and you do not have a GD tooth
but your groupmate does and you cast GD port, the groupmate will go to GD.
You will be moved (I think...it's been a while) to near the Dreadlands druid
ring and you will not be able to sit down (so no medding, no camping) or
cast spells.  Since it's a minor bug I doubt if Verant has gotten around to
fixing it, but it's possible that by now they have.
