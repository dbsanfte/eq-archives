You're GUESSING it'll produce those behaviors.  You don't KNOW it
will.  I don't see ANY good reason why people won't behave the same in
WoW as they do in EQ: respect the fact that you were at the camp spot
first, and leave.  Like EQ, WoW is an MMORPG, and faction with your
fellow human players will be at least partially important.

The reason I believe you were MISLED into thinking it'd produce those
behaviors is because of the crowds.  Much like the Stromm server
newbie zones for the first few weeks after Stromm went live.

A lot of the Battle.net kiddies are only there because it's a free
service.
