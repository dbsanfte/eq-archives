Operative words - *may* and *next*

Doesn't do much for level 49-60 mages competing against melee with
access to LDoN weapons that are vastly better than the ones that were
around when I was a competitive DPS class with an epic'd ranger 
(55ish around 2 years ago).

Also doesn't do much for me competing against that same ranger for
DPS now.  I have to suspend/canni aggressively to keep my DPS up to
his level.

It also doesn't do anything for mages in raids where they already can't
outdamage a wizard and are just competitive with other DPS classes
(with canni).
