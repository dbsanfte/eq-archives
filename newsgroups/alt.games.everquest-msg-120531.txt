Apprently, the icon thing didn't hit everyone. Someone in my guild was
totally lost when the rest of us were talking about it. Everything
looked normal to him. Not sure what the determining factor was...

The coin drops in CB were an easy miss, really. Like I said, they
can't go in and do some kills in every zone before bringing the
servers back up to check the loot tables. Could have been a totally
unrelated change that caused it. Patching can be unpredictable at
times...
