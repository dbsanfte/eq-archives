From what I recall when my friend was involved in the beta testing (which
became open beta after about 1 week) the game was going to be D/L on
subscription, so you never bought any software, only subscribed.
Whether this is how the game was finally released I have no idea, everyone
of my friends involved lost interest in it pretty fast, I believe it also
went live in Germany long before anywhere else helped this along, so I heard
nothing else about it.

Looked incredibly dull to me, not the depth of any of the current MMORPG's
and not the excitement of an FPS.
An FPS player going to Neocron may have found it fulfilling, if they were
looking for that sort of thing but an EQ, DAoC, AC or AO player would have
been pretty disappointed, imo.
