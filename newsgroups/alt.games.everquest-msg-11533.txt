My monk has fairly crappy equipment (no planes stuff, no nice toys from 
velious), and has just under 1k ac at 51. With that equipment, i.e. if I 
didn't retire him and if I did join the raids, I could have about 1100 
at 51. I've read reports from monks reaching 1300 by level 60 with 
equipment that was waaay out of my range
But the advantage of monks is that before 50 they can get much higher AC 
than SK/Paladins without uber equipment. So, a normal non-uber guild or 
non overly twinked warrior/paladin/SK before level 50 will generally 
have less AC than a monk equipped for same or less cash

Oh, I thought that's what you meant. When soloing, FD is very essential, 
of course

Past 50 it gets tougher. Velious quest armor is very nice for plate 
wearing tanks, so they catch up and pass the monks. However, not 
everyone will be able to get a full set. More so, most people won't make 
it past 50, and until then, monks have a choice to be a very good tank, 
if they wear decent equipment
