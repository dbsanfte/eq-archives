}Well, maybe it's just me, but I don't make a profit off my friends.  

That's one way of looking at it, of course.  The other way being that he 
took a 5-10K loss off what he could have sold it in the bazaar for, for 
his friend.

}If I find a spell for 300pp, and I know a friend of mine needs it, I'll 
}snap it up, and ask him to pay the 300pp I paid for it.

In principle, I'm with you on that.  Except that 20K is still more money 
than my character has ever had, or even all of my characters put together  
have ever had.  I think it's unreasonable to expect such a very lucky 
stroke of luck to be -given- away.  Especially if I have a friend who 
really wants the spell and can afford it and would happily pay me 20K for 
it, and see it as me giving him a 33% discount because he's a friend.

I'd really like to advance my character someday, and sad but true, you 
can't do that if you give everything away.  And sure enough, I have enough 
friends that pretty much anything I loot, ever, will be something that 
someone I know could use.  Oh dear, I looted some plat, Joethemonk 
needed some plat, I better go give it to him...

And I want a pony.  Not just any pony, I want the really damn fast one.  
I'll never ever ever loot one.  The only way I will ever get it is by 
making some plat.  And it would take approximately 1000 hours in Rathe 
Mountains, 40 solid days, so I don't think that's a very realistic 
approach.  I may have to sell a few things, and since more often than not, 
my customers will be decent folk of one sort or another, I can't just give 
everything to people just because I like them.  We can talk heavy 
discount, if you want, but at some point, I'd really like to make a few 
plat, thank you very much.

I have noticed, that when I'm in situations like the OP, even if I bother 
to give my friend the Uber Thingie I have luckily located, they frequently 
insist on paying me, or at least giving me something for it, and we end up 
having a reverse haggling session: "I couldn't possibly take more than X-Y 
from you for it" "Oh, come on, take X+Y!" So generally, we both end up 
very happy when we agree on X.  I've never been fortunate enough to have X 
be much above 1-2K, but I'd imagine it'd still be true at 20K.

}Even if, at 20k, they are saving 40k.  I also expect the same treatment 
}from my friends, and, generally speaking, I get it.

Your friends must be far richer than I.  I understand how that goes, I 
have some rich friends too.  So far, none of them have given me a pony.  
They have given me many nice things, and I've given them many nice things.  
And I value being able to give people nice things.  But ponies are no 
drop, so I'm not holding my breath.
