Not really.  As a Magician, I fight mostly the same way as a Wizard, and I
do quite well hunting for exp, solo or in a group.  (I'm just generally
messing around with quests or tradeskills, which mostly require that I kill
things half my level for parts.)  Besides, if you have a competant Wizard
around when you're in a dungeon, you're that much less likely to die in an
overpull/train, because he should be able to Evac/Portal everyone out.
