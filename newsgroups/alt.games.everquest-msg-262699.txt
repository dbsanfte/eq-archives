Your definition of "voting your conscience" is pretty twisted.  By
your definition, we're supposed to allow George W. Bush to be
re-elected, someone who is clearly severely damaging America.

Thanks, but no thanks.  I'm voting my conscience, and my conscience
tells me the absolutely highest priority is doing my part to help make
sure George W. Bush isn't re-elected.

Sadly, I have to accept the fact that he WILL be re-elected.  :(
