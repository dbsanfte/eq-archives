Yes, but I didn't know that is what it is called until months after
I started using it. And yes, if I grouped, I would know what it was
called months ago. But see my reasons for not grouping.

I do ask questions in game. But some, now kinda obviously, I should
be asking, I don't as I don't see there is a question to be asked.

I know there are multiple correct ways to handle combat, etc. But I
had to puzzle out the ones I use. I think it should be somewhere in
a faq, not necessarily in the faq for this newsgroup.
