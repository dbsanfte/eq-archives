>See it used a lot I dont have a bard - I assume its some form of lull?

Bards are only one class that is kite capable.  :)

Druids can 'Quad Kite' which consists of snaring 4 mobs, running in circles
until all 4 mobs are bunched together to look like just a single mob, then
hitting them with an AE nuke, running off a ways, AE nuke, run, nuke, etc until
all 4 mobs are dead.  4x's the xp for solo mob mana.

Bards 'Swarm Kite'.  I've never played a Bard, but as far as I can tell, their
damage song, unlike the Druid AE spell which can only hit a max of 4 mobs at
once, can damage a huge amount of enemies.  So the Bard can kite an entire zone
worth of mobs at once...  ;oP

Necros and Rangers 'Fear Kite', but differently.  Necros use their Snare/Dot to
pull and then cast fear on mob and send pet after it.  As long as they keep the
mob feared, pet takes no damage and Necro can either sit and relax between
castings, or use their lifetaps and other dots.  

Rangers fear kite works on animals.  Rangers Snare pull a critter, then fear it
and run behind it hacking it to bits.  Recast Fear when needed and continue to
hack at it's heels.

Wizards can kite also, but I have never played a Wizard nor have I seen a
wizard do this.  I'm going to guess it works very similar to Druid kiting...

Hope that helps and that I haven't been too off the mark on my explanations.
