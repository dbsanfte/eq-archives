Agree with Bizbee too...on Tunare, and i am sure other servers as well,
spelling and grammar are a thing of the past. And I am not talking about HK
players or ESOL players, but good ole american kids who are apparently dumb
as a box of hammers these days. When I pass thru LOIO and see "Ned mor at
sanaek forte plz snd telz" I cringe. But when I get to WW / DN / ToV and see
the same thing, it positively scares me.
