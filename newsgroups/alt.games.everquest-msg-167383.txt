Aegis of Life was one of the most insanely hard quests back in The Day and
the stats reflected that.

Mild!  That completely trashes the Aegis in virtually all aspects.  The 12
STA and 90 HPs will give you a huge HPs boost (try taking it off and
checking how far your max HPs drop) and the 90 mana and 8 Wis gives you
more mana than you had before to boot.  Win/win.
