Don't you just love those that try and play you for a mug? Favourites to
look for;

"I'll trade this "Piercer of Sensationalism" for your 2k Item. The PoS is
worth 4k you could easily sell it and be up 2k"

A: You sell it for 4k and pay me 2k for the item then you'll be up 2k.
(Never trade unless you KNOW the worth of an item or can actually use it,
chances are his item hasn't been worth that for months)

"I'll pay you 200pp for that 400pp item, it's not really any better than I
have already."

A: What you have already is not any concern of mine, price is 400pp

"That is way too expensive I'll give xxxpp for it."

A: If you can't afford it don't buy it.
This is a sure sign that someone wants the item, try doing a PC in the zone
to confirm (remember to / all and /guildstatus any suspicious PC's...chances
are the guild will match your prospective buyers)

"Will you take trades?"

A: No
(Of course this is down to you if you will take trades but rest assured, If
the trade was any good he/she would of offered the item straight up, be
ready for a list of junk if you say yes)

On the otherside, anyone that auctions as selling something "Cheap!" prolly
isn't, if it was cheap they'd have put up the price to get the quick sale
(only reason to sell cheap is to sell fast)
