Is there anything other than your Channelling skill and respective
school of magic skill (Alteration, Abjuration, etc.) that directly
affect whether or not your spell is interrupted? I was soloing the
giants in FM recently with my druid and I would snare and then
backpeddle during the recast delay. Once the spell gems came up again
I would stop (making it a point to come to a complete stop - even
waiting a second or second and a half after to be sure) and cast my
first DoT. I noticed that nearly half the time I would get a "your
casting was interrupted" message.

I did notice that during root/dotting, when I stood up to reapply the
DoT, the interruptions seemed much less frequent.

Like I said, I was sure that I was at a complete standstill when
attempting to cast on the pull. Sometimes it worked, sometimes not.
Any ideas?
