And then snack on everyone else on their way back to the pond.  That's
assuming, of course, that they don't just float around on land until they
die, which some of them have been known to do.  I hate the fish in the Lake
of Ill Omen, by the way.  They look like a fish, move like a fish, but
fight like dirty b*stards.  And every now and then some genius with
Levitate manages to drag a few of them out of the lake on their way through
the zone.
