Dont sit on the damn train tracks . Tower is a nice camp as is basement,
hand room , warlord room,right courtyard and perhaps even the left corner
just after the first 2 guards. All of these places can just watch trains go
by all day long. If you happen to be sitting at the zoneline your an idiot
and deserve to die multiple times. On the brightside you will generally have
a whole bunch of other idiots to comiserate with. In other words I accuse
you of being part of the problem.
