Point of fact, he was succeeding by harassing people. You and I know there
are no camps, not every noob does. The harassment part is same reason I
don't sit around the gate in West Freeport with a druid or shammy unless I
am up for it.

Maybe it is just me, I leave zones all the time when I get harassed by
beggers, snoopers, major idiots: I just don't want to be in their general
area. I am thinking of getting a third party program just to manage my
ignore lists.

Beggers do try and shame/force/pester people into giving them stuff like it
is their god given right to have it and your obligation to give it. It is
what makes them so irritating.
