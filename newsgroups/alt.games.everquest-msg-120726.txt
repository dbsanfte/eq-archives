Weird that you're replying on this branch of the thread re: a snip that
happened on another, but no matter.  When I did snip your tale of some
earlier guard exploit that Verant fixed, it was to put your quotation of
rule #11 closer to your assertion that I had ignored rule #11. My reply
was intended to point out that rule #11 was about bugs and therefore not
applicable.

At any rate, I do agree that the example you cited is your best argument
here, and I'm glad you gave it. Despite the fact that you swore earlier
that you would not give us any examples. If it really happened (and it was
before my time so I don't know) then it is a case of Verant addressing a
use of guards that they did not intend.  Let's think about that for a
second.  First of all, let me undo my earlier damage and requote your tale
here:

Let's stipulate that the above is fact.  Then:

1. Do you think that any of the players "exploiting" the guards had
disciplinary action taken against their accounts?  Or did Verant just
decide they didn't want this happening and change the code so it couldn't?

2. If Verant's intent was that guards were not supposed to give exp to the
exploiters who used this trick for 100% of their kills, is it a disaster
that honest players like yourself lose exp on the 2% of mobs that they
either can't handle or accidently run into a guard?  After all, you
haven't done ALL of the work to kill that mob -- not the Iron Man style
that I would expect from you, TwoHead.

One pet peave of mine, and I've seen it elsewhere in this endless thread,
is the killing of guards.  I started out in Paineel and lately there are a
ton of high level players in Paineel farming the guards.  This can be
particularly bad for newbies because they need a key to get out of
Paineel. You get the key from guards, and the Soulbinder is inside the
city walls. If the key giving guards are killed, and the newbie dies and
ends up back inside, he's stuck until they repop.

Now I don't like it when players kill the guards, but the way I see it, it
is part of the game.  Furthermore, I have seen a GM in Paineel resolving a
dispute between two players fighting over who gets to kill the guards.  He
never said guard killing is bad, and I maintain that since you *can* do
it, and the rules mention nothing about it, it is Verant's intent that it
be allowed.  If they decide to stop it they will do a code change.
Personally, I hope they do.

I don't think that the fact that key giving guards are killable qualifies
as a bug.  Nor do I think that the players who do so are scum-bag
exploiters.

Same thing with any of the potential exploits (again, read tactics) that
you warned us about at the start of this thread.  I don't believe that
players are going to be disciplined for them if they are not against the
rules.  It is a stretch to call them "bugs" and invoke rule #11.  And if
Verant decides they don't like them, they will either make a new rule, or,
more likely, change the code.

You are entitled to your opinions on how the game is to be played, and so
is everyone else (e.g. I'll never kill guards in Paineel).  What I
objected to was your implication that disciplinary action was likely to be
taken against the original poster if he experimented with guard tactics. I
did, and still do, think that is complete hogwash.

What I objected to further, as the thread wound on and on, was your
labeling of anyone who disagrees with you as a "rules lawyer" and your
seeming willingness to set yourself up as the grand pooba and judge of
all EQ tactics.  But those are really side issues.
