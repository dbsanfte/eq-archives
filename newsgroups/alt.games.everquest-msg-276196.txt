That's because not everyone has these problems. Some servers seem to be
extremely fragile, while others are fine. My server (Perenolde) has no queues
and is very stable, aside from some lag spikes and the usual high latency in
Ironforge (where the Alliance auction house is located). However, there are a
group of servers that seem to have far more than their fair share of problems.

Everyone was willing to give Blizzard some time to sort out their birthing
problems but that grace period has just about expired. A lot of people are
getting fed up, and justifiably so.
