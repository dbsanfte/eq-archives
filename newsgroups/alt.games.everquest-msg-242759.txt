OK, trying to edit down the beastlord one:



Beastlord. Traditional duty: melee damage output. Other roles: a variety of
other things, depending on situation and group lineup. Excellent solo class.
A beastlord is a good DPS class, and gets enough HP to be a
good "off-tank." Not a reliable primary tank (no heavy armor), but in
a pinch can step in. A beastlord gets some heals, a fair assortment of
shaman-type buffs, and with some skill can use his pet for crowd control
(because the pet does taunt). Later in life the beastlord gets slow and
haste spells, and a highly-prized line of group mana/HP regeneration buffs
popularly referred to as "kittycrack." A beast even gets some DoTs and
weak nukes. LDoN adventuring has been a boon for beastlords:
a single class that can melee, DoT, slow, haste, help heal in a bad spot,
offtank, even help a bit with crowd control, is _very_ useful for LDoN.
Raid groups tend not to value beastlords as much, a large raid group
will always have specialists who are better at the various functions.
   Most beastlords solo their way through much of the first 50 levels, which
they can do faster than almost any other class. To develop the full
range of skills, mix up how you spend that solo time: do plenty
of brute-force soloing (where you and the pet are both meleeing
the mob directly) and _also_ spend quality time playing pet-cleric
(safer, slower soloing where you mostly let the pet do the work and
stay back healing the pet and DoTing/nuking the mob).
