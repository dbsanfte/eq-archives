If you mean they could buy themselves a 2nd box character that would enable
them to play more and not have to wait groups, then sure that 55th+ Cleric,
Druid, Shaman, Enchanter would make a difference and not cause anyone else
any problems and  a similar situation has kept me playing (although I payed
no cash for my alts and have had to get them to their current level, just
not from 1st)

$30 will buy you a  2 - 3k item. I can make that in a week of playing,
although $30 is hardly a lot of cash (about ï¿½20, I spend that much just
buying food and drink when visiting friends for a night in) but it also
wouldn't do much for me in game to make it worth spending. If you have money
to burn then you can make your EQ life much easier buying plat and high end
items but $30 isn't going to change a whole lot.

I can't argue that one, a lot of the worthwhile quests include really
tedious time sinks (a lot of the none worthwhile ones do, also) I suggest
playing in your spare time and not when you are meant to be making money.

HG's don't offer enough cash to make that worthwhile at that level. If 65th
(even mid 50's) Druids are farming HG's they are either stupid or "Ebayed"
themselves and don't have clue where real cash can be made at that level.

There is a Cancel Account option that will allow you some respite from your
metaphorical anal trauma.
On the other hand, if you like getting Barrymored, then hop over to the PA
website and grab yourself another account for a couple of hundred dollars.
