A group of Altera Vita guildmates and myself just completed a 21.5 hour 
exp grind to ding us all level 70. So i thought i'd post and share some 
data with everyone that's interested in what they can expect. 

First, the entire grind was done in PoFire in teh second castle. All 
mobs were level 68. The exact time of the grind took 21:38:40 (rounded 
to the nearest :05). We killed 1255 mobs. That averages to 0.3195% reg 
exp/mob and 0.30877%exp/minute. 

here's teh breakdown in # of mobs it took to ding each level. 

67 - 261 
68 - 291 
69 - 332 
70 - 371 

Additionally, AA exp on these mobs at lvl 70 was right at 4%/mob as 
compared to 5%/mob at 65. 

I hope this information proves useful and informative to those heading 
out this week to grind it out.

Let's double check the High Con Bonus Formula:

Formula says it's 1.95+((mob_level-(player_level-5))*.13)

For level 65's hunting 68's that's:
1.95+(.13*8) = 2.99
For Level 70's hunting 68's that's:
1.95+(.13*3) = 2.34

2.34/2.99 = .78

Our expected value is .04/.05 = .8

Well within the accuracy of the % EXP display
