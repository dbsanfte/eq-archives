Yep, you have defined my bitch completely I want them shared with all
camps without having to get a certain amount at that camp to use
them...   i.e. lower guk and ruj hills I have no points at all, and on
my server, its like pulling teeth to get someone to go there..... 
oh and to add, I wish I could use my point not only at any camp, but
be able to buy spells and pass em along to my other characters.  My
necro will never get the points for his spells.. I made him for solo
only... and well its just a personal gripe.
I understand the no drop on gear (well only sorta) but spells should
NEVER be no drop in my minds eye.
