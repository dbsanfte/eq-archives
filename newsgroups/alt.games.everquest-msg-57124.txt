I have a very strange problem with my everquest connection.  Randomly, I
will be playing, get screen lock and then I reboot.  On certain time when I
begin to run the patch its give me an error 7000ct, and say dns host lookup
failed.  Additionally, I can still use the internet but CANNOT go to
everquest.com or it seems any sony related sites.  I can visit sony. com,
but when I got to online games I get the cannot get dns #.  I live in
Evansville, IN and when I called sigecom customer service they said they had
other complaints as well.  I have also tried to close firewall still has the
same result. any ideas or suggestions?

Thanks
