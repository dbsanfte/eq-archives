No, it isn't contradictory at all.  Always answer the question, but let 
them digest the first bit before you give them the second bit.  Yes, they 
may be a few hours or days older then, but that -hardly- counts as 'wait 
til you're older'.

No, new question, first hand.  Lesa has said that if a child is able to 
pose the question, a reasonably competent parent -should- be able to 
compose an answer they can understand, -without- telling them to wait 
until they are older.

Only for you, mate. :)

Funny, they already have muppets of at least 4 non-caucasian races that I 
can think of...  Pretty sure there are disabled muppets... Elmo might 
count as an extremely annoying muppet... Do you really think this is their 
-first- attempt at teaching tolerance?

Good thing they already covered that one, then.
