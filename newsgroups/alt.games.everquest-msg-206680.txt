Brewing is second to JC only in ease to get to GM level.  You can sit in 
one spot in a couple different zones at least, and raise brewing up to 
248.  You might have to move slightly to reach the right vendor.  It's 
also cheap.  Not sure what you need to do after 248, but, 242 + geerlock 
will get you maxxed for purposes of making the GM trohpy anyway.
