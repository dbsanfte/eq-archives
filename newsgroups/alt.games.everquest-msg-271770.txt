   Um, you know that the FAQ isn't exactly spam, right?  That it was
created and is posted monthly at the collective request of the AGE
newsgroup community?

   I can understand that you might not want to see it, but public plonkings
are usually reserved for people who are doing something obnoxious, rather
than those performing a public service.  Of course, it is your prerogative
to be as obnoxious your own self as you would like, I suppose.
