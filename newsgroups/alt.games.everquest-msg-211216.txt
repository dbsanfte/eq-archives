Well, no, I solo dark blue mobs all the time.  When I group, I usually 
kill dark blue mobs too now, but, a few levels back, it was mostly 
yellows and reds.  You know, the "What would you like it to say on your 
tombstone?" type of mobs.

For newbies, the con is actually pretty accurate.  At low levels, with a 
few exceptions, the con system works fairly well.  Heck, at low levels 
you have a pretty decent chance at soloing yellows and reds depending on 
what class you are.  I used to solo yellows well into my 30s as an 
untwinked shaman.

I do not ignore the con messages at all, when I solo, I never attempt 
anything that is not dark blue or lower anymore.  There are some mobs out 
there that are very serious undercons, but, for the most part, the con 
system works pretty well for helping me decide whether or not to attack 
something.
