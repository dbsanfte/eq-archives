Lair,

I had fun playing with a guard in Netherbains lair.  I was looking round the
zone, and got a train from the tunnel, It wasn't gonna kill me but I was on
my way to the nexus to log, as i ran to the zone I saw a guard, and FD'd my
mobs on him.  Hehe me and a few people who zoned in watched royal rumble.. 1
guard versus 7 or so mobs, he had a valient attempt (killed some) but alas
he died :)
