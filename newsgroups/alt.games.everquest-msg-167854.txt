My kids and I are thinking of starting playing EQ again (we stopped about 4
months ago because of the grind it turned into).  I know all of this would
be subjective and based on what we like, but I thought it might be a fun
discussion topic also.

I've seen lots of posts about two player teams, but what about an
interesting four player team.  There is the obvious:

Warrior - Cleric - Chanter - Druid - Get tank, healing, rez, brain buff,
slow, haste, porting and snare (amoung others).  Drawback - doesn't kill
mobs too fast.  No feign for pulling at high levels.

SK - Pally - Chanter - Druid - Two tank types, some healing, rez eventually,
brain buff, slow haste, porting and snare.  Two tanks means faster killing.
Plus we have FD for pulling.  No true tank for uber encounters although I
doubt we'll be doing that with four anyway.  Clarity would help the whole
team.

Pally - Beastlord - chanter - druid - Beastlords would high damage output,
plus some nice mana regen / health regen that stack with chanters.  Lose FD
ability.

Necro - Necro - Necro - Shammy - Lots of pets, self mana regen on all
classes, haste slow, no porting.  Not a lot of variety for switching off.
Plus at level 59 and a billion AA's looks like the chanter gets the best pet
with dire charm.

Thanks in advance

Mike
