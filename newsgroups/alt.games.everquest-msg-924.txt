And still that would be the wrong response.  Now...if the druid does not
know how to play a bard it would be an appropriate answer.  But...just
because a player doesn't know how to play their current class it doesn't
mean that they are incapable of telling the bard how to play better.  This
implies that if you suck in one class you will automatically suck in ALL
classes.  Hardly the case.
