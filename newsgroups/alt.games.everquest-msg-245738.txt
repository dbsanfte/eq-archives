Don't think I can be pressing the buttons wrong. When I first got the
n45 I used it with the amiga emulator (winuoa or something) to remap the
keys for Dungeon Master to the N45 so I could play the game similar to
the usual wasd setup I have become used to rather than have to move the
keyboard or cross my arm over to the numpad to move. After an hour or so
of play the tendons on the back of my hand were already sore, while I
can play EQ using the wasd keys on my old IBM PS/2 keyboard for
literally hours with no pain at all. I already have mild rsi in my right
wrist so I notice it fairly quick when something is putting strain on my
tendons.

I notice the buttons seem to have a longer travel and require constant
pressure to move down compared to the buttons on my keyboard, which have
an initial resistance then move down fairly easily with a fairly short
travel time.  Maybe if you have larger hands it's less appearant, as
mine are on the smallish side for an adult male.
