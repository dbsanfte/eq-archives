I don't get it. Its Verant's bad design. Their fault for making
it the number one most wanted item in the game. And then its
their fault for creating the bottle neck. The whole thing is stupid.

I applaud the people that did this. More power to them.

The whole line of 'but its an epic weapon! It should be rare
and special!' is bullshit. Its an item like any other in the game.
If I do the work to get them item, kill the mobs, do the quests
and complete it I should be able to get it. Not wait in line for it,
or battle with 6 other guilds and clerics that want theirs.
Hell I don't wait in line in real life I am not going to do it in a
fucking game.
