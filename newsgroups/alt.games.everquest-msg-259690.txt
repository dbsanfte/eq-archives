Yeah, I failed to mention that :)  

75 for the grey vs.  119 for PoP IIRC.

I'm bored, so:

55*55*75*1.2 / 2 = 136,125 XP
(a sun rev for a 61 pally in a duo - if the druid is 61 as well)

62*62*119*2.16*2.73 / 6 = 449,568 XP
(a lumbering beast for a 61 pally in a group of 6 61's)

64*64*119*2.16*3.12 / 6 = 547,474 XP
(a razorfiend suppressor for a 61 in a group of 6 61's)

For some reason, the mobs in PoV BC seemed easier to kill than
BoT mobs, and they average higher levels.  (you have the
elementals at 60 and lessers at 46 dropping your average
XP per kill there.  In BC you have the higher level fiends
raising it)

My BL at 65 tanked those pretty well (CA3/LR3 at the time
I was doing it - 1250 buffed AC, 6300 group buffed HP).

Also, the pull distance is fairly short (unless you have to
start pulling from FC)
