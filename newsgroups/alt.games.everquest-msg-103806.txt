One other suggestion if you have Luclin. I know that HQ Bear pelts are used
for making 10 slot 10% weight reduction bags. There are other pelts that can
be used to make these bags -> HQ Rockhopper Pelts <-. For me anyways, they
drop more often because I can quad rockhoppers and get them faster than I do
bears.

For some reason, people are still selling HQ Bear pelt for 30pp each on
Rathe anyways, but I have over 3 stacks of HQ Rockhopper Pelts. Go figure.
