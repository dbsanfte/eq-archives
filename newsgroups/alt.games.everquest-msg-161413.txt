I started a Wood Elf bard on Rallos Zek a few days ago out of sheer
morbid curiosity. Suffice to say, he's now level 9, sporting a few
pieces of the newbie quest armor and leather to fill in the gaps.

So far I'm having a blast! I haven't participated in the PvP aspect
too much yet, aside from fighting back against the suprisingly few and
far between seemingly random attemts at my life. I've been attacked
three times, but only died once. After my first group on RZ disbanded
for the night, I challenged our dwarven rogue to a duel (we were both
level 4 hunting in a 6 person group on orc hill, so we couldn't simply
start beating on each other yet) At first we were pretty even, until
an orc centurion took offence to our friendly sparring within view of
his tent.

/ooc and /shout are a lot more civil than I would have expected. At
first I was afraid of asking any potentially newbie questions about
PvP and getting jumped for it. Because of that, at first, I learned
most answers from simple observation, like being "immune" before level
5, looting items, and such. As time went on however, I found myself
participating more and more in /ooc and /shout by asking/answering
questions, offering advice, and chatting, than I ever did on a non-pvp
server.

And now we come to the heart of this post. I do still have some
questions about the general PvP experience that I've been thinking
about while sitting in an almost comatose state at work on a Sunday
afternoon.

I did a search in Google within A.G.E for PvP, Rallos Zek, and other
things to get a general idea about things before I posted to make sure
I don't post things that have already been said. Unfortunately, many
of the posts I waded through are pretty dated (around 1999). I still
read through those, but kept in mind that many things have probobly
changed since that time.

1. About looting a player's corpse. What exactly can another person
loot from you? Stuff you have equipped, or stuff in your inventory, or
both? Money? What about containers in your inventory? Can someone open
those and take stuff from inside?

2. One of the things I read about were faction hits for killing other
players. How exactly does this work? Is there a way to work up the
faction that goes down, by killing players of other races, or the
traditional monsers?

3. I think I remember reading in a patch message a couple of months
back saying there were some big PvP changes made. Unfortunatly I
didn't pay too much attention to it because I was never an active
dueler with any of my characters. After a quick search, I see that
things such as fear and charm will not work on another PC. Also that
DD spells are reduced in effectiveness if cast on a PC. Are these
still in effect on RZ? If they are, I may have to rethink my bard
choice. I was really looking forward to charming someone and sending
them against a wandering MOB =) I love bards, but if I'm not going to
be able to defend myself, I'm not going to be having a very good
time... Which leads me into...

4. I've also read that well played bards are feared in PvP combat.
After paying special attention to this set of information, I find that
many of the tactics use *suprise* fear and charm. Of course Selos and
Chants were mentioned also. After the supposed changes, are bards
still a force to be reckoned with in PvP? I know we have other songs
at our disposal, but /sigh charm would just be so much fun!

All in all, I'm enjoying the environment on RZ. Of course this is
simply a first impression of a few nights spent in Greater Faydark and
Butcherblock Mountains. I refuse to participate in random PK'ing, as
all it serves to do in my eyes is to ruin someone elses playing time.
But I do like having the option of dealing with beggars/nitwits/train
makers by hitting them a few times with a group of friends. It sure
beats calling them names over /shout  =) I cannot count the number of
times I would play on my regular server, see some nitwit spamming the
zone with auctions, random dribble, etc, and just thinking "Boy what I
wouldn't give to take a swing at Soandso..."
