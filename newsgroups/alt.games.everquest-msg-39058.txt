Not necessarily.  He (she?) might have been having a conversation
with Fugel on a non-Usenet forum (there are a ton of them devoted
to EQ, I participate in several myself), when a moderator or some
other person flushed the thread, so "News" came here to ask
Fugel for his/her email address knowing that Fugel reads
this forum as well.

Always examine your assumptions before flaming.
