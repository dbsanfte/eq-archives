If you don't mind the tedium, you can kill the green goblins in BBM
for the heads and blood. They sell for 4 pp 4gp and some change to the
vendors. They only drop off the goblin warriors and goblins in the
zone. The warriors are off the x-roads. (welps, enraged, crazed,
etc... do not have these items usually) They are easy to kill and if
you get your round going between the 2-3 camps on that side you can
make about 100pp a hour (Granted if no newbees camping for exp, still
try to share with ones that need the exp and probably the pp to). It's
not bad. I use it to get spell money time to time when I'm just in a
chating mood. The goblins are weak as sin. Killable by a level 10, at
level 34 you can just wait for the pops and rips through them like
tissue paper, the cycles are bout 5 minutes though. They are about as
good as the aqua goblins were before they nerfed them. There are many
ways to make pp, I personally like the looting of pp like the hg's and
such because I like cash in hand, much like here since you are selling
to vendors for straight up pp.
