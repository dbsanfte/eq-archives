I tried smoking for a while thought it was stupid, and stopped.  Most 
people find it physically too addictive to do this.  Maybe some people 
just don't get addicted for some reason, genetics perhaps.  My wife 
smokes about a pack a day, and has quit in the past, but, it's very 
difficult for her to quit. The cravings never went away for her, not even 
after 14 months of no cigarettes.
