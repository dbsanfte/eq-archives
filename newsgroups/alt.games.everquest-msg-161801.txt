OK, I misunderstood there.  We have never tried the rest of it with one
group, but, I could believe it's doable, although the break in can be a
bitch, just depends on what you get there I suppose.  The 62 ranger does
actually have some very nice equipment, as he was in a high end guild for a
while, and even the discards there are better than just about anything that
my guild is capable of getting.
