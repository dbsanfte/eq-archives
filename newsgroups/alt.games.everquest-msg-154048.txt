What's to tune?  Just give the Monk a disc that for (Level - 40)
seconds makes it so that they have no "back":  Block/Dodge/etc all
work, no enhanced chance to stun for hitting from behind, no
backstab (any other "from behind" effects I'm forgetting here?).
Put it on a short timer (6 minutes maybe?).  <All> of the DnD-
variant "Monk" classes are based on Kung Fu / Bruce Lee / Jackie
Chan / SixtyBazillionOtherMovies, so give them a cinematic-type
ability they can use to pull, or run away, or just bounce between
targets in combat if that's what they want.
