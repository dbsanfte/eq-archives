Agree on juggs/reets.. my guild took 3 groups down for a juggs raid and we
had 30+ spells drop. Quite a few were needed by the casters in attendance,
and the rest went to other guild members or in the bank. The last pull was a
reet wizard who dropped a cobalt helm!  Great night all around!  Of course,
I spent most of my time feigned on the ground. /sigh
