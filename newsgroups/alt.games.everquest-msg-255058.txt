Dunno why you think an assholish ignorant smartass remark like that is made
ok with a smiley. :P   Regardless, refer to previous statement. Read the
FAQ, edit the INI. You'll notice a BackgroundMaxFPS there, which is I think
set to 30 or 40 by default. Set it to 10 or lower will make CPU usage go
down a bit, as per discussed functionality.
