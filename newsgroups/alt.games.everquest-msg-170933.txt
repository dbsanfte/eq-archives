Greetings, all!

I was just looking for some input on what would be some good equipment
for my 34 druid.  I'm attaching my Magelo profile so you can see what
I have.  Any suggestions would be appreciated!

I've been trying to focus on WIS, and have done ok so far (I think). 
I know I need a better range item... :)

Much thanks!
