I'll consider that maybe I've missed something here. Which one of the 
following do you feel should not necessarily exist in a good guild?

1. Comraderie (sp?)
2. Loyalty
3. Commitment

Those were my claims, and I stand by them. I will concede that missing the 
third one doesn't make for a bad guild, necessarily, but surely not as good 
as one that has all three.
