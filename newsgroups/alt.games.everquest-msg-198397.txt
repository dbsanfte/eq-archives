    On production servers there's tons of people who are Ally to Chardok who
can run around cherry-picking nameds and mobs carrying big gold shields.
Excepting the really rare pieces that are also of high quality, prices on
Chardok stuff have crashed hard.

    /shrug - they may be testing what the average person is wearing, as
opposed to what they SHOULD be wearing. Hard to tell. What level does
Ghoulsbane start proccing, anyways? Oh, and could you possibly post what the
starting kits are for the PALs and ENCs?
