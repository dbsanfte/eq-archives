And damage shields.  And bandages.  And food.  And 
water...

And necros  - what's the thing they do that needs 
coffins?  (Sorry, I'm not at the level where I'm even 
needing that yet, so I keep forgetting)  I bet they get 
*that* a lot.

Try an Iksar monk.  I loved that.

Special bonus: no having to re-mem spells when you die.  
Just get up and start fighting again.
