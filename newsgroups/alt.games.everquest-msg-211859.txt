Don't Nathyn's guards and wolves also raise faction with the vamps in
Tenebrous?  Nathyn's is nice and, even though the guards and wolves are
mostly light blue at 60, 60 goes by so much faster than 59 you can still use
them to get through 60 if with just a little patience.  I read that the xp
used to be really great but was ratcheted down awhile ago.  IIRC, you can
pull singles at 56 as long as you're not KoS.  Once you become KoS, you need
to be 57 or you'll get adds.  You can pull the two inside guards without
actually going into the building, which is recommended.  If you walk around
the side of Nathyn's building, you'll see a couple of windows with a woman
each in them.  If you actually go into Nathyn's building to pull the
legionnaires, you may end up pulling the women along with the guards.
