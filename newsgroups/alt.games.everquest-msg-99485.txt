You are kind of missing the point though; for the last three years EQ
has not had competition which offered a faster, easier introduction to
the game. Now it does.

It gets more and more difficult to blame "game balance, the vision,
etc" for the reason why things have to be harder in the face of new
games which accelerate play. It will become even more difficult when
verant's  OWN GAME, Star Wars Galaxies, has things such as dying and
appering with all your equipment THROUGHOUT the game (as well as save
places, basically a lot like Anarchy Online) The only thing you might
have on a corpse are recently gained things you may want to go and
get.

I totally disagree. For one thing at level 5 and under its NOT just an
issue of having to retrieve your corpse, but rather the fact it only
lasts about half an hour. These changes are NOT about balance, they
are NOT so much about making things easier even. These changes are
MOSTLY about ONE THING and one thing only:

Like the Evac at lower levels and the corpse summon at lower levels,
these changes are TO GET PEOPLE OUT THERE. The old way of playing was
to remain glued to the newb area like a baby sucking on a teat until
you got level 6 so your corpse would last. Then you'd venture into the
zone just outside the newb area until higher.


>My money says that breaks
>more people than corpse runs would have.

Corpse runs will be much easier and more relaxed at level 11 than they
are at level 6 or below. By level 11 many classes come into more power
which helps them accelerate corpse runs. Several classes have invis by
that time, shaman's have sow at 9, etc.

During  the beta of anarchy online, my doctor martial artist character
explored a large part of the world running around and marvelling at
the sights and sounds and different music of different areas. I saw
exotic locales and strange terrifying beasts which were far beyond my
power to stand against. The longest period of exploration I had from
omni city was about two and a half hours, moving in a straight line.
Finally I was killed by something fast, huge and terrifying which made
me potty myself. The reason why I felt I could get out and explore
like that, though I was low level, was that you pop back up at your
save point with your inventory gear in a save chamber thing (and the
gear you can wear still on you)

That kind of game design gets people out into the world earlier. Its
not just about making it "easier." In EQ a character WILL be prepared
for 11 because he will have explored his home area more and be
familiar with it, he will take chances. At 11 he will adjust and be a
stronger character type to overcome the challenge and even on a new
server he will have plenty of other characters with the tools to help
him if there is some problem (even a 4 level druid can be of great
help to another character type without invis)
