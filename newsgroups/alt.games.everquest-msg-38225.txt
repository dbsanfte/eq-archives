hehe.  Thanks all.  I don't really mind the dood speak (although the doods
themselves would probably annoy me), I just wish it was phonetically
correct.  sux for sucks makes sense. rox for rocks makes sense.  roxxors
spells roxxors to me.  Ah well, in all fairness and so that they're brains
don't melt, I'll try to keep the "groovy" and "neat" comments to a minimum.
hehe
