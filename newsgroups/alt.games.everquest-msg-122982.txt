Ahh - thanks for the info, I didn't know that about disappearing on my own
screen regardless of success or failure. So, the little Ranger may or may
not have hidden, which would have disappeared as soon as I moved anyway.
Then he simply <sneaked> past all the gnolls?

Heh - that must have been my luckiest day in EQ so far, and it's true
ignorance is bliss, I wasn't the slightest bit worried at the time ; )
