Right. SOE doesn't answer questions about what spells do or how they 
work. 

Ironically, their response to ask other players was EXACTLY the RIGHT 
one. They have never been forthcoming about questions about the 
mechanics, that's -always- been the case.

Find out for yourself, and/or talk to other players. (in game, or via 
boards etc...)
