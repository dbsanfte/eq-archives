No, you haven't got it quite right.  Skills go up with use, until you
hit the cap for your level.  The cap goes up when you ding, until you
hit the maximum cap.

You can use training points to raise some skills up to the cap, and
you'll have to pay for the privilege once a skill is above a certain
number (not sure what that is though).  Some skills cannot be trained
(eg offense and defense), and you can only use training points to
raise tradeskills up to a certain level (again, not sure what that is
but it's fairly low, about 30 I think).
