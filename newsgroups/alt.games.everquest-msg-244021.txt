Gave up on DSP after getting rooted and killed by a pack of Tribals.
I took the advice of a fellow EQ'er and went to EW to try this on
Walruses.  Having a little more success and can get 1 or 2 mobs killed
but after those first couple others in the pack agro on me and won't
attack my pet anymore...   Any advice?
