768MB seems to work fine with all new character models.  I have all the new
features enabled, runs fine for the most part.  Every once in  a while the
game pauses, to load a texture into the video card I assume, having heard
this is the case somewhere in here some time back.  I had experienced this
before SoL, but rarely, it seems to happen a lot more now.
