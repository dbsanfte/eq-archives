Casters realm did a long forum post where chanters posted what grieved them
about the epic and suggestions of changes to stop bottlenecks, like Ragefire
was changed by Verant.

Most of the complaints focused on the Verina and Shissir bottlenecks and
camps.

I have noticed on Xegony that the biggest bottleneck is the Essence of
Vampire from Plane of Hate. A guild has been in PoH all this week and
cleared the plane each time it popped and after 5 days (repops on 8 hours =
15 clearings of Revenants) still had no drop.

This is the only piece I need.

How does other servers fare? Is the vampire essence just as rare?
