Well, from the post Ann seems largely clueless of the pull a game like
that can have. She seems to be equating it to normal life things a
wife might do for "escape" like knit and crap rather than for the
giant rock of crack that it is. Mmorpgs like this are very REAL
addictions that upset and destroy lives, marriages, families and work.
To think of them as anything else is potentially dangerous. 

After EQ I always have this in the back of my mind when starting a new
one and carefully regulate how much time I spend in it. Of course so
far after EQ no other one has had such an addicitve effect. 

That is kind of the best advertisement for AO, "Anarchy Online, you
play it about once a week and that is enough, SAVE YOUR MARRIAGE!!!"
