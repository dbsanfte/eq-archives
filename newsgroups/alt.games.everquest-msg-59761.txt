Sorry, but thus far in my admittedly limited necro career of seventeen
levels, I've had it happen in: E. Commons, W. Commons, Oasis of Marr,
and Ocean of Tears. Damn near every zone I've stopped to cast a pet in
for any period of time. Yesterday morning I was trying to finish up the
current xp bubble before hitting town to unload (I'm ashamed to say I
was in oasis. I need at least one more level to try the gargs in OoT
again. Those are some tough bastards.) and I attacked some deepwater.
The fight went well, and the last /pet report health I got was well over
50% and I was over half mana. I looted the croc, ran down to the water
and hit /pet guard me.
....
Nothing.
/pet guard here
....
Nothing.
/pet report health
....
Nothing. 
Look around.
No pet.
I wasn't getting the "You don't have a pet to command" message, so the
little bastard was out there someplace having a grand old time. I ran
all over that part of the zone, but no luck. I finally said "fuck Gabn"
and zoned out to go back to town.
