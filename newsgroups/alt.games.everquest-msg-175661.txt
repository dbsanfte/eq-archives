I love exploring large environments, but im concerned with this game
being TOO big. Anyone remember Daggerfall? Gigantic world. You could
wander anywhere you wanted to. Problem was, there was no point to it.
A huge world to explore is meaningless if its all empty or all
virtually the same. If SWG has a good mix of static locations and
randomly generated ones, then theres a new hope (pun intended). I
really hope that all cities are unique and detailed. When playing
Earth & Beyond - i was instantly dissapointed that no matter what
starbase i went to, it was exactly the same as the one i just left
behind. It made exploring pointless. Why go from point A to point B if
point B is exactly the same as point A?
