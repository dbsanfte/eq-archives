Ok, question....
Nevermind the verant rules....
What are the 'generally accepted' (as in what actually happens), when there
is a contested camp.
Me, be it if I am at the camp, and someone else comes along.....or visa
versa.....I try to share/offer to share.
That has seemed to work fine....till lately....I am at 40, and well, people
seem to be pretty militant on the camps, especially if there is good loot
involved.
Case for example.....Geonoids in CC.   There are 8 of them.  When I have had
a group, and someone else came along, I either have them join our group, or
just split the geos (there are 8 spawns).   Last night, a group moved
in....we offered to share the spawns.  There offer was....we either move, or
they pull over us.  Their reasoning was....they were higher level, and
deserved it more.
I have also run in to that attitude at the Great Oowomp.....other places as
of late as well.
I think what just irks me, is the pissy attitudes as of late with camping.
