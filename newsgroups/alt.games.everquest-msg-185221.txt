Clerics Symbold Line including Aego+

to
Blessing of Aegolism uses 4 dots.

difficult to
get however.
Group Symbol uses a single dot, I believe.
Turns out Naltron's Mark uses one dot, Marzin's Mark uses three dots,
Kazad's mark uses two dots. Hand of Virtue also uses two dots.
Death Pact, level 51 IIRC, uses a pearl. Divine Intervention, the
level

high end.
