When you are fighting mountain giants in the fort in FM, you often find yourself
pulling giants out of the fort and around the corner up onto the hillside to
your group. If you are sow'd and turn the corner well ahead of the giant, he
will angle and turn into the wall trying to chase you. After a few seconds of
unsuccessfully trying to bash through the wall in his persuit of you, he will
"warp" and appear right where you are standing.  AFAIK, it's just another little
"trick" that was coded into the game to stop people from abusing the geography
to fool stupid AI mobs.
