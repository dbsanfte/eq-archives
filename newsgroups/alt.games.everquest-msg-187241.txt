My apologies. :(  I have fairly good "mental garbage filters" when
scanning headers (though I sometimes miss juicy stuff), so I haven't
really noticed the individual in question.  (Or else I'm just
clueless...wouldn't be the first time.) All I could think about were the
handful of other boards/groups I frequent where they cry bloody murder if
you go Off Topic...*sigh*...hence why I enjoy this place.

And hiya Moodel. :) I've been watching you here...and been glad to see you
too!  Makes the world seem a little smaller.  I miss EQ a bit, but not as
much as I enjoy getting my life back and being in shape again.  I'm trying
to build up enough of a "I have a life" buffer so that it won't go away
when I try out EQ2. :T
