Right, its all gold, and most of it is lame... stats you won't care about,
AC hardly higher than FS plate.  The boots are acceptable because you
can easily get them at a very low level, and because its really quite
difficult to come up with anything better for a long time.  The bracers
are what cleric quest armor -should- be... WIS and AC both higher
than anything you'll get up into your high 40s, like as not.  We refer to
it as cleric gold because there isn't a single name for the pieces,
its Vambraces of the this, Bracers of the that, Boots of the something
else.  Some clerics wear a full suit of it as a badge of honor, or as
a style choice... a high elf can get to 200 wis by judicious use of non-
visible armor pieces and jewelry.

Bracers of the Reverant is correct: AC 9 wis 5, non lore so you
can wear a pair... but the quest parts -are- lore, so you'll have
to get a friend to carry the second set, or do the whole thing
complete with running around, twice.

PS Purple is the plane of Hate drop armor, and the reason so many
high level clerics are called "Grapes"... you won't find any of
it listed as "purple" either
