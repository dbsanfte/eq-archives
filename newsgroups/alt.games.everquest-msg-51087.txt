WAAAAAAH.

Platinum is an imaginary currency, used for the sole purpose of furthering 
your position in the game. Your sword, OTOH, has a specific worth. This 
worth is not measured in plat, it is measured in ATK, delay, bonuses, 
procs, and overall bad-assed-ness.

If you think it has any other value, then well done on letting us all know 
how pathetic you are.
