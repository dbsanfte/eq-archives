Finally broke down and bought SWG and played it. After about a two hour
download (I hate dialup), I spent another 20 minutes signing up and another
36 minutes on the tutorial. I took an artisan and got killed within about 10
minutes. Came back and did some surveying. It wasn't really exciting, but I
did get a handle on how to do it. Went up one skill level. When I came back
to sell my samples, it hit me how different this game will be. You set the
price for your goods. Who knows what a fair price will be? I have no idea if
I gave them away or got good money. Logged out after that so I could do a
little research.

The game itself has a lot of potential. I'm sure after I figure out wgat I'm
doing I will play it a lot. The one thing that was really frustrating was
moving around in the city. Very sticky. There were several times I had to
stop just to let my computer catch up. I'm not sure if this is due to the
dialup connection or not enough RAM. I went into my options page and took a
lot of the detail out. It helped a little. I figured my 128 mg graphics card
could handle anything. I have this problem occasionally on EQ, but only very
briefly.

Otherwise it's pretty cool. Interesting landscapes and architecture. Every
once in a while they throw in some nice background music which does give you
a movie "feel". I probably won't hit it as hard as EQ for a while, but I do
think it has a lot more long run potential.
