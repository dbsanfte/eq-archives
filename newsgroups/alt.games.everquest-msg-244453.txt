I know your pain.  There is no reason why monks should suffer mitigation
penalties versus the other pure melees.  We do not want any special
treatment, we just want to be on a level playing field and not buried in
some poorly implemented nerf that was initiated because the tippy tops of
the class were a wee bit too good.  Someone said monks are the leather
wearers so it is justified.  If that is the case then bump up a monk's
ability to avoid being hit.  Have an avoidance ability that is independent
of AC and is affected by weight.  The more a monk is underweight the more he
will dodge attacks.  I have also heard the idea about maybe monks will get
the ability to be immune to mobs rampages.  Or immune to mobs riposting
them.  Both of these would add value to the class without marginalizing the
other melees.  As stated earlier, monks cannot generate agro to be main
tanks but they should be able to off tank for awhile incase the main tank
goes down.

I guess my big question is can someone explain AC in EverQuest terms?  If a
Warrior or Knight has 1800AC then why does it not help a monk to have 1800
AC?   Is AC some mysterious concept floating above San Diego that developers
look up to ever so often like looking into a crystal ball and trying to
guess what it means?

For those monks reading this that have not visited the official Everquest
forums at eqlive.com I encourage you to go there.  The monk class forum is
one of the most posted to forum of any class there and has very well written
posts about the problems with the class as it stands now.
