You could spend the next 30 levels in Velious.  :)  Start with cougars
in Iceclad (you can root/dot or fear kite them) and work up from
there.  Iceclad, Eastern Wastes and Great Divide will take you through
the mid-40s at least.

Be careful porting into Iceclad as there are KOS mid-30s mobs that
path through the portal.

As for Kunark, Frontier Mountains is good at your level but may be a
bit overcamped, depending on your server.  For high 30s I liked
Trakanon's Teeth, very quiet zone, then Emerald Jungle in the mid-40s.
