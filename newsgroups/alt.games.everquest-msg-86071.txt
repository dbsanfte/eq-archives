No, if it goes into the empty slot the vendor has NONE of the item
(besides that one)

Nope, doesn't work that way. Any item of a type a vendor has all show
up in the same slot.. that is why if the vendor has more spider silk
and you empty a slot and sell a spider silk into that slot.. its gone
if he has more. If your silk pops up in the empty slot, buy it back,
you are done.
