Agreed totally.  I think one of the reasons Linux doesn't get the
support though is because there isn't a major name behind it.
Somebody like an IBM could drop a lot of money into Linux and
subsidize software development.  After a while it would, hopefully,
get enough of a market share to support itself.  And if it got a big
enough market share it would force Microsoft to actually do some
innovating (something Microsoft IS capable of) and help create
stronger products all around.
