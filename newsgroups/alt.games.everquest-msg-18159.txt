The Overthere is very fast experience. Sol A is an experience bonus zone.
Cazic Thule is pretty good also. Frontier Mountains, Dalnir in Warslicks. I
hear Highpass is good also. Killing Pickclaws? Choon and Froon. Rathe Mtns
for skellies and cyclops. Oasis and a spectre group.

Lots of choices for 30 and up. I did lvl 30 in OT. Fast pull groups will get
you thru hell in no time.
