A: I don't have a dick.
B. There are currently 12 people on my NO list
C: There are currently 22 people on my YES list, (these are people who have
gone out of there way to help me.  Whenever I see them I buff/heal/sow them,
their pets and any friends they might have with them).
D: To each his own - I agree.
