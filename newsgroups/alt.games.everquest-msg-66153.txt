Well, I logged back in, and found no difference.  I can still get the sky
flickering through the ground if I don't have my sky turned off.  That was
the 'transparency' problem I was having....

If they're talking about the transparency of the clothing of the new
character models, then that seems a waste of time.... if the users of the
Intel 810 chip can't hardly play the old world, I can't imagine what it'd be
like if we tried to run the expansion with the character models activated.
