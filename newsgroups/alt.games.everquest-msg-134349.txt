Ya, bored... as in had nothing else to do or say......  
you may or may not know me from my posts.... but I dont think I often
post stupid questions....  my questions may be posed out of Ignorance
of a situation...   
Now, my grammer, and spelling are another issue... I am rather lazy on
that front and really dont care.. yeah I run a spell check but usual
write like I think....

So, as you said: 
"Well, taking into consideration that the new UI just now got patched
to the live servers and the servers aren't even back up yet, I'd give
you 3 guesses on the answer to that.

Patience, grasshopper."

Hopefully by this point you would understand that Im not just asking
to ask... I am asking to get information...
and your response struck me as a friend of mine does... he has a
rapier wit... and usualy does not hesitate to use it... wether it was
warrented or not.
You sir... have one of those wits... sometimes it is rather funny...
on others it can draw blood...  

again... Goot Day to ya...

and with your comment  "Might", and there was the obscure little
tool..  may not work on Live... but it is exactly what I was looking
for.
