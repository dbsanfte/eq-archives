I love my Vah Shir BL, if I was going to make a new shaman,
I'd probably make him a kitty.  I love the pit as a newbie
zone, and the armor quests in shadeweaver are great for an
untwinked (or even lightly twinked) character.  Also, you
get racial sneak and safe fall (sneak is great for getting
merchants to sell to you, and safe fall for running SoWed
over hilly terrain).
