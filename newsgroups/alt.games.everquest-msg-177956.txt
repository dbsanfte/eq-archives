The chanter I play daily with almost got wiped by two greens when she tried
to ToT a caster that was working on her pet.  I was half-across zone and had
to blast a sow potion to get there in time to twitch her .. she was 100%
out of mana.

Haven't had any problems with my heals yet but I noticed that my fear is
no longer overwriting enchanter fear.
