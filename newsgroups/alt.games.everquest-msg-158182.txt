Nope.  I do however think they're incredibly unreasonable to
believe they have a right to skin the other players.  Which
is what all this bitching about the PoK ports presumes.

All analogies are fubar, which was what I was trying to illustrate by
twisting yours, sorry you missed the (painfully obvious) point.

Bullshit.  The Nexus gave us cactus, from which we could squeeze a
drink with difficulty.  PoK gives us water, not quite as good as milk,
but one whole helluva lot cheaper.  Walking and riding the boat, which
between them account for hundreds of hours of my "play" time, are
closer to having to dig a hole, make a water trap, and wait for it
to fill (beats the hell out of dying of thirst, but it's nothing
compared to having what you need already in hand).

Perhaps you should consider the implications of that whooshing
sound above your head.

Well, I wouldn't characterize it as "resorting", it's kinda fun
really.  Other than the rare occasions that I get to hang out with
long-time close friends usenet is about the only place in my life
where I can say what I'm thinking instead of going to an inordinate
amount of efort to express myself in a way that won't hurt little
joimmy's feelings.

Your original analogy:
/quote Ed Jensen
If one of your defining abilities is selling milk, and then
milk becomes free, have you lost anything?
/quote

Now, to be technical, it is not teleporting per se that you are
calling a defining ability here, but actual port whoring.  Still,
it sure looks to to me like you're talking out both sides of your
mouth here, as it were.  Hardly remote, hardly a grand assumption.
If calling you on that makes me an asshole, so be it.

Then why in hell would you care that port whoring is less profitable?
Or did you just have an uncontrolable urge to post a stupid analogy?

LOL.  Thank you.  That's the point I've been having a hard time
making to Ingot.

That's good to hear.

Heh, see above.

Now, now.  It's usually more effective to twist somebody else's
line before you throw it back at them.  :)

Look Ed, I've found most of your posts worthwhile reading, but the
analogy in support of port whoring is just stupid.  And the "grand
assumption" bullshit above is pretty lame in that context.

Overall, I give you only a 7.0.  You suffer, as do I, from wordiness.

thanks for your reply,
Kaev
