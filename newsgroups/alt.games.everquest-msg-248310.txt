Anyone go AFK while working on swimming?  I'm trying to find a spot where I
can just have my toons go AFK while swimming to get the skill-up.  I've got
an Enduring Breath item handy.  I've tried the Shadow Haven pool (zone-in
from Nexus), but I go LD if my Erudite's fat head hits the wall three times.
