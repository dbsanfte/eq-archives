Well, I had to see it, so I bought the new spiral bound EQ Atlas. What a
useless piece of crap. Thank god we have www.eqatlas for real helpful
details.

Each map has like 4-5 points of entry or other basic info, but not nearly
the detail of www.eqatlas.

Plus there is some misinformation. Some poor schmuck 9th ranger is gonna
have his hands full when he wanders into the Dreadlands (monster level
1-10?!?!)  Hehe.

Bad book. Don't waste the money
