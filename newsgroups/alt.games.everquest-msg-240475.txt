I've just reactivated my account after being away for nearly a year,
and I see there is cool nightly undead spawns happening because of the
5 year anniversary or something.

How long are these going to last ? They drop some cool stuff for their
levels.

Do the commanders only spawn once ? I never see them on tracking once
they've been initially killed off, just lieutenants.

Cheers,
