After a week offline I logged in to EQ last night...
to some funny little oddities.  My screen was
set to the second size (800 x 600?) instead
of the normal first size (640 * 480?) so I had
to cycle that off.  Then everything was a bit
choppy.

Ran around a few zones doing this and that
on some of my alts, when my Druid happened
to spot Gore up on track.  Called in the guild
to whack, got my cleric out of mothballs and
got a port in.  Formup was at the tunnel exit, and
when I hit the raid my video choppiness went
thru the roof.  I haven't seen anything like it since
moving off my old P2 100mhz machine.  I ended
up staring at the floor in order to participate in the
raid at all, and I wasn't all that much use even then.

Crashed out on dying (yes, dying from Gore thats
just embarassing) and couldn't log in for ten minutes,
got back just in time to see the bidding for the drops.

Next up was a named in UP, and on the way I
logged out to turn off a few models... to my surprise
every single one of them was on!  Normally I have
just three or four models up, for my races and those
of a couple close friends... no wonder things were so
terrible!

Anyone else see this happen recently?  Things are
still a little choppier than usual, but the game is playable
in raid strength again now that I've turned everything
off (including the few I normally indulge myself with)
