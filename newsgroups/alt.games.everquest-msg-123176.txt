Look at the number of colonies. Counting Earth. Consider the story of
the lost tribe of Isreal.

It does also relate to the wagon train as well...

A lot of the themes were pretty subtle. I suppose as not to scare away
the viewers. ;-p One story that sticks out is an episode where they
meet these super-being aliens. Toward the end, the aliens tell them
that "You are as we once were. You will be as we are" (extremely
paraphrased from memory of a show I haven't watched in
godknowshowlong). One of the Mormon beleifs is that the most righteous
will be elevated at some point after the second coming and become gods
themselves with their own spiritual children and their own worlds. Or
something to that effect. Seminary class was a loooong time ago, and
it's been almost as long since I last even attended church...
