No you fucking don't.

Go browse some of the uberguild rosters.  Some might have as many monks
as warriors and rogues but most do not have anything like it.  They are
stocked high with Warriors, Rogues, Clerics, Wizards.  For sure, Monks
are probably BALANCED in terms of membership, somewhere around the 7%
mark.  But the classes that should be nerfed for being overpowered in
the high end game (justification for the monk nerf) are the ones that
are 15% or more of the roster.

No they don't.  If a Warrior is not allocated to tanking they can
trigger aggressive and do more damage than a Monk.  Period.  Guilding
Warriors means you have an option - tank or do more damage than a monk.
With a monk you get one option and the benefits of that option (damage)
are less than that of a class which gets to *choose*.

The only time to choose damage dealers or roster them in your
hypothetical guild is because they do the *most* damage either
contiguously (rogues, rangers) or situationally (wizards and now mages
and necros too).

Haha.

HAhahahahaha.

I don't believe i just read this on Usenet.  How the fuck can such a
retarded mind configure a news client then post that!

Tanks have 7k HP or more.  Druids can heal 2950 (and 4k with PoP),
Shamans can heal 1850 (and 1850 with PoP).

Who the FUCK did they give CHeal to?

Kragg's mending heals 2 bubbles of health on my Monk.  And he is a long
way from being uber equipped.

The big difference, of course between Slow and CHeal is that CHeal
*ALWAYS* works whereas Slow is situational and becoming more situational
with every single content addition.
