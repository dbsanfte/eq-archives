    Detrimental change from the point of view of players = nerf. Now whether
it was justified, there's the real debate!

    The question you have to ask is this: why change this now, after two
years? It seems to be detrimental judging from the upset mages and druids
out there. It wasn't exactly an overcrowded soloing spot before the change.
So whether the hornets are summoned or not (and I agree flagging them
summoned was silly in the first place), why?

    Here's my conspiracy theory - everyone put on your tinfoil hats! One of
the issues brought up recently by mages during their "whine for balance" was
the lack of summoned critters in the game. The Dismiss Summoned line is
pretty useless, as there's just not a lot of places where the spell works
(compare with Dismiss Undead line). The mages then listed all the places it
works to try and demonstrate how little they could hunt with it. That was a
mistake. Someone at Verant looked at the list, said "Hey, those don't sound
like summoned mobs!" and got them changed. And now there's even fewer places
where the spell is any good.
