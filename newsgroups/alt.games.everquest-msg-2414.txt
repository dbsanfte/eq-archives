No, I haven't had ANY EAX in EQ. Must have something to do with its sound
being based on SB16, the emulation of which SUCKS under win2k.

Why? Well I'm gald you asked.

There is no SB16 emulation in Win2k becuse Creative is trying to move things
along. SB16 came out in '93. Would you still run your 9600 modem, 340MB
soundcard, or god forbid...your 486DX266 now? Probably not, but the geniuses
at Verant needed to draw the line somewhere, and two years ago SB16 was a
safe place to do so.

I am going to be running the WinXP beta as soon as I get it, so we'll see if
MS makes good on it's promise to have SB16 support native to the OS.
