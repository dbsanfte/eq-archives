No it does not prove they are nuetral.  But eventually you can either
find someone to trust, or stick with backstabbing instead.  On MT
the list admin is a druid, actually, but as I said before, one with a
sterling reputation, and she's from a very very small guild.

Thats -up to- 3 hours added.  Real average time per Rage kill is under
20 minutes.  People watch for Rage, and notify the cleric or the guild
of the cleric next up.  Why?  Because this speeds the list up!

OK, mobs that are blue to 60, so its -some- exp.  Yes, no bonus, yes
you -can- do better.  But having spent many many days camping green
zones for one epic part or another, pardon me if the prospect of
maximum 3 days in a zone with actual blue to me mobs doesn't fill
me with dread.

I"m suggesting that any time a guild has a cleric "next up" on the list, that
they make a point of being Rage Ready for the next 3 days.   Of course
once the guild has a single cleric with a rez stick they might lose a lot
of the desire to do so... IMO a good way to lose clerics to rival guilds
though.

With the list, you'd have had 3 hours to finish that kill and get ready for
Rage,
no need to rush or get lucky... unless you weren't next on the list, in which
case you'd still have 3 hours to form up, but you'd have to be lucky in terms
of the "real" cleric not showing up, and then if other guilds were also ready
you'd have a bit of a showdown to deal with.  I've no idea how that has
worked out in practice on MT.

Yep, I agree here, I'd give him a second chance, but then I'd move him to
the bottom of the list.  Not the MT way though, you get to do nothing and
sit at number one on the list forever if you want.  On the other hand, I
don't think there's a cleric out there who has missed more than one, and
most kill first time he pops.

Hopefully people who play on Prexus enjoy that, just as most
people who play on MT seem to enjoy the community plan

Yep, its on the web.  And I suppose you dont'.  Thats why the "trusted
nuetral" is important.  Of course once the list goes up its very easy to
monitor... there are 70 people looking very closely at that list, namely
the clerics on it.  If a name gets added in to the middle, say at number
30, the number 31 cleric is sure to notice.

I also know because the druid in question is a good friend, wife of
a RL friend... and I'm still number 60 on the freaking list.

Hmm, so the "most powerful guild get to set the rules" system sucks.
Big surprise.

But you can't plan things if you need to check a target.  While there
are lots of mobs and even zones where this is the norm on MT,
there are some raids you can (must) plan in advance, as there
is a rotation, calender, or list.  Smaller guilds, or less high powered
guilds, find this is the only way they get a shot at the highly
contested mobs/zones.  Sure FE can put together a raid on
POH on a moments notice, heck so can LoV, the far less
powerful guild I'm currently in... but POH can be done with
effort by a guild of mid 40s to low 50s...only they are going
to have to make sure they get their people online and ready
to go, and those people are -not- going to be used to doing
PoH so its going to take a lot more effort.

One way to do this is with a list, calender, or rotation.  I suppose another
way would be to ask all the guild leaders what they are up to, and yet
another would be to invest the time and energy to plant a spy in each
of the other guilds.  To me that would be in descending order of
convienience and fun, but I'm certainly not every player out there.  Heck,
many people like Red servers!

MT has tons of mobs that work that way.  The bottleneck epic mobs,
though, and some of the more popular "evercleared" zones, are
more organized.

Ragefire would, I think you'll agree, be the best single example of a
bottleneck mob in the whole game; if Verant would raise his spawn
rate to once a day the MT list would still be almost three months long...
but at least you'd have the list getting shorter rather than longer.

> If that voice is big enough, why should it be ignored?

If every mob, every zone, was organized, then you'd have a point.  Most
are not, though, just as most aren't evercamped, so the "I like to
grab my gear and jump out of the airplane" crew don't have much
to complain about.  I like this style of gaming, its one of the reasons
I've moved to my current guild.  On the other hand, the list system
means I don't have to spend the next month in SF trying to gank
Rage... I have the luxury of ignoring him secure in the knowledge
that eventually it will be my turn.

We just had a little showdown over Phinny yesterday.  He's not on
a list.  We showed up in KK with an adequate force but didn't get
our mage down to ledge (he got lost) before another guild managed to
get there.  They pulled Phinny and died.  We moved in to ledge
while they rezed up, and they tried again.  Died again.  Then we
pulled the seahorses one at a time, killed them, killed the Phish,
while they rezed up down under the ledge.  Was FCFS, but
honorable.  I personally think that the FCFS nature of the spawn
is what caused their wipes, they had sufficient force to kill
the same way we did but instead went for the "Phinny and
his guardians" approach... which seems to me only necessary
if you think the other guild in attendance is going to PnP
swipe Phinny while you are killing horses.

Yes of course there are.  I'm suggesting that 10% of average players
are jerks while only 5% of clerics are jerks.  Mind you thats still
a lot of jerks playing clerics.   And its subjective, I havent' put
any effort into compiling a list or taking a poll.

The whole "clerics get all the gems" thing boggles my mind in the
same way that people who are still using autosplit looting do.
Neither makes any sense, although they may seem to to those
who haven't looked closely into the practices and how they cost out.

There are going to be some of these, I agree.  I just find -fewer-
of them than in the average class.
