Does that really make the slightest difference? If the icon -had- 
changed to EQ: RoK, and the login screen said welcome to EQ: RoK... and 
I got into the same game you did without the EQ: RoK expansion would it 
change anything? Would you be playing EQ: RoK? Or would I be playing 
Everquest? Or would we each be playing our own game?

Personally, I almost prefer the latter. We are playing different games 
in some sense. We share some mechanics, but differ on others. Its like 
D&D3 vs D&D3.5 is it the same game? The characters can coexist ... 
mostly.

Everquest 2 kept the name Everquest too.

Nah... its perfectly consistent with the nature of a semantics argument. 
Agreeing on the conclusion while disagreeing on the meaning is par for 
the course. :)
