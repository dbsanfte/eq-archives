What on earth is there in CS that you can't kill as a 54 druid?  My 
cleric was soloing there at 44 quite happily, and he was a far cry from 
well equipped at that time, with a wisdom around 180, no clicky gear, no 
FT, nothing to speak of.  Worked the place on and off up to 54 when I 
gave it up not because it was hard but because there was little there 
still worth killing for exp.

Thats a cleric, mind you, with no snare, TBoots for running speed, 
relatively poor ratio nukes... you know, a cleric.

Not one of the four best nuker classes in the game, with snare and SOW 
in the kit bag.

Are you trying to melee them?

By 54 my cleric could pull that off, but I doubt a druid could.

PS I realize I haven't answered your question, but until I see what your 
difficulty is with Cobalt Scar, its going to be pretty hard to figure 
out a camp spot to suggest
