For the record, before I attained raid levels, I encountered kill-stealing 
quite often. It didn't happen every night, and granted, some zones were 
worse for it than others, but it certainly did happen to what I would 
consider a barely tolerable degree.

I do agree, however, that the system in place in EQ2 is a bit extreme. 
Personally, I don't think that eliminating KS'ing and PL'ing was their 
primary the goal with the locking system. I believe it was more to provide 
them with complete control over combat so as to keep encounter tuning 
headaches to a bare minimum.
