Are you, by any chance, in a guild with some considerably higher level
players? If so, the best no-drop armor option that jumps  to mind is the
stuff that drops off the dorf guards in Icewell keep. But that's
strictly a 50+ camp, so as I said, you'd need help. Pity, because a lot
of it just rots when we camp there.

Planes armor is out obviously... I'm wracking my brain and I'm not
thinking of any decent no drop gear that I picked up at that level. I'm
not even sure there is any. You might try looking at the quests by zone
for the zones that are appropriate to your level. For all I know, VI may
have added in some mid range no-drop quest armor this year.

Good luck. Let us know if you find something good.
