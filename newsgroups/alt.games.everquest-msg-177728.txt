> "O God of Earth and Altar,
> Bow down and hear our cry,
> Our earthly rulers falter,
> Our people drift and die,
> The walls of gold entomb us,
> The swords of scorn divide,
> Take not thy thunder from us,
> But take away our pride."
> (G.K. Chesterton: English Hymnal)
>
> Just a babe in the black abyss,
> No reason for a place like this,
> The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,
> An easy way for the blind to go,
> A clever path for the fools who know
> The secret of the Hanged Man - the smile of his lips.
>
> The light of the Blind - you'll see,
> The venom that tears my spine,
> The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.
>
> She came to me with a serpent's kiss,
> As the Eye of the Sun rose on her lips,
> Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,
> So we lay in a black embrace,
> And the Seed is sown in a holy place
> And I watched, and I waited for the Dawn.
>
> The light of the Blind - you'll see,
> The venom that tears my spine,
> The Eyes of the Nile are opening - you'll see.
>
> Bind all of us together,
> Ablaze with Hope and Free,
> No storm or heavy weather
> Will rock the boat you'll see.
> The time has come to close your eyes
> And still the wind and rain,
> For the one who will be King
> Is the Watcher in the Ring.
> It is You.
