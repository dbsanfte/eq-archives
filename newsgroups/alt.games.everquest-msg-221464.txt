  Honestly, I doubt anyone here is capable of judging that. Even
without instant ports, who here couldn't start a newbie on a fresh
server and trivially level up to 60? Boat rides where always an
annoyance for for, God how I hated going LD zoning into Freeport and
being back in OOT after I logged back on. How about loosing a corpse
due to something agroing on you from sister isle? Sorry, I don't miss
wasting 2 hours of my life getting from Freeport to Butcherblock. 

I'll also never recreate the thrill of running through Oasis with a
newbie monk in the days when nobody could kill giants, trying to get
to the swamp because I'd heard of those uber magic gloves that dropped
there. The risk is gone to a large extent, but so is the tedium.
Closest I ever came to quitting EQ was an 8 hour CR in Fear. Sitting
at the zone line watching multiple guilds wipe trying to get our
corpses had me seriously questioning whether I wanted to keep wasting
time on EQ. 

Is it too easy now? Probably, but I think it's a good thing. It
doesn't bother me that people are 65 in a couple of months now while
it took me over 3 years to get there. I haven't lost anything by
enjoying the trip but people joining EQ now will never have that trip
no matter what. Too many of us are uber and experienced with the game
mechanics for that to be possible again. At least this way, if a
friends joins EQ, they have a realistic chance of actually getting to
be high enough level to group with me. Only downside is that now I
have to teach them how to play once they get to 65. <g>
