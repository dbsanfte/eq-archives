Problem isn't that HE is catching aggro, its the mobs that was running off
and passing others and telling them to attack the two who are after him.

Too low level for me now.  I'm using my leach spell, which itself takes
nearly 50% HP from the mob, and my LV12 lifetap spell, which takes usually
high 30s HP, up to 45 max HP.  Those along with my buff, pet spell, pet
buff, syphon strength, clinging darkness, and gate for emergencies.

But -where- do I get it from?  What zone is easiest?  I need to know where
to buy it from (what zones are most likely to see people selling it, or who
can make it)?

I can't get groups due to my playing time.  Yesterday I was the ONLY one in
the zone.  The day before it was first a LV6, then a LV20 (I'm 12).  I have
to summon my group.
