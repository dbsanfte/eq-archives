I can't speak to sites as large as some of those looking to go
subscription lately, but I, too, have trouble with the 'thousands'
price tag. 

My little site costs me about $7 per month for 6 gigs of data
transfer. While the big sites certainly move a good deal more
information than mine does, I don't think they're approaching
terrabytes per month.

There are a lot of bandwidth saving measures that the big sites might
take. The code could, indeed, be much tighter (I once worked over the
html of the home page at Casters Realm, and found that almost 50% of
it was 'fluff' code that could be removed without any effect).
Standard graphics (logos and such) could be reduced, even a few
percent, in size. Heck, the background image at Allakhazam's is over
5k in size - how many times a day do you suppose that gets downloaded?
I certainly don't need a screen shot of every item in the databases,
as long as the stats are there in plain text. And the endless user
commentary about each item, mob, and quest could certainly be greatly
reduced (maybe weeded out by age).

All that said, however, I can't find fault with Allakhazam's
subscription approach. Everything I use on his site is still free, and
I don't see any problem with adding new functionality that's only
available to paying members.
