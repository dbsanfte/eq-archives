Im a monk, and I solo there by choice.  I can make 10 times the exp solo
than if I group there (assuming its not too crowded, and people aren't being
asses with my pulls)

Velk is different to other dungeons on my server, in that only "named"
spawns belong to camps, all other spiders are FCFS (First Come First
Served... whoever agros first gets it)

There are different interpreations of this.. some people feel *any* spider
except the named is pullable, some respect spiders *inside* the camp but
will pull spiders from the surrounding areas.   i personally do not pull
from inside other peoples camps, and I've lost count of the number of rows
I've had with people about pulling from my camp.. but at the end of the day
theres nothing I can do to stop them.

Im happy to respect the 8 or so mobs that spawn *at* FF as part of their
camp, and the 4 or so spiders above the FF ramp as theirs, what he was
demanding though was over 50% of the outer zone space and spiders, for 1
single group.  There was at least 5 other groups on the lower level, yet he
seemed to think his group had more right to more spiders then all other 5
groups combined

Which can be countered by the bard saying "I agrod first, but your melee
spam pushed it off screen"

i told the warrior his fat ass would never get a rez from me again, and the
stupid rogue... he was /telling his friend how funny it was what he was
doing to somebody in Velk... whilst I was bitching in guildchat, anyway his
friend is in my guild, and promptly told him to go to hell

The bard was the instigator of all the crap though... if anybody deserves
payback its him
