Hey there.
ok is anyone else just totally screwed over since Luclin? We have three
systems with EQ and none will work now.
Computer 1:
Athelon 1.4ghz
Geforce 2 64meg
512 ddr ram
 never did get it running and now after downloading all the recommended
patches and files...now my system is suffering from a total lag in any
program. can't even surf now!!! any ideas? I tried to uninstall EQ to get
rid of all the files but still will not work normally. ( this is so
frustrating as all I did was PAY for the f'ing software thenn all my sh*t
crashes) not a good situation.


System 2:
850mghz P3
Geforce 2 32 meg video card
512 sdram

She was getting kicked all the time then reformatted her harddrive.now we
are having trouble getting it all reinstalled.

System 3:
My laptop which always ran EQ fine. guess I am just scfrewed on 3 fronts and
SONY doesn't care as long as they get their money.

has anyone else had soo much trouble aqnd has any of those forced to upgrade
their systems or been forced to quit thought of taking some sort of legal
actipon? I know that people who knew they can't run LUclin were forced to
get files anyhow and now they can't get in to run it or fix it.

Sorry to rant but this is crap!  can't friggin surf the net because of sony
now!

hmmm.any grounds for a class action lawsuit form all of the folks who have
spent their hard earned cash to only be screwed over by the folks at Sony.
and be forced to either upgarde fe3om what worked before Luclin or to have
to go to

DARK AGE OF CAMELOT

HMMM...Maybe I shuld just say FU sony and give my cash to Mystic. it has its
good point over EQ anyhow...just hate to lose a year of play...anyone want
to buy a 49 druid with some nice stuff =)
