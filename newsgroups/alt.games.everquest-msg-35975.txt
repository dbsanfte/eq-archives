Subject: a MAJOR bug that causes you to die sometimes

There is a bug (you all know it) that when you get disconnected, and signed off
everquest, your charecter stays in the game for 30 seconds, a minute? Something
around that range. This causes you to die sometimes because enemies fight you,
and you cant fight back because youre still "in the game"

I reported this bug NUMEROUS TIMES, daily since about a month ago and they
refuse to get off thier butts (theyre fat programmers who are lazy so what are
we gonna do? lol) So.....i am trying to get them to fix this bug as soon as
possible, so EVERYONE when you log on, type /bug, and report this bug. I bet if
they get thousands of posts abotu this bug, theyll fix it eventually.
