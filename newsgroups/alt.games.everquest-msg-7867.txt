Not really, no - I don't think it qualifies as a nerf. But it will
have a negative effect on the backpack market.

Very possible. The change to make the large sewing kit a ten slot
container hints at interesting things. As of late last night I haven't
heard of anyone discovering any new recipes, but I'd gladly trade the
value of backpacks for some non-cultural path to the high-end
tailoring stuff.

But as you say - this *is* Verant. I think this was really just the
usual short-sightedness that they often seem to suffer from.
