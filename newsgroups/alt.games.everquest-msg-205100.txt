Woe and Envy are easy enough to get but this means about 45 minutes of no
exp time per run; first travel to RM and kill the mobs if they are up, then
go to WK and sit and wait for the wandering spirit to show up so you can
hand in.

If its a decent sized faction hit it might be worth spending a few hours
doing this anyway, exp or no exp, getting a Student's Log is decent exp but
takes several hours on average, plus half the mobs in the stables just went
light blue to me anyway.  If I can max out faction in a few hours of no exp
but make it up by being able to move to a better exp camp the rest of my EQ
life it might well be worthwhile.
