Another one of my pet peeves! People who type in fragmented sentences 
are basically saying I'm an impatient person. 

My motto: If you can't wait until I'm done typing then it's probably not 
worth talking to you in the first place. =)

I was selling a Stein of Moggok a few weeks ago and someone sent me a 
tell asking the specifics of it. It took me a second to right click the 
stein and confirm the stats, maybe 10 seconds elapse before I'm just 
about to hit enter and he sends a tell, "r u there?"
