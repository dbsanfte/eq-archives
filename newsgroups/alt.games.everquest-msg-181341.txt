Yes. Next question?

Seriously, how is it bad to be able to make maps in-game? From an IC
perspective, it makes no sense *not* to be able to do so. As for the
"you are here" markers, in a world of magic and sorcery, why would it
be unreasonable for enchanted maps to show you where you're standing?
(Think Harry Potter's "Marauder's Map").
