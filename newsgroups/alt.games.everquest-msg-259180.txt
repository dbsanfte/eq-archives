Well, I missed that particular boat, never thinking that computer game boxes 
were going to be collectibles someday. Should have known. On the other hand, 
living in the home town of Wizards of the Coast, I have my own share of 
garage sale stories where I bought shoeboxes of these trading cards that 
nobody knew how to value back in those early days.  I more than made up for 
the Infocom boxes. ;-)

Which reminds me, speaking of collectibles. As I was going through my garage 
preparing for our garage sale, I came across some of my old LPs (that's 
vinyl record albums, if you remember hearing about those). One was my 
original Beatles "Revolver" album, autographed by Klauss Voorman, the guy 
who did the cover illustration. I bet that's worth a pound or two ...
