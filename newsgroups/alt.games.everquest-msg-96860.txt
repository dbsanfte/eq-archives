Rites of Passage? Its a game not the damn Marines for krissakes!

Sure speed past 35 levels of the game. Might as well just buy an ebay account.

No the spellbook was a stupid design flaw. I am just surprised it
took them this long to get rid of it. What other game has anybody put
up with staring at a blank screen for hours at a time?

The game is about progress. Slowing or stoping that progress arbitrarily
is silly at best and stupid at worst. I never felt rewarded for finishing a
hell level just relieved.
