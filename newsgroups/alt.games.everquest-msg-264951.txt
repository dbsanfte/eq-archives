Ah, thanks for the tip.  I'd read -- and recently verified -- that
you could teach yourself a language by spamming it while in a
different zone from the rest of the group, but I thought that if
you were in the same zone you had to be listening to someone else's
spam to get skillups.

Even so, the main thing to remember about learning languages is that
you no longer have to change zones for the skillups to take effect,
so if you and a buddy are spamming each other to learn some languages,
you don't have to zone back and forth to keep improving.

When my druid learned the languages to activate the Tainted Heartstone
charm, she also learned a few racial languages (e.g. Barbarian and
Froglok), plus managed to get in a little spell practice, so my log
shows a total of 1579 skillups in just under 4 hours, which has to be
some sort of record for me. :-)
