OK "Brainiac". You are comparing sustained DPS and mitigation against
deep green NON-EXP giving mobs. That is not "Soloing". Your premise
and your conclusion are completely false.

A Druid can quad-kite mobs that an equal level Monk can barely solo in
singles. The Druid will spend time medding, while the monk will spend
time/money on bandages and waiting for mend to recycle. It is a proven
fact that the Druid will kill more exp giving mobs (using the same
zone and the same level mobs) per hour than the monk.

In some situations, but not in ALL situations/zones. The Shaman cannot
quad-kite with DD nukes.

This method is EXTREMELY limited. It only works in out-zones where
pathing and adds can be predicted. Aside from that almost everyone
agrees that Necros are the premier soloers in EQ.

The following is so laughable it is truly sad. I will take each point
individually:

>For melee classes to get over that hump soloing all they have to do is
>mitigate the dammage. 

>My monk does this with a regeneration near 40. 

Not all Monks have Fungi Tunics, or Regen AA points. You cannot use an
a-typical monk to prove your premise.

>A rogue does this using enstill doubt and engulfing darkness. 

ID is not reliable enough for a Rogue to solo. Engulfing Darkness will
DoT and Snare a mob. It will NOT reduce the mobs dagame output. You
don't know what you are talking about

>Warriors do this with weapons that proc a slow spell as well as using defensive. 

Defensive is only available to Warriors at level 55 and has a long
recycle time. Weapon processes are unrealiable. Stick to the
argument....DPS and Mitigation.

>Ranger epics use slow as well. 

Classes aren't born with epics (or fungi tunics, or NToV armor, or
Primal weapons, etc, etc, etc). 

>Then we get to weapons that proc lifetaps and things get
>really interesting. And all of the above can bind wounds to 80% now with

Porcessing weapons are NOT a dime a dozen. Bind Wound over 50%
requires the player to be level 50+. All of the classes you listed
above with the exception of the Necro as so far behind a Druid in
Soloing 1-50 it's a joke to even attempt to compare the.

>Most people dont understand soloing since most really dont want to do it in
>the first place.

Wrong, and you have proven that you are a complete idiot with that
statement. You will find more people playing solo/semi-soloable
classes in EQ than all of the others combined. (PL'd alts and guild
twinks don't count.)

>Soloing can easily slow your rate of exp gain down and certainly reduces your loot
>to basically nothing.

Depends on the class and the mobs you are hunting. Your statement is
too general to have any value

>The question then is why some classes seem to solo so
>often. If the answer is because they cant do anything else, which I think
>happens often, then you have a problem.

The answer is 'Because they can'. 

I am done responding to your posts. If you believe half of the crap
you are posting you are living in your own little fantasy world. You
are completely out of touch with the game mechanics and class
abilities in EQ..
