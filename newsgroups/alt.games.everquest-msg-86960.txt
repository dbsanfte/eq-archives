MT has been. I know. 

The guilds had a tell party last time RF spawned, and it was agreed a
certain guild had the rights in rotation. The list worked then. Of
course they got together quickly and stealthly, and got him as soon as
it was common knowledge.

Most guilds respected the list, but others could have jumped in if the
guild could not.

We are real lucky, most DOODS are still being 733t h4x0rs on DOAC. 
(You know that DOAC is better than EQ, right? Keep telling them that
hehe)
