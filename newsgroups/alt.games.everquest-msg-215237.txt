For that to be true, you'd have to have a court case stating that a
video game clickable EULA was legally binding and therefore was a
legal contract. Even if some other piece of software, such as some
$3,000 graphics package, had been found at some time to have a legally
binding "click" it still might not transfer over to a subscription
video game.

So you have to have step one take place before you can even consider
if the person "signed" a contract.

Really the Eula is nothing more than something to protect SOE and give
them license to give someone the boot, ban them, delete their
characters. Someone could even sue them over that if they felt like
it, possibly winning.
