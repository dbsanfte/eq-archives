i would say that one of the most fun i've ever had with my druid (he can't
taxi yet) is as follows:

okay, i have 6 other chars i play regularly, so i hadn't actually played my
druid in 2 months since a few nights ago . . . SO when i logged him in, i
remembered how SHORT he was, heh, but i laughed and went about helping
tradeskills and such, not really doing any "druid" stuff . . .

i ended up in Nek forrest to make a few char switches, and, low and behold,
i found that guards con blue to me ! so i slayed them, hehe

BUT

i didn't realize it until i noticed some guy was just standing there
"watching" me kite the guards - dark elves cant be druids ! they dont get
sow !
hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha

i started shouting about SOWs to anyone who could give me something other
than cash (just the emotes were worth it - all customs)

i ran up to people (from lvl 1 to [the highest] a 51 vicar) and said,  " I'm
short, have a SOW ! "


no one could stop gasping, and i made lots of friends that night

thus i am a true "dark-elf loved halfling"

you should have been there, it was funny (and you'd have been SOWed)
