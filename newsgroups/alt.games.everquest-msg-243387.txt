Fair? What's fair about my inability to buy decent gear due to insane 
mudflation? What's fair about rewarding people with more IRL money to spend 
than me?

Besides that, you can't sell something you don't own, and the player does 
not own the account or the plat. Try selling your phone account to someone 
and see how the telco feels about it.
