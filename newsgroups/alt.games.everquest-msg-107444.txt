It's always advisable to reinstall sound and video drivers after upgrading
directx. Typical problem for example, if you don't reinstall the video
drivers, is "No 3d devices found" message but I assume you have at least
tried running EQ, in which case you would have spotted that one pretty
quickly. You can always look at Sony's tech help board at
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/forumdisplay.cgi?action
=topics&forum=Technical+Help&number=3&DaysPrune=20&LastLogin= to see how
many people suffer because they don't do it.
