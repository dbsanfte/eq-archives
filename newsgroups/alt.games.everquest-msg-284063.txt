God, that was totally embarrassing. No, it was worse - it was
actually cringe-inducingly embarrassing on a number of levels. I
actually winced when I read it.

I truly and sincerely pity anyone who feels so desperate that they
have to brag about something as banal as a few LDoNs in an attempt to
impress people. It would be embarrassing if people crowed about
getting their *Epic* gear to that extent, never mind preen so
ostentatiously over a few dungeon-runs. 

Honestly, I mean this in all seriousness, and I'm not trying to score
points here or provoke you.  Keep whatever shreds of dignity you have
left and try to avoid posting something as appallingly undignified as
that ever again. You've become a laughing-stock in this group in mere
days with your pomposity and total self-absorbtion and, tragically,
you just can't see it. Don't make it worse by posting something that
reeks of desperation as badly as that did, please, for your own sake.
You can't REALLY have thought people would care, or be impressed, by
THAT?  It's just not going to happen.

No wonder your pal felt he had to post an apologia on your behalf a
short while ago...  It's an act of mercy, on your behalf, when I
killfile you. Truthfully, I pity you.
