Care to expand on this?  I used to use EQWindows way back when, but stopped
when EQ became alt-tab-able.

I honestly don't see any difference in speed in alt-tabbing.  Using plain
ol' EQ and running two instances, alt-tab and boom, I'm in the other EQ
window, no problems at all.  Alt-tab again and boom, in the first EQ
instance.  No lag, no delay, just boom-boom.

EQWindows was just as fast for me when I used it.  But I have to question
how it was *faster*.  They're both instantaneous for me.

Perhaps it's my hardware; I recently got a brand-new computer with all the
bells and whistles.  Perhaps because my computer is so fast, I don't
perceive any lag in switching between modes.  If I still have my old 800mhz
machine, I might notice something.  Is that what you're seeing, Faned?  That
on your machines, there is a noticeable delay in alt-tabbing between two
instances of EQ?  When was the last time you tried running two instances of
EQ?
