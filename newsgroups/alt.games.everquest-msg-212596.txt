From the point of view of the person who believes he does have free will, 
there is no difference.  That does not change the actual fact of whether 
or not he does have free will, merely his perception of it.

You don't have to believe in some omniscient and omnipotent deity in 
order to believe that there is free will, you do have to believe that 
there is something more than just the mere physical existance of the 
universe with a set of physical laws.

To me, free will is the state of actually having a choice, whether you 
believe you have a choice or not.  I believe that I do have free will, I 
could be wrong, but, from my point of view, it does not matter.  If I am 
wrong, so long as I never actually find out that I am wrong, it does not 
matter, from my point of view.  And, that is good enough for me as well.
