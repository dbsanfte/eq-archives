And you're saying that being forced to be apart from religion has no
religious implications?  That would be an interesting point of veiw to argue
from, indeed.  I'll just say this about it "shall make no law" means "shall
make no law."  Think of it as a blank flange, not a check-valve.

Acutally, you didn't make it clear.  Until now, you seemed to be arguing
that religion has no place in school, and it's very presence is an evil
thing.

Which is not radical feminism.  You miss a key word there.

Which is not radical environmentalism.  Again, you miss a key word.

Are you truely that clueless?  Those clammoring for the end to racial quotas
are, for the most part, those who want a truely color-blind society, and
want to end one of the last remaining legal wedges holding the two races
apart.  Racial quotas are racism, plain and simple.  Not everyone is Sen.
Byrd.

Also, I think it's funny how you specifically say that you don't think
reverse racism is ok, but then turn around and make me out to be a racist
for saying the same thing.  Do you even realize that it doens't fit, or are
you that anxious to hang yet another negative label around my neck?

When children are taught that America is the cause for poverty around the
world, and that we brought 9-11 on ourselves, I consider that anti-american,
by definition.  Maybe you can do some linguistic contortion around it, or
you can just call me an imperialist pig-dog and get it over with.

Only if he want's to get an "F" on the paper.  Do you agree that he should
be failed for holding that opinion?  Have you stopped beating your wife yet?

The last part of your paragraph seems counter to what you've said in other
posts.  So, if a gay couple can walk down the hallway, hand-in-hand, and an
offended child can be told to look elsewhere, then it's ok for a child to
say a prayer in the hallway, since the gay couple can go elsewhere?

And, as expected, jodakim tries to pin the "blind faithful" label on me.  If
you don't want to actually deal with my ideas, just say so.  It gets old
when you try to just blatantly disregard them.  It tells me that my ideas
provide too much of a challenge for your well-developed leftist brainwashing
to overcome, so you've shorted out and written me off entirely.  It's like
the bully who says "I could kick his ass any day, I just don't want to."
That's when you know he's whipped.  Now, go get your marching orders from
Dan Rather.

And, no, I don't think you're brainwashed, or get your marching orders from
Dan, but it's the intellectual equal for the accuasations you level at me.
