...needs help.

OK.

Having wasted a pile of hard-to-find scorpion legs and rockhopper
claws once already trying to do the second Vah Shir Beastmaster quest,
I figured I'd better get my tailoring up first. If I'm going to be
condemned to spend my life killing rockhoppers, then, why not make
some money at it? So I bought a 'cap pattern', and, with every copper
I've earned so far on my way to seventh level, a large tailoring kit.

I take the hopper hide and the pattern, and put them in the kit. I hit
combine. "You cannot combine these items in this container."

Sigh.

What am I doing wrong?
