Question What weapons was he using and what weapons are you useing. Are you
over your weight limit. Did he have any haste items? Wus fighting armor will
not make any difference in attack speed. There is no difference in Attack
speed as far as I know in a stripped human and a stripped Ikasar Monk. The
Ikasar will have a higher AC and faster healing over a human but will also
level a little slower.
