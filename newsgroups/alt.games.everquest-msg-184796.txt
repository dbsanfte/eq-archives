I have 2 totally different machines ( one has a 64mb vid card and 1gig 
memory 1.2gig athlon ...the other a 32mb card and 512 memory with a 750 
athlon ). I put my trader up every night on whichever machine is free 
and walk away...I have only been booted a couple times ( aside from 
server downs ) since I started trading and it's always from AT&T 
croaking....would think if there was a SOE "conspiracy" I would be 
dropped more....
