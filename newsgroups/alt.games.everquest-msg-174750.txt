the only thing worthwhile working on is a quest i've read once about in a
post, it's not on allakhazam, but you can combine in a sowingkit 4
gnolscalps combine 4 of those results into one again, and repeat that last
step. I'm still working on it with my new beastie, so i can't tell you the
result yet but it's a fun thing to do and scalps sell for only 4cp anyway so
you may use them to increase tailoringskills. Nearest place to buy a large
sowingkit is in everfrost at the entry of halas. (or take boat to erudin)

check allakhazam for the other items they are documented.
