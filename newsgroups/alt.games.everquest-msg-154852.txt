I didn't really want to set out all the details but since you asked and 
I'm in a bad mood I may as well.
Grrrr, can't find the forum postings where we were ranting about this 
stuff when our guild was stolen by Alyah.  BCoG's forum won't let me 
search more than a month behind.  Not sure of what other sites this was 
discussed on.
/guildleader command sets the leader only.  It does not set the OWNER. 
The OWNER of the guild is the person who made the chat room originally.
That account is forever soulmarked as the OWNER of that guild.  There is 
NO WAY to change the owner.

I learned all this after Alyah was set as leader of my old guild, Circle 
of Majik.  About 2 minutes after she was reinstated by Verant she 
disbanded all the current membership.  Including me who had no idea who 
she was, didn't have anything to do with her, and was totally innocent 
of any controversy concerning the former leadership of the guild.
We considered this a theft or a hijacking.

Alyah was the guild OWNER.  She had given leadership to Gawabiwa.  Or 
maybe she gave leadership to someone else and Gawa inherited it.  I'm 
not sure, I wasn't there.  I was in the guild for about 3 months.  Just 
getting to know people.  I knew Gawa the best because he really took the 
time to lead people.  Not even sure who all were the officers then.

Then all of a sudden, I'm talking in guild chat and the next thing I 
send, it says, You aren't a member of a guild.  I'm like WTF just 
happened.  Takes us a few minutes of frantic tells before we figure out 
that Alyah is the only person in the guild.  This was before the chat 
channels were put in, they would have made things so much easier.  As it 
was, we had 2 or 3 days of shock. Then a few days of standing around 
deciding what to do.  Then a few weeks of fighting VI for our new guild, 
they gave us a hard time for some reason.  Anyway, we finally got 
together in Toxx, had a few duels, drank some liquor and saw Gawa 
annointed as the Leader and Owner of Dignatio cum Demori.  A fine moment.

The last laugh came when we heard that Alyah's guild had been disbanded 
for lack of membership.
