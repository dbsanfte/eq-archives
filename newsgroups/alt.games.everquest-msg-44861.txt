That was exactly the response i got when i petitioned a ld death, that
put me halfway around the world still have no idea what killed me as I
wasn't under attack when i went link dead.  I know now if traveling from
say g'fay to qeynos that it's a wise idea to get bound in freeport, at
least then you don't have to wait on the boat if you encounter a mishap
along the way.  More than anything i was just hoping for a summons to my
corpse, not an exp rez, i wasn't that high level at the time.  It was
with my druid so I must have been 18 if I couldn't port myself to WC
where i died.  No reason for exp rez at 18.
