   Hi Everyone!  Posting from a dialup connection from a Motel 6 and
using Google groups for the first time, so forgive me if I screw up
the basic formatting.

   Anyhoo...  Reading this tread, I feel compelled to talk about us
perpetual lowbies of EQ.  I've been playing this game for almost two
years.  I've had alot of fun doing so.  My highest character is 37,
and mostly I play ones that are 30 or under.  I don't think that very
many experienced players would be very impressed with any of the gear
on any of my girls.  But that hardly matters to me.  I have fun doing
what I do.  I get my 45$ a month (3 accounts between my husband Lenny
and I).  I enjoying starting untwinked on a brand new (to me) server. 
I like trying new race/class combos.  I like typing in the chat
channels, even if I am known for not being good at having multiple
conversations.  I might sooner or later get a character into the 40's,
or even higher... but I'm not in any particular hurry to do so.

   So, am I playing the way that Sony intends for me to do so?  I
dunno.  Am I playing the way the majority of other players think is
right?  I don't give a rat's ass.   Am I experiencing all that the
game has to offer?  Certainly not.  But that's fine, since I am
getting what I consider to be my money's worth.

Off topic for a quick sec... I've missed you guys!  And EQ, of course.
 
Scene:  Lenny and I rolling in a rented truck across the country.  

Lenny: Hey, did you see that skid mark?  I wonder what the heck
happened there.
Me: Yeah, I bet someone had a fun driving story to tell.  So...  How
long till I can get back online?
Lenny: I told you, this fucking truck doesn't have internet access. 
Drop it!

Traveling is fun my ass.

Annie
