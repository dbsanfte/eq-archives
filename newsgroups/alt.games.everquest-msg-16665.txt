Offhand, I'd suggest unloading the MQ pelts.. most tailors nowadays
just stockpile on silk, and skip the studded/reinforced stages of
skill building.  Take your HQ pelts and haul them over to East karana,
there's usually a lot of cat farmers looking for HQ pelts, and will
probably be more tan willing to buy your stock.
