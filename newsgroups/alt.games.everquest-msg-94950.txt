Sure, but that's a variation on 3.

My point was that why would Verant (allegedly) get really
grumpy about you doing #2, but (apparently) be happy, and
perhaps even expect, you to do #3, when it's hardly any
different.

Either way, you're getting bardly skill-ups without having
to do any keyboard juggling of your bard, or risk death
fighting mobs, etc.

Thus, my wonderment at the story about Verant supposedly
getting irate about afk bards.
