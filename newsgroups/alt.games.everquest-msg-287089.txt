dunno what that means, can't play drakkin on Combine, don't care about 
tribute and don't make cultural armor... pretty sure I don't care what 
that means then.

Nice... now clean up every other item in the game, so all items with no 
use say so (maybe say Vendor Trash) and all items that are quest or 
tradeskill say so as well.  Right now those tags are useless since they 
are so often wrong.

They stack to 20 now... guess they will stack to 100?  Thats cool if 
you're farming for a long time in one spot, but I usually just have a 
couple

This was the problem that was killing people's bank inventories?

Yeah not Combine stuff

This is combine stuff; they killed the old research system and the low 
level stuff needed for making spells wasn't available where they said it 
would be.

Saw reports on combine of this stuff dropping now in the brief time 
server was up before it went down for a repatch

Not a JC person so I don't know the details here, but Im sure there's 
much rejoicing

Abilities tradable?  WTF?

Promises promises, this has to be one of the most frequently broken 
events in the game.  Good news for some people though to be sure.

That was a nuisance.  Not a huge one, but a nuisance.  OH, not just LON 
familiars by the way, the mushroom one from the Tox halloween quest was 
doing the same thing.

I don't know what this means, and I'd like to.  Rune of Decay still has 
an hour duration.  Since the only difference between Rune of Decay and 
Augmentation of Death was that it had a faster recast time and a much 
longer duration, if all pet haste spells are the same (in this way) this 
would be pretty messed up.

Have they? Cause nobody seemed to be able to find them on Combine in the 
interval between Patch and Repatch.

Speaking of which, where is the Silverwing Quest guy that they were 
supposed to move from CR for the Combine folks?  Still missing too.

You fixed recipes for things that weren't even dropping before?  How did 
you know they were broken?  I can't believe you're suggesting you 
actually did some research instead of just waiting for complaints to 
tell you what's broken!

Umm... like what other abilities?  I can't think of any offhand.  None 
that HT seemed to interfere with anyway.  Guess I missed it. Probably 
I'm glad.

Zoning?  Try when illusions wear off!  Or did you think the sleeveless 
look was voluntary?

Sweater Vest, you'd think it would be more than a sweater, but its more!
