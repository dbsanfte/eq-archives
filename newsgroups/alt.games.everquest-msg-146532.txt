That's one definition of adultery, and on that particular one I agree
with you. However, the term has been used to describe other sexual
behaviors that people find disagreeable. Some would say it applies to
sexual relationships between consenting unmarried heterosexual adults.

Christians still make false claims about non-Christians. I've been
called a Satanist because I wear a pentacle, for example, even though
my faith doesn't even include such an entity.

Seems to me that "thou shalt not steal" pretty much has that covered.
Coveting is not theft.

Some of the Commandments were *never* related to US law, modern or
otherwise. In fact, the Constitution specifically contradicts the
commandments in at least one case.

>All you've proven is that they are religous in nature

Thank you - that alone is enough to make them wholly inappropriate for
a public venue.
