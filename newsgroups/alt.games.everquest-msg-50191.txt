Aye, that it 'tis. I love my Chanter..

At 8th level, your group and solo spell line ups are (almost) identical.

Spells common to both Solo and Group play:
  Tashan
  Root
  Mesmerise
  Color Flux

Those four (or their big brothers later in their spell lines) you'll
probably never even think of adventuring without. Those 4 by themselves
can keep you and your entire group alive even against the worst of pulls.

Your other four slots? Best nuke (Chaotic Feedback), best DoT/DeBuff
(Suffocating Sphere) your pet spell (don't ever un-mem this when solo) and
the last is optional. For solo, I'd pop Fear in there and do a little fear
kiting, although your early fear spell doesn't last very long at all.

In a group? At 8? Hmmmm. Gate would probably be a good call. Or nice
debuff like Enfeeblement, although it's assistance in a group fight is
minimal at best.

Fighting solo: Pull with Tashan, get hit, let your pet kamikazee on the
mob, and make sure you KEEP YOUR PET ALIVE by tanking for it when
needed. Tash, get hit, step back and let pet engage. Lob your DoT in, wait
till mob is down to last 3 bubs of health, and then nuke-race your pet for
the exp. (You have to do more than 50% of the damage or your pet will
steal 50% of the exp from you)

Group fighting: Have your pet up but don't get hit. It's there strictly to
grab agro in case a mob gets away from the tank and charges after you.
Your job is to root-park or mezmerise the adds. This will be extremely
tough on you as your group-mates at these levels have NO CLUE how to fight
with a good enchanter. They will break your mezzes, they will not taunt
before breaking mez, the beastie WILL agro on you and you WILL die because
your group is inexperienced. Or worse, they won't taunt before breaking
mez and the beastie immediately launches in a sprint for your cleric.

Speaking of which...

One bit of advice that has kept me alive when all others have
died... another chanter drilled this into my head and she was spot
on. It is the cardinal rule of good Chanters (I consider myself one):

In a group situation with a cleric, your SOLE PURPOSE IN LIFE IS TO KEEP
THE CLERIC ALIVE. (Yes, I'm shouting)

If the cleric dies, you die, and almost always vice-versa. Make sure that
everyone knows that if the cleric draws agro ONLY YOU deal with it. You
mez that beastie immediately. Your cleric should learn to calmly sit there
and take the hits until you have the mob under control. The cleric is more
important than you are, and if the tanks are all getting pounded into goo
by a Sand Giant and so much as a skunk jumps the cleric, -take care of it
right then and there-. By the way, if the cleric gets jumped by a skunk
and ever says these four dreaded words, then calmly gate out of there
because your group is doomed. Any cleric that says these four words during
a group fight needs to be taken back to Clerics 101 and schooled in "You
are either medding, buffing, or healing". The four words:

"I can handle it"

When you hit 12th and again at 16th, your tactics change dramatically.
Come back and post then ;-)
