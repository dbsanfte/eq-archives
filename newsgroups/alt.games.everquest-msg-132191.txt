I hate to burst your bubble , but I was a perfectly fine druid. It was the
hardest to level. If you find this so hard to believe I suggest doing it
yourself or asking those who have leveled more than one class.

My druid wearing flowing thought 6 cannot approach the exp soloing my monk
can. The druid also benefits from kodaics at all times. While druids are the
very best at avoiding dammage in combat they absolutely suck at dishing it
out. Soloing requires both a dammaging side and a mitigation side. Druids
dont do dammage worth a crap. On the other hand monks do dammage like crazy
but there mitigation is significantly lower. The combination of dammage and
mitigation favors monks by a large margin.

I rarely play my chanter on raids , instead playing him mainly in groups.
Every raiding guild has far more chanters than they actually need at a raid
, so only those that can only play a chanter end up playing them on raids.

It is ridiculously easy to kill an exp mob with a druid. What you are
forgetting though is the TIME it takes to do so. It is ridiculously easy for
MOST classes to kill an exp mob solo. The only rate that really matters for
experience is amount per time period. If you are soloing for loot the only
important factor is size of mob that you can take solo. My chanter can
easily solo 4 rooms in sebilis, is your druid capable? My monk can keep 5
katta guards dead when soloing for exps at 57 , can your druid come close to
competing? I hate soloing but both my monk and chanter are BETTER at it than
my druid.

This would all be fine if druids happened to be good groupers. They are only
fair groupers though and the worst raiding class bar none.
