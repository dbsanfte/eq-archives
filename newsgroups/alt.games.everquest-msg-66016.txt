I have found the upgrade to be quite buggy. People floating in the air, =
slowly sinking as you apprach them, views of the inside of your head =
when in battle, slide show frame rates when in popular areas (i.e. =
Tunnel entrance in EC).

Hopefully, the slow frame rates will be solved with my incoming =
(Tomorrow) memory upgrade from 384MB to 640MB.

Current system config:
Athlon Thunderbird 1 GHz @ 1.1 GHz

ASUS A7V motherboard

384 MB PC-133 SDRAM @ 146 MHz

IBM Deskstar 20 GB 75GXP ATA-100 7200 RPM hard-drive

Pioneer DVD-115 16x/40x DVD-ROM drive

Hewlett Packard 9110i CD-RW 8x4x32

ATI RADEON VIVO w/64 MB DDR (retail)

3Com Etherlink XL PCI NIC

SoundBlaster Live! Value

Optiquest V75 17" monitor

InWin Q600 full tower case w/ 300w PS
