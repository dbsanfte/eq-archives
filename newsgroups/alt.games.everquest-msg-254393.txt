    D'oh!  The ole "No, you're STILL in our world" mistake.  I can
understand how it happened to you though.  I cancelled my account last
week,  and though I know it runs through September, it still was pretty
hard to hit the button to make it happen.

    Wheee!  For my part, I'm not planning on leaving a.g.e. totally, though
my responses to gameplay issues will be much more limited.  I still think
that Everquest is the biggest, best, and most successful MMORPG ever
launched, and I am still interested in how it evolves.  Plus, I have every
intention on continuing to maintain the FAQ.  If nothing else, to save the
"Curse of FAQ" from driving some other poor soul away.

   Exactly the same here.  I've found out that I don't really like the
higher end game, and I've done the lower end game to death.  I just simply
burned out.  But no, no one can have my stuff because I know that I can
always reactivate my account at a moment's notice, and I never know when I
might get bit by the bug again.
