I saw that.  It explains the process well, but it really did not address any 
of my specific issues.

1) Where to get decent bags?

2) Where to get mats?  Are all the nodes random?  If so, fuck that this 
system blows.  I tried to harvest some roots in the Ruins zone outside of 
FP.  I saw tons of garden nodes, not much of anything else.  In 30 minutes I 
saw 2 roots nodes...for a whopping 3 roots total.  Then the server went down 
and when it came back up, I had no roots (or any of the other stuff I had 
gathered).

3) What to skill on?  Assuming I can get mats and there are better places to 
hunt them down...what should I skill on in order to be able to make spells? 
Does it matter?

The system seems too deep for its own good, especially coupled with the SOE 
mantra of half-assing new content/game mechanics.
