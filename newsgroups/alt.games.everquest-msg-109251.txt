Just moved over to Stormhammer under a week ago. It really suits me as a
soloing Necro because the less people the better ; )  In the week I have yet
to meet a single pinhead and have not even seen a single Morons'Rus
ooc/shout session.

Playing from the opposite timezone I even noticed there was events on at
those times I could catch them as well which was a pleasant surprise. There
must have been some feedback about the high level orientation of the
organised events as there have been some dedicated lower level stuff as
well, one in Blackburrow lately and a 35-50 event last night in Nth Karana.

Do not expect to be able to group a low level character up the levels.
Majority of players are 50-60 but there are some raising majorly twinked
alts of course. If you are a solo player with a soloable character this
server is heaven.

I dropped a surname over the weekend at what must have been 1am US time or
something equally ridiculous - it was resolved before I had medded my mana
bar back up on the 25 Shadowknight.

The new uber zone they put in is 55-60 so I haven't checked that out of
course (summon - <splat> - repeat). I have noticed some extra NPC's
wandering around but haven't picked up any unique items yet. I am starting
to suspect the lower than 55 new mobs (and hence gear) are in east freeport
but that sort of info is hard to find and I have tracked down very little. I
haven't found any new maps on EQatlas or any decent info on any of the sites
I have looked on yet. Seems if they post a single Legends only item then
they get a montrous thread of people ragging Legends. If anyone has found a
site with a bit of legends content please let me know by the way - would be
much appreciated ; )

The web integration is less than useless I found. I spent 20 minutes trying
to use the map but discovered the paper one in the box set was better. No
zone connections, no current location (that I could get working) and no
zooming down to anything usable whilst in zone. Pure useless eye candy.
Again - the character screen was eye candy or worse still - dick waving
material. Not my cup of tea. Not sure about the guild stuff as I am a
dedicated unashamed anti social git ; )

I would imagine life would be very hard for wankers. No pick up groups means
your reputation is <all> important. You pay for your sins.

I would recommend anyone give it a go for a month at least if you can afford
it. I would have trouble moving back just because of the atmosphere. It's
like, all the pinheads were taken out back and shot and everyone else was
force fed prozac to banish all unhappy thoughts.
