But remember, as a large race (ogre/troll/barbarian) you can still dual
wield and use bash/slam. So if you can get 2 really nice 1hs/1hb/piercer,
you can still outdamage many of the 2hs weapons, and continue to bash away
at casters. This is especially nice if you are the main taink in the group
and expected to hold aggro.

Keep slashing,
