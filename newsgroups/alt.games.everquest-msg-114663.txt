Ok, this is MY resist kit at level 60. so you probably
dont want ALL of it ;)

Dark Assassin boots (used tribal war before these)
Triumphant Mask/Golden Diamond mask/Electrum Diamond mask
Electrum (?) Blue Diamond earrings (these are *great*)
Blue diamond Tiara/Helm of the tracker (used crown of the froglok
	kings before)
Blue diamond pendant/Shaded mask (?) from Maidens
Poison vine belt
Phase spider carapace
Flayed paebella gloves
Bracer of quickness
Velium diamond rings
Blue diamond bracer


I would suggest the earrings first - Blue diamonds are going
to be freaking expensive now though, with the new cultural
stuff... if you're lucky you *might* find someone camping in
seb who hasnt realised how much the price will go up yet.

The earrings are good because they have sizable resists but
dont entail a particularly large AC/HP hit; I would suggest
looking at all your replacements like this. 

The BD bracer, for example, while it has nice resists means
losing a LOT of AC, hp, etc, for me, so I rarely use it,
even though the resists are very good.

I would suggest, then

Diamond rings
BD Earrings
Diamond mask

as your first player made bits. Prior to the kit above I carried
a larger one, with individual pieces that are very cheap but
not as "covers every resist". Theres a nice +20 sv cold
cloak from permafrost, +poison resist bracers in guk, +cold
resist bracers in permafrost, +cold/fire resist crown in
lguk, and so on.

When you find something with good (more than 10) resists on it,
packrat it until you can afford a good all purpose replacement.
