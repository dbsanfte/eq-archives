Y'know, I just today grouped with a guy who was complaining about how
his guild wouldn't help him with his epic.  Conversation went
something like this:

Me: Wow, that sucks. What's the problem, not enough people, or people
just won't get out there and help?
Him: Neither, they want me to be a full member before they'll help me.
Me: Uh... well, that makes sense, actually.  Do you have to wait long
to be a full member?
Him: 12 days.

Ryou

(not in my guild though, so at least it ain't in guild chat ;))
