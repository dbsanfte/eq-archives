Hail friendly travelers. If I may, I need direction in the ways of grouping.
I am a lvl 9 Druid who has got this far just soloing, but feel the need for
companionship. If you would be so kind as to enlighten me on what my duties
would be for an out door group, I would be much obliged. I understand this
is a broad question, so let me try to narrow it down to a piticular type of
MoB. Let's say I want to join an Orc group in EC. This piticular group
consists of a Warrior, Monk, Paladin/SK, Wizard, Cleric, and me (the Druid).
Also note we all are with in a lvl or two of each other and have all our lvl
spells. What would be my main function (being the Druid) in this group?
Also, if the Cleric was exchanged for a Shaman, what would be my main
function? I do thank all who take the time to help me in any way you can.
Save travels to all....
