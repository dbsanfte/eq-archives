Yes, all large cash costs should be covered out of the group
income before the split.  This doesn't mean that a scheme like
"clerics get all gems" makes sense, that can mean no recompense
at all or it can mean a hundred times what the group cost you. 
But its not really hard to keep track of what you spend and get
that back when splitting up.  Typically enchanters use much
cheaper spells than the ones the cost peridot, but if the
situation/tactics called for peridot use then they can easily
burn thru lots more cash than the cleric did.  If your plan calls
for shaman potion DS on the MT then the cost (not cheap at all)
of that should come out of the pot before division.  This may
sound like a slippery slope, but really there aren't -that- many
genuinely expensive expendibles that most people will use in any
real volume, and if profit is any motive for whatever you are
doing, then its only fair to take costs out of the gross in order
to calculate the net.

The warrior mentioned elsewhere in the thread who suggested that
the group also cover his armor and weapons costs if they are
going to cover peridot et al misses the crucial distinction;
weapons and armor never run out, you don't have to keep buying
them again and again.  Since they aren't consumed, they don't
have to be replaced, so they are no different than the ID IV
items the nukers are sporting or the IH III items the healers are
wearing; the split gives everyone an even profit so that they can
all eventually afford upgrades.

A  self buff that is cast once and left up for an hour or two
probably isn't worth worrying about in terms of split.  But one
like a chanter rune that might get cast with every pull can
easily cost dozens of times what the cleric laid out for his long
lasting HP/AC buffs; this is a larger issue when the Symbol line
is being used, and thats the real birthplace of this whole issue,
when you have to eat 6 peridot every 40 minutes to keep Symbols
up its very different from having to use 6 every 2 hours for
Temperance, and very very different from using 2 every 4 hours to
keep Aego or HOVirtue up.  High level clerics usually just shrug
off any attempt to worry about the peridot costs, which are
trivial in proportion to the group income in most cases, a mid
50s cleric who is using symbol for the higher than temperance HP
boost is in a very different situation.
