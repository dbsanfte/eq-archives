I'm waiting for Fileplanet to release another batch of beta spots, and
wondered if it was possible to download the client in advance ?

As it's so big, I'd like to have it waiting to be installed, if I
should be lucky enough to get a key in the new few days.

They got them hoppy legs and twitchy little noses !
And what's with all the carrots ?  
What do they need such good eyesight for anyway ?
Bunnies !  Bunnies !  It must be BUNNIES !
