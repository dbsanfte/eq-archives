Speaking as a druid, who often backs up main healer.

I actually see it more as a waste of my mana, not the clerics.

Lets face it, you were casting anyway, so you were always going to use your 
400mana.

I see tank still taking damage.

How many seconds since you cast? 4, 5, 6??

Oh well Tanks still taking damage. I cast my 700mana fast heal.

It hits just before yours.

NM, tanks alive, and its my mana that could be construed as the one thats 
wasted. Yours was gonna land anyway.

And just another point.

What happens if you happened to move, or have your spell interupted after 7 
seconds for E.G?

Hmm too late to cast another Cheal. Druid too busy nuking. Dead tank.

And finally, whats to stop you "ducking" once you see the other heal 
landing?

Ok, I can see your point regarding a sense of not being trusted.
But lets be honest, 2 heals are better than none.

But talk to your back up healer. 99% of us druids are fine.

Just my thoughts
