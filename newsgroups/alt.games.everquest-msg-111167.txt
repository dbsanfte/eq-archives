I've killed lots of cats in SB and have never seen a ruined pelt drop. It's a
tailor's dream.

At 30 you can do very well kiting along the south wall. There's a single kobold
camp  at -5000 +1000. You can kite to the west of this camp without too much
risk of adds.

There's a big boulder immediately to the east of this camp that is a safe pull
spot for root/nuke. There will be plenty of green leopardesses in this general
area. Be careful; there is an animal path just to the east along which
higher-level animals travel. Kill emerald adders for experience while waiting
for cats to respawn.

There's a kobold camp on the waterfront at -4500 -3500. There's a flat spot on
high ground overlooking this camp at about  -4500 -3000. This is a safe pull
spot and overlooks one of the animal paths. These are tougher mobs; however,
I've got a wiz friend who leveled from 35-45 here solo. A Kejekan will wander
through the kobold camp and it's fun to watch the fight.

The "new zone tunnel" on the East wall at  +2000 -3750 is a popular pull spot.
You can med inside the tunnel without fear of aggro. Just be aware that the
farther north you go, the harder the mobs get.

/con the first Kejekan you see. I don't know what they think of Trolls. If
you're dubious then don't kill them; you might be able to sell in the Kejekan
village at +1250 -500. Be aware, though, that aggressive animals will wander
through the village occasionally and the Kejekans won't help you if you get
attacked.

Take some time out to go sightseeing. Invis up and follow the stream north to
the waterfall. It's worth the trip.
