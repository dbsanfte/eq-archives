Only if the EQ universe is ten times as large as Douglas Adam's.

Would everyone really settle on the same joke by chance?  What
about 230, if that logic applies?  Or 451?  That one at least is
the actual number, not a multiple.  1856 would be a strange choice.

The point of the different assigned rolls was to eliminate a cheat
someone had made that faked a roll in a given range.  By making
the range unpredictable, you multiply the difficulty of faking the
roll by 16000 or so (I forget what the largest random number
EQ will generate for you is) in theory, but doing the seed from
1 to 1000 cuts it to just that range (still plenty) while picking 420,
the number picked 9 times out of ten in groups I've been in, eliminates
this completely.

The Seed system is not immune to hacking, though it would appear
1000 times (or whatever) more resistant... this is an illusion, unless
you are the person generating the seed.  Otherwise, the same hack
that lets someone fake a roll can be used to fake a seed, thus imparting
an air of authenticity.

This isn't the sort of thing that bothers me much, since I really
discount
the risk of encountering all that many people who are hacking their
rolls in the first place, but I think the self evident weakness in the
concept
means that people are going overboard in working to eliminate it.

And I think /ran 420 is the silliest effort to do so.
