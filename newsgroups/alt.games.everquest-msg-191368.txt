I don't think I've crashed to desktop while actually playing (has
happened a couple of times in the bazaar) since the "crash on zoning"
problem was fixed. If I have it can't be more than once or I should
have remembered. So it's certainly specific to something that doesn't
apply to me. And I don't have exotic hardware or anything, an Athlon
XP 2000+ and an NVidia Geforce4 on Windows 2000 with generally the
latest drivers.
