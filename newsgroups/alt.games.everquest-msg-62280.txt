  As others have mentioned, it's best to just run EQ without IE in the
background.  The best thing to do, in fact, is shut down EVERY application
other than EQ... you may even want to go so far as creating another username
under Windows which can act as your "EQ mode" where no programs run on
startup.  Obviously since you can't use those programs, there's no point in
having them running... all they do is eat up resources and potentially
interfere with the proper operation of EQ.

  If, for some reason, you NEED to have IE running (or an application that
perhaps uses the IE engine) while you have EQ running, you can stop pop ups
by disabling Java and ActiveX scripting in Internet Explorer.  To do this,
in IE click View, then Internet Options, click the Security tab, press the
"Custom" level button and scroll down and select "disable" for
scripting/Active scripting.
