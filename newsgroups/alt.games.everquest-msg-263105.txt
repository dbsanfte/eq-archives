Maybe a fifth archetype of buffer/debuffer, but that wouldn't really 
stand on its own too well. Perhaps an assumption that those abilities 
would be given to some of the primary four?

I think actually it is about the total package, including group and raid 
desirability as well as solo ability and utility/convenience abilities. 
People have jumped up and down for a long time about rangers needing 
"fixed", for example, but there sure a lot of them around still. I think 
as long as it's evidently working for people, they should be left alone. 
Shaman, on the other hand, are becoming more and more rare.

I'll try to defer to your greater pool of experience here, but I will say 
that this has not been my experience. We use our warriors, paladins and 
shadowknights almost interchangeably, with warriors being the first 
choice, as it should be. If you're talking about the very top end, then I 
would reiterate the author's point of caution regarding applying that 
testimony to *all* shadowknights.

That does make sense.
