According to Verant, Sony etc. you have to have one game for each
account that you want to run.  I know of people that run four
characters at the same time.... yes i said four... 4, i don't know how
I'd keep up with that personally, but i know of one person that has
all four of his characters at 60+ and they got there at approximately
the same time..  one thing for sure, he always has a group when he
plays!  He bought four computers and four copies of EQ. 
a freind of mine and I have each others user and pass so that if we
want to play a diff char and one of us is offline we can switch.
It is possible to two box on one machine, it is kind of tricky and if
your puter doesn't have at least a 1.4 ghrtz processor and at least
256mb of ram and at least a 64mb video card, i wouldn't recommend
trying it. 
my 2cp worth...
