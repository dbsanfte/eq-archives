Find a map site, e.g. www.eqatlas.com.  Or, if you don't want to be
spoiled that badly, your game manual has a map that is vaguely correct.

Deathfist orcs hang out in the West Commonlands and East Commonlands
near Freeport.  For your Iksar monk, you could go:

	East Cabilis => West Cabilis => Warslik Wood

	west across Warslik to a /loc of about +100 on the west wall
	lots of stuff to dodge in there and not much visibility.
	SoW recommended.  That takes you into the Overthere.

	Northwest across Overthere to the Evil Outpost on the north
	shoreline.  You may have to dodge some mobs but visibility is
	good.  Stay on the outside of the walls.  You're KOS
	within.  Put your clip plane way out and watch for the
	boat.  Swim on board.  (Takes practice)

	Boat goes past the docks.  Stay away from docks.  You're KOS
	there.  Boat zones into Timorous Deep and docks there.

	Dodge Ogres as you go north and west around the rocks to
	a beach where you can pick up a raft.  Swim on board.
	You may have to wait 10 or 15 minutes for the raft.

	Raft goes to Oasis and docks.  Get off and head north along
	the shoreline to North Ro.  Beach is well hunted and
	you should be safe.  Crocodiles, caimans, scarabs,
	spiders and snakes aren't aggro.  Drybones, mummies,
	madmen and sand giants are.

	Northwest across North Ro to find a tunnel in the west wall
	behind a pillar near the edge where the sand turns to grass.
	Not much to aggro on you in North Ro.  You can outrun
	mummys.  Don't get near the madmen unless you've gotten
	a SoW.  Spiders, snakes and scarabs aren't aggro.

	Follow tunnel to East Commons.  Note wide area with vendors
	who will actually (I think) sell to you.

	Stay on south zone wall of commons and head east to Freeport
	Get bound right at the edge of the Freeport newbie area.

	Head back into East Commons and hug the _north_ zone
	wall.  Head west to find the two orc camps.

	The path that runs east/west through the middle of the
	East Commons zone can be trouble.  There are inns and
	guards.  Stay north or south and you'll be OK.

	You'll want to be at least level 8 to think about getting
	an orc group.  I waited until level 30 and pounded the
	little green chumps for faction.  There are lions, bears,
	shadow wolves and the occasional griffon in East Commons.
	The snakes, spiders and scarabs aren't aggo.  Scarabs
	are good experience.  Snakes have nasty poison.

	Orcs drop Deathfist Slashed Belts.  If you collect five
	or six backpacks full and get a druid to cast shared
	wolf form on you, you can head into Freeport and find
	a captain on the balcony inside the Freeport Militia
	house who accepts the belts and gives faction with the
	freeport guards.  Unfortunately, he takes away faction
	with the Paladins in North Freeport who guard the bank.
	No matter.  A thousand or so orcs and the Paladins will
	respect you again.

	I just did this with my Ogre.  Worked great.  It's been
	a long time since I tried with my Iksar monk.  (He used
	invisibility and sneak rather than wolf form -- there
	are guards who see through invis.  Feign death helped.

	The first camp you hit in WC (Orc 1) is a tough nut to crack.
	Attack one orc and the rest will come to help him out.
	Legionairres spawn regularly and you get the occasional
	Lord Shin Ree.  There's a lone orc on the back hill
	that can be taken individually.  There are around seven
	orcs total.

	The second camp (Orc 2) is smaller and easier.  It
	is a five spawn if I recall correctly.  One of the orcs will
	wander off if given a chance.

	West from East Commons is West Commons.  Home to pumas,
	bears, young kodiaks, kodiaks, a dervish camp, another
	orc camp and a druid ring.  If you hug the north zone wall
	you can proceed to the Kithicor zone in the northwest corner.
	Wait until daylight (8:00 am game time) to enter.  Undead
	infest the forest at night.

	The WC Orc Camp is rather nice.  The Orcs are paired and
	you will only pull two at a time.  One at the campfire
	on the upper ledge is a single.  One other orc will wander
	off if given a chance.  Total seven orcs.

	You'll pass it shortly before you hit the second Dark Elf
	encampment which is in turn shortly before the Kith zone.

	Proceed west across Kithicor, hugging north zone wall if 
	you like.  Not far from the north end of the west zone
	wall is the zone into Highpass.  At level 16, you can
	group up and kill Orcs at this end of Highpass.  These
	orcs are a cut above the Deathfist orcs you've gotten
	used to.

Wolf form works nicely if you can get it.  But it doesn't work
everywhere.  Sneak and feign death work too -- if you're brave.
