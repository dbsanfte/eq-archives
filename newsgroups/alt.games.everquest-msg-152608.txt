I have to agree to some point on this. Its totally reasonable to talk
pros&cons about EQ here, but some people just dont understand that EQ can
have cons/negative/stupid sides too. Those people blindly look the other way
and shout "troll" (which i think is an ignorant thing to do). Everything has
pros&cons.

Lastly, most people who use the term troll are just noobs that learned a new
l33t word today. Us l33t0 m0f0s long timers dont use it c0z itz l4m3.
