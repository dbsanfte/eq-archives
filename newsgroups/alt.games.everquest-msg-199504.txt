The person casting KEI is using his game time to provide a service that 
many people are happy to pay for.  I assume the liklihood of it, and/or the 
research components for it, dropping is somewhere around the same liklihood 
as for my missing level 60 spells.  Many people have little choice but to 
buy it.  Nobody is forced to pay for someone casting KEI on them.  Many 
people are more than happy to pay for the service.
