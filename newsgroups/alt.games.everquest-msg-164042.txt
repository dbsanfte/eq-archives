I couldn't disagree more.

For years (literally), I've felt that the slow mana regen rate
in the game was one of the biggest mistakes, biggest balance problems,
biggest timewasters, and biggest flaws in the game.

It was the root cause of many, many other complaints that players
had, and it drove such issues as camping a spot instead of dungeon-crawling,
etc. etc.

Now with KEI, the game finally approaches what I consider an
appropriate level of mana regen.

It was *long* overdue.

Utter, well, horse manure.

Horses have far more uses than just vanity (and after the first couple
weeks, being seen on a horse was "ho hum", so even that accusation
holds no water now).  They can have my bridle when they pry it
from my cold, dead gauntlets.

That's not *quite* the adjective I had in mind...

So...  I take it you turn down every rez offerred to you when
you die 9 times on a single raid?

If no, then stop speaking nonsense.  If yes, then the original
adjective I had in mind applies triple.


>New Weapons

For the challenge.  "Because it's there".  "We choose to do
these things [...] not because they are easy, but because they
are hard."

Several of your complaints were based on things being allegedly
"too easy" now, why do you then turn around and fail to
understand that epics being hard is one of the best reasons
to quest them?
