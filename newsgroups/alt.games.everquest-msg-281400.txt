There are eight categories of Shroud: 

Aberrations	5 available
Animals		4      ,,	
Elementals	4      ,,
Goblinoid	5      ,,
Humanoid	4      ,,
Nature Spirits	5      ,,
Reptiles		3      ,,
Undead		4      ,,

Each category has the first Shroud already unlocked, ready to use, and
others that you can gradually unlock by earning xp in the first one.

If you have a 55 character you can play a lvl 5 Shroud if you want, or
a lvl 55 Shroud - the Shroud levels start at lvl 5 and go up in
5-level increments.  It's up to you what you want to play, so as a lvl
25 character you can use a Shroud in lvl 5, 10, 15, 20 or 25 mode.
The lvl 25 character will not get a higher level form of the unlocked
shrouds to use until he/she dings lvl 30.

> Secondly how does the /claim gargoyle fit into this progression?

The Gargoyle is just another Shroud form, albeit it a special freebie.
You can play it from lvl 5 just like the other Shrouds.  This one is
on its own - there is no other variant of this freebie Shroud from the
Gargoyle NPC to unlock.  (It says something like "unlocked 1/1" and
other Shrouds state "unlocked 1/4" or something akin) There IS another
Gargoyle Shroud available from the other Shroud NPC's though, which
must differ from this one, because I noticed the Freebie Gargoyle
Shroud doesn't have the Gore attack, but the normal Gargoyle Shroud
does.

Check out http://eq.crgaming.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=9562 to see
what's available in the Shroud forms at various levels.

Check out http://applets.crgaming.com/missions/main.htm for some info
on Shroud Missions - the one that starts in West Commons is not there
at the moment, because it is being revamped - Sony said it was too
easy, lol

Going back to my original post, I used my beastlord, summoned a pet,
buffed it, gave it one pet toy and left another on in my backpack.  I
changed to shroud form and camped for an hour.  Logging back in, I
removed the shroud, and the pet reappeared, still buffed but, since
the pet toy had vanished from my inventory, I assume his had too. This
is what I thought would happen, but I just had to try it  :D
