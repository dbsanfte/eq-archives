Pity, you might learn something. 

Here's a hint for you, free of charge - kiting at high 20s is suckass
experience (for druids at least). Get a group, learn some group
skills, so you won't be completely useless when its time to get some
equipment you can't solo for. Avoid ill omen, it doesn't teach
anything. Try for highkeep if its not gruesomely overcamped (and NOT
Fenn).

Someone kiting for any reason at L28 in EF is someone who needs a kick
in the pants. You'd get better money just from regular drops in lots
of other zones. You'd get better exp in any group. And EF's population
of mammoths is low enough to put EF near last on the places to be at
that level. Finally you yourself are unable to control a pull well
enough to prevent it from being stolen, a no no in a populated area
like EF.

Feel free to ignore that too. I'll still read your messages... when
you're L30 tops with 100pp to your name in a month or so.
