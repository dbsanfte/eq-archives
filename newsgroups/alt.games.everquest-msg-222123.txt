Agreed.  Really your equipment depends on your play style too.  Are you MT or
assist?  When I play tank outdoors with my wizard friend I use some different
gear than when I'm assisting in LDON.  (You can buy an *ivory claw necklace*
with extended range IV for dirt cheap in the bazaar.  Really helps when I am
tank.  If I'm backup it has little value and I change to my Amulet of Mummy)
