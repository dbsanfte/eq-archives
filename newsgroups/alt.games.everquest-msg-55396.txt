Won't do any good.  Bards run about 50% faster than the fastest SoW,
and can track.  Might as well just beg for mercy.

Sidenote:  The lastest Test of Tactics (18 on 18 PvP battle) on
Innoruuk was not the success it was hoped.  Basically only two guilds
fielded teams, and my guild had about 10 extra there helping the main
team practice.  Our main team was quickly owned by Legions of Doom,
then the extras decided to give 'em a try.  Discussing it with LoD
afterwards it turned out that that had to 60 SKs with ST gear who were
responsible for killing bards ASAP.  Shadow-stepping when they rushed
me bought me a bit of time, but they soon found me and took me down.
Talking to one of their SKs she said she had me in her sight, ready to
HT and start smacking, and *poof* no bard.  She seemed almost
disappointed.
