Yup, we agree fully on that. :)

Mmm... I don't think age is really much better.  Or a.g.e, for that

Heh, you do much better than I would in a French newsgroup. :)

}Oh... I read the whole thread again and I did not put the right

}I thought you were telling that all French people are as this image

}My first answer would suit to another poster, my own post was not

If that's the worst thing you do all day... you probably deserve an ice
