I didn't think it was a case of being too weak to say what was meant
explicitly.

It all comes down to how Danni wanted his/her comment to be interpreted.
To me it was an implication (not an outright accusation).
An implication is a "you know I know, and I know you know, but we'll agree
to say nothing and leave it at that".
An accusation would be "you are".

All I can say is congrats on a great fishing expedition ;)
