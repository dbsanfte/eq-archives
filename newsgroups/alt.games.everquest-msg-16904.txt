I have a better solution- I own my own domain, so I can create email addy's 
on a whim (since everything going to emptiedout.com goes to me). Anything 
that goes to emptycanofspam@emptiedout.com gets filtered in my mail client 
to go to a SPAM folder, which I periodically clean out. This means that 
when people send me mail there, I do eventually get it.

I also set up addresses when I sign up for stuff online- like sonystation @ 
emptiedout.com for my sonystation membership, etc. This way, I know who's 
selling my address.

I don't notice much spam coming to emptycanofspam@emptiedout.com anymore, 
though. I think the days of usenet spam spiders are over.
