My main goal was originally to find something new to solo, but the more I
looked at other places to hunt the more I realized that what I was actually
looking for was someplace relatively uncamped where a druid could go from 24
to 29/30 soloing.

Was in SK for a while ... good XP and loot, but the constant whining from
spire groups (and sometimes bird groups) was really starting to wear thin.
When I hit Warsliks this afternoon, there were 3 players (including myself)
in the zone.  The silence was wonderful.

The only thing is trying to find someplace safe to med between kills.  I've
taken to porting to Surefall to med, then gating back to the giants.  There
has to be an easier way ... just haven't found it yet.
