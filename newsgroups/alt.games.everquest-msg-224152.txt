I agree.  I went and looked at mine - they were pretty cheap for the
Dam/Delay, AC, HP/Mana.  However they have recommended levels way above
29.  LDoN has introduced a remarkable number of very nice, very cheap
weapons - but hey have recommended levels from 43-55

(Steward Ritual Claws, Ancient Rujarkian Dagger, Lesser Knuckles of
Serenity and the like)

I just don't know what's out there for lower level beast lords anymore.
