Hmm, they said 10 seconds, which is a pittance compared to the
time Luclin added to my Kunark zone loads (from 10-15 seconds
to 1-2 minutes.)  Interestingly enough, my Luclin zone loads,
and old world zone loads aren't more than 30-40 seconds (up
from 10-15).  Haven't been to Velious since SoL came out.
