I know a couple of old friends who used to hunt the sharks there in the mid
to high teens.  I don't know myself if the sharks are blue at that level but
I suspect my friends wouldn't have been hunting them if they hadn't been.
There may be more stuff in the water or in obscure corners that's at that
level.

My troll shadowknight got to the high twenties killing Bait Masterson and a
couple of the other NPCs down there.  That's a slow respawn though, and I
didn't, nor would I, make a camp out of it.  Also, if you want to go to
Erudin at some point, (a minor consideration, I know) killing Bait's not
that good an idea.

I don't think Runnyeye would be good until you're level 9 or so at least.
