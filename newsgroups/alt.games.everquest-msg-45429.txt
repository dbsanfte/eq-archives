Same on my server (The Nameless), at least the few times I've zoned
into Sebilis.  I forgot to go /roleplay once, and a lot of people at
the zone in immediatly asked for ports or TLs.  There were about 20
people looking for groups.

Yeah.  Chardok really encourages you to get your whole party together
outside the gate.  Once gathered there, you should be able to pull and
kill the gate guards and the others.  If your party can't handle them,
it's not going to have a happy time inside Chardok.
