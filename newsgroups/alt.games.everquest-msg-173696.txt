That is what I mean by "Western Style". However, to Palestinians,
there is no difference between combatants and civilians because the
civilians support what the combatants are doing.

In the event Israel does kill a lot of civilians too, though, which
makes the distinction a lot shadier.

You should try to remember the other side might actually want to win,
and are not out there going "kill me kill me!" It might help your
understanding of why people do what they do.
