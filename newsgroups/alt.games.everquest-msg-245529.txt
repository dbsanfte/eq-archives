I think that by "flopped" they are referring to the movies' ability to 
live up to expectations or to simply do justice to the franchise. The 
majority of the latest Star Wars "episodes'" financial success can be 
directly attributed to the loyal following which will pay to see any new 
Star Wars movie often multiple times, merely because it is Star Wars.

The latest installments in the saga were really not that great compared 
to the first three. Though I felt I got my money's worth for the single 
ticket I purchased to see each film, the movies fell far short of their 
potential IMO.
