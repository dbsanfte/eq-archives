Well, I'm sorry I did. I was in a bad mood after being infected with
this trojan. This the first time I've been hit with a virus or the like
since I first went on the internet some time back in 94, but it was a
lulu. 

And when I tried to notify the people where I got it from, their
response were to tell me that I couldn't possibly know what I was
talking about. Hopefully that's just the corporate lawyers talking and
they've gone ahead and cleaned up their act in the background.

I don't like being angry, I'm not a nice person when I am.

In the meantime, the good news is that Zone Alarm worked & kept this
thing from being any worse. The bad news is that Norton Antivirus with
the latest virus signature didn't detect it.

And I finally got around to switching to my new computer. Still got a
lot of stuff to install, don't have D2 or LoD on it yet. Don't even have
Office or any of the programs I use for my other work installed yet.
