This is probably too much spam for you but here goes:

Target Player you want to assist

Button Text=

/g Assisting %t
/assist
/g Let's kill %t

If you have Bob the Warrior targeted and he's smacking an orc centurion this
will look like:

Assisting Bob
Let's Kill an orc centurion

The second Assist goes into effect, your target will change to the mob or
whatever is targeted by your old target, hence the second line working.
Hope that helps.

But in all reality all you need is:

/assist

The rest is just battle spam.  Useful for everyone to know that you know how
to assist, but after the first couple times it doesn't need to be there.
