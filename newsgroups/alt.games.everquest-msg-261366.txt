"Act of futility"... that pretty much describes playing EQ no matter
what you are doing.  Lets face it, none of us who are playing are
discovering a cure for cancer.  We aren't even learning how to swing
swords or cast spells.  We're playing a videogame for hours on end.
Someone sitting at their computer for 21 hours sounds insane to me...
but to my friends who don't play EQ at all, I'm pretty crazy too.
