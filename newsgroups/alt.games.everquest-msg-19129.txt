Up until about a year ago, if you posted anything on the offical EQ
message boards, you were publically identified by your station name.
It finally occured to them that this was a bad idea, and they changed
it so your message board name was your EQ chat name instead of your
station name.

Still, I'm sure there are a lot of people with high level characters
who have not changed their station name.
