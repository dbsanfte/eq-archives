My apologies...I'll read it again.  I think I may have been speaking too
broadly myself when I said "Anything that conceals your identity is
illegal".  Word is everything *sigh*...if I'm going to bring up an issue
that is all about "wording", I should be less haphazard myself.

Alas, I'm back on company time now, though :( so it'll have to
wait until this evening.  *thinks of reading legistlation instead of
playing computer games and feels a little less excited about Friday Night*
See, now, this is why people don't read up on this stuff and don't get
involved...we'd rather be playing computer games.  :b
