It might.  Lag is cause by someone along the line between you and the
servers not keeping up.  Those servers make data transmission priority
judgements.  Perhaps they figured you were low priority because you hadn't
sent anything in the last few seconds.  Constant pinging might help in this
case.  Origin has a reasonably good pinger that you can download for free.
You will just need to find out what ip you need to ping to.
