Hi guys.  Anyone here from the UK that plays Everquest?  Im trying to buy a
copy, and its nearly impossible.  I went to Electronics Boutique, and they
said they no longer carry the game because it wasn't popular.  I tried their
website, the don't carry it.  I tried Dixons, Currys, Amazon.co.uk and a few
other sites.  Best I could find was the Luclin expansion.
