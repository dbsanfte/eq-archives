I dont defend him, entirely, it would just be nice to see proof every once
in a while, people acuse others of things all day long and nobody ever backs
any of it up, and others just blindly follow, my point is, if you decide not
to trust this guy, or decide not to visit his site, base it on the fact that
lies before you. he is a spammer. not on what somebody else tells you to
think.
