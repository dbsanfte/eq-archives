I could see your point if you were talking about lower lvls where KEI
completely removes your downtime.  Before lvl 30 that's how it was with me,
I would cast and cast and cast and I'd barely notice any mana loss at all.
But after lvl 30, when I got new spells that cost a lot of mana, I still
have downtime (not as much of it, and I can still cast more before I have to
sit and med, but it's a factor still).  If you're killing higher lvl mobs
than you normally would (like I do), then there's really no difference
except that you're getting more exp.
