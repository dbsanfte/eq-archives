I've been there and for the most part I agree with Rumbledor (of course he's
off a bit, not having first-hand experience, but that's expected).

The PoJ trials were utter simplicity.  Any guild that broke up over them
either had no real cohesion to begin with or were simply collectively out of
their league and should have been off leveling up instead of trying to jump
into the higher content.

Any guild that cannot handle a little bit of internal stress is doomed to
self destruct anyway.  So for those of you who actually had that problem
(apparently Dennis among others), you should be thanking Sony for just
hastening the inevitable and letting you get on with your gaming secure in
the knowledge of where you were heading and with (or without) who.
