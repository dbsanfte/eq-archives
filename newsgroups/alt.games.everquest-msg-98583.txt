    The Nek Forest has always been a hidden treasure for me, for the awkward
levels of 5-9.  My monk spawned there when the world finally came back up for
me.  It didn't take long for me to notice that things had changed.  There were
Orcs at was formally the halfling camp along the south wall nearest to the
commons zone.  There were calcified, halfling, and leatherfoot skeletons
wandering about.  New types of spiders and snakes to the area also seemed
plentiful.  At first I wondered if there were some sort of GM event going on. 
But the sky wasn't red, and nobody in /ooc or /shout noticed an event if one
were going on.  I think the MoB table for NF has been revamped.  This place
would now make decent hunting to perhaps 11.  And several of the new MoBs carry
no-drop items that they seem to have no shortage of, making me think that there
are new quests added.
    Things seemed normal in both the Commons, for what little time I spent in
them.  Befallen seemed the same as before the patch.  Anyone notice any
seriously different MoBs in any other zones?
