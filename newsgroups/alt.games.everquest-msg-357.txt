You didn't mention how much RAM you had.  I have noticed I need at least 64
megs to have a good play experiance.  Any thing less and it runs pretty
slow.  Your processor is fine, that is what I have.  The vid card could be
better.  I just bought a Riva TNT2 for 80 bucks from Electronics Boutique,
and it is a great card.

What type of net connection do you have.  I have played on a 56k connection
as well as Cable/DSL.  I have noticed the 56k modem is slightly slower.  To
me RAM made more difference then connection speed.  I have seen some people
on this NG play on a 28.8 connection!

All in all you should be ok w/ the set up you have now.  If you have less
than 64 megs of Ram it may run a litty choppy.

BTW Baldur's Gate II runs choppy on my P2400, 256meg RAM, Voodoo3 machine,
while EQ runs a lot better.
