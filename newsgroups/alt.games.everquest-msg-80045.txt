Actually, with the exception of some weird bugs in that zone, (see
below) the entry mobs have a pretty short aggro radius. When we start
our camp there, I pull the first one on the right with an arrow. Direct
melee style attack. And I never get the left side one. I started doing
that at level 52, so I don't think it's a level thing. But oddly, I've
had times when fighting one of the twins (the second pair in from entry)
up by the water that one of the ones from next to the STAIRS will
suddenly come running up and join in. Never figured that one out.

None of the entry mobs can summon, and that goes for them all the way to
the balcony unless you draw one of the really big Rock Golems for the
golem pull down there. In theory they *should* be able to summon, but
I've still never had it happen yet. Don't hit any summoning mobs until
you get into the castle or later.
