Yeah, I'll admit that I do, on occasion, miss the ability to bind where ever I
want, gate, port myself around, and a few of the other nice things about wizzies.
But that is *SO* outweighed by the advantages I find to playing the warrior. Being
able to get into a group quickly and fight/gain xp/loot almost continually (with
nice healers keeping me at full health) is so much better than the endless hours
sitting and fishing while waiting to med back up to where I can root-nuke-nuke-nuke
one more single blue mob.  And when things get out of hand, and something is trying
to seriously open a can of whoopass (tm) on me, it's really nice to have those
nearly a thousand hit points and better than half a grand of AC while taking a
licking and keeping on ticking.
