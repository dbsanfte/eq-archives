At 65, I have soloed in various nonpop zones, going after dark blue mobs 
only.  Droga, Nadox, Torgiran's, OS are all places I have soloed, and 
that are easy to solo in.  I was not impressed with the xp over time 
really.

Until recently, I still soloed dark blues in PoN, which is where I get 1 
to 1.5% AAXP per kill.  I recently discovered that the Crystalline Golems 
in PoV are just as soloable as the PoN yard trash, and yield about 5% 
AAXP per kill.  I have not had any trouble single pulling, and never get 
adds while killing them.  I most definitely do not melee them at all, and 
I don't use my pup.  I did use him on my first golem, but I was fighting 
in tight quarters that time, and even so, ended up having to let him die 
due to being lom, when the mob was down to about 8% health.  My pup had 
the mage haste mask, hp belt, and a pair of the proccing +hp weapons.  
Since then, I have gone back several times, and just used root and rot to 
kill them.  Kill speed is not very high, will have to time it to get an 
idea how long it will take to get one AA level.

I have been told of a couple of spots in HoH, but, like you, I have yet 
to see a good way to reliably single pull there.
