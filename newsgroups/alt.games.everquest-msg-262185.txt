The subject was Jeb Bush, and it was the Florida Supreme Court.  It was 
in the news, recently, Schiavo.  Jeb Bush, and relatives of the woman in 
question were not happy with the court decision, and had a law pushed 
through that would allow Jeb to order a feeding tube reinsterted.  The 
Florida Supreme Court overturned said law because, in their words:

"It is without question an invasion of the authority of the judicial 
branch for the Legislature to pass a law that allows the executive branch 
to interfere with the final judicial determination in a case,"
