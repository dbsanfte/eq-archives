To an extent.  I get almost all anime names out there.  I see nothing wrong
with taking the name Cephiro (from Magic Knights Rayearth), or Reki (from
Haibane Renmei, and incidently my no object d'worship.  All hail the bestest
character in all of anime).  Even my own characters are relatively obscure:
Tenjou, Utena's family name from Revolutionary Girl Utena; Miyazawa, from
His and Her Circumstances; and Precia from Rayearth.  Any anime fan would
recongnize at least the last one, and often all three.  OTOH, you can't look
at them and accuse me of having a bandwagon mentality.  Now, if I were to
take a name like Goku from DragonBall, or Pikachu from Pokemon, that would
be a flagrent foul.  Yes, they're anime, but they're mainstream.

Simply recognizing an name should not be a failure of the obscurity rule.
There's a difference between an inside joke or homage, and over ripoffs.

Now, another side to the question would be what to do about names that were
obscure before, but not now?  What if I chose the name Eboshi from Mononoke
Hime back when I first watched it (subtitled in Mandrin, helluva lot of good
that did me)?  At the time, Miyazaki's works were unknown, now they aren't
well know, but they're not just for otaku anymore... So, is that a
violation?
