Hmm. I haven't noticed this. When I turn tail, I normally try to 
strategically time my jumps and my "angle stepping" to try an stay ahead of 
the mob. I've not noticed a reduced need for that, say one or two hops 
putting me ahead for good. I guess it's usually such a desperate situation 
that I don't care to find out. :P
