This is the same company that, for the last week on Seventh Hammer at least,
has had a 'message of the day' warning people to be careful who they hand
stuff to because 'we consider all trades to be final'.  The same company who
refuse to help the poor mug who drops something when some sneaky toe-rag
runs off with it because "if it's on the floor, anyone's allowed to pick it
up" (this has happened to a couple of people I know).

Like you say, if corpses shouldn't be looted by everyone, then don't make
everyone able to loot them.  Simple.

Ignore the GM.  You were in the right.
