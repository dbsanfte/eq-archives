Hi devil,

Thanks a lot for the suggestion, I had thought about this and that is one of
the reason i write here anonymously (ramirez boomblast), I dont want another
ill intentioned person to jump on the chance to create a char by seeing
their names here, I had my share of stupid moves this week end. :-))

My names are all invented names, not taken from books or movies, and not
real firstname so I have good hopes.

I just sent a mail to customer service and will contact them on their chat
service tomorrow anyway.

Once again, thanks for the help guys, it is appreciated beyond all you can
imagine :-)))
