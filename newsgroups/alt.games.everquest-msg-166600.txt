So, if I don't have the Luclin expansion, I might have a hard time finding
places to trade, buy, & sell?  I'm also concerned about starting a character
from scratch.  Are there still a lot of players with low level characters
hanging out in the newbie areas?  Also, is it harder to find groups in the
lower level areas now because everybody has relatively high level
characters?  I'm trying to to determine whether or not I should resume
Everquest or wait for either EQ2 or Star Wars Galaxies.

Thanks again...
