It wont seem like too terribly much if you are standing, but it also depends
on your level as that line of spells gets constantly upgraded, breeze is at
16, clarity at 29 I think, C2 at 56? KEI at 60. So if I am 60 and I get
breeze popped on me I wont notice...
If you are a super twink and have a gigantic mana pool for your level that
makes a difference too as your mana bar will always look empty.
