Take these three pieces of advice
1. /ignore stupid druid
If he's dumb enough to harrass you afterwards by training or something
(would affect your gameplay) /petition immediatly as ongoing interference
with your gameplay after you ignored him, and a gm or guide will likely show
up after a while gm-invis, and punt him for a week when they see him train
you.

2. If you really want to experience the 'thrill of pvp', go to a server whos
name ends in Zek. On a non-pvp server you will probably find a dozen active
accounts with pvp characters, and 8 of them are bazaar mules that turned in
their books so their names would stand out in a crowd. On a non-pvp server,
you are asking to solo the rest of your life for turning in your book. Mind
you, I know a druid that did it. This way, no he won't f'n sow you cause he
can't. No he doesn't want to join your group. Go away, he's quad kiting.

3. If you are attached to playing that character, /petition, and a gm will
give you an unreasonably tough quest to do (since as a red you can't count
on any support), and log it in the csr ticket database. One you are done
with quest, /petition again and they will flip you back blue.
