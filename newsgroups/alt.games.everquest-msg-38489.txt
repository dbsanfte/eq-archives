I do believe the results of your experiment, and in fact I never even
questioned it.  Also I am not the one that mentioned base agi as being 75, I
thought it was 70, but that is irrelevant to the point I am making.  You
have said more than once (as quoted above) that being low on health or being
encumbered affect BOTH agility and running speed.  This leads to the logical
assumption that the two (agi and running speed) are connected.  As one goes
down, so does the other.  You have said as much yourself.  :-)
