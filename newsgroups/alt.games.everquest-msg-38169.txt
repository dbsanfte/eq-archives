You don't need good Indigo Brotherhood faction to buy/bank in Neriak.

My dwarf Paladin has unredeemably bad faction with the Indigo Brotherhood,
but can still safely walk in most parts of Neriak and buy/sell/bank
with no problem.

He just can't go waltzing into the Warrior's guild...

There aren't many drawbacks to hosing your Indigo Brotherhood
faction (unless you *are* a Dark Elf Warrior).
