If Pacify pulling is a good thing, then how can enchanters be out
of a job?  Admittedly it does put them in a four class category:
Paladin, Bard, Cleric, Enchanter. 

You gloss over hastes as though they are a trivial matter, but in
most groups its melee that does the bulk of the damage, and that
means the better your haste the better your group.  Chanter haste
is "best in show", and if you have a bard (mid 50s or better that
is) so much the better, bard normal haste sucks but stack their
special "bard haste" with chanter haste and it doesn't get any
better if you aren't a pet. 

Enchanter is also a DPS class, of course, the same way a bard
is... usually mobs outdamage PC's by a good amount, and
enchanters are just so very charming that mobs are lining up to
do the work for them assuming they aren't busy mezzing.
