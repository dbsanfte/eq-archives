Don't know about Cazic, went there last night just to see if my 25 druid
could pick up some items for my mage. Those lizards are tough.  I was 50%
mana and got into a fight with a green conning guard and I had to run to
zone with my tail between my legs.  I went OOM with nukes and I couldn't
melee him, they have nasty regen on them!  I was watching a 26-27 warrior
melee a greenie and was wondering what was taking so long, now I know!
Don't think I will go there again real soon.
