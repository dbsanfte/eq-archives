Yes this is a terrible way to make money, but I still make all my characters
master the baking skill because of it.  It is nice to have when you need
that extra 50 plat to buy an item that you really want are just short of the
money for.  It has also popped up more recently because of people selling
Plat Guides which all use this as their methodology.  I imagine that Verant
will eventually remove this as a feature (I hope not though) if it becomes
too widespread in use and changes the economy too greatly.
