Bards are fairly crappy soloer's at early levels and very dependant on
low lag, I constantly find I'm running rings round 2-3 mobs (which is
all I dare to kite if I want to level up rather than down) when *BANG*
one of the mobs, which I KNOW was not in reach of me has stunned me
stupid and I'm getting whacked on by all 3 until I recover from stun
again, and to preempt the 'you're just crap' callls, no its not me,
it's lag.

At later levels they ROCK.

my bard is level 32. and just getting OKish at soloing.
