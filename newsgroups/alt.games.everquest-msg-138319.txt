...I just can't leave my trader down for long enough to actually go out and
use all my new shiney toys. Time is platinum - I may have made a nice profit
during that last 2 hour xp session, I have no patience for levelling anymore
: |

Buy very low - sell just a bit higher. Lotsa turnover of small profits, the
plat has been steadily but surely trickling in but just like a leaky tap it
still fills the  bathtub over time...

The new toys have been great though - I would never have dreamed previous of
being able to afford things like Silver Chitin Handwraps for my alts - and
now 2 of them have them. Prices have gone down as everyone is selling now -
not just the greedy proffessional traders with their +100% markups.

All my mellee alt's now have their very own set of velium fire wedding
rings, so I don't have to do drop offs every time I want to switch alts. My
Shadowknight has fared well, all his Blackened Alloy gear has been replaced
with Sentinent and Crusty gear. He now has a Mace of the Shadowed Soul too
so doesn't have to rely on 2HS all the time because his one handed weapons
stank. He is level 27 so can catch up on 1hb still but this is the first
character I have had with HP over 1000 without buffing ; )

My baby magician (13) now has an earing of everfount, hoop of the
magi-knot,rod of oblation, Elemental Binder and a Shardstooth Flayed Skin.
That's on top of  Ring of the Frost Spiders and a Moonstone Ring. All of his
standard cloth armour has being replaced with hp and mana items mostly but
his Int is a respectable 188 already.

Next on the the upgrade list is my baby beastlord...... hmmn, only trouble
is it's been over a week since I actually *played* EQ.... Still, I have been
having a shite load of fun.

BTW - you really learn to love your broadband connection once you start
trading. It's actually exciting to be going home after a days work to see
how much has sold during the last 10 hours : )
