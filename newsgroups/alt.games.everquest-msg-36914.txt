Runnyeye.  SolA.  Both zones are still farmed on occasion (hell, I farm SolA
when bored and no level-appropriate folks are there).

Does it help the level-appropriate people?  Dunno, but the original poster
said it was a Bad Idea, though beyond your rewording ("a solution for a
problem that doesn't exist") I don't see much point in debating the topic.
So they added code that doesn't hurt anything...who cares?

All it does is piss off the high level players that won't be able to loot
the latest newbie ph4t l3wt in Luclin.  Golly, that's a damned shame.  I
think that Verant NEEDS to piss off the high level characters on
occasion...many of them take themselves wayyy too seriously.  Knock 'em down
a few pegs...like high level characters are somehow more IMPORTANT than low
level.  Like high level characters are somehow SMARTER (there are so many
really DUMBASS 55+s out there...I mean, CRUSHBONE dumb, and I'm not talking
about sold accounts) or BETTER LOOKING than low level characters.  Screw
'em.  Do something to piss 'em off on occasion...it's not like the low level
zones are in any way, shape or form the business of high level characters
anyway.

Luclin low level zones will give NEW players a chance to discover something
not yet discovered on their server.  Eh, of course, not all that likely,
since most of us have low-mid level twinks (myself included) but still
possible.
