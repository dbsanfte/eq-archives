I've got two P4s with XP and they both get disconnected a lot more than they
used to before two or three weeks ago.  I'm guessing it's an XP patch more
than an EQ patch that's causing the problem.

The second computer is usually where my mule is run from and lately, it gets
disconnected and crashes during the reconnect process.  I end up using the
task manager to get out and it shows eqgame using 100% of the cpu before I
kill it.  Also a problem from the last couple of weeks.
