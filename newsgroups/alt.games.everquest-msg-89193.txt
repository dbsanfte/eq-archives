This is the interdependance of the classes in EQ. One character class's
weakness is another's strength. This does encourage grouping and teamwork.
Also, there are several classes that can solo quite easily if you choose.

I don't play AC but I would assume this kind of a thing would lead all
the power gamers to make the uber characters with the 'best' abilities
and most people end up cookie-cutters of each other. I am a min-maxer
myself and I know I would do that.

EQ has that now with the Luclin expansion. Only thing that pisses me
off is that I can't change the color of the eyebrows of my gnome. They
are always white which looks stupid with any other hair color. =)

In EQ you can raise attributes with equipment and at the later levels
with the Alternate advancement system of Luclin.

EQ has spells and items to run faster as well as the run speed alternate
advancement for the higher levels.

This all depends on the items and your class. For instance druids don't get much
of a different look because all they can wear is leather and for some reason
much of the leather looks the same in EQ. However, if you are a warrior you
get tons of choices for armor and weapon looks.

Personally for me I don't care what my character looks like. All I care about
are the stats of the armor items and weapons. I'd much rather be alive and
wearing clown pants then be dead and look good. The play is the thing for me
not the look.

Hardly. If you join a decent guild that has porters this is not a problem or
if you play a porting class yourself or if you just spend a little cash to buy
a port. Also, the Luclin expansion added the Nexus which has ports to all
the main continents. A 3 hour run would be extreme.

Hardly. Depends on what your hardware can handle and you can adjust
the clip plane. I have my clip plane all the way out in most zones and you
can see a lot farther than 200 feet.

EQ has Day and night, snow and rain effects with fog. Colored lighting,
abient sounds. If you have 4 speakers with a decent sound card the sound
in this game is full 3d.

I find the outside camera views in EQ to be very usefull. You can change the camera
angle and distance in every view. EQ has 1st person, overhead, rear chase
and 2 floating camera views.

EQ has the sense heading skill and you can also buy a compass.
Tracking is not really a radar but a way to lead you to specifics mobs.

Now this is a huge plus for AC. I WISH EQ had that! I can always hope
they will add it in a future expansion. They have added a ton of new features
that make the game much more enjoyable and easier to play. There
is a new interface up grade planned that I can't wait to use.

EQ has the /loc command which gives you your map co-ordinates and if
you need to find your corpse you can find it with the help of a bard, shadow
knight, Necro or a chipped bone rod that you can buy.

This is mostly true. But there are events like the Halloween weekend where
several zones underwent radical changes for a short period. Also, more quests
are added with every expansion, and Verant has added several free zones
like the Warrens and Stonebrunt.

This is only true for some EQ trades skills. Several trade skills in EQ are very
hard to raise, find components for, or are very expensive. But this makes
it all the more rewarding to master them.

Some EQ monsters will break off pursuit if you get far enough ahead of them.
Also, you can zone to escape from them.

Depending on what changes have been made EQ has had some big
patches come down the line.

This is entirely untrue. I have occasional lag in EQ but that is mostly due to
ISP problems and router isssues. Most of my play in 95% lag free. Like
everything else with internet its hit and miss depending on your connection
and your ISP.

EQ has dedicated PK servers and rulesets. You can duel on the regular
servers but its only by choice. You can go pk on a regeular server if
you want but don't do it, its a stupid idea. Play on the dedicated servers
if you want to PK.

EQ does have swimming and several underwater adventure areas.
I find that I don't like the swimming much in EQ though, its a pain to
maneuver sometimes but it gets easier with practice.


The main things I like about EQ:

1. The game is hard. EQ is without a doubt the hardest game I have
ever played. It requires thinking and tactics to do battle. There is danger
everywhere, and it requires you to always be on your toes. This is a good
thing for me as I am easily bored by games that are too easy or allow
you to save every minute and that have 'cheat codes.'

2. The EQ world is damn HUGE and its getting bigger all the time. I have
been playing for 3 years now and I STILL have not seen everything. There
are lots of places to play, things to hunt, items to acquire, quests to do, and
trades skills to master.

3. A good character progression system. CRPGs are all about progress.
You progress from a level one whimp that has to run from a rat, to a powerful
hero that defeats Giants and Dragons! EQ has spells and abilities to gain
as you level and tons of equipment to acquire and collect. There is always
something new to go after.
