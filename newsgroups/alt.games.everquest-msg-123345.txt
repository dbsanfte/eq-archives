More HP (focus)
Mana regen + HP (Potg)

I bet your 59 cleric has more mana than my 60 cleric (yours is a main
actively played character) and BAOR costs me almost *nothing* to cast....
its no different to SoW - its just an inconvenience - no big deal.

On the contray though, group focus (which is the only time I'd focus a
cleric) takes about half my shamans mana.. compare that to your 0.0004 of a
blue to cast BAOR :)
