Maybe you can explain how to enable Red/Blue 3D mode?  Not everyone
reads the manual and in some cases the manual don't come with the card
at all.

I would have prefered the LCD glasses for full colors and even better
3D effect. (LCD glasses are loke shutter running in synch with the
monitor so your eye sees one view while your other sys sees other
view.)  I have a vintage Segascope 3D glasses that still work if a way
was made to interface that to the PC =)
