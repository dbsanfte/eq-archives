Well most of the replies tend to say that words to the effect "Wait to u are
higher level and feel the pain of long corpse runs". Well maybe. But I enjoy
the flavour of Everquest as a fantasy world. The day it (if ever) transforms
into purely a mechanical game where dieing is only a slight annoyance and
everyone has teleports (thus shrinking the world)...will be a sad day
indeed.

I just like hte idea of sweating over dangerous situations I came across.
Thats why I gave up Diablo2, death (apart from an XP penalty) just didnt
become a risk anymore, no enjoyment in playing.
