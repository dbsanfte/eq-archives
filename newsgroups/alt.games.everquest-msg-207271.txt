    He was first choice when it dropped in Water. Later on, presumably on
another raid given the rate at which plate drops, he may not have still been
first choice (attendance, appropriateness of the given plate drop to his
class, etc). Most people doing officer reward would have given him the item
anyways, just to smooth things over and prevent what ultimately happened,
but some stick to whatever system they have to decide who gets what.

    Just to clarify what I said about appropriateness - note that Monual
doesn't say what type of plate item dropped the second time. The focus
effects vary from slot to slot, and make a big difference as to who "should"
get it first. For example, say that plate boots were the next plate drop. If
the paladin got them, they would have become Trydan's Boots of Nobility, an
incredible item with 15% mana preservation and +ATK/regen. But if those same
boots had been given to a cleric, they would have been 15% mana preservation
boots - on a cleric. Clerics keep you alive, and maximal mana preservation
on them is crucial. So as a raid leader, I'd lean towards giving boots to a
cleric over a paladin. Just as I'd lean towards giving the hat (See
Invis/Ultravision/Enduring Breath as the effect) to Humans, Barbarians, and
Erudites first, then to tanks over clerics.

    There's underlying ill will with almost every loot decision. You really
need to be a loot officer to appreciate exactly how petty and moronic people
can be when ultimate_item46 goes to someone other than themselves. Example:
I was cleric in pull group. This item drops:

Band of Swirling Air, Magic Lore No Drop, Finger slot, AC 9 DEX 30 STA 15
AGI 30 HP 135 MANA 145 DR/PR 20 effect: 41% haste, all/all, weight 0.6

    So every melee there without a 100+ HP haste item is sending a tell,
this is going to be an incredibly contested drop. The item is awarded after
about 15-20 minutes deliberation. A monk in pull group starts to go nuts
about how he'll never replace his cruddy haste item, the system sucks,
clearly officers hate him, etc. Not terribly remarkable, until you consider
two things:

(1) This monk had just recently taken close to three weeks off to level up a
shaman, and had nearly switched mains. So he had cruddy attendance.
(2) Our guild leader was also in the pull group. He was throwing this hissy
fit right in front of him.
