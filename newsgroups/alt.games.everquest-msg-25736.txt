In Kael, once you kill Derakor the Vindicator (puts out a lot of
damage through raw melee but isn't really hard for most uberguilds)
you have a nice open path to the Statue of Rallos Zek. The statue is
easier than Derakor, it just has fifteen bazillion hp. It doesn't even
always quad attack (or didn't).

Once the statue dies, though... immediately the Avatar of War spawns.
And it is a whole nother ball of wax.
