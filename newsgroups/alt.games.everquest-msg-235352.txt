Basically they can't be grouped or the lowbie will get no xp at all.

Since they can't be grouped the lowbie has to do either 50%+ of the
damage or be the only char on the mob hatelist when it dies.

SKs are lousy PL characters since they lack buffs and heals and regens
etc which make it easier and faster to do that 50% damage.

I *think* you'll be able to kill 95%+ with your SK, snare, fear and
then feign death and finish the mob off with the druid; that's about
the only 'trick' you really might be able to use. And that only works
while FD wipes the hate list (or wait 2 minutes each time... anyone
know if you get a message for that now??)... otherwise you'll have to
zone.

Your 'pet' is irrelevant... its part of your character as far as xp is
concerned. You can use it, but there are no 'special' rules about pets
or pet levels in this regard.

It might be worth it to skip "power levelling" and 2 box two lowbie
chars up if you have any interest in having another character. Good
utility characters like enchanters (who could eventually kei your
druid), or a ranger ... nothing like 'real track' etc are nice to
have....

Druids are good solo classes so they pair well with pretty much
anything else you might want to have.

Other than that: basic 2 boxxing advice....

If you group don't keep the fact that you are two boxing a secret
they'll figure it out; most don't mind grouping with an upfront
2-boxer... but nobody likes being deceived
