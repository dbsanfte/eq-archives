what im not sure of though, is I had just gotten a new hard drive and when I
setup the news account I put the posting name asn Brian- , as defualt by my
email name too, and  I hadnt changed my name over,  would I have been flamed
being a known poster, or was it just flame the thought to be newbie poster?
I know when i 1st started to post i was genrally flamed once a week, but
since ie been posting for awhile it rarely happens *shrug* .
