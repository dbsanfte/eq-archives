No idea, its one of those things I wish I'd written down since I
started playing right when it went retail. I have no idea if the years
have honestly been kept track of since then or if its just a random
year that starts each time the server is put back up.

I'll write down the year in EQ when the server goes down for patch
next time, then write down the year when its up again and see if it
really is keeping track.
