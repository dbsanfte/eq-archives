Hmms actually your setup would be better then AB.  BST don't come into their
own till 50+, I'm a little biased since my main is a 64 bst who get's passed
on by groups that say "sorry we really need a dps class".  Once you go with
a 64/65 Paragon enabled BST though, few classes will hesitate to look for
them when they are making up groups, it's just frustrating trying to open
peoples eyes
