I asked a similar question not too long ago regarding the
buying/selling of plat, and got an answer that made a lot of sense.
When anything is created/developed/looted in-game for the sole purpose
of selling it out-of-game, mass camping and farming results, creating
more obstacles between the typical player and level-appropriate
equipment. This is, IMHO, one of the worst aspects of the game.
