No, but his point is that Bill Gates didn't have so much foresight and 
imagination as boundless greed and low cunning.

His only true innovation was the idea of charging money for what people had 
been freely sharing up to that point. On the other hand, money is what has 
been keeping the industry moving as fast as it has, so maybe it was a good 
thing. But he's far from a visionary, and to realize this all one needs to 
do is to spend some time with a machine other than a Windows PC.

It breaks my heart that out of machines like Amigas, SGIs, Sun 
SparcStations, BeBoxes, Macs, or even PCs running other operating systems, 
the very, very worst of the bunch had to go on to become the standard.
