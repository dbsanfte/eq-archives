I found this out too.  A few months ago, I got involved with a guild
that decided to "start from scratch" and use nothing that we did not
loot ourselves.  So, I went through the new tutorial and did the new
PoK newbie quests.  At the same time, I did some really hard looking
around for reasonably attainable gear at low levels.  I came up with
three conclusions:

1. The Iksar Berserker Club (7/18 + buff proc) from Kurn's is grossly
overpowered, relative to everything else at that stage of the game.
2. The best weapons available in the new tutorial (e.g. 8/28 club, 9/27
sword) could not reasonably be replaced until at least level 25 or so
(10/25 spear from named bogling in Echo).  The exceptions to this were
the IBC and the 9/24 iksar BST progressive HtH weapon, both attainable
late-teens.
3. More generally, looting better gear than the newbie armor was really
hard, at least into the late-20's.

Sadly, the guild folded, and I confess I went on to other things.

What I find interesting is that everything I read about the high-end
game makes it out to be exactly what you want, Xiphos.  You just can't
get better gear from the bazaar, after a certain point, and you have to
loot the No Drop items yourself.  Sadly, my highest level character, at
60, still hadn't reached that stage, and bazaar purchases are still a
viable upgrade path for that character.  I would be curious to discover
whether any of the people advocating "use only what you loot" had ever
reached that stage of the game - I might suppose they haven't.

I have also spent some time on the "dark side" playing WoW.  In that
game, there are numerous quest rewards.  My highest level character in
WoW, at level 30, has earned more than half of his gear from one quest
or another (his weapon was purchased from another player; a few items
were tradeskilled).  In addition, every single monster seems to have a
low chance of dropping a spiffy item (no one explains why that tiger
was carrying a pair of magical chainmail boots, but...).  So, while
killing level 25 monsters, you might randomly loot an upgrade to a
random slot, usable by anyone, say, level 18 or higher.  Now, WoW does
have an analog to the bazaar, and there is a brisk economy in trading
drops that you don't need for money.  Nevertheless, it is very possible
to loot/quest regular gear upgrades, without spending hours on end
delving into spoiler sites to uncover some hidden quest/drop, and it is
possible to perform quite well in such gear.  If you want to sell your
dropped magical gear, you'll find that selling drops amounts to a very
significant fraction of the wealth you acquire.  Drops can be had early
too - I had a level 12 character loot randomly dropped gear that would
be sell-able to a level 5.  Finally, in EQ-speak, most quest rewards
are No Drop and most dropped gear is tradable, but Attunable (i.e.
becomes No Drop once put on).  This prevents the EQ problem of the
first FBSS looted in 1999 still being passed around, along with the
thousand other copies looted on the server since then.

Anyway, this is not meant as a commercial for WoW.  However, it does
graphically demonstrate how much modern EQ does not play that way, at
least at most of the lower levels, for most people.  There are lots of
places to grind out experience, but it takes more work and/or knowledge
to find someplace to loot an upgrade.  Generally, the piece you want
drops from one mob in one specific location.  If you just blithely set
up camp anywhere that looks good and kill things, you probably won't
get anything you'd use.  In addition, high level characters can loot
plenty of items that even a level 5 would find as a usable upgrade over
cloth armor.  Perhaps part of the problem is the abundance of
usable-at-level-10 gear dropped by mobs over level 40.

There are two ways to look at it.  Low level upgrades just aren't very
available to lowbies, without targeted hunting.  Or, low levels are
conditioned to gear that is "too good".  While the second may well be
true in this day and age, I think there is a case to be made for the
first, independently of that.  Or, perhaps I'm just off my rocker. :)
