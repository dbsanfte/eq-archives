> What would be the best (1h or 2h) weapon for my level of character

  I'm assuming there's not a lot of platinum in your budget at this
point, so you may just be lucky to use whatever you can.  Two 1HS
weapons you're likely to be able to get your hands on are a minotaur
battle axe (which drop fairly commonly off minotaurs in the minotaur
caves in the Steamfont mountains, not far from Greater Faydark) or a
dwarven axe (which drops off a higher level orc in Crushbone).  The
dwarven axe is the superior weapon, but either would be adequate at
your level.  Except to pay 8-10 platinum for either of them.

  2HS... I suppose whatever you can get your hands on that's better
than a rusty weapon.  Fine steel twohander, bone bladed claymore,
shiny brass halberd, axe of the iron back, giant tree flayer... you
may have to wait a while before you can get your hands on any of
these, or hope somebody is feeling generous enough to give one to you.
The fine steel twohander or tree flayer you might be able to find
selling for 15pp or so, though they for almost that much to vendors so
it'll be a matter of luck.

> I am working on both 1+2handed so as not to "handicap" myself
later??

  A good idea.  It's also not a poor idea to try to keep up your 1HB,
2HB and piercing skill, too.  Don't worry about it too much, though.
You can play catch-up later, all you have to do is find a group that
is pulling a steady stream of mobs that con light blue or better to
you and ask them if you can practice your weapon skill against them.
You don't have to join the group, so you won't be taking a cut of the
experience, but you will be doing a little damage for them.  They get
free damage, you get free skillups, everyone benefits.

  Faydwer, and Greater Faydark in general, is not one of my favorite
areas, but it is the area where I personally started my first
characters.  Crushbone can be some fun at lower levels, but you may
want to try making the crossing to Antonica.  There are orc camps in
the East Commonlands.  The experience isn't a whole lot better, but
there is a better shot at making some money.  You can kill bears in
hopes of getting a high quality bear skin (generally sells for 20pp+)
and Deathfist slashed belts off of orcs which I've been able to sell
in the past for about 1pp each to other players.

  Good luck. :)
