True, if you just blindly wander then you get gacked, but if you learn

For non-twinks the loot in both the warrens and SBM is great.
My druid pulled in well over 200pp going from 24 to 26, AND got xp fast
AND had almost zero risk of dieing.

I have not hunted the names in the warrens yet, mainly cause I am always

I have not killed many cats, but I think you are right.

Hunting with my Necro in the warrens (pain side) I have seen many many
trains, but most are anounced and easy (ish) to dodge.

With my Druid in SBM I have not been hit by one train in 2 levels.
But then I have been camping the safe kobolds in the SW.

The zone is HUGE I doubt that I have seen a tenth of it yet.

I like the look of the heretic quest, but have not been able to get on
and try it :-(

Since my last post about SBM was OT on the thread that it was in, and
got swallowed by international events I'm going to copy it in here as it
says a lot of what I think about SBM and my hopes future of it.

From here on I am quoting dstep, who I hope will forgive me for both
re-quoting him and for ratteling his cage <G>

 This is possibly the most negitive speculation I have ever heard.
 I can think of a few reasons that there will be people in SBM in 2
 months time, even in 20 months time.

 Firstly there are some nice quests. The all/all haste belt is something
 that I am going to go after and the high level "Titan sample (good)"
 quests prity much ensure that the Titans will be camped 24*7. I agree
 that some of the quests neeed to be cleaned up a bit, but there is some
 good stuff there.

 Secondly the camps in the SW corner have to be the best place I have
 ever seen to go from 20 to 25 anywhere. Constant easy blue pulls that
 let you grind xp like anything. Power levelers will use this area even
 if no-one else does. I plan to use it with any char that I want to get
 through those levels.

 Thirdly, well see below ...

 I agree that currently the location of SBM (and to a lesser extent the
 warrens) is a problem. More on this.

 Humm. Very cruddy drops ? I don't think that my Necro would agree with
 you. I'm level 10 and have 100pp in the bank. Seems like that is more
 than I ever got in Crush, runney eye, black burrow or where ever. Ok if
 your main is level 60 with 50000pp in the bank this makes no
difference,
 but to me having a char able to equip them selves is nice.

 In SBM my druid did levels 24-26 as an xp grind. I *still* made over
 250pp in 2 levels.

 Sorry don't know about kerra so can't comment.

 How many low level dungeons have constant high numbers of people ?
 Crushbone. (Which is surrounded by 3 start points (4 if you count
 gnomes))
 Any others ?
 My necro has hunted in the warrens a lot. It is never crowded, but
there
 are almost always peopel there, and since I play in UK time (i.e. off
 peak) this seems to me like people still go there. I have been on when
 there have been under 800 on the server and there have been 10 people
in
 the warrens. Ok so it is not as many as Crush or EC but that is a fair
 show for a low level dungeon.

 I agree that not much has changed in the old world.
 Not much has needed to, the new world has filled the gaps.

 However SBM has at least 2 obvious zone points (The tunnel in the town
 and a zone entrance on the east wall). There may be more these are just
 what I have seen in my limited travels there. SBM also has a large cat
 population.

 I hear that later this year there is an expansion comming out. Round
 about christmas time I think. I hear that there will be cat people in
 it, and that there will be a walk through link to the existing world. I
 wonder where VI could put that link.

 Lets see it would have to be in a zone developed after they started on
 the expasion.
 It would need to form a contextual bridge between the existing areas
and
 the new cat infested zones.
 It would need to have some spaces for the zone lines.

 Humm, perhaps SBM could become a trunk route to the new world ?
 That could keep the population up a bit.

 I agree with you that travel there could be easier, but it is not
really
 that hard. I agree that there should be a non-caster bind point in SBM,
 and probably a bank too. I agree that these will cause there to be less
 people there than there are in LOIO. (But that ain't such a bad thing)
I
 am starting to agree that TLC is pointless, but on the other hand it is
 not a great hardship either.

 I just wish that people could think a little more before bashing VI.
 They do actually want to keep us happy.
 It is how they make their money.
 Call it enlightened self interest.
 Surely a *FREE* new zone is cause for celebration even if no one ever
 uses it.

 Just my rant,
 No I don't kiss VI arses,

 Jim
