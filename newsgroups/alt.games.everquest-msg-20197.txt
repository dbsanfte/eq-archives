I have no disagreement with that :-)

What I am saying is that spending your *starting* points in to agility is a waste
for a paladin. Much better would be to put those point in to strength and wisdom
(the principle attributes for a holy knight) and possibly stamina (because decent
stamina enhancements are rare.) Agility is a pretty easy attribute to up, especially
by 20th level.
