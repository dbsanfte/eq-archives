Hmm.  How about if they made you rezzable from either end?  That way an 
un-sol ro flagged cleric could target naked me in pok and zap me back to 
my corpse inside sol ro... Naw, that'd make raid CR way too easy I bet.

}> work.
}Interesting. But problematic.

Could do it by extending what they did when they added level flags.  Do 
the raid, your entire account is flagged, but only the characters who do 
the actual raid get the free AA and charm upgrade from the dwarf.

Of course, then my level 25 beastlord would be elemental...

}> The expansion I liked the best was LDON . Try to figure out what you did
}> right with that one and do it again. I liked POP as well.

Add me to the "LDoN is teh suck" camp, please.  Yes.  I like dungeon 
crawling.  But I like dungeon crawling in zones like Lower Guk and Velk's 
much more than LDoN's same series of repeatedly connected hallways...

Guk LDoN had some vaguely nice bits, but nobody ever wants to do Guk.  But 
even then, it's just an exp grind.  There's never an interesting non-kos 
mob to stumble across, or a drop for a quest.
