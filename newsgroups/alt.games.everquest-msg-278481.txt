But he, and anyone else who wants to sell their account, shouldn't be posting here. The appropriate procedure is to send 
an email to the sony accounts email address, including your name, credit card number, expiry date, date of birth,

Alternatively, he could post those details here, and I'm sure his characters will find a welcome home.
