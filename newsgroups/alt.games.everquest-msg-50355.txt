Greetings,

Thank you all for the exhaustive information about the guilds and spellbook.

As for fishing vs. foraging I have been attempting to use foraging but it is
completely unreliable at this low level so I've taken to fishing
occasionally to keep myself in food and foraging when I can.  I've been
stacking the foraged food (in the bank) to save room [I'm just a lil' ol
halfling] and I find it works well this way.  I do believe my forage skill
is only at level 14.  Also, if I get tired of getting my butt kicked (which
is happening less and less often as I go up in level) I go fishing.  No risk
and all that.

As for the spells I will buy those spells I think I need, look up the
effects and all that.  Right now I can't wait until level 14 so I can get
sow and bind. =)

Thank you all for your help.
