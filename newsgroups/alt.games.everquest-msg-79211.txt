I can't believe that myth about "final damage" is still roaming around.
It's been proven wrong years ago.

Damage shields don't count towards anyone's credit so you have to keep that
in mind.  If a critter has 100hp and a damage shield alone brings it down to
5hp, you'd better do 3 points damage before your pet does 2 (but someone had
better do ONE point or else you get no xp at ALL :) ) or he'll take a
healthy chunk of xp.  This is true of all pet classes.

It's true when powerleveling someone, too.  The nastiest thing a level 49
druid/mage you can do to level 1-2 newbies is cast the best damage shield on
them.  They'll so rarely get a kill, experience, or loot that if they know
what's good for them they'll kill that bugger altogether and do without.
