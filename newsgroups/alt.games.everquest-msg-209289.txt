Not quite what I meant.  On emp you have 8 mobs already contained for the
whole duration of the fight, subbing a class to hail/loot isn't a big deal.
When you have 50 mobs running around though, meleeing for 400's,
backstabbing and the like, its a whole different level.

Perseverence is the ultimate factor though, thats for sure.  Most guilds
I've seen defeat RZ have plucked away for weeks, and often months.

I recall Monuals posts here during their attempts spanning at least a month
(maybe even 2?).  A guild on Prexus just defeated RZ too, their first run
was around April-May.  The guys i've been raiding with on VS took a month+
too (infact I only know 1 exception [tho im sure lots more do exist]).

My original prexus guild started the RZ event for the first time on [random]
Sunday in April, and our progress went something like
Sunday - 1 of TZ/VZ dead (but not both)
Monday - killed Fake Rallos, 12% wipe on first ever RZ run (those are always
the most agonising!)
Tuesday - some poor attempts, 30% and  60% wipes on real RZ
Wednesday - killed RZ

Add to that countless wipes on TZ, buggy scripts (how about TZ coming back
to life 5 mins after you killed him, with VZ inc!), 1 RZ train on us, and
multiple sloppy ass attempts, and it was 1 painful hard worked experience

Btw a tip: on the pull, don't pull him directly from his static location to
the corner. Try and run him parallel to the side wall (feign him on the wall
and then have the MA or WS ranger tag it). Reason for this is otherwise your
clerics are inside AE-ramp range.  Sure ae-ramp isn't common, but it is
guaranteed. And if your clerics eat it on inc, your at an instant loss.

Good luck! Its an ass event, but for sure its worth it in the end.
