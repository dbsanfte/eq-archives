Godsmack - I Stand Alone

I've told you this
Once before
Can't control me
If you
Try to take me down
Your going to break
I feel your hatred
And think that you'll do it for me
I'm thinkin that
Your the measure of the way

I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone

Your always hidin
Behind your so called godess
so what
You don't think
That he can see your face
resurected back
Before the final falling
I'll never rest until
I can make my own way
I'm not afraid
Of fading

I stand alone
You let your
Sting down inside me
I'm not dying for any

I stand alone
Everything
That I believe is fading

I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone

And now it's my time
And now it's my time
It's my time to dream
It's my time to dream
Dream of the skies
Dream of the skies

Make me believe
That this place isn't paid
By the poison in me
Help me decide
If my fire will burn out
Before you can breath
Breathe into me

I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone

You let your
Sting down inside me
I'm not dying for any

I stand alone
Everything
That I believe is fading

I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone
Inside
