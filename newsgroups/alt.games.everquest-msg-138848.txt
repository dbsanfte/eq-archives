If ten people post it to the dev corner, we'll probably get it in the next
patch. Horses where never going to happen, hell levels were never to be
fixed and a whole score of other things got changes even though they said

merest possibility of ever crossing their minds.

So, lets make a list of things we want, send it in while they seem to be in
a giving mood.
