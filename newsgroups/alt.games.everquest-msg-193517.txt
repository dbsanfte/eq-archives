Sorry DT, but I'm not interested in taking anybody's side here.  All
I was doing was trying to get through to you the idea that there
isn't any need for there to be a side to take.  Davian didn't pick a
fight with you.  He pointed out, in a fairly neutral fashion, that
you were making an incredibly broad statement.  Instead of taking
that as an opportunity to clarify or focus the point you intended to
make, you started arguing.  And you were rather defensive about it.
At that point Davian teased you a bit, taking advantage of a straight
line that quite frankly begged for his reply.  Now you appear to be
having a hissy fit, and with so little provocation that it looks
mighty comical.  The point I'm trying to get across here is that if,
instead of treating Davian's responses as some sort of assault on
your manhood, you had treated them as an opportunity to make clear
to him what exactly it was that you meant to say, there wouldn't have
been an argument.

I can say from personal experience that I've tried to be a lot less
confrontational lately in the NG (well, except for "Tom", heh), and
it certainly looks to me like I'm making an ass of myself a lot less
frequently.

YMMV  :)
