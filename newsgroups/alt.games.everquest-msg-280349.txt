Wow that is news to me.  Actually I'm not sure I ever tested it though,
or if I did I was casting while standing so the benefit of the mount
was not realized.  You may be right, I'll have to test this sometime.
It sounds like I'll have to use my mount a lot more.  (I like the mount
but having the freedom of movement and to instantly interrupt spells is
so important to me, especially when I am worried about getting agro)
