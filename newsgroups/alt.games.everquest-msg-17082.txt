This bugs the heck out of me too.  To me, a big part of a good group is the
members communicating with each other.  If somebody won't even bother to ask
if I want to group, what I'm hunting, before inviting me, there is no way I
want to group with them...

My most annoying one was in the Qeynos bank.  I was moving things around in
my vault, and got a group invite.  A quick /who showed me it was from an
11th level paladin.  I can sort of understand brand new players being
confused and doing random invites because they don't know what they're
doing, but if somebody is still that clueless after playing long enough to
make 11th level...

What made this invite so annoying is that it happened before they added text
commands for inviting/disbanding: I had to stop what I was doing and exit my
bank vault so I could click on the button to cancel the invite.
