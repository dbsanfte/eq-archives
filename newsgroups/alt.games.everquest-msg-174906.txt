*** Patch Information ***

** Gameplay/Features **

- With our last patch and the patch today, we've significantly reduced the
amount of bandwidth that EverQuest needs to use, even in large raid or
extremely-crowded-zone situations.
- Fixed a problem with tints not properly updating when armor is removed.
- Fixed a bug with character faces displaying incorrectly to other players
when you zone in after them.
- Fixed resurrection timer that was counting down against the 3 hour limit
when player was not logged in.
- Corrected a problem with health and movement updates being delayed.


** Spells **

- NPCs will now notice Druid and Shaman Percentage Heal spells in a manner
similar to traditional healing spells.
- Removed the chance for slow spells to be reversed from the 17 NPCs that
had this ability.
- Fixed a bug that was preventing Curses, Diseases, and Poisons from being
removed.
- Raised all recast times below 2.25 seconds up to 2.25 seconds. This is a
change in the spell data as the first part of a two-part change needed to
correct the "Recast time not met" problem. More information is available at
the Developer's Corner at www.everquest.com.


** Alternate Advancement/Special Abilities **

- The range on the Bard Ability "Boastful Bellow" has been increased
slightly.
- Fixed a bug with Harm Touch that was not allowing it to increase the
standard amount per level over level 60.


** User Interface **

- Fixed a bug with effects in the Songs window. They were not getting
removed on the client when the bard was dispelled.
- Introduced new Story window. The purpose of this window is to provide
story updates in a readily available location. ALT-N toggles the window. You
can select to have the window pop up when new story elements are added if
you wish.
- Item Links are once again creatable from Items and from other Item Links.
Please do not attempt to "mine" the servers for undiscovered items. Links
now have a built-in mechanism to prevent those who would go on fishing
expeditions by sending up many bad links in an attempt to discover new
items. These invalid links are logged, as are the accounts of those who
create them.
- Added an optional confirmation box before spending AA points. To turn on
this confirmation box, please check the Options window.


** Miscellaneous **

- Sage Quests in Plane of Knowledge have been fixed.
- The event to fight Bertoxxulous in the Crypt of Decay will reset 4 to 6
hours after the event is failed. It will respawn normally if the event is
won.


** New/Changed Interface Files **

- EQUI_StoryWnd.xml (actually added with the Jan. 9th patch)
- EQUI_OptionsWnd.xml
