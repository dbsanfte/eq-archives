Ok. Lately, it has been determined that dumping all possible points
into STA is the way to go for a melee char in most cases. Before that
movement started, I created a couple of melees and boosted things like
STR and DEX/AGI. My human monk has a base STA of 85.

Now, I have no intention of re-rolling my char's. - monk is level 21
now. However, I *would* feel a bit better about things if I heard from
higher level players who botched their starting stats and whether or
not it is a noticeable disadvantage.
