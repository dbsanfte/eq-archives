This is one of my biggest annoyances of people on EQ. It doesn't matter what
you buy, some moron will always say "Psh Ghoulbane? (for example) How
crappy! My Uber-30k-2HS sword is much better" neglecting the fact that you
probably spent a week trying to get it in a quest or that their sword is for
levels twice that of yours.. grrr. Same happens with armour and practically
anything else.

And why the heck do people make out SCHWs are so much better than FBSS?
There is like, 1% haste difference. Tsk
