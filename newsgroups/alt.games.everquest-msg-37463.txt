Not trying to say that grammatical style had anything to do with my opinion,
but it just didn't *look* like a troll.  It was concise, had no typos, and
even had paragraphs.  I guess I'm still remembering the mess that some of
the posts from P&H and that ilk subjected us to.  But if this was a troll, I
can stand more of it.
