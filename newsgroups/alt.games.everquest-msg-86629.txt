Didnt have any failures at any of the quests (althought i was THIS close 
to screaming after the 3rd one, when i had a small lag spike, so after 
combining the griffon egg souffle i had 10 sec where it didnt tell me i 
succeded).

For the 6th shawl, my tailoring was at 178 or 179, for the 7th shawl my 
skills were:
Baking 160
Brewing 177
Fletching 175 (only done for shawl)
Jewelcraft 168 (only done for shawl)
Pottery 188 (max with poison vials, can only get higher by those lousy 
idols it take half a day to get materials for)
Tailoring 182.

As for my other skills at the time (needed indirectly to do the other 
skills), they were:
Smithing 176 (needed for tailoring to get high enough)
Fishing 176 (needed for tailoring, and fishing some fish for 7th shawl)

Griffon eggs dont seem so bad any more, i still hear about those 
horrible 12 hour hunts for the eggs, but the times i helped guildies get 
the eggs (im needed for tracking), we usually got 4 eggs in 1-2 hours.
