You know, with my hp, +avoidance mod items and such, I probably take much
less damage than you (2k ac.. but well..maybe not that much less from the
ac, heh).. but I still fd mobs in front of a tank, rather than let it beat
on me while he pulls it off.  Regardless of taking the damage or not, if
agro is not concentrated on just 1 person, then the cleric is wasting mana.
So id rather not get hit, than have the cleric need to heal me each pull,
possibly causing more frequent med breaks, and thats pretty much regardless
of what kind of damage I take.

I also find fding it infront allows the tank (warrior) to lock agro down a
bit easier.. but thats another debate for another day

How is it a weakness for monks, when every single pure melee is in the same
boat?  Some of you people sure do confuse your own arguments..
