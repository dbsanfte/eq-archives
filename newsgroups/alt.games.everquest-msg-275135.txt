You can't.  A sage isn't suddenly going to be able to make vanguard armor, 
for example.  Only the base _components_ needed for their own recipies.  The 
interdependency that was there was extreme.

See above.   They aren't making the crafting classes able to create anything 
they wish, so trying to compare that to a Ranger casting spells like a mage 
has no validity.
