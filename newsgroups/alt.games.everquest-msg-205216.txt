Bearform HP regen stacks with Chloro et al, so its not a question of "much
better hp regen".

I use Fungal Regrowth (clicky off staff, not the worn variety) plus CIC plus
Worm eaten spell charm plus Troll natural regen, sitting my total regen is 25
hp a tic, standing its only 22 hp a tic though.  Now that I have Stoicism,
this really isn't an issue, I'm considering dumping all my hp regen gear
entirely; I never wait for hp regen, I use Stoicism very freely, and an extra
100 hp a minute doesn't seem that big a deal anymore

IMO Mounts are useless for travel purposes, moving they have all the oddities
of accelleration issues, deceleration issues, targetting issues, and dont
provide their real benefit, which is meditation without sitting and without
sit aggro.  Rather than focus on them as movement tools, think of their
movement as the price you have to pay... and click them off whenever the
three seconds to resummon one when you stop won't be a big deal.

If you solo by DOT and root casting, then a mount means you are sitting 100%
of the time instead of only 90%... you get meditation time while casting
instead of only while not otherwise busy.  Plus the fact that you aren't
sitting means your aggro radius for adds is smaller.  If you solo with your
pet as sole tank, then sitting is even more handy, since its easier to keep
the mob on your pet.

My latest tactical discovery is that I can use myself as sponge, with attack
off, to absorb the damage while my pet does the killing, and still get
meditation because I'm on horseback (drogmor in this case).
