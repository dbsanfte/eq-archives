I disagree.  Particular programs may have been "unfair to whites".
Affirmative action, the ideal, is considerably less unfair than
most of what all of us have to endure in the world.  Wealth, on
the other hand, is patently unfair, providing enormous advantages
to those born wealthy.  Your "open marketplace" argument goes a lot
further in support of radical socialist redistribution of wealth
than it does in support of an attack on affirmative action.  And
so I'll dump your attack on affirmative action into the same trash
heap where I left the bullshit from the radical socialists.
