More damage per hit but it's also a lot slower. The Sprinkler is 20/32 
DMG/DLY whereas the Hammer of Damnation is 14/18. Even without the
proc, the Hammer is a much better melee weapon.

I'm no expert on weapon proc augments, but I'd be really surprised 
if one exists (CLR-usable anyway) that can top Hand of the Gods, 
simply due to the frequency at which it fires.

If you want to augment the Sprinkler, look for something that will
be useful in non-combat mode, like Flowing Thought. However, there
are plenty of primary slot items which are better for that use than
the Sprinkler. Mine only comes out of the bag for rezzing and 
tradeskilling, so if I were to augment it I'd go +WIS.
