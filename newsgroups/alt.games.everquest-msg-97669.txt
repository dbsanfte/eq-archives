Hrmm, While I welcome the elimination of hell levels, They were never really
an issue to me. But then, I play the game not as a race to 60 but as "where
can I go and what can I do today". Even during hell levels (and I've done
all the hell levels except for 59th), there were many places for me to go
fight and have fun... doing that seemed to make them just breeze by.
