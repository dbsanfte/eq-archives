Man, could I make a fortune if I had the answer to those.  Anyone who says
they can answer them is full of shit.

When I was in college, we spent almost a whole quarter of an ethics class
debating those very questions .. almost in that order.  What we determined
was that they couldn't be answered ... not without having the ability to
interview God on the subject.

Y'know, I was literally forced by the Board of Regents to take that ethics
class to get my biology/chemisrty degree.  I hated it at the time, but
looking back on it I think that was one of the most fun classes I took in
college.

It depends on how one forms the argument.  If one looks at the Christian
bible as a holy document created by God through the hands of Moses (et.al.),
you can argue but will eventually hit the point of "God said it .. I believe
it .. that settles it" ... which makes all arguments with folks like that a
waste of time and an essay in futility.

If you've read the book through a couple of times and look at it as a
history of the Jews from the point of view of the writers of the time, you
can use it's passages the same way as one uses the recorded history of
Gettysburg to argue that if Lee had listened to Longstreet, those of us who
live south of the Mason-Dixon would be paying our taxes to Richmond now.
