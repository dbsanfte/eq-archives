Nah, he was better of with no rez at that level, loot, and get back to 
fighting righ away.  He'd end up ahead on xp vs getting a rez, then 
waiting for rez effects to wear off.  I soloed two characters through 
level 23 in PC, and I never got a rez on multiple deaths.  It would take 
me one or two kills to make up the xp lost.

At that level, it is a learning experience, and, it's not very painful 
yet.
