I got in a group with a warrior (who was being PL'd by a cleric friend) and
held the top of the archon pyramid for 3-4 hours killing anything that
moved. We didn't even see the holder and thus didn't even get a chance 
at the rare drop ravenscale.

Oh well, I head back with my shaman when she's the right level. I do like
the dungeon a lot though.

Nor I, but the ravenscale helm is fairly average..so no loss.
