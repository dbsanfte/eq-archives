   Really?  What's the name of your character?  Maybe we can get together
sometime.

   And to the OP, I wouldn't worry too much about the whining about transfers. 
The people who are doing the whining are still there, you'll notice.  I
attribute the whole thing to simple jealousy.  I certainly don't see how an
influx of level 65th characters is going to affect the playing style of the
average lowbie, save for the possibility of better stuff being for sell in the
bazaar sooner.  Don't listen to the whiners who say the server will fail.  They
are pessimists,  pretty much by definition.
