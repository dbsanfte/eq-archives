Spider silk very unlikely to find a merchant carrying them. You might get
some spiderling silks from amerchant. Find a real newbie area and examine
the merchants around the newbie zones as many 1-5 level characters are
more interested in the few silvers they pull compared to the tailoring
skills gained......Ak'Anon I've seen them reasonably frequently, GFAY
people find out their use pretty early and sell to players. Qeynos and
Freeport the same.....Halas quite often has them. Essentially look for a
relatively remote newbie zoe thats popular but tnot too popular on your
server with merchant readily available to the newbie region.
