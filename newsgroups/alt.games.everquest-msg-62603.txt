Clerics have the same line, almost always useless, I agree.  I've
been using it a lot recently... as I get clickable Tremor on my
boots, which at 122 damage every 10 seconds is a lot better
than my melee output.  If only it wasn't AOE, so I could
use it more often, instead of thinking like a bard being careful
with his AOE song which he wants to hit only one target.
