You beg from NPCs.  But if you're smart, you won't beg from ones
that can knock your head off if they take exception to it.

Note that "NPCs" also includes "monsters".  I work up my skill by
initiating each fight with a hotkey that does:

    /doability 2      <- Beg
    /attack

That way, I get a free Beg practice at the start of every fight.
And since I'm aggroing the monster on purpose anyway, who cares
if it hates me for begging?

Note:  Unlike weapons skills, you can and do get Beg skill
increases for Begging from creatures that are incredibly green to you.

I've also noticed that most of my successful Beg attempts come from
NPCs that are 1) Humanoid, and 2) already conning pretty friendly
to me (e.g. Kindly or Warmly).  That makes sense when you think
about it.  Furthermore, rather than have the friendly ones attack me,
a badly failed beg attempt will instead often get the "GO AWAY!"
vocalization instead of a sword to the chest.
