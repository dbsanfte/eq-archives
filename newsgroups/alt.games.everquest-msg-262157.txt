Here's where I am, after 24 hours of ya'll's good advice:

1> I'll fly my billing info into the separate ENC and CLR accounts.  No money down,
$12.95/month billing. :->

2> I'll purchase an EQ disc set, and create a free 30-day account.  $29.99 for EQ
Platinum.  "In order to process a transfer from one account to a different account, the
destination account must have access to the same expansions as the source account."

3> I'll get everything out of the ENC's and CLR's shared bank slots.  "Shared Bank Slots
will not be transferred."

4> I'll  ask Sony to transfer the ENC and CLR to the new account.  $50 for a 2-character
transfer.  "For moving characters from one of your accounts to one of your other accounts
but not changing to a different server: 1 to 2 Characters $50"

5> The ENC and CLR will lose their tags.  No bogie.  "We will be removing any guild

Do you see any advantage to laying low for a billing cycle (or two) between #1 and #4?

Ditto for #2 and #4? --- but I'll be paying on 4 accounts if it goes past 30 days!!

If Customer Service nixes the transfer, I'll take a pass on the CLR, and continue
month-to-month on the ENC account, canceling the billing after making each payment, to
minimize my exposure from...whatever.  Plausible?
