Brisbane, which means it's only when we get a spate of cool weather that
they head for our roof cavity (and it is cold now, getting below 7'c) but
otherwise will normally stay in the gum trees out back. Unfortunately "out
back" is level with my second storey bedroom at the back of the house and
only about half a dozen meters away....

It is funny watching and listening to pissed animals (ie Possums and
Parrots) as they behave just like humans given half a bootful. Way too noisy
and fighting non-stop ; )

We have one of those umbrella type trees out the back with the fronds of
those red "bean" type fruit that ferment as well in the sun, so we get the
pissed Parrots as well. It is funny seeing them go to fly away but just fall
to the ground in a crumpled squawking mess... : )
