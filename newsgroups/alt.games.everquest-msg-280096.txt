Those aren't game design flaws, those are social flaws.  I have,
uncoincidentally, seen plenty of complaints about the fact that Sony tried
to deal with social flaws through game design and the resulting
immersion-killing heavy handed "solutions" they implemented.

The sheer volume of comments regarding the recent change to this suggests
that it was considered a "big problem" by a sizeable portion of the players.

Notice, the term was "dependance", not some casual vs. raider debate. 
Again, you're equating social issues and broad-stroke genre-wide concepts,
with the game-specific mechanics.  A good counterpoint to maybe give you an
understanding of the topic would be the games Guild Wars and City of Heroes. 
Both have "gear".  In both you can get "better" "gear".  But in both of them
the gear comes so easily and/or has such a miniscule impact that the games
are never described as "gear dependant".

Right...  that was kind of the point.  =P

Same complaint, because it's the same company with their same mindset behind
it.  Guild Wars, which patches damn near daily (far different sort of
patching system, specifically designed to let them do so without disrupting
play) has never had a bad patch.  There are other games that approach that
elusive "never had a bad patch" goal.  Sony games...  don't even try.  =)

Ok, purposefully obtuse.  Thanks for clearing that up.  At least you snipped
out the "EQ2 was it" part this time so that your response wouldn't look
totally vapid.  =)

As well, you should research the actual meaning of "ad hominem".  A quick
and dirty tutorial is "You suck, so you're wrong", hardly applicable to my
"attack" which was "You suck" and "You're wrong because...".  =)

I reiterate my responsive paragraph above.  =P
