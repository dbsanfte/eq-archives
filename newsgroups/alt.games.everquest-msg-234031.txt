True. When running from the entry to NEB (north east bottom or basement, 
  depending on your server) I stop to con everything when I get near/in 
the building. I've seen a number of the white colored armor suits 
(forget which mob name at the moment) that see invis. Fortunately, all 
the mobs in HoH have an aggro range of about six inches, so they are 
easy to run around and avoid. I've yet to see a sentry, guardian, etc. 
of the human form ones see invis, but that's no guarantee.

They also have an incredibly small aggro range. (At least to level 65's 
they do) and aren't much of a problem even if you aggro them.
