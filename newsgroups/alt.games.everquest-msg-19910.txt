If I remember correctly, the EULA specifies that the names should be
consistent with a fantasy setting and not break fiction. Kitty Kat may
not be as bad as "Labiara", "Sownazi" (and his spawn, "Shamaly
Theorignalsownazi"(sic) or "Tomtomtomtom", but it does grate a bit.

Still, I've seen worse, and it wouldn't cross my mind to petition that
one. At least not first. 

P.S. I'm a paid-up member of the Cat Protection League, so don't give me
lip about not liking cats... :-P
