Why is that "quite rightly?"

What inherently makes a motive of hate more punishable
than a motive of greed?  If the people who killed Matthew
Shepard, for instance, had been "out for kicks," would
the crime be any different in the eyes of society?

As an example:

A rapist targets a white female because of her race.  He
also rapes a black female because she was an "easy" target.
The crimes happen in different jurisdictions and separate
trials are held.

When convicted, you're saying he should be punished more for
raping a white woman than a black one although the method and
relevant details (his "MO") for both crimes may be precisely
the same.

This is justice?  I think she'd tell you to shove it if he
received 25 years for raping the white woman but 15 for raping
her...
