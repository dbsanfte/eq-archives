Stretching for excuses to call me names and try to make me look bad.
It's backfiring, skippy.

Right. Vague "someone here said it but they didn't know it and I'm not
gonna say who or what it was" bail-out. You're looking pretty pathetic
there. Pony up so it can be tested or admit you're full of shit.

Yes, sometimes the game just crashes. Sometimes the game just crashes
in the Bazaar. Given the conditions in the Bazaar, it's perfectly
reasonable for the game to crash there more often. You find some
little trick and crash less often. Ever hear of this radical concept
called "coincidence"?

The real reason you won't tell? You're afraid someone will test it and
it won't work for them, thus proving you're full of shit.

And I suppose the distinction between bugs which wreak havoc on
players and workarounds for imaginary bandwidth-saving ploys is beyond
your grasp...

You refuse to cite, only making vague claims, and accuse me of lacking
substance? Why, Hello, Mr Pot...
