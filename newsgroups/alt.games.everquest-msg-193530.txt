Erm, and what are you basing that on?

When I have recieved kei, it was when I was practising spells with my =
wizard and the guy said he would give me kei, the other time was when I =
was making some arrows, and sowing people for CR in pok, again the guy =
said I could have it.

Im so sorry if I dont want to waste my money on a buff, if its offered =
sure but I dont need it and aint gonna give money for mana. =20

If a enchanter wants to sit in pok getting plat for mana all day thats =
up to them, but they wont be getting plat from me.
