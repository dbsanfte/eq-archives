Upper Guk and Oasis are the two that stand out for me. Frequently
entering either of those two zones slows things to a *crawl*. 
Reboot will fix it, which strongly suggests memory leak.

This is different than the consistent low framerate in outdoor 
Luclin zones which seems to be a "too many polygons for my
hardware" thing.
