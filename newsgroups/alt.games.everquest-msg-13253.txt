100 pp seems to be a fairly firmly established rate, I won't pay the
sometimes asked 110pp, but will buy several stacks any time the
guy who actions them at 80pp comes thru.

You'll rarely see anyone selling 5 stack or especially one stack,
although at lower levels I specifically wanted single SOW to
put in bank for CR.

On the other hand, I almost quit the game in my mid 30s first time
through, unable to get JBoots and dying too regularly to think
about without SOW on, just crossing zones, sometimes.  The
release of stackable potions made all the difference, I happily
kept up the 10pp a sip habit till my mid 40s when I finally
got JBoots.  Unstacked, SOW Potions took up too much
space or meant continuous runs in to the bank, its the stacking
that made them viable.

If your potions aren't selling, its because you are asking too
much, or you are in zones where there's lots of competition
or players of too low a level.  Try especially Great Divide,
where you can sit fairly safely by Thurgadin zone line; lots
of potential customers here, as its a formup/pit stop area
with a bank nearby, as a bonus, all the ingrediants you need
to restock are right in there.

A note: I"ll never buy potions a second time from anyone
who doesn't throw in a free cast SOW as a matter of
course.  Obviously if I'm buying SOW I need it.  Sure,
sometimes I'm in a group with a SOW caster and actually
-don't- need it, but the lack of that gesture tells me that
the seller is thoughtless and selfish.  You've just valued
a level 9 spell at 10pp a cast, after all, and the mana
cost simply isn't that high.

Fondly remembering the guy on Luclin who always made
SOW potions for me at cost just because I resed him once
for free
