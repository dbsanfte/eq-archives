I PL'd a bard to manasong levels on a second account.  Then I'd do a quad,
group the bard and listen to manasong, disband, do a quad...  I still have a
hotkey for "/tar Fyneas /invite" and one for "/disband" somewhere in my
hotkey bank, around page 7 or so.  After KEI became available, I moved my
enchanter to the second account so I could KEI the wizard, THEN group the
bard for manasong.

That was for solo work, of course.  For grouping, pre-KEI, I simply sucked.
I wish I still had a copy of the post my then-guildleader made, begging
guildies to group with the guild wizards and help them level so we could
have high-level wizards on raids - because the entire guild was out-leveling
the four wizards we had and the raid leader wanted wizard firepower.
