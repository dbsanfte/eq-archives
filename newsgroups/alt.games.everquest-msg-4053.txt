Quick summary: he's a troll from the FA newsgroup, trying to pass
himself off as someone with a brain superior to everyone in this group
aside from his cronies (also from the FA newsgroup). Thinks constantly
changing his name is a sign of maturity, and has a strong Lokari
obsession. Has already been publically booted by one service provider
for trying to write fake Lokari posts.

His only accomplishment to date has been to unite every single regular
against him and the other FA trolls.
