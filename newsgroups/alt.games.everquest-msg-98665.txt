I'm wondering about stacking of all debuffs
OOS (26 FR/CR/MR)
Tash (highest one is 60 MR)
Malo (45 FR/CR/MR/PR)
Ro's Smouldering Disjunction (67 FR)
Scent of Terris (36 FR/PR/DR)
Insidious Decay (40 DR)
Staff of Temperate Flux (6 FR/CR)

If they all stack, you've got
76 DR
81 PR
131 MR
180 FR
113 CR
