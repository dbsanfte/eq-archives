With my tellhell as guild officer and banker I normally get reminded of an
afk tag within seconds :).

As for auto afk disabling. No. Autofollow for instance is a good method to
go afk during raids. Just auto a caster or healer and you won't be lost when
you come back. The afk message is pretty usefull to inform other people of
your status and are not able to provide services. Dual boxers also often use
the autofol and afk combo to get a bot set up (You won't value a rezbot till
one saves the day ;) ), you won't believe the number of dumb people asking
that bot for buffs even when it was said so in the main raid channel.

Also I have some friends who like to put up the afk tag to avoid talking to
people. It's not the nicest way but with human emotions sometimes running
high it's often a good method. That tag should stay up then for as long as
they play or feel like it.


In short, just don't forget it :p
