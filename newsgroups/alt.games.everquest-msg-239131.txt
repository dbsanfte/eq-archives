Correct yes. As for other people having it setup ... I wouldn't assume
that. I use it when i group with my brother, or other RL friends
mostly.

I'd use it in raid organization as well, or in guild groups with
people I liked.

And honestly, if a pickup group asked about it I'd probably decline,
even if I had the setup they were interested in...no offense to anyone
in particular but half of the twits I run into... the group-chat is
bearable, but I wouldn't want to have to listen to their leetness
pontificate on whatever areas they felt inclinded in full surround
stereo. :)
