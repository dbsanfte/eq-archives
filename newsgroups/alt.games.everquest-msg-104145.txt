Well, my lil Druid dinged 46 about a week ago (I'm slow, I have more
characters than I know what to do with). I was running her through
Feerrott when I saw a shout "Fear raid forming, leaving in 1 hour".
After pondering for a second, I decided what the heck. Sent the leader
a tell asking if he minded babysitting a planes newbie, he said to
come right along.

I wound up being put in charge of the 5th group. (eep!) The break went
rather quickly, then I invised and lev'd my group up and we charged
in. First pull, we lost several people, myself included, but not an
actual wipe. Rezzes came, and we got back to work. I spent most of the
time restoring dispelled buffs, healing when needed, and tossing the
occasional nuke (mostly while looking at the ground or the wall behind
me. Damn lag. ;-) ). We didn't wipe until after the raid was
"officially" over... We were "farting around" a bit after the last
cleric left, and the puller brought a bit more than we could handle.
We got a couple clerics (One I drug in from my guild for rezzing)
together to rez everyone and decided to head out. ;-)

Only one piece of Verm dropped, the crown (which really isn't all that
hot... Int, but not wis on a druid item?!), but one of the other 3
druids there won it. Oh well. All in all, it was enjoyable. A learning
experience if nothing else. For my first time in, I'd say I handled
myself pretty well...
