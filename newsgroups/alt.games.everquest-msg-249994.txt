These are the top items on their agenda? LoL, this is what happens when you
send the top raiding guilds to the focus group.

I thought the summit idea was pretty refreshing and a great vehicle for
starting down the path of change. And then I read how they were planning the
invites. I can't help thinking that this is like President Bush deciding to
improve Middle East relations by calling together a summit and then inviting
the leaders of the top militant muslim groups across the middle east.
Guaranteed to give you good, representative feedback that will improve your
overall game. And sure to make the rest of the citizens of the community
feel like their voice was heard. Uh huh.

Well, best of luck to everyone still participating, maybe something good
will come of all this. And if the current trend reverses itself and the game
actually picks up traction again, and CoH, WoW, or EQ2 fail to capture or
maintain ongoing interest, maybe I'll be back yet again to find out.
