Hotkeys mean delay, each line takes a bit of time to process.  These 
delays are inconsequential for most classes, but for a bard they are the 
difference between adequate and excellent.

Use hotkeys and you cost yourself the ability to twist in that fifth 
song for sure, probably that fourth song.

And is the instrument mod on your gear as it is on your best possible 
intrument?  I don't know, honestly, perhaps at POT levels the instrument 
mods on weapons are better than the best weapons.  I do know that on 
gear I could afford back when I was playing a bard regularly, I sure 
wasn't doing better... and I talked to several epic bards who said that 
they only used their epic when they were feeling lazy, or swapped it in 
for the Singing parts of their twist... a serious lack of "singing" 
enhancers.  The kind of gear you are talking about for the ranger might 
mean gear I never even heard of for the bard, though, maybe they 
wouldn't be sacrifing any of their output after all.

Yes, it does.  Meantime the "real" bard is doing 5 songs and a couple of 
the songs he's doing are doing 25% more effect.  This would be 
comperable to the ranger hitting his key every 2.5 seconds even though 
his bow can fire at 1.5 seconds.

Sure, if you want to run your bard in a dual box, doing roughly 2/3rds 
what he -could- be doing, you can do it that way.  You aren't going to 
push out a 5 twist on automatic, though, and you really aren't going to 
be running what you -do- sing at its best, unless I'm wrong about the 
effectiveness of those non instrument instrument items at the very high end.

Oh, and when you have to change your song lineup on the fly, its even 
worse; you're locked into those hotkeys for a fraction of a second, 
people are dying!
