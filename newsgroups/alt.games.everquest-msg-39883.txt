Only problem is that you can NOT see the mobs hp drop before you get into a
range for it. And for casters your spellcasting range is bigger than the see-hp
range. Just try soloing giants in FM near the DL zone as a druid, a lot of
people will attack your giants before they see its taken, because they dont see
you halfway up a mountainside, and the mob dont look damaged before the first
spell they cast land.

I know about it as a druid, and i can still cast snare or a nuke on a mob
before i see its taken.
