    No, you cannot. Much of the applied knowledge needed to know how a given
class performs is not written in any guide you'd find on the web. Things
like pathing and encounter geometry just aren't discussed, to give some very
concrete examples.

> You can't refine tactics needed at those levels without it

    The tactics are what a class is. You can't say you know what a class
*is* without knowing what a class can *do*. And you can't know what a class
can do, what it REALLY can do as opposed to what it can do on paper, without
going out and doing. Most of the class nerfs in EQ come when players go out
and show the developers exactly how incomplete dev knowledge is of the game,
and the devs have access to the most complete "on paper" knowledge of the
game possible.

> It's a fucking ignorant attitude at that.

    I smell irony.
