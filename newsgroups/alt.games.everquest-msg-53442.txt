I agree too. FIghting blues solo is most efficient, expessially under
lvl 10.  Doesn't take much mana at all and can do them one after
another. If go for yellows and red you can kill them (sometimes) but
will take all your juice, pet will be wounded, might even take two
pets, and you'll be down for 5 minutes.

Heck I made a bard twink on Test server, I was killing xp giving
greens and low blues by the handfull. Running around EFP singing
damage song. Kill 8 or 9 at a pop, very small chance of dying and xp
was super fast.
