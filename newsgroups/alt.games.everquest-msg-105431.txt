In case you need reminding, you were the one who took the offensive
first in this thread. All I did at first was ask you if you always
assumed the extreme case when you can't connect to something.

You got what was coming to you. Don't cry innocent now.

You better understand something else, too; there's a lot of people who
hate EQ and the subject header you used is a typical thing to claim in
efforts to troll those who don't hate it.
