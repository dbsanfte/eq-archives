I've not seen anything like that, but if someone sees your post and
says "that would be cool...think I'll write it!", here's an idea for
them:

If the second computer has access to the Everquest directory on the
first computer (e.g., if the player makes that directory shared), then
you could probably automate a lot of this by looking at the log file.
You could watch for the "Soandso has looted a whatchamacallit"
messages to keep track of turns or value.

Also, besides keeping track of looting, keep track of buffs.  It would
be great if an alarm went off on the second computer and when you look
over, you see "Conan's SOW will be wearing off in 1 minute".
