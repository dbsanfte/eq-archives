Its done in every group now. Like any group with media or naughty
pictures has 15,000 posts about elongating your naughty bit. I am just
happy that those are not here yet but they will be probably. The
problem is that tons of people are doing those and often posting anon
or through remailers or crap and its a wonder that it doesn't happen
more instead of less.

Yeah, I mostly don't bother doing anything though since there is just
too much crap now. For example, I sent some post about games and apps
a pirate was selling in some group to the SPA or whatever and
microsoft but then later I notice the same posts from some not real
place with 2 totally new web pages to buy from.
