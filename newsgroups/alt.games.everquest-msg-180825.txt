Because, we are talking computer AI here. If they were as cunning at 
fighting as we are, they could do the things that we do. Take a caster 
for instance. It would really suck if you came across a "smart" druid 
MOB that kited you butt. Root, dot, run out of casting distance, sit and 
med, root breaks, rinse and repeat. They have to make it challenging 
some what. If you make a mistake, you're gonna get hit for it.
