To inspect items, you shift left click on them, or you can
right click and hold, which will get you a window which
lets you inspect or (something I forget) or delete.

You can aparantly only have one inspect window up at a time, which makes 
comparing a little annoying.

Its also important to note that you can see two items with identical 
names and icon, but they may be of different quality levels.  The higher 
QL items may have higher requirements but generally also have higher 
bonuses.

So its a good idea, apparantly, to inspect everything interesting that 
you loot, even if you are already wearing one like it; the one you 
looted might be an upgrade.

I'm now a level 6 adventurer (Dixon) and level 5 Engineer (Quaffle) and 
about to go start someone new on server 1, in order to try out melee 
instead of the ranged and pet based characters I made so far.
