Maybe it's beneath the world, like what commonly happens to mobs running
away from FoB hunters. The mob goes beneath the world and you can't attack
it because of the z-axis difference. Pets cans still attack it, so if you're
a pet class and the tank starts getting clobbered by one of these
"invisible" mobs, just /assist the tank and /pet attack %T.

Hope that helps.
