Rofl.

A few pieces are more geared to PLing than using on the final character.
(fungi)

It's mostly just a list of stuff I have/had that's cleric usable (cept the
fungi; every time I think about buying one, something else comes up to spend
money on, my current plat hole is the fucking rare spectral spells, 40k in
bazaar last night for command of tunare (lowest I've seen was 35k), already
paid 18k for pot9, want natures infusion (15k) too.

Time for another kael farm run (/pray plate bp 35k yay) =/  too bad all the
crap at the bank went green at 62.  Oh well, at least my 58 warrior rl
friend will be happy getting a little afk exp while he sleeps, and with near
zero risk since he's an assling (racial hide; infinite duration invis as
long as he doesn't move... which he won't since he's sleeping).  PoJ caves
are good farm runs too (alkaline etched stones and crystallized cloudy eyes;
traded 2 stones for my valorium ring, sold eye for 4k), but last few times
I've gone there my spot's been camped =( and horse nerf makes it likely that
I'll not be going back.
