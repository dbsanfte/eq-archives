I'm finding, as perhaps many new players (as opposed to new characters --
I'm learning there's a big difference....) do, that EQ can be a series of
very "scary" steps.  I'm a level 12 halfling druid who's never been out of
Misty/Riverdale, and who's never grouped.  When I was level 9 and getting
close to 10, I was really worried about dying after 10.  Of course, since
I've never left the safe confines of these areas, I've found out it's no big
deal for now, but I've become very concerned about what to do when I leave!

So, I'm just looking for some words of wisdom here.  Reading up on the
adjoining zones, it seems like maybe I should just never leave, because I'm
unlikely to survive alone, and then I won't be able to find my corpse, and,
and, and.....

I guess what I need to do is find some other players near my level who are
willing to group with someone clueless about grouping.  But many of the
characters I meet at my level are actually being played by more experienced
game players.
