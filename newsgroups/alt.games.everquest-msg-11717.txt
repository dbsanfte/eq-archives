True, adding these raw skill points isn't exactly what I'd call
accurate analysis...  :)   It's only to give a rough comparison of the
defensive half of melee.  (I'm sure you meant, "1 point of defense
ISN'T the same as 1 point of dodge)
I confess I'm not familiar with this "2 shield configuration" you
mention, but I don't think that 10 or even 20 AC difference will make
up for your opponent having 4 significant things you don't:  Double
Attack, Disarm, Dual Wield, and Riposte, not to mention higher skill
levels in all of these.  Getting down to little details like an
FBSS...  Both players could have an FBSS.  

I'm sure there's way too many factors and variables to measure any of
this with anything more of a rough comparison.

As I've said before, there's two comparisons being done in this
thread, and I'm just trying to point out that they are not the same
thing.  The first comparison is pure tanking ability between classes,
and the second is overall combat effectiveness, spells included.

Getting back to Barry's original question...  If he wants to be a
"tank", then he should exclude Shaman from the list.  That DOESN'T
mean that Shaman are "weaker" than tanks, just DIFFERENT.  It also
doesn't mean he shouldn't play a shaman either.  :)  It simply depends
on what role he wants to play in a group, and whether or not he wants
to be able to solo.
