I have to say that I am a casual gamer, though I can be very fixed and 
process oriented if I really want something. Case in point, I am 56, 
been playing for 2 years. i do have a fair number of alts, but in 
general I play Aruvqan 80% of the time. I have jewelcraft at 250, 
because I had the plat, and wanted the GM trophy and bag=) It was also a 
way to use up gem drops. Most of my other skills are at 200 except 
smithing and tailoring.

I play about 3 hours a day monday through friday, generally with my game 
husband either our mains doing LDoNs or in alts leveling them up. We 
play longer on weekends. We left a guild for other issues, but it was 
sort of a relief to not get pressured into raiding as generally neither 
of us got any xp, and rarely any drops. It was a dead end cycle of log 
in, push buttons and try to stay awake. I know that I shouldn't complain 
about the cleric stultifying boredom cycles as i *did* roll up a cleric. 
If I want raid-fu I should have rolled up a tank...

I just finished a week of camping the fabled priest, king and champion 
in sol b, monday through thursday about 4 hours each night after my game 
husband logged...I left when the rest of the group left. Last night I 
started camping at 3pm eastern time, and logged at 3 am eastern time 
with the fabled mithril BP I wanted. Why? Because I dont have the plat 
to buy the [nonexistant] ornate BP mold in Bazaar, and any other BP I 
was interested with the exception of an LDoN BP took a raid force to 
get. I originally was only helping a friend camp for it, but decided 
that it was an excellent upgrade, and one that for the forseeable future 
was the best I would be able to get for at least another year or so. 
Using pickup courtesy, I stayed an extra hour, through one more cycle of 
getting the bracer and BP for the next people on the list. A dang polite 
stretch of camping it was also, we talked, joked, danced and killed a 
lot of lightblue and green mobs...I actually made 4% of an aa point, and 
5% of a level=)

It is a shame these fabled mobs are going away...these old style long 
camps of pick-up mini-raids are about the only way that a casual or non 
guilded player like me is going to get something like this without 
interminible LDoN adventures...and it was actually sort of fun=)
