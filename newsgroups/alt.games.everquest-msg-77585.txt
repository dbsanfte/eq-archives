 'Uberguild' or not I don't think it matters. Any guild that is serious
about raids should have at least one 49 cleric gimp. It really doesn't
take that long to Powerlevel one. A new guild usually dies a lot while
learning to function on raids. Do you really want your main cleric
taking 4 50% resses in a night? If I was that cleric I'd start finding
other things to do during those raids like getting a root canal or
something.
