Well, there is no breastplate that drops there I am familiar with that a
cleric would be especially interested in. The two tunics I know of are the
gnomeskin tunic (which is strictly a fashion accessory, and a mediocre
piece of poison resist gear), and the beer stained coldain tunic (which is
ok, but hardly awe-inspiring). Those only drop on level 3+ (the coldain
tunic on level 5) There is some good stuff on the upper levels, and the
coin is pretty good lower down.

>What should I know about this place before I head in ( in about 1.5 hours

>Any unmezzable Mobs?  Traps?  Locked doors that will get me killed?

Nothing you will be seeing will be unmezzable...if anything is unmezzable,
it wouldn't appear until level 6+, and no way a group of low 30s will be
going there. There is 1 trap on the first floor, which spawns several of
the skeletons. Not much in the way of locked doors, but there are "locked"
mirrors which teleport you to the next level up. Each level has a special
mob which drops the key to take you to the next level. Level 4 has a locked
door leading to the passage to the exit mirror, but that is about it.

>4 of the others have been playing together for 2 years, so know about the
>place, but I'm new to it.  Any pre-information is appreciated.

Best advice: don't die above level 1. The keys up are NOT soulbound, and it
can take a long, long time to get back to your bodies with no keys and no
gear. Have a higher level friend with a full set of keys available to get
your group back up. Probably a group at your level will not go any higher
than the 2nd level, so it shouldn't be a huge hardship.
