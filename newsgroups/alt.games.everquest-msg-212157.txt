Did you ever have a fish (angels are notorious) that was just mean?  Fin
nipping .... bullying ... sometimes even killing other fish in the aquarium
outright?

That's where the aquarium analogy breaks down.  While you created the
environment, you didn't create the fish ... if you had, you probably
wouldn't have created a fish who seems to enjoy destroying all the other
fish you created.  Folks who are creationists believe that their 'force of
good' created the whole shooting match ... the tank, the water, the filters
and pumps, and all of the fish.  When you view your surrounding with through
that filter, a 'force of evil' is how the mean fish is accounted for.  The
'force of good' certainly wouldn't have created it on purpose, so the 'force
of evil' corrupted it.

Yin and yang.
