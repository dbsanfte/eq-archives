Feh!

Nothing beats the old fire elemental model!

Remember, I have to see these guys almost every
minute I'm on.  Of course, part of my dislike was
based on the fact that their fighting animations

<grumble>  But I've come to be addicted to sitting
mana regen at all times, so I have no choice but
to get used to them.
