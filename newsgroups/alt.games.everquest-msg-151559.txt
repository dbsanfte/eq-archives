You're kidding, right?  This is a busy person, too busy to play for a few
weeks or so, he finally gets a couple hours free (kids at a neighbors or
whatever)... and the first thing he does is go to a fansite (Assuming he
even knows where one is?) and spends 20 minutes searching for old patch
messages to read...  when he doesn't even know for sure there was a patch.

Heh.  Kind of like going out and finding an incredible new game, so you buy
it, rush home, install it....  and then stop, sit down and read the
instruction book cover to cover? ; )

Most people will just want to play, and figure they will be able to pick up
most of the important things as they go along.
