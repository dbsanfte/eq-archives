From time to time (3 or 4 times per night, I guess) when I zone, I
suddenly have this really horrible lag (1 frame per 4 sec or so, bad
enough to render the game unplayable.) It goes away if I log all the way
out of EQ and restart it (dropping back to character select or server
select won't do it); but I'm getting kind of fed up with having to do
that so often. Anyone know what causes this and how to fix it? System
has plenty of RAM (512mb) and a Geforce card so I don't think it's
really a hardware problem.
