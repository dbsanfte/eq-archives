    No, he got it right. Read it carefully: increase the rate at which ONE
melee character does damage, and the GROUP's increase in kill rate is small.
Increase the primary healer's mana regen rate, and the group's total
downtime recovery rate goes up by pretty much that much (unless you have
multiple healers - even then, ever had more than two in an XP group?)

    To use harder numbers: in a group of four tanks, each doing about the
same DPS, and two "healers" sharing the load. Give ONE a haste item, 100%
for ease of calculation. The group's DPS has gone up 25%, with a
commensurate damage taken reduction of 20%. The group could pull 20% faster
/ take mobs that do 20% more damage and still "keep up". Now give ONE of
those healers a mana regen item that hastes mana regen by 100%. You now have
50% greater healing power, and can up the pulls by 50% and not overload the
healers.

    The reason you may read it backwards is because you assume implicitly
that (a) ALL melees will get the haste items in question for the exact same
effort that all healers would get such mana regen items, (b) you're used to
the intentionally skewed system where a 20% melee haste item is trivial to
buy in EC but a 20% mana regen haste item, as yet, exists only as a GM event
item (and that staff is in the 33% to 50% haste range - capped med rate is
30 per tick, no?), and (c) you're used to fighting mobs where the single
best method over time that healing classes have to heal with, slowing, has
been coded to not work. But even for your level of play - ever notice that
all the right-clickable damage items (hasting total damage output by
extending mana pool) are the same as when first created, but almost every
right-clickable healing item (hasting total healing output by extending mana
pool) has been nerfed to hell and gone?

    Give me a few pre-nerf Donal's BPs and I'll REALLY make your encounter
trivial. 8)

    Some guilds. Some, like BoTS, went to NToV before going to Sleeper's. I
agree with you on what order they should have done things in, but they did
do it. And a point - how many of those guilds went out and got an upgrade
for their casters (DB) at the same time?

>Flowing thought is largely a bone tossed to casters.

    Agreed. Because if a general mana regen item was available that actually
worked like the melee items worked, we'd hand them to healers and watch
fights become trivial. Imagine an item that made the standing med rate equal
the sitting med rate to get some idea of what the original poster was
wondering "why aren't these in game?" And the answer there is simple - an
item like that would what, add 50% mana over the course of one of those ten
minute fights?

    Totally agreed. On the subject: know where there's some hard numbers on
how often Specialization kicks in, and what the decrease in mana cost is
like when it does kick in? One of those "Luclin skills" increases how often
Specialization kicks in, and I wanted to try and translate that into hard
percent mana cost reductions to get some idea of how useful they might be.
