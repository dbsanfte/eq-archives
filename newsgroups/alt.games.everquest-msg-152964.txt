You can't use OE over a telnet connection.

Ok, so it's not a big deal to most, but it's a determining factor in my 
newsreader choice, since otherwise I'd spend half my life installing and 
configuring newsreaders and trying to figure out where I left my .newsrc 
file. :) 

I also doubt you can use OE under VMS or IRIX, but I could be wrong.
