The route that my family took, pre-Luclin was Oasis, North Karana/South 
Karana.  Then Luclin came in and on to Dawnshroud Peaks.  Of course Rathe 
Mountains fits in there too. You may have outgrown Oasis already.  North 
Karana is best with a tracker.  So perhaps South Karana would work with your 
groups where you start at the southern Aviak camp and then move north to the 
gnolls.
