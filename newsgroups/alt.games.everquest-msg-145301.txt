Mobs certainly do stop following you and wander off.  You do stay on their
hate list, and they will respond to you with a larger aggro range in the
future, but they do give up.  Mobs in Velious in particular are very
polite about this, I suppose the cold climate makes them conserve
energy better... but specific mobs like wurms in SF also exhibit very short
follow distances as well.

I assume you have parked your pet at your fight spot, not taken it with you
to go pull.  To run out an unwanted aggro without getting your pet on it...
don't run close to your pet!

Its certainly one I've used with a fair degree of success, any time I'm
faster than the mobs on any character.  Do you think my bard uses
FD, Root, or fear?  Well he could use fear, but I can tell you he doesn't,
he simply outruns mobs.  TBoots or SOW in a bottle aren't as
fast as a bard, you say?  Aha, but my bard rarely uses selo, TBoots
are the bomb!

Yes and no.  A monk, after all, can simply FD adds.  A monk doesn't
pull from five miles away.  While I imagine you do know how it
works better than the average player, its not because you are a monk,
its because you've been paying attention.

They may be popular, but as a mage you'd be a fool to think they are
better for you.  You need to play your class, not some generic "this
is the best way" plan.  Mages need single pulls with no adds.  We've
established that.  So don't screw around with situations where an
add isn't just a hazard, but a guarantee!

So you learn.  Yep, -while learning- you may have to ditch pet, which
will be a pain as previously demonstrated.  But very little exp work is
done by roaming around trying this spot and that spot.  Despite the
dreams of Brad, most play consists of finding a good spot and sticking
with it.  So you blow a few pets finding your next sweet spot, then you
spend a couple days working it correctly.

Why on earth are you trying to go solo in a zone with A) undead so your invis
won't work and B) SOW speed mobs, so your TBoots won't work?  This
looks like a screaming example of my claim that if you are going to solo, you
need to pick a good spot for your class, not some generic sweet spot!

Second, What are you, a melee?  Bound in FV?  Are you mad?  Bind near
your fight spot!  When travelling long distances over risk terrain, bind
periodically at safe spots.  Bind Affinity, its not just for buff beggars who
don't like soulbinders!  As a bonus, you can run the mobs off out of follow
range of your gate spot, then gate back to near your fight spot and go
back to work.  Gate from far enough away and you zone, clearing aggro
completely!  If you stay bound in FV, your theory that running away
doesn't solve anything does hold a lot more water, I'll grant you.

You forgot Flash of Light, Stun, Atone... yep, clerics are a good deal
better at ditching aggro than mages are, I'll grant you that.  Like monks
are  a good deal better than clerics at it.  But unlike a monk, all those
methods take mana and risk me stopping to apply them, and require that
the mobs not resist.  Cross a high level zone while a low level cleric and
guess what, its "beat feet or be meat" just as sure as the mage.  Not getting
the add in the first place is vastly superior.

They grey in several spots around the perimeter.  SS along the wall which
includes OT, over most of its length.  Near the zone line in almost any
outdoor zone.  Most of the coast of EW.  Much of the coast of WW.
Cobalt Scar on the beach, assuming you aren't KOS to otters.  Frankly,
in almost every outdoor zone there are spots free of roamers, and as
we've discussed, its worth finding them.

Never, of course, doesn't exists, since there is always the possibility
that someone will deliberately or accidentally train you, or die near
you and their mobs will wander over.  The game is never going to
be free of risk from the stupidity or deliberate malice of others.

If you hunted 5 hours with no adds, then you already know perfectly
well what I'm talking about.  Yes, Shyt happeneth.  But its far from
the norm, you weren't unable to get and hold what I'd say is a sub optimal
camp for a mage.  Next time bind in a better spot so it doesn't take so
long to get back.  Oh and you'll only have to summon your pet once, thats
been fixed (now hope they fix the fix and you get your Best pet instead of
always getting a mediocre one)

Zero doesn't exist, but there are certainly tons of spots where properly played
there's zero chance of an add if you are the only person in the zone.  I'm
not sure that there is such a spot in BW thats anywhere convenient to hunt from,

but A) thats risk versus reward, if you WANT to pull everything to the
SF zone line despite it taking five minutes to get each mob, that would lower
your risk, if you WANT faster pulls you have to accept the occaisional
(rare) add and B) We've discussed that BW is probably not your best
zone to work in.

Thats certainly true.  But I do know that I can fight in spots where I get
no roamer adds and very rarely get adds while pulling, at any level
of the game, because I've done it.  From 44 on I soloed my cleric
at least half of each level, and it wasn't because I was parking adds,
it was because I found zones and mobs and spots where I could
work without adds most of the time (and I'd count one in five
hours as just fine)  Further, my druid soloed almost exclusively from
1 to 34, and again, fought single mobs, pulled alone, dragged to a
 no aggro area and killed alone.   Adds can be dealt with, but the
best way of doing so is to not get them in the first place.  A mage,
it seems to me, would merely be more fanatical about such things
than any of my characters ever had to be.
