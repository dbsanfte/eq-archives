Dark elf cleric of innoruk getting good faction with surefall glade
protectors of the pine, druid rings.

After trying to figure this out from Allakhazams, where it is somewhat
ambiguous, I finally got that jagged pine treefolk are the regular
druid npcs at the NK ring while Protectors of the Pine are ranger ones
like Holly Windstalker.  These are the same in surefall also.

There is one thing I don't get though, protectors of the pine is at
threaten (the ranger people like holly and in surefall) and I got
jagged pine treefolk to glower dubious finally but who the hell are
the two NPCs at the WC ring? They are SCOWL so either they are not on
either of these factions or they require a higher faction to be in
good with them?

I noticed something similar on my wood elf druid who has always had
good faction with the nk ring (jagged pine) and protectors of the pine
from doing quests when she was low level around qeynos. Even to HER,
those 2 at the WC ring are only indifferent. What the heck faction are
they ON? I'm not talking about the vendor lady whom I know is on beta
neutral.

Oh, and does someone know a better way for a dark elf cleric of
innoruk to get to non kos with protectors in surefall also ( for fun
and so I can get ports there easily.. now that channel port on my
server is so useful ;)  ) Let me detail the easiest way that seems
apparent to me:

Get a bunch of poachers heads from toxula (more poachers than in
surefall by the bears) get the one use halfling form mask from the
innitiate quests, go to surefall and wait until a druid is in the zone
who can camo me, ask if they would help with the quest, use the
halfling mask, go and hand 4 poacher heads to the ranger guild guy
then have the druid camo me before I turn them in = Indifferent and he
accepts them (halfling form still only gets me to dubious with
protectors) 

Yeah, wolf form would do the same thing in fact it might even raise
the faction another step to where the invis trick is not needed.. but
the difference is that a 4th level or whatever druid can camo me for
cash while it takes a higher level druid to be around to share wolf
form.

I just did this successfully with 2 poacher heads as a test, with a
level 10 druid who happened by. Hand heads, druid camos me, indiff con
now, complete trade.

So my idea was to get a huge ton of poacher heads to make it worth it
to also have the halfling mask again. According to allakhazams and
other research I did there is no kill that raises protectors of the
pine. I did find out that if I raise jagged pine more I could do
something like nestiffs deliveries from the druids in surefall but I
have to use a 10 plat invis potion to get close enough each time while
watching out for the lady in surefall who is a blue con and runs
around on protectors faction (No doubt the druids would assist her if
she attacked me also) Plus I heard that quest is not that big of a
faction raise.

Anyone have other ideas or know more than allakhazams does?
