I am an active member of an all women, good races only guild on Druzzil Ro.

We have had the same problem that you are currently facing, all our high lvl
members leaving for the so called uber guilds. About 6 months back for some
reason this all started to change, we can now mount a raid on the Arena in
Kael Drakkel quite successfully ( with some help from friends and those that
left for the bigger guilds though ). The key to our success I believe is the
fact that most of our members prefer to stay true to the friendships that
have been made in the guild. We still accept lvl 10 and up as new members
but they have to be sponsored into the guild and then after a 2 week
probation the officers decide if the member concerned is of a type that we
want in the guild.

Our reputation on Druzzil has grown over the last 6 months that we can ask
for and receive help from the big guilds on a regular occasion. Most of our
members have at least 2 in the guild and we are organizing raids for the
lower lvls, with some of the high lvls along to help if it gets scary. We
have 2 clerics in the 50's and myself lvl 47. Occasionally one of our
members will deguild themselves so they can go on a raid with another guild
but when it is all over they come straight back into the fold. This way they
can share their experiences and help us when we do a big raid.

The main thing is all exp's help with our guild and we are happy when a
sister goes into another guild for a raid, in the long run it strengthens
our guild.


Sorry if this was long winded ))

Regards

Bonemend Roseshield
lvl 47 cleric
