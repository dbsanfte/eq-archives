Since putting ETP in my killfile, he hasn't been a problem at all.

The ONLY problem has been people like you, people who for whatever reason,
just have to reply and x-post, so we end up seeing the crap we already set
our newsreader to ignore.

Its less effort to KF him than to reply to him... and i GUARANTEE it has
better results.   You don't piss off a stack of people either by taking the
KF approach.

Yes, im well aware I myself just x-posted this...  but the message wasn't
getting across from other people who have said it..

Killfiles are your friends.   Dip shit spammers are not your friends.  Stop
replying, stop threatening them, add them to your killfile, and if needs be,
report them to their ISP.

Problem solved... it really can be that simple.
