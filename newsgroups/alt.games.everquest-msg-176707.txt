There was a nerf a little before PoP came out, so that Harmony won't work on
mobs above 40th level, but there's an 'upgrade' called Harmony of Nature
that's single target, higher casting cost, and a little less reliable.
Simultaneously they upgraded the Enchanter/Cleric/Paladin Lull line

However, since the last patch (1/15) there is a NEW bug in the Lull line for
Enchanter/Clerics/Paladins, which I assume affects Harmony as well

Simply put, Harmony will not work for you till they fix the bug. You can go
Harmony a group of level 1 rats and it won't stick.

The problem is that now (apparently) instead of checking the target's level
to see if the spell can work on it, the spell checks the caster's level.

Since you are above 40, it will always fail.

This has been verified by a 55 paladin, using pacify (55 cap), ding, next
try it's resisted (pally is now 56) pally suicides to 55, spell works on
mobs that it just failed on. get rez and a little xp, ding 56, same thing,
Pacify no longer works.

I checked on Test last night, this bug appears to still be in effect there
(they have not fixed it yet).
