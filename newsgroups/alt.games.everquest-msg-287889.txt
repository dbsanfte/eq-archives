I think the "greyed out" was referring to the respawn window.
Here's how that works these days:

When you die, your viewpoint stays at your corpse for a while.
(You usually can't change the camera angle, but you can hear stuff
going on nearby and your chat window may show continuing battle if
there are others still fighting.)  You get a "respawn window" that
shows your choices, which are:

1) Reappear at your bind location.
2) Resurrect and reappear at your corpse.

There's also a timer ticking down, and when it runs out you will
automatically reappear at your bind location (choice 1).

The second choice is greyed out until someone actually casts a
resurrection spell on your corpse.  If someone DOES cast it, and
you accept the resurrection, then the second respawn choice goes
green and you can select it and click the button to reappear where
your corpse was.  You still have all the usual downsides of having
died and resurrected -- "rez sickness" debuff, etc.  The only real
difference between this vs popping to your bind point and then
popping back when someone casts the resurrection, is that you don't
have to zone twice, provided the resurrection is cast before the
respawn window timer runs out.

As JimP says, even though you keep your gear now when you die and
reappear at your spawn point, you do still lose experience, so you
want to get someone to rez your corpse to get back (most of) the xp.
To do that, you need the corpse.  You can either run and find it
like in the good old days (and bring a cleric or other rezzer with
you; a healer-type mercenary for instance), or pay to have the
corpse magically transferred to the Guild Lobby, where you can
usually find a cleric willing to rez you.
