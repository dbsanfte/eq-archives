I've had fun playing a Necro from 1-40, but find myself playing my Cleric
more frequently these days.

Necros are arguably the best overall solo class in the game. They also have
little to no reason to worry about faction, since most of the world wants
them dead anyway. They pay for that freedom, however, with having a limited
role in most group/raid situations. Pound for pound, they do every bit as
much damage as a wizard(more if pet damage is factored in), but they do it
over 60 seconds where the Wizard does it instantly. Prepare to do a lot of
walking as a Necro, unless you have friends that are Wizards and Druids.

Wizards can solo, but it's tougher for a Wizard than a Necro until very high
levels. Wizards get ports at 20-ish and group ports at 30-ish, but the pet
they get at high levels will never compare to a Necro pet. They also have a
more useful role in groups, due to high DD spels and ports. Wizards can be
fun to play, but they're also one-trick ponies. Direct Damage, Direct
Damage, Ports. That's a Wizard in a nutshell.

If you happen to be playing on one of the PvP servers, both Wizards and
Necros do very well.

Personal preference is the best gauge in this game. Play them both for
awhile, to level 12 or so,  and see which suits you more.
