 They answered my /petitions on the day it happened and the day after.
That to me said they were aware of the problem. I had to make a
further problem to get them to understand the seriousness of it.

 I eventually got the item back But pissed off the PoK. Luckily the
raid leader and another group member were on when the gms contacted
me. Boy where the ninjalooters friends pissed. Came into pok and
started shouting at how I was a crybaby and I didn't deserve the item
cause I couldn't solo the mob myself. Nevermind the fact the nl
couldn't either. Or I was there almost 3x as long as the nl.
