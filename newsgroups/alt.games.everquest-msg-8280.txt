I'll help out again Biz (I feel your pain),

If you have the Nature Walker's Behest spell. What mob dropped it and in
which zone? I would like to focus my hunting on targets that definitely drop
this particular spell.

If you do not have the spell, or first-hand knowledge of which mob dropped
it in which zone, please move on to the next thread.
