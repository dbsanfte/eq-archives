Hehe, I very much agree, and I think monk powerleveling would be the best
idea, and I DO have access to a level 60 monk.. My monk is only level 22
though, and I don't really want to put the level 60 monk in a position where
I would get it killed because I pulled too much and didn't know what each of
the skills are.. although I can always just feign.  I think i'll go with the
monkey way.  Ok, off to get my druid higher :)
