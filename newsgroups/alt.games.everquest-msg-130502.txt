17 might be a level too low, but at 18 you could do the aviak guards in lake
rathe. Try the double spawn near the arena zone. Just dont kill any of the
small aviaks ("an aviak") else you will get faction hits. The aviak guards
have no hits. In the meantime, other options are gnolls and stuff south of
the bridge in EK, or maybe the basilisks in RM. The trick with basilisks is
to just let them pumel you while your dots and pet kills them.
