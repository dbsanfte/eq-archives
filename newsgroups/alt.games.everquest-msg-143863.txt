And how do you justify posting "I am the Lord your God, you shall have
no other God before me." in a court that is charged with giving a fair
trial to, oh let's say a Hindu?  You think they might not feel just a

questions of law, the judge who posts the Decalogue is making a personal
declaration of partiality.
