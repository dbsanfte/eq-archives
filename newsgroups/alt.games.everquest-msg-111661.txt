*A long line of somber warriors playing violins shows up to express
their sorrow over the plight of the clerics with their twice a week pop.

We may as well. Sev pops once a week, (if you're lucky, depending on
patches) requires an A-bomb strike force compared to Ragefire, and
*MIGHT* drop the green scales if you are unfuckingbelievably lucky. And
every other guild on the server that's capable of doing him still wants
him even if they don't need the scales.

At least they made an *effort* to adjust the Ragefire scenario. It's
doubtless better (in some ways) then when we had to camp in Naggy's lair
for days on end.  Not perfect, but compared to several other epics,
including the warriors and the mages, to start with, you really have
very little to complain about, IMO.
