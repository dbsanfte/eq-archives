First off Invis is useless in SolB as a Cleric you might get by at 35ish in
the front areas but I don't think you can handle the Kings room yet. If you
see any Bats Spiders Imps or Elementals RUN for your life. Kobolds are good
exp decent cash and vendor items at 40ish you will have enough mana to make
a trip to the Kings room and depending on your group maybe the spider area.
Efferti room will take a group of 50s to break in can be held with 3 or 4
once the spawn is split (3 mid 40s) and timed but you will need to be ported
out.
