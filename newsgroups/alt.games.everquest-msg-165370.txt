    Then you should have been the one challenging those figures. You know
what standing mana recovery is, you know what sitting med rate is - do the
math! Blindly accepting what others tell you when you should know better is
weak.

    Unreasonable as compared to what? An enchanter's haste spell has the
same effect on a melee. By dealing 1.6 times as much damage with 60% haste
(assumed no haste item), the melee takes 1/1.6 = 62.5% the damage they were
taking before, and thus kill stuff at 60% greater rate. What you object to
is how a caster can get C3 and go do something for a long time, as opposed
to the melees that need to second box a haster for the same efficiency.

    Sometimes I wonder if Verant has programmers, too.
