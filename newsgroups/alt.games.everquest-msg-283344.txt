Been away from the game for maybe 8 months or so, still not sure whether 
  I'm going to start playing again, but I decided to go ahead and let 
the patcher run.

Looks like about 50 minutes of download at DSL speed; I'm not sure where 
I stopped buying expansions, probably OOW or GOD; whichever the last one 
was before I quit, I didn't buy that one, but did buy the one before.

Course from another comment here on AGE it looks like I picked the 
perfect day to do this... did they just release a new patch?

Anyway, I thought while I waited perhaps I'd ask if there was a free 
monthly trial offer or something that I could take advantage of to 
experiment and see if I want to return for real.

If not, well, I might do it anyway, its really not that much to pay for 
a month, and with the incredible lack of interesting software for the PC 
available these days, my "gaming" budget isn't really a concern.
