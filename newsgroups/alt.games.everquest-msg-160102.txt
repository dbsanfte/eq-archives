I don't worry about it either, but my wife's a bit more .. um .. competitive
than I am.  She must be doing something right, she has over 120,000pp in the
bank, and this is after spending another 100K on rare spells.  And she still
gives me grief about not having autosplit on when we group.

What boggled my mind was that the guy was selling them for less than it cost
him to make them...
