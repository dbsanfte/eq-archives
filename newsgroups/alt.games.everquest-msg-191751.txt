Almost anyone I see under 60 in pov/pos I want to beat in the face.

Exp in pon/pod/poi is fine til 61+, and for casters in particular, most of
their spells will get resisted a lot since pov/pos mobs are around level 60
or higher for the most part. Melee are less disabled since they can hit red
mobs a lot easier than an enchanter can mez yellows.
