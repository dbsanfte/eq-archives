Assuming you can connect to the internet at all after SP2 there should
be no problem with EQ. (EQ has never had a problem with firewalls to
my knowledge.) However being able to connect to the internet at all is
going to be the problem.

I'd like to preface this by saying that most people that install SP2
have no problems what so ever, and it closes most if not all of the
~known~ security flaws that XP has. It also has some nice features to
remove all the crap spyware/adware/malware that is flying around the
net these days.

However...

I get at least one call a day where SP2 has hosed someoneï¿½s computer.
Sometimes it's the installation makes the entire computer unbootable,
or other significant non-internet specific problem. However most of
the calls I get (seeing is how I do tech support for DSL) about SP2
have to do with the computer working fine except for the internet
connection.

It may be a problem caused by having spyware in the commstack when
installing the SP2, or just simply bad coding by Microsoft. In some
occasions SP2 will prevent you from surfing the internet, or will
cause intermittent problems of the same type. In most cases it seems
that even turning off the firewall in SP2 does not fix the problem.
However the SP2 can normally be uninstalled without a problem, if the
SP2 installation seems to have gone wrong. Uninstalling it fixes the
problem in almost all cases.

As for myself, I keep my computer clean, I'm very careful about where
I go on the internet and what I download. I don't really see a reason
to install SP2 on my computer. I think people who are at least fairly
security conscious will not ~need~ the SP2 patch. (Though it was
mostly intended for the majority of computer users who don't have the
faintest clue about how to keep their computer clean on the internet.)
