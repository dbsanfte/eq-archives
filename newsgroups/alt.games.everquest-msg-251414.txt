Hey Lance,
	On a side question... I was thinking of starting a bard... for
the experience of just saying I've done it.  When do you feel that
they come into their own.  That is when do they start being able to
solo like you describe above?  I often hear of and see bards running
in circles with several mobs in tow.  I am not sure but I belive it is
called swarm kiting?
	So, when does this wonderful skill / fun start?
