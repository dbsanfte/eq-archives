There are two ways they can do it.  One way is to do it right, with
the server keeping track of it.  That would be nice.  Meanwhile,
there's a way they can do it quick, with about 10 minutes of
programmer time, client side only.

1. Add a command "/raidchannel N", where N is a number.  Default is 0.

2. Add a command "/raidsay" to speak on the raid channel.  This
actually sends on the /auction channel, with your message prefixed by
"N:", where N is your current raidchannel setting.

3. When the client receives anything on /auction, it checks for an N:
prefix.  If there is none, it is a /auction, and is handled according
to your auction settings.  If there is an N: prefix, that is compared
to your raidchannel setting.  If it matches, display the message,
prefixed by something to indicate it is a raid channel message.  If N
does not match, drop the message.

Send them this suggestion, and ask them to implement the quick way
now, and then do the right way later.
