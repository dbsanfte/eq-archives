Hi,

My Wizard just make it into level 39, and I have a question about one
of his new spells..

He does a lot of solo work... so he usually Roots a given target, casts
Bonds of Force on it, and then nukes it over and over with Shock spells.

My question is this, what level of Root spell should he be using for
this type of "root and nuke" style combat?  His level 4 Root spell, or
the new level 39 Immobilize Spell?

Is the Immobilize spell any more (or less) likely to break when it is
nuked than Root is?

I think that Immobilize is supposed to have a faster casting time than
Root, as well as a longer potential duration.

I am just wondering which of these two spells other Wizards have found
to be better suited for "root and nuke" tactics?

Many Thanks,

 - Mike Dorr
