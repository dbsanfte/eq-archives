My level 48 mage is wearing a crystalline leggings and belt simple because
he never got round to getting some decent stuff for those slots. Some common
items for your necro are probably Stein of Moggok, Sapphire necklace, PBB's,
(that belt from LGuk), frozen mantle (yes it sucks, no there aren't many
easy items instead of this one) and int earrings and rings.
The initital stat enhancers for casters are almost all in the non-armor
slots. All the better armor is almost always no drop or very hard to get.
The Flayed Skin is rather crap as well. I offered the leggings to a nearby
necro and he asked me why he should want it...

The fbr is .. nice. Might go for an Advisor, Oracle or Crystalline Robe.
Also get a black tome with silver linings (sp?) for the main hand (Stein in
off).
For the arms there is the Gatorscale Sleeves. No competition until plane
gear.

Nothing I can think of more at the moment, but probably others can help more
:)
