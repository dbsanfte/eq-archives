Got very lucky with getting a group last night.  I logged in, was sitting in
EC for not even 5 minutes when I see a group forming 53-59, sent a tell to
the guy asking if he wanted a 55 Beastlord and he said yes, we formed up and
got a mission.  Only mission available was a rescue my friend deally, didn't
sound great but we took it anyway.

We had planned to buff just outside the zone before entering to cut some
time off, but had no warning and.......Entering Drudge Circle or something
like that.  So we started pulling as I summoned my pet, got shrink up,
buffed, etc.  Group was made up of a Paladin, Cleric, Enchanter, Druid,
Ranger and Beastlord (me).  Was pretty much a perfect group, and everyone
was doing well.  Enchanter pulled his cleric on prior to going in and
Virtued everyone so that helped a lot.

We tore through mobs really quickly and took only about 2 wrong turns.

First....good impressions....the dungeon looked awesome.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE
the new orc models.  They are much more brutish and mean looking, the way I
expect orcs to look.  Had two Augments drop, one +5 INT item that went to
the Enchanter of course and a +5 SvM that I won the roll on.  Decent loot,
though I'm unsure what to do with the goblin bones and a couple other items
that dropped.  Wouldn't vendor for much so I figured I'd save them till I
found a potential use for them.  No tradeskill tag on them either... but I
digress.

Bad impressions.  The time limit was not nearly enough.  I think even if we
had for some reason known the exact route to take with the speed we were
killing mobs being rather quick in my estimation (though the CHealing orcs
were a pita sometimes, resisting stuns and all) the timer ran out before we
even found the NPC we were supposed to rescue and that was only by pacifying
6-7 mobs on the last bit, then trying to kill them on the way out (this was
while the extra 30 minutes was still going) we STILL didn't make it even
close to zone with her.

Lessons learned in hindsight, one, no more rescue missions.  Two, gonna
automap a pathline on the way in next time we do anything of the sort so we
know the way out next time.

All in all though, really enjoyed the time.  Got about 10%xp and about 120pp
and one Augment, so was fun regardless of the failure.
