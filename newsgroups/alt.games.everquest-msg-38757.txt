In the first place, it isn't ME.  I have a level 46 druid.  OK, not
ultra-high, but high enough to be negatively rather than positively
affected by TCC.  I have my gator legs.  I have thousands in the bank.
I am arguing on behalf of the mid and low level, not as one of them.

You're totally wrong about what I want, I'll get to that in a minute,
but tell me, what's fair about killing a GREEN mob for loot that you
turn around and sell to someone of lower level who has much LESS than
you do?

Oh wait, I forgot, there are no farmers, right?  So you can swear that
every last copper piece in your bank account came off a blue or higher
mob?  You've never ever sold something you got off a green mob to
someone lower level than you, right?

Now, as to what I want.  I don't give a damn about your money.  I too
have been playing since release and I don't want things any easier.
What I WANT is for more people to go to the dungeons.  I think it's
sad that you zone into Runnyeye and there are only one or two people
there (high levels killing green stuff, of course).

On my server, Paw is full of people, every night.  People who can get
experience there.  So if you zone into Paw, you have a very good
chance of finding a pickup group.  Runnyeye is empty, though.

I think there's a sort of feedback phenomenon going on here.  Runnyeye
is empty because people know no goes there, so they won't be able to
find a group, so no one goes there.  Paw is full because people think
they have a good chance of finding a group, so they go there.

The reason I support TCC is that I think it will give a boost to those
deserted places.  I don't agree that all of these places are so badly
broken that no one will ever go there, no matter what you do.  Sure,
some are.  Others aren't.  Verant screws up, but not always.  And some
zones would become a LOT easier if there were a tradition of people
going there, keeping things under control.  Not every dungeon is a
death trap.

And what I hear here is the sniveling of a priveleged class about to
lose its priveleges.  Waah, waah, waah.
