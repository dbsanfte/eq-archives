95,98 and me have a microsoft stated ram limit of about 1.3 gig for
best usage or something. 

The microsoft knowledge base article talks about how if you have 512
meg or more of ram you will want to limit the disc cache size since
the disc cache can get quite large using up all memory addresses
otherwise. There is a memory address limit of like 800 meg for those
OS's and you reach that number by adding in how large the disc cache
gets on to your agp apeture size. 

So, for that reason if you had say 768 meg of ram and a 256 meg agp
apeture size, you'd want to set a disc cache limit so that the size of
the disc cache plus the 256 was not = to or greater than 800 or so.

The thing is, you DON'T WANT your disc cache to get that large. Disc
cache is where recently used files or files which are being used a lot
are swapped into your REAL system memory instead of coming off the
hard disc. The problem is that if you have say 512 meg of ram and your
disc cache gets as large as 135 meg while running Everquest you
basically have 135 meg of system ram which you are not using to run
the game in the best way possible. 

Cacheman has good presets for setting up the disc cache min and maxxed
size basedupon your amount of ram and the use of the machine (for
instance on check box says "mostly gaming") 

www.outertech.com

They also explain disc cache much better than I did:

"Disk Cache 

Disk Cache is a part of RAM that acts as an intermediate buffer when
data is read from and written to storage devices. 

The Disk Cache driver stores the most recently accessed data in RAM.
When a program needs to access new data, the operating system first
checks to see if the data is in the cache before reading it from the
disk. Because computers can access data from RAM much faster than from
a storage device, disk caching can significantly increase performance.

What's the problem with the Windows 9x-ME Disk Cache? 

There is no problem with the Disk Cache itself, but Windows 9x-ME can
often gobble up 80% of your installed memory for the Cache. It does
not hurt if you still have enough free RAM, but should this be not the
case - the increased usage of Virtual Memory will decrease system
performance by a significant amount. Cacheman will help you set the
Disk Cache limits for your system and if necessary gain more free
memory."

Of course you don't NEED cacheman to do it and can do it manually in
your system.ini as cacheman did for my 384 meg ram here:

[VCache]
MinFileCache=9216
MaxFileCache=13312

It wanted to set it for like 26 meg but I pushed it back to 13 meg to
free up even more. You can also play with it, like i set it to a limit
of 96 meg and after running EQ cacheman showed that it indeed did go
up to 96 meg of disc cache. I did not notice any better perforamance
in EQ though, so I figure its better to have as much ram freed up as
possible instead of caching recent files needlessly.
