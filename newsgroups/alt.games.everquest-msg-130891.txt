Sorry, Rumble... but Luclin pretty much destroyed Druid/Wizzies porting for
cash to newbie cities

Newbie Cities...
Erudin/Paineel... Odus/Luclin Port vs Tox Ring... no market
Qeynos/Hallas... NK/Luclin vs Surefall Ring... slight market, only for the
truly lazy :o)
Rivervale... no Luclin port vs Misty Thicket Ring... but then most Halflings
are druids anyway (j/k) ;o)
Freeport/Neriak... no Luclin port vs EC Ring (Or Lava Ring for DEs heading
to Neriak)... good market
Kaladim/Felwith/Kelethin... GFay/Luclin port vs BB Ring... no market
Cabilis... GD/Luclin port vs EJ port (closest but scary) or GD Ring... no
market
Grobb/Ogguk... no Luclin port vs Feerot ring... good market

PoP might affect business heading to Freeport/Neriak and Grobb/Ogguk... but
Freeport is just a boat ride away from the Luclin/Nexus system... and
Grobb/Ogguk is a 'hot LZ' for most Druids, meaning you don't need that kind
of business if it ends up in a CR for yourself :o)

Now if only there was a way to avoid "sow plz", I'd be able to take my Druid
off /roleplay for the first time since hitting 19 :o)
