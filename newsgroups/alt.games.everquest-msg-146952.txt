So what? If they choose an advertising regime that relies on pop ups that's
their choice. All pop ups on my machine are killed immediately, if I want
another window opened I will right click on a link and choose "open in new
window". I do not mind paying for content (I was a Allakh' member) but I
refuse to let someone elses jerkish in your face behaviour pay of for them
on <my> machine.

My right. If web publishers don't like it they better start coding better
and realising my wallet follows directly behind my attention span. If they
manage to piss me off within the small time I visit their site then the
chances of me opening my wallet for membership are exceedingly slim to say
the least....
