I think the only Ubisoft servers I have access to is Maelin Starpire. 
The other language servers aren't accessible to me since I live in the 
U.S. and I didn't buy New Dawn, besides, I really don't think I'll do 
well trying to communicate in French even though I took it for 4 years 
in high school.  Some people on Bertoxx speak French in /say sometimes 
and I try to figure out what they are saying, most of the time I can get 
the gist of it but not everything, I just don't have the vocabulary any 
more.
