    Heh, so Verant realizes that the original AAs were either so easy to
obtain for the power gamers, or so useless to the same, that people have the
time and desire to stockpile points in anticipation of PoP. I don't see why
they bother trying to slow down power gamers. Let them get to the end of
things fast if they want to do this! *They don't quit when they get to the
"end of the content" - they wait for you to make more next expansion because
they're horribly hooked on EQ.* The only practical reason I can see for
trying to delay people's progress is to hide an incomplete release until the
incomplete content is fixed. But considering they haven't been fast enough
yet for us to not notice this and call them on it, why would now be any
different?

    More crap to look at once, go "whatever", and turn off for 90% of my
time online. Even non-raid characters turn spell effects off, because a
higher-level XP grind session can look like a blinding fireworks display
with them turned on. I've got some nice pics of a group with a paladin,
bard, cleric, ENC and mage fighting a froglok wizard-type in Sebilis. You
can barely see the damned frog for all the particles flying around!

    Woo-hoo, BST! And it only took eleven months from when it should have
been done. ;-) Anyone yet know what the three class abilities are?

    Oh, I wish I could remember which discipline my guildmate was talking
about. One of our warriors is a real AA freak - he's over 120 now. He spent
points on one of the warrior Class-level AAs which has three levels, to
bring it to level 2. However, his parsing indicated this had no effect
whatsoever. So he petitioned it. The response from the GM (not guide, GM)?
"The description of the ability doesn't indicate it gets better with
additional levels, so why would you think it would?" I have to wonder if the
GM could keep a straight face when he typed that.

    Allow me to pre-congrats all the guilds that will kill things they never
killed before today. ;-)

    Does anyone know if elemental form made people appear naked when it
dropped? I'm curious about the use of the phrase "character type that can't
wear armor" as opposed to "character type which did not display worn armor".

    Thank you!!! Certain zones that are flagged as outdoors but which have
almost all content in an indoors area (VT) are really annoying when the only
forms of shrink available are potions and the VT shrink bracer.

    Oh, they did put in the new self-only +HATE buffs for Shadow Knights!
That should help them after the nerfs to their debuff hate.

    It's a sneaking suspicion amongst the high-end community that ALL skill
mods are currently non-functional. Since most would have small effects even
if working, this is difficult to prove. But Bind Wounds has an exact effect
for a given score in it, which is known to players and can be seen with
ease. Seeing that Bind Wounds skill mods were broken leads me to believe
that they're all broken, and Bind Wounds is being fixed because it's the
only one that anyone could prove was broken. Hopefully, the devs will also
think along the same lines and have the time to investigate if any mods that
haven't specifically been repaired are broken.

    Poor Chuck Tai, our standard Dire Charmed Chaktai Fungusbeast pet. We
used to give him two weapons that looked like mandolins when held and let
our "bard pet" go nuts on mobs. It wasn't just the Battle Axe that was
broken this way, though, and many other Luclin weapons appear as books and
other odd items when handed to a pet. I wonder if those other items were
also fixed.

> ** Horses **

    I wonder if they'll ever fix any of the "horse being attacked" bugs,
like the one Dan Day experienced recently.

    I'll have to go into the settings file and switch it manually to off,
then. If I cannot do this, I'll have to evaluate whether playing EQ and
feeling constantly motion sick is worthwhile. I imagine it won't be. :-( At
least my backlog of reading materials will finally go away! If it seems like
I'm being negative in the other areas, it's because of my extreme
disappointment that this is being forced on us.

> ** An Ancient Arises **

    New Sleeper's Tomb moved to all servers. Yay, I need to go get a key
now. I wonder if we'll accidentally also see the new Skyshrine, which was
supposed to be Legends-only and which went live today?
