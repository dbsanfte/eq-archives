All that does is show that the debt from the year before, plus the debt from
the next year, adds up to more.  Hardly an earthshaking revelation.

Look at some of the charts (very well done) at:

http://oregonstate.edu/Dept/pol_sci/fac/sahr/sumbudg.pdf

In particular, on page 3, National Government Spending in Billions of 2002
Dollars and as Percent of GDP, 1792 to 2002, which shows that spending
actually *hasn't* kept pace with the GDP.  Granted, I don't care for
inflation-adjusted figures, but there could be a large margin of error
before that graph would change perceptibly.

Another interesting chart appears on page 5, Inflation-adjusted Change in
National Government Budget Outlays by Presidential Term 1952 to estimated
2004, Percent.  Leading the pack, Kennedy, Johnson and Ford (reference
earlier in this thread the act passed that removed the president's ability
to control overspending).  In spite of Reagan being considered such a big
spender (and the "inflation-adjustment" having the least impact since the
years are consecutive), the figure under Carter's term is higher.

The chart that would be most informative is spending vs. taxes taken in, but
I haven't managed to track down those figures, just percentages and
extrapolations such as the resulting deficits.

In short, "there hasn't been a president in the last 50 years that could in
any way be considered fiscally responsible."  =)  They all spend to match
what's available.

Just one more comment, after I snip out a bunch of meaningless "soundbites". 
I especially enjoyed the "more federal debt was added than in the entire
prior history of the United States" which applies to every president since
Ike, but sure sounds good when you say it against a single president.  =)

Two things about this.  First, the economy moves like a whip (or, the more
common analogy, is like steering a ship).  What you do today changes the
economy in the next president's term.  Clinton's fiscal policy led directly
to the economic recession currently occuring.  Only now, four years in, can
the current economy really be considered to be a product of Bush's fiscal
policy, and is in fact improved over previous years (doesn't feel that way
to me yet, but that's what the figures say).  Second, Clinton was setting up
the economy for his "big plan" that would have increased federal spending to
unimagined heights.  He failed.  We can thank the republican congress for
defeating and re-defeating his nationalized health care system that would
have made Medicare spending look like peanuts.

The truth of the matter is, tax cuts will always benefit the wealthy to a
higher percentage.  Why is that?  Because we have a graduated tax system. 
The wealthy pay more taxes.  When there's an across-the-board tax cut, the
wealthy of course get a much bigger impact.  If I pay $5k in taxes, and the
guy making half a million a year pays $50k, and there's a 10% tax cut, it
reduces that $50k by $5k, but it doesn't reduce my $5k to zero.  To expect
that that's how it should work is bizarre and the ultimate in "entitlement"
thinking.

As the ship turns...   =)

I find, as a "lower middle class" American, that the economy often has
little real impact on my life.  I did not hurt more under Reagan, I did not
feel rich under Clinton, and other than gas prices I'm not in any worse
shape under Bush.  Whether that can be considered a win or a failure for any
president is hard to say.  More a statement on their actual relevance
probably.
