From the shadows, the mysterious "Andy" <Noone@Nowhere.com> (if that
IS his real name) conspiratorially whispered:

Cleric would be a poor choice as it doesn't add a hell of a lot other
than less downtime. Shaman and druid are good choices, shaman better
than druid. Enchanter leaves you with very little healing capability
and no matter how efficient you are eventually you will need to heal;
enchanters are best paired with druids or other casters. I don't know
how effective having a bard on autopilot would be even with a
programmable gamepad; it would almost be better to just let the bard
solo (swarm kiting) while the ranger leeches exp once they are even in
levels.

The best pairing for ranger, actually, is beastlord. By themselves
beastlords are awesomely powerful, but missing snare and fear, both of
which the ranger provides. You would never have any downtime and mobs
would die faster than any other combo.

It's not one of the better ones. If your guild has druids or bards or
monks or other good powerlevelers use those instead.
