Less than twice a week right now, though Verant have admitted the timer
is wrong - he currently pops roughly every 4.5 - 6 days.  Still,
they're too busy making sure no one has an easy way of raising Cabilis
faction right to fix that.

Couple of differences:

1) The warrior epic is easily outclassed by many Velious & Luclin weapons.
   Uberguilds just don't care for warrior epics any more.  The cleric epic
   is still considered essential.

2) Any guild capable of doing VP doesn't need Severilous anyway.

But I agree that it's still an ugly bottleneck.

It's *not* better in any way, apart from Verant's point of view.  They
were sick of all the petitions of KS'ing etc., so they made him an FFA
mob - now GM's can wash their hands of the quest.  This was *not* an
improvement from the clerics' point of view.  At least when you camped
in Sol B, you had some recourse if you were overrun.  Now you have
none.  Add to that the fact that you can now take Ragefire down *before
you have even started the quest*, and maybe you can begin to see how
badly messed up this is?

The cleric epic is one of the easiest epics in terms of the difficulty
of the encounters - it's BY FAR the worst in terms of being forced to
camp for days on end and being KS'd by larger guilds.
