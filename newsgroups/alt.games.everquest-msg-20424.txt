Its for the druid quest for the Beguile Plants spell.
Since the spell is just around worthless (can charm the cactii people, and
maybe treants), most druids dont want to bother getting it, especially since
one if the other items drop from one of the bad spiders. Its a level 29 spell,
but youre lucky to kill the spiders at 35, so apart from being rather useless,
most people dont wanna go hunt for spells thats too low when they can get them.

If you have a druid friend, give it to him, since only druids that WANT all
spells are interested in it.
