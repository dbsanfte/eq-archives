Well, I think it's like how some people who used to be drug or alcohol
abusers who quit and then become born again Christians and then turn
into real Bible thumpers.  It's like instead of constantly thinking

instead.

(of course, I'm not suggesting that every former drug addict turns
into a holy roller type)
