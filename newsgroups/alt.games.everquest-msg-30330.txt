Yes, I'm using a software router (Windows built-in ICS) to do the same
thing, share one external IP address with multiple PCs using NAT, but
you could also use a hardware cable-modem router or something to do the
same thing. Runs EQ fine.

The best tip I can give you is to check out
http://www.practicallynetworked.com

Many routers have built-in firewall capabilities. Be sure to open up the
UDP ports the EQ uses (they are listed in the FAQs on the Station, or
for ICS there is a utility, ICSconfig, and a settings file for EQ both
downloadable from the above URL).
