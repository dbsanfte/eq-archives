Nice comparison, but I'm an asshole, and the answer is yes.

That makes no sense.  UberTwinks have a bad habit of monopolizing highly
hunted areas, which pisses off the real newbies, they also have a habit of
attempting stuff to powerful for their twinkage (hmm... I wonder just HOW
red that orc is) and then either dumping it on a bunch of real newbies who
can't handle it, or begging a_high_level_08 to save their pathetic ass.

Or maybe you're just an idiot who can't figure out what to hunt; gee, I've
got a  fungi, so my level 3 monk can solo that spectre! .... OMG WTF IM
DEAD!!

Sure, I'll take 100k.  I have friends, and a decent guild, in fact, we're so
decent, we're more concerned with friendships and having fun than mindlessly
leveling, KSing Ragefire and mafiaing all the lesser people out of their
spawns.

Hahaha, you're even more of a moron than I thought at first.  I'll laugh
even more when the GM says no to you when you petition that you accidentally
destroyed your fungi.

Since you seem to like being stupid, may I suggest putting all of your
platinum on your mouse cursor, and clicking destroy and yes?
