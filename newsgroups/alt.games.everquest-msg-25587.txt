Well, If they want to level, they gotta hunt somewhere.  And at 29, 15pp
may be a good chunk of cash, OTOH, at 50+  150 gold is something you
drop on the ground because its making you encumbered.

OK, I have tremendous admiration for someone who goes to the trouble of
learning American English when it isn't their native tongue, but there
is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when
they
aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
