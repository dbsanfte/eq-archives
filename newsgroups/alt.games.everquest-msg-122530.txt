    Stealing the no-drop item is stupid - he can't get rid of a No Drop item
in any way that cannot be traced. Droppables, sadly, can be "washed", but
not No Drops.

    We learned this a short while ago when we had the Avatar of War
ninja-looted: always loot droppables off a corpse ASAP. If they are left on
the corpse, they will be stolen eventually. Our AoW thief knew every trick
in the book: right after he ninja'ed the stuff he suicided to a nearby giant
so there'd be the confusion of a fight and he wouldn't show on a /who. He
pulled the cord as he zoned after death, ensuring nobody could ask him if he
did it. He had a second account monk in place to drag the body away from the
crime scene, and a third account cleric ready to res him back. Turns out
this guy had at least four E-Bay'ed accounts, and juggled the goods from alt
to alt, each one claiming it had been duped by the previous alt into
accepting stolen goods. The last one gave back two of the items, but sold
the third item to a vendor and bought it back to "wash" all traces of it in
the GM logs. If he hadn't kept trying to sell them, we would never have
traced them. This guy even convinced a guildmate to "talk" over AIM about
giving stuff back, then hacked into my guildmate's hard drive while they
talked.

    We recently saw all four accounts up on Playerauctions. Presumably he
knew he could never get away with this again, and/or the accounts are being
reviewed pending banning. Here's the kicker: one of the accounts was that of
an ex-guildmate (that's how he was allowed to raid with us in the first
place - that policy changed, too). The ex-guildmate told us that he needed
his mother's credit card to pay for the account, as he was only 16.

> But for fifty bucks, this asshole just made a hell of a haul.

    He wishes. I've seen the shaman hammer on Bubar in EC. The gloves are
the items he got that are worthwhile - if he was smart he's already sold
them ASAP. And if you were smart you'd have someone in the auction channel
and in EC/GFay spamming that a pair of these gloves were stolen and are
under review by a GM, so he couldn't move them. (Or you could just watch to
see who tries to sell such gloves, in order to assist the GM with the
trace.)
