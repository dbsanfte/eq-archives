You are a whiny little pissant, you've been that since day one.  You
think we care about your life outside of Everquest or this newsgroup. 
We don't.  

You contribute nothing to this group, and when you do you are wrong. 
Note the Paladin/SK discussion.  You refuse to accept that you are
wrong, and argue on long after those more intelligent and mature than
you have pointed out repeatedly how wrong you are.  It is only after
overwhelming evidence to the contrary is presented that you even begin
to consider that you might be wrong.

precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when

aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
