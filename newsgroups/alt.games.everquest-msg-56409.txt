I had exactly the same prob because i bought everquest about a year ago but
only started playing it a month ago and found i needed expansions to make
the most of the game but they couldent be found anyware not even in eb or
game i got mine from amazon.co.uk i suggest there since you will have to be
REAL lucky to get it on the high street but uk.eb.com sell it so maybe you
could ask them to order it for you in your local eb store but dontforget
this game is a few years old dont be suprised if its been deleted in most
stores
