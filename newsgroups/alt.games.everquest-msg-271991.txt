It's labeled group, but is soloable before it greys out.  If you don't 
need Timberclaws in particular though, then I suggested a couple other 
spots you can try to find solo Gnolls.  Last time I fought them they were 
blue to me, at level 18 I think.  They wander around west of the first 
bridge on the Antonica road.
