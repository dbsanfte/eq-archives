Will people PLEASE stop fucking whining and starting petitions over
this. It's not needed, and, frankly, not wanted by most people.
Managing the 8 slots is part of the strategy in EQ. Adding more
changes that hugely. Quite honestly, I don't know any Enchanters even
who can't make it just fine with only 8 slots. You don't *NEED* every
spell in your book memorized at once.

As someone else said, a hotkey to swap out a setup automaticly would
be nice, but we don't need additional slots.
