i sometimes can -- but it takes having a hi-haste item (like cloak of
flames), hi-level chanter haste buff, and bard haste.

there is one particular group i fight with often, a 61 kitty warrior,
very well equipped, he calls for me often to join his groups for
assist melee because he knows w all that stuff goin i am really
dishing it out, and, of course, he knows i will FD if i get aggro soze
his clericses be happy.

but i know virtually nothing about warrior gear, so i will do some
more parsing as you suggest, especially when i work with warriors i
don't know very well.  it's all in fun.
