    So are our guild Dead Pools for Fire raids. =(

    There is a penalty for bringing morons along on the adventure. If you've
ever brought a moron into a room with two crates and four mobs, you know
what I'm talking about. =/

    Primal procs Avatar, and procs it a lot. I imagine they're concerned
that being able to add a damage proc to such a weapon would make it quite
powerful, as the DD proc should go off quite a bit with the extra 100 DEX
from Avatar. The BFG is just an odd duck of a weapon anyways, and has been
removed from the game. The Divine Hammer procs Divine Aura, which is meant
to be an impediment. Maybe because an added proc lowers the proc rate of the
inherent proc they're worried that someone adding a proc to the DHoC is
making it much better than intended?

    Now if only they could fix the Plane of Earth horse problems. Here's
just a sample of the stuff that goes on in that zone:

-Click off horse buff, the horse appears on top of your head. You still move
as if mounted, you cannot sit to camp. The only solution is to /q, which
leaves your mount standing where you /q'ed as an attackable NPC (which won't
attack back).
-Summon horse, every so often you end up with a targettable horse. Others
can target it but not hurt it, so it gets in the way when using F8 to target
things. When you dismount/die/zone, a killable horse NPC will be left where
you dismounted.
-When you die/port out, a killable horse NPC can be left where you
died/ported out.
-Summon horse, every so often you can target your horse but others cannot.
You can turn on auto-attack and swing away at it, but it never gets hit or
takes damage. Dismount/die, a killable horse NPC blah blah blah.
-Here's the good one. If you have a killable horse NPC up anywhere in the
zone that used to be your horse, when you try to summon your horse you will
be teleported across the zone to the horse NPC. So if your raid wiped out
somewhere bad, and after the corpses hit the graveyard you try to summon
your horse, you get ported halfway across the zone to your death. So if you
die somewhere other than near zone-in in Earth, you need to hunt down your
former mount and kill it before you can safely use a horse in the zone again
(mobs won't attack them).

    The funny thing for me is, I'm going to be mapping it back to "A" on all
my characters. I'm so used to it!

F8.

    Supposedly they're working on Line of Sight right now as a very big
project, since it impacts a lot more than just using F8 to target. I can't
wait for that to be completed - I'm tired of not being able to target a mob
because I'm not pointing right at it, or because its chest is behind a
cobweb graphic.

    For guilds with raid channels, this is a nice change. All too often
people would autojoin the raid channel when they set up their trader for the
night, and as people log off to sleep eventually the Bazaar bot becomes the
moderator for the channel. Next day, when you want to invite some recruits
to raid channel, you can't because Wubtasell the troll is your moderator.

    No. They aren't putting back the hidden spots, at least it doesn't sound
like it. Recently I've noticed that if you bought all of item X in someone's
inventory, frequently the graphic for Unrelated Item Y would disappear
instead of the graphic for item X. You could try to buy more of item X, but
you'd get a message about the vendor's contents changing, leave them and
click on them again to see updated contents. Now, if I'm reading that
message properly, if you buy out all of item X then the graphic for item X
will disappear.

    Never fear. There's still the "get many free bottles" exploit from the
Minotaur Hero's Brew recipe.

    The bags are actually pretty good. 10 slots, 25% weight reduction, and
Giant sized items. The last one is the big selling point for me - I still
have a bunch of bags (Dusty Ransacker's, Shralok, Bag of Sewn Evil Eye) that
can't handle Giant sized items. The 10 slots is nice, too. Oh, the recipe
didn't work until this change. ;-)

    For all you early birds logging on, I noticed that the game says my XML
files aren't in order, and I need to /loadskin default 1 to set it right.
One problem - I never had a custom UI, I used the default. Typing /loadskin
default 1, unsurprisingly, doesn't fix the problem. Watch for a few more
files to be pushed live later.
