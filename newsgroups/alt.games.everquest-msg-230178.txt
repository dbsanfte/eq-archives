A) your spells should have had no trouble landing.. the ones you cast on 
your party members that is, heals and perhaps remove disease (is the DOT 
disease based?  I forget).

B) your spells cast on the dragon... funny thing about dragons.  You 
need to be in melee range to land a spell.  I'd be very surprised if you 
couldn't land Any spells on Xanamech at 55 (a resist or two wouldn't be 
a surprise, but none at all over several casts?), particularly since its 
highly likely given that you succeeded that someone cast something from 
the mala, tash, and OOS lines on him, bringing his resists down into the 
bargain basement where a 46 could probably land spells... if in melee 
range, which in this case means under the dragon's tail so as to stay 
out of range of his breath (and hope someone fed him some Beano before 
starting)

Splendid
