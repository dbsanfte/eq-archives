Whereas I do like the fact that they've taken great strides in making 
sure that no one particular class becomes more desired or important to 
encounters than all others, I don't like the feeling of only having four 
basic class "identities", so to speak. I was just wondering how this 
works out once you select your final sub-class at level 20. Does there 
feel like there is much more variety in the classes at that point, or do 
the four archetypes still pretty much end up serving the same purpose? 
Serving the same purpose isn't really the best way to phrase it - maybe 
developing it's own identity would be more correct.

For example (class balance issues notwithstanding), in EQL I really 
liked the shaman class. I identified with the aspect of 
strengthening/improving my party while lessening the capabilities of our 
enemies. Sure, I could heal like druids and clerics, but, that not being 
my primary focus, I didn't do it as well. I could fill in as healer, but 
that wasn't my primary focus. That was ok, because I brought other 
abilities to the table.

Same for my shadowknight (again, class balance issues notwithstanding), 
I thought the whole idea of an evil warrior with great potential to 
"affect" a mob in such a way as to make it immediately view me as the 
threat of all threats, be it through high burst damage or tapping into 
the powers of darkness. Sure I could tank and endure all the mob's fury 
being directed at me, but not as well as a warrior. That was ok, because 
I had my own talents that were a big help to the group.

Then there were the classes that offered many different skills to a 
lesser degree (druids, bards, etc.). Whereas they weren't necessarily 
best at anything in particular, they could fill many different roles 
admirably. They really appealed to the "jack-of-all-trades" playstyle.

Obviously, for a variety of different reasons, SoE were unable to 
balance the classes effectively in that scenario, but I still prefer 
that approach to any other I've seen - many different classes, each able 
to contribute in their own identifying way. This doesn't have to be 
merely to promote class balance, but also to promote the availability of 
a wide variety of character types to which the avid player can identify 
and apply their own playstyle.

So, to make a long question a little longer, I was wondering how well 
each archetype splits within itself after level 20. The statement that 
all priests, for example, can be utilized interchangeably in groups 
sounds good on the surface, but is it due to the fact that they all 
pretty much do the same thing, just by casting different spells? I'm 
familiar with the mystics use of wards primarily as opposed to heals 
(though I don't assume they don't have heals available to them as well), 
but isn't that just proactive healing as opposed to reactive healing? 
What else seperates that mystic from a cleric as far as playstyle and 
unique abilities go? I would ask the same about the other three 
archetypes as well.

I've just reached level 12 on one of my characters, and so far the game 
seems kind of "plastic" for lack of a better word. The efforts that have 
been made in the interest of class balance and fair play just jump out 
at me at every turn, they are so prevalent. I'm just assuming that the 
game starts to come into it's own at level 20-ish, but I'd like some 
feedback from the 20+ crowd on how this is accomplished.

I'm enjoying EQ2, though it does seem to be more of an acquired taste 
than EQL or WoW or any other MMORPG I've played.
