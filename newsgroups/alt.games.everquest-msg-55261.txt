I suspect Sang already knows that. I believe the point he's making is
that Necro's are so "powerful" that it would be wrong to give them any
armor that had INT, Mana, or other stats attached. Not sure why, since
the class defining equipment of every other class can, and does, have
some "auxilliary" stats attached as you go up on levels. The necro gear
just seems to seriously suck. However, since Necros were (previously)
the most god-like class in the game, I'm sure a lot of old timers would
still rail against them having any pluses added in at this late date.

This argument also neglects the endgame entirely. I'll grant you that
Necros are possibly the best soloers out there for the 1 to 50 game
(though Druids would give them a run, I'm sure, followed by several
others that can do "ok") they become virtually useless for "uber" crap
at the end apparently. (unless you need your corpse pulled out). A
little low end help in stats would not, IMHO, throw the early/mid game
out of balance that far.
