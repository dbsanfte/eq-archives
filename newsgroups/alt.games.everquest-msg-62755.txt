On a similar note, I once /shouted that I wanted to
buy a bind in the Overthere for about 20 minutes without
result.  I finally threw in "free beer" on my /shout
just for a change, and *instantly* got a /tell from
a caster who was on the way to bind me.

When I went to pay him cash, he canceled the trade, and
asked, "where's the beer???".  So I gave him a stack
of Ale and he was happy.
