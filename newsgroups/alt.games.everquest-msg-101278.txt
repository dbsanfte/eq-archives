It's a melee binding point, so I assume you can.  I was bound there for a 
fairly long time, basically from 20ish until I finally had the guts to 
bind in Ogguk and sneak out nekkid.  It's about the safest possible 
binding point.  As long as you bind outside of the PvP area, there isn't a 
mob in the zone that can harm you.

Also, if you can't do it right now, you're still fairly close from being 
able to go to Rathe Mtns and hunt giant skels.  I know I was soloing them 
in my low 20s as an untwinked bard, but this was pre-Kunark, so there are 
probably better mobs to hunt elsewhere.
