I would concur with this.  It's hardly unreasonable for CS staff to
do something every X amount of hours to ensure that those that don't
have a trader spot currently can obtain one over those who have had
their trader up the last 72 hours solid.

However something they changed subtly when LoY went live seems to
have broken the Bazaar (on Bristlebane at least) with the zone
crashing almost by the hour even when not that busy but Bazaar
standards.  Crashing to desktop while zoning or camping, filters
being reset every time you log, the mip mapping flag being screwed
etc all seem to have stemmed from wholesale untested code changes.
