When I first started playing a friend of mine cast this spell on me and
it really confused me.  I had to cancel it because I went over a hill
and didn't come back down again when the land dropped away.  It got so
that I couldn't hit any mobs.  I didn't realise that you can look down
and go forwards to get back to the floor again.  Also, my monk was a
young looking guy before the spell and an old looking guy afterwards.
At the time I was convinced the spell had done that.  :-)  I guess that
I must have done it by hitting the random button whilst looking at the
facial graphics bit.

I wonder if this is still true.  The tutorial is very dependant upon
the charm as a reward to the quests you do there.  Unless you don't get
the tutorial if you don't have LoY.

I am male and play female characters.  I choose my character race and
sex mainly based on their looks.  I like the look of some of the female
characters better than the males so I have a female wood-elf, a female
dark-elf, a male half-elf and a male ogre.
