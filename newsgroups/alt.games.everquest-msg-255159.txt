I don't. :(  Only one computer game store in my county, and they act like
they've never heard of EQ2.  Not to mention it is EBGames, which is the
store that doesn't have it ahead of schedule.  Grr.

SAy, that's what I have for a graphics card. I have been assuming it
wouldn't run it at all, since it doesn't support directX 9.0 (unless I
completely have my cards mixed up).  Maybe I don't need to buy a new card
to use the CC disk after all. :P
