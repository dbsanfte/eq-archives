I have been in SK and nec groups, I was a rogue. They all FDed and I
snuck before I getting aggro and the mobs run off, except for the
dotted one. It worked a few times. I shot an arrow on one pull, they
all FDed and I had aggro, chomp chomp, gulp! Burp!

After that I waited until we were sure we were going to smack the mob
before unsneaking...
