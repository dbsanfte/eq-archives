/Agree.  I've heard more than a lifetime's worth of whining just about 
Halfling rangers.

Hmm.  Those would be good choices.

I'd like to see Froglok enchanters (Without resorting to Illusion: Guktan. 
:) )  And maybe bards.  And gnomish monks!  Har.  Although they could have 
melee attacks like 'Fist of the Tinkerer' and 'Oily-Handed Slap'.

I do think this is mostly a dead route, though.  If it were not 
impossible, I think the game would be far better served by eliminating 
some combos.  The hue and cry from people who actually play wood 
elf/gnome/halfling warriors/paladins/SKs/rangers (ok, but keep woodie 
rangers) would be truly earth-shattering, though.
