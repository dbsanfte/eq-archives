Very true. The bottom line is the guides didn't know anything. I had to
get a hold of the person with the real power, the lead GM. Once he had
all the information and we exchanged a couple emails it got straightened out.
You are not out of luck unless the lead GM says you're out of luck.

Probably. I still can't figure out how a crash on my end could screw up
data that is stored on THEIR end. Very wierd. I just hope it was a strange
one time occurence, and I won't be unlucky enough to have it happen again.
This is the first bad experience with data loss I have had on over 2 years of play.

I agree, but I liken it to when your homework gets eaten by the dog, you
say to your teacher "No really, he really did eat it! Seriously!" The teacher
has heard that excuse a million times, the trouble is when it does happen for
real the guides and GMs are so used to people trying to scam them that they
tend to blow off any occurrence.
