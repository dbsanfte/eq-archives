    Here's my level 47 twink warrior:

    http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=448305

    Nothing too major, the most expensive items would be the shoulders
(someone made a typing mistake and I got them for 2 K), the Bloodmetal
Earring (bought a cheap Highly Polished Gemstone and had a JCM III friend
make it), and the leggings. With Virtue (1405 HPs) alone she's over 4 K.
With the exception of the three items I listed, I'd expect any main to be
able to match her gear. And that main could easily get, for cheap, a Pearly
Sarnak Bauble (-2 HPs), Barbed Dragonscale Pauldrons (-79 HPs), and some
Enchanted Dwarven Plate Greaves (-26 HPs) and be at 3962 HPs with Virtue
alone.

    AC is tough to get at that level if you have that many HPs. The really
good HP gear is usually +STA stuff, and the best AC stuff available is
usually the blue diamond cultural which lacks STA. I envy Rallos Zek
warriors.
