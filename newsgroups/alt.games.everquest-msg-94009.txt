I have not gone anon regularly for 20 or so levels now, but then, Shamans
are not deluged by quite as many requests as porting and rezing classes are.
At least that is my experience.  If I do start to get bothered by people,
then I will go /role or /anon, but that rarely happens enough to be an issue
for me.

As to those people who think that not being anon means you are open for
business, well, piss off.  The only time I am "open for business" is when I
try to hawk my wares.  If I were a druid or wizard, this would apply to
porting people around.  The only time I would be "open for business" is when
I hawk my wares, or answer someone elses' request that was made in ooc,
shout, or auction.
