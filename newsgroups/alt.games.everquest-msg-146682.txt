I've never heard of anyone referring to this as an exploit before.  There
are several  classes with lines of spells that hit the target and all targets
nearby (up to four).  If you aren't "meant" to get targets close together
and hit them all at once, then what the heck are those spells FOR?

If you want abusive, try not quad kiting, but AE group.  Here you use
not the wimpy little "hit 4 targets" spells, but ones that hit an unlimited
number of targets near the caster.  I've killed 50 mobs with one spell,
and thats not close to the upper end of functionality of this plan.  Still,
I say not an exploit, but a tactical plan; give us tools (point blank AE,
point blank AE stuns) and let us figure out how to apply them in
interesting ways.

Both these tactics require the application of other spells and some
skill to work successfully, at least on mobs that are at all worthwhile
to kill.   In both cases the mana required is significantly higher than
that to kill a mob out of that crowd by other means... but the key
is that by killing 3 or 4, you end up getting more mobs dead per
bar of mana than you would have by killing them one at a time.
The AE group uses up the entire bar of a full group... but again
ends up with more dead mobs per full bar than would have been
possible on a "one at a time" basis or even a "quadding" basis.
