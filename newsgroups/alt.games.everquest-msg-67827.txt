My comment was actually the nature of the complaint and not the
details of the complaint itself. But I also stand that it ISN'T VI's
fault that the users having problems don't have up to date systems. I
did NOT say that it wasn't VI's fault the game now requires more up to
date systems, however. Stop reading into my words and just read what I
say.
