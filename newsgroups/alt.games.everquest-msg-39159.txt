If a group of level 20 characters in AD&D insisted, night after night,
on going back to a newbie dungeon, any DM worth his salt would either
change the dungeon or make it unavailable to the players through some
"accident."  The whole *point* of these games is that you're supposed
to face challenges, not grind out experience in the safest way
possible.

And there is at least one HUGE difference between an AD&D campaign and
EQ:  in the former, you have maybe 5 people tops interacting with an
entire world.  In EQ, you have thousands.  This is a crucial
difference.  Virtually all of the problems connected with MMORPG's are
at least indirectly related to the fact that there are so many damn
people all over the place.  People don't tend to get along too well
when you crowd them all together.  So Verant has tried to gently nudge
you on to the places designed for you by turning mobs green so you get
no experience from them.

It's an extremely mild approach to the problem.  As I've mentioned
before, in Asheron's Call there are dungeons which are restricted by
level, and when you get too high for them, you can't enter them
anymore.  At all.

It would be disastrous for VI to allow you to get experience from
green mobs.  I'm convinced that the majority of players would crowd
into areas where the mobs are 20 levels below them.  Sure, the
experience would be slow, but it would be safe, and that is apparently
what the majority want, given the numbers crammed into Omen and OT.

More to the point, is experience (AND loot) lacking for the high level
who instead goes to Perma to camp the alchemist for a Mammoth Hide
Cloak?  He certainly isn't getting experience there.  In Seb and KC
and Velketor you can get loot which sells for much, much more than the
1k or so the cloak goes for.  Again, what is so horrible that it
drives some of you into foaming fits about paying a mid-level for an
item you want, instead of spending dreary hours camping it and killing
mobs that give you no experience?

> But
>no - he wants the phat lewt, too.

Of course he does.  How can you possibly fault him for this?  If the
mob is one he can kill and the mob drops an item which is worth
something, of course he wants a shot at it.  Where is it written that
only level 40+ can get the phat lewt?

> And he doesn't want to wait for the last
>person who's there to move on.

No.  He's irritated that you, the high level, are there in a zone
designed for *him*, while you have so many other opportunities to get
loot AND experience.

I'm not sure I agree with this analysis.  If you have bunches of
people coming to a dungeon where the mobs are an appropriate level,
sooner or later they're going to start grouping up while they wait for
the AC to be free.  I've hunted Upper Guk myself, when I was the
appropriate level for it.  It's fun.

I'm not sure why you think these prices would be so "inflated."
Typically what happens if you have many people farming an item that
many want is that the price *drops* drastically.  Take the Hero
Bracer.  Many, many people know how to do that quest nowadays and you
see them auctioned constantly in GFay.  It used to go for 2k, now it
goes for as low as 800 on my server.  And it's only slightly less a
one-of-a-kind item than gator legs.

Again, why do you think this?  Prior to Kunark, you saw people in UGuk
and SolA and Runnyeye all the time.

This is part of my point.  The game shouldn't only start becoming fun
at 50+.  You shouldn't have to go through 50 levels of mindlessly dull
outdoor leveling to get to the good part.
