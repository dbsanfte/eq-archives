Nope, that's not it. I thought it might be, since I am a halfling druid, but
last night I grouped with a half-elf druid and she was tiny as well as the
others in my group, including a barbarian.

It seems to go this way: If someone is in the zone when you cast wolfform,
they will see you as the correct size. If you cast wolfform and THEN someone
gates in, zones in etc.... then you will appear tiny to them. In all cases I
looked the correct size to myself.
