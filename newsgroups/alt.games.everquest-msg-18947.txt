Don't bother buying bronze weapons, get FS or velium ( velium preferably ),
most people just toss bronze at vendors, some hang on to FS, and I see
velium auctioned off cheaply almost every day.
Although if you get bronze out of that quest, that's ok, didn't cost you to
do it.

Also, the new blacksmithed velium weapons also proc at level 1.

Theres nothing that will make me happier to make a few pieces of banded for
a real newbie than to see them auction for raw hide ( I mean make it for
free or reduced price ). I usually let rawhide rot anyways, hehe

Also, Don't forget to collect those High Quality (HQ) bear skins ( also
called pelts by players, even though actual item name is skin ), they
usually sell for a fairly nice amount ( 30-35pp on my server ) and since the
Thurgadin prayer shawl quest was discovered, every 50+ druid and their
brother has been wanting to buy silk swatches to work on their tailoring,
save up and get a sewing kit to make them ( out of 2 spider silks ), you can
also make your own tattered armor out of a ruined bear ( or cat, because
barbarians can wear either large or medium armor ) and a pattern for which
piece you want.
