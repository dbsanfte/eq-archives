Claranet
14.99/month 24/7 access no cut off BUT if you are a heavy user they will
likey ask you to move to their 24.99 a month dial up, still 24/7 no cut off
and less contention (5 -1 as opposed to 10 - 1) but they don't care how long
you are on for.

As a Broadband solution is not available to you I'd say they are an option.
Obviously if you could get cable that would be far better (and same price as
Clara's FTAT5) but as you have said BB is not available in any way, shape or
form where you are then an expensive ISP looks to be the only option.
