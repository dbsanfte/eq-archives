The priority was for EVERYBODY to be able to get rewards.  Casters
and hybrids got quest spells and the occasional random loot, pure
melees got the quested pure melee haste item and the occasional
random loot.  LoY worked very well for us.

Correct.  And, as I said, it worked out quite nicely on Stromm, there
were mid-level rewards for everybody in LoY and we went and got 'em.
I don't know if anybody bothered with the 24% version, we were already
hunting in Veksar before we finished all of our LoY questing.  I'd
guess they went after Soulscream the old-fashioned way soon after I
I bailed out.  (I couldn't put in the necessary time to keep up.)
