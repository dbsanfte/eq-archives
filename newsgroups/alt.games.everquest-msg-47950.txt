You stated:

Erm, no...it's more important to put the lower delay weapon in your off
hand.
(/quote)

That was what you first posted about dual wield, and it was 100% wrong. 

Your description on how DW works and the conclusions drawn from it,
*were* wrong because you ignored the primary hand damage bonus, a key
part of the equation. Ignoring that bonus is akin to ignoring damage or
delay - it gives you the wrong answer. Your argument says the Wurmslayer
is the best 1hander in the game, which is clearly isn't
