level 51 is about 23 times harder than level 45(or so it seemed at the
time) so I'd advise you to quit now if you think 45 is bad, seriously.
The old hell levels are like NOTHING compared to any of the 51 - 60
levels.

The really nice thing is that when you make a twink you breeze through
level 30 and 35 (and probably 45 but I'm not that far yet) without
even having an xp res and you more or less say "what hell level?"

Not sure what class you are but I got through 45 in not all that long
of a time on those barbarians at the fishing village in east karana
that NO ONE ever does because they resist nukes so well. They ensnare
VERY well though (well after a few tries) if you are a druid. I
ensnared/dot'd them BEFORE root and snare stacked so in all liklihood
they are even easier now. I had a very relaxing time doing those guys.
I think I started with kindly faction from earlier bandit killing and
by the time I was into 46 or 47 I finally got down to glower dubious.
Then I took a break and killed bandits for a bit.
