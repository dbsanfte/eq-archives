I just leveled my druid from 23 to 32 killing the Millers in Qeynos Hills.
Bad faction hit with guards of Qeynos and karana residents but if you don't
mind that then you're ok.  They both drop up to 4pp per kill and Baobob
drops a bronze scim worth 2pp or so depending on charisma.  I probably
looted around 1500pp or so in my time there.  They hit very hard and Chanda
can backstab in the 150 range so watch your back.
