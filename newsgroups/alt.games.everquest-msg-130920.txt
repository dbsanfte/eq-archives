Hi
I have several characters, and some never seem to hear the Nexus
announcments "Now porting to GD, please keep your hands and feet inside the
spire's circle at this time..."

My iksar necro especially, is in trouble, and would really like to not end
up in Toxx accidentally when she meant to go to GD.

Anyone know why I can't hear the announcments?  I can hear them fine with my
druid.  Is it a setting perhaps that I have overlooked?  Is it a bug?  I
know I am not the only one with this problem.

Thanks,
Raven
