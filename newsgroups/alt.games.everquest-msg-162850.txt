I'm in a raid.  Things are going poorly.  I pull my modem plug out of my
computer, simulating a phone line disconnect (in case the system treats
/q differently).  12 seconds later, I cast DA, 18 seconds after that I'm
out safe and sound.

Currently, I DA, quit, and after 18 seconds, if there's noone left alive
to keep the mobs off me, they come over and kill me at their leisure.
That means I need at least 30 seconds of protection, an eon in EQ terms.

With your plan in place, I need 12 seconds, and the easy 12 at that.


Didn't take long to think of one way this would make me much more
powerful than I used to be, and thats one guy thinking about one class
for less than one minute.
