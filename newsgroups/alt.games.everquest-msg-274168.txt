I still dont see how selling the time I spent playing this game is a
violation anyway.  And why you are still judging me.  Or how this makes me
dishonest.  I can see where you are coming from with the EULA, yes, but
whether or not I am honest beyond the point of that violation is not your
call.  Violating the EULA is one thing, but theft is a whole different
story.  That is in fact what you are saying I _WILL_ do, when you haven't a
clue.  You are simply a troll.  A troll who is trolling my posts because you
dont like something about me or what I do.  Okay superhero, lets see you do
that to everyone else who sells their accounts, or violates a EULA at some
point in their life, not restricted to EQ.  Lets see you make the world a
better place.  Thank you Captain Useless, you make the world a better place,
one newsgroup post at a time!
