I must have missed all the "reasonable changes" suggested in that thread.
From the quoted part, it just looks like someone complaining about a charm
nerf, then everyone announcing how they were cancelling thier fifteen
accounts.

Charm was obscenely overpowered, from PoP release to the end of GoD.  Having
a class which is designed to be a group support class, with that much
utility, also be the number one damage dealing class, by a large margin, is
pretty insane.

The new thread has a few legitimate complaints, but theres a vast amount of
BS mixed in with it.
