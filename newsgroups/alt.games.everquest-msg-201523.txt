I've never played a bard or druid but AFAIK their tracking list is always
put in order of the length of time a mob or player has been in the zone,
which is why it is sometimes referred to as a spawn meter.

Ranger tracking on the other hand can be sorted by distance and by con as
well as zone time. You can also filter out certain cons, e.g. remove all the
greens, but this is probably available to the other tracking classes too.
Tracking by distance gives you a *huge* advantage, whether you are hunting
around looking for suitable mobs to kill or keeping an eye on what adds may
be on their way. I think Ranger's also get the longest tracking range.
