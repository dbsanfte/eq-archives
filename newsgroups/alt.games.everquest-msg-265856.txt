Spawned quests. Problem solved. None of these "problems" you guys have
need instancing, nor is it the best solution.

Unless you are someone looking for a dev and have a few million bucks
to spare I'll manage to live with your judgement I am sure. But
frankly I think most people with an objective eye would agree with me.
No mmorpg could stand on its own without the first or first two "m",
as single group or single player games.

Spawned quest. No need for an instance.

Spawned quest. No need for an instance.

And none needs an instance at all.

Now look at all three of them with spawned quests and NO instances.
The brave party goes to the basement but finds out the hags down there
are too much for them - one of them even gets charmed and kills a
party member. They come bailing out with the enraged hags in hot
pursuit. The whole area around the house is thrown into chaos until
the hags thirst for blood is appeased and they go back home. The group
that went upstairs finds themselves locked in a life or death struggle
with the Knight and to their horror they discover 'death' is looking
like the likelier outcome. They put out a cry for help and a paladin
who had just come in the back door downstairs hears and charges to the
rescue (inevitably pulling a ghoul with him). With the paladin's help
the Undead Knight (and the ghoul) is defeated.

Meanwhile your instances are great the first time but almost
immediately become repetitious as people do them over and over with no
change in how it plays out, since most change in the game comes from
various forms of interaction with people. There is no real illusion
about doing some quest or anything, it becomes a grind.

EQ and its clones are ultimate "grinds" when there is no
interactivity. It was the unexpected that made it into non-grinds, and
what is more unpredictable than other players?

Right. Not every solution fits every situation. For the bosses who you
would expect to be in a fixed place, I would go with spawned
encounters or other forms.

This is a narrow view that I do not hold. Only true of EQ and its
clones.
