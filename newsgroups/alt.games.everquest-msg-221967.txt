Well, I haven't tried it yet, only just now got to thinking about
using Charm to find out what buffs various critters have in the
first place.

I'm not certain the melody will work.  A) is it targetted or
group?  If its group it won't hit your pet.  B) even if it
targettable, does it work on your pet?  There are differences in
what you can do to a pet (or PC, or group member, or yourself)
and what you can do to a mob.  C) Does it work the same way as
the Cancel Magic line?  D) if you use the melody, or a cancel for
that matter, does it work the same on a pet as it does on an
uncharmed mob?  E) Is the first thing it removes always the
charm?

If I was playing my bard more at the moment, I'd experiment, but
I've been on my mage for months now except for brief forays on
the bard to explore... he's on a different server but can still
get a look around places and use track to find mobs so I know
what I'm looking for.
