Where am I trying to save face, your the one  making generalized
comments, your the one that needs to save face and explain yourself.

Why do you think this? What makes you think that "white" Martial
artist are not the majority, sorry to tell you this but you are making
another stereotypical comment, not all asians are martial artist.
There are more "white" martial artist then asian in the world right
now, European, American, Canadian, Aussie's.
And by the way Jui-Jitsu which originated from Judo has more Brazilian
followers in the world that anyone else. So get your facts straight
before you say " They "certainly" are not the majority". But, if you
insist on wasting time grasping at straws in a weak attempt to save
face (which is backfiring horribly, by the way)...

What are these "asian inspirations" in the Human Monk Guilds other
that the fight skills.
I think I know what your going to say.....
