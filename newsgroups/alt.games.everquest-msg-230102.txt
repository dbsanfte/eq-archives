And, if I could read, you have to go buy tomes for your paladin's discs
now.  Vendor in the tunnel in EC.  Take those tomes to a paladin trainer
and give them to him - you'll have your discs back.

Discs (and the new abilities) now use endurance (replaced stamina).

They are coded as spells and break feign and sneak hide and  cannot
be triggered while sitting.

Discs of different levels are on different timers now:

For my BL resistant and fearless are on one timer, protective spirit
on another and beastial frenzy (fury - can never remember) is on a 3rd.
