It drops off the 2 hour and 40 minute, now always dead (cause people
know), green to you giant shroom thing in echo caverns (on the way to
the fungus grove zone line) The green giant shroom summons, though
that breaks normal summoning rules (its a pretty low con) This makes
the fight hard.  If possibly I'd kill all the brown alien guys nearby
first, as they assist. If a druid or something thorn self up, lay on
some dots and nuke like mad while the thing summons you and beats on
you.

Its off in an alcove there, on a mound. near where you continue to
zone into FG. You probably won't see it up much.
