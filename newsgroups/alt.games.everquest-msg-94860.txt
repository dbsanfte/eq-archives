A better solution is that the player ceases to get experience after 10 
minutes of AFK. This would stop the whole debacle, and as an added bonus 
there will be no more AFK groupmates leeching exp.

I dislike the thought of not being able to go AFK... With a monk and a 
druid, sometimes I feign or hide-while-medding and go clean house, grab a 
smoke, whatever... I hate having to reconnect, as the process is somewhat 
slow.

I think it falls underneath the Iron Glove of the PNPs.

It is certainly part of The Vision(tm).
