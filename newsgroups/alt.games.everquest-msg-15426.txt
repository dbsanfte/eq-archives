As a whole, perhaps, but we're talking about the bits where rules of thumb 
don't apply.

I read what you wrote.  I'm disproving the contrary.  It is, to me, 
clever.

Sure it is, it's just a word that is not a part of any particular 
language.

}>Just like acronyms are, 
}>despite the fact you can't pronounce them.
}I'm sure you meant abbreviation here. And, no, abbreviations aren't
}words.

Yes they are.  Neener!  And there are many acronyms that provide 
pronunciation difficulty as well.  In either case, they are both, to my 
mind, kinds of words.  Just like 'neener' is, even though I doubt it's in 
the dictionary.  

I have presented a definition to support the view that any ASCII string 
delimited by spaces or punctuation is a word.  My definition was from a 
respected authority.  You presented a definition from an opposing 
respected authority to support the notion that words are pronounced.  I 
will not deny the existence of words that are pronounced, but a search of 
your authority of choice yielded a definition that did not include the 
pronunciation requirement.  Now either that means that _two_ dicitonaries 
have included erroneous definitions for some reason, or that there may in 
fact be words that are not pronounced.

At that point it becomes a question of faith.  I have faith that there are 
unrponounceable words, and you have faith that there aren't.  I'm sure I 
don't have to explain to you the futility of arguing questions of faith.
