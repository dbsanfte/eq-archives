Interesting change tact here.  At first, you were deriding us for
taking a *videogame* seriously, when we point out it's not the game,
but the community we're defending, you change your story.

You blow up the fact that he's been posting online longer than
yourself into saying this.  But we all thought you said you didn't
believe he was on the internet for this long for the first place,
right?  Or are we changing our story as we go along again?

Interesting advice from a man who apparently lets his own life revolve
around *trolling* a video game newsgroup.

Odd that you've decided to ignore his other points and attacks, and
are apparently basing your entire argument around the fact that he
likes to post online.  Really, is this the best defense you can come
up with?  That it's perfectly allright for you to be a troll and try
to disrupt a community because this guy spends more time online than
you?

Nothing wrong with you?  Aside from being a socially inept boil on the
ass of humanity?  Nothing wrong with you, aside from the fact that you
hide behind the anonimity of Usenet to annoy people?  Nothing wrong
with you, aside from the fact that you probably derive so much needed
attention from these trolls that this is the only way you can feel
your little pathetic life to be complete?  Nothing wrong with you,
aside from your little friends in the FA newsgroup all having a big
circle jerk, excited over how long you can make threads in another
group?  A group dedicated to a videogame you claim you care nothing
about?  Oh, no, there's nothing wrong with you at all, son.  Nothing
wrong with you that a healthy dose of maturity won't fix.
