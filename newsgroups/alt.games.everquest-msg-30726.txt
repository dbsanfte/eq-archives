Epic refers to the epic weapon quest which all classes have. In most
cases it truly is an "epic" quest required 100's if not 1000's of your
OWN hours input to finish it. The combined numer of hours required
from ALL the people concerned in most cases is truly scary. Certain
epics are more valued. Warrior, Enchanter and Cleric epics in
particular.

One thing though, ebayers are reviled and usually blatantly obvious, I
suggest you tell people that what you are. And fast. If you buy an
account that is.
