Not that I mind grouping, but I have pretty much soloed through much of level
31, and am about to ding 32, on my druid. Then again, I am in no rush, but after
going through hell level (30) mostly grouping, and dying only once, I have cut
the time for L31-32 to one-third of 30-31, even though I have died no less than
7 times (so basically I have done enough exp to get from 31-32 more than twice,
in 1/3 the time it took to get from 30-31 with one death while grouping, and
with fairly good groups too).
