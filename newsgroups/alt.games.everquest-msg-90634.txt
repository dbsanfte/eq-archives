And if you don't happen to be in the game when they make a system-wide
announcement, then what? You still wouldn't know that a patch was
coming up.

You're confusing Jazz with me and Bizbee. And even then, we don't
think that no one has a right to post an opinion, we just feel it's
our right to flame people for being idiots. 

You know, it *is* possible to state an opinion and not be an idiot.
The first step is to present an argument instead of whining.

>What leads you to post a pointless post in response to a pointless post.

You're making half progress at least - you recognize that your post
was pointless.

You're far too touchy for Usenet if you think that every reply to you
constitutes an attack on you and/or a defense of Verant.

There was nothing in your post that begged for contradiction - it was
just a whine.
