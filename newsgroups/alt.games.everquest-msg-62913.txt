Well, if you have PP,

Good stuff: 0-500pp
Plat Jasper Rings, +6WIS each, 250pp
Chipped Bone Bracers, +5WIS each, 3-400pp - or get a group and kill Ogres in
WK
Black Iron Medallion, +3WIS, 30pp - or better Black Alloy, +6 for 4-500pp
Knobbed War Club or Etched Velium Mace, +3WIS, 2-300pp
Formans Tunic or Ulthork Hide Tunic, +3WIS IIRC, the Ulthork is +35 mana as
well. 100pp
Braided Ivy Cords, +5WIS - 200pp. Easy to get from Thistle Underbrush in
Lfay with Wolf Form and track
There are +3WIS earrings you can get for around 30-50pp each, IIRC. +2's are
around 10pp.
Silver Ruby Veil, +4WIS - 50-100pp, Plat Veil is +7 - 600-700pp

That's 46WIS for around 1600pp, with a pretty decent weap if you still
melee.

Better Stuff: 500pp on up
Springwood Club or Dark Ember is better - 1500-2500pp though.
Gatorscale legs
Mammoth Hide Cloak
Crystal lined slippers
Nightshade Wreath, or that head piece dropped by Narrah Tanith in SK.
Forest loops
Plat Ruby Veil or Velium (+7 / +8WIS)
