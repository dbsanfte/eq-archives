I was actually getting excited about working with it, using Borland's
Kylix (I'm a Delphi coder by nature), but then I saw the baseline
price for Kylix, and that was the end of that. I can't imagine why
they priced it so high, especially when it's geared towards a
community where people are accustomed to getting software and tools
for free.

Anyhow, I digress.
