Actually, for yet the third time (damn you are *thick*), I think they do
random drops to keep you from needing to camp the Bazaar at server reset to
get one of the limited spots.

Again, I must assume you are purposefully obtuse just because you like to
argue.  But really, what is this fetish with trying to appear ignorant?

I also *know* that Sony started compressing the entire network data stream
(for the two-brain-celled, this sentence is completely and utterly
*unconnected* to any discussion specifically about the Bazaar, though it
will affect the Bazaar as well because you are still getting the network
data stream there) in order to cut down on their bandwidth costs.  That in
itself has created issues of varying magnitude, and could be the cause of
some LD/crashing (yes, even in the Bazaar, and maybe especially in the
Bazaar, but *still* *unconnected* to the thought expressed above).

I'm sure next week you'll repeat your ludicrously flawed misunderstanding of
what I said here and earlier in the thread.  I'll watch for that so I can
bring up the actual quotes to help feed that hunger to appear to be a moron
that consumes you.

"3) During our peak hours, we're seeing around 62,000 people playing at the
same time. Even more interestingly we're seeing our MINIMUM number of people
rising to around 16,000 people. That's EXTREMELY important for the financial
success of these games. Bandwidth is priced by the Peak Usage, so we're
paying for peak usage even in off-peak times. That's why International
growth is so important due to the different playing times (i.e. the UK's
peak time is different then the USA's)."

"At peak, we are using approximately 1 Gbps of bandwidth. The data rate per
user is something we can control, so we know the direct correlation of
number of simultaneous users to bandwidth. It has, of course, grown as our
user base has grown, but the surprise is more from the user-base size, not
the bandwidth."

"Our staffing has increased somewhat as we have grown, but not really by
that much. Our network is bigger and we have many more worlds than when we
started, but we've got the system down pretty well, so we can support it
with a small, highly competent team of tech professionals."

So much for staff costing more than bandwidth, eh?

"We have "bots" like vendors that you can obtain and manage. But we don't
like you, the actual player's character, sitting online endless hours.
Frankly, you're costing us money (bandwidth) without adding gameplay for
others..."

And this beauty.  PAY ATTENTION DT.

"Do we need to kick you out of the screen if you sit there idle, so that you
can.t stay in a state that costs us a lot of money?"

"Absolutely, we do want you to play less hours. You cost us bandwidth when
you're playing. We want you to be subscribing month after month, but we
don't want you online all of that time...!
Plus, if the game doesan't require that sort of time commitment every day,
then more people can play it (since few people have that kind of time). That
means more subscribers for us!

When you look at it in those crass money terms, it's not to our advantage to
have you online for 20 hours a week."

"Market penetration of broadband won't be anywhere near where you state it
will be by 2002. Even aside from that, though, that bandwidth costs US money
too... we can't actually afford to use up a cable modem's worth of bandwidth
per player either, the game would be too expensive to run.

"Asking people to "camp" some place they are guarding for hours on end is
not only antithetical to fun (and one of the top things that people keep
asking us to make sure we don't have!) but it means someone is sitting
online for hours eating bandwidth doing nothing!"

"You're right that some costs are fixed and some scale. For example,
bandwidth costs scale directly with the number of plaeyrs (the more players,
them ore bandwidth used, period) whereas rack space costs, server hardware,
etc, go up only with the acquisition of enough players to merit a new
server.

Other costs, such as the dev team size, are determined in large part by
factors other than playerbase size."

If you want a "cite" as to my idea of them dropping people from the Bazaar
"randomly" (STILL totally unrelated to bandwidth), don't hold your breath. 
I doubt they'd ever *say* they did something like this.
