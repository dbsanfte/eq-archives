Bard wins, at least in non-raid situations. Bards just have too many
useful tools when it comes to pulling. A monk can't pre-slow or debuff
a mob on incoming. A monk can't mez an add halfway to the group so he
can stagger the arrival of the mobs in a multi-pull.  Mainly, bards
have a time advantage when it comes to pulling for groups since they
can stack up the mobs so the group always has one to kill. Monks just
don't have the tools for that. 

I used to see a huge difference when doing borderline things like Hard
LDoN where the group couldn't handle more than one mob at a time. Monk
had to wait with pulling until the previous mob was dead because with
one tank you couldn't take the chance of bringing an add. With a bard
pulling, he and my shaman would have the next mob in camp, slowed and
ready for the group to kill by the time they finished off the previous
one. The difference was a LDoN run where the group would just barely
finish in time with the monk pulling and a LDoN run with the same
group (just add bard) where we'd always finish in under half the time.
