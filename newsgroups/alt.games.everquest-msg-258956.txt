Return kick on my monk.  I guess it's not totally useless, but it can't be
even as good as innate invis to undead.  =)

That's kind of bizarre.  The elemental mold droppers are about twice as
hard as Coirnav himself.  If you can kill them, why not go ahead and
kill Coirnav?

A good comparison would be the FR script.  And sadly, the GMs agree with
Lawson instead of you and me.  I have no problems walking over someone's
corpses to kill a mob, but the GMs have said that whoever starts the script
gets FR, even if they wipe repeatedly, even if they only had enough force to
kill the trigger and plan on hanging out for hours waiting for more people
to arrive, etc.

I think my guild may be the first to make it to Time without ever seeing an
Ifir drop.  =)

GMs, at least on my server, don't even agree with this.  See above.  It's
common practice of some guilds on my server to kill the FR trigger, then
pull every mini-named in the zone while waiting for enough force to handle
FR.

I have to say, with some of the weird calls GMs make I'd probably prefer
full rotations, but if the GMs had some common sense I would definitely
prefer free for all.
