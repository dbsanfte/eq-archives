Nope.  Got to a screen showing how to get to cloud10.tv and various
other bits & pieces, but that was all.  It did tell me that there were
unsafe ActiveX components that weren't going to be run.  Disabled half
the protections on my system, and it popped up an empty viewing
window.  Clicked on that, it told me the thing it wanted to run, but
said I didn't have an appropriate viewer.  So, went where it suggested
(Microsoft) and tried getting a viewer there.  It told me that I had
to disable yet more protections.  Did so, and it put me into ActiveX
Control Gallery.  Downloaded (I think) Windows Media Player but I
still can't see the movie.  Also tried downloading ShockWave but it
gets 25% through setup and quits.
