He's stated numerous times that eating is more important than upgrading his
machine. so im not gonna bother with the details of how cheap and easy it
would be to build your own computer (parts are much cheaper seperately, and
you can build it the way you want it, not the way someone else thinks you
should have it)

But, I will say this much.. when you DO have the extra money anddecide to
buy. *do not* get a celeron. the people who will inevitably reply to this
post saying they use celeron and its the shit are either ignorant to the
facts or lying. go read any benchmark on celeron vs....anything. celeron is
not a gaming processor.
