A toss up between second or third best healer, and that is "terrible" to
you?
Quiesensce is second only to supernal elixir, druids don't get anything that
comes close to being this good.
Krag/Tnargs isn't as good as druids PoP heal, but they are different kindof
spells anyway.

Assuming a crit (have healing gift and advanced gift maxed), I can pump out
a 3k+ heal in about 2 seconds - thats not terrible as far as Im concerned.

Do you recall Dagarn the Destroyer, the named wurm in nToV?  I tanked him
for a decent amount of time, with only my shaman healing me (like the first
25% of the fight, before any debuffs were on)

I had 2 shamans in my group yesterday for a short period... my alt had been
there a while, and a shaman friend was passing through.  She malos'd and
slowed the mobs, and I meleed (450dd proc weapon with a pretty sweet ratio)
whilst stacking dots.  Sure it wasn't like having an extra wizard there, but
I for one noticed the difference.. and Im really anal about high DPS groups

Theres only 1 level 65 buff... everything else is from the 50's to 64 (stam,
ToT, acumen, Bih'li, other stats, single FoS, PE) - so absolutely no reason
why you can't do any of that list

No, it is a *real* spell

Regardless of clerics, we always have spot healers.  Guess what, some don't
even use their highest level spells either.
A lot of PoP mobs (well, anything from AoW upwards) have big spike damage,
so spot heals (and DI) are vital.

My chloros crit for over 1k, and I can cast a LOT of them on a full mana
bar.  Remember you arent there to keep a 9kHP tank up, thats the rotations
job.  You are there to keep him alive long enough for that Cheal to land.

Why would you be picking any class over any, for this?  Theres no such thing
as too much healing when it comes to a raid. Not to mention Rampage,
AE-Ramp, (flurrys, kindof), dots all need extra healing power.  Keeping
clerics alive (from mod rod damage, torpor/quies works great here)

Then there are the mobs with the real nasty AE's, the big dots and mana
drains - who is a better curer than a shaman?  Thats right, nobody.
