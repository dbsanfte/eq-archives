    Yes, Engulfing Darkness is the next upgrade. I still use Cling for the
fast cast time now that I have the timing down, though.

    Re-read what I wrote. The "trick" is pulling the Jailer past Trainer

    It'll have folks, if it's truly like Lake. The run from the bind point
in Paineel to Stonebrunt will be safer than the run from FM/FV to Lake. Both
druids and wizards have ports to Tox, and fixing faction in Paineel is
pretty straightforward.
