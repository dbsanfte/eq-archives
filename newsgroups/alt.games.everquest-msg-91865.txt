Even though the druid epic is 1HS, prior to getting the epic the best +WIS
weapons for a druid 1HB items. If you look around you'll probably notice
that many druids (twinks most likely) hold no weapon, holding an orb, paw or
book instead. These type items often have more wis/int than a weapon. I
personally prefer to have the option to occasionally melee when a snared mob
is loh and trying in vain to run. So if you are really driven toward having
the highest wisdom available to you, a weapon may not be your best choice.
But if you like being able to dive in and take a whack now and then look
into something like a springwood club or dark ember. Both are nice +wis 1HB
weapons.
