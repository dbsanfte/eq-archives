The more evenly you try to slice the pie , the smaller the pie gets as a
whole . Totally even slices and everyone gets the smallest of slivers and no
one is happy with their portion.

Also realize that what you are doing is stealing (albiet through the use of
goverment which many think makes it less morally questionable) the
productivity of one person to give to another person . This theft is WHY the
pie gets smaller . No one wants there hard work stolen by gimp beggars that
dont pull their own weight . Thus they hide their wealth or merely produce
less of it .
