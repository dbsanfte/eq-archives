Thanks for the heads up. I really hate when people get greedy over spawns.
That's one of the reasons I started playing my warrior again and stepped
away from my beastlord (for the time being). Paludal was full of greedy and
immature players. One session was plagued by an Ogre KSer. Another session
was ruined by a group that was playing the opposite side of B1 from my
group. They thought it was ok to dump large groups of mobs on our group when
they bit off too more than they could chew. In addition to all that the
place was almost always overcrowded. I'd get sick of waiting for a camp to
open up so my group could get in or just waiting to find a group at all.

I haven't been playing long but in my limited experience I've found that I'd
rather hunt in place with that isn't as crowded even if I don't gain exp as
fast.
