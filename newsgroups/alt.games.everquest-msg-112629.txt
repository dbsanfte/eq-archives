I myself have something of a close problem like this.    Of all the things I
have tried it seems to be to check and see how your irq resorces are layed
out.  For some reason my machine puts my usb and my network card on the same
irq.   only thing I can do is to disable the usb ports and then I dont have
a problem anymore..    So it might be worth a shot for you to give it a try.
