I learned the value of Sense Heading (and /loc) "growing up" in the
Karanas with my first character nearly 3 and a half years ago now). It
rained so damn much that Sense Heading was the only way to get around
the zones.

It's trivial to map the skill to a hotbutton/movement key. Every
character I have ever rolled since has maxed Sense Heading before most
other skills whenever they ding. :)
