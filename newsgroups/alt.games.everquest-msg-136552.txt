Yeah, I should have written "One, admittedly horrific, attack IN the USA and
they go beserk." Let us not forget that it's not only Americans that died in
that attack, it was the World Trade Centre and it was an international
incident. I'm not trying to say the attack was nothing and that single
attack alone was enough to warrant military action. Something had to be done
but it was handled wrongly. All America has done is build more hate because
its actions will be seen as revenge. I'm all for moving into Afghanistan but
not in the way it was done.

I didn't ask you, as it happens, I was asking hcannon18. I'm aware of the
embassy attacks

LOL. Well you get so upset, but if you read the sentence where I wrote that
comment the you would see I was making a comparison. How often is the USA
mainland bombed by a foreigner? Once, that's how often. As part of my
argument, the UK has been bombed many times but if we acted like the USA we
would be in deep shit internationally.
