Well, I admit I do have trouble sometimes when I see a beautiful
woman -- usually a dark elf or high elf but some of those busty
barbarian chicks catch my eye as well -- and I don't know what to
say because I don't even know if they're even really female in real
life.  Fortunately, since I myself am a cold-blooded, baby-eating
lizard, I can usually get away with some remark about having no
interest in mammalian attributes, which seems to break the ice.

p.s. Alas, they still seem disinclined to offer said mammalian
attributes to me for oral examination.  Maybe if I didn't show
quite so many teeth when I smile?
