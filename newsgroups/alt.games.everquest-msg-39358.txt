I have never played an enchanter of any level.  My druid found that
camouflage worked great against very high level mobs, with some exceptions
of course, made the run to Thurgadin.  I would guess that enchanter
illusions are similar, but I don't know.  Perhaps someone with more
experience with an enchanter could comment.
