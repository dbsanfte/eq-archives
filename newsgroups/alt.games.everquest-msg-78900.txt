Hehe, I am not the only one flaming you here... but I'll throw in my 2
coppers worth, hopefully change your mind.

I have a level 55 druid and a 49 cleric, so I know what I am talking about.

My druid is generally poor, as she lives off the split that comes off
groups, or if she is lucky, the commie loot. I don't bicker about loot, but
if a nice gem dropped (Let's say around level 40) I would loot it and keep
it. Unless it was a gem that the cleric or any other caster uses for
reagent. And unless you're a bit dim, you don't use dot's for the weak mobs
in Dreadlands, unless your main tank is a bard or a ranger... so a jasper
will do, now jaspers are... oooh... 1 plat, MAX. That is what you get in one
kill, let alone one hour. Now, you  think I am cheap, not giving my group
the best? Oh, I do, but I also look at the circumstances, and in some cases,
unless it is a raid, Naltron is not worth the money. My cleric? Heh, she had
2k before I could even blink. A few hate raids, some other smaller raids,
and viola, perhaps a bit less exp richer, but a LOT more cash richer.

Anyway... get off your high horse, and share with everyone. Put yourself in
the druids shoes. They don't always want to port that complete stranger,
with full planar/Dwarven/PoM armor, when they are still struggeling with
their first piece of Vermiculated/Elder Spiritist Armor. Even less so the
level 1 Noob twink, who does nothing but beg for money, armor and equipment,
and wants you to escort him to Freeport, so he doesn't die...

Solitude :o)
