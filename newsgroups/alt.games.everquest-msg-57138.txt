Apparently, where it happened most commonly was in the Tunnel in East
Commons. People would stand inside of fires or in other
difficult-to-target areas, wait for people to initiate the trade by
trying to hand them coin, and hope that they dropped the coin by
mistake. It didn't happen every time, but even 1 in 10 can make it
worth a scammer's time with the kiloplat that flies around that little
market.

  over nine hundred have read my review. See it at:
