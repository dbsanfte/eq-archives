Although not as extensive as the ongoing work on EQ, you don't honestly
believe that work on boxed game ends with shipping it do you?  Personally, I
can tell you  that I have downloaded many free updates to a variety of boxed
games I have purchased.  The various incarnations of Civilization, and
Masters of Orion come to mind immediately.

That being said, I don't actually disagree with what you have to say in
general.
