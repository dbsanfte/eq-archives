Example before nerf:

Level 57 druid killing othmirs for XP and tailoring supplies (camp near SG):
Druid cast harmony on the cliffside warrior, druid cast harmony on 
waterside shaman. Druid snare the 4 warriors, and get them to snow area 
and quad.

Level 57 druid killing ohtmirs for XP and tailoing supplies (chief camp):
Druid harmony chief, and the othmir shammy nearest water, then pull the 
4 warriors at SG end of the camp.

Example after nerf:
Level 57 druid killing othmirs for XP and tailoring supplies (camp near SG):
Druid cast his single target new harmony, using 100 mana a cast. Druid 
harmony the 3 shammys, and 2 named (not sure theyll aggro, better be on 
the safe side), and at least 2 of the warriors. Druid hope none of the 
casts are resisted.
Each cast take 5.5 sec from starting to cast till you can cast on next 
mob. If we assume all casts are not resisted, AND for the ease of the 
example we say that all mobs are in cast range when you do it (will not 
be in RL, so add extra time to run around and get in cast range, and 
target the mobs), you spend 38.5 sec on harmonying the 7 mobs. This 
means you got 1 min and 21.5 sec to snare 2 othmirs (one will be 
aggroing when snaring first, so will take some time running to get it 
snared too). And thats NOT a long time when you need to get all 4 
warriors snared, and preferably not get in meelee range at all, since 
theyre hasted, and hit hard.
If you add the run around and target factor, and maybe 1-2 resists where 
you need recast, you will maybe have 45 sec to get all 4 warrior snared. 
It CAN be done, but will be close, and fairly dangerous.

Level 57 druid killing ohtmirs for XP and tailoing supplies (chief camp):
Same as before, but druid need to harmony 3 shammys, 1 chief, at least 3 
warriors (one more inside hut that most people dont notice), and then be 
able to pull all 4 warriors before first harmony wear off. That one will 
be close to impossible.

At level 58 i HEAR the othmirs shouldnt aggro on you, so you can single 
pull. Should help a little, but still the Chief is bad and can be a 
problem.
