Well... Buh bye! They're really gonna miss your $10 a month.

And we should care... why?? Ok, perhaps this person is trolling... but
still... it seems to me that he's an asshole!!

Sorry, normal NG users... this person just pissed me off, and I wasn't even
as eloquent as Bizbee, I was just tired and assholes *always* piss me off.
If they want to leave, then just fucking LEAVE. Why do they have to post
crap about why they're leaving (as if Verant CARES), as if any of us who
play EQ care as well?? I play, I love EQ, and if I have a bitch, post it on
this NG. Most of the time, I'm straightened out by others who have more exp
than me. WTF are you bitching about, Ian? I don't know and I'm sure no one
else knows either. Wanna inform us? Think anyone of us care??

Special Olympic rejects? I hardly think so, since I, for myself, have a
degree in geology, and I'm sure that others here, more "into" computers than
I am, are hardly "Special Olympics" material.

Shit. I'm tired of even trying to make sense to you. Just eat shit and die,
asshole. Go away, EQ doesn't need you, WE don't need you. Just go off
somewhere and die.
