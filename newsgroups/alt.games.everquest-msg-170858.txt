The school hands out condoms so that the kids will *already have them*.
That cuts out the need for them to go the the local convenience store and
get them.  It also means that if they end up having sex when they didn't
expect to (and therefore couldn't plan ahead), they will already have
protection.  You say you doubt any teenager doesn't know the corner store
has condoms... well, I didn't know that till I was 18, and neither did any
of my friends as far as I ever knew (unless somebody told them and they just
weren't telling).  I was fortunate in that my girlfriend from 16-19 always
seemed to have a ready supply.  But what am I saying -- surely your son
knows the 7-11 has condoms, since you wouldn't want to risk him not knowing
in the event that he decides to have sex, would you?  Really, you never
answered my question.  Do you tell your son these things or do you think
that to tell him how to protect himself is endorsing him having sex?

Yeah, sure, the school is gving kids condoms and saying, "Hey, kids, here's
a condom, go fuck that cute girl in the next row!"  Actually far as I've
seen it sex ed classes go more along the lines of, "Sex is a serious
emotional step, many of you may not be ready for it.  But if you do make the
decision to try it, you should use these, they will make it safer."

And I still fail to understand how you can justify using any means necessary
to prevent kids from having sex, even when they have a mature relationship.
Well, correction:  I know why, your conservative religious beliefs argue
against it.  But I want to hear you say it.  You've been trying to make up
"logical" reasons that schools shouldn't hand out condoms, that people
shouldn't have sex, etc., etc.  None of your reasons hold much water, and
even those that do are not good enough to be worth doing away with sex.  I
wish you'd quit lying and just admit to the group that the only reason you
have these beliefs is for religious reasons.  I would respect you more,
though I'd still consider you a narrowminded moron.  Otherwise I'm done
arguing with you.  People like you, people who care about religion more than
human beings, you disgust me.
