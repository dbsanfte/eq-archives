When I switch to my bazaar mule, I switch to overhead view, turn off sky, 
turn off pc names, turn off all spell effects, and filter out all spells 
and all bard songs.  Since I started doing that, it is rare that I go 
offline with my bazaar mule, and, often, I find him with a modrod in hand 
from some ass of a mage that is trying to knock folks offline.
