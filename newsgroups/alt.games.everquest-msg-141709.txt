Not too many changes this time, but there were a couple of important ones I
thought it was best to get out asap.

http://www.cws.org/~pasketti

Understands new warder summon message.
Understands /played times with 0 days/hours/minutes 
  (ex: 55 days, , and 17 minutes)
No longer blows up if it hits a "Soandso saved." message for another
  player.  If you feed it mixed-up logs, it's your fault.
Converts mob names of the form "a_mob_name00" to "a mob name" in the
  Mobs By Zone report.
Now tracks AA abilities on the "Skills" report.
Now tracks AA points gained, spent, and remaining on the "Misc" report.
