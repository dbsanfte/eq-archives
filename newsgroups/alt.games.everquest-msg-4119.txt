It *IS* an enormous change.  Now dwarven smithing will actually be
worth doing (instead of requiring a basketload of Jacinths at
1000+p apiece).

Back when the EQ forums were still up, people were begging to at

wildly expensive gems, but we never dreamed that they'd just say,
"aw, what the heck, no gems required at all, have fun..."

Woo hoo!
