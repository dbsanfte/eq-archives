I am doing the Leatherfoot Raiders Cap quest that requires, among 
other things, a "Grizzly Bear Skin". I've done the quest before (a 
year or more ago) and had little difficulty finding a Grizzly Bear 
Skin, but now I've had no luck after several hundred Grizzly Bear 
kills. I have a growing stack of "Thick Grizzly Bear Skins", which I 
hope to sell to tailors.

Someone told me in-game that the "Grizzly Bear Skin" has been replaced 
with the "Thick Grizzly Bear Skin". Has anybody verified that the Cap 
quest will succeed with the Thick skin?

I'm looking for a definitive answer and have had no success searching 
the web.


TIA,

bill
