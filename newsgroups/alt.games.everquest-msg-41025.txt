What difference does that make?  They attacked us and lost.  They deserved
to feel bad.  And it is besides the point.  We were discussing whether
civilians were innocent.  Civilians who hide terrorists are not innocent and
not civilian.  Civilians who vote in governments who sponsor terrorism ARE
responsible for the actions of their government.  If they voted for it they
chose it, and they are responsible for their choices.
