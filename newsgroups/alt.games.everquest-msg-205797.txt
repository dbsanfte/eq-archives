Minor correction. Clerics get GHeal at 24, SHeal at 34. I was really
annoyed about this when in the 19-23 and 29-33 level ranges because
druids and shaman had the same core healing spells but a heck of a
lot more general utility.

The extra cleric heals at 19 and 29 are heal-over-time spells (and the
19 HoT has lousy mana efficiency).

From the raids I've been on shamans seem to wind up...
- Slowing (of course)
- Patch healing (ditto)
- Dotting
- Curing (blindness, poison, disease...)

The curing part is especially important on some raids (eg. City of
Mist, where somebody needs almost to chain cast cure blindness.)

But you seem to be right about the stackability of shamans at
raids in general... the attitude I've always seen is similar to that
to clerics in exp groups, everybody wants one and *only* one shaman.
