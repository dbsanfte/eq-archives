I keep getting interrupted.  Here's an interesting note on
the usage of prioritize:

Usage Note: It can be argued that prioritize serves a useful function in 
providing a single word to mean "arrange according to priority," but it is 
often regarded as corporate or bureaucratic jargon. Resistance to 
prioritize, however, has fallen dramatically in recent decades. In 1976, 97 
percent of the Usage Panel rejected its use in the phrase "a first attempt 
to prioritize the tasks facing the new administration." By 1997, however, 
53 percent of the Panel approved the use of prioritize in the sentence 
"Overwhelmed with work, the lawyer was forced to prioritize his caseload." 
This suggests that, like finalize, prioritize is rapidly securing a place 
in our everyday vocabulary.

Also, I don't see any of 42's posts.  If he actually made an intelligent
comment, you'll have to quote it for me.
