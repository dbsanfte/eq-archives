Depends on your class but I would say Echo caverns.

If you have a DS capable class (or can get some of those groovy potions) go
smack the needlites, awesome exp all the way to 31, and the loots ok.
My bard made 27 to 30 in one day (about 8 hours) and I only left becuase I
had so many songs to buy =)

The needlite hit lightning fast, but with a max hit of 20 and an average hit
of 8 you shouldnt lose more than 150hp per bug.
Oh and watch out for the queen, she has a nasty DoT.

If you dont fancy them the boglings are pretty good to root and rot, but can
hit rather hardso watch out if you try and melee them.
And the outcasts are pretty good exp, and can drop some nice items.
