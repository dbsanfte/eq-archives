}It's the age of blaming everyone but yourself.  You don't fit in unless

}cousin's ancestor's cat's fault that you killed those hamsters.

Err... I didn't kill the hamsters.  My ex-wife woulda killed me.  Must 
have been my gramma's cat.

ButI did marry the wrong woman, and it's my fault.  I suppose I could 
blame being crazy enough to do something so foolish on heredity, but not 
the act itself.

}> }(besides, there are perfectly normal anti-EQ people out there.  They're

}>  Maybe there's a way to make all that stuff stop
}Now don't make me start pulling out the obvious replies.

You'll have to help me out here... I haven't slept in a very long time.  
Did it involve hammers?

}> And wait a sec, are you calling mac owners 'normal'?
}Yes, normal.  Bitter, but normal. :)

This must be some new usage of the word 'normal' I wasn't previously 
familiar with.

}(really enjoyed that drunken gamers ad)

Heh, that was good. :)
