I get an invite to a Warrior Room group in High
Keep.  I accept and notice that there are only
three others in the group mostly in the mid 20's.
I told them that we probably needed more because I
was the only tank and the others were a chanter, a
wiz, and a shammy.  They say that we don't need
anymore people and that they are going to pull the
raider room.  I'm not liking this already.  I send
a tell to a guy in the gaurd room telling them to
look out cause I'm grouped with some clueless
people.  Sure enough they pull the raider room (3
mobs) and while we go to work on them we get
another pop in the Warrior room.  It was nasty, I
waited until I had two red bubbles left, shouted
train and ran for the guards.  Two of my group got
killed and two people up top died.

Guys in my group started telling me "Next time
don't run so soon". I hated to be rude but I said
thanks for the group, bailed out, and apologized
to the two guys up  top who died.  I should have
left sooner.  I still feel kind of bad, I saw the
writing on the wall and still couldn't do
anything.  Next time I'm leaving before I group
with a bunch of guys who I know are going to get
half the zone killed.

This post has no purpose.... just something that
was on my mind.
