    Heh. Recent situation on my server: top guild gets some new recruits to
replace MIAs, so they need Veeshan's Peak keys. So top guild knocks over
Trakanon, Cobalt BP drops. This guild has a points system - the more raids
you go on, the more points you get. To get loot, you spend points. In the
case where multiple people want something, person with the most points gets
it. So one warrior spends points and gets the BP.

    And promptly sells it off in EC.

    He was booted for "abusing the points system", which was a fancy way of
saying "not keeping our phat lewts ours so nobody can take the mobs we
take". There wasn't a SINGLE warrior in this guild who didn't have better -
heck, I doubt there was an alt that didn't have as good or better. But he
let "guild property" get out of the guild, so out he went.
