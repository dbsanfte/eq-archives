Hi all.  I've recently hit 49 (yay :) and have quite a bit of
experience soloing.  Snare kiting, fear kiting, straight up melee,
root dot plink, etc.
I'm working on our lvl 49 quest spell, Call of Flames, and I was
wondering if anyone knew if its possible for a self-buffed ranger to
solo the Animated Hand (need a ring off its finger) in Lower Guk. 
Keep in mind that he's accompanied by a Ghul Knight (both blue at 49
to me).  I have about 1500 HP and around 878 AC fully self-buffed. 
Walking around with a WS and LSoE as my weapons.  The technique to
split the two I was thinking of using was as follows:  Root the ghul,
and snare him.  Then swim out of that area, run into the hallway
(assuming its clear of any other mobs), being chased by the hand. 
Then Root and snare the hand.  Sit, log out (to clear the aggro list).
 Re-pop, with the hand hopefully still rooted or at least nearby, then
engage it solo.  Root, Imolate + Stinging Swarm, step back a bit,
shoot with arrows and med between shots.  Continue this method till my
mana or its health are nearly depleted, then engage melee.  Would this
method work?  Or is this just not a soloable mob at this lvl for me? 
Thanx for the info.
