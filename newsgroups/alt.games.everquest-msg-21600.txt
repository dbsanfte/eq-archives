Did that last week.  Worked like a charm.  Similarly, you can give Kizzie 
Mintopp 3pp for your honey jum, and tarn vislin and raine beteria, and the 
others involved in various Sol Ro enchanter quests like Rod of Insidious 
glamour all take 5pp in place of the 50 gold they ask for.  What's the 
other one with runes?  Was it the mask?

I sense a theme...

Rumor has it Hasten Bootstrutter has also been found to accept 325 plat, 
but I might not risk that one, if I ever have the opportunity. :)
