The closest you will get is to find a trial copy on a PC or gaming
magazine. Just be careful that the code hasn't been used.

I started on the trial copy of the Special edition (2002) of PC User
Magazine (?) (in Australia) and played the first month for three. Now I
am on my first three month extenison with out any expansion packs, so
far.

The first time you log in, do it just before going to bed as it will
download a pile of updates.

If you want to decide if EQ is your this, try entering "class" everquest
into a search engine and reading a bit, where class is bard, warrior,
cleric, ranger, druid, etc, etc.

Also make sure you downloads the "maps" for use in game. You can either
print out the maps at EQAtlas (http://www.eqatlas.com.au) or use the
ingame ones (for some areas) that pop up with the backspace keys (very
helpful at first). I prefer the printed ones.


To me, being asked to pay $AUS24/month seemed expensive, but compared to
any other activities, it is very cheap {:-). It is just that
$24/monthstill has to be found.
