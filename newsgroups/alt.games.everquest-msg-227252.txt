Specified amount.

The command is /splilt PP GP SP CP

With a space in between each coin type.   If you want to split no platinum,
you need to use a 0 place holder before going on to the gold entry.


I ML a lot, since corpses lying on the ground bother me.    (We actually
lost one collect mission in the first few days because the looter was slow
on the draw.)  I also don't lose anything important from doing it, whereas a
cleric would lose med time, or a tank / puller would lose time starting on
the next mob.  I use mouselook and strafe to move a lot, and I can end up
looting them on accident quite easily.

I try to have no coins on me at the start of the adventure to make the whole
process easier... just /split everything you have at the end.  If we do a
couple in a row without a bank stop and theres no friends there to hold my
previous share, I'll write down my starting platinum and subtract it out at
the end.  More work, but it gets the job done.
