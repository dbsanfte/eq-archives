BAHAHAAHAHAA. There are lies, damn lies, and where shit goes after it
lands in a gulds 'bank'. A guilds 'bank' is a joke and a phrase for...
'lining the guild leaders pockets'. I've rarely seen guilds that
wouldn't put Tyco to shame for guild bank corruption.

Just focus on Sol Ro flags. Get those and you can pull 10-120K on a
single drop.

Only the poor and infirm farm the HG's for cash.

... You had deaths on Derakor the Vindicator? From what? Not healing
the ramp tank? Someone pull agro?

Derakor the Vindicator isn't a major mob. He isn't close to a major
mob.. he's My First Raid Level Mob. And if you lost people on him you
got work to do. He's up like every 8 hours though so he makes a nice
test case until you can get your healage and tactics down, which it
doesn't sound like you did if people died.

Um.. no you aren't. Do Vindi and fix your strats until people stop
dying. You can at least kill him which is always a plus, and its not
like the BP's or boots won't be needed. Just make sure you can go
start to finish flawless before you start looking at other things.
