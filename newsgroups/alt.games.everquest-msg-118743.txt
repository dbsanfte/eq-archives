Of course, the problem is humans are why the Bison is nearly extinct
in the first place. :-/ Jackasses leaning out of train windows and
picking them off from wandering herds as the train passed with their
rifles for shits and giggles... These are the same types now that
swerve to hit animals on the highway.

( A college did an experiment once. They would put plastic turtles out
by the side of the highway - safe from the main flow of traffic save
maybe the occasional car riding closer than normal to the edge. Some
people would swerve to miss them if the turtles were in their path,
but a remarkable number of people swerved to HIT the turtles... )
