With an Athalon 1.4GHz, 512MB and a GeForce2 MX/400 I am unimpressed
with video performance.  Yes, the game is playable, but at times it
looks like a slideshow.  Something is still wrong when I see very very
slow response as I try to move the mouse pointer across the screen
while moving things in my inventory.  Clicking on inventory items
sometimes does not register if I click too fast.  Things like that.

I still want to know what kinda hardware the developers were running
that made them think this game was ready for release.  I can't believe
that the programmers or even some business suit type watched the game
crawl along at 3fps and decided that no one would notice.
