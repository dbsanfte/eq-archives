I have been corrected on this before, I think I have this right now:

1.  No stats affect success rate, only your skill level vs the trivial level
of the item being created.

2.  The higher of Int or Wis is used in determining whether or not you get a
skill increase.  In addition, some skills have a secondary stat that will
increase your chances of getting a skill increase.  For smithing it is STR,
for others it is DEX (I don't recall which skills off hand).

Take a look at www.eqtraders.com, they have this info there somewhere I am
told.

Of course, I could be completely wrong on this info once again too.
