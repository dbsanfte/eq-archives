Valien has already answered you, but there is also a limit to the amount of
damage you can hit for below level 20.  I want to say that it is 29 per hit,
but I could be wrong.  It's been too long since I played a melee below 20.
So the people hitting for high damage were probably much higher level and in
there for either faction or helping low-level chars survive.
