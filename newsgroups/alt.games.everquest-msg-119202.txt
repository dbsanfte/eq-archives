I used to be able to Run and Shoot kite with my cleric, but as I leveled
up my DD spells took longer and longer to cast, to the point where
an unsnared mob moved from -max- range up to "pounding on me"
range well before a DD could cast.  Since mob HP goes soaring up,
I'm forced to use my biggest nukes to kill because they give me more
damage per point of mana spent... but that means the mob must be
snared or (since I don't have snare) rooted.  Fortunately my roots
can be cast as you suggest in plenty of time unless the mob is one of
the SOW speed ones.

I suspect the same thing happens for Shamen, so that run and shoot
will also become impossible for them... but since they have the
DOT line clerics are missing this isn't all that important.
