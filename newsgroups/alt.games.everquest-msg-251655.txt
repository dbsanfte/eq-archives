Given all the posts I've read so far I have to say, the instanced
stuff has been great for me.  Primarily because I have a group of 5
that can now go to just about any pre-60 zone and have zero
competition for mobs/loot/camps/whatever.

I realize these zone do not have the latest and greatest in gear but
they are very fun even still.  And not having to worry about which mob
is yours on a pull or whether or not so and so is camped makes our
evenings that much more fun-filled.

If some or even most people want to go instanced well, not my issue.
I enjoy LDON as well but the wide open zones are alot of fun too.  As
well as zones I haven't seen for years because they were so crowded
for so long.
