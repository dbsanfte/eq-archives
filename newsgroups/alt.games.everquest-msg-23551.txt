No most Company's farm out tech support to a third party company and they
will take just about anyone to sit behind a computer and Lookup FAQ and read
back the answer if you throw them a curve they are lost. I lasted 2 months
working for AT&T WorldNet in one of those centers. Drove me crazy they
wouldn't allow you to do anything except what's printed on the screen,
wither it works or not. Some people are actually fairly knowledgeable but
cant use it.
