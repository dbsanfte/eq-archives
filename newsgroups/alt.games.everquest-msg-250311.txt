Lots of holes in my suggestion. But it is just an idea to give people
a reason to run around the lands and not take the nearest PoK book.

Still, if not bards in Cabilis, then some necro, shaman or whatever in
Cabilis is the starting point for Iksar. Given your very valid point,
I'd say that for those more prone to be KOS races/classes, that the
starting point for a quest would be at a place where the character
isn't KOS to begin with (with starting faction).

Obviously, races/religons/etc. that are not universally hated would
have an easier time with this mail quest(s) idea, but if you're
playing a race/religon/class combo that is KOS to just about everyone,
you did choose that for the challenge of game play, didn't you? :)

Note that the final token (if the quest is implemented so KOS
characters are in jeopardy at the end, since it would make sense to
make it a round-trip thing) does not confer absolute immunity to ALL
npcs, just most of them and that would be intended to make the quest
doable not a cake walk. I thought the token should be NO RENT, but
with all the 1017 and 1018 problems and the occasional ISP "I don't
want to transmit your packets until you get disconnected" going LD, it
might be better to be persistent (besides it shouldn't stack and is
applicable to a particular town).

This would take some thought to balance out the risk versus reward. As
for players using parts of quest for other purposes, I don't see too
significant a problem unless the faction adjustment is too extreme
(note, for example, if you kill Sir Lucan in Freeport, the faction
token won't make you non-KOS to Freeport militia).

Just a thought(s).
