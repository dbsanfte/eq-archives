EQ bugs fall into two categories.  In one category are things involving
graphics and sound and networking, where of necessity, Sony has to deal with
a lot of Microsoft crap.  Bugs in those areas, I don't blame them for
missing in their testing.  The driver situation in Windows is a real
nightmare under the hood, and it is a wonder things work at all.  The
Windows networking code is simply not very good.

The other category is bugs in stuff that is entirely under Sony's control,
dealing with things that don't depend on graphics or sound or networking.
These kind of bugs *usually* don't require testing on a lot of
configurations.  They usually just require *careful* testing--going through
a checklist designed by the programmers to hit all the tricky cases, and the
areas where the new code interacts with old code, and stuff like that.

I'd expect plat slot problems (and the /bazaar problem some people are
having) to be in the second category, so being annoyed that testing didn't
find them is justified.
