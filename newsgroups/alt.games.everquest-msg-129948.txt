It's a cycle of violence.  It is disingenuous to call Israeli attacks
on unarmed Palestinians "retaliation", while calling the attacks
of Palestinians on unarmed Israeli's "unprovoked".

America regards the attacking of the WTC as "provocation" - why
is the attacking of Palestinian buildings and people *not*
provocative?

Whatever happened with Jordan is totally irrelevant to what's
happening with Israel now, and I don't see why anyone needs to
answer for it.

I've accepted that challenge - not that difficult.

And, I could say the same about you spitting back Israeli drivel.

Personally, I don't take the self-serving propoganda of
Sharon and the Israeli government at face value.

I don't *think* so - I'm talking about that particular case that
made all the front pages some time back - he was with his
dad at the time, and not "throwing rocks" - plus, sensible
police forces don't *shoot* little boys for throwing rocks
at them - this kind of thing doesn't happen in Northern
Ireland, for example.
