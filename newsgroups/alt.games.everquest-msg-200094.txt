You might want to check out PoP jewelry.

For Smithing, the big money is generally in cultural armor, halflings don't 
get decent smithed cultural (if they get any smithed cultural).  Tailoring 
is a good one for halflings.  Pottery, there are some nice PoP items, as 
well as the old standbys for the Earring of Solstice.
