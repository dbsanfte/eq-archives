euh its cause I didnt even had the time to pull one !!! Like I said agro
range is huge, I was coming to the island and one jumped on me, after being
hit once, I ran away and cast snare but it was too late another one was on
me, lost my sow and died in the water.

I usually never , NEVER die while kiting, but I guess I was unlucky with the
sow ...
