Uhm....why SHOULDN'T they?

Seriously. 

A group of 6 which is balanced -- healers, tanks, and damage dealers
-- should be able to take any ecnounter with an appropriate con,
provided the players have appropriate levels of skill. 

I would consider it exceptionally poor game design to find an
encounter which 'required' a paladin, or a fury, or an illusionist.

Such things make sense for solo quests for each class, which would be
very cool, but for normal, group, encounters, the idea you need a
specific subclass, not simply a well-balanced, well-played, group,
strikes me as bollocks.

(If I ever ran a D&D game where a partcular monster could only be
defeated if one of the PCs ran a Bard (and there wasn't one in the
party already), I'd be forced to eat my screen....)
