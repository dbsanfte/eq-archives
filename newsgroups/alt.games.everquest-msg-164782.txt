Of course not, necros will pretty much put any soloer in their place.  I'd
say that druids are on par with wizards, though.  Possibly more so for the
ability to SoW and snare, possibly less so due to wizard's better nukes.
OTOH, that still puts them quite high.

Of course, this is just my view point from the perspective of a paladin
soloing in DL at the spires.  Druids, wizards, necros, and monks (who are
nice and blue to me) routinely pull faster than I can.  The damn casters
tend to clear the entire hut by themselves (often without bothering to say
anything to me, even though I've been there for an hour).  The monks have
about twice the kill rate that I do.
