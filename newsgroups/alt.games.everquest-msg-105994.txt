Whatever makes you think i cant solo one well? matter of fact i can and have
quad kited rockfiends in the grey, 4 level 53 mobs at the same time.  I also
soloed the allizesaur prekunark with my druid ( took over an hour though).
Have derailed a 5 mob train of blue mobs rotting them all.

The ability to solo is not really in question. If you happen to have access
to medium quality equipment or better ever single class can solo to 60. Of
course the list for soloing effectiveness at 60th with aa points now stands
at.

1)chanter ( best soloer par none with dire charm )
2)necro (next best soloer also using dire charm and fear kiting)
3)shaman (best conventional soloer)
4)wizards ( did i mention 4 can one shot kunark dragons? )
5)magicians (epic pet required or you sink lower)
6)monks ( with good equipment, while you cant solo many at once you can solo
one every 30 seconds)
7) rangers bowkiting with endless quiver ( you do know they hit for 500s i
hope with every shot)
8) sks are about here.
9) ooo ooo druids ! well maybe bards should be above not sure.
10-11) closely followed by paladins and beastmasters.

So your vaunted best soloers are better than 6 classes and worse than 8.
Everyone likes to disagree with the list but i tell ya what I have played
ALL of them and know better.

pre aa points things are of course highly diffrent but even then druids do
not shine for soloing . The advantage a druid has is that he can solo blue
mobs nude. No equipment of any type required. A druid can solo mobs that are
high blue as long as they dont summon but even then necros,shamans, and
chanters do it better. Necros and magicians also have deep issues with group
desirability but both also solo better.
