Run3 is an ability.  It works inside or outside. It can't be dispelled.

Journeyman's Boots is a spell.  It works outside.  It can be dispelled.

Run3 > JBoots, except when you're outside and need an insta-cast
item against dispelling mobs.  And, even then, they still work if you
have Run3, so you don't lose anything by spending the points on
the ability.  I wouldn't suggest camping the AC if you have Run3
already (better insta-cast items are available) but having JBoots
isn't a reason to not go for Run3 at 60.

That said, unless you're a puller, Run3 isn't anywhere near as handy
as spending the XP on leveling.  And, even if you are a puller, it's
still a pretty close call on whether it's better to level or not.  From
my own perspective, the only valid reason I see for doing AAXP before
60 is to stay at 52 indefinitely while doing Vox and Naggy for epic drops
if you're not in a guild which can do the other mobs with the drops you
need.
