As a magician, I generally found that the words needed to research a pet
spell at a certain level did not drop off a mob I could solo at that level,
i.e. the mobs I could solo at 34 were dropping words I could use for my 24
pet research.  My advice is to go to the bazaar and see if you can find the
components.  Don't only check the PC vendors, but also give the NPC vendors
in the Bazaar and PoK a try.  Have you checked the spell description at
eq.castersrealm.com to see if anyone has posted any advice on how to best
get the spell?  What about http://necro.eqclasses.com?
