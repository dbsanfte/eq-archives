  Are you sure Group Wolf Form is faster than SoW?  I was told by a few
people that it's actually slower.  I know that self wolf form is faster than
SoW.

  And Magic.

  Yeah, to an extent.  And of course I'm going to want a druid in the group
as opposed to having NO healer.  Druids can do a lot of stuff well, and a
druid who does their job right is an asset to the group (this is true of any
class, really), but I usually don't find myself thinking, "DAMN, if we only
had a druid!" the way I sometimes find myself longing for an enchanter or
cleric, or even bard or shaman.
