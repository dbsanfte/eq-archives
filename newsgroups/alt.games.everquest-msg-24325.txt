The important thing to remember is that it will cancel effects from the top
down.

If the charm or root is at the bottom of a stack of 6 buffs you'll be better
off waiting for it to wear off.

I've read that one strategy to get around this is to cast a less desirable
buff first (so it goes in the top slot) and then have the player click it
off after other buffs are in place.
