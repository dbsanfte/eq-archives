I recently downloaded the free version of Anarchy Online using
BitTorrent (it took over 48 hours even on my 3 MB DSL line - ouch).

Perhaps I'm just getting old and inflexible, but that user interface
is one tough nut to crack.  I haven't tried it again since the first
night because of the learning curve.

Do you know of any good AO tutorials out there?
