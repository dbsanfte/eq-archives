}>Yeap, it's not a criticism I'd discount.  Maybe it's a personal problem.  
}>But that bright yellow background in the magician card just makes my eyes 
}>bleed.  (Ok, yes, slight exaggeration.  But it annoys me a lot. :) ) Which 
}>is annoying, because in terms of some of what it represents, it's 
}>definitely one of my favorite cards.
}Then learn why Waite made it yellow, instead of
}say, pale blue. 

The easy way to do that would be if you just -told- me.  But I would point 
out that in the Universal Deck, the background in question is yellow, 
still.  Just a milder yellow that doesn't fry my retinas.  Have I 
mentioned that I really don't like the color yellow very much? :)

}>Symbolism is important, yes.
}In Tarot, symbolism is just about everything. 

Aesthetics must be the rest, then. :)

}> But I wouldn't discount aesthetics too much 
}>on its behalf.
}I don't discount it. I don't particularly care for
}the GD deck, I find the artwork a little stark,
}though the symbolism is particularly rich.

Hmm.  I thought I remembered that being a not especially pretty one, but 
wasn't sure, so I poked around on the web looking for it.  It looks like 
there might be 2-3 different Golden Dawn decks?

}Aesthetics, though, should come a poor second to
}content.

Eh, they can have all the content in the world, and it won't help a bit if 
you never feel like picking them up and playing with them.

}There is an alchemical deck around, which I may
}purchase, mainly because of the pretty pictures,
}but also because of the GD correspondences with
}alchemy. 

That sounds familiar.  I think t may have been high on my 'like' list.  
Been a long time though.

}>  After all, you can use the bit of cardstock with the 
}>picture with the lighter, more pleasing yellow background as a symbol for 
}>the bright, offensive one.  If one believes that Rider-Waite had some 
}>divine inspiration that Mary Hanson-Roberts intrisically lacked, you're 
}>only adding a tiny baby step between yourself and that higher meaning.
}Not so much divine inspiration, but a reason,
}whereas Mary just thought it might look nicer that
}way.
}A bit like covering an antique table with
}polyurethane varnish.

I'd see it more as taking a dusty antique table and having a go at it with 
a can of Pledge. :)  But either way, you can still see the table easily 
enough, rest your knapsack on it, eat off it... May even be safer to eat 
off. :)

}>And it's possible Lokari might find some other deck we haven't even 
}>mentioned even more aesthetically accessible.  She mentioned two of the 
}>better ones, in my eyes.
}I don't generally disparage any decks (well..
}maybe the baseball one!), but I'm fairly
}traditional and stick with Thoth and Rider-Waite.
}This is probably because there is so much
}literature and documentation about them, that
}comes from the history of occult Tarot, and even
}before that.
}With some of the post-modern decks, you get the
}little white booklet, and then you are left to
}fend for yourself with guesswork and assumptions.

Yep, that's definitey an important consideration. :) Those little white 
books are so often nearly useless. :)
