Heh. Yeah. I installed Agent way back when, tried to post this reply,
and it didn't go through. I got a little frustrated and went back to
Google. Thought I'd give Agent another shot, change the configuration
a bit, and *zip*, there goes that old post that was saved way back

Either that, or I'm just trying to catch up on the group and have a
