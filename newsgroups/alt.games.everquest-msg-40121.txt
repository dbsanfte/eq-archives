So does AO.  He had it right, its just to easy to exploit to really be
anything more than a pacifier.  It keeps the little tikes quiet but it's
really not a very smart idea as folks quickly figure out tricks to make
game play something other than desired.  As an example, in AO, you can
wait till you level and then get yourself killed for a free ride back to
your home point which in later levels can mean saving an hour or more
getting home from a mission.  

Coddling the weak only opens the doors for those who would be uber via
exploitation of that very coddling.  If you don't want to die and lose
your level, don't die.  That works much better than pinning diapers on
everyone.  Let those who are actually strong thrive, let those who would
exploit coddling either learn to actually be strong or wither on the
vine.
