Look, obviously I've missed your point, and it would seem that you have
missed mine. I wasn't trying to put you down in any way, nor say that
anything I do is any better than anything any other person does. If that's
the way you have taken it then sincere apologies.

As for the Shotokan thing, I'm aware of the spelling but the name was taken
when I started my primary. I also study it but am a long long way from where
you are.

Sorry for any misunderstanding, was just trying to cheer up someone who
seemed down.

Shodokan (Wishing he was Shotokan) - Rallos Zek.
