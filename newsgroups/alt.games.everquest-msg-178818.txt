    Well I guess generally speaking longbows have more range an power, but
the mechanics involved mean that crossbows have more potential.

    Another advantage of crossbows that eq misses the point on is that they
can be realistically carried around loaded. IE your first shot has 0
delay... but the longbows are acting like that already.

    Actually I think eq needs to do 2 things to archery to make it more
widely used. (yes I know rangers can kick butt with it but everyone else
CANT)

    1) more damage (how about actually using the bonus damage listed for a
start?)

    2) recoverable ammunition (50% of arrows shot appear on mob when looted)
