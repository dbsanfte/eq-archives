in between brewing bog juice (made almost 20 bottles thus far today) and
smacking the shit outta rats and snakes (gotta get scales somehow) i find
myself not leveling up as fast i think i should....

im currently level 4, half way to 5...using a pair of maces (a friend gave
me 50 plat, spent almost half on the maces, spending most of the rest on my
brewing)

with my maces, the only real "challenge" are wolves (note im staying close
to freeport since i need to use the stills for my brewing....that and i was
raped hard by the orcs last night and i dont want to loose my maces

any tips, or should i just smack the crap outta the rats, wolves, and snakes
till i hit 6 (so my corpse will stay longer than 30 minutes) ?

thanks
-Dan
