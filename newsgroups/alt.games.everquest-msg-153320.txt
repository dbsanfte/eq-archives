Oh come on what do you expect, we have  a bunch of mana free, weak DOT's.  If it doesnt resist we can kill it.  Just
takes a while sometimes.  Even if it does resist if there are charmable mobs in the area we can *probably* still kill
it, depending on how tough the other mobs are compared to the target.  Snow bunnies would not stand up well to the death
squad.  Wooly Rhinos, Ulthork ManoWars, Manticores, they can do the trick.
