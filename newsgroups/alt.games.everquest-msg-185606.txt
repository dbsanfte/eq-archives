It doesn't increase the aggro noticeably.  A couple people answered your
first question so I won't go into that part.

Answering someone else's post about more aggro being "just what enchanters
need," if you are able to nuke (my 61 nukes in almost every camp) then it's
a good lesson to learn that every wizard has had to learn by level 20...if
you over nuke, you're gonna die.  There's lots of times when enchanters
can't avoid aggro...nuking ain't one of those times (at least, it's not
supposed to be one of those times. :p )
