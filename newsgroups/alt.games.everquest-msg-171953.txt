A small rise in global temperature is causing major changes in the behavior
of wild plants and animals worldwide: Some animals are migrating north and
breeding earlier in the spring, and plants are relocating to higher
elevations and blooming out of season, conclude two major studies in today's
issue of the journal Nature.

Such changes, the scientists say, set the stage for disruption of delicately
balanced natural communities -- possibly including the eventual extinction
of some species. And they make clear the broad impact of the ``climatic
fingerprints'' caused by the one-degree increase in the average global
temperature in the past 100 years.

What worries scientists more than a shift in the behavior of an individual
animal, or even an entire species, is that shifts in many types of species
will change entire ecosystems.

``For instance, if a predator moves north, and its prey does not move north,
the prey will become more abundant,'' said biologist Terry L. Root of
Stanford University's Center for Environmental Science and Policy, a lead
author of one study.

``This may be good for the prey -- but what if that prey is a pest on corn?
That could have major implications.''

Scientists have debated whether plants and wildlife have been widely
affected by climatic change. Some scientists have argued that no widespread
response has occurred and that a few examples of animals changing the timing
of their migration or reproduction have been used by environmental groups to
overstate the dangers of global warming.

The new studies attempt to override such criticism by analyzing thousands of
reports of biological change in animals and plants and correlating them with
climatic change.

Decades of change

The survey conducted by Root and her colleagues at Stanford, the American
Bird Conservancy, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and
elsewhere analyzed data from 143 long-term studies and found that, in 80
percent of species studied, creatures changed their behavior in response to
temperature increases. All studies were at least a decade long; several
looked at a century's worth of change.

A second survey, by a scientist-economist team at the University of Texas at
Austin, observed a similar trend. This analysis of 99 species found that, on
average, plants and animals have moved north or ascended to higher
elevations during the past 45 years. An even larger study by the same team
observed that animals are breeding and plants are blooming slightly earlier
in the spring.

Several types of behavior changes were seen in response to warming. The
density of species changed, moving toward the poles or to higher elevations.
There were changes in timing of events such as migration, flowering or egg
laying. There were also changes, over time, in body size and behavior.

Over the past century, the global average temperature has increased by about
0.6 degrees Celsius, or 1 degree Fahrenheit, according to the 1998
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change commissioned by the World
Meteorological Organization and the U.N. Environmental Program.

If global warming continues, regions of the world that are considered
biologically stable may no longer be that way in 50 to 100 years, according
to both teams of scientists.

The impact of this minor shift in temperature varies greatly from species to
species, both teams of scientists found.

Some creatures do not change their behavior at all. This is particularly
true of animals and plants whose behaviors are triggered by length of day --
something that has not changed over time.

But in other creatures, profound shifts have been observed.

A water bird called the common murre has shifted its breeding period forward
an average of 24 days per decade, according to one study. California's tree
swallows are nesting eight days earlier per decade, another study concluded.
Yet another study found that Alaska's white spruces are growing less robust
in their native environment, a problem that scientists have attributed to
heat.

The golden toad in Costa Rica is believed to have become extinct because of
global warming, said Camille Parmesan, assistant professor of integrative
biology at the University of Texas at Austin.

``The climate scientists have really shown that global warming is happening.
What we've found is that it's not only happening but it's having a big
impact,'' Parmesan said.

Monterey Bay change

In coastal California, one study found that the composition of tidal
pools -- mollusks, starfish, sea urchins and limpets -- has changed in the
past 80 years in Monterey Bay. This was determined by comparing the species
found in specific intertidal study sites. In the 1930s, a biologist marked
his study site with nails pounded into rock; those nails were discovered in
the late 1990s by biologist Rafe Sagarin of Stanford University, making it
possible to compare the contents.

The University of Texas survey found that the range of territory of wildlife
has shifted northward an average of 9.65 miles per decade or to higher
altitudes by an average of 20 feet per decade. Breeding and blooming have
shifted forward an average of two days per decade earlier than normal, the
scientists found.

The Stanford survey of plants and animals found that spring-associated
events -- like breeding, blooming, migration and laying eggs -- moved
forward an average of 5.1 days per decade for all species studied.

Animals and plants have a ``zone of tolerance'' for certain temperatures,
Root said. Temperatures that are persistently too high or too low wreak
havoc with their metabolisms, she said.

These two large surveys of previous research are an important contribution
to our understanding of the impact of climate change because they don't
focus on a particular region of the world or on an individual species.

Instead, their broad scope and vast statistical analysis made it possible to
detect trends that were shared among many different studies. They recognized
patterns across vast regions of the globe and changes in behavior among
related types of plants and animals. Both studies focused on temperature
change and excluded other features of climate, such as precipitation.

The two studies differed in that the Stanford study excluded brief climatic
cycles such as the North Atlantic Oscillation and El Niï¿½o; the University of
Texas included these cycles.

To rule out the many other factors that can change the behavior of a
population -- such as loss of habitat or introduction of non-native
species -- the scientists looked for evidence that occurred over a long time
or vast distances.

The broad-scale patterns of changes in so many species strongly suggest that
temperature trends are the most likely explanation, Root and Parmesan said.

Attention needs to be focused not only on global warming, but on the
challenges it could create for animal and plant conservation in the 21st
century, the scientists say. Anticipating such changes makes it easier to
manage them.

``We've boxed all these species into these habitats that we thought we could
maintain with some mild management and a little bit of restoration and --
boom! -- climate change comes along and suddenly the very placement of these
will be wrong,'' Parmesan said.
