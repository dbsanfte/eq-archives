I have to say that, other than during way off peak hours, my experiences
with GMs and Guides have been fast, efficient, and pleasant.  I can't say
much for the one GM event I was involved in, involuntarily while I was
attempting to camp out to go to bed.  I have so far petitioned a total of
four times, once in the middle of the night, was never responded to.  The
other three times, the petitions were responded to within 10 to 15 minutes,
and I got a CS rez in each case.  One of those 3, I might add, I probably
should not have gotten in retrospect.  They were always polite, to the
point, and a pleasure to deal with.
