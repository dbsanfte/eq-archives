Same problems, are you using Windows XP?

I also have a Soundblaster Live, it worked fine with no problems then I
upgraded to Windows XP then I got the popping and cracking.

Most of the time it isnt too bad, when I'm playing MP3s or watching movies,
or even playing other games, but when I go into EQ its horrible.

I've asked around and tried all the drivers I could find but no go. It seems
that for whatever reason the people at Creative have dropped the ball and
they dont seem to have been working at it. I've had this problem for over a
month.

The only real solution is to buy a new soundcard, and you bet that if thats
what I have to do it isnt going to be a Creative Labs Audigy.

Currently I'm looking to get a Turtle Beach Santa Cruz.
