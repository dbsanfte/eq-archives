For a second computer if your motherboard will support it the AMD K6 III 500
chip under $100.00 isn't a bad choice for a cheap upgrade. I have on my
second computer an AMD K6 III 450 and it works very well. Doesn't compare to
a nice Intel P3 or the AMD Athelons but you wont have to buy a new
motherboard, ATX Case/Power supply (assuming you currently have an AT Case)
and memory. My K6 450 is equal in speed to a P2 350-400 according to several
different benchmark test.
