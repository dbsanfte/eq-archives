You forgot that shout should be used to announce trains.

/shout should be used in character.  "/shout What's the loc of the BB zone?"
is an out of character comment, even though it's dealing with the game.

/ooc (out of character) comments in /shout ruin the immersiveness of the
game for roleplayers who like to filter that channel.
