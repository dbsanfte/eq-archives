I have done it several time and the trick is to log in your the target char
and park him right were you want the stuff you want to pick up ...then log
in the sender and have him stand in the same spot and drop the times, log
back in the receiver and LOOK DOWN ASAP and pick up your items.

I like to do my transfers if none of my guildies are around or any of my
friends. I go to the gardens past the entrance and behind the pally/cleric
guild. there are never any npcs there and I never see anyone around there.
