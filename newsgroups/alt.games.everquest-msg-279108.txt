I wouldn't be surprised to see it come back.  It really depends on whether
the person(s) in charge of Winter's Roar can get some pro bono or at least
greatly reduced legal fees.  Of course, a lawyer, if they manage to get one
working for them, will tell them that shutting down in response to the cease
and desist letter is tantamount to an admission of wrongdoing and thus was
the worst possible thing to do.  If they were going to fight, they had to
start fighting from the beginning.
