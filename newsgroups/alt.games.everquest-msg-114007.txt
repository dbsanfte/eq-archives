First, they haven't said, from what I've seen, that there won't
be any corpse runs.  They've said it won't be the major hassle
it can be in EQ.   I don't believe they'll get rid of the CR "problem"
because that's the major risk that's involved in fighting.   What they
DO want to remove is the long downtime associated with CRs.

Second, "xp loss" is what causes the "xp deficit."  All they're saying
is that levels achieved will be permanent.    Instead of having the
current "if you have more than X and less than Y XP, you're level
Z" system, they'll simply have a "if you ever pass Y XP, you're level
Z" system.

No, it's most likely that the Bind system (and Gate) and travel
restrictions is so deeply imbedded in the current game that
they can't change it without making major changes that would
drastically change the nature of the game.   Spawning dead
players at zone "safe spots" instead of their bind spot in today's
EQ would cause a LOT of death loops, for instance, since some of
the "safe spots" aren't safe at all.

As far as the "xp deficit" instead of de-leveling goes, that could
probably be done to today's EQ.  But you'd end up with a lot of
level 60s with absurdly low real XP totals.   After they'd Ding 60
they'd simply shunt all XP towards AAXP since there'd be no
reason to build (and keep) a safety bubble.   That would increase
the already headlong rush towards some of the AAXP abilities.
And, frankly, the 50+ XP zones are crowded enough without
putting in a bunch of 60s who don't care if they die because
there'd be absolutely NO penalty for death...
