I have the fast drogmor, and I'd happily spend upward of 15aa to get a
faster instaclick version.

Go back to running when you need to.  /dism will instantly poof your pony
(doesn't that sound like a euphemism for something dirty?).  With instaclick,
all you lose is the acceleration time, which you lose anyway when you hit
something.

Use the horse for open spaces, and just run anywhere tricky.  It's EASY to
switch between them.

This applies to spellcasters using it for mana regen, too.  One very annoying
thing is you can't duck to cancel a spell when on a mount.  You CAN
/dism<enter>d to dismount then duck.

Again, just dismount to go down, then remount when you want.
