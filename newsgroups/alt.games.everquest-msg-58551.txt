Shamans heal WAAAAAAAAAAAY better than druids.

Shamans cannibalize to get their mana back much, much faster
Shamans have more AC to take hits if they get aggrod
Shamans have more HP to take hits if they get aggrod
Shamans SLOW STUFF, therefore the tanks require a third to three quarters
less healing.

A 60th shaman with torpor eliminates the need for a cleric in the group. No
druid can ever claim that.
