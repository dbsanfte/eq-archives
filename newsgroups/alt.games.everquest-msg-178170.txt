Scroll down. To recap, I say, "It could be a scaling issue." You say,
"No way. It can't be a scaling issue. I was the only person in Nexus
and it happened." The next day, SOE comes out and admits that it was a
scaling issue. You couldn't be any more owned if your name was
Mandingo.

So, as I understand it, you accuse SOE/VI of making up numbers not
because you can demonstrate any numbers that they've made up, but
because they haven't independently verified their numbers to your
satisfaction? You have increased your skill in backpedaling.

Oh, I also like the part where, in case anyone thought you had any
credibility, you make up a story about SOE forcing VI to change their
claim from "players" to "accounts" before Sony would *buy* Verant. Not
only are you talking out of your ass, but you're doing so out of an
extremely flawed view of VI and Sony's history. Why don't you go ahead
and expound to the group on when Sony *ahem* bought VI? I'm sure we'd
all be keen to hear.

Just to parse this out:

(1) Something incoherent about the monk nerf. If I read it right it
breaks down into (a) SOE claimed that the monk nerf was because monks
would be overpowered in PoP if they didn't nerf them and (b) There's
been no evidence in PoP that monks are overpowered.

(2) SOE's definition of "enhanced customer support" doesn't josh with
yours.

(3) SOE never implemented the web features for Stormhammer.

There are problems with all of these:

(1a) SOE never mentioned PoP in relation to the monk nerf. Monks were
plenty overpowered pre-PoP. Nor is PoP all of EQ. 60 out of 65 levels
are still focused on the rest of the world.

(1b) The best I can figure of your logic, you're saying that the monk
nerf's efficacy was disproven because post-nerf monks aren't
overpowered in PoP. I'll leave this one for you to better explain if
you like.

(2) I've got to say that I'm not 100% thrilled with the roving GM
policy, but at least on paper, it makes sense for GMs to be flexible
about which server they help depending on which is in most need of GM
attention. The new system is not enhanced in my estimation, but it
would be pretty strong to call such claims deceptive.

(3) I suspect we'll see this feature implimented eventually. Maybe
it's still in QC.
