Pretty much, eh?

I just read it over again, and thats NOT what I said.  I sat down and 
broke out why it doesn't make sense.  I built the case, best I could, 
for it -making- sense, in fact.  I just think its a weak or limited 
case, and I explained why.

Didnt' present a list of possible reasons and ask you to chose one; 
explained multiple reasons All of which supported my conclusion.  Its 
not "does it suck because people don't do camps where they don't benefit 
OR because people claim their gear isn't better than that item OR the 
normal plan is to sell ten items you loot and buy one item you wear", 
its all of the above.

You, on the other hand, snipped all that out and just said "it does too 
work," pretty much as strong an argument as "Santa Claus does Too live 
at the north pole".  Pretty much, mind you.

Soneone who Does do that research can then rip you off via NBG.  Doesn't 
even need to harbor any ill will, mind you.  It can't hurt, him asking 
to go somewhere that is in his best interest, and its not his fault that 
you didn't do the same research and so don't direct groups just as often 
to mobs that will benefit you.  Your own laziness means that he benefits 
unfairly from NBG, without any criminal intent whatsoever.

Nobody has ever said "lets do Ass/Sup" or "hey, seb Cook is open" or 
"great exp at Velks top"?    You've never ever seen anyone chose a camp 
in a dungeon environment?  I guess thats possible, if you've gone the 
paladul, OT, DSP, DL, POD, POV route, you can go from 1 to 65 without 
ever seeing the inside of a dungeon, without ever seeing a "camp".  The 
addition of LDoN even makes it probable.

"what drops there" isn't the question we are looking for, although that 
would do the job, its at least not disengenuous.

If you've never been asked if your group is doing a certain camp, then 
have you ever joined a group and not asked where it was going?  Unless 
you've always been group leader, your assertion that this question isn't 
asked leads me to believe you've gone where others wished to go without 
questioning why.

It doesn't have to be everyone.  In fact, I've said again and again that 
Most people aren't like this.  Most people, I still believe, are kind 
decent honorable folks, SOE employee's notwithstanding

The selfish, dishonest, conniving bastards that make up perhaps 10% of 
the world, though, thrive on the very decency accorded them by the majority.

And as I've said again and again, there's another segment of the 
population who benefit without deliberately abusing the system; 
innocently, by not having good gear in the first place and/or by doing 
research to determine where their next upgrades might drop, and steering 
groups in that direction.  Laziness, or industriousness, both rewarded 
just as are selfishness and dishonesty.

Its particularly funny that I put industriousness in there, I wouldn't 
have any problem with that angle, really, if it werent' for the fact, as 
I stated, that to do difficult things in EQ requires a mix of classes, 
and rarely does any given camp have a balanced loot table so that 
everyone in the group has equal opportunity to benefit.  If you avoid 
places that don't drop anything you need, then you are depriving others 
from the chance to have you in the mix of classes they need to get that 
job done.

This is my point, In Everquest. In a massively multiplayer environment 
with lots of classes and a very wide range of levels, in This mix, NBG 
provides ample opportunity for some to benefit from the generousity of 
the many.

You don't have to be paranoid to see this, although certainly you can 
argue that it helps.

Splendid
