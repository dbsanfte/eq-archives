I agree with this post...

Going into a frenzy for me gets me nervous sometimes. In a few cases I don't
mind doing it because I know I will kill the things. I have been in HK and I
will be fighting something and down below a bubble of HP and know I will
still win because they run...so I just sit there and whamp on em without
asking for a heal while everyone is screaming run because the cleric is dead
=p

Its a combo, if a warrior doesn't like to do it don't take it in your hands
to say weather or not he should. It's more his choice. In a way a cleric
controls their HP but if they don't like it don't do it. I know some
warriors aren't very good and if they get in two bubbles of hp they will run
away causing a group many problems...

I am level 32 war and don't like to go berserk because of possible adds. I
really haven't noticed any difference besides the occasional crippling blow.
