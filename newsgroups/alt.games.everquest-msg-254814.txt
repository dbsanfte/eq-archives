You should have said that horses are useless for soloing with a druid, 
not a blanket statement.  I use a drogmor, and it is great for me 
soloing, but then, my primary ways of soloing are to root and rot, or 
stay next to my target so it beats on me while my pet and DoTs kill it.  
It would likely be pretty uselss to a wizard as well for soloing, and to 
a necro, but, it is far from useless for soloing.
