Nah.  Size and strength are pretty big factors when it comes to
linemen, but technique matters too.  When I played in high school, two
of out best linemen weighed in at a whopping 160 pounds.  Difference
was that they were perfect examples of technique.  And they could get
under a persons pads pretty easily.  :-)  Part of a good block is
hitting the other guy lower than they are hitting you.

Granted, it's different on defense than it is on offense.  Speed is
much more of a factor on defense.

Depending on position.  You'd rather have a big, VERY hard to move guy
playing nose-guard (center position on the defensive line) to clog up
the middle to stop running plays, where your tackles need to be strong
AND fast to stop stuff from coming around the outside.  Offensive
linemen basically have to be human tractors, pushing stuff around.

Now linebackers, you just need some kind of psychopath to play
linebacker.  The kind of guy you just throw some raw meat into his
cage about a half an hour before game time then turn him loose.

None of this, btw, has a damned thing to do with Everquest.  :-)
