Its all about location... it was stupid of them to name it
alt.games.coh.

Do you see alt.games.eq?
Maybe alt.games.daoc?
alt.games.uo?
alt.games.ac?

Answer.. no.. because people with a full brain were smart enough to
expand the game name and if needbe put in a - for a space to make the
group more descriptive. It also clearly marks out your territory so
that some future game accidentally named Call Of Holiness in which
PC's in a rendered world pray to their makers that they get enough
people to subscribe to support the cost doesn't come around and then
you have them storming alt.games.coh claiming it for their own.

Or maybe a gay interactive game called Call Of Homosexuality in
which... nevermind.

You get my point... it was stupid, and from my understanding a hard
thing to change.. so hope they enjoy!
