Hard to tell how closely they monitor it =(
This is directly from the transfer info page, so I think if they don't catch
you now, they reserve all rights to get you later.
I can see why you would want to look at the risk given your new account
would also be in jeopardy.

If you attempt to transfer characters in violation of these guidelines and
restrictions, any laws, the EUASL or the Rules of Conduct(for instance,
attempting to transfer characters from another person's account or to or
from an account purchased by or for you or given to you where you are not
the original registered user of that account), the characters will not be
moved, your request will not be processed or approved and your account(s)
will be subject to review and appropriate disciplinary action taken.
