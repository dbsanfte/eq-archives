My gnome SK has been tinkering for a bit now and hes at the point
where he can start making aqualungs. My question is this: When I
finally get to be able to make rebreathers, does it matter if the
Aqualungs are fully charged when he goes to combine them to make the
rebreather? Would be nice to be able to use the charges on the
aqualungs then save them to make the rebreathers.
