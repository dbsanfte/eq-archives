So don't play a crafter. Why is that such a hard concept? Is someone
holding a gun to your head and saying you HAVE to play a crafter? And
where do you get off telling me what I will find fun and what the point
is for me? And someone makes your clothes. Do you really think they just
mysteriously show up at the stores? Someone out there knows how to make
clothes. Someone knows how to make guns. Someone knows how to make body
armor. Just because you didn't see a long side trip in the movies about
the people who make things doesn't mean they mysteriously don't exist.

RPGs are about diversity and people of various inclinations having fun.
Why is that such a hard concept to grasp? Why does me playing a crafter
mysteriously mean you can't be an adventurer. In fact, one of the things
I liked most about my SWG research (Which may have changed since then,
it was old) was that you would finally have a tradeskill system in place
where crafters could focus 100% on trade skills,and never, ever have to
see combat if they don't want to.

I like crafters, and I like them far more than 'adventurers'. You like
adventurers, far more than crafters. Sounds like if we both play, all
bases are covered. *gasp!* Wait! That means we have some kind of social
thing going! With multiple people playing together, and others playing
in parallel! Seems like that is what is implied by the second M in
MMORPG...
