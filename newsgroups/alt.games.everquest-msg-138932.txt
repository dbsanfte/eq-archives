Anyone with access to Copelands want to run
a comparison on these for
Offense 200
1HB 175
Cleric combat table

Both are priest only no drops, so all you real melee
out there can put your tounges back in.

Thus far my high end damage with the Cudgel is
139, I can't recall my high end with Righteousness
but its a lot lower... and it swings a lot more
often.

I'm thinking in general that Righteousness is the
better weapon due to the proc, assuming mob
isn't stun immune, and particularly if I can get
a massive DEX boost.

On the other hand, the Cudgel lets me med/attack
bounce, while Righteousness is just too bloody
fast for that.  And Cudgel is clearly much lower
aggro, I didn't taunt off the monk MA once, while
Righteousness means with a little luck on procs I
can steal aggro from almost anyone not taunting
a few times a fight... sometimes off a paladin working
his stun aggro and taunt as hard as he can.

Since both have same wis/mana/HP, the main
reason I picked up the Cudgel was the different
resists, they are precisely the two that Righteousness
is missing!
