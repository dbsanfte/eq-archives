    Isn't nearly the same, although close. With a mez, ONE hit breaks it and
send the mob towards the ENCH. There's a lot more room for errors with
root-parking.

    I wasn't pulling with darkness, unless I really wanted to split a pair
of mobs up badly. I'd always outhoof whatever I hit with Leech to the zone
by enough that I could stop, turn, and cast Heart Flutter/Heat Blood on it
as it came up the hall at me.

    Do you get XP off the Wisps? Is the quest XP sufficient to make up for
it, or do you just sell the GLSs? Can you do the quest as an Iksar with
either of the quest givers without doing faction work you otherwise would
not do, and would you be in the quest zone if not for the quest? When I
factor in rewards, I want to know about the big picture. Warrens offers me a
zone with fair XP, good cash drops, useful faction adjustments (when you
start there), and items I would actually wear / could actually sell for
cash, all in one place. That's pretty efficient in terms of time spent
achieving goals.

    I looked at your profile. Unless you've upgraded since, you're in need
of MANA/INT/HP/resist gear in a LOT of slots. I'm lucky being an Erudite - I
may get the end-game shaft by not having regen or the AC bonus, but at this
level having a full suit of Flayed Skin is huge.

    Lucky. I bet I could turn that thing into a fair amount of coin,
considering what folks will pay for the Velium Etched Stone Mace. This has a
significantly weaker ratio, but same WIS, better defensive stats, and a
groovy graphic.

    I'd buy in if he had multiple drops, or a longer respawn. As is, he's
just meant to be a tough named.

    OK, NOW you have me angry! Sol B is a great zone - look what it offers:

(A) Mobs that are about as weak for the /con as you're likely to find.
There's a reason why monks go nuts soloing the place - the mobs are
melee-soloable. That's rare. And even if you have a full group, areas like
Nox, Pool, and Efreeti offer exceptional XP in their level ranges.
(B) Wherever you go, there's Sol A: there are a ton of escape routes in Sol
B. Unless you do Efreeti or Giants, you're always a pretty short ways from a
zone. Compare that with the other dungeons in the same range, like Karnor's,
Velk's, Lower Guk. Karnor's is good, Velk's is fair (if you still have the
HP to drop down and run), Lower Guk is a death trap.
(C) Loot: the drops are still serviceable, after all this time. An INT
caster in the level range likely could use a Petrified Erudite Heart Amulet,
or a GCB. Other gear is saleable, too, like the RMB. But that's the front
area. In deep, things like the GEBs or Tranix Crown still command hefty
prices. As far as cash, given the one plat each herbs cash drops here are
better than the competition.
(D) Raid-level content. Efreeti CAN be run like a raid, as can Giants (more
Giants than Efreeti). Nagafen IS a raid.

    All this, tradeskill drops, and a vaguely-useful faction increase in
half the zone? That's not a bad place, and that's why I usually find the
zone to be camped when I go with my alts. Not always camped by full groups,
but always camped.

    I have mine on a twink, but that wasn't my point. For the NON-twink,
what would you put there? Nothing, because these stats can't have any
statistical significance? A resist gear item like the RBF which they could
camp, but which will be useless in most encounters? My warrior has gone from
mid-20's to 37 now and faced the odd Pickclaw caster (when I wasn't getting
better XP soloing Osargen), and the occasional frog wizard when doing
BR/SR - over time, the Hammer has been much better for me.
