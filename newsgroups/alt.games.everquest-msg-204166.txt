I can go into the bazaar today and with 500-1000pp twink out any  with
gear that completely trivializes combat from levels 1-20 in the old
world zones. For that same 1000pp you could equip a level 1in better
gear today than what a level 45 would have been wearing on the first
Vox/Naggy raid 4 years ago.

Further the complete flooding of the market with hand-me down items
eliminates the need to hunt in most dungeons. All of the hot items in
LGuk, SolB or SolA  can be found in the bazaar at clearance prices.
Why hunt and group in riskier areas when you can farm plat and buy
decent if not great items at giveaway prices?

Mudflation extends far beyond just screwing up the in-game economy. It
directly and adversely affects how and where people play/hunt.
