Nope.  There are basically three regions of the zone where they hang
out.  They are often in the same region.

If a Druid is doing the tracking, it is quite easy to miss them if you
don't run around the zone more.  At least up to high 40's, Druid
tracking is not good enough to be sure get them if you stay on the
right wall like that, and they happen to be in the farthest-away area
that they can be in.

I *think* that if you run around the perimeter of the lake with a
Druid, that should put you in range of them in any of their hangouts,
without exposing you to any risky wandering mobs while you wait to
find them on tracking.
