Okie... I took part in the survey... this is how it went...

The first phase WAS posted around the web... I came across it on Everlore.
It consisted of 4 questionaires, each of between 8 to 20 questions. You had
to sign in to each questionaire with an email address.

Phase 2 may or may not have been posted around the websites, but I got an
e-mail to the addy I'd used to sign in to Phase 1. Again, there were 3(?)
more questionaires, with questions based on the results from phase 1. Phase
3 and 4 were also by invitation, with questions based on or exploring data
from the previous phases.

From my point of view... the whole thing LOOKED kosher, and when the report
was published last year I gave it a read and it certainly appeared to have
been handled properly.

There's a big disclaimer right at the start of the report, pointing out
there the statistical flaws and noting that there's a difference between the
demographics of people who participated in the survey, and Verants own
published figures for it's playerbase.
