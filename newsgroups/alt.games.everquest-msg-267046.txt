    Heh, most of the new systems introduced in EQ2 were tested in some form 
in EQ1. EQ1 has benefitted tremendously in that respect from EQ2.

    They market EQ? Have yet to see an EQ ad of any flavour, although 
admittedly I don't read the gaming mags.

    I think word of mouth will still attract people to EQ1, but it's going 
to be lower and lower. I saw a prediction that EQ1 has one more expansion 
left in it. More and more, I'm starting to believe that's true.

    I don't think the devs wanted this. They wanted to "do EQ right", and 
the players in EQ1 would have screamed at the changes that are in EQ2. The 
game has too much inertia.

    I don't view EQ2 as a replacement. It will be if it has half the 
timesinks as EQ1, though - players will be forced to pick one to spend time 
on if they wish to progress. When EQ2 players start to hit that point, 
that's when we'll see the first wave of players come back to EQ1.
