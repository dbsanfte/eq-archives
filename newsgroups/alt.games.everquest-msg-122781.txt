Both my main and alt rogues bring one 10-slot backpack full of
general-purpose resist gear at all times.  My main in general
purpose resist gear has unbuffed 150ish in all resists, while my
alt has 130-140 unbuffed.  I do have guildees in both guilds who
spend time collecting specific resist kits for each individual
bossmob, but in general it seems like I may end up with 152
poison resists unbuffed against Trak with my general gear when
they end up with 170 or so...it just doesn't seem worth the effort
of carrying around that much extra gear for 20-something extra
points.

Again, it's just my opinion, but I don't generally notice myself
dying to AoE's any faster than they do...
