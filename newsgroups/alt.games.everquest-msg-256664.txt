When very few upgrades are available, and those that *are* available
cost thousands and thousands - that is what people will pay. eg
Consider the non-linear relationship between haste % and bazaar price
for droppable haste items. People pay way over the odds for a CoF (or
whatever) because that is the best that they will ever see, maybe.

A similar principle applies to raiders, except that the currency tends
to be points (sometimes it is 'sucking up'; it is rarely if ever
plat).
