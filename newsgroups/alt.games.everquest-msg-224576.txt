I can make any where from 4k to 30k in a day in Acrylia caverns.  I
tend to get up early and grab the ritualist or primalist camps (if
no one else is hunting up top I grab ritualist and just the portion
of primalist that spawns the name - but I give one up the moment a
group wants one or the other.)

I have an advantage - I can summon weightless 10slot bags - with 4
of these on me and 6 on my BL I can hold enough acrylia to make 3k
to 3.5k in the bazaar.  They sell within a couple of hours.  Additionally
I loot all the acrylia runes - vendor trash - and sell them for
about 1.5k more (after a day there).  I also take many of the 
research components and turn them into swatches (research component
+ parchment + quill in the LDoN reseach container) that vendor for
9pp.  There's a list of the ones you can do this to at eqtraders.

Finally, if I get lucky the names pop and drop the nice stuff -
grimling skin face mask (primalist) will sell in a day or 2 for 10k,
acrylia chainmail (ritualist) for 7k, acrylia BP (primalist) for
about 2k.  Best haul I ever had there was 2 masks, 1 bp, 1 chain,
and 3k in bricks and 2k in vendor trash.

I've been leveling my BL there and equipping him at the same time
(he was naked but for a solstice earring when I picked him up again 
at 46) He now has about 70k in bazaar gear on him.
