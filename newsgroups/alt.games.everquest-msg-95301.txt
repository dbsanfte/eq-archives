Just be plain bossy.  As a cleric, I'll often 'hijack' /group for a
bit if someone needs tutoring.  Aggro management, the meaning of mezz,
etc.  Or as a bard for that matter.  Hmmm, or as a beastlord?

Damn, guess I'm just bossy.

;-)

But seriously, sometimes you just need to yell "STOP" in between a
pull and 'tutor' 'em with a clue by four.
