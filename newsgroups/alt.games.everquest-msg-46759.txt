    Which is pretty much irrelevant, as the original poster said he wasn't
impressed by item stats anymore as he'd seen hundreds such items posted to
Allakhazam's. Nowhere did he say "I've seen hundreds of godly items from
NToV posted to Allakhazam's". So, for purposes of this discussion, I really
don't care HOW many nameds are there.

    You take the top item, I take the top two. Fair 'nuff.

    Speaking of "godly" items and best in class: recently, someone posted an
obvious "shopping list" character to FoH's boards and tried to pass it off
as a real one. He was supposed to have the best warrior gear in game. Almost
immediately Sean the Scaled Claw posted that his gear was junk, too few HPs,
weapons that couldn't taunt, etc. and counter-posted a spreadsheet with his
take on the best possible warrior gear. Leaving aside some situational gear
swaps for resists, has anyone tried to come up with a "best possible gear
list" for various classes, taking into account all the soft caps in the
game? It seems like a natural min-max exercise, but I have yet to see such a
listing.
