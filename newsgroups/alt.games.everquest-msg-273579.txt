Yep, it was unstacked, 4 bottles at a time. And no, I realized while 
answering the other posting in this thread that he's not a cleric, not when 
he has a pet lol. I did look him up on Alla just now, his name is Lokar 
To'Biath. Just have to figure out what I did wrong, lol. I did try quite a 
few times and quite a few ways, but ah well. I may give it a shot 
again...started playing WoW last night, so I may not play EQ for a few days 
now. :)
