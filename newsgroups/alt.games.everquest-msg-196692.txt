It depends on your group make up.  In a more traditional tank, healer,
slower group I would stick with fast dots like e bolt and  cessation of cor,
as well as vexing mordania.  I didn't get the LoY spell auspice uptil 59
either, and found it to be of limited use in PoP zones as a 300 hot heals
about 1 hit from a PoP mob.  The level 60 spell Zeefer's Theft of Vitae,
however, can be very useful for helping heal your group and any damage a
puller may have sustained on the way in.  ZToV also seems to stack with all
other hots, so it provides a nice little boost for your tank.   In groups of
the less traditional varity you have a full bag of tricks that many players
don't even know about- slowing undead, short duration mez (becareful about
this spell though, it doesnt work on higher level mobs), charm, and you can
use snare/fear/root in varying crowd control situations.  If you are
industrious and want to put together your own group, I once did a group of
Shaman/BL/BL/Mage/Mage/Necro in PoN doing banshees and wraiths and got half
of my level 59 xp there in one session.  All pet groups can be amazing in
PoP.
