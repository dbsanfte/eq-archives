Is it appropriate to let the children die because the parents can't 
afford the appropriate level of care. Even if you want to hold the 
parents responsible, it does you no good, its certainly not the childs 
fault, and punishing the child by depriving it of appropriate medical 
support isn't going to solve anything.

But that is the crux of the problem. You did suggest a solution, you 
suggested that holding the parents responsible would be better than 
letting them breed without consequence. Unfortunately that is so vague 
it just might work; but it presupposes that we actually have a system 
that could judge them "fairly" without politics, corruption, agendas, 
etc... and we don't.

The solution society has selected is the least of all evils.... for now.
