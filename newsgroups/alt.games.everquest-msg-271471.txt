Exactly. And it beats the boredom of camping whatever spot you name. And
the argument....but the ZEM in xyz - well when you need minutes to
dispose of one mob the ZEM doesn't really matter. Yesterday I got an
invite into a PoN group with my 52 necro. Fine I thought. Never been to
the planes with this char. A few mobs later I got tells from the shaman
who told me it is unbelievable how fast mobs were dropping now. And I
thought it was slow! :P

So, unless I know every mob in the ldon dungeons by their first name I'm
willing to go there anytime. :)
