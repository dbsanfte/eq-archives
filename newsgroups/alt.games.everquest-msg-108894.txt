I too have trade stuff printed out from eqtraders.  Very handy, but what I
have is a little out of date, gotta get the updated luclin stuff yet.

But.... I wanted a way to look up the spells in an instant so when I saw the
listing in the Prima book I had to have it.  It is much easier to look up
stuff in that book than going to the website because I gotta log off in
order to do that.  Seems like every time I think I have enough stuff printed
I need more information off the sites.  The prima books are very helpful,
tell me at a glance what spells each class has, ie.: I don't go up to a
cleric and ask for SoW, but I do expect him to have a much better heal spell
than I have.  The Prima book has also been invaluable in figuring out when I
gotta go back to my guild and train in abilities.  If not for that book I
would have forgotten about Dodge and Riposte until later levels.

It's not always convenient to print out stuff from a website.  Not everyone
even has a printer or the money this month to pay for the ink because
SOMEONE printed out all the maps for Antonica when all we needed was 2 or 3
maps.
