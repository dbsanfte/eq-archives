Not really, beats the hell out of months ago the fact that you'd not
be able to transfer said character AT ALL.  50 bucks is a bonus. If I
had a second computer I'd do that in a heartbeat so my cleric and sk
could play together or the cleric play with my druid.

They did, other family members can actually play from your account
besides you according to the Eula. Friends are not supposed to do
that.

They can't tell you are a family is the problem. Eight guys in an
apartment would all play different characters on different accounts if
they could for the price of one if a family could do that also. Of
course everyone taking advantage would say they were a family.
Moreover:

Kudos to you then for validating Verant's business plan in this
regard. That is exactly what they were shooting for and makes good
business sense when you think about it.
