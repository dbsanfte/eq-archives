Get three songs down pat before you worry about more.  If your system gives
you issues with three, do two, if you have trouble with two then one.  All
in all, it doesn't make one bit of difference how many songs you can sing if
you aren't singing the ones that are best for your group.  If you're in
Naggy's, and not singing Psalm of Cooling, you need to hang up your drums.

Last night in Karnor's I could have sung, haste, mana and sword dancing (I
love the buffs), but it would have been pointless, because all the mana in
the world wouldn't have mad a bit of difference to a cleric who was being
pouned on by 3 mobs.  So instead, I controlled what I could, one was a pet,
and three were mezzed.  The only times we were in trouble was when some
idiot trained us and even then we usually barreled through.

Don't worry about twisting just yet, it will come, instead learn about your
songs, and know what works best in any given situation.
