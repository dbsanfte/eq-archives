I actually read that rather than remove the class penalties, they 
implemented bonus xp on mob kills to offset them. If that is the case, 
it would mean the penalties still exist for non-kill xp. I haven't 
tested this theory to any degree, but it would explain the apparent 
inconsistencies I saw when creating an erudite paladin and other non-
hybrid classes recently. The non-hybrids dinged level 2 upon turning in 
the cell key to Arias, whereas the paladin didn't. That had me thinking 
at first that maybe hybrids still had a penalty, but the kill xp bonus 
theory would explain it.

More thorough testing would clarify the matter though.
