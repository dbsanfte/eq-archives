Actually thats exactly what I expect him to do. I seriously doubt He can
come up with a closer game to my ideal than Eq was . I want a multiple
person graphical angband where the hardest levels are intended for groups
instead of single people. I want the end game tuned for groups of about
10-15 people no more .

I also want my caster centric game back. This completely over the top melee
centric game has got to go :p
