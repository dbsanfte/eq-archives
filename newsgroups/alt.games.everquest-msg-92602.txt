Something I noticed, not having played a bard for a while and just now
firing a new one up... It seems sometime between my last stint as a
bard and now, a "casting timer" was added when you first start singing
a song. It seems to me this should make twisting a little easier on
bards, helping keep track of when the song pulses so they can switch.

When was this added? Was it announced in a patch and I missed it?
