Not true.

It *looks* like it works that way, because the client-side code
that takes a guess as to how much mana you have updates the
mana bar in the manner you describe, but your *actual* mana
(as determined by the server) is tallied by how much time
you are actually medding (i.e., if you med for 1 second out of
every 6, as you suggest, you'll only get 1/6 of the mana
you'd have gotten if you had medded the full 6 seconds).

You can verify this by doing the "med bounce" for a while
(sitting for a second or two just during the "tick"), and then
casting a very low-mana spell.  You'll see your mana bar drain
several bubbles as the server updates your mana bar with
your *actual* mana total, which is a lot lower than the
client software had presumed.
