I don't remember if there's a hotkey to turn it on and off.. didn't think
so, but it's been a while. Look under the ui section for hotkeys and see if
it's something you might have hit accidently?

you could also try /loadskin skinname 0, which should reset the position of
your boxes to the defaults (pita I know).
