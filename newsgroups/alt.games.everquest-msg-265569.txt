I had a good time with it actually, but you had to enjoy the 1 to 6 game 
because you'd end up playing it a -lot-.

What happened is when you died you'd end up respawning back in front of 
your guildleader with zero exp, no skills, starting gear, like you'd 
just created a new character.  However, if you could get to your body, 
it had your gear on it, and you were the only one who could loot it, so 
you -could- accumulate gear/loot.

Eventually, you'd have decent enough gear and have learned the new 
habits necessary to stay alive indefinately, as opposed to the EQ norm 
where you run higher risks because the penalty of death is a mere annoyance.

Sadly, the PD server was at the same time a PvP server, so once you got 
up past the safe levels it became open season, and most people (me 
included) didn't get far past that level, because most of us aren't 
really experienced at PvP in the first place, and even in the best of 
situations a higher level PKiller certainly has a large edge.
