That's not quite correct.  Elementals and Imps are alive, they're just
alien.  Summoned creatures are simply creatures from another plane.  They
were brought to one place from somewhere else.  In EQ, all summoned beings
are clearly monsters.  In other settings, summoning spells can call almost
anything from another plane, especially if you aren't specific about what
you're calling.  Heck, in the Planescape manual, it points out that all
people born in the city of Sigil are considered planar beings, and thus
valid targets for summoning spells.  If you aren't careful, you could end
up summoning a rather frightened shopkeeper instead of a minor demon or
elemental.  (Of course, that means that *player characters* in Planescape
are also valid targets.  It could be quite an adventure to recover a friend
who was summoned and enslaved by a barely competant conjurer.  :)
