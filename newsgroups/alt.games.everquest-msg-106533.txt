You have a choice...be a port-whore or a bastard.  I would choose the latter
myself.  I would personally only port around myself, group members, or guild
members unless I wanted to make some cash.  Otherwise, I would have
*several* hot-keys made up with all kinds of bizarre reasons as to why can't
port right now.
My main is a Bard, and most used alt is a Necro.  After reading people
complain about being hounded for class-defining spells (ports,gg's, breeze,
buffs, etc) I'm soooo glad my favorite toons have virtually nothing to just
"hand out".  It makes for a more peaceful game.
