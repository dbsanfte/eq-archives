I'd think more kids on welfare would not be to the state's benefit,

Or it could be a staement of love and affection between two people.  You 
never know.  Now, do the people exist for the good of the state, or does 
the state exist for the good of the people?

It's a bit like that argument we've been having (over here in a.g.e) about 
guilds and their membership.
