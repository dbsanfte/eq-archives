Wait.  So are the 50 AAs significant, or not?  Seems like if they make a real
difference, you make a rational choice as to what adds the most fun to your
game at any given moment.  

If you won't be able to see the difference except from parsing, and you WOULD
see some difference from getting something else, it seems a no-brainer.

I'm not in a raiding guild, but this would seem to be as incorrect on whoever
is threatening to kick you out if you don't get approved AAs in order as it
would be on your part if you chose this path without coercion.

Making choices whether to benefit your raid play or your single-group play
first is something you have to do, of course.  But that's far different from
saying these are so minute that you won't be able to really tell and at the
same time you'll be useless to your guild without them.
