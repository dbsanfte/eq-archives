So from what you mentioned, as well as what I already know, an Iksar is
likely a better choice.  And since at the moment my Barbarian Warrior with
almost 450pp in the bank (for himself, won't share with scaley one) I've got
something else to do if I want to LV. Plus seeing that I've only done 4 main
characters, LV17, 15, 12, and 19, in 21 months, I'm obviously not playing to
level fast. I've also considered starting a new race/class when SoL starts,
one of them cat beastlords since it will be the first new race and class at
the same time (first new class ever). I'd like to be one of the beginners,
one of the firsts. There is fun in nobody else having already done
everything or most of it.  It can be fun for everyone to start out new.
Sometimes I wish I'd have started EQ back when it first was released, or
even in beta. I'm in most of it for the adventure. I've almost needed a new
hard drive from all my screenshots.
