Generally you have at least two heals worth memming, your current biggest,
and the one before that which will usually be cheaper and faster casting.
Your third slot will be your most mana efficient heal, usually your HP
buff but sometimes a Heal Over Time or something like that.

Its been forever since I was 30, but 3 slots dedicated to buffs seems
highly excessive.  One slot, where you can swap a buff in and out as
needed, that I can see.  In that slot, keep your non-symbol HP buff
(guard?  or is that AC and Bravery HP?) which will probably double as your
most mana efficient heal.

Enstill is a long lasting root.  Trouble is, its also slow casting.  And
mobs tend to break root on their own before it wears off, making Enstill
really have little more in duration than Root.  Root is cheaper, faster,
and Tends to do the same job.  This condition is not unique to this spell,
every class should look carefully at their "upgrade" spells to see if each
is  really better than the lower level one.

> 7. Divine Aura

Here's an example, when you get Divine Barrier, thats not better for most
uses than this spell.  Oh, and I see you have Stun memmed above.  Another
sterling example, Stun is worlds better than every other stun you ever
get; faster, cheaper, less resisted, and never breaks mez.

My suggestions would free up one slot, which you could dedicate to a nuke
for use in a situation where you generally have more mana than you know
what to do with, or a DOT for use on rooted undeads, or a second stun for
caster interrupt duty, or my personal favorite, the often overlooked Flash
of Light.... or more classicly, Fear if you have a snaring partner.

I'd also consider ditching Gate, which in an emergency you can mem while
under DA.  Third Stun, second root, flash, wave of fear... the
possibilities are, well not endless but certainly numerous.
