Opinion???

It is not an opinion that sniffer programs exist.

It is not an opinion that password schemes are getting hacked on an hourly
basis.

It is not an opinion that you an intercept data and duplicate it.

And, I posted the information. I posted the book which covers all of this in
great detail, along with the link on how to buy it. What do you want me to do?
Fly to her city, stop by her home, and show her how to use a sniffer?

Also, one thing I would suggest is tell them the real world cash value of your
characters and items. 

However, the problem is said routine is like trying to prove there are no
undiscovered large undersea animals by putting a camera at the bottom of the
ocean, and when none swim by, there is your proof.

A better method is to go to alt.cracks, alt.security, and alt.2600 and read
their FAQs. Then post a message or two asking how this can be done.

You will get swamped with information and links without trying to prove guns
are a myth by standing in front of a firing squad.

Make no mistake, I did toy with the idea of asking someone to snag for me
Lokari's password, but I know these kinds of people. I had an equal chance of
them doing that as I did of them snagging mine and e-mailing it to her.
Besides, do we really want these people to begin to think about attacking EQ
passwords?

================================================

"Stupidity is the most common element in the 
Universe, and one of the most destructive.
Fortunately, it tends to form a solid bond with
laziness, which is the second most common.
Without the abundance of laziness in the universe,
we might all be dead."
