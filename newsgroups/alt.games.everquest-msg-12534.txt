I always buy them, a guild member will give them at cost for 60pp but if he
not aroudn I buy them for 100pp. For the cost of those boots from Sol i
could buy more sow potions than I will ever need, I only use the potion as
last resort as  I normally trade a sow for a clarity. Shrink and gate
potions people do buy as the Thurgadin one only takes you to Thurgadin and
you can only have one at any one time.
