I still laugh at this story and wish I could take credit for it...

<clipped from everquest boards>

I always like to read funny stories about people's experiences in the
game. Here's one of mine:
I was invisible and running through the Karanas one day when I noticed
a young gnome near the gypsy camp. He was fighting a lion and though
it looked like he would win the battle, being a fellow gnome, I
decided to help the guy out.

I targeted the lion, clicked on my mesmerize spell, then *started* to
type: "I'm mesmerizing the lion for you." I got as far as: "I'm " when
I remembered that I had replaced my mesmerize spell with an Area of
Effect mesmerize spell... and that I was standing next to an NPC
enchantress. Gulp.

My movement keys are mapped to "w a s d" so I frantically stabbed at
my keyboard, trying to MOVE and interrupt the spell.

I forgot that I was in typing mode.

The gypsy enchantress didn't like my attempt to mezz her so she
promptly charmed me and made me go after the gnome I had been trying
to *save*. I watched in horror as my peace-loving character, knife
flailing like a crazed sushi chef, chased the little guy down and
stabbed him to death.

I found my victim later and apologized profusely... I even gave him a
nice weapon and a piece of armor. He was great about it, and laughed
when I told him what happened.

He said he didn't know WHAT was going on. One minute he was fighting a
lion, the next minute a strange gnome appeared out of NOWHERE,
announced: "I'm wwwaaaddd", then sliced him up like Freddy Krueger.

[sigh]

<end of snip>

"I'm wwwaaaddd"  whack...whack...  ----  ROFLAO
