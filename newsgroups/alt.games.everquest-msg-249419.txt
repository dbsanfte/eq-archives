All true.. but you forgot to mention that the undercons are also social 
and high aggro... as if pulling a single blue undercon at level 13 isn't 
enough.

Still for worst newbie zone ever... innothule swamp is hard to beat.
Its great up to about level 5, fabulous even, but as soon as you go a 
little deeper... its brutal. High aggro social red burly kobolds 
everywhere, high aggro red troll invaders everywhere. A few high aggro 
frogloks (e.g. the 'exiled froglok') A mess of islands and water that 
slows you down when you try to escape. Sticky trees even at the best of 
times, mobs that run (did i mention the water that slows you down when 
you pursue them) and awful corpse recoveries once you hit level 10 in a 
zone that is 50% underwater (did i mention the water? :))

I think that's a bit of a special case :)
