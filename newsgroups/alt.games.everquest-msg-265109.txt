Hey thanks for sticking up for me.  Mucho appreciated.  I do think however 
that names aliases on Newsgroups are not owned or unique to us.  Where is 
the copyright?  As much as I despise my impersonator he is doing nothing 
wrong.  There are literally billions of users who frequent message boards 
and newsgroups.  For every penney they put in my pocket for duplicate 
names..I'd be as rich as Donald Trump!

Thanks guys !
