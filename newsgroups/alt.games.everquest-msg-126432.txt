Well I was going to write about your greedy ass attitude, then I noticed
your disclaimer.. plus, your a rogue.. isn't that what they do! :)

A guildie rogue has got "escape".. although only 1 use and long recycle
time, it does seem much much better than FD in certain circumstances.

As for exp.. the average 60 rogue, I can outdamage.. of course theres not
many in my guild with gear that could be called average, so it doesn't help
me much.  Im usually with the rogues/monks/rangers anyway tho :)

If im not with "the rogue" (he grabs rogues, monks, rangers.. in that order)
Im typically in a monk group (4 monks and 1 ranger perhaps).. we also have a
wizard group (5 60 wizards and a 60 druid)

The exp split is interesting though..  rogue group is at 40% or so,
monks/wizards at 25%, and 10% to misc groups

Of course, I don't make groups with the intent of ksing!
