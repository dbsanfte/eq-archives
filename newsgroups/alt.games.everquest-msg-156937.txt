	It's not that the encounters were too easy.  Using Harmony in a lot of
places was an art -- in some camps you have to stand in precise places and
cast in a precise order to split the pull.  I find it extremely unlikely that
there are encounters in PoP that are trivialized by Harmony, too.  If there
are, they are likely trivialized by anyone who brought a Monk or Enchanter
with them.

	It's a matter of aesthetics.  The guys who designed that spell wanted
Rangers (and Druids, though I've hardly ever seen one use Harmony) to be able
to split pulls.  These guys don't.  They want crowd control to be mandatory,
and splits (if any) done by Monks.
