Perhaps because while faction is indeed important, the text message
about faction changes isn't *quite* so critical. It's annoying,
certainly, and if you're fighting something unfamiliar you might not
be able to clearly tell what's happening to your faction, but so long
as the *actual* faction is being handled correctly (and who knows if
it really is), that's the important thing.
