    Is useful CHA gear easy to come by? By that I mean the following: my
enchanter's INT gear is almost never pure INT gear, but rather INT/HP or
INT/resist gear (with +MANA thrown in here and there). Her GEBs might be the
only exception. When I see CHA gear for an enchanter, I see things like
Golden Cat's Eye Bracers, or a Rod of Insidious Glamour. These items pretty
well do NOTHING but add CHA. So are there many utility CHA items (like King
Tranix's Crown with the MR)? If not, it might be wise to go mostly CHA at
creation knowing that the INT items one is after are useful for other
purposes, too, no?

    This is ignoring the "well, INT lets me play my baby enchanter NOW
without dying so much" practical arguments, of course. 8)
