There's no contradiction in what I'm saying.  I'll admit that I may not be
explaining it well enough for people to see that, and I'm TRYING, but
there's no contradiction.  Please read over some of my other posts in this
thread, maybe in one of them I will have explained it well enough for you to
see...

This first part is absolutely true, and is the center of what I'm saying,
but the second part does not follow.

I'm am very lucky and very blessed to have been one of the founding members
of the Arbiters on E'Ci.  My play is sporadic, so I am nowhere near as high
level as some of their secondaries, much less their primaries, but they have
always gone out of their way for me, and I enjoyed being able to help them
in some small way when they needed a port.

These ports are NOT the only reason I have friends.  They have put up with
me even though I take vacations from EQ that last many months.  They've put
up with the fact that I rarely have more than an hour or two to play per
session, and so end up soloing too much.  They have welcomed me into groups,
and gone out of their way to make me FEEL welcome, despite my inexperience.
I could be playing the part of a Moss Snake, and be just as useful, and
these people would welcome me, and help me.

None of this however, stops me from WANTING to be useful to them, and the
fact that I still have SOME things I can do doesn't keep me from regretting
that the major part of what I used to offer them is gone.  I WANT them to
have this easy porting, I would argue against its removal, but this is a
grouping game.  Characters work in teams, each offering the others his or
her special abilities.  The utility of my class has just been reduced, one
of its main special abilities has been rendered much less useful, and I want
something in its place so I can continue to feel like I'm useful to my
friends.

Now I've just learned (again, I've been gone for awhile) that we have
recently received a new heal.  I'm going to check that out, maybe it adds
more to our usefulness than past such attempts have, but normally when VI
has done something like this, they had the habit of shoving us into the role
of "second class clerics" instead of adding to our current identity.

Very!  ;-)

Well, I understand what you're saying...  Friendship isn't about what you
offer each other, it's about your company, input, and enjoying hanging out
together.

I just don't like the feeling that I'm too often on the receiving end of the
things we all do for each other in this game.  I like to feel like I'm
pulling my weight, that I'm needed for what I can DO as well as the jokes I
make in /gu.  What I'm saying is that if they have reduced what I can do for
my friends in one area, they should add something in another.

I AM happy for them, and have said so from the beginning.  Obviously, I
haven't made this point enough, although I feel like I've typed it a dozen
times.  I'm happy for them, I don't think the easy porting should be
removed, I think the easy porting is a good idea, but I think they should
add something to Druids (and maybe Wiz's as well, since they ONLY had burns
and TL's) to make up for the fact that one of their major contributions is
now no longer necessary.
