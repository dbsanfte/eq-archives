In the US it was retitled "Dead Alive", to avoid confusion with
another film named "Brain Dead".

And yes, it's one hell of a movie.  Undoubtedly the goriest
movie of all time, period.  And hilariously over-the-top.
Just when you think it can't outgross itself, it does, then
does it fifteen more times.

Warning, though, it was made on a budget of what looks like
twenty bucks, but that sort of just adds to the charm.
