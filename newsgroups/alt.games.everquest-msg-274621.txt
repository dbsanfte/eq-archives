hello all.
i'm looking at picking up EQ2 in the next few days.  In preparation i've 
been looking for some character creation guides online, but so far im not 
finding much other than a bunch of conflicting information.

does anyone know a good site that has correct information on class/race 
combos, class/race skills,  what each starting stat is used for, stuff like 
that.

thanks in advance.

lee
