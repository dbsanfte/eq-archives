How'd you get down here too? I grouped from Oasis on.. Not sure what level
but it was before level 20.

/agree

Such a nice alternative to LOIO. Quiet (!!!), no beggars, better loot (For
levels 20-25 anyway. Dunno about the higher level mobs..), a town in zone
(Really conveinent for those who cant gate or tp and are KOS/have low
faction in Paineel.)

Steamfront was a nice alternative to Oasis.Quiet (!!!), few beggars, guards
near where I was hunting (By the two windmills).
