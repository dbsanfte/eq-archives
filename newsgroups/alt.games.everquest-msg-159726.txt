Yes.  That's not what he did though, he'd - allegedly - already spent
300 AA points on every conceivable (decreased food usage, added CHA..)
thing he would want and had accumulated 100 more over and above this
with the intention of acquiring mucho PoP AA skills on the day of
release.  

However, I did hear a rumour that when you installed PoP and logged in
the surplus AA points didn't vanish until you zoned/camped, not sure
if this was correct or not though.
