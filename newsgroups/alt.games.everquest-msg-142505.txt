Yeah, no kidding. I ended up with six different Steeleye Span CDs
because of one MP3 file. The "song preview" snippets on CD-Now have
cost me quite a bit of money too.

I don't know, but it would be really interesting to watch. The better
question, though, is how much could they improve their own position?
The best way to damage a control freak, after all, is to thrive
outside his control.

Merit is a pretty meaningless concept anyway. I may not agree with the
people who like a given artist, but who am I to tell them their tastes
are invalid just because they don't match mine?
