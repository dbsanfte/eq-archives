Why bother with putting a browser in EQ anyway?  Just let us alt+tab out, 
already.

(Note: this is not a bitch simply because I keep having to alt+ctrl+del 
out of EQ everytime another program that I LIKE to leave running in the 
background thanksverymuch happens to give me a message box that my 
computer feels I absolutely positively MUST see before it is TOO LATE and 
boom back to the desktop I go just as a large angry Thug is running my 
way... but it sure would be NICE if one could simply click on 
"Everquest" and it'd pop right back up...)
