Actually, I know more people on other servers than I know on my own.  EQ is
big enough that if you know a lot of other gamers, there is a good chance
you'll meet people who play EQ, and there are enough EQ servers that the
chances are good that they won't be on your server.

There are at least three different servers people where I work are playing
on, for instance.

My guild is pretty much dead on my server, and I don't know anyone outside
it.  Meanwhile, one of the people I know from work has just started a guild
on another server.  They have regular groups, pretty much every night, at
around my level, doing the things that my character should be doing.  If I
wasn't having so much fun back in DAoC that I might never resume EQ, I'd be
paying to have my main moved over.
