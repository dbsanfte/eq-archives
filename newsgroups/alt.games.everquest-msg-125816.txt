I am not in the recruitment business. I would rather you all hate the
Bible because of what it actually means, versus glomming onto one word
and saying see, see!

you schtup a woman, you should expect to marry her. In those days, sex
and children were the same thing. I think that we may think that
knocking a woman up would mean you marry her. There were no child
support in those days either.

Unless I miss my mark, and regardless what she says, Lokari isn't a
witch. Jeff Dahlmer would qualify. A witch in those days usually
practices a form of necromancy, which involved live human sacrifice.
Unless Lokari is doing something she isn't talking about, she isn't a
Baal worshipper either. It's not about freedom of religeon, it's about
murder. Murder for the purposes of sorcery was more repugnant.

Yuk.

This is a cause and effect relationship. If you worship idols, you are
doomed. Think about the guy who worships his Lexus, isn't he screwed
spiritually? How about someone who plays EQ to the exclusion of
anything else. WHat is that person missing out on.

Mess with the downtrodden and opressed, and it is a sin which cries to
heaven.

Don't take money from people and doom them to poverty with business
practices that are preditory.

Dont talk bad about people from other lands, or thier gods. Notice
lower case, not God but other gods. It doesn't get you anywhere.

What to offer the church for it's upkeep, and don't eat meat that has
rotted in the sun. Yuk.
