  Going away for a while, coming back.  No, you cant have my
stuff, nor can you borrow my stuff.

   Lenny and I found that once he retired, we cannot afford to
live in San Diego anymore.  I got tired of deciding which bill I
was going to be blowing off this month (not the Everquest bill,
of course.  Kept my priorities straight).  So we're packing it
in.

   The nice thing about San Diego is that real estate prices are
insane.  We turned a nice little profit.  With luck, setting up a
new household in Missouri, the land where I found Lenny, will be
fairly easy.  But, until we do get set up, I won't be playing EQ,
and I don't know when I will be back on the newsgroup.

   We plan on rolling out next Saturday... I'm nervous!

Annie
