The "raiding culture"? You think that the only people in the game who
come across an epic cleric at some point and get a click stick rez are
in raiding guilds?

I'm not saying there's anything inherently wrong with it if a mid level
character never heard of the cleric epic effect, but I certainly find it
odd. It's pretty well ubiquitous in Norathian society. And in
particular, when one is a member of that class, you'd think curiousity
about their "ultimate quest" (*cough*) would have spurred an interest to
look it up or ask somebody.
