The items are Mt. Death Salts and Green Goblin Skin.

These items drop randomly off all Kunark Goblins so always plenty on vendors
at Mill (loio) FV, OT and Leezardville, death salts seem to drop off other
mobs from memory

Hand in 4 of each. Or to be quicker 4 stacks of 4. will take a stupendously
long time gaining the items from vendors though
