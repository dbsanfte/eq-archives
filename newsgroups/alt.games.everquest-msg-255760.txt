Generally I have to say Im not impressed.

Last night Stromm went down as I was doing a turn in for my cleric
epic quest.  Basicly what I had to do was get a crown, turn it into
npc #1, Then npc #2 spawns and kills npc #1,causing npc #3 to spawn
which I have to kill and get crown #2 to give to npc #2, who gives me
back a different item and tells me who to go see next.

All went well and fine till the very end when the server went down
just as I was getting my last instructions on who to go see next.
When I got back online I was time warped back a minute, I have crown
#2 with no way to make npc #2 spawn again.  It took me 3 hours to camp
the first crown and from what Ive read I got lucky. Normally its an
8-12 hour camp for this item.  

I sent in a petition (not the easiest thing to figure out how to do,
maybe this is why SOE can claim the number of petitions has gone down
since they put in the new system. No one can figure out how to send
one in), got a reply wihin 4 hours(Only good thing about this
experience was a speedy reply) that said "Unfortunatly, you will need
to wait for this npc to respawn and attempt this part of the quest
again."

Hmmm, either my post wasnt read carefully and the GM didnt understand
I had no way to get npc#2 to respawn or he meant I had to start all
over.  Either way seems to me to be an unacceptable answer.  When I
gave crown #1 to npc #1 the first time I was given some oil, its very
easy to see if I had done this by checking to see if I have the
oil,which I do.

If he meant I had to start all over and get a new crown thats very bad
service as far as Im concerned. It was thier fault this happened in
the first place.  I really dont relish spending another long afternoon
trying for this crown again.  What happens if I get unlucky this time
and Im sitting there for 12-15 hours? 

Do I have any other recourse over this or is the ingame GM the final
word on problems like this?
