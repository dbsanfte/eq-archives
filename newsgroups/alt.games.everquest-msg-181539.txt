When you zone into Kaesora, if you run straight, you will normally fall 
into a pit.

Where is the bottom of this pit?  I'm pretty familiar with Kaesora, but 
haven't had the pleasure of falling down this particular hole.

I'm trying to find a faster way to Xalgoz.  Normally, we zone, jump down 
left, go through the spider room, exit right, then turn left and jump down 
in the "broken room".  From there we take the tunnels to Xalgoz, sometimes 
jumping down the pit near the end to save a little time.

I'm hoping that with Lev and IVU, jumping down this first pit will take us 
to Xalgoz more quickly.
