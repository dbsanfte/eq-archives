Go faster than light?  This is a topic of great interest to me, so if you
have URLs of anything about this, I'd be grateful.  Of course, if you don't,
it doesn't mean it didn't happen, but I'd sure be glad to read about it if
it did.

I'm sure you don't mean that people have gone faster than light, but I am
aware of the search for particles, energy, and even "information" travelling
faster than light.

One finding of interest was of paired particles, where any influence on one
will be reflected in the behavior of the other, and where, with some space
between two such particles, an influence exerted on one was detected to
change the behavior of the other more quickly than a photon could have
travelled between them.  If I recall, the supporters of the idea that the
speed of light is the maximum possible speed had a reasonabe explanation,
although I cannot remember the specifics, or even whether I believed it.  To
the best of my memory, it was the concept of multiple existing universes,
where all possibilities exist, but where all possibilities collapse into a
single remaining universe at the instant of the event.

Others will point out that extremely fast particles, for example some
emissions within a reactor core, are  known to exceed the speed of light.
But this stems from a misunderstanding of the theory of relativity.  It does
not suppose the speed of light is the maximum speed in each medium, but only
supposes that the speed of light IN A VACUUM is the fastest any particle,
energy, or information can travel in any media.  In water, those particles
emitted from the reactor core do exceed the speed of light in water.  But
when the high energy particle reaches the vacuum of space, assuming it was
headed in that direction, a photon also emitted from the reactor core on a
parallel course would pass the particle literally as if the particle were
sitting still, with the exception that the photon, as detected from the
particle, would be red-shifted a lot.

Anyway, here's my take on the dogs and cats thing.  I suspect there is no
more absolute an answer to it than to the question of who was smarter
between Shakespeare and Mozart, or DaVinci and Isaac Newton.  Hell, just
keeping it within the animal kingdom in general, there seems to be some
controversy even among scientists which is smarter between a chimp and a
dolphin.  In the end, who gives a shit anyway?  I have had several cats,
including a kitten I was given only the other day, I have had many dogs, and
I cared greatly for all of them, regardless of which was the smartest.
