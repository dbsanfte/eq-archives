Well, there's always something you could try if you feel like taking a risk.
Die, loot all but one item so the corpse stays around, repeat....do this
until you are down to some level where you can get into an AoE group doing
blues, and spend a couple hours getting massive AA, then rush back and res
all your corpses before the timer runs out.  Repeat, and pray that you don't
run into any bugs or botch the time calculation. :-)
