Sure!!

I am not interested in making a profit at this time. I just want to
recoup (sp) my costs so that I can keep working on the skill. I can
make most pieces with ease except for gaunts, leggins, mantles, and
cloaks...trivial at 168-175. I can make the harder pieces as well, but
it might take a couple of attempts. I will be on tonight (Friday) and
most of the weekend. I want to skill up to 175 (trivial for Cloaks)
before the next patch day.

Just have them shoot a tell to Tavien (Hum and Barb languages only) or
Khosh (Hum, Barb, Elvish)
