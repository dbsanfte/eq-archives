Thats where the main mistake is . I DO NOT expect all of the old eq hands to
jump to eq2 . I expect VERY few will do so. What exactly are they offering
me that will make me be willing to give up characters I have been running
for 5 years?

I know that eq2 is either going to bomb horribly or have a semi forced
transfer from eq.
