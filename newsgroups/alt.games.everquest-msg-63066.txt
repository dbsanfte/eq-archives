Heck, those extra log files actually shows me how much slower it is.
It spends a minute checking my files, and unlike the old patcher, it
slows down everything else on my computer while it does that.

It's kinda scary to see a sub folder (the humanity!) in my everquest
folder, for the skin. It's also tempting to mess around with the skin
bmp's to see if I could get away with making a skin of my own :p

And it's still running a tiny, crappy looking window for _verQuest.exe
before running the patch. I miss my old patcher instead of this
bell-and-whistle waste of my time... I want to play the game, not
watch a purty display of how slowly the patching process can be
initiated. The exp bar look of it got old really fast.
