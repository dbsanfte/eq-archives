"Just" the Internet?

The Internet provides me with a paycheck, as well as several universities 
worth of libraries, more entertainment than cable, and free porn. What else 
is there in life?

Usenet has been around for longer than most of the Internet. It has a well-
established code of netiquette. If you don't like it, don't post.

Same thing as above.

It *is* irritating to some degree. I use abbreviations (cent, lego, etc) in 
battle, primarily. "Dorf" though is 1 letter shorter than dwarf, and sounds 
dumb. YMMV. 

>4. people begging for free stuff.

It's irritating. I work hard for my gear. If I am going to give it away, I 
am NOT going to give it away to a beggar.
