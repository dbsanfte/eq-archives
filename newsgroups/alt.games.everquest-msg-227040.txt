This must have been an anomaly of the last few groups that I was in. Most
recent LDoN mission was actually quite a bit more challenging. I still wound
up doing very little Slowing, but my nuking became much more strategic and I
was a lot more useful. I even used my Anathema DoT quite often. It's a very
decent little curse DoT that delivers 1400 damage over 5 ticks. I got pretty
good at seeing the following sequence of text:

<combat spam>
Your Anathema spell has worn off on your target.
<nuke>
You have slain your target

Winterfury Thunderwolf
Barbarian Luminary-Shaman of 56 Winters
Citizen of Firiona Vie, Dragonslayer
