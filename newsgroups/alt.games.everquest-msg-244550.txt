No, you don't do anything wrong. What you describe points to a problem
with the login server. There's nothing you can do about that.

Playing on Kael Drakkal I can say that nearly all of the text is
translated into german. In fact, your client will refuse to connect to
any of the localized servers until you set the correct language in the
patcher's option menu. And then it starts to download a whole lot of
files. Going back to your server would require you to update the
language again. So if you really want to play on both an english and a
non-english server I recommend two separate installations of EQ.
Oh, and chatting across servers is no problem but you won't be able to
link Items. Though they will show up as links clicking on them won't net
any result. :/
