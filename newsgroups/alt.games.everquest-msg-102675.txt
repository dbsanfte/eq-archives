One other useful comment:
You can't mem spells while feigning, but it's easy to forget them. (no
memming gate while feigned. I tried it. Got to gate, but not the way I
wanted to). Van't meditate either- it counts as standing.

Neat trick I learned- you can fish while feigned. Had to wait for a boat.
Thought I'd try.
