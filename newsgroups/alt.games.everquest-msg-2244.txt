While I wouldn't complain I'd question whether or not the onion was placed
there to cover a stench produced by a bad steak.

I think I understand where they guy is coming from.  I want to see more work
beign done on the game. Are the encouragign me to play something else?  If so,
perhaps I should look into other more role playing type games.
If they have to add little games to the expansions, why not a multiplayer card
game.  When I sit and med, it wouldn't be bad if I could sit with someone, or
group and play a little poker. )
