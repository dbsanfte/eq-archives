You can thank greedy old Mythic for that one. They sold a line that
the extra cost would go for increased CS (one of their many outright
lies), and given the evidence that people would pay it, Verant
followed suit.

Gas prices work the same way. One station increases price, they all
follow. Or, if its trending downwards, one station lowers price and
they all follow, but the mmorpg price is trending upwards.
