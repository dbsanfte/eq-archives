OK, what a horse gets you is:
- Standing meditation - if you are not moving (and not attacking), you are
  medding... even if you are halfway through a spell.
- Sets your running speed to some amount over the default standard. For
  the cheapest horse this is 25% over, and so is slower than SoW, JBoots
  and Run3. The SoW buff is *not* overwritten by the horse, but with the
  horse up you will run as horse speed rather than SoW speed.
- Horses ONLY WORK OUTDOORS. Fortunately there are some "outdoors" zones
  (such as PoJ) which are mostly indoors.
- MOBs see you as standing -> no sitting aggro. This is *incredibly* useful.
- Some safe fall skill. Not sure how much this is, but galloping along on my
  horse I've never taken fall damage as long as I was careful to avoid the
  obvious cliffs and such, even in zones where I would normally risk damage
  just by running at regular speed.

Disadvantages:
- Inertia - takes time to speed up/slow down. Personally I find this is
  rarely a problem, but clerics don't move around much anyway.
- The horse head gets in the way and makes it hard to target things. Not
  usually a big problem as most targeting is via /assist or F1-F6. Looting
  is a pain. If I can, I sit at the bottom of a hill, so that the horse is
  sloping down; this makes targeting much easier. The drogmor (lizard
horses)
  have low heads that do not obscure your view.

You can definitely get attacked on a horse. I've had the corpses to prove
it.

And they *are* actually fun to ride. Even when you see a bard running past
you backwards.

        ...Ronny
