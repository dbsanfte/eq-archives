There is a Treant in South Karana "Gristleknot" or something like
that, that I have not seen in 3 years of playing EQ (and levelling at
least a dozen characters in South Karana at one point or another).
There is also a "Glacier Cave Bear" in Everfrost under the ice river
that is about as rare. If memory serves the Treant is for the Totemic
Breastplate, and the Bear is for the helm. The crafted armor pieces
are much easier. On a normal server I was able to quest a complete set
of crafted with a 50 Druid in about 10 hours (using ports, tracking,
and about 1500pp for gems already in the bank).

I have spent most of my time on a regular server. (I haven't priced
the quested armor on FV). As an example you will spend close to 200pp
to quest the Totemic gauntlets (you will also need a smith to make
medium banded armor as a component for each piece), and on most
regular servers they sell for 75-100pp.

Many of the items you need to collect are "no drop" on regular
servers. On FV they are NOT "no drop" so you might be able to find
some of the rarer items in the bazaar. This means that you may also be
able to complete some of the harder items without having to fight
creatures that are too strong for your current level.

It really depends on how you want to play. The quests are fun to do,
and if you are into doing quests I highly recommend them. There is no
shame in buying the completed pieces if you can find them cheaper.
Also newer armors (such as Ry'Gorr from the Velious explansion) have
similar (or even better stats) and sometimes cost less in the bazaar.

I have taken a break from FV, but I plan to return soon. The 1
character per account limit makes it tough for me. There are just too
many race/class combos I like to fool around with. I am currently
exploring the differences between the races that can be Beastlords as
you can see from my sig :-)

I'll look for you online the next time I'm on FV.
