Well, you have your fellow players to thank.

Sony returned Channelling to a 'working state' as it was about a year 
ago, but people have gotten so used to being able to channel through any 
kind of incoming attacks that the player-base revolted and raised such a 
shit-storm that Sony are spending 5 hours backing it out, so they can 
review channelling and introduce a full fix.

As a result in it's current state, it's broken again.
