IRL I'm very nearly a HEF RNG so thats what I play.  It feels like home.

No, I don't cast spells or talk to animals, well except when they talk
to me first.  I don't swing a sword... I do like hanging out in the
woods/prarie.

is
precious little that is funnier than someone cursing in English when

aren't completely fluent in it. It's made even funnier when they're
apopleptic with rage, as Arnaud here is.--Brandon Blackmoor
