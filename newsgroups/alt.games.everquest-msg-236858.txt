From the shadows, the mysterious "Zanukan Guksbane"

Okay so far so good, to some extent anyways.

You're not outside of current scientific theory (well not really);
this is called the cyclic model.

You broke down here. "Very long period of time" does not make sense;
there is no time outside of the current universe.

What I suspect you mean, and perhaps 42 as well, is another dimension
above and beyond time. Well that is certainly possible - some theories
postulate many more than four dimensions now - but its not reasonable
to use that as evidence for the current theories being "miraculous" or
not being the theory with the least necessary entities, as David was
talking about.

Your theory does not take into account what "time" actually is. As I
said earlier, you're stuck in Newtonian physics.
