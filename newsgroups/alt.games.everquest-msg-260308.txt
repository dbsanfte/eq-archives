I think the SP2 vs Systems issues cause it to lock up once restarted, we 
just had to build some systems for a customer, all of them locked up, tried 
BIOS update, but alas, there was no update available, had to remove the 
board and put in a different brand.

Biz, I found this forum which mentioned a few other people who had similar 
problems, not sure what OS you got, but it may shed some light on it..
