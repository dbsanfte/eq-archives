All indications are that the Cyclops is a random spawn, and not
triggered.

Sure, there are lots of theories on how to make it spawn, but
I've tried them all, and none seem to work any better than
just clearing Sand Giants and the Terrorantula (as possible
placeholders).

Most of the theories on how to make the AC spawn seem an awful
lot like, "well, this is what I happened to have been doing
the last time it decided to spawn, so it MUST be the trigger..."
