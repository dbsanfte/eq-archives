Our chanters seemed to be quite busy keeping the her various guards in
a mezed state, since we observed that if we killed them they respawned
almost immediately.  I imagine puller her to zone would get around that to
some extent though.

Having a volunteer become her pet does seem like an elegant solution...except
that she appeared to be quite capable of maintaining several pets at any one
time.  She also hit hard enough that I'd be pretty worried that chanter
volunteers
would become rezable before she got around to charming.
