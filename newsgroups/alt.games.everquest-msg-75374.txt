any "good" city...too many to name. there may be other places as well...I'm a
high elf though, so I can't say for sure

you can bind yourself, and others, at level 12. You must be grouped with someone
to bind them, and you can only bind others in city zones, or other specified
spots (for example : Kaesora, in Field of Bone, the gypsy camp, in North Karana,
the entire Arena zone off of Lake Rathe, etc...)

you get your first self ports at level 20. the spells are purchased at various
locations - check http://eq.castersrealm.com for specifics

hell levels are levels 30, 35, 40, 45 and 51+
they are the same for all classes. they are levels where the experience gain to
level is significantly larger than all others

I am a wizard. this is true to some extent, because some people don't realize
the damage that wizards can do, if the class is played properly
make friends, keep a good reputation, and get that reputation out there.

wizards are very limited in what they can wear. mainly cloth..some leather type
armors
raw silk is player made..sometimes sold to vendors. your best bet is to have a
tailor make it for you.
making money is relatively easy, but can be difficult at lower levels...kill
things, loot them, and either sell them to players or merchants (silk, bone
chips, bat wings, and pelts can usually be sold to players, as they are needed
for either spell components or tailoring). there's also the Lightstone quests
(see http://everquest.allakhazam.com for details)

no. meditate will go up very quickly on its own. save your skill points for
research (a pain to raise through actual use of the skill) and trade skills (you
don't HAVE to do trade skills, but there is a very nice series of quests in
Velious that require decent trade skills)

hope that was helpful in some way...
