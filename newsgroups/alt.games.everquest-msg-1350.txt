I guess I was a bit ambiguous.  I meant, "Even if it (the player's
name) was spelled with a "c" instead of a "k"."

Sure, I've heard of "Flick my Bic" (about 20 years ago, was the last
time), but it's still a stretch nonetheless.  Might as well petition
all those mage, necro, enchanter, shaman, and druid pet names with
"bik" or "bic" in 'em.  Hmmm.  Never seen 'em but I assume the cleric
animated hammer pets would be the same.
