What is not racial about saying that "Jews" run the movie business?  There
are far more Christians in the US, so does that mean that I can say that
Christians basically run the company?  Many PEOPLE work in the movie
business...Jewish, Catholic, Mormon, Islamic...it doesn't matter.  They are
all just people, and they all make good and bad movies...so stop making it a
religion issue.
