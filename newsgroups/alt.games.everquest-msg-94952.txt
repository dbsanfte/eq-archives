Grats!

I had a serious dropoff in enthusiasm when I hit 60. What was left to
do? I came up with:

- get all my spells (now only missing Legacy of Thorn from Norrath and
a ton from Luclin)

- Coldain Shawl 7 (currently working on 6)

- VP key (got it a few days ago)

- visit every zone in the game (currently working on faction with the
uber guild so they'll take me to VP)

- better equipment (have gotten hiero cloak, ooiv, lodizal shield
since 60, my ToV armor set is still missing a bracer and some boots,
still haven't gotten that darn talisman of benevolence)

- pull more dragons (I've pulled and helped kill Sev, Gore, Talendor,
Myga and Yeldema. I've helped kill Trak but didn't pull him obviously)

- lots of guild-related stuff (e.g. killed Velketor, working on
killing Vindi, Zland, Vaniki, etc.)

Good luck!
