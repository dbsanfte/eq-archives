/q does not clear agro, it makes you LD, turning you into Mr. Mob meat for
a few minutes.  /camping should, within reason clear agro, but make you
temporarily easy pickens for 30 seconds while trying.  Thing about fear...
When breaking in, is to have some groups that can deal out damage quick and
good communication.  Chanters are a must.  Not cause they can mez, but also
for their rune spell to give the main assist and melees a chance to take a
few good blows before it starts to hurt, giving the other groups a chance
to work in as well.
