After 2.5 years I still get confused by /loc on occasion.  I ALWAYS have to
think "ok, first number is north, 2nd is west."

DAOC's loc system is much worse though. I think the first number is how far
east you are (not bad), 2nd is how far south (ugh).  And their numbers wrap
(in Hibernia, anyway).
