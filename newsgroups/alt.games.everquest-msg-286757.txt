No no, thats not my objection.

I know perfectly well why it could be.

BUT I also know that there are several different possibilities:

Server is down due to a crash

Server is down due to a patch

Server is up but something is wrong with my connection/ISP

Server is up and there's congestion preventing me from getting in.

Each has a different response... but all look identical from the 
position of someone trying to log in.

If my response to all of the above was the same, then the difference 
between them would merely be of academic interest.  But since there are 
different responses, finding out which is the case becomes useful.

SOE's failure to clearly communicate what they're doing is therefore not 
merely lazy and irritating to those who are interested from mere 
curiosity, but actually annoying to those who would like to log in as 
soon as possible, and contrapositively to not waste their time trying 
the brute force method of repeatedly clicking to see if they can slip 
past congestion.

Some of the info -is- out there, just in stupid places.  Other 
information apparently remains unavailable entirely.  Both would be easy 
to take care of by someone spending a few minutes during any patch/crash 
to update the simple pages they already have in place.
