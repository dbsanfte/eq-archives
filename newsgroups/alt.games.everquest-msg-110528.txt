Well, I'm not overly fond of Plato, and I positively detest the prefix
"neo" with or without a hyphen, so I'm not ready to adopt your suggested
jargon.  And if you think I was too long, try reading modern writings
about the philosophy of language, it'll make your teeth itch and your
hair ache just plowing through the preface, the essays themselves are
often capable of leaving you dazed and confused for hours while only
rarely providing some small germ of a new thought that might perhaps
partially compensate you for all the pain.  And that last monstrosity
of a sentence is pretty short and very straightforward  in comparison
to what I endured routinely during the brief time that I tried studying
late 20th century philosophical writings.

Well, my argument has nothing to do with whether any particular
individual does or does not accept this hypothetical universal good
and/or universal evil, so your argument unravels at its source.

You are being overly broad.  I see no causal connection there.

I did not intend to imply that you were, nevertheless I welcome
your refusal to do so.  :)
