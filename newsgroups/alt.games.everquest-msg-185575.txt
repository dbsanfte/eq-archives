Everything has been improved. Some of the quests now are truly epic in 
scope (and I'm not talking just about the epic weapons, the Coldain Ring 
quest wars are cool as hell), the graphics are improved, low-level 
leveling has been made MUCH easier, it is far easier to get good 
equipment at lower levels, travelling is cake now if you have PoP, there 
are far more zones to explore at all levels, etc. The list goes on.

I just started back after an almost 2 year absence, having previously 
played end-game content on both Kunark and Velious expansions and I'm 
having a blast starting all over with a new account/char with the new 
expansions of Luclin and PoP (haven't bought LoY yet). If you enjoyed EQ 
before, I suspect you will enjoy it even more now.
