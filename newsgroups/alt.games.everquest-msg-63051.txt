Everquest does no registry stuff, in fact you can copy your entire EQ
dir onto cds and later dump it into a dir after you reformat and put
your new operating system on a virgin computer.

So you are shooting in the dark because you don't know why your
connections are inferior. Find some other reason because eq has
nothing to do with connecting to your isp.
