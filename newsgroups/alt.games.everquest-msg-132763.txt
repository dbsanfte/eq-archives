Sitting are a good way of single pulling, my monk use sit pulling to 
pull the Bloodgills in IllOmen, work like a charm. I go near one of the 
2 spawns and hit one, i get both. I go near one and get aggro, the other 
one aggro me too.
But sit just outside aggro range, on the opposite side of the mob you 
dont want, a few sec later i have 1 mob.
