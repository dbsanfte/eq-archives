A man of faith!

/salute

If both your assumptions are correct, it still doesn't mean
they'll fix it anytime soon.  At a guess they'll go live,
generate huge outcry from the general public and (maybe)
be changed in an emergency patch.

the quote from the patch message means that the ZEMs must
be at least 122, or the math simply doesn't work (assuming
they are 145 now, which I think is correct).  Still the
best xp in EQ, as they should be for zones that require the
group organization of PoP zones.
