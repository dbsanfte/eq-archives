the spell lookup utility from www.eqcasters.com is very handy although
doesnt have detailed information.

For finding groups you have to go where there's people. When i was Lv14 i
stuck to Crushbone all the way through to lv20.  There's always an
abundance of people in this zone so just hang around and put out /ooc 14
BST LFG.  

20-25 i was in Paludal again usually lots of ppl.

Then 25- low 30s High Hold Keep then move to Dawnshroud Peaks.

There's maybe better places for XPing but i always found it OK finding
groups which is more important.

If you've got the PoP expansion then PoK is always teeming with people 25+
so look for groups there as well

Theres also a plugin you can download (via eqatlas website) that brings up
a map in game.  You have to download the jpegs first though.

If your running XP and want to go down the alt tab route then you may need
to get the instructions on how to achieve this from the eqlive website. 
(it basicly involves telling XP that eq is an application that can be
trusted to alt tab)

the information about zones on eqatlas is also very good and worth reading
up on new zones.
