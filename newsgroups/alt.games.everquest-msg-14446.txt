No, that would be stupid.  Yes, I do have all of my passwords
recorded, but there isn't a human alive who can get to 'em easily.
They are all recorded in digital format, encrypted behind yet another
password that is, again, a random string of numbers, letters and
characters.  This password I have memorized, using the amazing
supercomputer that the good Lord was kind enough to bless me with upon
my birth... my brain.

I don't often need to refer to this file, because I actually make an
effort to memorize most of my passwords.  I'm not going to say it's
easy all the time, but the human mind can remember a large number of
8-15 character strings and associate them with particular programs and
games.  It just requires discipline and some effort.

This is an approach for the security conscious, and I'll admit I'm a
bit more cautious than I really think is needed.  But, I'm in the
habit of using random strings for any important passwords, so I'll
just keep doing so.

Also, I don't let Windows autofill any of my PW's.  That's just asking
for trouble.  :)
