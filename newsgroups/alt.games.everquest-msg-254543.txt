Depends on what you mean by "true newbie". I just recently started 
playing EQ for the first time ever. However, I've also played UO, AC, 
DAoC, Neocron, SWG, CoH and beta tested Horizon, Wish and others. I'm 
well aware of what a main and alt is. ;)

I'm of the opinion that the newbie *worth* helping is the newbie that 
doesn't ask for it.
