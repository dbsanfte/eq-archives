There are two ways to get the Koalindl fish.  You can either take the long
route with the regurgatonic quest, or you can just go to the pool in Qeynos
and kill the fish yourself.

The problem is that you take a huge faction hit for killing the fish, so you
can either pay a newbie to kill it and let you loot the corpse, or (this is
what I did) you can create a mule to kill the fish, and then log in your
main char to loot the corpse.
