    Or just drop the number of counters. Plague Mites puts 72 freaking
disease counters on a level 65 character. That's four casts of Purify Blood
or Blood of Nadox, or two casts of Abolish Disease. Radiant Cure III can
only strip 16 of the counters. Purify Soul, the "strip all evil" AA ability,
can JUST get rid of this (it clears 72 disease counters). This wouldn't be
so bad if it weren't for the way the traps are implemented, and how easy it
is to get the effect multiple times.

    Box traps also can go off on failed rolls to disarm, and from
inspection. I've seen an INT caster set off a box trap casting his remove
traps spell on a box.

    If I'd seen 25% augment, even the +6 stat/resist ones, I'd be happy to
open them. In my experience, it's been closer to 10% augment, 25% vendor gem
(black sapphire-quality), 65% coins or 5 pp-sellable. If my groups weren't
robust, I'd never touch a chest.
