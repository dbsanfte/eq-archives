Heh... so in other words, you dealt 22.78 DPS -with- Shaman buffs, Yaulp 5
(25% Hasted added), and Celerity (50% Haste)? With a grand total of 75%
Haste, that's impressive for a Cleric, but nothing for a Paladin. It looks
like Cleric melee really isn't as powerful as everyone believes it to be...
just flashy. :b

As for Haste increasing proc-rate, it does... but indirectly. Haste
increases your amount of attacks, which increases the chance to proc more
per fight. Makes sense?
