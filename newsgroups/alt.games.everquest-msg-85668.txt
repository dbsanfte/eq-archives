 I used to think that it was annoying. Especially if you end up having
to roll on an epic piece against someone who just wants to MQ it.
However, I doubt Verant will ever classify MQ as an exploit. If they
don't like it they would have said so by now or at least made changes to
the quests. Which they have done to an extent with the containers that
you have to combine stuff in and then turn in.
