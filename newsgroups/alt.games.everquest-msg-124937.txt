It is a slightly grey area, not purely back and white.

I know where the mobs do and don't go in the zones I regularily hunt in - I
will med afk all the time in a spot out of mob pathing. Hmmn - nearly pure
white.

When I pull a mob to fight, I normally pull them to an area where I know
where they will deathmarch too, and if it can be arranged that will be
nowhere as the mob is trying to run flee into a zone line or other obstacle
Little bit grey.

Sometimes I will even  pull a critter over a pathing hiccup (the ones that
make them turn 180' and run back a few steps before resuming the chase) if I
need time to land a spell. Getting darker....

In real life it would be no different. I would not stroll upright through a
firefight - I would be using the terrain for whatever advantage I could
possibly get.

Still - even my pickled brain knows that a spot where you can deal damage to
a mob without the mob having a chance to do damage back to you is going to
be considered an exploit. That one doesn't take too much figuring out: black
as night.

Each person proberly has a different idea where tactics end and exploiting
starts so there is always going to be shit fights over it, so that's why I
reckon if you want to /bug and /report something - do it once and move on.
We are just the players, not the umpires, people should just make their
case, than grab a beer and chill out.
