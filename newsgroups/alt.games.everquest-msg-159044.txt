Tradeskills can suck a lot of cash out of the economy as well.

First, most tradeskills require a lot of vendor-purchased raw
materials for skill-up practice, and not return nearly as many
coins when selling back the results.

Worse, when you buy costly vendor materials to make a tradeskill
item for sale to a player, even if you come out ahead on the
sale, the coins you paid to the vendor for the materials are
out of the game permanently, whereas the coins you got in payment
for the item have merely changed hands -- they didn't suddenly
enter the game and balance out the expenditures you made on
the materials.

For example:  You pay 500p in materials for several attempts
at a Solstice Robe before you succeed, then sell the robe
for 2000p to a player who is working on the earring quest...

*You* may end up with a 1500p net gain in coins, but the
player economy as a whole just lost 500p in coins down the
vendor-hole without "creating" any.
