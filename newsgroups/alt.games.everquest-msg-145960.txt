	Not one of these zones is a pick-up zone, NOR DO YOU WANT THEM TO BE.  Do
you REALLY want to join a pick-up group to fight level 55 mobs?  Do you REALLY
want your pre-made group of guildmates to have to compete for camps against
people who train the zone every five minutes because they have the combat
skills of celery?

	Plus this brings back all the frigging problems with class balance.  I
didn't care that Rangers are fourth in melee damage and dead last in tanking
(BEASTLORDS tank better!) because I could always go solo for my experience.
Now it's going to be back to spending better than half my time LFG someplace?

	Of course, as usual it's the fighters who get reamed.  Casters have always
been able to solo larger targets so this will affect them less.  AE groups
will get less experience per mob but that just means they only advance 10
times faster than everyone else instead of 20.

|Hell, there's actual named mob camps in The Deep, but up until now

|shards/serubane components/the zone-in.

	There is a reason why people did not go to those camps: THEY SUCK.  If
they didn't, people would have done them.

|    Oh, and there's one camp in FG that'll still have people at it, if
|they're smart. ;-)

	Can't think of what it would be, except perhaps the Shik'nar, which I
don't want to mess with.

	Just when we thought The Vision was dead, we get hit with this fascist
shit.  How dare people -- especially fighters! -- gain experience without
grouping!  Back in your place!
