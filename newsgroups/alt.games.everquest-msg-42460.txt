Parrying dagger is actually a shield with a dagger graphic.  There are
many different opinions on what to dual wield.  My rogue went with two
daggers for the most part.  I was using a gnoll hide lariat for a while
in off hand, until I got a second magic Piercer, as my rogue was my
main, and thereby untwinked.  At 41 my rogue is using a slime coated
harpoon and a crystal grinder, in main/off respectively.  I also will
occassionally swap in a tombcarver to the off hand, for the lower delay,
depends on whether i am grouped with someone who can cast haste on me,
as I don't have any haste items yet.
