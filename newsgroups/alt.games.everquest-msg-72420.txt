In addition to the other answers you've received, yes. The *specific*
name of a mob can make all the difference in the world. Verant, in their
infinite wisdom and inexplicable sense of humor, have put a bunch of
mobs in the game with almost identical names but quite different
propreties. One of the earliest you run into is in Oasis. You can fight
"an orc warrior" and do quite well. Then you suddenly run into "a orc
warrior" and he takes your lunch money and makes you cry. The commons
are awash in "skeleton" mobs who are little nothings. THen you can
wander into the back section of Najena and meet "a skeleton". He's about
fifteen levels higher and conned blue to my warrior up till the high
thirties. Watch the names closely. I'm not saying the capitalized
versions of sarnaks you ran into fall into this class, but be careful
just the same.
