I think so, yes, for non-twinked melee types who like to solo...  In
fact ANY class that likes to solo.  There are times it is hard to get
a group, and there are times you just want to solo a while.

For groups, it will also end up freeing valuable mana for other duties
than just healing, thereby making the caster's life more interesting -
continuously casting heals and sitting gets very boring.  Yes, clerics
are the game's healers (and to not quite as good a degree, druids,
shamans, etc.), but maybe they want to try other tactics too!

It will make things more interesting for melee types who, even when
bandaged to 50%, have to sit for ages to get to full hp.  My little
monk is going to love this, in a very big way  :)  My rogue, too, in
all likelihood.

Could well be, but I'll see how it pans out.  At least if it IS
exaggerated, it isn't a nerf this time!

As you imply, the "heavily twinked" part makes a *huge* difference.  I
have no characters who are heavily twinked, and they all slog through
the hard way, not relying on uber-kit to take the strain. 

Not to imply that you are THIS twinked, I once witnessed a lvl 7
character in PC, at the bandit camps, pulling the odd one or two solo,
beside our group.  We all chuckled and thought he'd be mob-fodder in
no time, but with his Fungi Tunic and other uber-kit (duly linked and
bragged about and inspected by two of our group) he wasn't getting hit
due to phenomenal ac and if he *did* get hit he healed fast/took
little damage anyway.  Not really the spirit of the game...

>now meleeing solo up to the mid fourties.
Yes, agreed.  Soloing looks a bit less of a "sit and wait and fall
asleep" kind of thing.
