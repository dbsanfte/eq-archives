This is one of the few cases where I am going to think verant might be right.
I would believe that the GM spawned Kerrafym "accidently".  Thus until a
group/guild/raind can successfully kill the last warden we will never know how
the two entities interact.  I will say that I think the zone is complete to the
extent Verant's testing team has taken it.  Do I think if the quest/events are
going to correctly spawn/trigger/reward?  Probably not and the first group to
do it without "exploit" is going to get screwed.  But I think this is a good
enough case of, the first time it happens the gorup won't survive so they can
make fixes/tweeks in the next patch.

Just my 2 cp.
