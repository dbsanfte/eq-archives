he should of checked the prices more thoroughly.  basically he wasted 150
plat.  don't know if that implies female or male.  typical mistake.  I
wonder how many hours upon hours it took him to collect that much plat?  I
don't think its really a newbie mistake either.  Almost everyone overpays
sooner or later for something.

I check prices thoroughly myself and bought a item that I had to resell at a
loss, although I have certainly made more plat than I have ever lose.    I
was also looking for a bladed thulian claws and was wasting my time ( which
I figured was more precious than the cost for the claws), so I offered 500
plat for one which was like worth 150.  suddenly I had people in the zone
who were willing to sell what I was looking for.  :)
