Yerwhat?  The only illusions gore doesn't like are wolfies, werewolfies, 
and elementals (hmm, and I haven't tested imp form).  If it makes you look 
like another PC race, it's just fine.  And it has nothing to do with your 
religion.  Did you mean 'agnostic, because only agnostics and followers of 
dark gods have high enough faction with the outpost to start with'? I'm 
not sure that's true either.  The outpost seems to like elemental 
illusions... look forward to chanters getting that new AA I've been 
hearing about. 

But note that Gorenaire and Tektite are on opposite factions.  In fact, I 
believe kiling gore wil raise your faction (very slightly) with Tektite.
