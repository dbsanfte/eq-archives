I don't think it reduces fizzles, could be wrong.

Once one reaches 51, you have chosen that as your specialization, and all
others will cap at 50.

Evocation and Alteration are generally the best choices for a druid.

One thing that was not mentioned here.  I understand that you must train one
point in all of them if you want any of them to go over 50.

As a shaman who soloed a lot at the time, I put a lot of training points
into Evocation, as, at the time, I used DD spells.  Fortunately, despite
that, Alteration was the one that went over 50 first.  Cannibalize uses
Alteration, and that is the single spell that I find I cast more than any
other spell, by far.  At 54, I rarely solo, I usually play a twink if a
guild group is not available.
