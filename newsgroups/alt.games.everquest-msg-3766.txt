To be honest, I think this game is rather pricey-- probably the most
expensive online game you ever play.(You hardly find any playstaion2,
dreamcast online games charge any online service fee at all) If Sony
distribute the game for free, solely charge the customers for online play, I
think that'll be a fair deal. But the fact you have to pay for the game as
well as any future add-ons + monthly service free. If you've a chance to
return it, you better do it right away. Sony doesn't protect your credit
card info at all , especially if you've a large credit limit you should feel
concern about it.
