"Except for raids" really sums up the under-45/over-45 split quite nicely. 
Yeah, it's possible to raid under-45, and even quite fun, but over-45 is
when you get to go on raids on stuff that *has* to be raided.  Enchanters
get an easy 51+ transition, but approaching 55 and particularly approaching
59/60 enchanters on raids shift roles drastically.  You're no longer the
crowd control you were in Hate/Fear/Chardok/Sebilis, now you're a buff
bitch.  There's places you still get to play CC some, but mostly enchanters'
CC spells don't get memmed much at that level.

I honestly (and maybe elitist-ly) don't figure in exp camping in any way in
my appraisal of the classes.  Throughout my leveling on multiple characters
exp'ing has been a side point.  Who I group with, or even whether I group,
also a side point.  Strangely enough, after getting up to 50+ with so many
characters and raiding in so many roles, I find myself grinding much like I
raid (which scares the hell out of the occasional random non-guildmates I
pick up to fill a spot).  Exp'ing only has two roles to play, damage and
keeping us alive, and you'd be amazed at what classes can do which when
necessary.  :)

There's morons at any level of the game.  The guy that leaves a trail of
corpses from his bind point to the trainer at level 1 will *eventually* get
to 60 if he keeps plugging away.

As far as raid differences, some are subtle, some are huge, but very few
raids qualify as "just do this like we do Naggy".  Naggy doesn't need a CH
chain, nor off-tanking (unless you charge in with FGs up, which might be
kinda fun actually), nor concentrated aggro reduction and/or aggro increase,
nor does he Trak touch, Dain banish, curse, slow, DT, flux, or hit for more
in one round than your highest-HP tank has, or any of the other little
things that makes *people* find their role to play on a specific raid.

Yes, I know some level 60 enchanters (and all other classes) that still play
just like they did at 16, some level 60s that never stopped grinding long
enough to raid.  For *those* people, the game doesn't particularly change,
this is true.  But those people are restricting themselves to a small subset
of the game I play.

Everybody gets added abilities when they level, that's built into the game. 
Not everyone takes full advantage of those added abilities, and that's the
"skill" of EQ.
