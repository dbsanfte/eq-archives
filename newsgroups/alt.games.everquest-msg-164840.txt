Played this Star Trek game on the apple 2. The one plotted a graph,
kinda fun. On the Commodore it was Bards tale followed by the post
holocaust version of Bard's tale (it used the bard's tale interface);
anybody remember what that title was? All I remember was one of the
battle text was something along the lines of <creature X> explodes
like a blood sausage. Ahh the good old days. :-)
