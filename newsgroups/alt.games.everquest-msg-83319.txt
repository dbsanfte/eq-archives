If you have the bard with you I would recommend hunter/forager cycle in 
Trak's Teeth, though you may have trouble with the named when they pop.  
You could do Emerald Jungle, since the bard can easily track and pull 
singles, but you may run out of dark blue mobs.  I know they started to 
thin out about level 53 and were completely gone by level 56.
If it's just the two of you, get your butts down to Lower Guk, dead side.  
It may take a bit of work, but you should be able to either clear your 
way down or just buff at the ent, med to full, invis undead down to 
whichever room you want, and clear out the room.  Since you're both good 
against undead, you should be able to hold a single room pretty easily, 
and probably one or two more rooms if your bard friend joins you.
Another good place would be Burning Woods, lots of blue to 50 mobs there, 
don't need tracking to find them, and you can pull them to secluded areas 
pretty easily
