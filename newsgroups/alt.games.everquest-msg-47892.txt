   A pair of 256's.  He was giggling alot when I paid for them,
but they weren't that expensive, around $60 or so.

   I assume this has something to do with Steven's giddiness.
Its alot cheaper than having him get some overly expensive
sportscar.

    I don't know what speed the computer is, but
he tells me its "adequate".  I'm assuming that that
is something of an understatement.  

A quick look through "My Computer" leads me to
believe that we have a ADM 756 Athlon Processor.
Can't find what sort of video card we have, 
though, but it is better than what we original
had (he says), and what we had wasn't exactly
crap.  And we are on a cable modem, so no 
hugh worries there.

            interested in maxing out her machine
            anymore...it's good enough now.
