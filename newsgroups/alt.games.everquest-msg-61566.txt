Of course the items I most want to sell are the ones I can't equip,
so unless they add the ability to inspect the inside of my containers,
this isn't going to be too useful.

Hmm, now if they set it up not to look at my inventory, but at a store
list like the vendors have, showing just my tagged items, that would
make more sense.

Better believe I'm interested in doing this, really eager to see how
the details play out.
