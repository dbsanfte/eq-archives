Sadly, I must agree.  It's still an improvement tho.

It's too late for EQ, but I'd sure like to see a game interface that
seriously impeded 'botting.  EQ relied on taking over the machine,
which has failed.  But there are other approaches that could be used.
It's a complex problem, the only "silver bullet" I can see amounts to
unconditional surrender (i.e. the dedicated hardware of a console
game).  But the game"rules and interface could be designed in such
a way as to make scripted 'bots painfully obvious (ban them!  ban
them all!) and to make characters without a dedicated player behind
them much less effective.
