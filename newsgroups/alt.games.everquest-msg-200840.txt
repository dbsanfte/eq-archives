I'm really curious to see how bards turn out in EQ2, and if twisting
is any part of the class.

Back to the original topic - I witnessed a 65 bard today who was the
most incredible player, regardless of class, I've ever seen - she 
chain pulled, slowed mezzed, melee'd, got some time with the high
level cantata and Rizlona's (spell damage increaser that stacks with
my bracer - FoT hit for 2500 :)  With just 5 of us we were easily
running out of mobs in FC (Front Cave in PoV), then she'd pull the
undead vassals and any frogs and worms she could find.  We were 
fighting non-stop.  I would have gotten 10blue in 63 today, except
I LD'd and rolled back far enough to lose 1.5 or so blue of XP (!)
all in about 3 hours because of her.
