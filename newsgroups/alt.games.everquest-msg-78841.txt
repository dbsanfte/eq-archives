As an experiment , my hunting buddy  and I tried to take down a Sand Giant
in Oasis,  (40 Halfling Warrior / 35 Dwarf Paladin).

To be blunt we made a sad cock of it, and the giant kicked my head in, we
are going back tonight for a second bout.

Can anyone offer any tactical advice? - other than run away sooner :)

We have only the basic stuff for the level, (Crafted etc, for me) is this
possible or do you think we both should get more levels? - or infact give it
up as we are obviously shite :)

Naddo - 40th Halfling of Steel...soon to be 39 at this rate.
