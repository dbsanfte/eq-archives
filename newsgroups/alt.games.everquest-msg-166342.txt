Like I mentioned before, if you've nothing of consequence to say, then
dood speak is an excellent way to disguise that fact.

However, if you start with the premise that the purpose of
communication is to convey information, then clearly there is
something wrong with choosing a method that specifically prohibits
that result.

As always, a pleasure to see such a robust example of higher reasoning
and sound logic. You should get yourself on a debate team where your
skill can be put to their fullest use.
