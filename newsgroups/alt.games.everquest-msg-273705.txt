It died before that, really.  Velious began to kill them, and Luclin 
finished them off.  Prior to Velious, the difference between a top-end 
guild raider and a casual player was maybe 20% more mana or hps.  After 
Velious, the gap started to widen.  With Luclin, the gap changed into a 
chasm... and the smaller guilds suddenly couldn't keep up with the content.

When modrods were nerfed, that was the death knell for the smaller 
guilds who liked to raid... suddenly, you needed quite a few clerics to 
keep up with the damage whereas before you could get away with 2-3.
