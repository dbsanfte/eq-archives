"&nbsp" without a semicolon is broken.  Some browsers will guess that you
meant "&nbsp;" and act is if the semicolon were there.  The best thing you
can do is get away from HTML and instead use XHTML.  That will still display
fine in existing browsers, but you can use a validator to check your
documents for you and spot things like that, and missing close tags, and
other mechanical errors.

Converting from HTML to XHTML is pretty straightforward.  There's a pretty
good short tutorial on XHTML at www.w3schools.com.
