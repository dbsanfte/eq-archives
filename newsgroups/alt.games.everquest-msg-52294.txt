Well for one thing he means Crafted Vambracers, not the Pauldron. The
Pauldron needs the 3 Dwarf Runes from Evil Eyes, and is one of the rarer
Crafted pieces. 200pp for the Vambracers is about right because Griffon Eyes
are a dime a dozen and the crafted quests are far too old to make a profit
on any more.
