I just dinged 12 with my chanter, and I was hoping for some advice
regarding how my gem slots should be utilized. I read another post on
the topic, but it mainly addressed much higher level spell books than
mine.

Also, I am still a bit unclear on pets (animations) and charmed mobs
as they relate to xp awarded.

If a pet does 50% of the total dmg to a mob, they get 50% xp as I
understand it. Does this apply to group situations too? Therefore,
chances are slim that the pet would do 50% on a mob in a group and
should be a welcomed additional damage dealer/chanter bodyguard I
would think.

In addition, how is xp awarded when a charmed pet is used?

Thanks.
