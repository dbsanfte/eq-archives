    What server, just out of curiousity?

    I'm sure many of the HG's ive been killing have popped right in front of
me before i snare them, and ive had see-invis spells on most of the time and
would've noticed anyone running up to the HG.... in fact the life expentancy
of these giants is so short i find the rogue theory really hard to believe!
Can they evade my see-invis spells? I'll check /who next time to see if
rogues are about...

Regards,
James
