Rogues CAN solo, they're just arguably the worst at it than other
classes.  Rogue soloing is COMPLETELY dependent on gear,
whereas a half-ass played wizard (mine) can solo a single blue
naked-with-Tboots with 0% chance of death barring LD or lag.

A rogue has enough damage output with good weapons to completely
kill a blue mob.  The trouble comes in as a hitpoint over time issue.
Whereas a monk can tank and bind and mend to get up almost to
full health, and a warrior can bind wounds high enough to kill a blue
mob STARTING from 50% health, a rogue needs to be 95%-100%
health before even attempting to take on a blue.  Without some sort
of good gear to get the hps back in an efficient amount of time (Fungi
tunic, Mrylo/Thurg/Kael/SS/PoG/etc BP, Iksar Regen tunic, AA regen,
etc), the rogue won't be able to solo efficiently at all.  Sure, he can
kill a blue and bind to half (and later 70% or maybe even higher with
AA skills), but then he's going to have to sit to get back to full so that
he can ATTEMPT to take down another blue.

Again, gear can help.  With the self 50% haste belt from the THO
and the spikecoat girdle from Tunare, my 60 rogue can tank good
AA exp mobs without slowing down.  Add in the regen from a couple
of items, and the fact that right-clicky Mrylo BP has a 6 second cast
time (instant recast), and he's got a downtime regen of 90 hps/tick.
Most of the time, AA mobs don't even get him down to 90%, during
which he can look for another (while regenning) before getting wary
after 2 or 3 and healing to full from 40%-50%.

Rogues CAN solo.  It only comes efficiently though by soloing very
specific mobs and only with some very good gear.  Tanking is
even survivable on a raid, as long as Nimble or Counterattack
don't run out before the main tank regains aggro :-).
