You are close to the fundamental truth, but you are too specific. The
real truth is:

Females in general = bad news


Did anyone see the recent tell-all show on HBO with Monica Lewinsky?
Oh my god, I've never heard such a vomitus of female rumor-mill
bullshit in all my life. All these women running around in the white
house, playing their little sex/power games, plotting to hang on to
semen stained clothing because of it's future power value, was just
sickening. The recorded conversations between Lewinsky and Tripp are
monuments to the evil of gossiping manipulating women.
