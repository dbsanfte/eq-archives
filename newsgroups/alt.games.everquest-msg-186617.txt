OTOH:  The boat used to be an opportunity to socialize.  There were always
lots of passengers.  Now, you're lucky if you are not alone.  I fished on my
last trip on the boat.

Personally, I just think there should be a price.  That book pedestal should
be inside a building.  To get to it, you have to pay the nice wizard that
keeps the thing going with his special magic.  Don't want to pay the wizard?
Walk.  Kill the wizard?  Walk, because the pedestal doesn't work without the
wizard.  It would have been more realistic, and would have established a
fair market price for player wizards to sell ports.

Cheers,
Eric
