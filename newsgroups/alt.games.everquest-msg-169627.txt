Known issue with IBM. They acknowledged it in their high end SCSI
drives, but refuse to do so with the IDE and low end SCSI ones.

They had a cleanroom contamination that resulted in random contamination
of the platters. They are hoping the casual user won't discover the
problems until the warranty is out, at least on average.

look up IBM 34 and 72Gb SCSI drives for servers, and recalls for more
info.

out in his RAID arrays the last year or so. <Grrrr>
