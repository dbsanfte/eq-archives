As an uber-newbie killing bats in EFP, I was given a Sarnak Battle Axe. I
had it for like 20 levels. When I passed it to a Newbie, I said, "Take this
Brother and may it serve you well. The only condition is that when you get
something better, you have to promise to pass it down. And have that person
promise to pass it down as well." I like to think that 18 months later it is
still getting passed around.
