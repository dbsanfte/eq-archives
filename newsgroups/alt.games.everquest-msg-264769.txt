True, the technology used and the ease with which it was implemented are 
impressive and indeed good news. Supports what I've been saying about the 
agile development approach they appear to be using, that their 
infrastructure allows such massive late-innings changes with relative ease. 
It's the effect on gameplay that bothers me. I remember how thoroughly 
bummed out I was when I first learned that Atlas Park in CoH was instanced 
and anytime I went to the plaza to mingle with my server, a good half of my 
community was invisible to me. Same deal here, it's a loss. Let's hope it's 
a temporary thing and that when server populations are distributed at retail 
it won't be necessary.
