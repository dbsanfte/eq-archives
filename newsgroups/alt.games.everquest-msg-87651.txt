You are talking about yesterday late afternoon/early evening (Eastern U.S.
time) when they went down?  You had warning???  I was on TP, grouped at
Splitpaw and decided to run to the nearest town (lol) to sell and bank.  As
I was headed to NK to go wherever fate took me, I suddenly froze and that
was that.  I had to /q to exit the game.

Some warning would have been nice...  sigh...  Did I just miss the messages
or did they not say anything on TP about goin down?
