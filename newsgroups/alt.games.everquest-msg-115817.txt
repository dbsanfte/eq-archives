Actually, they do mention parent or guardian.  A parent or guardian cannot
share an account with anyone, including a minor child, they can set up an
account that they allow only the minor child to use.  You could come up with
some flimsy excuse, along the lines of divorced parents, joint custody, and
such.  They also do not detail what happens when the child is no longer a
minor.  Technically, at that point they need to get their own account, not
transfer the account they have been using into their name, unless I missed
something in glancing through the EULA.
