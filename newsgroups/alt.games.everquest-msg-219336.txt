Foxy,

I think it's a combination of three things.
1)  Echoes of the past.  Yes, rangers DID have a serious problem during
Kunark and Velious, and some people don't know how/when to let go.
2)  Newbs with PL'd rangers.  As a wizard, I roll my eyes at most of the
kids who started wizards during the big Manaburn boom when we were briefly
gods.  Now with EQ/AM3 being the 'big thing' for max damage, those wizards
are deleted (thank the gods) and recreated with bows in hand.  And doofus
can fearkite animals to level a ranger now (with their 60+ shaman alt on
/autofollow to keep heals and buffs going).  The result is as scary for you
as it was for me.
3)  Someone once said that hip humor was cruelty pretending to be funny.
The combination of 1) and 2) gives folk who take pleasure in dragging others
down plenty of ammo.  As we all learned on the playground in fifth grade, if
you keep crying when bullies call you names, the bullies will ALWAYS get
their kicks calling you names.  Unfortunately, 5th grade never ends in EQ,
so there will always be rangers getting inflamed over the nasty comments -
and thus there will always be arses with those comments at hand.

The fix?  Do your own thing, have fun with the game, and use the /ignore
list liberally for the worst of the lot.
