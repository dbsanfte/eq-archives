I'm going to preface this all by saying that you should play your enchanter
any way you'd like.  But if *I* were you....

- Rune - cost of 8g per cast.  If you were stunning and slowing, you really
shouldn't need this...and those spells are free.
- Obscure - AC buff...clerics get a better one.  They rarely cast it on me,
though, so I'll toss it on myself. Ultravision - if they don't NEED to see
better, don't bother casting. Clarity & GoM are fine
- Augmentation (mentioned in the snipped part)  Also cast that on all group
members who you can't talk out of Alacrity...even more AC.
- Strip Enchantment...you have this up most of the time?  Not much point
unless you're always fighting casters.  Don't need it for the occasional
one.
- Tash, good if there's going to be magic-based casters.  Doesn't help at
all for fire/ice spells.  I've dumped the spell a number of times when the
critters are fairly low MR anyway.
- Tepid Deeds, great spell if no shaman in the group.  If so, dump it.
- Mem blur...you get good results from that spell?  I never have.  Mez's
built-in chance of blurring has always worked for me as often as the blur
line.  Long recast time, too...dump it and put up another stun.
- AE mez...dump it unless you expect trains.  At level 37 you should be able
to easily handle 3 critters + an add or two later, all with single-target
(which lasts a hell of a lot longer)
- Mez...goes without saying, this is a spell that should be memmed at all
times unless you're in a zone where nothing can be (Kael comes immediately
to mind).

To decrease damage without drawing much aggro, chain-cast two of your AE
stuns (can't remember if you have a 3rd yet) in zones where it's safe to do
so (most).  Don't Rune a cleric that's being beat on, mez the critter doing
the beating if it's not the tank's primary target or chain stun, or root it
and tell the cleric to move.

For a non-nuking enchanter like you who seems to be interested in crowd
control you're forgetting an extremely important tool.  One that I must
admit I didn't give much thought to until about level 54...root.  It's fast
becoming one of the 2 most important "always up" spells (along with mez)
that I use.

To summarize, dump rune unless you're rich and can afford to blow your cash
and mana away.  Useful in specific instances, but it's not an every-day
spell unless, well, you're rich.  It's not your job to keep tanks alive,
it's your job to take care of adds and keep the casters alive, and a
nuker/dotter that gains aggro of the main critter too often DESERVES to die.

Dump strip enchantment and AE mez, but have both spells handy.  Put your AE
stuns up instead, they're cheap, low aggro, and saves more lives than rune.

Dump your AC buff if a cleric is in the group, ask them to buff you instead.
Dump slow if a shaman is
Dump mem blur...root works better and recasts much faster
Got room for a spell, and mana to spend?  Put nuke up.  The recast time
almost guarantees you won't get aggro by over casting, but you should still
be careful.
