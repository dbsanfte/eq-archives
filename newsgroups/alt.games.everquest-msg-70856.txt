I wasn't burned by the change at all.  I already had several fungi tunics
scattered around so didn't need to get one if I wanted to use it to twink
with.  I just found the change to be short-sighted, obviously intended to
slow down the first-levellers, and just as obviously destined to have
absolutely zero impact on the true first-levellers with a druid pet in tow.

And according to game mechanics, cats and particularly beastlords should be
able to use the fungi.  So not only is it short-sighted, it's also contrary
to the in-game "way things work."  That makes the intent all the more
obvious.  Yes, this is a "nerf".
