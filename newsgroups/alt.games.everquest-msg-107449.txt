Keep trying. You typed something wrong. I believe I just said "I wish to
register to trade" and off he went.  Make sure you have him targeted in
the target window when you answer, and that you're not defaulting to
group chat, or guild or whatever. Lot's of stupid ways that you can mess
up and quest mobs won't answer you.

One of our wizards finally got her AC ring this week and went to visit
Hastrum out in Rathe Mtns.  In guild chat, we see,
"What boots?"
"what boots"
"boots"
"GIVE ME THE GOD DAMNED BOOTS YOU SHORT ARSED BASTARD!"


You tell the guild, 'Um, Synvar? You're in guild chat.'

"Oh, #*$(YU#### me"
