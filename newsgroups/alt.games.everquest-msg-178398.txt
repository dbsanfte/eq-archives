Bullshit.  Let's go back and quote Ed Jensen, shall we?

/quote Ed Jensen
As long as you keep subscribing *in spite of* the huge and glaring
bugs, you're as much as saying, "These bugs are acceptable."
/quote

That is not particularly close to what you're claiming to have said
in this post.  And it is, in fact, an attempt "to put bogus words
into the mouths of hundreds of thousands of people".

Correct.  The fact that you did it, illustrated above where I quote
your first post to this sub-thread, is what makes it true.

Oh very good, another line of bull about conveniently snipped text.
Here, let's pull out the ol' quote machine again, this time we'll
quote kaev's response to what you said in the earlier quote:

/quote kaev
Really?  You don't think there's a rather substantial difference between
"I enjoy playing the game, but the bugs that came with this patch suck"
and "These bugs are acceptable"?
/quote

Now, please explain how that puts words in your mouth?  How is it that
contrasting a paraphrase of what the typical EQer <is> saying with the
bullshit that bitter ex-EQer Ed Jensen wants to put in their mouths
is putting words into your mouth Ed?  The answer, of course, is that
it is not putting words in your mouth.  Instead it's an example of a
common, simple rhetorical device, used here to highlight your troll for
what it was.  Your lame response, the absurd claim that I was trying to
put words in your mouth, simply makes something obvious, that you are a
bitter ex-EQer trolling this newsgroup, blindingly obvious.

Careful there Ed, don't drown yourself yawning underwater like that.

Really?  You sure fooled me, what with this bitter and pathetic
trolling of the EQ newsgroup months after you announced you were
quitting.  You're oh-for-three here Ed.  You've struck out.
