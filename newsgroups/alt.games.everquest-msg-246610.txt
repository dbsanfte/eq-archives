I don't remember much bitching about LDoN at all.
Other than the typical whining that goes on about any
new expansion about not fixing existing balance and bugs
and releasing new content.

I would have paid 30 bucks just for the in game map and
larger bank from LoY alone. Granted you could argue that these features
should have been in from the get-go or added for free but big
whoop. They are a company that needs to make money.

I adventure quit a bit in LoY. Loot is good for those levels and
its easy hunting.

Only thing I use from GoD are the tribute and leadership abilities.
