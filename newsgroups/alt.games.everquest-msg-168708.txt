    The cleric is smoking crack. DArb has no associated aggro. I can say
this and feel confident given the mobs we've faced where it has been used
right off the bat, and the cleric using it has NOT gone on Rampage until he
casts a normal heal. (Against stuff that quads for 3500, the rampage list is
pretty freaking obvious.) Perhaps your cleric friend is following up DArb
with a heal that's massive aggro due to size/timing?

    James
