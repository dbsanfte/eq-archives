*nod* Most people don't know, and I get the impression that those who
are told they get 20/20 flaunt it like that's something spectacular.

Some places have tests to see if a person is fit to drive. I think
you'd fail one of those, with your current correction.

How odd. And yes, when you're slightly off, your eyes will strain
whether it'll accomplish anything or not (it won't).

Heh, I'd love to :) (funny thing is, British optometrists are supposed
to be good. If they can't give you glasses that'll let you read road
signs, they should at least figure out why, and tell you...)
