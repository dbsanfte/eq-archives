My point exactly. We're usually just up there 3-6 ppl., so Maestro isn't
really an issue. :)
So, if anyone have SEEN the Tome drop off a mini-boss, feel free to share
which boss, etc.
I hear rumours of it dropping off Archon G'Uvin in Tier 4. Confirm?
And has anyone seen it drop off mini-bosses in Tier 1-3?
