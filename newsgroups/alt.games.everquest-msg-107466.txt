Snicker. just like everyone else I love clerics for their ability to save my
butt several hours of lost time due to unforseen death creping up on me:)

What I really despise is all of those extremely competent clerics I love
being regarded by the great unwashed mass as oh hes just another cleric. The
cost in respect hits them all not just the misfits who couldnt play anything
else. For the same reason I really despised the great explosion in druid
numbers, it was based on the lie that druids where somehow the special well
loved easy class , and the only consolation is that every one who started
one for that reason is going to one day be pounding head against the wall if
they have not done so already.

I really like to argue the right side against a common misperception of the
facts. Since the chance to argue anything meaningfull here is so rare I do
tend to perhaps overdue it when a chance presents itself. I could and do
argue against many leaftist philosophies based on lies but here does not
seem the proper place to do that :p If however you wish a change in venue to
social security, the less fortunate, drug laws , taxation , or any of a
number of related issues I could certainly oblige:)
