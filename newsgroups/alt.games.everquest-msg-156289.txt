I was in a Lcea Katta raid today, my first, and it was a
different sort of battle.

The mob is a bard, it seems, although if thats true she sucks as
one.  Seems to sing only one song, but its a doozy, an
unresistable charm... and she cheats, or so it seemed, having
multiple pets at any one time.

Her charm was also apparantly unresistable, at any rate people
with 250+  MR reported zero resist messages.

This made her very annoying to work as a healer, since any time
I'd start a  CHeal there was a good chance my target would be
charmed before it would go off.  Result, I'd spend the mana, but
no heal.

First fight went along all right for a while, although people
kept dying... and I was kept busy rezing them on the spot, in a
sort of slow motion zerg.  Lots
of HP on Lcea there!  Eventually, though, the number of people
dying kept going up and things went downhill.  I got aggro, got
beat almost to death, then got charmed.  I was meleeing people
with my rez stick, that was amusing.  But then I saw myself
casting CHeal and was getting pretty steamed, although in
retrospect the nerf would mean a mere 7500 heal for her... at any
rate, shortly thereafter I finally got past charm and discovered
my CHeal target had been myself!

Well by now it was clear things weren't going to work out, I
rezed a few more people before she came for me again, but didn't
manage to get enough up and running for us to win...we'd got her
to 12 %.

We rezed up, buffed up, and by the time we were ready she was
back to full.  This time we had had time to discuss things, and
it went much better.  We had exactly one death, and that because
the charmed person somehow wandered well out of heal range before
breaking charm, then ended up fighting some unrelated mob that he
was KOS to, on almost no HP, and dying before we could figure out
which way to send a healer.  Next time send a druid, would be the
plan.

What did we do differently?  Well, we took off our MR gear, in
some cases that meant substantial upgrade in gear (sure did in
mine)  We cast no DS; seemed that you'd get treated pretty much
like I did, get aggro, get beat way down, then get charmed.
First time thru, people killed themselves fighting other people
while charmed by hitting the DS!  We also made sure not to pin
her, seems whenever we did that she charmed more than ever... not
sure why this would be, since bards are perfectly capable of
singing while moving.  But the main thing is, we made a no pets
rule.

It seems that she'd charm a pet, who would then never revert to
the owner's control.  Unlike the warriors we were losing right
and left, the pets would retain all DPS, and would stay on the
other side till death did them part, while the warriors were back
on our team in under a minute.  So our team was gradually
hemoraging DPS and her side was gradually building up more DPS!
In the end, this turned into a race that we lost.  Going no pets
meant losing that initial damage output, but it meant in the long
run not having to face it back in our faces!
