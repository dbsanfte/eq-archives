The message means exactly that. There is no functioning 3D hardware in
your computer that the EQ program can detect. This is not a directx9
problem nor a driver problem (I think). It has something to do with
your card and how it is functioning.

It might be that a chip that supplies 3D capabilities is not working
or that the 3D accelerator isn't responding.

I was playing with a Geforce2 MX200 and later a Geforce4 MX440SE (all
PCI, no AGP slot) and occasionally I'd get kicked out of EQ and when I
tried restarting the game I would get that messsage. The non-3D screen
worked fine else I'd not be able to see the error message. For me a
reboot (I always went with a cold boot) was necessary to solve that
and restore function. I attribute most of my problems to heat though I
doubt that is the cause of your problems. but it won't hurt to check
-- unsolved heat problems can cause chip damage.

Best bet might be to try and play another 3D game and see if IT can
run. If it does then maybe the EQ execute or DLL files are hosed. If
not, then you might move the card to another computer and see if it
works there (or remove and reinstall to make sure you get good
contacts).

If it can't work at all in any 3D game, then it probably needs to be
replaced.

Hope this helps.
