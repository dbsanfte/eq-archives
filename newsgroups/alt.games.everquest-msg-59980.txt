Where did I say anything different?   The best heal a cleric has at almost
all levels won't draw agro *if* the tank was at full health when the mob
was first engaged.   That means that the ideal situation is to never let
the tank pull at anything below full health.   The realistic compromise is
to try to not let him pull at a spot where a heal would not have any HPs
wasted.   (For example, healing for 250 when he's down 125.   In that
case, you should let him pull.   If he's down 300, why not heal that 250
and let him go out 50 down?)

That rule holds true for all levels.  The only real difference is that
Complete
Healing *always* has wasted HPs, and the object there is to let him get as
low as possible while the likelihood of being forced to heal too early isn't
too high.   At some point, he'll pull where you'd be forced to heal before
he
has sufficient agro, and the CHeal should be cast before he goes to pull.
