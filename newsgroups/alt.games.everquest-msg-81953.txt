Sorry I couldn't help you with it... I saw a druid in Treeform a few nights
ago, but he didn't move either, so it's possible, I suppose, that it might
be your system, but as everyone here knows, I ain't no computer whiz, so I'd
be guessing at best. Just thought I'd let you know that MY druid doesn't
move :)
