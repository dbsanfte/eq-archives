I started a monk so I could solo, as I have the Unholy Pager of Foo as well 
as the Tenebrous Cell Phone of Bar.

The Unholy Nerf and the ensuing nastiness destroyed the class. I have 
spent, literally, hours LFG at 55. Why? Well, let's see.

AC is meaningless on a monk these days. *Rangers* tank better now. 
Additionally, Luclin and later mobs hit so hard (being designed for CHeal, 
after all) that soloing is impossible for all but the most-twinked monk.

Pallys can Pacify mobs to pull them with ease, while FD splitting is 
cumbersome. Hell, Clerics can even pull in the average exp group. You'd 
think they would have learned their lesson by now, after nerfing Harmony.

Wizard Mana regen was increased with the advent of the familiar. Focus 
items increased all nukers DPS by increasing mana regen or damage output. 
What do Monks get? Maybe easily obtainable stacks-with-other-hastes Haste 
items? Easier weapons to get? None of the above. Monks got dick.

And what were the three big niches monks fell into? Oh yeah, it was 
pulling, DPS, and tanking.

I like to call this Enforced Buddhism.

Add to this the fact that, if you ever want this to change, you *must* buy 
or earn WR bags, which fetch a pretty penny.

The problem is this: By "soloing" do you mean you want to take down a mob 
with 6 minutes of downtime after?

...except for the newer zones where mobs almost never forget you.

This used to be a valid way to do it. Now, it falls apart around "Just live 
long enough to kill one".

I just stripped my Monk to finance my Cleric. I am having fun with this 
game again, not running around for an hour spamming my services zone to 
zone.
