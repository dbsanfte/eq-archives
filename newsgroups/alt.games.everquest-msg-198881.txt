At level 57 I'm still happily using charm, and don't see any reason why I'd have
to stop by 60.  Over 60, with the rapid greening as currently implemented, yes,
I can see where killing 55ish mobs would start to really suck, but not before
then.

If you move around a lot, I'd get run run run, and soon.  My bard waited till 57
and I'm sooo sorry, I didn't realize what a pain it was clicking those TBoots
every few minutes until I no longer had to.  Plus TBoots, unlike songs, requires
stopping song by clicking on a song and then clicking on boots, which is a pain
compared to simply doubleclicking a song to start and stop it.  Plus there's a
hotkey slot for the TBoots and an inventory slot for the TBoots since getting
them out of a bag to use would be even more annoying.

Mind you I think TBoots are the single best purchase (well JBoots better but I
didn't get them) a bard can make under 50.

But Run 3 means never having to worry about outrunning mobs ever again, no
needing to keep up a buff, no song slot, no inventory slot, you are just
-always- faster.  (even with run 1 you are always faster, but run 2 makes kiting
possible and run 3 makes it as smooth as TBoots ever did)

I'm interested in the speed song you are talking about, but only in the way I'm
interested in a new ferarri; I do love speed, but day in and day out, its of
very little real use.  Faster than mobs is all you need, and TBoots lasted
longer than selos or even 49 selos, so I used them.  Run 3 lasts forever,
indoors or out... I use Selos to cross zones fast and thats it.
