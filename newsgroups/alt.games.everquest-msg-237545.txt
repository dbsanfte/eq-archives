From a 'God's' point of view, I'd say it'd be rather arrogant of me
(the God) to consider something that *could* just be the consequence
of random chemical and biochemical reactions over billions of years as
absolute proof sufficient to demand that any sentient beings see an
act of creative will in it, much less that of one specific 'God'.

I am of the opinion that faith should never require proof, that there
is a god and that at the heart of it all, all religions really worship
the same thing. And I don't have a shred of tangible proof.
