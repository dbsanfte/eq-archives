First, NPC's do not thank someone for a plat diamond ring.  They may say
thanks but they dont mention for what.

The fact is that when these things are put up for sale it takes hours to
sell them.  No on even bothers making offers.  Should I give these things
away because no one wants them enough to make an offer?  If I did they would
just sell them anyway.
