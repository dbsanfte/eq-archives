Well it was rare, like Malo and Pox.

It was decent, it had some big limitations though....
1) Group only (well look at those negative effects)
2) Can't use it on a tank in battle
3) The snare and slow are pretty harsh (it pisses people off, you can't
chase running mobs)
4) It takes mana from the caster

Despite all that though, it was a very powerful heal, when the only
alternative was a poxy 400 or something slow casting heal.

The incomplete heal made it less vital (lesser efficient versus horrific
effects), the PoP spells further reduced its usefulness.   Quies makes it
even less important (you will never use torpor once you have it) - but I
just paid 125kpp for that spell... so its not something you'll commonly see
sold yet
