I can click and hit escape on seven corpses before you can loot a single
item and click destroy and then yes on the confirmation box.  I'd imagine
anyone can.  :)

Yeah, but I *never* turn off the destroy confirmation.  I've seen "destroy
this a fungus scaled tunic?" and "destroy this Journeyman's Boots?" pop up
a few too many times as I try to stick stuff in bags and run (and chat, and
play gems, etc.) at the same time.

I don't go to Rathe Mtns often enough to make that run an issue really. 
Besides, the run only takes about 5 minutes, if that.

After I posted that, I was thinking...  "two a minute?  That's me being
lazy."  Though it probably does average out to that as I spend a bit of time
clearing out placeholders and simply running to within range for my pet to
go attack.

Yeah, especially with the focus available, stick with the fire pet.  I used
49 fire pet until I got epic, and generally *still* use epic even at 65
purely because of the fireshield that I still can't beat.  Three at once is
when a fire pet shines.  :)
