Hehe :) Luckily for my dark elf (who can't resize armor the way my
wood elf warrior could), the darkforge is reasonably light, and she
has no use for the int on the heavier sentient armor. I need to find
her a darkforge bracer to make her arms look pretty, though...

I know crustacean armor is supposed to be all that, but I really hate
the way it looks.

My warrior was my original alt, but my shadow knight is my secondary,
and she'll be the one to do all the dungeon exploring that'd kill my
druid (invis, iu and feign death - can't really beat that!) My sk has
gotten quite a few decent weapons as gifts, too. I twink her with food
and teach her to cook, learn where to find vendors that like her so
she can sell junk, and her permanent necro partner also has a druid as
his main, so when we want to move far, each of us ports the other :)
