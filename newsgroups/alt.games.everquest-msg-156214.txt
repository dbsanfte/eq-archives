Yes, therefore you might turn down a rez if you have "fabulous buffage",
rather than because you aren't dead.

There are, at low levels, buffs you can recieve that are certainly worth
more exp to you than you'd loose dry looting, and of course you might
even have a 96% rez arranged for a couple hours from now, when your
buffs have worn off and you are running out of time on that body.
