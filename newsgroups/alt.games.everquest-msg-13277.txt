   I'm wondering how many others have experienced this.  I've had trouble
convincing the Power That Be that this is a real bug.

   Since starting my main character, a Druid, back in February 2001 I have
three times died by a 10000-point fall....when standing still or medding on
flat ground.  Twice, my body was far, far away from where I was
standing/sitting in LOIO.  Early on, the first time, I fell right where I
was medding in BB.

   Last night, the death cost me my newly won level 29.

   It seems to be getting worse.  Day before yesterday, three times
(once in BB, twice in Kelethin) I was suddenly and without warning
relocated to another spot in the zone.  While shooting a bat for
a wing to levitate (guess why I have a sudden affection for the
levitate spell) poof one second I was in the newbie area, next
second I'm standing in front of the zone to lesser Faydark.  10
minutes later I'm medding up on the platform at the bank, and when
I stand up I'm on the zone line on the north.  Later, in BB, running
the zone -- BAM -- you have fallen for 436 points damage.  

   Kept levitate on continously after that all day and the next,
ran out of wings, and in LOIO in the middle of a fight to secure
my level 29 -- suddenly i'm in the sky, then "you have fallen
for 10000 points damage LOADING PLEASE WAIT".  My body was found
on the zone line to the north by a helpful bard, miles from where
I was standing during the fight.

   Have I petitioned?  Yes, the second death in LOIO two months
ago I petioned a GM, who helpfully located my corpse but would
not tell me where it was.  Did not believe, apparantly, that I
died as a result of a bug.  Found a bard to help me find it then,
miles from where I was standing still on flat ground.

   Last night, I did not bother.  Another player who helped me 
to find the corpse said this had happened to him four times
before (he's level 25).

   What is happening?  What causes it?  Is there anything I
can do to prevent it?  I will note it always happens when I 
am playing on dial-up, never when I am home and on cable modem.
I suspect that somehow a packet being sent server to client
giving a location update is being garbled and the garble is
not being detected by the client.

   Others have this problem????  Please help convince Verant
that THIS IS A REAL BUG.


   Thanks for listening,
          Dutch
