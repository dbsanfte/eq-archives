It's been a while for me but I think at 35  your mana pool may not be deep
enough to quad.  Try this:   Try quadding ONE  and see how the mana to HP ratio
is.  If you have  one - two bubble of mana left after quadding that single one,
 move on  to two then three, then four.

But I'll tell you, Quadding  was not mana efficient to me until I reached 44
and then in the 50's  Root - Rotting was the best way for me. Root - rot - med
etc etc.  When the MoB falls, pull the next and repeat  medding as necessary. 
But if you like that  adreline rush, and the spectre of add,  by all means
quad.  LOL.

Hunting grounds?  OT, FV  come to mind.

Best of luck.
