Translocate:Tox -- 225 mana, 10 second casting time
Tox Portal -- 300 mana, 16 second casting time
Tox Gate -- 150 mana, 7 second casting time
Gate: 70 mana, 5 second casting time
Translocate -- 200 mana, 8 second casting time

doesn't look there are any real advantages to casting the translocate spell
over the gate spell for that location for the wizard personally.
translocate tox IS cheaper manawise than the portal spell, but the advantage
to this spell, as I see it, is that I DON'T go with the person that I'm
teleporting.
