lol, you're the one with problems here. You try and twist it to this, and
you're not even a blizzard customer. So if that's your final argument, you
should never have even bothered joining in the discussion in the first
place.

In another post you go off about "isn't there a bit in the
license/contract".  There's an entire area of law for this domain, heh why
get into it?  You haven't even read the license, let alone know anything of
license law.

Go on I bet I can guess your next retort.  How about you surprise both me
and yourself by twaddling off to your coven and save the bitching about men
and how every word is an aspertion on you, regardless of how it's used, for
there?
