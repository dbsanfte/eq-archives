The only thing I could think of is having an outside program render 
images of the webpage then making your skin load the image in some 
window like the help window. I'm guessing it wouldn't work though, since 
the UI probably only reads the image once so you would have to /loadskin 
between every page. This is just me guessing though.

Also one would have to think of some way to communicate with the 
external program but that should be possible by reading the logs. You 
could make the logger watch for something like "You say: GETPAGE 
http://www.google.com" so you could command it by speaking. Would look 
silly when using it around other people though :). You wouldn't be able 
to click links either, you'd have to type them.
