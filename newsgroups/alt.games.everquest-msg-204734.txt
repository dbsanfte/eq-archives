Few answers in the other threads. One thing about aggro tho I have found
strange is as follows.

I go to HoH, charm a guard and use it to kill others. Tash Nuke do what I
want to the mob and the pet doesn't lose aggro. Add a partner, regardless of
class they too can launch all out against the mob and we don't lose aggro.
Add a third or fourth group member and the pet cannot hold aggro in the
slightest even if the new recruits do nothing against the mob.
