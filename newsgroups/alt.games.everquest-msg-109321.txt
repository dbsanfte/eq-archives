    I ran the Trade Commissioner quest at the same time as I did the
straight exchange quest between the alchemy vendor near the hidden passage
to Echo and the gnome in The Bazaar. The latter quest is very
straightforward - get package from alchemy vendor, give to gnome in Bazaar,
get package from gnome, give to alchemist in Shadow Haven, repeat. On the
branch of the Trade Commissioner quest where you hand off to the guy in the
Bazaar I'd deal with the gnome, and on my way to Fungus Grove for that part
of the Trade Commissioner quest I'd deal with the alchemy vendor (he's on
the way). You get faction with all four groups at both ends of the quest.
After an hour of doing both quests concurrently (I bound at the top of the
stairs near the Bazaar/Shadow Haven zone), I could deal with everyone in
town. I get a faction bonus with the shorties because I am short and stout,
and I shave some time off the Fungus Grove part of the run with Gate, but I
still think that after two hours tops you should be fine for faction there.
And you can always kill The Needlite Queen for a twink dagger, or The Great
Saphrophyte for Remove Curse if you get bored.
