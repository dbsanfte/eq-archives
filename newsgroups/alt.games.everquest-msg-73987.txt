I think that, in large part, many of the younger of us ("us" being the NG,
not me!) who play fantasy games such as EQ or DAoC (or even Gemstone, back
when it was just a text-based game that couldn't handle more than 40 people
online at a given time) are simply unaware that there was, in fact, a
"bible' of sorts for this genre. It's been a lot of years ago since I read
Tolkien's work, but I still remember my reaction... amazed, gratified,
wishful, enthralled. I sometimes wonder if this reaction is what's led me to
the position I find myself in now. Nothing seems to compare with that first,
enthralling read. EQ serves best, for me, though when Gemstone was hot, it
hit the mark (more or less) as well. I can only hope that things will get
better and brighter in the future. I, for one, will be re-reading these
novels -before- I see the movie. It's simply been too long, though
comparisons of book vs movie are usually a bad thing. Witness Stephen King
and the efforts of Hollywood. :(

Do read them. They will be worth your time and money, I promise you.

Thanks for playing.
