I *was* running my 27 dru /roleplay for several levels now, but I've found
that in wolf form (duh! it's gotta be a druid with a lastname like
Thunderfoot) I get PORT requests all the time now.  So instead of making
excuses why I can't give a SoW at that moment, I now have to explain that
I'm not appropriate level to port yet.  As you can imagine I then get alot
of 'whatever asshole' kind of responses.

So, I'm back to being non anon or rp.

*sigh*
