I'd say that this one off incident in LGuk was probably what started the
whole corpse/spawn crap in the first place but I doubt that it would happen

So, yes there might be some validity in this, in the same way as all those
players in DL used to believe that only a Warrior would do as their tank
because that's what they heard from the higher level players /sigh...That
one of the many things that bugged me about DL although it did mean if I
needed a group I could generally get one pretty fast there :ï¿½)
