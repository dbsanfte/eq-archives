2Kgs.16
[1] In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah Ahaz the son of =
Jotham king of Judah began to reign.

[2] Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned =
sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the =
sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.

I think this is refering to the U.S.(not refering directly, just a =
comparison) showing that we have fallen away from the Lord, if you read =
Chapter 17, it uses a different wording showing that they were really =
evil, wheras these people are only somewhat evil


[3] But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made his =
son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the =
heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.

I think this is refering to the U.S. as well(not refering directly, just =
a comparison) showing that we still generally act in deed what we do not =
feel in spirit, and you will notice that God doesn't destroy the society =
mentioned in this chapter and seems to bless it and protect it in fact =
as we will read on.


[4] And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on the =
hills, and under every green tree.

You can determine what this means if you read the surrounding chapters, =
don't think it is a good thing.=20


[5] Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel =
came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not =
overcome him.

This is supposed to represent the fact that this king fought against 2 =
countries at the same time and was not defeated. I think those two =
countries are Iraq and North Korea, I don't think God means for the US =
to accomplish any more than that before he comes back, and it doesn't =
seem like we need to defeat them, just keep them occupied and harrassed =
by the wording in that verse. Doesn't sound like that difficult a task =
to me. Just bomb the hell out of both countries, just keep them from =
growing their armies and nuclear capability, just harass them.


[6] At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and drave =
the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt there unto =
this day.

[7] So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria, saying, =
I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the hand of =
the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise =
up against me.

Might be call for help to Israel from the U.S.A. as America in many ways =
is Israel's servant and son.=20


[8] And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the =
LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and sent it for a =
present to the king of Assyria.

So I guess we give Israel something of value, money, weapons, etc.=20


[9] And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of Assyria =
went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of it =
captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.

Then Israel goes on the offensive and liberates a country, then fights =
Iraq and defeats them!


[10] And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-pileser king of =
Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to =
Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it, =
according to all the workmanship thereof.

Then the USA and Israel become all buddy buddy and rebuild the temple =
with full offerings and sacrifices which the antichrist later desecrates


[11] And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king =
Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king =
Ahaz came from Damascus.

[12] And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar: =
and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.

[13] and he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and poured =
his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, upon =
the altar.

[14] And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the LORD, =
from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the house of =
the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.

[15] And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the great =
altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat offering, =
and the king's burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with the burnt =
offering of all the people of the land, and their meat offering, and =
their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt =
offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the brasen altar shall =
be for me to inquire by.

[16] Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz =
commanded.

[17] And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the =
laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that =
were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones.

[18] And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house, =
and the king's entry without, turned he from the house of the LORD for =
the king of Assyria.

[19] Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written =
in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?

[20] And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in =
the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his stead.

So sayeth the Lord.=20
