Their number one priority for bug fixes has always been whatever
affects the high-end players, either in the form of broken content
(this is spotty, probably depends on how difficult they judge a fix
to be), or in the form of exploitable bugs that allow boss mobs to
be killed too easily and/or high-end items to be acquired too easily
and/or substantial amounts of platinum to be acquired too rapidly
("too easily" and "too rapidly" are, of course, defined by SOE,
often semmingly on an ad hoc basis).  For example, tradeskills were
mostly ignored for a long time, but after they added some tradeskill
rewards that were interesting to the high-end players a lot of other
stuff about tradeskills started getting more attention.  The group
buff bug had very little affect on the high-end players, KEI, Aego,
and etc. just didn't have as large an impact on heavily twinked
characters, and even less on actively PL'd characters.  As exploiting
the bug didn't have much impact on the part of the player base most
closely monitored by SOE, they had little incentive to fix it.

But, but, what purpose could a.g.e. possibly serve if nobody's arguing
about KEI?  ;)
