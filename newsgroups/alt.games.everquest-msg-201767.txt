Yes, its different, but that wont stop you enjoying it - Im an FPS nut as
well as an EQ nut....the milieu might not float your boat but you might
want to take a look at World War II Online as well....

For EQ sure fistfuls....here are a few

www.eqatlas.com - Maps maps and more maps - if you want to navigate then
spend some time looking round this site. You do now get the mapping
utility in newbie areas but for the non start zones you'd have to buy
Legacy of Ykesha (another expansion) for the full facility.

eq.crgaming.com - Good breakdown on the classes and skills here. A host
of other information linked off the site as well. Basic info for starting
up to long term strategy. Complete spell lists too and what the spell
does.

www.allakhazam.com - Invaluable to me as a source of quest lists for
zones, the bestiary is handy as well and my first point of call if I loot
something and go 'what the heck is this......'

www.eqtraders.com - At some stage you may want to get into tradeskills. At
that point this is the one stop resource for tradeskills. For a number of
the skills (eg tailoring, possibly smithing, possibly fletching and maybe
brewing dependant on your class) some of those skills may be handy early
on for the very basics like patchwork armour, tidying up rusty weapons,
low end bows etc)
