Actually - the fact that pet's remember their size across zones isn't
a bug - it's intended.  It's to allow pets to stay shrunk when zoning.

What was unforseen was a mage casting MS in a zone with giants (like
oasis) until the got a giant, then zoning and it kept the giant size.

This is fixed on test now.
