The dragon version of Ragefire despawns approximately one-half
hour after losing aggro.  That's to keep it from wiping out XP
groups (or people) who chance upon it.  A half-hour is more than
enough time for a raid with any hope of killing it to rez, re-buff,
and try again.  And, since it would be aggro'd by doing so, they'd
get another half-hour if they wiped again.  And so on and so on.

But it MUST be aggro'd within that half-hour or 'poof...'   One
"nice" way of doing that is to get a monk with a long-range
throwing weapon to aggro it and immediately feign.  That keeps
the timer going.

The human version will stand there until killed or zone reset.
