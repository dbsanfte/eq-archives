I wouldnt care at all if all eq2 posts were labelled as such.  This is
a.g.e, not a.g.e.2.

I like EQ, but EQ2 sucks (imo), and I dont wanna read about it, they are not
the same game, and bear little in resemblance to each other, aside from
name.

Its not like its hard to put eq2 in a title before posting an offtopic post
(and yes, it is offtopic).  To be fair lots of people do this, but around
the same number dont :)

A small peeve but meh, thats what usenet is for.
