Same thing could have been said about UO, with the killing of course.

Fact remains, when they lowered the entry difficulty level they picked up
another 50,000 subscriptions.

I said about the same thing when Diablo came out as "CRPG lite". You were in
the .rpg newsgroup at the time too IIRC. There were people asking some
pretty darn low level questions. Compared to anything else on the market at
the time, Diablo was a childs game. Blizzard sold 2 million copies.

That is where and what I think VI is doing with EQ. I don't think they will
get it right, but their goal is to get that ~vellium staff into the hands of
people other then friends of existing players.
