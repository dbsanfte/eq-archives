Closest server DOES NOT imply better connection rates or anything of the
sort. The trip your packets of data take to get to the servers has little to
do with where the servers are physically located. In actuality, they are
probably geographically close to each other (the same building or room
even).

Some servers (like the UK ones) are more than likely physically in the UK
somewhere, but could also just have better connections to UK users via
shorter hops to the server.
