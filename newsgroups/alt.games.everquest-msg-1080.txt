But charm works sorta and roots work well .Your pet is also still usefull at
this level. mem blur works well at this level. Get a snare friend preferably
with harmony and have a cheap easy field day almost anywhere outside.

frontier mountains is a particularly good outdoor zone for this . there are
many others :)

you should also consider exploring the easy dungeons . Sadly noone ever goes
into them at the appropriate level because tanks at this level are
incredibly dense . It will take them 20 or so more levels before rampant
stupitidity is knocked out of most of them.
