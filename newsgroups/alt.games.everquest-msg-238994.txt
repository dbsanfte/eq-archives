Just target what you want to cast on, bring up your inventory window, and
right-click on the item.  Note, some items must be equipped to work while
some items will work if they are in a primary inventory slot (i.e., not in a
bag or other container).  There are some custom UI's that keep equipment
and/or inventory slots always visible, so you wouldn't even need to open the
inventory window to use your clickies.
