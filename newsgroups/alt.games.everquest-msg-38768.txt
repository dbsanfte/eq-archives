I guess Dark Elves, that is my the race of my primary (actually my second
character, my first was a Human Monk that didn't work out and finally got
deleted at 20th)
I'd say they are one of the best looking races.

Can't say I have one.

Well my primary is a Dark Elf warrior but if I started from scratch it'd
prolly be an Iksar Warrior or SK.
For looks I think the Erud Paladins and SK's look the best.
