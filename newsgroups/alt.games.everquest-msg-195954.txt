You have hit the nail on the head there about no work or skill being
required. Casters get KEI and engage in a massive nuking action. As 2nd
melee/bard, by the time I twist in my 2nd song, most mobs are 99% dead.
Then we spend ages in downtime whilst they med up.

A good group uses all of its resources so that it maximise the
experience flow. Chr using KEI are not working to that theme.

I now twigged that a few mellees are getting revenge and pulling mobs
that they know they can handle as quickly as possible. This keeps the
casters mana low and ensures that they are more conservative, especially
after you leave a few mobs beat up on them.

If KEI is used effectively, then it is a nice tool, but it's adicts are
making it unwelcome.
