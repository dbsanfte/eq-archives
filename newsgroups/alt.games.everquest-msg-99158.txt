Reading the responses it sounds like there's lots of room for abuse...stuff
that they really couldn't have fully experienced on the test server.  No
doubt we'll see some modifying done.

I was going to say that perhaps Verant will come up with a persistent
Verant-based auction channel, but since that would undermine the Bazaar
coding hopefully they'll NOT create that channel, but this tradeskills chat
would be a good one.

The bad side of me kinda thinks that maybe Verant would WELCOME any excuse
to stick the Bazaar coding on a FAR back burner...it's been 3 months now, no
Bazaar, no new GUI, no ETA.
