Yes, it was a very serious exploit.

If someone left a corpse with equipment still on it and logged off, another 
person could create a level 1 character with the same name and then loot the 
corpse.  You needed to load some stuff into the EQ executable, and someone 
on the MacroQuest boards posted how you could use MQ to do that.  It wasn't 
specifically an MQ exploit - anyone with a debugger could do the same - but 
MQ made it easy.

I had several guildmates who lost everything to this exploit, and it took 
the GM's a couple of days to figure things out and restore their equipment. 
In the meantime, everyone in my guild was warned never to leave unlooted 
corpses before logging.

It's fixed now, glad to say.
