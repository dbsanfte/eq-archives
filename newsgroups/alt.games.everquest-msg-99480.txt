Ehh... you mean seven plus a DX kit? only 8 bank slots.

That's why you work up your tailoring and make hand made backpacks, nowadays
the only non-WR packs I've got are my coldain tanner kit and my shiny tin
bowl (keeping it until I use my hardened mixture so that I can make an extra
mixture for a friend, or my guild feels the need to do Jaeil for a few
rangers)  Although my bank has DX toolboxes, a DX sewing kit and a hand made
pack and a bearskin potion bag that I use for stuffing epic pieces in to
(since most of them are small or tiny).

Bearskin potion bags are easy to make, and you don't have to worry about
being extorted for HQ skins, and they're 10-slot and light weight, the only
downside is that they only hold small items.  They also have a rather
distinct look for a container as opposed to the normal backpack.

I used to use a Blackburrow Cask in my inventory. =P  sold it to some rogue
though, replaced it with a hand made pack.
