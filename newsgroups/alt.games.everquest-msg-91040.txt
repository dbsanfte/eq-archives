Sorry, but I 99% disagree (and I cant think of the 1% where I do agree
offhand - I am just being cautious!!).

I am sick of seeing the Sony/Variant/EULA screens - much better to
show the first two for less time (assuming it is not OK for them not
to show at all - that would be my pref) and only show the EULA if it
changes (or has not been seen before - recorded on server if the
legals get excited).

They currently flash up a screen after a patch - surely it is not
beyond the wit of man to show a 'servers going down' flash 3 days in
advance of any scheduled downtime. This would catch 99% of the
problem. 

Ideally the balance would be picked up by the patch system routing to
a server which is up which just displays a message saying the server
went down at XX.XX GMT and is expected back at XX.XX. 

It is more complicated if you want to cater for some servers being
down while others are not - but in terms of the complexity of EQ, it
should be a piece of piss.

And before you say anything - I have done it - I developed an internet
solution for an multinational and I made sure I could post an
explanation message in advance or during problems within 5 mins which
anyone trying to use the service would see. If I thought it important
enough to do 5 years ago, then with the increasing reliance on the
internet it should be done now - especially for something as
commercially important as EQ.The current offering is shoddy.

Cheers.
