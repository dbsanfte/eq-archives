Because like the monk and rogue epics, you will not only start as
soon as you ding 51, but you will be done before you ding 52!

Whereas a cleric could start his epic at 29 and not be finished
before hitting 60, even without powerleveling or twinking.... oh
and he legitimately -could- start it then, by the way, lord Berg
camp would be a decent one for a 30s group and a cleric can
always get away with being the low level in his group.
