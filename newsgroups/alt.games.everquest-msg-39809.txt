Last night I noticed that heavy spell effects (from a bard) would directly
correlate to increased packet loss on my lag-o-meter.  So, I upgraded to the
latest version of Detonator drivers for my GeForce 2 GTS (version 12.41),
figuring that might help.  Now I get extreme packet loss whenever I'm looking
at my spell book, or even if I just switch to windowed mode.  It's *very*
repeatable.  Go into spellbook, it'll be as much as 70% packet loss when I
come out, but will then be rock solid until I go back into my spellbook.  I'm
running Windows 2000 and have DX 8 installed (which I need for something
else).

Has anyone seen anything remotely like this, and do you know how to fix it?  I
think it may be related to the PCI steering that W2K does, and either my
mother board (VIA chipset with a P3/800) or the video card drivers.

Thanks for any info.  I haven't actually gone LD from looking at my spellbook
yet, but it's so bad I think I could.  It also makes memming/unmemming spells
really slow.  I may just go back to the 6.31 driveres I was using before, but
I think otherwise performance is actually better.
