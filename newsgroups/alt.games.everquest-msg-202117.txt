Must agree here. Silk Swatches / Spider Silks, Spiderling Silks and Leather
Padding are needed in LARGE quantities whenever someone decides to up a
tradeskill. The market for these things is huge and you can get pretty
decent cash if you farm long enough.
Especially the padding is very popular. Don't be scared when other traders
have like 200 for below average price. Those will be bought in an hour or
two and then the normal priced ones will be sold again.
