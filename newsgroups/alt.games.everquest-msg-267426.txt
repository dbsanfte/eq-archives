Becuase its scope isn't -that- limited. Arguing that its the EQ1 group 
implies that anything not eq1 related is OT. That simply has never been 
the case.

That line of reasoning could well suggest that the expansions Kunark 
onwards are out too. After all, anyone who didn't buy the expansions 
might not want to read about AAs, LXP, PoP flags, tribute, etc as they 
have nothing to do with someone who just owns 'Everquest'.

True enough, Kunark is part of EQ in a way EQ2 isn't... but then EQ2 -
is- a part of EQ; they share a world, history, and franchise.

Further, this group has historically considered all things 'everquest' 
on topic, from EQ to EQOA, to the version for the Palm. Hell even Lords 
of Everquest is on topic. We just don't see much traffic for them. And 
all of those are "NOT Everquest" too.

Its a bit late to claim that this the "EQ1" group, except, that by 
default, that's what usually is discussed here.
