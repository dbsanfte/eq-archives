Not sure, because I haven't had an AMD processor since a 450.  I bought AMD
over Intel because I "wanted to save a little $$" and with what I spent on
fans and psu unit I could easily have dropped in an Intel, which I've never
had problems with.
The "no thermal paste" bit was a new one on me.  I've always used it so I
threw some on.  I brought it to the dealer because I was trying to tell them
the processor was screwed.  It was running about 190F.  They pulled that
crap off and it still ran at like 170F.  I moved all the components away
from the processor and added 2 case fans.  It ran 150-155.  I now run
without the case and it's about 140-150F.  That seems to be about the best I
can get it to.  Played with just about every BIOS setting there is and no
joy.
How hot does yours run?
