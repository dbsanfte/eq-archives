I've been playing since Kunark release using a 26.4k to 28.8k dialup
connection and haven't had much trouble at all.  Course the patches take
longer to download, but when I patched SoL it only took about 70min.  My
brother had the same problem you describe (30+ hr download indicator).
He made sure he didn't have any .gz files or 0 byte files in his EQ
folder and downloaded the patcher off the Everquest website to replace
the one he had in his EQ directory.  Once he did that he got his
download time for patching down to 40min.  Don't know if it was a
solution or coincidence, but it did work.  Might try it if you haven't
already.
