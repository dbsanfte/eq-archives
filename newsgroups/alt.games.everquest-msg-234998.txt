PC is known for having a large crowd of very diverse, selfish, idiotic players.

Here's what I do:  "/OOC woops very sorry.  We'll move down and kill the ptargs
until you get done powerleveling your friend.  Sorry that we were playing here
when you showed up :) "
Then we move.  Oh, and I would add all of these people to my *no buff / no rez*
list, especially the higher levels, and I would send an email to their guild
leader.
I have found that the worst thing you can do is stand around arguing with PC
players.  You just end up ruining your own day.
