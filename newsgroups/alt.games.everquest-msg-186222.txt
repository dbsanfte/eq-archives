That was tanking before he even took office.

What allies? All the countries who were turning against us anyway long
before this happened? The EU and Russia have been denying our products
and food shipments for years.. they aren't exactly *best buddies* of
the USA and haven't been for a while.

>recruits for Al-Quaeda?  

Oh.. you mean like the thousands of *military* people from the Iraqui
army that surrendered to the MEDIA during Desert Storm?

>The neglect of the war on terror for the war
>of error?  

WHat neglect of the *war on terror*? Two of Bin Ladens kids were shot
and injured the other night and have been captured.. the guy believed
to have actually materminded the attacks on the WTC is now in
custody.. exactly how has the *war on terror* been neglected?

>What exactly is the brilliant move he made that got your 
>admiration?

Lets see.. he has more morals than Herr Klinton and his bonehead buddy
Gore. 

Over 12 years ago.. Hussein agreed to the terms set down by NATO..
that being he would be allowed to stay in power under certain
conditions.. of which he was either refused to meet, or outright says
he wont.. first he says he has no weapons.. then we see him destroying
those same weapons he claims not to have.

Are you really willing to be one of those who sits back and waits for
him to build up enough arms to to damage?

If you have a rabid animal on your property.. are you willing to wait
until it bites your sprog before you call the police, animal control
or go for your gun to shoot it?

If you have a rapist in your neighborhood, are you going to wait until
YOUR wife or daughter is raped before you decide to help find him?

Get your head out of your tv and start looking at the futue instead of
what you want for dinner and take a look around you.. until such time
as you decided to LOOK and SEE what is happening in the world and look
and see what has happened in the past, you will continue to keep your
head in a whole and scream about how *we shouldn't do this*

Guess what.. we didn't start this.. but I damn sure hope the person we
have in office continues to have the balls to stand up against pansy
asses like you and do something about people who pose a direct threast
to the USA and its Allies.. even if those Allies are just as wimpy as
the others who are bitching.

Clinton had a chance to get Bin Laden.. and he didnt.. Clinton had a
chance to keep an eye on Saddam.. and he didn't... he was too busy
getting a blow job in the oval office to pay attention to what was
happening in Foreign Affairs.. and now his fuck up has to be fized.

Maybe if he had been doing his damn job, we wouldn't be in this
position to begin with.

Jake (who is NOT a Republican.. but damn sure doesn't want to two bit
power hungry moron to attack MY country and get away with it)
