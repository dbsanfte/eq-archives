Most do, or fall right back into it when confronted with someone
roleplaying. A few, however, don't and it's a shame. Usually you would run
across people roleplaying to some extent... some more than others. I happen
to love FV, although I do not play there as my main server. When I get
frustrated I bounce onto FV to just play EQ and have a ball really.

FV is not at all empty, as a matter of fact alot of the old habitats used
more often prior to the Luclin expansion are again in full swing on FV... as
far as twinking goes, you have to remember: In order to twink a new
character ya kinda gotta get one or more to a level capable of doing that.
Extend that logic a bit further and you find that the players on FV are
quite capable of playing a single character server, maybe even more so than
on one where there are multiple characters to play. I know I get myself
distracted quite often having fully 3 other full servers to choose from in
regards to characters available for me to play. FV is quite refreshing in
that aspect! When I play there I am totally committed to my character and if
there's not a camp available to me I don't just log and select a new
character to play. It's really quite enthralling.

> 3) Any tips from players on FV?

Just one really: Have fun and try not to WORK too hard on FV. Languages can
be a block for a character depending on where you choose to hunt. Most times
I choose a character type and then move out of their original area around
level 8, which I also did on FV... simply share languages as often as
possible and concentrate on it not being too big a hurdle and it will work
itself out. Other than that: hunt, quest and do whatever you do on any EQ
server. Roleplaying adds a spice that alot of people don't appreciate unless
they take part in it. FV is a good caseplan and example of just that.

Ah, one more thing: be prepared to PLAY EQ... it varies on FV a bit more
than most servers, but a character located there will most likely have to
bring him or herself into their own, especially at lower levels... but such
is the virtual life on EQ, eh?
