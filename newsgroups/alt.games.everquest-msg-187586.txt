I play on XP just fine. XP home grew out of the Win9X crowd- XP pro is a 
growth from the NT line. Windows has always had two products at a time- one 
for offices and one for homes.

2000 has confirmed sound bugs and stuff like that- I have played on it but 
IME it runs smoother on XP Home.

The only caveat is staying up to date- little bugs are inherent to MS OSes, 
and they need to be patched.
