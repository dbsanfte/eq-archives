You are basically always better off running an LCD display at it's native
resolution, preferably using a digital output from your video card.  If you
intend on using multiple resolutions on a regular basis, or even a single
resolution that is different from the LCDs native resolution, then there is
no question that you are better off using a decent CRT that supports all the
resolutions you want at a reasonable refresh rate.
