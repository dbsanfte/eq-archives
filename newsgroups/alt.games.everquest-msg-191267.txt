It was the first named mob (of 3) - there were screens full of fight spam,
inc messages, death messages, chatter, debuffs, etc etc, before anybody even
noticed the ring was ninjad.   And its not like we've ever had reason to
(even assume) we should /report a mob killshot.

Reporting loot (when you loot it) is pretty standard, if the zone crashes
etc its your only comeback to get it returned, but mob killshots?  How
fucking retarded is that.  I can't even begin to think of how many mobs drop
loot (that aren't even named mobs) and the number of times you are unable to
loot it within 1-2 mins

We killed AoW once....  Somebody /shouted some weird characters, and made 38
of our 40 person raid crash out of EQ.  He then proceeded to help himself to
our barb pants and mask.   GM's returned those, and he got his fingers
slapped for that.

Im pretty sure its logged (the chat), I'll find out the name and see if hes
a well known fucktard or what.
Im still stunned now, thinking back a week later, that a GM actually said
and did that.
