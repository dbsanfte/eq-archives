Yes, Sullon Zek is the latest server to open up, having just been open since
this past Wednesday afternoon.

Pretty exciting there, the first couple of days when rawhide armor, giant
snake fangs, and wolf skin cloaks were considered 'uber'...hehe.  People
auctioning off tarnished weapons and rat shaped rings, and desperate to get
ruined cat pelts for medium sized patchwork.

But for a first time player, I wouldn't recommend it.  It promises to be
quite brutal, especially for a player who is just learning the world around
them.
