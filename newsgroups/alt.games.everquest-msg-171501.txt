Since people were asking for my items, here they are:

EARS (2): Golden Ear Stud = +3 INT
NECK: Golden Star Amulet = +4 INT
HEAD: Servant's Cap = +2 AC, +3 WIS, +3 INT, Effect: Reagent Conservation II
(what is this?)
FACE: Blood Weave Veil = +4 AC, +2 STR, +1 WIS, +2 INT, +2 AGI
CHEST: Advisor Robe = +8 AC, +5 INT, +2 AGI, +20 MANA, +5 SV MAGIC
BACK: Kunzar Cloak = +7 AC, +2 WIS, +2 INT, +10 SV FIRE
ARMS: Small Cloth Sleeves = +2 AC
SHOULDERS: Embroidered Black Cape = +4 AC, +15 HP, +20 MANA (replaced small
cloth shoulderpads...currently & up to LV35, +20 MANA is about +3 INT...will
probably want to replace it by LV40-45 though since by then it will only be
+2.5 or +2 INT)  I think I spent about 20-40pp on it.
WRIST (2): Polished Bone Bracelet = +2 AC, +3 WIS, +3 INT, Effect:
Affliction Effeciency 1 (damage done?)
WAIST: Black Lace Sash = +2 AC, +2 DEX, +2 INT, +2 AGI
HANDS: ShadowBound Gloves = +6 AC, +3 STR, +3 DEX, +3 INT, +3 MANA (recently
replaced my small cloth gloves)
FINGER #1: Saphire Encrusted Silver Ring (GM event where I died three times)
= +3 AC, +3 INT, +30 MANA
FINGER #2: Moonstone Ring = +3 STR, +30 MANA, Effect: Extended Range II
(don't have to be as close to mob to hit with spell?)
LEGS: Cloth Pants = +3 AC
SHOES: Small Cloth Sandels = +2 AC
PRIMARY: Needlite Stinger (was helping someone do an item transfer, then he
realized he'd just hunted a lore item & all his characters already had one,
so sold it to me for 20pp, just a bit more than a merchant would have paid
him) = Piercing - Damage 24 - Delay 7, Disease DMG 2, +5 SV DISEASE, +5 SV
POISON
SECONDARY: Stein of Moggok = +5 DEX, +10 INT, +10 HP, +25 SV DISEASE
RANGE: Dagger of Mamek = Piercing - Delay 30 - Damage 3 - Range 40, +3 INT,
+15 MANA (think this was another one I bought for a bit less than most were
selling it for)

LV29 (4.2 bubbles into 29) Dark Elf Necro
