POV and COD are the only 2 zones that I can see any use for it.
The little rats in COD are actually pretty good, since you can give them 2 
swords and they dual wield.
Even enchanter dire charm is seldom used. The new animation is as good as 
most DC pets.
Only really good dc pets are in POAir, and they quad for almost 300 (and 
arnt animal)

Yes. Waste of time.
