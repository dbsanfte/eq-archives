I want a bumper sticker that says, "Keep Norrath clean - loot a corpse!"

The reason you see so many bodies lying around is that some folks are
uncaring of the loot at lower levels. Just loot everyone else's kills, if
they seem truly abandoned, and enjoy the money you make.

When I took a higher level character to the Warrens to hunt for faction, I
allowed everything there to rot. But if a newbie had come along, I would not
have objected to them scurrying off with backpacks full of loot.
