Try and stick with the point here:

1.  They provide numbers for practically *EVERY* aspect of the game.
Down to damage done and damage taken.  Even down to how long it takes
to cast a spell.  We're talking about 2 dozen seperate game aspects
here.  

2.  The two things that they do not bother giving numbers for are mana
pool and skill level.

3.  The arguement that giving numbers for those two other aspects of
the game would somehow remove the immersive aspect of the EQ world is
right up there with "no really, that quest is live and working as
intended".
