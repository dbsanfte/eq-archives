If there is some means of regaining hp quickly by zoning, and you use 
that to kill mobs, and a GM notices you doing that, particularly doing 
that repeatedly, you will get dinged for exploiting.  This has nothing to 
do with my feelings or anyone elses' on using such a method, just the way 
SOE handles things like this.

Yesterday I watched a cleric pull a mob to the CT zoneline, root the one 
he wanted, zone out, zone back in, kill the mob.  I suspect that SOE 
would consider that an exploit, don't honestly know.

Using the zone to escape a mob without dying is not an exploit in and as 
of itself.  Zoning in, and finding a mob near the zoneline alone, and 
killing it is also not an exploit.  Using that combination, particularly, 
if you are taking adavantage of some type of bug regarding hp 
regenerating would be considered an exploit by SOE.
