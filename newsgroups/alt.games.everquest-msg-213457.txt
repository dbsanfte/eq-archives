Hi,

Can anyone tell me if the invisibility necro spell Skin Of The Shadow is 
supposed to be fixed or random duration?  I was told it had a duration of at 
least 17.5 mins but it broke on me after about 45 secs while crossing the 
dreadlands (got hit by a drolvarg gnasher).

The Improved Invis To Undead spell has a fixed duration and it mentions it 
in the spell description, but there's no mention of the duration with SOTS.  
Just wondered if any necro who's used this spell can give me a definite yes 
or no to my question.

Thanks,

Steve
