Hotkeying has been quite the help on PLing my lower level toons with a 55
druid that I have access to.  One thing that's been really helpful is quick
kills is some sort of harm shield (thorn shield from the druid, for
example).  However, I've been unable to figure out something though.  At
what point can I have the druid nuke the NPC (to kill it) and still get
experience on the lower level toon?
