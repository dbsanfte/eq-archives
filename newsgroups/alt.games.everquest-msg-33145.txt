Looting: I've seen people discuss master-looting and then typing a 
command in later after selling stuff so that the take is evenly split.  
Do you have to 'empty your pockets' at the nearest bank before you do 
this, or will it ignore whatever cash you had on you to start with when 
you go to split?

Faction: I *think* I vaguely remember reading somewhere that faction 
could only go up or down by so many points.  So what I'm wondering is, 
when the faction note comes up "your faction could not possibly get any 
better/worse with..." does that mean it's frozen where it is no matter 
what you do, or does it mean you've hit sky high/rock bottom, faction 
wise?
