An event that involves killing something?  Yes, that is quite hard to
imagine.  Next, coming to a server near you -> Another GM event where
you have to kill something!

I've seen a few gm events and of the ones I've seen they've all been
like this.  Have they ever had any puzzle type quests or anything that
take a little logic to solve?  Those might be a little more interesting.
