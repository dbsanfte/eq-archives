My playing habits have changed. When I was single, I could play all I 
wanted. Now that I'm not, I can't.

LDoN allows me to play in 30 minute increments, plus the time required 
to get a group together. I feel like I can still stay involved in the 
game without checking out of reality for hours at a clip, which probably 
would not wash well with the significant other.

It's an excellent solution for me, and I'm enjoying the game again. LDoN 
is the way to go.
