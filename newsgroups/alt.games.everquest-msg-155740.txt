Typically, melees don't get anything terribly flashy with expansions
(Velious' /disc is the only nearly flashy thing pure melees have gotten.).
Only hybrids do, and hybrids usually just get the spells their parent class
is 'done with.'

So what do Rogues, Warriors, and Monks get with PoP? The same thing they do
every single expansion... better gear. Better damage/delay ratios on
weapons, better stats, and more items that dilute the utilities that other
classes suffer for. <cough>
