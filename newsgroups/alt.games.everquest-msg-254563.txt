I had the same question and found the answer tonight.  The question relates
to the invisible spells with variable duration.  (There are better ones with
set duration, self only.)  The family enchanter cast invisible on herself
and proceeded to the site of the evening combat.  The timer said about 15
minutes remaining on the buff.  Much sooner than 15 minutes came the message
that she was becoming visible.  So, in this case, the timer was inaccurate.
