    The actual interface in Dark Ages of Camelot is pretty painless. You
make tradeskill "hotkeys" which, when pressed, will search your inventory
for the required ingredients and make the attempt at the item. To compensate
for the speed at which someone can press the tradeskill hotkey, you are
forced to wait a short time every time you attempt a combine. This system
has limitations (no experimentation to find undiscovered recipes, for
example - every recipe you can make is listed when setting up the hotkey),
but it does have the "no RSI" factor going for it. If you've ever gotten
tailoring past 131, or done metal bit smithing, you know why people curse
the interface EQ has. Just the word "Kiola" makes my arm cramp.
