========================
Hello Folks,
If you are suffering from long zoning and load times this is something I
would like people who have more than 300MB of ram installed on their systems
to try.

Basically we are going to reduce the amount of virtual memory your computer
tries to use.
Go Start to Run and type in system.ini look for the [386enh] section and add
the line ConservativeSwapfileUsage=1 and then save your changes and close
the file.

If this does not help all you need to do is re-run system.ini and delete
that line.

Like I said this is an experiment there are a lot of issues we are looking
at here so I am not saying this is going to fix all or even any of you but
it is something to try until we have a more permanent solution.
