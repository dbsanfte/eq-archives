Then you're almost certainly wrong.  As a conservative estimate, I would
guess bandwith is probably up 30 or more percent per subscriber since
Luclin.   Why?...  /bazaar.

The effects of 400+ characters per server being left connected to the
server, afk, for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week are not negligible.   I don't
believe it was a coincidence that the first time they brushed close to100k
simultaneous users was just a few weeks after /bazaar finally went in.

IMO thats one of thier bigger screwups in the area of cost-cutting.   Had
they come up with a way to do offline selling instead of requiring the
character to remain logged in, they would have saved quite a bit.  And
probably made the players happier as well.
