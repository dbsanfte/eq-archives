When I get questions like this I have to think so hard it makes me wonder 
just why I DO play.  But I'll go against the natural tendency of British 
people to see the bad before the good and see what I come up with...  :o)


1:  It's freeform.  I can't stand linear games, and EQ's one of the least 
linear games you'll find.  That said, non-linear freeform gameplay is 
always an illusion produced by applying limitations in other ways.  For 
example in EQ you can't progress in the game except by fighting.  But in 
general terms it's far more freeform than most single-player games, and 
that's one of the reasons I keep coming back to it.

2:  It's social.  I work shifts and am generally a bit of a hermit when I'm 
on lates or nights.  And, for that matter, I've never been one for going 
out drinking and generally doing the things that 'normal' people tell me I 
should be doing.  But if I get home after a late shift and Britain's 
already going to bed in preparation for next morning's hangover, America's 
awake and playing EQ, so I talk to them instead.  :)

3:  It's an achievement.  For the same reason I like Lord of the Rings, I 
like EQ.  Somebody's sat down and put a hell of a lot of effort into 
designing a coherent gameworld, with history and geography, and so on.  It 
doesn't stand up to comparison with the one nature's designed outside my 
window, of course, but it's still fascinating to wander round the place and 
look at it.  I've always loved 'exploration' games.  I never really played 
through the plot of "Frontier: First Encounters" when that was released 
because I was too busy wandering from planet to planet looking at the 
view...


As for other MM... whatevers, well, I've never played one other than EQ so 
I can't offer any comparisons.  And I don't have the latest expansion so I 
can't tell you much about my views on that, either.  Except that since my 
one foray into SharVahl gave me a framerate of about two per second, and I 
can't afford to upgrade enough to cure THAT, I'm CERTAINLY not planning to 
buy a further expansion that probably wants twice that level of 
resources...!
