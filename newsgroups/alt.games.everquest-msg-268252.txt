I'm actually the near opposite of that person.  I tend to focus in on just one
or possibly 2 characters, and only play them... and 4 character slots is just
not enough for me.  I want more choices to play around and find what I want to
do.  2 factions, 24 classes, 9 tradeskills... only four characters.

The only thing I could possibly think of is that they want to sell second
accounts to people... but I have to believe they're driving away twice as many
people as extra accounts they're selling, if not more.
