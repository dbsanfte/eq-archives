I prefer the option of hearing the original version and maybe
understanding it as well. Many animated films get dubbed to Norwegian
here, but a lot of theaters also show a subtitled version. 
Scanning subtitles with half an eye doesn't make it more difficult to
pay attention to a movie, unless you're dyslexic, of course. In fact,
in some cases where the actors are mumbling, the subtitling makes it
easier to follow the dialogue even though I do understand what they're
saying.
I avoid dubbed films if I can, especially English->Norwegian dubs,
when I know there will be nuances I'll lose by watching the dubbed
version. If it's a language I don't understand, I still prefer
watching it in the original language and reading subtitles, if only to
hear the original actors and not get too many unsynchronized mouth
movements. I _did_ watch 'Princess Mononoke' dubbed, but next time I
watch it I'll be going with the subtitled version. (I've found it
easier for me to accept a dub to English with animated movies than for
regular movies, though. I'm having trouble imagining CTHD in English)
