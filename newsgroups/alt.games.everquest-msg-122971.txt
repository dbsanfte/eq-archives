So, if my culture says that words you deem profane are no more
offensive than any other word, how is your asking me to feel like I'm
doing something wrong by saying them any less selfish than my asking
you to mind your own business regarding my language? The only reason
the bluenoses get any kind of credibility in these discussions is
because one particular brand of neo-Puritanism has been long touted as
superior to other subcultures.
