 I've found that once I reached level 22 with my main character, most of the
loot I was bringing home to the nice merchants would only sell for a plat or
less, such as a gnoll hide belt. Giving this armor to a player who is at
least level 5 would be better than anything he could possibly kill or quest
for at his level. All the fine steel I'm getting from the gnolls sell for at
least 5.5 plat each and that is plenty to keep me in newer armor and spells.
It just seems a waste to sell those nice magic armor pieces for less than a
plat when I know most of the players I give them to will use them for the
next ten levels and possibly pass them on as well.
Everyone in the newbie gardens love split paws and preserved Split Paw eyes.
To sell them you get 9 cp but the thank you (most are even completely
spelled out, no tnks d00d crap) I get is invaluable. I started passing out
minor loot as an investment in future grouping possibilities. Because I have
a name that is recognized easily, When some of these young pup grow up and I
shout out for a  group, they remember me with a pleasant light.
