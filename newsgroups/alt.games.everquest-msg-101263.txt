I don't understand what you're asking here.

Getting the highest level pet isn't hard, just tedious.  Because
you have to re-cast your summon spell several times in a row.  It's
not hard to sit down and med and re-summon.  It's not difficult.
Just tedious.

FWIW, I don't bother doing that.  I live with whatever pet I
happen to get.

The motivation is obvious: the higher level pets are stronger.

: mage.

We're spiraling down into semantics.  I don't think it would
make the game easier, just less tedious.
