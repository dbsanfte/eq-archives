As the healer is usually the bottleneck, slowing the group down to
the rate at which his mana regenerates, the fastest way for the
group to get exp and loot is for the healer to sit whenever
possible.  In a fast kill group, looting could cut a healer's
mana regen rate literally in half.  FFA groups with a healer
looting his fair share are slow and ungainly because of this.

Symbol doesn't really cost much, but it is indeed polite to
at least offer to cover it.  Its a simple matter for a cleric to
look at how many he has on hand at the start of a group,
and subtract how many he has left when the group changes,
and thats how much money he should get before the
remaining loot is split.  If he happens to care... only clerics
who realistically should care are ones in the 44 to 50 range,
who are using peridot (cost 10pp or more each) and are still
at a relatively low income level.
