As others have noted, this sounds like the ZEM for Kurn's will
be completely insane.  I had assumed they picked the hot spots
with an eye toward getting people to visit places they don't
otherwise go, and I hadn't noticed Kurn's being all that
under-utilised, but whatever.

So when will they implement /autobash, /autokick, and so forth,
for the rest of us who are still playing whack-a-mole?

On login?  I thought they poofed 30 minutes after logout?  I know
I've logged out (or gone LD) and come back within 30 minutes and
the bags are still there.

I'm guessing they meant that the bags will stick around (but be
converted) at the point when they would normally go poof, but I
guess I'll just have to try it out to see.

WOOT!!  /falls over in (feigned) shock!  My skill's at the 200 cap;
I wonder how often it'll fail now.  (Unfortunately my logs don't
tell me how often I attempt FD, so I can't easily check my old
failure rate.  Maybe I'll add some sort of "self-tell" to the hotkey
so I can keep track better.)

Good; I tend to leave my client up for days at a time (switching
between my active characters and my bazaar mule), so I do get bitten
by resource leaks.  I've been having a lot of client crashes recently,
so I hope this helps against those.

Ha!  I'll bet it was actually if you had more than 2147483 plat, 6 gold,
4 silver, and 7 copper.  I.e., more than 2-to-the-31st-power copper.

I remember when I was playing (and analysing) Heroes of Might & Magic II,
and found that a stack of several thousand black dragons would flee from
a lone peasant, because the total strength of the dragons exceeded 2^31
and apparently got interpreted as a negative number.

These sound related.  I suspect one or both of them accounts for me
taking a 20k fall when I got stuck on the lip of the ledge trying to
jump out of some water.  I jiggled and ducked and whatnot until I
came loose and went THUD to the bottom of the water for 20k.

Another WOOT!!  The getting-out-of-water problem was making it a real drag
trying to train up my swimming.  Whenever I visit Cabilis I like to swim
most places, just for practice.  But I had to stop when they made it nearly
impossible to get out of the water except at ladders (and even those can be
finicky to get lined up on).

I admit it never struck me as "bad" that it took a while to scribe the
spells; it seems realistic that it should be a slow process.  But I do
see how it's not a real exciting way to spend your time, so making it
faster isn't a great loss.

Yup, and neither my gnome nor my halfling could enter the huts in
Misty Thicket, except by ducking.  Glad they've fixed that.

About time!  I long ago made a chart, sorted by title, so I could
look up titles I wasn't sure of.
