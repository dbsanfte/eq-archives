Not in the same extent that I'm talking about.  Sure, I'll agree with
you that the current action of setting up the Exchange after saying for
years that it hurts the integrity of the game reeks of both hypocrisy
and greed.

However, if they were to finally go after IGE after they set up the
Exchange, I view that on a level that dwarfs that hypocrisy and greed.

They don't give a shit about IGE's effect on the integrity of the game.
 They never went after them then.  They don't care about the people who
were regularly defrauded.  They didn't care about the rampant
violations of their EULA.  They never enforced it *then*.  But suddenly
now it becomes a problem and needs to be enforced?  And why?  Because
IGE's horning in on SOE's little closed market economy and they can't
possibly have that.

There are plenty of potential reasons why SOE hasn't gone after IGE
after all these years; mostly that enforcement wouldn't be effective.
But if they enforce it now, the reason why they hadn't before will
become clear.  And the fact is, that just demonstrates that they don't
view their players as any better than shit.  Shit with money.  Perhaps
they really do view their players like that, and always have, but I
contend that that's not certain yet.  It will become a certainty to me
if they intend to wipe out IGE after they implement the Exchange.

Perhaps you disagree, and that's fine.  I, on the other hand, would
still like to think that SOE has a modicum of regard and respect for
its customers.
