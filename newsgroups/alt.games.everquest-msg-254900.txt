Well, I don't have all that much plat on FV, not that I'd want any
plat on the test server either, but I can help you out if you do
decide to play on FV. I'll make you a full suit of banded (assuming
you pick a class that can use it) and I'm sure I can pick up a decent
weapon somewhere (Goranga Spiked Club, maybe).

It's not much, but that and some Shammy buffs should get you started
off well enough.

Not much, but willing to do it for free. Let me know.
