	Because you're smarter than the average bear.

	Most people are not.

	Someday, maybe.  But not today.

	You have an awareness that Bad Things(tm) can happen to you on
on a computer.  You are aware that the computer does not work like a
toaster oven, or a television, or a vacuum cleaner.  I suspect that
you were aware of this even when you first started fiddling with
computers 17 years ago.  I certainly was when I started fiddling with
computers 20 years ago.  I did not know the *specifics* of protecting
myself, but I knew that I needed to learn.

	Most people don't know they need to learn.  Most people think
email is just like regular mail, only it's over the computer.  Most
people think that "Netscape" equals "Internet" (or "MSIE" equals
"Internet").  Most people do not have the same semi-instinctive
understanding of what goes on inside a computer that you and I had
when we first started poking them long ago.

	It is *not* easy for the average user to understand these
things.  Again I point out that I speak from over four years of
experience in this regard.  This is what I do for a living, and I'm
telling you that most people have no clue about even the most
rudimentary aspects of computer security.


>They don't need to know anything about it - they just need to toss $40
>for the software at the local computer store. Many computers come with
>the anti-virus software already installed.

	Right.  Already installed.  Which means it will never register
on the end-user's radar except possibly as something that they see a
splash screen for when they turn on their computer.  If they think
about it at all, they'll think "This is all I need!" and they'll never
update it.

	Yes, I know...  On your planet, everybody reads every page of
every relevant instruction manual, and would know that they needed to
update the virus checker regularly in order to keep their security up
to date.  

	On my planet, they don't.  On my planet, I often hear the
phrase "But I've *got* a virus scanner!  It came with the computer!
How could I be infected with a virus?"  When I ask them how often they
update it, a common response is "What do you mean, 'update it?'"

	That's assuming they know they have one at all.  Or that they
*have* one at all.


>The threat of computer viruses and security breaches are one of the
>favorite bugbears of the media. The average user *does* know the
>threat exists, even if they don't believe it applies to them.

	I think you suffer from what I call the Great Player/Lousy
Coach syndrome.  If you've ever followed sports of any kind, one thing
you'll notice is that the best coaches were rarely the best players,
and the best players rarely make good coaches.  The reason why is
because the best players never had to work hard at being the best --
it just came naturally to them.

	I think you're one of those people that has a natural affinity
for computers.  I don't think you were ever scared of them.
Therefore, I don't think you understand just how utterly alien the
concept of computer viruses, worms, trojans, etc., are to the average
casual computer user.  It's something that's so foreign to their way
of thinking that they have a hard time imagining that they could ever
be a victim.  Viruses and such happen to large corporations, or to
those hacker kids.  They don't happen to the Ladies Auxilliary Bridge
Club.

	The virus/trojan/worm programmers understand this, though.  In
fact, the most common method of delivery for these kinds of programs
is via "cutsey" type programs, that feature animations of Santa Clause
or fireworks, etc.  The programmers know that Ma and Pa Kettle don't
consider themselves a valid target for viruses, and certainly a virus
could *never* come from something as *cute* as this *darling* little
movie that shows the Easter Bunny hopping around throwing eggs at
people.  And since this *adorable* little thing could *never* be the
source of a nasty ol' virus, why, we'll just send this movie to
everyone in our address book!  Won't they be *thrilled*?!?

	That's how viruses and such get distributed.  Cynical virus
programmers capitalizing on the naivete of Ma and Pa Kettle, who just
got their first computer for Christmas and are just tickled *pink* to
be able to send that "email" stuff to their kids.

	Actually, I personally don't think they've announced anything
of the sort.  I think their announcement suffers from poor phrasing,
and nothing else.
