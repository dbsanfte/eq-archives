Didn't get jumped as such. You were pulling! Or were you just walking
around away from the rest of your group admiring the landscape?

Fine. This, or run if you think you won't kill it or at least one of you
may die trying.

I detect sarcasm, yet this is exactly what you _should_ have done. It's
not like you have to take the on mob 3 game miles additional walk. Run
to keep the mob. You have sow, you can run circles round it. It's not
like you have to pull in the straight line.

No, it isn't how it works. You don't have to fight each fight to it's
full conclusion (when a corpse is produced). If you decide you aren't
winning running for zone is widely practised tactic. What you DO owe
others (if you have manners) is to issue 'train to zone' warning (you
may have heard some of those - now you know what they mean), and to zone
ASAP rather than waiting at the zone for mob to catch up with you
(curious if it still follows). There are likely to be people resting
(very often on low mana and HP) by the zone line and I'm sure they would
appreciate such warning and not having mob brought right to them by
someone who will then zone.

It's more of the case of not being able to provide what they want. Wait
another 15-20 levels then go back to Oasis with your shaman friend and
ask him how he likes it THEN.
Heartless? Be heartless. Since when do you need to be nice to be right?
I didn't know you find being called a newbie offensive. Well, tough.
That is what you are. I have been one once too, but I never trained
anyone, not even before PNP was introduced and training wasn't against
the rules (not ones set out by Verant, anyway). I didn't train anyone I
didn't like or anyone that trained be either.

>I train people on purpose and
>get them killed (all the time). 

Didn't say you trained them on purpose, but you did train them. You
could have pulled the mob you pulled (which was your responsibility) off
them with ease.
I am confident you did not intend or plan to train them, but enjoyed
every minute of 'weenies getting what they deserve'. Right?

Hopefully by the time you can do that you will grow up of training
people.
