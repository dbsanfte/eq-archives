I was looking into a vid card for the pc I am building, so I asked =
around about the same thing GeForce vs ATI and I got a couple different =
pieces of input.

"A really good site, with indifferent opinions =
http://www6.tomshardware.com/graphic/index.html
just do a search on the type of card you are looking for. They will give =
you the geek info and the lay terms too :) with lots of graphs =
representing how each card did, on what system, etc..."

"As for the Geforce 4... I just upgraded from my old GII, to a G4 ti =
4200 64 meg. I had some problems for it until I went and downloaded the =
newest XP drivers. Since then, it's been as smooth as silk."

"ATI cards aren't bad hardware-wise....their drivers are what kills =
them. ATI has a nasty reputation for putting out bad drivers for their =
products. This is (slowly mind you) changing now they are following =
Nvidia's trend of having a universal driverset. (ATI calls their =
Catalyst, Nvidia's is Detonator) As far as ATI goes I wouldn't touch any =
of their current products except the 9700 pro cards....unfortunately =
they are NOT cheap. As far as best bang for your buck, it is (and for a =
good long time to come methinks) going to be a Nvidia product. IMHO, =
Stay away from the MX cards. Nvidia tried a little underhanded marketing =
by selling the Geforce 4 MX line of cards which were simply Geforce 3 =
chips overclocked. (They did the same thing with he geforece 3 MX...just =
overclocked and repackaged geforce 2 chips...bleh) As mentioned above, =
the TI lines are what yer looking for. The Geforce 4 TI 4200 may not be =
the cheapest card out there atm, but it is definitely the best "bang for =
your buck" Links to the Tom's hardware articles that were also mentioned =
above are here:
www6.tomshardware.com/gra...index.html
www6.tomshardware.com/gra...index.html"

"I also have the GeForce 4Ti 4600 128M and let me just say it was MADE =
for EQ - i have all effects on to the max (except spell effects cuz they =
just piss me off), including during huge raids and i rarely get even the =
slightest lag. Hell - i can run around the bazaar at full framerate with =
full names on and clip plane maxd. It's just a great card, although i =
also run a P4 and 1gb Ram, but the vid card is sweet - no complaints and =
was immediately eq compatible with zero additional drivers/downloads."

As far my own choice, based on input from my collegues, I am going with =
the GeForce 4Ti 4600 128mb card based on the points quoted above.
