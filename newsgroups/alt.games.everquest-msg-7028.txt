Hi, someone told me to hunt these mobs because of great loot/XP.

But were they perhaps forgetting that Im a Dark Elf Necro.

I havent been there but I guess I can invis myself and bowl around the city,
but as soon as I attack something I will lose my invis.

Wouldn't the guards and merchants start attacking me?

TIA
