This has always made me wonder why Verant capped the maximum number of 
players in a group at 6. In large raids wouldn't it make more sense to 
allow more than 6 players to share the exp of a kill so that Cerics and 
other classes which aren't doing the damage get some exp too?

A feature which would allow the splitting of exp among multiple groups 
seems like it would be trivial to implement and very useful to players.
