Just my two cents:

I began playing EQ2 in beta and when the game went live I quickly lvl'd a 
Dirge to 50.  The game was fun but was VERY group oriented.  It seemed you 
need to do a quest just to take ten steps in a given direction. :)  I quit, 
having been disappointed at lack of content at high lvls (how dare they not 
have epic stuff ready three and a half weeks after launch! hehe)   Anyway I 
really got the bug again recently as is often the case and although I didn't 
look forward to all the access stuff I came back All I can really say now is 
that the game is now, IMO, shockingly solo friendly.  I am not a loner but 
decided to just go very slow this time around and enjoy the game.  I am now 
a 26 Inq. and have not grouped since taking down a quest mob on the noob 
island.  I also play on a role-play server which offers many opportunities 
and activities.  I echo what others have said here about exploring.  As a 
cleric I have no means of invising myself and pretty much have to rely on 
sprinting away from mobs I cannot handle..that being said I have been 
exploring places where the mobs are very much out of my reach, and have done 
so with minimal incident to this point.  If you are one who takes an 
interest in questing and exploring then I think you should give EQ2 a shot.
