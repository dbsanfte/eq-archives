HI All;

Myself and 3 other RL friends just started playing EQ in January.  We
quickly learned that you didn't get exp when grouped, if we were more than 5
levels apart.  As we progressed, due to various playing times, our levels
are now much farther apart.  It seems like a level 45 can group with a level
58 (not one of us) and both still get experience. But a level 25 and a level
46 doesn't get exp. We vary from level 25 to 46.  We can't figure out how
the level spread works. It just seems like the higher we go, the bigger the
spread gets that will still return exp to all party members.

My question: Is there a formula that we can use to determine level spread
and still get exp?

Thanks in advance for your time.
