That would be a bit of an asshole thing to do. If you don't like their 
policies, get it someplace else. There is no rule that says everyone 
should charge no more than *you* think is appropriate. 

If they run into enough of you who decline due to the expected donation, 
they may or may not change and may or may not get many people taking them 
up on it. Either way, it's all a matter of personal choice factoring into 
the law of supply and demand. The only party who could be in the wrong 
would be the one who expects the scales tilted in their favor.
