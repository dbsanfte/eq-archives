It's very little money.  Even jewelcraft only cost me about 5pp to get to 
21 skill.  Tailoring, it might cost you an hour to hunt up enough silk and 
ruined pelts, and maybe 2pp for patterns.

And you can save all those lovely, lovely training points for later in 
life when you decide you just -have- to learn Orcish, now. :)
