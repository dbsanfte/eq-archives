    I'd throw a paladin in here, too - I think PAL AC is comparable, and
stuns annoy mobs about as much as DoTs do. The only thing I think they have
against them in a head-to-head is the poor availability of droppable PAL
weapons of MoSS quality, and the inability to be a large race like a SK can
be. It would be interesting to see head-to-head comparisons between an
Erudite PAL and SK to see how each tanks.
