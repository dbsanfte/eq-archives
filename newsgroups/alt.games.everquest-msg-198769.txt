My personal choice was/is get run 1 immediately. Run 1 is a major life saver
at times - ESPECIALLY for a bard (who is used to going fast, and sometimes
forgets when indoors that they are screwed. hehe).

After that, I took the levels > all approach. Of course, since I spend so
much time just helping friends, I haven't leveled very fast until recently
(been more focused given a race to 60 with some friends), so I'm still just
58 and waiting before doing more AA's.

Currently, I'm planning on the next batch at 60. Given that I'm doing fairly
well at obtaining my 61 and 62 songs, I probably won't do all that many
before going to 62, but certainly Run3, Regen 3, and IM1 for sure.
