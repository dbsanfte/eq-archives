I think most of the people bitching about this change,are likely just
Powergamers.Who see this as a hurdle in thier goal of gettin that new
twink to 50 in 2 weeks or less.Thwy can't kite 4 mobs if the mob is
smart enought to either run away or cut the kiter off at the pass so
to speak =)

I think this option would be a great idea on all servers(with some
obvious rule changes needed on non-pvp's)

It adds a whole new slant on a game with some seriously poor AI.
