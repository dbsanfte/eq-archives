Lol yeah right.

I was on vacation so missed the mad exp frenzy (and great exp it seems, with
the patch/supposed nerf coming up), but the first 65 was a druid in KtF
(keepers of the faith), Vexthal and other assorted goodies, so as good gear
as is imaginable pretty much.

The second to 65 was a bard, again in the same guild.

I came back to find half my guild 65, and me 60 :(  Was hardly gone more
than a few days too /cry
