Well, since the amouth of combinations possible to generate a name that 
can violate the naming policy, its up to the GMs to decide if a name is 
offensive. The game already have a filter build in when you generate 
your character. That just means people try to get around that filter by 
use alternate methods of spellings, and thats when a GM have to see the 
name to decide if it violate the gaming police.
True, it can be up to the whim of the GM to do something about it, but 
thats what we have GMs for, to make choises like that.

A name like Gmsucks will for example of course be bannable, but a name 
like Gmmstrsscks will have to be looked at to see if its bannable or not.
