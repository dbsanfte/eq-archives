Just received my newest edition of Computer Gaming Monthly, and what do I
see? Fironia Vie riding a horse on the cover! Here's some of the choicer
cuts from the review:

"A moon where the good and evil cat-people keep on fighting their old war;
where vampyres prey on all races, where vacuum worms, fungal fiends, and
rockhoppers lurk."

"They're shooting for about 24 new zones, though they may exceed that
number. The zones will be large, but not quite as large as the Dreadlands in
Kunark (to give you longtime players a reference point.)"

"Well, look at those huge spires sprinkled throughout Norrath; those are the
transports. You'll need an item in your possession-yet to be determined, but
[Associate Producer Gordon] Wrinn assures us it would be easy for all
players to get."

"The bad news is that-as with the current game's boats- you'll still have to
wait. The teleport activates periodically, so you will need to be there
ahead of time."

"Sony Online is still fiddling with the abilities that the Vah Shir will
get, but it looks like you can expect them to have infravision, Sneak, and
Safe-Fall as native abilities."

"When you dismount, the horse will be unsummoned."

"If you do choose to fight on horseback, you can do so only while the horse
is not running. There will be no Apache-style bow fights while riding."

"Appropriate classes like Paladins and Shadow Knights may get a Summon
Warhorse spell."

"We'll have items that give faction boost while wearing them and other
things like a fire sword that's useful against an ice-based creature, but
not a fire monster, for example."

There's a lot more, like blurbs on the new wizzie familiars, but you'll have
to either:

A: buy the mag yourself.

B: bribe me with Dr Pepper and BBQ Pringles. Lots of them. :)
