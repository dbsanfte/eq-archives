Hey all, yesterday I was trying to get rid of this gaudy oversized
Bloodforge Hammer I had. I was preferably looking for a 1 or 2hb
staff for my druid. After a few auctions I get a reply by another druid
who has this staff. So we gladly traded. I thought it was weird because
he was a druid as well and this thing had +5 wis +30mana... oh well.

After researching the websites more <allakhazam's> I find that its
no longer dropped and worth 1,000pp?

Is this true? Did I get lucky or something?
