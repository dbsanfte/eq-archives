Against shit that you would have otherwise already been able to kill,
yes.  Against yellow/red cons?  Not a chance.  A level 12 wearing full
cobalt taking on a level 15+ mob would be doing a lot of CR.

9/19 weapon doesn't do dick when you're whiffing 75% of the time and
connecting for 1's and 2's while the mob is punching through your AC
for 20+ everytime.

Extreme twinking doesn't make the player "ultra powerful", all it does
is significantly reduces downtime for that player.

Fine, that's your opinion.  You are however wrong.
