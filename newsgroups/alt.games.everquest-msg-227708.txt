While I agree with everything else you said, you may have forgotten the
dry spell from 50ish to 58 where the druid's best heal is superior heal,
with cloroblast giving you a faster but less mana efficient heal part
way through. For someone who does like to group this can be a depressing
time if they are looking for pickup groups, you don't bring anything
that you particularly excel at to the group. If druids got Fist of
Karana at 56 instead of 58 they could at least quad their way through
the two worst levels where their healing is most pathetic but trying to
quad with the L50 spell by that point is pretty weak too. Lots of druids
have obviously done it but I don't know a lot that particularly enjoyed
it.
