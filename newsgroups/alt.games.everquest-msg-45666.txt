Here is simple firewall script that should work fine:
#!/bin/sh
# Enable IP forwarding
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
# Masquerade connections from 192.168.1.x to anywhere
# on the outside network (where eth0 is the external interface)
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 192.168.1.0/24 -o eth0 -d 0.0.0.0/0 -j
MASQUERADE

That's pretty insecure so you may want to read a Firewall-HOWTO or
IP-Masquerade-HOWTO from www.linuxdoc.org and add more.

There isn't a whole lot to screw up in configuring the Windows computer.
Just set the IP of the Ethernet card to something like 192.168.1.2, subnet
mask 255.255.255.0, and default gateway to whatever the IP of your Linux
computer's internal Ethernet card is.
