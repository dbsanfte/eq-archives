No one buys RDRAM, P4s suck.

and DDR Ram is definitely cheap as shit for the time being, I just got my
512MB (2x 256) of PC2100 DDR RAM from crucial today by fedex after ordering
it 2 and 1/2 days ago for a total cost of $107 including shipping.

I'd scan in the receipt but I don't have a scanner.
