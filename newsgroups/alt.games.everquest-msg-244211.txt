"Wired" magazine has another on-line article titled, "Virtual Trader
Barely Misses Goal" about a person who has a "real" job as a writer
but also is a virtual trader of UO goods, and wanted to see if he
could make more money as a trader than as a writer (but fell short by
$683).  There is a brief mention of EQ in the article.  The complete
article is available at:
