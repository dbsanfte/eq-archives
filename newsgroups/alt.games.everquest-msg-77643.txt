Ever wondered how to get free items and money on Everquest?  Well here is
the way.  Verant receives thousands of e-mails every day.   They set up bots
to return dynamic messages to the senders of the mails.  Almost every
possible email is covered by a bot.  Sending all of those replies often
creates far too much traffic to be sent out through one mail server.  Verant
uses many other web-based mail servers to "snake", or "crawl" the return
mail to the senders.  Unfortunately for Verant, regular people can abuse
these bots.  This is one of the best ways to do that.

All you have to do is send an email to one of their crawler accounts, Here
is one that I have found (because I received a letter from it) and have
found it to be much more responding then the others.

vi_recovery@hotmail.com

You must contain certain elements in the email for the server to respond to
you, this is the format that you must follow so that the server will
auto-respond in the same format, and not overlook your email.

Subject: Password Recovery

In the body of the email you must use this format:

(?"Your Station Name"?)


(?"Your Password"?)
(?"Your Server"?) *Sometimes used to verify an active account, not always
necesary*


("account that you want the password to")


The bot will recognize this as a request from Verant and automatically reply
the information to the sender.  You have to supply the first two parts so
that it knows an authorized user is attempting to get another password from
the account and it will not bother checking on the third part (the requested
name) it will decrypt and reply the password to the sender.  I have no idea
how long this crawler will be active and how long this particular bot will
be running, but have fun while it still is, down with Verant!!
