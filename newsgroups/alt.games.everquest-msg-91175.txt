	Yes, because they don't want everyone doing it.

	It takes human time to maintain the transfer system.

	According to Safehouse and the Glade, every raid-level mob was killed the
first day except possibly the fourth Warder (GMs were threatening to intervene
if someone tried to wake the Sleeper on Day One), the average character is
level 55 with epic, and there is one guild with 100 level 60 players (and 75
Sleeper's keys).

	I was signed up, and planned to transfer my 58 Ranger over, but my car
broke down and I didn't complete the billing authorization.  I think I may
have dodged a bullet here.
