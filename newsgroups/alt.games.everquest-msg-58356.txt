Not really looking for meaning( i actually like my role as secondary tank
and as is often the case puller).  I thought the same as you have listed
above until a lvl 52 ranger I was chatting with in game told me there was
more to it.  I was afraid I wasn't doing enough.  He had been on several(or
so he said) plane raids and was describing them and the roles of the various
classes in carrying them out.  From what I gather, the battery is the one
you want to be best friends with when rez time comes :)

Heard somewhere ranger has highest(with right tools and skills) aggro and
the ability to pull stuff off the casters.  I have not personally noticed
that to be true, and mez is definately a great means of crowd control.  It
must really be frustrating when people grouped with you don't stay on 1
target and break your mezzes :)

Thanks for your input, that is the type of discussion I wanted to generate.
