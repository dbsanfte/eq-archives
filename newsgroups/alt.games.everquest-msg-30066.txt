Case by case basis. That's why we have a jury system with real people
looking the accused in the face. We've seen fourteen year olds with the
cold steel look of hardened killers in their eyes. We've seen addled 40
year olds who chopped somebody's head off but couldn't tie their own
shoes. A good enough lawyer can certainly circumvent this in many
circumstances with enough legal chicanery, but at least there's a
chance.

See answer above. Same rules apply. You find a competent, aggresive 14
year old that can rape and butcher twenty women...... fry him. You find
a retarded 40 year old that killed an old woman while he was caught
stealing fig newtons in her back yard pantry.... probably not.

Goes back to the sad fact that we can't fry the parents.

Fair enough. Bleeding heart liberal.
