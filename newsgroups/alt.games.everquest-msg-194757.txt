Here's the difference between your system and ours:

Processor: 1.8GHz
RAM: She has 1GB
I have a TI4400, my wife has the same video card as you.

Everything else is the same. She has all models on, all the latest models,
and everything turned up, running at 1152x864.

No lag (except, of course, in the bazaar). All expansions.

Oh, and we are running DirectX 9 and the 45.72 Detonator drivers.
