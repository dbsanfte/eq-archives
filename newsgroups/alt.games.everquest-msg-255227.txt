I have google searched for this because I know it's been covered but I can't
find it.  There was a hotkey setup something like this:
/g Casting complete heal on %t - 10 seconds
/cast 2
/pause 10
/cast 2

What I can't remember is the length of the pause... in case the 1st one
fizzles...
Help please!
