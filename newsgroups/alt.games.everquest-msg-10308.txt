Oh my god. Did anyone else read the bit:

     "Females tend to get in groups faster, but we get harassed," said Aaron
Harvey, a 26-year-old freelance Web designer from Ventura who plays a female
gnome in "EverQuest." "People are constantly trying to pick us up. I've been
offered [more powerful weaponry] for cybersex, which I turn down rather
quickly."

and try to work out a question in they're heads with the words "more
powerful weaponry" in it?
