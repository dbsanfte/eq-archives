All those people lamenting that they'll never see the Sleeper if
someone wakes him should start anticipating the quest to bring him
back and look forward to that instead. Most of them should be just as
likely to be able to participate in something like that as they'd be
likely to ever get into ST and see him if he were left alone.

Personally, while I wish there could have been more gnome bards on
EMarr, I was happy for the guild that woke him up and enjoyed the
'newspaper' presentation of the news they had on their website :)
Why on earth should I begrudge them that experience? Because of
a few l33t weapons? I'm in a guild that's capable of doing quite a bit
with low numbers, several 'non-ideal' classes and without a single
primal weapon between us, and I don't think not having those is going
to hamper us in the future either.
