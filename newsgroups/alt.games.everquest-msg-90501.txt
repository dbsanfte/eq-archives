Given the choice of the two, I'd go for the shield.  But you should
get a paw of opolla and get the best of both worlds.  9ac 9wis, some
melee stats.

Most boring quest I ever did, but I sure felt great when I combined
the rings and got the paw.  And if you don't feel like hanging out in
Befallen for weeks, they're pretty cheap on most mature servers...


I leveled my druid up in the old days before kunark/velious/luclin
uber gear flowed like cheap wine at a frat party.  And up until level
44, I would usually "porcupine" when I solo'd.  

Porcupining is when you buff up, including damage shield and regen,
pull a nasty mob, and let it beat itself to death on your damage
shields.  

Perhaps not as efficient as quad kiting, but more fun. :)
