OK, this may not work for everyone, but it did for me:
comp specs Cele 400 /256 mb/ RAM GE Force 2 mx 32 mb
I was not getting past the Verant screen, instead of the movie then login I
would go black and have to ctrl alt del to get back to desktop. So I did the
reinstall of Directx 8.1 the way they tell you to at everquest's official
site. Set my display adapter to standard VGA, reinstalled DX 8.1 then the
new drivers from Nvidia.com. I then rebooted and YAY!!! it works! Sure its a
lil choppy right now and zoning is hellishly slow, but I am a glass half
full guy, it will hopefully get better w new patches. I hope this helps.
