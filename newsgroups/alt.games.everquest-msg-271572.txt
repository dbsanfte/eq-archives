Virtue or better has similar issues when you are not grouped with a 
cleric...

It can be quite a lot of fun.  I am still missing my very best heals, and 
consequently, cannot (maybe even after I get them) keep up with healing 
indefinitely in places like PG.  In a pinch, I can fill in for the cleric 
for a while, like when he gets whacked by an add :b.  But, I will run out 
of mana, even canning away.
