I have a close friend working on an enterprise team to deliver a
project in five sites across the continent, in 12-months, on five
different legacy systems, with three different managements and four
primary vendor relationships. Over 500 core modules to design, code,
and test before integration and load-testing, with parallel user
training and certification. Six programmers wouldn't even have been
able to read the business analysis and do 100 of the modules in that
time.

The scale of software projects has changed. Perhaps your environment
has shielded you from some of that.

 As far as the graphics, most games I've seen the

I don't know, but just for asking, how many textures were required in,
say, GTA:Vice City, versus Wasteland?

It's not any more. With console titles it's a bigger industry than the
domestic movie biz. You can't totally ignore cross-over work and
revenues.

 You can't have a company of

It depends what those 3000 people are doing. If 10 of them are profit
centers and the rest staff I agree with you. Or if half are profit
centers, but have a superstar attitude that leads to uncontrolled
expense account abuse. (Cough--Ion Storm--cough.)

I get so sick of designers whining "But we're artists! Business
reality doesn't apply to us!"

The proper question is: Could you sell Wasteland for $50 today? No.
You couldn't give it away.

And Henry Ford got rich selling Model Ts for $700. Then nobody wanted
them at any price.

You can't ignore that. It's a key data point.

By design. The industry was never going to get bigger than movies by
selling to the 200,000 geeks like you and me who were interested in
1985.

I rarely buy them, and when I

I'm sorry. I find myself buying about 20% as many games as I did in
1985, but enjoying them a whole lot more. I research them well, and I
play the hell out of them. I expect to be playing some form of Civ
until I die. The disposable dollars I used to send to games on a whim
now go to DVDs, mostly of movies and TV series I know I'll like and
want to archive. Most of the time I'm watching a DVD I'm also playing
a PC game, however.
 
 Well, that's fine,

I hear sour grapes. In reality us fossils are being joined by millions
of people who are normal, and increasingly, female. The average age of
a PC gamer has never been higher.

So why is "The Sims 2" coming out on PC first?
