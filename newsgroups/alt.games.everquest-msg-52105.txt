Fear is the best approach to a caster mob, shuts it right down and turns
it into easy prey, since most caster mobs have fewer HP for their level.

Its been a couple weeks, but I don't recall my 22 necro having any stun
capablities.  Your warrior, on the other hand, should be able to keep
spell casting to a minimum by watching carefully for a "begins casting"
message, and responding with a bash.  If you are crippled by not being
a large race, make that a slam... either way, a crucial warrior skill.  The
point is to interrupt the spell.  Anything with a decent cast time on it
you should be able to get to, this is the technique I use as a cleric, since
the Stun spell has a very short cast time.

Going after a caster with green support, I'd still target the caster for
first destruction.  While you might normally want to kill greens off first
in a mass melee, so as to cut down on the number of mobs swinging
away or aggroing off on the wrong person, EQ caster NPCs have
practically unlimited mana and are usually disproportionately effective
if allowed to cast freely, and at the same time (as I mentioned before) have
relatively low HP, so they shouldn't take any longer than a green tank
mob.

Worst possible mob, AFAIK, is a healer.  These guys will make you
fight the fight several times over if you can't keep them from casting,
with their highly effective heals and practically infinite mana.  If you
decide to go after green mobs with a healer around you may find yourself
unable to kill -anything-  Face multiple mixed healers and tanks and you're
really in a mess... as most people who've pulled orcs in Oasis have
sooner or later discovered to their detriment.  Of course in Oasis its just
a question of isolating your pulls so you dont' get the Priests in with anything
else, but there are places in Norrath where you are just stuck facing
mixed teams.
