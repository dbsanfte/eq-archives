I have heard 7 hours, but I've never picked one and then stood around
for seven hours to find out.

The thing in the hut (the diary, I think?) is pretty much on the normal
traffic route across Kithicor. Good news, because it means you just
check it while passing thru... bad news because people who have
no idea what its for will pick it up, and its no drop.  This means that
it isn't there quite often.  You could stick around and wait for it until
it gets dark out, you will only have to deal with some wandering bixies
during the day.

The thing on the stump  is hard to get to, noone stumbles across it
casually.  This means that generally you wait till you happen to get
the thing in the hut (gee, I wish I remember which was which.  Diary
in the hut, I bet)  then you jog over and get the thing on the stump.
If you are excedingly unlucky and its not there, bind on top of the
stump and leave, gate back in the next day.  Just don't do anything
dangerous during that night and get yourself dead and naked on
top of that stump at midnight!
