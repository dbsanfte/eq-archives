It's been a while since I've really hunted with my 46 druid. Having 7
other characters does that kinda thing to ya. >< Anyway, quadding
Ulthorks has fizzled xp-wise for a while now. The warriors are okay,
but that spawn are is heavily hunted and I find myself having to
settle for hunters if I try hunting there. For several levels, I
root-DOTed frost giants (finally reaching dubious with CoV), but
that's slow going. I can do the same with Wyverns in CS, but after a
couple run-ins with an idiot shaman training the...Bulthor? CS's
walrus men...all the way up the shore and back, I decided CS wasn't
healthy right now.

People have suggested quadding in BW, but I really can't familiarize
myself enough with the layout not to get disoriented, and the fact
that the mobs tend to be hard to come by 4 of the same type (until
I've finally got 4 snared, then they're everywhere all of a sudden and
adding onto my pull. :-/ ). Just isn't exactly a place I'm comfortable
hunting in when it comes down to it. Dawnshroud is a tad laggy for
me...

As for DL...just...No. Same reason I won't hunt in LOIO or Oasis.

Are there any other good solo options for a 46 druid, or am I stuck
having to settle for one of them?
