Ah, but it's a different situation, my esteemed shaman.

On a HoT raid, the mobs are a) relatively stationary while being tanked and
b) debuffed senseless.  Tash, Malo, Malosinia, Ro's Fiery Sundering, you
name it these poor worms are hit with it.  Also, they're nicely
color-coded - red ones are fire resistant, white ones are cold resistant,
green ones are poison resistant, brown ones are druids and need the nasty DS
dispelled/MoK'd.

So, for example, let's say a nice juicy white Guardian comes into camp.  I
step back behind the wall, avoid the AOE and look calm while the tank does
the tank thing and the shamans, enchanters, druids, and mages do the debuff
thing.  By the time they're done, the mob is at 90 pct health or so.  This
is important; rain resists are much higher on full-health and about-to-die
mobs.  Now step around the corner and encant your rains; you have to stay
line-of-sight to get damage from them but you can do other things while the
rains fall down - Xuzl, re-epic, Concussion, a second rain, whatever.  This
is a white, so you're using fire or magic based rains - for a red, use cold
or magic based.  Duck behind the wall if the AOEs are eating into you, stop
in any case when the mob hits 20pct as resists go back up (if you note, it's
the same time that mobs start hitting for more or running).

In my experience, I find that for every five rains I drop under these
conditions, three will hit full and two will hit for two waves.  With a
wizard's spells, I get even-up mana efficiency between rains and nukes if I
get two waves to stick, and the third is gravy.  So, 13 waves of 650 is
respectable damage for a single wizard (8450), and I paid for 10 of them,
getting 3 waves or 1950 damage for free.  Best of all, I'm at 60 pct mana,
no problem medding to full before the next attack and a very healthy reserve
if we get an add, or the clerics shout LOM and I need to overburn and get
things dead.

Anecotal?  In part.  I don't remember the exact numbers I got when I parsed
my log, and my work computer doesn't have my home computer's EQ logs for me
to fiddle with.  And I agree that against non-debuffed mobs, rains are
problematic at best.  But in a raid setting where you have plenty of
debuffs - especially if you want to do some damage and not get aggro, say
you've got a low-aggro MA - then rains can be well worth the time.  They're
just not the answer to every problem - they're situational.
