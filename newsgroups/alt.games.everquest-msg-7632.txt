Oh, I hadn't fully thought it out, yet... haven't done anywhere near enough
research, and don't even know that acronyms for the uber warrior gear, yet.
(yeah, yeah, I know FBSS is really good... but just what is a "Yak"?)

In fact, I haven't fully settled my mind on a warrior.  I was thinking I
want a melee class, just to have gone to the other end of the spectrum.

I had basically planned to give him/her the widest array of uber gear I can,
to give my little cream filled treat the widest range of options possible
for dealing with any given MOB (hit hard but slow, fast and furious, one
hand, two handed, range, bashing, turtling, etc...).  I don't pretend to
know the best combination for every situation for a melee class, so I intend
to give my melee as many options as possible from the word go, and learn the
best way for me the same way I do now... by expirimentation.

Of course I have about 20 more levels as a caster before I had even planned
to start a melee... so I still have some time to work it out.
