I wouldn't give a hoot if the EBayers were an island unto themselves.
They are not.
In your example it would be more fitting that the child put his rod on the
ground to take a wiz while the heavily laden uber fisherman stepped on the
Childs pole then blamed the child because he could not be bothered to look
where he was going.
Don't kid yourself. Many exp deaths are caused by Ebayers that are EQ
noobies. Why buy the game go get it on EBAY !.

Maybe they could have an Ebay server. Keep the noobs in one spot.

To further your example the uber fisherman probably wants to fish with
several lines at once.
Hey why not he can afford it.
That's why there are rules, well in this province any way,  about how many
lines per fisherman you can have.
