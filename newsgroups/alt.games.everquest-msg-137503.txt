Foamy has a lot more credibility than you..  You have constantly taken
all the facts and evidence that has been thrown at you, in every
discussion you are involved in and either twisted it, questioned it or
plume ignored it...

You don't WANT evidence because it will bring down that pedastal you
have put yourself on in that glass house of yours...

But like Lesa, you CAN'T know what he meant.  Because it proves you
for the liar that you are...

You ARE to blame because you intentionally fail to see the obvious
meaning in things...

Not by you he won't...  You don't like it when people use logic and
rational argument, because it shows you for the complete ignorant
person that you are.

There is no harm or dishonor in being ignorant, BS...

It's only when you BS your way thru and try and convince people you
actually know what you are talking about that is the dishonor..

So, you are saying that you don't HAVE an opinion.. You are just
spewing the opinion of others...

We'll add weak-willed to your list of accolades...

Funny how if we strip out all the personal attacks of your posts,
nothing would remain...
