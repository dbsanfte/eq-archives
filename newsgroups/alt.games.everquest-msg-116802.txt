If *you* know how much a port costs, and everyone *else* knows how much
they cost, then why not just state that in your /auc, rather than
messing about with ambiguous terms and assuming everyone else knows
donation >= 30pp through some kind of worldwide osmosis.

I hope that when people (like me) think 50-100pp is fair for a port, you
correct them and return the difference.

Yup, it's the same as 'make offer'. 
It means 'I know what I want, but I'm hoping you'll give me more if I
don't let you know exactly what I want'
