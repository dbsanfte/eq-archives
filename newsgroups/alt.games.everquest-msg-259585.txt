    The one thing I see missing that is important to every ENC is spell
haste. Likely the easiest way for you to get it would be to remove the mana
regen 1 augment from your Frozen Ring and get a Glowing Ore of Rapid Thought
(type 3 aug, 1150 points, Rujark theme, Spell Haste IV) to replace it. You
could also buy a Ceramic Totem of Xegony and range-slot it, too. There are
other spell haste IV items, and a few droppable Haste of Solusek items
(don't accept anything slower), but many of them would displace something
more important.

    Right now I'd suggest waiting for OoW in two weeks. The gear from there
will likely change your gear plan, especially as you try for level V foci.
In particular be on the lookout for anything good in the neck slot - that
seems to be your weakest slot right now, unless you're still using C3.
