First make SURE that both your desktop and EQ are running under 32bit
color.

Download and install the newest release of DirectX (8.1b) from
microsoft.
www.microsoft.com/directx

If you have a via Motherboard make sure you have the 4.38 or newer
4in1 drivers.

You might want to try the newest beta drivers for your GF3. I am using
the Detonator 30.30s from www.3dguru.com
