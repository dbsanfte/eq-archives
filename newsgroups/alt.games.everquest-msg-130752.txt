The higher level real druids will be cheering, myself included, since it
means slightly less morons asking you (while you're in somewhere like ToV or
Hate) for a port from steamfont to BB.

The lower level druids probably won't be thrilled if that's how they made
mone, but will still figure out a way to port whore themselves if they're so
inclined.

The portbot/alt dr00ds made to make money will probably scream like
children, but who cares about them anyways?  Not me.
