I've been having problems with my Linksys ( not the old disconnect problem 
) and decided to upgrade the firmware last night.  At 20%, it lost 
connection to the Linksys.  Fried BIOS.  Now I have a good reason to get a 
new router =)  I'm thinking wireless.

Does anyone here use a NetGear or LinkSys 4 ( or more ) port wireless cable 
/ DSL router with EQ?  I'll be running 2 accounts on 2 PCs and my wife will 
have a PC on the network.  Any latency / lag / other problems that you guys 
have encountered with a similar setup?
