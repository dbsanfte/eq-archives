Since this was in response to a remark suggesting zoning in invis,
I have to agree: many NPCs will give that response if you try to
interact with them while invis (or feigning death).  (Thank heavens
sneak is usually okay! :-)

Oh, and regarding the earlier bit:

>> There *IS* a reason to bolt for the camp. targeting the magus and tapping
>> enter on your already typed out 'nedaria' will zap you out of harms way.

I'll mention as an aside that I found it useful to create a bank of
hotkeys each of which says "/target Magus" and "/say <destination>".
Since the transport NPC is always Magus <something> the keys work
from every camp.  I did have to practice a bit to figure out how
close I had to be to get the Magus to react, but that's true on the
"tapping enter" approach, too.

Not that I use this to dump trains in camps, mind you.  But it does
let me run to a camp and zone across without breaking stride.

Oh, and if anyone decides to copy this idea, be warned that the hotkey
should also include "/attack off" before targetting the Magus. :-)
