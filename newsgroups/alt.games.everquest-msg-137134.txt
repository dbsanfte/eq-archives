I am such a fashion disaster. I am still using the same soggy mackeral to
beat people to death with that I was using back in 84. I guess I will have
to face upgrading sometime soon though, as the mackeral in question has
definately seen better days.

People these days have so little patience too, they won't even stay still
long enough enough to me smeared to death with vile substances..
