DoTs do do damage while they run, but supposedly less than if it were rooted
or aggroed on a person or pet, I have no idea and there's really no way to
prove it.

Specialization generally depends whether you primarily:
A) Solo :  Evocation for better mana use on kiting.
B) Group, as Healer+ :  Alteration, better heals, and snare (you should be
snaring everything, it doesn't break mez also), also root, but that's not
too important.
C) Group, as Buff Bitch : If you buff a LOT, Abjuration,but this is a fairly
odd choice. (probably good if you do nothing but PL people =P  )
D) Group, as Wannabe Wizzy : EVOCATION, just like a real Wizard.
