Stonebrunt has two places that seem like unutilized (yet to be utilized)
zone lines.  I am guessing it's for adding on either a dungeon off of
stonebrunt or a zone beyond stonebrunt or both.  My original map of
Norrath lists both The Vasty Deep and The Barren Coast as being beyond
Stonebrunt.  It may be they will connect to Luclin somehow, as the cats
in Stonebrunt don't hate erudites like the cats on Kerra isle do, so
it's entirely possible that there will be something added to the zone
via the SoL expansion or it may just be another "free" zone added in the
future.
