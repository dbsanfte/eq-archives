As far as I have been able to tell, yes.  I've used stuns to hold
agro from unstunnable mobs (Velious giants, for instance) and did
not notice that I had to cast more often to do so than with mobs
that are affected by the stun.  Also, in LDoN a resisted stun seems
to turn the mob to me just fine (not 100%, an early CHeal, resisted
slow, or over eager Wizard can easily exceed the agro from a single
stun, resisted or not).

James' question/suggestion may be on target.  I hardly ever use
my stun+dd spells, in fact I'm not sure I've used them at all
since Luclin came out and I got 2 more zero damage stuns, so I
don't really have any idea whether they're different when resisted.
