Except the scout in this case can more effectively pull without building
much aggro and be able to head out after another mob when the previous 
one gets near death.

This is all part of a highly effective group. This is what you shoot 
for. Your simplification comes at the cost of lower efficiency and, IMO, 
reduces the game to boring button mashing.

If your group is having trouble, then sure, keep it simple, but if you 
want to really shine, utilize the skills of all group member efficiently 
and thereby most effectively.
