Auto-stand for casting will work when fd.  I fd and then click my drum to
get mounted again, which is a little easier than fd, stand, click drum.  The
one thing that I don't like about the auto-stand when casting is that you
can't turn it off.  There is an option in the options menu to disable it,
but even turned off it still happens.
