Hehe, tell me about it. Had to get to Everfrost, and after that LONG run a damn barbarian guard
kills me.
Youll also be KOS in FV, and for gods sake do NOT try to use Wolf form on Kerra Isle (hey,
theyre all cat people, guess how they react on dogs). Kerra Isle is the first place i managed to
make a 20+ train (invis broke at an unlucky time, didnt know about the problems with wolf form
then).
And your not all safe in Oggok, a big bad bartender in the back of Oggok will kill you anyway.
