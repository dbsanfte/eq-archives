I have a human bard too, so I can relate. Your two best options are a 
Glowing Stone Band (ridiculously cheap these days in Bazaar) or even 
better, head to lower Guk and ask to be allowed to loot a Mask of 
Deception (the old Guise of the Deceiver) off the Ghoul Assassin, which 
is NO DROP and generally rots. This has a right-click effect of Illusion: 
Dark Elf.
