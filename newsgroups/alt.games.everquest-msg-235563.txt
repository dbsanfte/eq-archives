this post hits it on the head! the "destruction of the economy" is a farce.
just because it costs more to TWINK your toons doesnt mean the game is
screwed up. If you dont like the prices DONT GO TO THE BAZAAR. I personally
was upset about bazaar pricing myself but then started doing more ldons and
now have enough points to get myself some awesome gear. The one aspect I do
wish sony would change is to increase the drop rate of 65 spell runes or
move all game spells to vendors.

that paragraph sums it all up for me!
