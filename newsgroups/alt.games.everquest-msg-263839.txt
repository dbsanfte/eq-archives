Actually, (correct me if I'm wrong.. I'm sure somebody will), you get
*less* experience as a quantitative numerical value per kill if you
are the lower level, than your groupmate who is of higher level.
However, this is skewed by:

a) since you are lower level the mobs give more xp overall and your
split is larger

b) since you are lower level the same numberical value say 100 for
example is a greater portion of the total amount required to complete
your current level, and thus may be a greater percentage of your
current level

c) since you are lower level, and there are higher level players,
you'll likely kill more mobs faster, therefore generating more
experience overall.

Other things affect XP such as ZEM (should be the same for both),
leadership aa, regular aa, racial xp mods.
