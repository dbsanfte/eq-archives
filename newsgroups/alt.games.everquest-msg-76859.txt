I can't think of any abuse other than VI just doesn't want people to
have no exp loss deaths ever.

If it's on a 72 min timer, the cleric can die as often as he wants and
he will NEVER lose exp (which can be useful in a very small set of
situations).  Probably not something VI has in their all important
"vision".

Of course that 3 day real life timer is just kinda stupid.  Making it
3.5 hours would have sufficed.
