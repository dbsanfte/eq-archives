I'm sorry, but I just can't agree with you here.  The whole trip
to Nadox (lava entrance) from PoK takes me less than the 10min
duration of my improved invis spell.  The trip to SB is about half
of that, so your overall savings getting a port is <5minutes.

Of course, remember - I'm bound in WW next to ToV and I think nothing
of running to the GD book from there (just barely longer than T-boots
duration) rather than hanging around the WW entrance to SG crying for
a porter to pick me up.
