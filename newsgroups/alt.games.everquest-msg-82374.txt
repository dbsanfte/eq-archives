What an odd thing to say.

But perhaps you've finally grasped that argument by way of authority
isn't valid.  Now you need to work on recognizing it when it actually
occurs.

And this is where you fall down, skitter down a rocky slope for two

And then burst into flames like a Pinto some errant kid flicked a

But basically you're right; it doesn't matter.  But it also doesn't
seem to have any place in the argument.
