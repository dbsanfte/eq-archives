To all:

One of my characters is a 20/21 Iksar Warrior with his eye on
purchasing an item I need to raise money for.  What is the quickest
way to raise approx 150 Plat? I am currently hunting in Field of Bone
and/or Lake of Ill Omen. Are there certain items I should harvest such
as Sabertooth Fangs or Shields that sell for decent plat or do certain
Mobs yield more than others?

Thanks a lot for your time.

-Robert.
