I once got stuck on a chair in the smaller bank on PoK. I had closed
the bank and was moving away when I got stuck. Turned, jumped, sat,
etc., then just waited 30+ seconds then did /rewind and *poof* I was
free (I was back looking at the banker but bank windows was not open,
fyi).

Haven't been that badly stuck since.
