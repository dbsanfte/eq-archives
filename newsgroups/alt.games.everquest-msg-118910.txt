Since I'm bored out of my mind with EQ at the moment (I spend a lot more 
time in the newsgroup than I do in the game, and when I'm logged in all I'm 
trying to do is get my fishing to 200), I've come up with the idea of 
turning into the Grim Reaper.

For this, I obviously need three things: A white horse (I can come up with 
the cash if I port like crazy for a few sessions), a scythe (there are a 
few in the game), and a skeleton. Right now, my options for this last item 
are a) Amulet of Necropotence for Hanrahan. (too expensive) b) Leveling my 
Enchanter to 24 for Illusion: Skeleton or c) Leveling my Necromancer to 34 
for Call of Bones. I would prefer option b), since I wouldn't have to worry 
about my HP while the illusion is on and it's fewer levels to go, but I 
don't know if there are any weapons or items that are equippable by an 
Enchanter and have a scythe graphic.

Any suggestions?
