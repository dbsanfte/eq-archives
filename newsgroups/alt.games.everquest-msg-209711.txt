Just as walking up to a woman in a singles bar and sticking your hand into her
bra is rude while sending her a smile from across the room and making a gesture
towards the dance floor is not; targetting someone and clicking invite without
so much as a "wanna team up?" is rude while sending someone a tell asking if
they'd like to group (and hopefully including your group composition and levels
and perhaps a choice of target) is polite

Rude isn't what you do, nor where you do it, its HOW you do what you do.

It may suggest it, but the conclusion is far from certain.  In many zones you'll
find a wide variety of mobs of varying levels.  And many zones can only be
reached by travelling thru other zones.  And many zones have supplies of one
sort or another that are either convenient to buy there, or can -only- be gotten
there (via purchase, killing, foraging, ground spawn, fishing...)  Or you may be
there to do a favor for  a friend (rez him, buff him, port him, drop off
something for him, PL him...)

Or you may be high enough level to not be able to group with someone for exp
while still being low enough to get exp off the same mobs that the other guy
can; a mob that is even con to a level 5 is still blue to a level 11, for
example, even though the level 11 would prevent the level 5 from getting exp in
a group.

Even barring the "can't get exp" restriction, some people don't want to group
with people several levels lower than themselves, feeling that they would be
"carrying" the lower levels, doing most of the work but sharing out the exp.  Or
some don't want to group with higher levels, feeling that they won't be able to
contribute much to the hunt, which can be less than fun, or feeling that the
high levels will suck up most of the exp while contributing little more than
someone of appropriate level.

He's often that way, don't take it personally.  But there is a point there; he's
saying that yes indeed, people -do- kill greens for cash, for faction, for trade
skill drops, for quest drops... and he has no patience with those who refuse to
ever consider such a thing.

So do I, but that makes us the exceptions, not the rule; most people will
happily kill hill giants in RM long after they go green, simply because they
drop about as much cash as any mob in the game; more than most their level, and
above that level mobs stop dropping more and more cash, they just get harder to
kill.   In fact, HG are generally pretty poor exp, the RM ZEM isn't all that and
a bag of chips, and they have proportionally high HP totals and damage output,
in short, killing HG purely for exp isn't the best use of your time.  Kill them
for loot while they are exp level... well you could be killing something else
for more exp on the same effort, so in a way you are giving up exp for cash,
those who kill them when they are green (and pretty easy) are just giving up
even more exp for the cash.

Sure it is.  Saying your opinion wasn't worth a fuck is also rude, despite the
fact that you aren't there in RL.   Rude doesn't have anything to do with your
distance from the person you are talking to, nor with your means of connection.
Its a question of social mores.

But that doesn't have anything to do with whether their actions are rude or
not.  Biz might be one of the kindest gentlest people you'll ever meet IRL, but
in this NG he's very often a blunt ended screwt, ruder than his own mother.  For
all you know his character in EQ is a cutthroat KSing SOB, or perhaps a white
lace clad cavalier of a paladin, the very height of civility.

Interestingly, he could even play that same paladin with all in game courtesy
but still using -game mechanic- based rudenesses like this invite thing, polite
IC but rude IG.  IG is closer to RL than IC is, if it comes to that, as IG is
what you the player do, while IC is what your character does.

IF you walk up to that young lady in that bar we were talking about and feel her
up, she can also just walk away, no harm done.  Or tell you she doesn't want to
fuck you.  But that doesn't mean you were right in approaching her in that way.
You've assaulted her without so much as a "by your leave", and in our culture
that isn't taken lightly.  Well, in EQ, asking to group is -also- an invitation
to an intimate relationship, sharing the life blood of the game, the exp you get
off mobs and quests.  Its considered rude to do that by clicking invite instead
of by approaching the invitee beforehand with an offer in tells or say (or OOC
or shout or auction or guild or, well, something!)

Unless the person playing the game is not sitting at his keyboard, perhaps using
a macro or something to run his character while he is away, he -is- in Real
Life.  Just as I am really sitting here writing this reply.  I'm not sitting
there in front of you, I'm seperated from you by time, medium, and a certain
modest degree of anonymity... but I really do exist, and my choices are those of
a real person.  This isn't Baldur's Gate, where everyone you encounter
(monsters, bad guys, good guys, even your group mates assuming you aren't
playing a multiplayer version of the game) is a programmed bit of code.

Now if I am running my ogre shadowknight, and I run up to your halfling cleric
and beging eyeing him up and talking about the recipee for hot and spicy
toelings, thats my character acting in a way I wouldn't; I'm indeed no cannibal
(nor intellivore, if you'll grant me that an ogre eating a hobbit isn't a
cannibal after all). Its rude, but its rude in character, not in game terms. But
if my SK drops down at your feet in a FD, dumping half a dozen angry orcs on
you, thats rude in game as well as in character, and its rude of me in real life
to have done it.  Same time, if my ogre /em grabs %t's left tit and gives it a
squeeze, thats rude of him in character and of me in real life, unless we've
established that that sort of thing is indeed acceptable between us.

Asking that person if he wants to group is not rude (in fact it may be the
height of courtesy.)  Inviting him without his asking, on the other hand, often
is.  If he has an LFG flag on and isn't killing anything, it might be in the
grey area... but still on the rude side of that area.  Many people won't mind
it, just as many young women won't mind a slap on the rump as an invitation to
dance at the right sort of gathering; that doesn't mean Mrs. Manners would
approve, just that in this case the rudeness is acceptably low.

For that you won't have to wait long, but just because the drivel content is
high doesn't mean the signal to noise ratio is zero.
