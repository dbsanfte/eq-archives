Once again, however, all this information can be found on the websites
I listed. Caster's Realm especially has complete spell lists and skill
lists for each class, as well as user-submitted strategy discussion.
There is nothing in the guide that can't be found for free on the web.
Me, I have a binder with spell lists from CR printed out as well as
trade skill recipe lists from EQTraders. If I need a map to a new
area, I go to Allakhazam's and follow a link to the EQAtlas map of the
area and print it out for use until I'm familiar with the area. The
only cost to me is the printer ink and paper used (Plus $3.33/month I
use to support Allakhazam's. Trivial cost to help keep such a useful
site going.)
