You are already getting beyond the "weapon" phase of an int caster's
life, if there ever was such a phase. Instead you should be looking
for a holdable like the stien of mugguck or something. A chanter can
do that quest for it solo but I think at higher than 12, they are sold
pretty cheap though. Your melee days are over. I'd group when I could
or med while your pet beats on something until you cast the next
spell.
