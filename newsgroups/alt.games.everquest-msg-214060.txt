Can you think of any case where there's 10 people you know who are all the same
class, above or nearly to the level to mem a spell, don't already have the
spell, but do have easy access to three copies?

The effort it would take to get the price down on the remaining 7 copies you
need would be better spent getting them yourself if you are capable of getting
3 copies.

If you bought the three copies at 7kpp each, then you've just put a big prop
under that price.  People who are paying attention to prices know that the
thing is moving at 7kpp.  People who aren't paying attention are very hard to
manipulate.

And if there -are- 7 more copies of the spell out there on vendors and the
price is sticking at 7kpp, then the odds are its because there are lots of
customers for it at that price.  So when you put up your dummy copy at 6900 or
6800, one of the many buyers who have been coming along willing to pay 7Kpp
will buy yours, and there goes your manipulation tool.

When you do this sort of thing with a stack of spiderling silk, having someone
buy you out isn't a disaster.  Having one of the 10 copies of a spell you
collectively need lost to an effort to save a few plat, thats another story.
