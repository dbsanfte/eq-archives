They lie in the casinos. They use shills, and they often go LD before
big payouts. We talked about prograssive betting here, well they have
all kind of "suicide" systems to play. They usually maximize the hous
ewinnings, and not the player winnings.

IMHO, there are no honest casinos, unless they have a different game,
and they play where they will not bother others. They eventually
revert to the LD scam. It is a regular story. It is like drunk
driving, eventually you are going to wreck or get caught.

TO win one more time than the dealer it is a 1 in 10 chance. To win
two more times it is a 1 in 40 chance.

I can't add every single sucker to ignore and why should I have to.
Lets say I want a port, and the porter once played a casino?

DO you run one? Sounds like it. It is not a entertainment. It is a
scam. They use SHills, they go LD, they loe to you about chances. Does
an honest game need that?

It is disturbing to people around them, like when they set up in the
POK bank or set up in a Bazaar bank. I want it to stop and by widely
publicizing the real truth I think I can get this practice to stop.
