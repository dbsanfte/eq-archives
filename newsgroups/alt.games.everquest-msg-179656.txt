Perspective indeed!

The expansions are waaaaaaaaaaaay too expensive.  If I buy a game for my PC,
I pay roughly $50.  This entitles me to play it by myself for a limitless
amount of time (with some games, this is possible) plus play online
(assuming the game supports this) as often as I want for *free*.  I offer
Neverwinter Nights as an example of this.

I play EQ only *gasp* once a week, for 5 hours.  It's not a dollar a day for
me!  It's closer to a dollar an hour!  For the casual player (and I say
"casual" as I have a real job, family, and other concerns which fill a
majority of my time) Everquest is far too expensive to consider.  I don't
have all the expansions, only Luclin & Kuniark (which I bought at an extreme
discount,) and have one character above 30th (and just barely.)  I'm
considering quitting (after a year or so of playing) as the cost is far too
high for me, and my regular group is splitting up due to a personality
conflict.  It's not worth $168 a year in fees to play this game, when I
could buy 3 or 4 games for that money with more content and play value, and
enjoy them more.

Now I'm expected to buy two expansions a year for $20-$30 each in addition
to the fees?   I think not.  They should be free to subscribers (or only the
cost of the CD itself.)

Either that, or Sony needs to implement a scalable fee structure based on
usage, with a maximum cap at $14.   This might encourage more "casual"
players such as myself to remain (or join.)  I'd be at around $5 probably,
and that would be cheap enough for me to continue buying the expansions.
