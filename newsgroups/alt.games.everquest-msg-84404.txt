>So, pretty much what is being said is that it was a HUGE mistake for anyone
>to categorize this game as an online role-playing game?

No.

What is being said is that you need to warn other players when you are
Role-Playing. You have to be extra careful to warn them, if you are
RP'ing an angry/evil character.

If I come up to you, and you start acting rude or angry when I cast a
spell on your character, I have no way of knowing if you are RPing or
being a jerk.

Example 1:
Human_Druid_01: Casting Heal on Iksar_Monk_01
Iksar_Monk_01: How dare you interfer with my battle! I don't need your
pathetic help! Take your magic and stuff it!

Jerk or RPer? 

Example 2: (/ttell sends a private message to a targeted player)
Human_Druid_01: /say "Casting Heal on Iksar_Monk_01"
Iksar_Monk_01: /say "How dare you interfer with my battle! I don't
need your pathetic help! Take your magic and stuff it!"
Iksar_Monk_01:  /ttell "I am RPing"
Human_Druid_01: /say "Tunare loves all creatures that walk the lands
of Norrath. Even the foul and twisted Iksar. Her gifts are given
freely, even to those who do not appreciate them."

Cheers
