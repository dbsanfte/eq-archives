on a related note, does anyone have a color scheme that they are proud of.

ie. see all con messages clearly (as these can't be changed)
see all messages when in full screen (background color can be changed) and
spellbook (background color CANNOT be changed)

if so please do a copy and paste from your eqclient.ini

i thought i had sorted out my colours and backgrounds, untill i started a
low lvl  caster.
all my staring at spellbook text couldn't be seen.

if someone has found a perfect set that works for both ,please post.
obviously using lots of different colours for all the different text types,
and important messages in warning colours. eg/ it would be sensible to have
"your spell wears off" messages in red.
