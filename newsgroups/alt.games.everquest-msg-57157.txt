Unbelievable. Most people complain about software because it is not
updated often enough and bugs, as a result, stay in too long. EQ
players complain because the company is constant updating the software
and fixing bugs.

Think of it this way: You can't play EverQuest 24/7. Verant is giving
you at least one mandatory break a month. Go outside and play.
