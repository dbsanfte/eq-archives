DF belts are less exp than CB belts, and CB belts are less exp than CB
shoulderpads, and CB shoulderpads are less exp than GLS... further,
all the belts and pads quests produce relatively little cash, the GLS quest
is the only one I can think of where the items are routinely sold for
less than the return on investment after doing the quest.  For more
exp quests, move on to Aviak Claws (off island in OOT, to Kaladim)
and then Aviak Charms (Centaurs in SRo) but neither of these
quests are profitable.

GLS hunting works well if you are a class that finds wisps good exp
prey while you hunt.  The GLS itself drops relatively rarely, and if
you are of a level where wisps aren't decent exp, its probably more
profitable to kill bandits or something that drops a more regular, if
less valuable loot.  I wasn't touting GLS quest as the end all be all,
however, just commenting that selling them to vendors at 3pp really
isn't getting your best deal at all.  Heck, I've had several of my
twink characters buy them from vendors at 13pp a pop just because
the exp was quick and easy and the money meaningless at that low
level.

Or just being a banker:  Take your meager horde of PP and buy
people's gold with the stipulation that they throw in their silver
and copper.  Coin is heavy and the small stuff ends up getting
destroyed just to prevent loss of mobility and agility.  Get that
Druid to 19 and he can bind himself in a distant zone with lots of
cash drop (say Rathe Mountains) then port to near a bank (sadly
it -will- be a couple zone run still at his level, I think Surefall may
now be closest port to bank) and change back into light weight
pp for another go.
