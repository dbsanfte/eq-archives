Hmmm...someone told me that there was PvP in WoW that was similar to DAoC.
That is, a PvP zone, where the PvP was restricted to people of the other
group (I never played any of the Warcraft RTS games, so don't know what the
sides were).  Anyway, they described it as a lot like PvP in DAoC, except
with only two sides instead of three.

Were they just confused, or were they talking about how it is on non-PvP
servers, or what?
