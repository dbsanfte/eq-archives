Surely when you camp the Macro stops? Imagine you wanted to build up one of
your spell skills. You could make a macro that constatly casts one (Prefably
one that uses hardly any mana at all) walk away from you computer and when
you come back your skills up. To stop it just camp. I know some people might
consider this cheating but compared to the Twinks and the Safe Spot campers
this doesn't seem that bad at all. It's not as if it takes any skill raising
your casting levels it's just time consuming.
