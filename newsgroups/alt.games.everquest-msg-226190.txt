A few megs of data per character is not feasible.  450k subscribers.  Most
people have at least a couple alts.  Figure 3 chars per subscriber (which is
probably low).  At 1 meg per character, that is 1.2 terrabytes.  That is not
something that is "easily feasible", especially for a system of EQ's
vintage.

Interesting, but probably more feasible to just go through each quest by
hand, and assign its reward.

Depends on the database.  For a long time, Sony would not do anything that
involved changing the database structure.  Some of the more recent changes
indicate they may have overcome this fear, so perhaps they've done something
that makes the database less scary or fragile.

I wonder if they even have a database, as opposed to a collection of data
files that they manage entirely with their own code?
