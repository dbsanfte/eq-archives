A single hotkey:

(/pet hold)
/pet back off
/pet attack

Then target the mob you want your pet on.  The only reason this won't work
is if the mob you are trying to back your pet off of is at low health (so
your pet acts just like mobs do and goes for the guy about to die), or if
your pet gets hit again before he lands anything on the new target (in which
case, just hit the button again).
