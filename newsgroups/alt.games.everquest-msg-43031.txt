Unfortunately, the world, and the media especially, is quick to look for
someone or soemthing to blame for shit. Playing Everquest? Being "Goth"?
Get real. This society stinks, and most people haven't got a clue how to
parent anymore, or the time to do it.

People would rather blame something else than accept the responsibility
themselves, however, and nothing anyone ever does will change this until
society as a whole gets over its own adolescence and grows up.
