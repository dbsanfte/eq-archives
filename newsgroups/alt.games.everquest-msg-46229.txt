I have never had it break when looting. Granted I only used it to loot my
own corpse. Since I can't fight with it on I have never tried to loot MOB
corpses. When I'm on hide/sneak I usually have a mission to get done and get
the hell out. Such as corpse recovery in BlackBurrow. It's perfect for that.
Ad once you know your way out easily, you can make some decent plat dragging
corpses.

I'm a rogue. I do take advantage.
