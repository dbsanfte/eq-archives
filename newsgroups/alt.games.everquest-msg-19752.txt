Newsreaders can be configured to do this.   He is saying that you should check
your newsreader to make sure it wasn't on by default.

It sounds as if thats not your problem though....  I think you just have a
poor news server at your ISP, which is dumping all articles older than a day
or so.  (to save space).    My current news server saves around 1500
messages... or about a weeks worth of traffic here.   On my previous ISP, it
was common to see over 10,000 posts still on the newsserver, going back a
month and a half or more.
