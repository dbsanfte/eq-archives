Hello,
     Until recently, when I held the mouse cursor over a spell gem or
a buff in my buff window, I'd see text about that spell or buff. It is
the same info that holding down ALT shows, but for just that one item.
However, now I don't get any text at all. The ALT key still displays
information. Everything else works correctly, but just no text. I can
even see the icon on the window select bar change when I move the
cursor over them, so I know EQ is seeing the mouse. Any ideas what
happened and how to fix this? I am runing on XP Proffessional and have
all expansions. It a Geforce II video card, but its been working for a
couple years now. Any helpful hints will be most appreciated?

Ken
