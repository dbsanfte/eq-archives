This thread on being charmed reminds me of two incidents
elsewhere in EQ with charming.  I got charmed by some mob
from a train in Mistmoore.  I killed a group/guildmate as
well as someone from another group.  I was shouting for
people to kill me but everyone just zoned.  I wound up
returning with the train to the middle of the castle and
fortunately got sneak and hide to work as soon as the charm
wore off, then had to ask for directions on how to get out,
as it was my first time in mistmoore, and since we were
going to be fighting by the little pond, didn't bother with
printing the map.

The second charm incident was in Cazic thule in the thrown
room.  First to be charmed was the cleric, then the tank.  I
knew what happened immediately so i used sneak hide while
yelling at the rest of the group to zone, the tank was
charmed.  He killed off most of the party, and I spent the
next several minutes dragging corpses to the zone line.
