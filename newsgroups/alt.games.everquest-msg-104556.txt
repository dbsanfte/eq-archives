No I haven't. Heck, I barely kite the mobs back to my pet, where he tanks
and I finish them off, one by one. It's not mana efficient, and there's lots
of down time, but I enjoy it, so it ain't wrong. (pull with snare, run SoWed
back to pet with timed pauses to cast DoTs, then run mob over the pet who
acts like another DoT, then Shock of Poison or lifetap until it dies)

I'm not a "sit on the edge of my seat" kind of player. :)

The only time I take on more than one mob is when of my guildies joins me,
and I let them pull. But then, I have to change my whole strategy, and keep
allure of death going, lifetaps, and heals for them.

Concerning cleric spell Word of Health- it's the same healings as superior
healing, only it heals everyone in the group that much. Mana cost is about
the same as one CHeal. So if you are the cleric in a group with nothing of
casters, this spell should be really good for you to use in an AoE group.
Word of Vigor is the same as CHeal for Everyone in the group, and is a bit
overpowered for that. The Celestial line is good for low aggro though- any
Word of spell is likely to get your ass jumped pronto.
