Buffed 61+ pets (Mage pet + full summons + Virtue = 6k HP, I was doing this
before I had Girdle though, so 5.8) give you a nice cushion as well - a
PoV golem can't take them from 11% to dead in one shot - so they will
always enrage - giving you time to squeak a quick heal in to save the CH
from landing too late.
