Very true, also... I've had people "treat me as a guard NPC" more than once.
Not sure I'm using it exactly the same way as Annie, but here is how it
usually goes.

A lower level comes running up to you with a red to him mob chasing him,
damaged down to just below 50 percent, then starts /yelling and saying "Help
plz plz".   You kill the mob in about 3 hits, he says "ty" (sometimes) loots
the kill and then runs off.   2 minutes later, the same low level character
runs up again with another red mob beating the hell out of him, once again
just below 50 percent.  This situation repeats every time you're willing to
"save" him.

I'm sorry, but even if I'm not doing anything at the time, I'm not going to
sit around powerleveling you.  (general "you."  Not saying this is what you
were doing.)

These characters also generally carry the same attitude with them to the
higher levels.   "Oops, 6 mobs in that pull.  Nah, don't evac.  We'll just
train the group over there.  They'll kill them all and break up the spawn
for us, or at least weaken them enough that we can win, before they wipe
out."

Between those experiences (and yes, I've had several of each type)... no, I
don't always help people the second they come running up to me, stop, hit
/yell repeatedly.
