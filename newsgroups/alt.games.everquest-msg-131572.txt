OK, considering going back there. I can port to Nexus, then use that to get
to Odus. I'll bind in Shadowhaven and gate back to merchant there? Or should
I bind by druid (non-KOS to me...checked in the past) & gate back there (in
Tox forest)?

And I'm not naked. I kept an old coal black 6AC +1 Mana robe in the bank.
