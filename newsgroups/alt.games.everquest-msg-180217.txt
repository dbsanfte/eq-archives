Dragonns patrol from the outpost, to SF, and then to FM "ledge".

Honestly, people who hunt on the ledges are retards.  The goons ALWAYS
patrol at night, and they ALWAYS kill people.  Hunt 10 inches to the right
and your totally safe....  morons never listen tho.

WW zone is totally safe from goons... lower level mobs too
