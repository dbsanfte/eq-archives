There is a quest in Queynos you can do easily at lev 12 and the reward is a
+3 INT earring.

Near the bank in South Queynos there is a bloke standing near the pond. Talk
to him and he tells you about some girl that went missing in the sewers. The
best way into the sewers for this quest is in the pond. You need to camp the
gelatinous cubes in the sewers, round the corner from the sewer entrance,
waiting for one named Cuburt to spawn. May have to kill about 15 Cuburts
before he drops the item for the quest. Remember to kill everything that
wanders past, except the beggars, while you camp so you increase the spawn
rate of Cuburt.

Took my mage about an hour to get the item. If you have money, you could get
an equivalent earring crafted by a player jeweler for about 15pp.
