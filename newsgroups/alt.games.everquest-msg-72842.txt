Just a few tips...

Level 4 is difficult as an elementalist, mainly because you really get your
power at level 5.  Once you hit 5, things will be MUCH easier.
Until then, a tip or two-

Throughout your single level digit levels, you will be meleeing with your
staff, like it or not.  I bought a level-equal staff at around level 4 or
so, it really helps at this level.

As for cloth, I did find a place where some drops, granted very poor
quality.  It sounds like you're hunting around Camp Station-
look for a little hill right near there with some skellies on it.  Those
skellies drop tattered cloth armor, very poor, but better than nothing and
free.  They even drop it for all slots.  They're not difficult, and staves
get bonuses against them if I remember.  Once you have some cash, you can
buy better cloth from the merchant upstairs.

Always keep yourself buffed.  Always. Keep that self shield and damage buff
up at all times, at least the shield anyway.

Tasks are your friends!  Merchant tasks are hard when you're new at the
game, because they're all fedex type quests, and you'll probably have no
idea how to get to where they're asking.  Guards always ask you to kill a
nearby critter, and I tended to prefer those (except for a certain merchant
quest circle I discovered later, which is quite easy and worthwhile to
do...)

If you can make it to 5, you'll see your power jump dramatically.  Yes,
level 4 does bite :)
