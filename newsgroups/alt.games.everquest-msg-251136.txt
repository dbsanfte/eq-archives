OK, thats how it was back in January too, and most if not all of my 
mage's life.  Knowing SOE, though, I thought it worth asking after so 
long an absence.

Right, pull with big nuke or maybe a DOT... something annoying, anyway. 
  My point wasn't that I'd try and get away with something smaller so 
much as that I wouldn't have to stop and nuke again and again.  With no 
SOW and no snare, stopping with something blue to me on my butt doesn't 
seem like a good option.

And glad of it I'd think.  I've been playing much longer than that, but 
this particular character is younger than the change.

I've been on only a couple LDoN since getting back, they either aren't 
happening as much or mages aren't so desirable for them, at any rate I'm 
not getting the tells for em.

I've grouped in POV, HOH, COD since my return.  COD seems too tight for 
snareless kiting, POV might work... but HOH seems most likely, as its 
got that nice big GY which isn't on the train tracks, but is handy to 
the mobs.  I'm keyed for Torment, but have never been there on any 
character.  POS is a thought, and can I get in to BOT at my level 
without a flag?  Not that I think I can solo there...

None of that would be necessary, though, in fact its probably the 
opposite of what I need, high HP mobs with very high damage output and 
great exp per kill; I'd be happier facing easier mobs for crappier exp 
per kill, as long as its not so bad I end up killing cyans.  I'm not an 
expert at soloing a mage by any means (heck, I'm better at soloing a 
cleric than a mage) and I'm just looking for something worthwhile to do 
while on for short spans or LFG.

Guilds can be quite a pain, depending I suppose on the sort of guild. 
The "family" guilds I've been in all dissolved after a relatively short 
time, perhaps because they didn't really offer people anything as they 
leveled up.  Raid guilds, though, I tend to quit after a while because 
EQ isn't my job, and getting slammed for not wanting to do the same 
raids over and over and over again isn't really something I  want to pay 
money for.

Many of my favorite EQ experiences came last fall with my (then) new 
mage, who didn't join guilds, but cultivated an extensive friends list 
and used that plus the AGE channel (were quite a few AGE on FV) to throw 
together groups from 2 to 6 fairly easily.  Sadly, after my hiatus I 
find few of the people on my friends list are ever online, and most of 
those are 65 and not very interested in running around doing low end (a 
mere 62) stuff with someone they barely remember.  I suspect some quit 
and some are on to new alts...
