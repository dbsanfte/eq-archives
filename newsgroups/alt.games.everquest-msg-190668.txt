What I would do is have the pally just buff and heal the cleric until he is
about level 5 or 6. That should go fast. Then camp at a zone line. Have the
Pally buff up the cleric, then pull and beat down the MOB until it just has
a sliver left. Pally zones, and Cleric finishes off the Mob and gets the
exp.
