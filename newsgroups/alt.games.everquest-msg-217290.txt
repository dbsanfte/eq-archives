Well, since there really is no accounting for taste, suffice it to say we 
disagree on this one. I just prefer the newer models to the block-head-
with-a-face-graphic-pasted-on look. I *was* surprised to see how many 
people preferred the old Iksar models though. Talk about looking like a 
heroin addict...aren't Iksar carnivores?
