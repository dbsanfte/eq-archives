I went to buy ram after Xmas and the kid at best buy told me i should buy
pny because there was a rebate for a total of 144 dollars...Turns out that
the rebate was no longer valid but since the kid told me it was, they had to
give me the rebate in cash on the spot. Walked out of the store with 512Mb
for a little over thirty beans...
