At one point I thought about doing these quests myself.  The problem for me
was that it always seemed like there was at least one piece of a set that
was just a complete pain to get.  It seemed I could spend a lot less time
harvesting cash and buying something better.  I gave up on these awhile ago,
although I still seem to have a boatload of the pieces saved up.  (I just
can't seem to destroy or sell them)
