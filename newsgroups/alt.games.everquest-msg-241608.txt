I saw the post about "Only one character on FV!" by bob, and got curious
again. I haven't been on FV for over a year or two (can't remember). It was
a role-playing server but then it fizzled when languages weren't important
and everyone got common tongue again. Players tried to RP but the larger
group of "dewds" caused much frustration.

Is it any better now? I deleted my char in disgust, so would have to start
anew. Is it worth it? Is there role-playing? Just curious.
