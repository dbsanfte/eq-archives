Hmm... I don't know much about EverQuest II, but I do know how much you
hated going from one place to another in City of Heroes, and I don't
think you're going find travelling any better in EQ2.  Maybe Bob Perez
could compare City of Hero's system of monorails and travel powers with
EverQuest II's travel systems and give you an idea of what to expect.

The fact that the loot in EQ2 is a lot more tangible might however make
the game appealing enough to overcome any problem you might have with
travelling.
