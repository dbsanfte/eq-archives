First of all, I called it "retarded", not "retarted". Retarted would
only be offensive to a high strung baker or pie throwing clown.

Anyways she reacted all self righteously snippy. I gave her the
benefit of the doubt originally. She decided to scrap rather than
admit error. At that point, there's no point in treating an idiotic
post with kid gloves anymore.

She should be thankful the newsgroup let her off easy. She's still
trying to spin herself out of the corner she painted herself into.
