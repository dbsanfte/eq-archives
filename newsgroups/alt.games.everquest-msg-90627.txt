I can take my mage there at lvl 51 and make 400 - 600 an hour IF its late at
nite. I never proven this but it seems like the HGs drop more pp around 4 am
EST. Plus I summon weight reduction bags so I can loot all the FS weapons
and sell them. And yes I can take on more than one at a time. Basically I
let the pet solo and keep the pet well buffed. Usually its non stop killing
for about 30 minutes then time to med up again.
Personally when I just want quick easy cash I do this. I do not like sitting
in GF try to sell stuff, and I still occasionally get XP off of these guys.
Another nice site is the grimling caves in Katta, the gems and runes sell
quite well not to mention what tailors will pay for the ore.
