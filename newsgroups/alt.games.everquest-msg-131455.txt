Would Liberty have been sending her intercepts in the clear anyway?

Also my understanding was that people on board were interpreting
what had been intercepted. So they wouldn't have been sending raw
intercepts in the first place.

The ship had difficulty even sending a distress signal, since the
initial attack targetted all of the radio masts.

This Israeli claim is rather obviously nonsense. Not only do the ships
not look alike, but the Liberty captain had ordered a new flag raised
and a watch kept. So that it would be obvious to anyone that this
was an American ship.

Why would the ship be sharing information with any foreign power in
the first place. If the US chose to share any information gathered
it would be via the USN or CIA.

Either they were lucky or the US wasn't quite so neutral towards
Israel at the time as was claimed.

Would it not have taken specific orders for there not to be a 
firm response?
