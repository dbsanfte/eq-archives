Daaaaamn. Sounds like someone had a bad mage experience. If you're in it 
strictly for the fun of it, a mage is fine. I've played a wizard, and my 
experience was that his nukes were resisted a lot as well. Just don't 
expect to have much luck landing spells on yellow and red con'ing mobs. 
It's not *supposed* to be easy to fight them.

As Shipwreck mentioned, when replying to someone, do so by starting it 
with "/tell <insert other player's name here> ".

Also, I think the classes start coming into their own more like by the 
14th or 15th level. Don't worry too much about grouping until you get to 
like 8 or 10. Before that, everyone is just getting used to playing their 
character class.

As far as travel goes, at early levels you can still go most anywhere you 
might want, you just have to be very careful.

A few things to learn before anything else:

1. Learn the "con" (or consider) system. Know what the various colors 
mean. When you right-click on another creature (even other players) it 
will give you information about how difficult they would be for you to 
fight. The color of that text is the best indicator of what you can 
defeat. White/black is even to your level. Blue or green is lower than 
your level (green mobs won't give you any xp usually). Yellow and red are 
higher than your level with red being potentially *many* levels higher.

2. Learn how to communicate with others. Know what /shout, /ooc, /tell 
and the other commands are used for.

3. Never beg. That's the best way I know to make the worst impression. 
Beggars suck.

4. Most experienced players will be more than happy to answer a question 
or two, provided you ask nicely. However, many don't care for "d00d 
sp33k", so using "please" instead of "plz" and "you" insead of "u" is 
probably a good idea.

Aside from that, there is a wealth of EQ information available on the 
internet.

Hope this helps.
