Don't think in files:
It's like a 3d Shooter: You pick up a weapon, you
can use it - no need to save that info to disk.

If your buddy gives you the weapon, the server
changes player states in memory, and your client
notices you got that weapon, also in memory, then
on the next save its written to server disk.

If you would get a save before your friend does,
and in that instant the server crashes, then,
technically, his save from before the trade might
be restored, while yours gets restored from after the
trade, so you both got the weapon.

Can be completely blocked by the coding, though.
I wouldn't waste any more thoughts on this :)
