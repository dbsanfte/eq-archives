What might be nice would be to add a non-obtrusive text indicator that would
be fairly easy for color-blind people to see but would not clutter things
too much for those who can use the colors.

Another game I play simply adds + or - signs after the mob's name in the
targeting window.  "Orc Pawn" would be even, "Orc Pawn+" would be yellow,
"Orc Pawn++" would be red, "Orc Pawn-" would be blue, "Orc Pawn--" light
blue, and "Orc Pawn---" could be grean.  Maybe go one step farther, and add
"!" if threatening, and "!!" if scowling.  No need to indicate indifferent,
amiable, etc., since you usually don't need to quickly distinguish among
those, so can go ahead and read the text message.
