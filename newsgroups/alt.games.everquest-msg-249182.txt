How many non-power gamers do you really think would support a move to
eliminate or alter PoK?

There are a few die-hards (like yourself) who think that downtime is a
good thing. Based on any number of in-game conversations, I get the
feeling that this sentiment is held by a tiny fraction of EQ players,
many of whom wouldn't really be happy if they got what they thought
they wanted.

Personally, I would love to adventure in GoD. The primary reason I
don't is that it's a pain in the ass to get to.
