Morning Dew is used in cultural smithing (and tailoring I think).  Use of
this vital yet (as you observe) hard to come by component means raising
your skill in your trade, and it means making items that probably sell for
over 10Kpp each

A paw is a princely prize for a quest... but as you can see, amassing 60
morning dews is far from a trivial task, chaining you to the LFay/GFay
zones for days (RL days) on end, constantly slamming the forage button.

The easiest way to ammass items like this in large quantities is to have
lots of other people gather them in small quantities and give them all to
you; the pyramid scheme.  I used to do the same thing with spiderling
silks and Leather Paddings, when I had a smith working on Fine Plate; get
20 newbies each a tailoring kit and a skinning knife, and tell them I'd
pay them 5pp per padding once they had a stack ready.  Back then, this was
an amazing offer... but it meant I could go play, and in a day or two I'd
have a couple backpacks of paddings ready to go, and could put another day
into smithing... and sell the product for a modest profit even after
shelling out like this.  Best thing was, I didn't have to spend a week of
my time killing greenies to get the padding parts!

It seems people have figured this out, and followed the reasoning further,
its not only worth 5pp per to save that time, its worth 20pp or more!
Helps that at the high end, if you can achieve it, your profit margin is
in the thousands instead of in the tens of pp.
