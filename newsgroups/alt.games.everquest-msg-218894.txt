   I learned this in Philosophy class, I think.  But I despaired of being able
to spell it correctly.

     I dunno.  The person we are debating about seems to have very serious
problems telling the difference between a challenge of someone's idea and a
personal attack on them.  It's almost as if you and I were discussing ice cream
(yes, I want some ice cream but don't have any in the fridge!).  I tell you that
I think that chocolate is the best ice cream bar none, period.  You tell me that
while you are sure I might think it a fine flavor, you cannot abide it because
it makes you sprout a prehensile tail every time you eat it (I saw that on the
Discovery Channel.  Just not about you, of course.  I think.).  Then, I get mad,
and call you a sucker of rancid road-kill monkey balls because it is obvious to
ME that chocolate is the best flavor.  This response makes no sense, of course,
but I really feel that is what was going on here. And I have seen others on the
newsgroup that seem to make similar odd leaps in logic.

  I didn't.  Especially since Teckla himself said he felt it was a case of "Tit
for tat".  This implies to me that he felt it was a fair response under the
circumstances.  Someone counters with an idea you don't like?  They suck monkey
balls.  QED.

     /snicker.  Aw.... you're sweet.
