The implication is always that something evolves to fit the enviroment
better, so it is an improvement, even if it is an sea creature coming
out the sea to become a mammal and then going back to the sea to
become a whale.  

We have to keep in mind that the environment also changes and
sometimes the simpler form has a better fit, if for no other reason
than it has an easier time adapting to the changed environment. 

Since this in an EQ board, think of the magician that hadn't focussed
on pet canni yet.  He is in some ways better off than the magicians
who optimized themselves for pet cani and got nerfed.  The environment
changed and all magician's need to adapt (evolve) to the change or go
on the shelf.
