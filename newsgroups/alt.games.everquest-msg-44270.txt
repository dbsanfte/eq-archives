But -why- is the exp good?  Because there are always lots of level
appropriate mobs, good hunting grounds for a variety of techniques,
and (drum roll) you get more exp for a kill of that level than you
would in a zone with no exp bonus.

Course I could be wrong about the bonus, and even if I'm
right but they decided to remove it tomorrow it would -still-
be a kick asterisk zone.
