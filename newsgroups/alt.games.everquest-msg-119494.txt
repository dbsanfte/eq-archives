I'll share this:  exploiting the guards can lead to disciplinary action
against your account.

For what its worth, they regard your charmed mob just like any other
pet, as a reflection of your status with them.  So if you are not KOS
you can bring your normally KOS mob near guards so long as it is charmed
and they won't mind.  Not sure what would happen if you charmed while
they were fighting but I would think both NPCs would stop the fight, but
that's just a guess.

This isn't though: exploiting the guards can lead to disciplinary action
against your account.
