If you were human, and a follower of Rodcet Nife, you could do the Shining
Star of Light quest..magic 1hb 6/28, procs Cleanse.  Being a dwarf, however,
you'd have to spend so much time building faction in both Rivervale AND at
the Temple of Life in Qeynos to be allowed to complete it, that you'd be
better off trying for something else.
