Unfortunately Chloroplast adds only 10 hp/tick regeneration. However, 
pre-nerfed Rage also added regeneration, somewhere around 30 point per 
tick

Actually the only thing that the skill in defense does is add armor 
class. And both warrior and shaman were capped at 200 in it :)
Dual wield at that point was somewhat offset by the two handed weapon of 
the shaman. The fact that dual wielded yaks do more damage than single 
Gatorsmash is offset by the shaman haste being a bit superior to the 
FBSS. So the advantages of the warrior were hitpoints, about 60% chance 
to double attack (if I remember the numbers right).
