Up to level 16, it's entirely possible to solo your way through the
game. This is easily the most boring way to play EverQuest. Without
player interaction, it's just a bad version of Diablo.

As an experiment, go into Paludal Caverns and type /ooc Warrior 16
LFG. While I can't promise that the grouping at that level is going to
net you the most sterling examples of the EverQuest community, it will
at least give you some idea of what most of the game is about. In a
few levels (about level 24 my first time around,) you're not going to
be able to survive soloing anyway. Warriors are particularly bad at
it.

As for death not being the end, I suspect you will appreciate that
more a few months down the road, when you start to become attached to
your character and the time you've invested in him.

Running around and killing things *is* a central activity in
EverQuest, but there's a lot more to it than that.
