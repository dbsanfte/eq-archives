I noticed that too. Most chat takes place in group chat and guild
chat, which passerbys don't see. Hardly anyone uses /say except to ask
someone to group.

People seemed more friendly after getting off the IoR though. Why
bother making friends with a character that may be rerolled, deleted,
or acct cancelled? By the time they get to Qeynos, chances are pretty
good that the person is sticking with it, and you see alot of the same
names every day.

As for the chat window, I prefer having all chat in one window and
game messages in another (with fight messages turned off). Just my
personal preference tho.

You get the free character stat, bio, and paperdoll page. If you want
to host screenshots, you could always do that on your own page for
free.
