No, because the very first "open raid" of any magnitude I ever saw happened
within the past month.  Rodcet Nife wasn't a very "open" server.

And yes, because I've done all that content and am very familiar with the
changes, as they had a major impact on raiding guilds.

So?  From what I hear, other servers have had open flagging raids since long
before the changes were put in place.  Most of the zones those flags
originally gave access to have long been opened up to everyone of the
requisite level.  The flags themselves have minimal rewards unless you have
the whole set.  If you can get the whole set through only "open raids"... 
more power to ya, and you should join a raiding guild because you obviously
have the time to do so.  =P

No, it isn't easier.  It's easier to get "some flags", but it isn't easier
to "progress".  Elementals/Time were designed, even after the backflagging
changes, to provide some definite roadblocks that would require dedicated
cooperation to pass.  Even getting "just" the Time flag requires 36
"hardcore" (mentality, not necessarily gear), and probably more like 50 of
the people that would be on your average "open raid".  Actually getting the
flags for the elementals, doing it the "easy" way, still requires the
killing of the four gods (ironically, a far harder thing to accomplish than
to get elemental access the old "hard" way).

I'm not sure I comprehend what you're saying here.  If you'll re-word, I'll
gladly respond.  I don't wanna go off on a tangent that isn't actually what
you intended to say though.

Now *that* is a far more likely scenario, and shows a comprehension of the
corporate world.  =)
