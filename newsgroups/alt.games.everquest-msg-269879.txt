>Nobody even dreamed of charging a monthly fee for a game until EQ1 came out. 

Other than the people making Ultima Online, Gemstone, Dragonquest,
Meridian 59, that even earlier one which was on that online service
that totally tanked...you know what I mean...

It amazes me how clueless people are about the history of their own

(Some of the above may have charged HOURLY fees, instead. I know UO
was monthly. But all were "pay to play".)
