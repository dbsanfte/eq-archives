http://www.eqdiva.com/  loads of bard specific info to get you going, also
they've just added a nice tuo0ch to the game right click and hold down the
button over your spell/song icon for a somewhat decent explanation of what
it does.

She may have asked you for 4 to hand in and you would have needed to hand
them in not stacked, can't recall the quest off-hand.. as a note, stock up
on those silks as they are always worth good money (3pp or so) to other
players who make armor from them.

This is covered ont he eqdiva's website as well, but a brief rundown,
instruments will boost your song effects, example is a "lute" is a 2% boost
to some songs, a "combine lute" is a 2.2% boost. So there are various
upgrades for instruments, peek at eqdiva for better info (just woke up
myself lol)

Groups are effective from lvl 1 but most people skip on them in th beginning
since lvl 1-10 can be done in a few hours once you get the hang of the game
(having alternate characters is a huge part of the addiction!). As for
losing your group, select one of your group members and type /follow to
auto-follow them around.

Generally if your not begging for a buff and someone just does a run by
buffing you don't need to worry yourself over donating coin to them as you
didn't ask for it in the first place, course a thankyou is always nice but
as you said alot of people litterally will run up buff you and take off like
every bixie in Norrath has them on radar before you get a chance to thank
them, i tend to "/tell name Thankyou!"  if I can to let them know i do
appreciate it and I know from both sides of the coin that is all most people
expect.

Trades are very useful now, why when i was a young dark elf the only trades
that were worth it were jewel craft and alchemy... but sony woke up and made
every trade very viable. http://www.eqtraders.com/learn.htm however it may
be a while before you can master a trade since they do cost a fair bit of
money and take up some time.

and a few other links which may be of help =)
