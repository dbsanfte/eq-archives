Nah. The crafted armor quests are a whole different type of PITA, but
it's not EverCamp. All of the items you need are fairly common drops off
the mobs that have them. The majority of them I got on the first kill.
The longest among them were the aviak charm (a bit more of an uncommon
drop, but you'll see quite a few in an hour if you're pulling them
steadily.) the griffon eye (which can come quick, or after a LOT of
griffs, but still not bad) and the optic nerves. (Though you'll still
likely get one within the first five evil eyes. I have a bunch in the
bank laying around if you're on Xev and need one.)
  The pain in the butt is running all over the world to hunt these mobs,
get the drops, run all over looking to buy the gawd awful expensive
gems, and running all the way to SK every time to exchange them for the
piece. That's a pain in the butt.
  The Permafrost, Sol A, and Runneye are probably the hardest to get to
at a reasonable level. I didn't get the permafrost piece until well into
my 40's and then only because I happened to be there for a Vox raid.
  You want your first "rip your hair out and bleed from the ass" camp?
Go for your j-boots. Yeah, you'll hear stories of people who were in and
out in under an hour. But it doesn't happen. We were there for DAYS!!!!
(Still bleeding from the brain from that fucking camp. grrrrrrr.)
