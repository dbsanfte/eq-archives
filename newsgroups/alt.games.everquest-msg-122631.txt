FWIW, you might not want to do that if you get bad enough faction with
corrupt Qeynos guards.  Lt. Dagarok, a level 50ish SK, sits RIGHT
outside the monk guild, behind a wall where it isn't convenient to see
him.

First time I discovered I was KOS to the corrupt guards, I was showing
a buddy of mine where the monk guild in Qeynos was.

He hit me once.

Monks are easy to avoid, so I wouldn't worry about the faction.  Only
two wanders in the open you got to worry about around Qeynos.  The
level 1 guy in the newbie area, and Konim Whathisname in Qeynos Hills.
He's in his teens, but sticks near the path and has a fairly small
aggro radius, IIRC.
