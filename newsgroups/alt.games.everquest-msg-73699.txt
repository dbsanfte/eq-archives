Well to be honest her gear is fine for her level,  in fact a year ago it
would have been very good for her level :)  Best advice i can give is for
her to forget about her gear and level some more.  Once she is 46+, and even
more so 50+ her gear will come gradually just by raiding with your guild.
(99% of the time the best gear is nodrop anyway)  However here is a few
things she can do if she wishes to improve anyway:

1.  Do the Acumen Mask quest and drop the sheer bone mask (easy for a 40
wizard to do solo) spoiler found at www.graffe.com

2.  Do Phenocrysts Focus quest and drop the Stein (Keep the stien for Trak
raids) This will require guild help.  1 group of low-mid 50's will manage
the last part easy, the rest can be done solo. Spoiler also at the above
mentioned site.

3.  If int is her main concern right now,  Try to get a golden Bracer and/or
a golden Chitin Bracer. You can either Camp these or buy them relatively
cheaply.  If her int is maxed then buy a Blue Diamond Bracer instead.  (Nice
Mana and wonderul resists)

The rest she just needs to be higher level for really.  Carmine stuff from
the Plane of Fear is pretty easy to get if your guild does it regularly,
then of course you have the Velious quest armour once she is 50+ and hunting
in Kael/Thurg/NToV.  You didnt say what her INT was at though.  If you can
post back with her current INT status there is plenty of +mana and +resist
gear i can reccomend...all of which is buyable pretty cheaply,  of course
she will only do that if her int is high enough.
