Ok, now I'm totally down with you using Usenet to spread your messages of
hatred and all.  But even the stupidest of hatemongers who is technically savvy
enough to fire up a computer, get access to usenet, and fire off a post must
*surely* have been able to come up with a better cross section of newsgroups to
target for antisemitism than this!
I mean, seriously..........
Newsgroups:
misc.writing, alt.games.everquest, rec.martial-arts, rec.sport.golf,
alt.cellular.nokia

Can *anyone* come up with a rationale as to how somebody would pick this
particular mix? It's not a group in tight alphabetical order, so I don't think
it's a spambot.  Authors, online gamers, karate enthusiasts, golfers and cell
phone users?
WTF?
