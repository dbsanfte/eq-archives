Good analysis overall, just want to add a few points.

There are various other effects of being on a mount.  As Richard
mentions, you don't get sitting HP regen, which can be an issue.
You also can't stop casting a spell; you can move to interrupt it,
but it takes the full casting time, whereas off a mount you can
use /stopcast (or there's also a key-binding for it) to stop the
cast and let you start casting something else immediately.  And
some skills don't work while mounted, such as Forage, and Bind
Wounds.

Nevertheless, I ended up getting a mount for my Druid.  As you say,
it's not great for kiting, and for travel speed I prefer my own SOW
or SOE (or, when necessary, the LDON indoor Spirit of Shrew).  What
the mount lets me do is med while being beat on.  So I can throw
some dots on a mob, and some damage shields on myself, and then sit
on my pony WITHOUT turning on my attack (indeed, my primary slot has
my enhanced DOT focus instead of a weapon) and I med the whole time.
This obviously works best against mobs that don't turn me into paste
too quickly. :-)  But an additional feature of being mounted is that
I find my spells are less likely to be interrupted, perhaps because
damage tends not to push me back as much.  I know there are some
changes in the works for Channelling, so this tactic might get
nerfed, but for now I can usually get an occasional heal spell off.
(Or I two-box with a cleric to handle the healing duties.)

A related bonus is that it's easier to mem spells in melee.  Damage
tends to interrupt memming, but at least I'm not being forced to
"stand up", so if I time it right I can usually mem a spell or even
two between hits.
