I don't know you, or anyone else's, computer skills in this
newsgroup. So I asked someone whose computer skills I do know about.
He said an emulation of a PC on a Cray would depend on how it was
done. Its not an either/or situation. If the company hiring someone
to do it hired a mediocre programmer and that person did it in C++,
it would be slower on the Cray, depending on the Cray. If the
programmer hired was top-notch, and did it in native machine
language, the emulation on the Cray would be faster than the speed
the PC ran.

So I was almost correct.
