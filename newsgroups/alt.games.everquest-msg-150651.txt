Hmmm, I've read their Warrior ones and I DON'T agree with them.
They Generally suggest spreading out Stats and often concentrate on strength
.
E.g. Dark Elf says 25 to strength whereas I would say 10 to str 15 to
stamina (this is not what I did) and only suggest 10 to strength due to the
weight issues I am having atm.

I pretty much agree with them on the Rogue halfling stats, 25 to strength
and 5 to stamina. Strength makes a very small difference to damage but as
Damage is the Rogues forte you may as well get every bonus you can.
