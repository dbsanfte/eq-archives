I have a few ideas.

Yes but very _very_ few warriors are able to get enough gear of the quality
needed to reach that far. 16-1700 seems pretty reachable for a warrior in a
top-end guild.

Hey at least CH would start to be less broken! :)

Perhaps the AoW would fall more regularly? :)

I think Epic Armours will probably be more concerned with looks, a kind of
badge-of-honour type things. I think they'll also be reachable by the
smaller guilds who have no chance of getting the numbers needed to crack
NToV. I doubt there will be much in the way of raw power upgrades for people
in full NToV/PoM/VeliousUber gear and what little there is will be locked
away in the new uberguild playground zone.
That is unless they change the combat system - maybe introduce the defence
tables that Furor proposed. That would create some leeway for tougher mobs
and more equipment upgrades without further over-extending the borderline
ridiculous high-end encounter system that all ready exists.
