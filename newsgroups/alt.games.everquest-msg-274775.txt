I have two craftsman, a lv 10 and a lv 15, and i noticed that their 
tradeskill powers were different. Some items seem to be missing from the 
lv 10 'spellbook'. I don't mean recipes, i mean the tradeskill powers.

Will my lv 10 craftsman get them at lv 11 or is he somehow bugged? 
Should i petition, or would the gm just suggest posting it on the devs' 
page, or starting a new character, neither of which would be much fun?

Thanks for you time,

Rolph the lv10 crippled craftsman
