Humm :

1) Special move combo left, left, hold, right + return !
You have made something new !

2) Reaction test. Show (for e.g.) a thermometer on screen when the
temperature hits the melting point of gold hit return .. ... .... .....
....... <Return>
You have made something new !

3) Speed test : Hit the space bar to simulate beating the armour into
shape. You MUST beat the armour 100 times before it cools. Start now !
You have made something new !

4) Mouse waggles like in B&W ?

5) A series of "golf game" style "power bars" for measuring ingrediens ?

6) A papa rappa "sing along" with the blessing test ?

7) A combination of all of the above that ends up becomming some mad sub
game ?
