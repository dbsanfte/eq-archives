Zymyool try to kick her cat it chase him up a tre:

You're going to get two kinds of responses to this question.  One will come
from stat rogues who say rogues aren't tanks and put everything into str.  
The other will come from ac/hp rogues who say dead rogues do no damage, put
everything into sta.

Which of those answers is correct is debatable (although I'm an ac/hp rogue
myself), but you've got yourself a nice compromise there.  I'd stick with
it.
