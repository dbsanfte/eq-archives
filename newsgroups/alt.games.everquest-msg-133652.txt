I can't think of any logs that would prove it anyway. Unless someone was
running ShowEQ, There's no real way of proving it.

The levels in question were a 50th Warrior and a 45th Druid.
The Druid always "seemed" to get far more exp from me pulling Stone Gazer
Cockatrice (green and for the most part, zero exp for the Warrior) then if I
pulled Drolvargs, blue to both.
If I ever get around to it I'll try it with a 38th Wizard I have. Start in
OT (blue mobs to Wiz but green to the 52nd level Pwr Lvl's) and then move to
DL where I'll only pull blues and light blues to my main...If I start with
the beginning of a bubble, no blue showing, use /time and screen shots to
mark points and then see how many mobs it took to get that bubble of
Yellow...oh ffs, I really don't have that much spare time.

You're probably right, if it did work this way then why aren't more people
using the towing technique (except that in EQ you gain skills thru use and
not just thru skill points given, as in DAoC where the towing technique is
very popular) I'm not conceding tho' you'll have to prove it to me :ï¿½P
