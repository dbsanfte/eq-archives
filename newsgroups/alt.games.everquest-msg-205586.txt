While DoTs are not raid tools, every little bit helps, and the dots stack.
(Your dots stack. My dots go bouncy bouncy.., but hey we debuffed str 15
points!)

Depending on the Enchanter/Shaman mix, I've had shamans hasting the pets and
stuff when I couldn't keep the  mana to haste everything.. of course an
epic'd Enchanter should have no such trouble getting some haste on everyone
that asks.

At least 5 raids I've been on (with other guilds) had every shaman in the
raid throw slow on pull, hoping at least one would stick. Waste of mana?
Perhaps, but it makes it much more likely that the target gets slowed. One
raid had the enchanters slowing too. I got to be the 'stuck haste' for 11
seconds one time (maybe longer... I died at 12 seconds :P)

I'd say that you may be in the boat I was: Hmm, ok he can haste for free
better than I can with mana, I don't have KEI, nothing to CC or Charm. I
can't DoT because it doesn't stack. Shaman is slowing. He's tashing. I guess
I can str debuff. <pop, pop>
Ok, let's pull out them big old enchanter nukes. (Nyuk Nyuk Nyuk).
My whole role in one raid was: C2 anyone that gets rezzed till the main
Enchanter gets around to KEI, Nuke, and /camp with the clerics so there's
someone to buff mana regen on rez. And that was with one other enchanter on
the raid.
