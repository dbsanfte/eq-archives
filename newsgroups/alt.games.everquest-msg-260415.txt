I bought a LG Flatron L1710B, and was so pleased with it I bought a 
second one straight away. 17", good contrast, and a more than fast 
enough refresh rate for games. The only problem I can see with them is 
that there definitely is a brightness gradient from the bottom to the 
top of the screen. Otherwise, they are great.
