"I agree... but I still think you should say "Sorry, I'm too busy to rez
you." Running around with /AFK and /anon (or /roleplay) seems rather
cowardly... or at least it's like you're evading something that cannot
really harm you."

That states that I think that the action is cowardly, not the person. If I
wanted to say you were a coward, I would word it like this...

"...Running around with /AFK and /anon (or /roleplay) makes you nothing but
a coward."
