That makes no sense at all.

If you are writing a new math curriculum for the 8th grade why would you 
only want to talk to people who got A+, finished their homework as it 
was being assigned, and spent 40 out of the 60 minutes in class bored to 
tears?

Sure they've got something to shed on the topic...

But wouldn't you be just as interested in the people who were getting 
Fs, couldn't complete their homework if they had six months to stare at 
it, and spent 40 out of 60 minutes in class wondering what the hell the 
teacher was talking about...

I would be. And in everybody else in between too.

Suggesting that people who haven't mastered the content have nothing to 
say about it is both ignorant and arrogant.
