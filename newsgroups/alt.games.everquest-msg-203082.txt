What a fucking moron.  No one wants the clarity line done away with,
the proponents of the high level group buff fix simply wanted high
level buffs restricted to appropriate leveled people.  This to undue
some of the deleterious effects that buffs like HoV/Aego/KEI/BoT9 had
on the low end game, and players.>>>>
