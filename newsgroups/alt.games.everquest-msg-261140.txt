Um, OK, if you say so. If 170 AAs and in a Guild that has just defeated 
Saryn for the first time and hasn't beaten RZ yet classifies me as a God, 
then so be it. What do I become once I reach Time or get into Kod'Taz?

I thought I was just an average casual gamer. It took me 3 years to get to 
65, and a further year for the 170 AAs. The only reason I'mm 66 is because I 
took a decision to get my 65 XP to 99.9% a while back.
