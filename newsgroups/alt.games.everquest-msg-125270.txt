You mean it lasts the same amount of time?  Crap.  Never mind.

To be honest, I haven't come a cross a 50+ druid spell worth the time and
plat to buy, with the exception of Superior Heal.  Upheaval may be good for
faction work, but it looks to me like something who's sole purpose is to get
the druid killed by honking off every mob the party's fighting.  Maybe I'm
wrong ... been married long enough to know that that's usually the case.
