I took my 51 warrior into Najena this morning for a litle while to camp
up a few items to mildly twink up my naked necro a bit. Did Rathyl a
couple times (needed the key anyway) and the chick who drops Najena's
key, then Najena once for a robe. Then I decided that maybe I should get
a necro usable magic weapon for him, and I'd ready about the bloodclaw
stilleto. I had some more time and figured, "why not?". Went up to the
spider area. No Widomistress up. Hmmmm. Ok, so I kill all the spiders.
And I wait. And I kill all the spiders. And I wait.
  Finally, a spider spawns, and then the back spawn spot has a DE female
standing there. The Widowmistress at last! Yippee!!!!!!  I attack with
great delight. THis mob is in the mid thirties, and I'm over fifty.
Granted, I'm solo so I have no buffs and such, but I've got passing fair
gear and more than 2K Hit Points.
  So..........
After I contact the cleric to come rez me, I get her assitance to kill
this bitch and I get my dagger. Man, I just want to warn you. If you're
thinking of camping this witch, pack a lunch and a flashlight. She had a
boatload of xp for a lousy low/mid thirtysomething mob, that dagger can
really do a number on you, and the poison she injects you with is doing
some really fucked up levels of damage. Killed me in about two minutes.
Be safe out there.
