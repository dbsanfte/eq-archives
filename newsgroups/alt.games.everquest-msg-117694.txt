Sorry, I should have worded that better.  Bards are the only class
that can both track a live person, and locate corpse of a formally
live person.  Due to a bug, under certain conditions, all trackers can
track a corpse.
The workaround is to have nothing targeted and cast the locate corpse
spell.  It will locate the nearest corpse.  If it's not the corpse you
want, move further away from that corpse, clear target, repeat.  This
can be pretty useless in a place where people leave corpses stacked at
the zone, hoping for a drive-by rez, but in a spot like PoG can save a
LOT of time looking for lost corpse.
