Having a plan still wont make code magically change or appear.  Plans dont
always go to plan, you know.

Of course you have beta inside infos on SoE's programmers, there deadlines,
there techniques, my bad.

People complain if a patch comes at all.
People complain if the patch doesnt do everything they want.
People complain even about the good changes.
People complain if a patch is released buggy.
People complain if a patch is released late.
People complain etc etc.

Get in the fuckin real world, shit happens, stop complaining.  Game is more
like Everwhine than Everquest now.

Oh nos patch is late, must mean their programmers are all inept morons....
