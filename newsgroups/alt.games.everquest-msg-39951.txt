I agree, and usually know it's the case.  However I've logged in early
in the morning and seen a couple of hundred more than normal, and found
out later in game "it's some national French holiday, and folks are home."
I ended up logging on my rogue instead of my druid and got into a French
Vox raid.  Without that single incident (which is completely anecdotal and
not normally true), I'd agree more vigorously.

Again, true.  I just think that it's also bad form to take away something
that the folks that play the game and are happy with.  I honestly don't
think
they'd piss anybody off by leaving the numbers up ("What's with making
me see all those numbers before login? DAMN YOU VI!!!" :-)  ), but
this conversation shows the effect of the other way around.  It'd be like
starting the NFL season this year and informing the fans that all the
yardlines except the endzones have had their numbers removed.  You
don't in any shape form or fashion NEED the numbers on the yardline
to know the ball has moved 10 yards or that a team scored a touchdown,
but the numbers are something the fans (and announcers :-)  ) are used
to.  Why piss off/upset/annoy a bit of the fanbase for no good reason?

That's always annoyed me.  It's a game, and as much as I love it, the
numbers will (eventually) drop.  It's inevitable.  6 years from now I
doubt Smed will be saying "We have 50,000 players around the world!"
I'm glad for the company and their numbers...many subscribers means they
keep servers up and let me play.  But crowing about the numbers like
that (as opposed to specific server numbers) just seems a bit juvenile.
