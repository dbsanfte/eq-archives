As part of the 5th anniversary celebration by Sony, they've made it so
that occasionally, "fabled" versions of some old world monsters pop
instead of the normal ones (e.g. The Fabled Frenzied Ghoul). These mobs
/con the same level as their original ones, but hit like trucks. The
Fabled Frenzied Ghoul doubles 1300s and flurries. Their drops are also
"fabled" as well:

Fabled Flowing Black Silk Sash 
MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM NO DROP
Slot: WAIST
AC: 14
STR: +10 DEX: +10 STA: +10 HP: +65 MANA: +50 ENDUR: +50
SV FIRE: +5 SV DISEASE: +5 SV COLD: +5 SV POISON: +5
Haste: +36%
WT: 0.1 Size: SMALL
Class: ALL
Race: ALL
Slot 1, Type 7

Overall, risk vs. reward, these mobs aren't worth killing for their
drops, as any normal groups that could kill one wouldn't see these
items as upgrades. From what I've seen ingame, people are lining up to
kill these mobs just to outfit twinks.
