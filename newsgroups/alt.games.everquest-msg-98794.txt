I haven't had a chance to check out the new chat channels in the game, but
it seems to have a lot of potential.  I suppose that it will just take time
for the word to spread on each server on which commonly used chat channels
are used for what.

I was also hoping that these channels could be used to find other players to
group with.  Maybe LFG channels for various level ranges.  That way you
could broadcast your level and class and zone you are in, or if you are
looking to collect a group for a specific purpose you could advertise those
details as well.  It seems that it would be a great way to find others who
are looking, without running from zone to zone, hoping your friends are on,
or guildmates are nearby.

Do you think this would work?  What would be the best way to go about
getting these channels started so that people would know they are available
and how to use them?   I was thinking something really basic like LFG15,
LFG20, LFG25 etc... Then you could join the two lists closest to your level.
This would be simple and easy to remember.

What do you think?  Suggestions??
