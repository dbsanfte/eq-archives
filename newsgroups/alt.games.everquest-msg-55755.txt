If your address or phone number changed, EVEN A LITTLE since before your
card expired that might be the problem.

Whether it is or not, I don't know.  What I do know is that a lot of the
time cards are denied elsewhere because you didn't enter the information
exactly like it is listed at your credit card company.

If my credit card was under Dan Harmon and I put my name Daniel Harmon, it
would be denied.  If my area code was changed to 654 but it used to be 321
and the credit card company did not change it, I would have to use what my
CREDIT CARD company thinks it is, even if it is wrong.
