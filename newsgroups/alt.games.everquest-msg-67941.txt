I thought it'd be the fact that you look like a pink panda to anyone
that zones in after you bear form :p
Then again, the rat form bug kinda makes up for some of the bear form
shortcomings, doesn't it?

I put wolf form to good use last night. Wanted to check a friend's
face to see if it'd accidentally changed, but his helm graphic refused
to go away. Wolf forming him took care of that problem (but not the
problem that he's decided to quit due to certain uberguild woes :(  ).
