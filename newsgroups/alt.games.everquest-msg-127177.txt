I bet you do. I bet I will, too. :P

I have finally started focusing on one character. Having a 19 chanter, 31 
druid, and a 35 monk, I chose the (at the time of the decision, level 22) 
monk and I have not looked back. The druid will get up to 34, if only for 
the PLing ability for my guild and the porting ability. He will also be my 
tradeskiller, since he has a 180+ wis. The monk, though, sees all my time 
and money now. He will kill a dragon. He will see the upper end zones. He 
will pull on a raid. All of these things I have decided, and I fully intend 
to follow up. :)
