Friends and I did a (serious) treatment on a MMO game... We've got a 300 
page design document somewhere on someone's harddrive, before we decided 
  that we really did not have the ability to sell it to a publisher.

Part of our model included:
a) Heavily going after the farm-to-ebay crowd.
b) In game purchases of equipment for real dollars. We even consulted a 
lawyer about the issues of things like:
 >Virtual property lawsuits due to us selling them the sword, then 
banning them when they violated our AUP.
 >Liability due to hardware/software failure, given that we had (by 
nature) assigned a value to everything in real dollars.

We had 3 basic 'tiers' of gear, and level limits on things, and a few 
other wrinkles I've never seen mentioned (which I won't mention cause 
you never know...):
We intended people could be acceptably equiped in looted or vendor 
purchased gear from the levels they were fighting on. The extra was 
'vendor fodder', needed to generate money into the economy to pay for 
expendables. That was tier 1. Most expendables were tier 1 as well. We 
were going to try to make it where everyone would want expendables 
(food, drink, potions, ammo, throwable weapons, 'trinkets' (Like a 
charged right click from inventory item.), 'upkeep' and repair kits, 
spell components, etc. Expendables were the backbone of the crafting 
abilities, where most of that type of craftables would take storebought 
ingrediants and could then be turned into expendables. You could also 
vendor purchase some expendables, at a significant markup from component 
price to encourage people to use crafters, and try to give crafters some 
room to play in money wise.

Tier 2 were things like rare drops on common spawns, rare (nothing like 
once a week though) spawns that dropped nice items,  the stuff people 
farm a lot for a game's bazaar.  Nice things to have, but not the best. 
This is what the well dressed adventurer is wearing. Most non expendable 
crafted gear would fall into the catagory too. Buyable for real money 
items ranged from the bottom to the top of tier 2. Also there were some 
expendables that fell into tier 2, almost always high end craftables 
(think top of the line arrows, potions of gate, stuff like that).

Tier 3 was going to be your raid force gear, or hard work quest gear.
Most items in Tier 3 would be... closest idea is attunable/soulbound 
from WoW (We called it Spirit Linked and Spirit Seared I think... I may 
be wrong... essentially these items could be sold and used at a tier 2 
level until spirit linked or seared. Linking could be undone with some 
work, seared could not, but made the item even better than spirit linked)

Our bazaar/auction/pc vendor type thing was going to be restricted to 
expendables and dropped crafting ingrediants... I think we were calling 
it the commodities market in the DD. You want to sell your sword of 
uberness +4, +6 against noobs, you have to do it in person.

Iirc our plan called for items sold for cash to be only tradeable within 
an account. hand me down it to another character of yours, fine. Or you 
could sell it back to us for credit towards other items (though buyback 
we were figuring was going to be 30%-40%). You could even spend that 
credit back into playtime (at another 2:1 or something.). Note that the 
'pass to another character on the account' wasn't all that bad, because 
  bought items were... well essentially (though our system didn't work 
quite that way) if you bought a new sword for your 25th level wood elf 
warrior, you have a warrior only min level 25 sword (assuming you bought 
the best). You don't give it to your Woodelf ranger, he can't use it, 
even at 25th level.
That way if you decide Wood elves make lousy warriors, you want a troll, 
you can hand him all your gear (except spirit seared).
