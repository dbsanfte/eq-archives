	Yes.

	Any half-assed automatic testing program would have revealed
that the new AA calculations were broken.  The test harness calls the
AA calculation routines and compares the output to the expected.  That
wasn't done, or they'd have known right away it was broken.

	I understand how subtle playability bugs or complex interactions
between game events and player input aren't necessarily testable, but
"level 10 AA should give +30% to skill foo.  Does it?" is an easy condition
to test for.  

>That's absurd. 

	Yes, it is.  That trivially verifiable conditions aren't even
checked before rollout is simple bad practice.  It's like the stupid 
guild hall door bug.  That should never reappear because it should be 
part of the automatic test harness every rev goes through as part of
routine QA.  Of course, there IS no QA at Sony.  

	Look, after 9 years these guys should have an automatic test suite
1 million lines long.  Every time they find a bug like the door bug there
should be a new test case added - "Input click to start-zoning-function.  
Is zoning routine called?" - but they don't do that, or trivial bugs wouldn't
reappear.   This isn't a black art.  How do you think they verify Oracle,
for instance?

	They "go in without any trouble at all" by accident, rather than
because they were verified.  Maybe we're in a semantic conflict.  "Software
testing" doesn't mean exhaustively verifying every possible combination of
inputs and outputs.  It means running the program through a test harness
that contains test cases for combinations it's possible to test for,
test cases for known bugs that should remain fixed, and some "corner
cases" - extreme combinations.  If a developer finds and fixes a stuck
in the geometry bug she should create a test case that verifies that bug
is fixed and add it to the test harness.  And etc.

	The result is a constant if slow improvement in software quality.
As opposed to "well the door's broken again good thing we left in the
workaround to the patch to the fix so we can ignore it".
