In that kind of a group, with a good bard puller/CC that lets you take
mobs one at a time, you are gonna be pretty useless.

Mal-x and cripple seems useless in LDoN (maybe not in 65 hard)
although I'll mem malo before pulling the target in an assassinate.
Slow is situational but you might want to consider memming a lower
level slow in that situation. Try to slow once and if it's resisted
don't worry about it and just go into DPS mode. You're still saving
the cleric mana over the long run. 

Other than that, just go into DPS mode. Make sure your pet has HoS
(for the str buff), haste and 2 weapons and even the 55 pet can put
out some DPS. 

Buy Anathema (lvl 54?) if you haven't got it and get a Coldain bracer.
It's a nice fast DoT (with a long ass recast time) and the bracer will
get average damage up to 300 per tick. 

Use Torrent of Poison (lvl 54 I think) if you don't have to worry
about mezzed mobs close. Even with resists it's argueably the best way
you have of dealing quick damage. 

I never liked our nukes, but others do. Play around with the different
damage spells and see what fits your style. You won't be threatening
any DPS classes but it's respectable.

In normal adventures, Slow isn't godlike (like it is in PoP), at least
with a good bard pulling singles. Even at 65 I don't feel all that
useful in that kind of a group. It just depends on the kind of a group
you have. Do some tank-mez groups instead and you'll suddenly feel a
lot more useful (plus they're a lot more fun imo <g>). Overall, shaman
certainly isn't a required class there (but neither is anyone else)
and often you probably aren't even the best slowing class for a
particular group. Then again, what other class can switch from healer
to (off)tank to crowd control to (decent DPS) at a moments notice. For
me, LDoN is a lot of fun as a shaman.
