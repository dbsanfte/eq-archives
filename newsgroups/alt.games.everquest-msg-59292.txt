In Velks an enchanter is generally optional unless you're fighting
Kobolds.  Especially one who doen't haste the tanks.  It's one of the
few places where you can kill stuff fast enough to not need CC if you
are all melee.  I've seen 5 melee and a bard do quite well there, and
with bards much lower level then myself.  I'm sure that 5 melee and a
shaman is even more effective.
