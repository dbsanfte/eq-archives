    Vendor charge. Remember what this system is intended to do: make sure a
macro bot can't sit beside a vendor and make a profit. So as long as the
sell price of your product is less than the combined buy price of the
components, the macro person is hosed. Note also that nowhere did it say
that the sell price of tradeskill items would now be equal to the combined
buy price, only that it will never be higher. So an item that costs 500 pp
in components could sell to a vendor for 5 sp - it just won't ever sell for
more than 500. Consider the new system a check on dev stupidity. ;-)
