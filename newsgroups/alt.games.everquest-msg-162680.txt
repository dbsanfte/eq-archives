That's strange you would say that cause I was in Gorge of King Xorbb a
few weeks ago waiting for an eye to spawn and lost track of my pet
somehow. I really dont know how it happened, but when I looked around,
he was wandering back around the corner, headed my way with a pack of
guards on his tail......a minute later I found myself 'bind point
nekkid'.  Don't have a clue what went wrong, but been keeping a close
eye on my pet ever since.
