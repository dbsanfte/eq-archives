I put my druid to bed at 52.  The slow XP crawl is a perception thing ... XP
seems to drip in because it becomes more difficult to find a place to quad.

I went through several stages where I was between quadding lvls with the
druid and almost put him down for good.  46 was one.  You ding 46 ... and
what you were quadding has light blued out, leaving you with not quite
enough mana (even with medding at the end of a quad) to take the next step.
That root/dot lvl seems to take forever because you're used to getting 1.5
blue bubs per mana load and suddenly you're just getting a few ticks
instead.

When you do the same thing at 52, you hit the 'screw it' stage much faster
... taller speedbump to get over, plus the fact that you've been here
before.

And, if you're like me and pretty much soloed your way to 52, you're leery
of groups.  You get a new heal at 51 ... but it's still not enough to keep a
reasonably aggressive tank alive.  You compensate by throwing your heal
earlier than you'd like, because you don't trust yourself to keep that tank
standing at crunch time.  And pray to Karana that you get a cleric to join
you so you can go back to throwing your DS and standing in the corner.

Which is why I'm spending so much time with my ogre now .... :-)
