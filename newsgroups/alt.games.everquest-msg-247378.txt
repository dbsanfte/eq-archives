   Well, protect free speech that doesn't annoy you, anyways, right?

Heh.  Toon probably did start as leet speak.  It is now evolving to normal
slang for many of users of MMORPG.  I sometimes find myself using it,
though I don't really consider myself to be a leeter.

   "Toon" simply fills a need.  It is easier to type/spell than
"Character".  Not by much, but still.  Personally, I think that "Avatar"
would be a better word, which could be shortened to "Ava".  But I don't
have any control over how the language is actually evolving, any more than
you do.
