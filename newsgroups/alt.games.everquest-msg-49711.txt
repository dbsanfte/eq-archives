Not at all impossible

The single spawn spectre in Ferrott, already mentioned, would be a 
natural, but is very frequently occupied by necros.

The undead ruin in Dreadlands (go north from FV tunnel) would be
a good choice. There are 5-6 skeleton spawns there, mostly
plaguebones which are mid 30s in level. There will be some
greater spurbones which are 40ish and occasionally wraithbone
champions which are low 40s.

Some of the spawns are close together, however I never had 
problems with adds. Kunark skeletons, while aggressive, do
not seem to be social thus can be single-pulled from a distance.

One problem with this spot is that non-undeads do sometimes
wander through. One nice thing about it is that if soloing gets 
boring, shouts for healers from KC wall groups are frequent.
