You take your normal character and group to the NPC, get a monster
'mission', pick a monster template from the options for that mission, zone
into the mission instance, buy your abilities for your monster and then
fight the mission.

You earn no XP for kills during the mission, but when you succeed and zone
out, you receive XP.  In the mission we did, a chest is openable at the end
with a NO DROP no stat item, which 'transforms' into the loot when you zone
out (caused us an issue, since it was looted by someone who couldn't use
it,  because we weren't sure what would happen).

I did the Nagafen mission, took us a couple of tries to get it going, but
playing Nagafen and the Giants was a *BLAST*, I have no laughed and grinned
and smiled in EQ that much in a long time.

I'm not sure about the zero risk XP and Loot approach (if you die as a
giant you just 'run back' and if you die as Nagafen the mission is over,
and you all just appear back outside, no rez required, no xp loss) but it's
bloody good fun.

I messed with a level 15 earth elemental monster shroud as well (totally
separate to monster missions, also they use the same concept of buying
abilities for your monster template), and in about 15 kills in PC earned 2%
AA for the level 70 toon who was shrouded.

So if ever some of my lowbie friends come back to EQ, I can quite happily
hang out with them somewhere on a shrouded toon and at least earn *some*
progression on my main.
