    And one more thing (I'd snip the above, but I wanted there to be one
consistent flowchart of what to do). When you first encounter a chest, if
you have a priest class with their chest spells have them attempt to detect
traps first, before any of the steps listed above. If the chest has priest
class locks and/or traps on it, their spell will go off normally and you
know to let them deal with it. If the chest doesn't have priest locks/traps
on it, they will be unable to cast their detection spell at all - they get
the message "This spell only works on the cursed". Then you know for certain
that it's either a mechanical or INT-caster chest, and to let those classes
do their inspect/detect/etc. routine.
