I haven't looked into anything at all, actually, other than reading some 
of the recent threads in this NG about EQ2.

PvP, however, strikes me as the worst of ideas; to whatever extent EQ1 
suffers from dick waving, any PvP environment has to do the same thing 
in spades.  Why would I want to join a game thats tailor made for 
griefers?  And in addition to the "he put in twice as much time 
mindlessly slogging thru content to get better gear than me so I'm just 
dead" problem, there's the apparantly universal fact that actually 
getting class balance to work in the real world is nigh impossible; if I 
happen to play a Steam Shovel Operator which turns out to be 
devestatingly effective in pvp combat, while Penguin Inspector turns out 
to be nearly useless, then I get to kick "other guy" butt?  Please, 
spare me!

At the moment I'm playing around with NWN, and I imagine it will be 
quite a few months if not years before I'm bitten by the MMOG bug again; 
I'd certainly need to see something thats both better than and different 
than EQ.  Basic problem I see with EQ2 is that while it might be better, 
its not different enough, I don't really want to hear anything further 
about Qeynos and Freeport, if I'm starting anew I'd like it to be doing 
something completely new!

That said, I did like the basic idea of MMOG a lot; I was doing RPG, 
sort of, but without the artificial restriction of a party consisting 
only of a few friends who live in my area, and without the crushing 
restriction of actually being able to find people in my area who all are 
free at the same times to play regularly... now that I'm out of school, 
and have real work to do and a wife and two kids; and have to multiply 
that difficulty by similar difficulties on the parts of each potential 
party member... well I'd pretty much given up on playing with other 
humans ever again.

Instead I got a situation where I could play solo or with other people, 
pretty much any time night or day; better than my best days in high 
school or college.

So I expect I'll be back someday... and I hope, by then, that someone 
will have invented a better mousetrap.
