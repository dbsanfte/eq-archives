You've got the Geforce 4 Ti 4600?
I've been told that this is the one with the TV tuner and RCA/S-video inputs
and outputs and does GREAT video capture.
Can you confirm this for me? If so I'm considering getting one.
Also how does it do with DVD playback?  Do you need hardware player (Power
DVD) or software player (WinDVD)?
Also where did you buy it, and for how much?
