The question I guess I have is why does it matter? You dont have more 
skills than you have slots for in the 6 slot bank. Well, ok you 
do....but how often do you use beg? Lets look at them for a Ranger.

For combat the first two slots are taken for Melee, and Archery. Then 
you have; bind wound, taunt, and kick. There's five. Is disarm a button 
skill? If so then there's six slots filled. Then you have the six skill 
slots: fishing, sense heading, track, forage, sneak, and hide. The only 
one left is beg, and honestly I don't know why you would want to have it 
up.
