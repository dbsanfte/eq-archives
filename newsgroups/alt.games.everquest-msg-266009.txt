Just how many stages are we talking about? And if its simply going from 
place to place triggering the spawn, it sounds like the main timesink is 
-travel-, which is entirely predictable, and likely quite boring.

I concede I overstated the case. My real gripe is with mid level content 
from 30th level named to the Kael arena and even beyond being 
trivialized by having a few to several ubers along to get you through 
it.

I'd like to get away from being rewarded more by using ubers to get my 
own spawns than when I actually engage the content. For example... if I 
decide to try to get an X for my 45th level guy, I can put a group of 
45s together and head for ZoneOfX... or I can ask a guildie with a 70th 
who's not doing anything to go there and farm it with me. The 2nd 
strategy, provides no challenge, no risk, is easier to arrange, and is 
likely to get me the drop faster too.

And, yes, it does bug me (as in it detracts from the immersion) when I 
travel somewhere, especially somewhere out of the way, get there, and 
find it camped by -anyone-, ubers or otherwise. As someone else said... 
"the Mayor sent -me- to kill the X... It shouldn't be dead on arrival."

Triggered spawns sort of solves that but not really as the spawn area 
may not be free.

It reinforces the attitude that the first 70 levels are just an obstacle 
to be plowed through to get to the challenging stuff.

I agree. That kills a racing game for me. Fortunately I'm not advocating 
that... I'm advocating the sort of racing game where it has events where 
if you want to compete against class C convertibles to unlock a new 
track, you pick a suitable class C convertible... you can't take the 
Ferrari. See the difference? I don't want encounters to scale to me, I 
don't want to take my class C convertible into the ferrari race and have 
them all slow down for me. 

But merely knowing someone with a ferrari shouldn't allow me to win all 
the races in D, C, and B class events.

The only 'truly' challenging track in the game shouldn't be the ferrari 
race.
