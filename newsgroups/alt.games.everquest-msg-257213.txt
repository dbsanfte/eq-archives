No, safe is entirely relevant.  If archery does equal or better DPS
compared to melee, and is safer (because you are out of range of the
opponent, because it gives less aggro, whatever), then that means
there is never any reason to use melee weapons.  That's an imbalance,
if we assume that rangers are supposed to want to melee.  Thus,
improving archery DPS would "break" the game, if only ever so
slightly.

This is probably why archery does less damage than melee except for
trueshotting rangers.  Or at least that's my guess.
