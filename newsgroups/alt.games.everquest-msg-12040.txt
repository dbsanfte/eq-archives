Greetings,
	I have a level 30 Iksar Necro, that I want to take to the old
world.  Obiously I'm KOS everywhere.  I want to be able to visit/trade
in such cities as Queynos and FreePort. I know I'll have to kill a ton
of gnolls and orcs (easy to do with pet), but I heard that my diety
(Cavis-Thule) will cause problem and maybe I can't even get enough
faction.
	Or do I try getting enough faction with the "dark" cities.
	Any help would be apperciated.

	Sardarn Iksar Necro of 30 Shadows
	Sardarny Halfing Druid of 29 Trees
	Sardarnz Iksar Shamen of 9 Buffs

	All on Zeb
