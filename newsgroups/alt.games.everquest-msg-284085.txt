I'm in complete agreement with you, but stress again the point that
the thread in question *was* completely harmonious to start with.
However, Chorkie and her "Cult of Self" will simply brook nothing less
than 100% agreement with anything she says. As soon as people
disagreed with her, 'harmony' went out the window.  Life's too short
to bother with people like that in real life, let alone in a newsgroup
devoted to an online game.
