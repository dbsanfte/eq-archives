I did the fungus beasties solo after the shrooms started to go lt blue.  
Very rare to get an add, as most any area only has one wanderer, and I 
just make sure to be careful.  Didn't have too much trouble handling him 
when he did add.  Soloed my Druid to 24 there, Enchanter to 24, Ranger to 
15 so far.  For both the Druid and Enchanter, I did various shrooms, then 
fungus beasties, then some Shriknar.  Ranger was still working on 
shrooms.
