Prayer cloth of Tunare is got in Crushbone by giving a bracer of battle 
(off the Warlord? but sells for 40pp or so) to the high elven priest guy in 
the building opposite the slaver caves. It is a wis3 shoulder-slot item. 
Braided ivy cords are a step up, WIS5, drops sometimes from Thistle 
Underbrush, a brownie in LFay. Don't even try to get this before you can 
wolf-form to stop being KOS to the wandering brownies there. Even then, I 
would wait until 29 or so if you want to solo the little bugger.

Good item *if* you're a Karana follower, otherwise use any old thing 
(Blackened Iron Medallion or something) until you quest for a warden symbol 
of Tunare. Great item, since it has mana free right-clicky root spell, 
which can get you out of a lot of scrapes when you completely run out of 
mana - park stuff while you med for that last dot or whatever.
