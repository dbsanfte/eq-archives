My guild is decidedly non-uber.  I'm fine with that, and none of them 
really WANT to be uber.  They just want to play the game.

As a guild, we're just starting to farm Halls of Testing (quite a few of 
us have been there before, but on other people's raids) to give you an 
idea of about our level.  On the 2 runs we've done, we've done OK, but not 
great.

One problem that I think we have, is that people want to set their sights 
too high too early.  Suggesting we try things we obviously are not ready 
for as a guild.

two nights ago in /gu, someone suggested we take a couple groups down to 
the old AOF room in Cazic Thule to see what spawns there now.  I explained 
he really DIDN'T want tot  see it, as the place is now a ring type event 
of incredibly difficult proportions.  To prove my point, I posted a screen 
shot of the fighting there from the FoH page.

His reponse?

"Cool, we should take some people down there."

*sigh*
 
I'm all for new challenges, it's the way I WANT to play the game.  But 
walking into something that we are OBVIOUSLY NOT READY for is colosolly 
stupid.  We will get owned, hard and fast, and most likely be stuck 
getting corpses summoned.  It's setting ourselves up for obvious failure, 
and that has no benefit in it.  It's a waste of time and energy.

But if I say this is anyway, the whiny little people are going to tell me 
I'm holding them back, when it's THEY who don't see the bigger picture. 
/sigh

I dunno what to do...
