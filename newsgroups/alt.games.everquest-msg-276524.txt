This should have gone into the update message as well.  Ky was out sick, 
so it was accidentally missed (hope you're felling better Ky.)

Tradeskills

- Changed the text on Culturally Inspired Armor - part 3 to accurately 
reflect the pelts used for Half Elven cultural tailored armors.

- Added a book to outline the creation of the new cultural sewing kits.

- All of the new cultural sewing kits can now be traded in to Caerlyna 
in the Bazaar for tokens.

- Meeka Diggs in Rivervale no longer sells Iron Thread and should now 
sell the three sizes of Mercurium Thread.

- Added some missing Troll cultural items to vendors in Neriak.

- There was a new "Chunk of Ice" created for the Dragons of Norrath 
expansion. This new "Chunk of Ice" has been removed and replaced with 
the old "Chunk of Ice" on the forage tables for all Dragons of Norrath 
zones. They should also now drop off some of the colder dervishes. All 
of the new Dragons of Norrath drink recipes that used "Chunk of Ice" 
(Curdled Cream, Iced Coffee, Iced Tea and Iced Mountain Tea) now use the 
old "Chunk of Ice"

- Fixed a bug with the recipe for creating Barbarian cultural leather 
swatches. The recipes were mistakenly using the "Norrathian Needle" 
instead of the "Northman Needle".

- Fixed a bug in the recipe for creating the Dragons of Norrath cultural 
armor patterns that could allow a player to recover their ruined book 
with a successful salvage. Sorry, that was unintentional.

- Removed the Erudite Sewing Kit from vendors. The new kit is created by 
players and should replace the old kit.

- Fixed the Feir'Dal Fletcthing Kit. Really, we did.

- Fixed the Surefall Fletching Kit. (This was actually fixed with the 
last update).

- Fixed the Reinforced Jeweler's Kit. (This was actually fixed with the 
last update).

- Changed the Dragons of Norrath cultural recipes that used "Quill" to 
now use "A Quill" (used in research recipes). "A quill" is also now sold 
on the appropriate vendors. (This was actually changed with the last 
update).
