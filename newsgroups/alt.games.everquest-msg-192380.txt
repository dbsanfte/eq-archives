So I am trying to "Kill two birds with one stone" here. I have been assigned
two different projects for two different courses, one a Computer Science
course, the other a Anthropology course. The Computer Science project is to
develop a web site using a back end database that can build dynamic pages.
The Cultural Anthropology course wants us to research an area and write a
paper on the culture. Instead of doing this on some boring geographic area I
will be doing it on "Norrath" a virtual culture and how people from all over
the world can join in this single culture. Hopefully, finding a correlation
of real life to the characters people choose and how they play.

Please help me by taking the following survey I created. All the submissions
are completely anonymous and please only answer the questions you feel
comfortable answering.

Thanks again for your help, after you take the survey results will be
available.
