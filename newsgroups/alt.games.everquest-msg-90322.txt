These may not be 100% true... but most score at least 82% ;o)

#1 No matter HOW quiet you try to keep any newly discovered tactic... it
WILL end up being common practice in less than a week, after some gimp
observes you doing it and complains your class needs to be 'nerfed'

#2 (see #1) ... and if your new tactic IS so good that everyone starts a new
character of the same class as yours, it WILL get a heavy beating from the
'nerf stick'

#3 The people who complain the loudest about any 'nerf' are the ones who
haven't had a chance to benefit from it themselves

#4a The other guys class ALWAYS looks better than yours

#4b ... and when YOU try to play that class that looked so hot on the other
guy, you'll spend all your time medding/healing/wondering why you can't find
anything worth fighting

#5 Even Warriors sometimes get pestered for 'buffs'

#6 That hot new item you spent serious plat on today, will be un-sellable
tommorow

#7 By the time you get to that uber-mob you spotted on tracking, some Wizzie
will have nuked it to a pile of ash

#8 Just after you've spent 20 minutes medding up after summoning a load of
food, drink, heatstones for the group, arrows, throwing daggers and a
half-decent pet... you WILL go link-dead

#9 That last nuke, when you're low on mana but the MOB is so close to death
it can win you the fight... WILL fizzle

#10a When you're trying to taunt a MOB off the Enchanter, the Enchanter WILL
keep running away and taking the MOB out of taunt range...

#10b ... and when he dies... YOU will still get the blame

#11a When your Enchanter is getting beaten on by some ticked off MOB, no
matter how many tanks are nearby... you WILL die...

#11b ...and after you respawn back at your bind point you will see the
words... "I thought you were fine... you were just standing there"

#12 You bind point is NEVER where you want it to be... no matter HOW
recently you re-bound yourself

#13a Any Guild small enough for you to get to know everyone in it... WILL be
wiped

#13b Any Guild large enough to survive a guild-wipe will have so many people
in it, all changing on a regular basis, that you'll never make any friends

#14 That vendor, who is the ONLY vendor within 6 zones who sells that vital
thing you NEED... RIGHT NOW... will be missing from his posistion or 'busy
right now'

#15 20 minutes after you've cleared out your bank-vault and sold what you
thought was junk to the nearest vendor, you WILL see the words "WTB <insert
junk>... paying well"

#16 That 'must have' spell that will make the next 4 or 5 levels so much
easier to get thru... is always ONLY for sale in a city where you're KOS

#17 If you use a long word like 'Immutable'... some 12-year-old school
underachiever WILL call you 'gay'

#18 Whilst reading this list you WILL say the word 'lol' out loud

#19a When you've spent more than half an hour camping a particular
experience spawn... some monk WILL come along and accidentally pull the
whole spawn... and run towards you expecting help from you after ruining
your painstakingly broken camp...

#19b ...and when you start to back away, he'll feign... and the whole spawn
will come after YOU...

#19c ... and if you dare kill anything that's been trained onto you, you'll
be accussed of KSing by the monk

#20a Your expensive alternative weapon that you carry around to practice
neglected combat skills looks EXACTLY like the crummy looted weapon you just
picked up becasue you're now broke after buying the good weapon...

#20b ... and you don't realise it until AFTER you've sold it to a vendor for
2 plat

#21 After 2 weeks of careful experimentation and observation, when you
finally announce to your Guild that you've discovered how to trigger a rare
NPC-spawn... at least half a dozen people will reply they've known about it
for ages, and it's all detailed on some obscure web-site

#22 Whenever you think you've found a deserted area in which to kite a
particularly nasty MOB... you WILL accidentally train it onto some poor
unsuspecting Wizzie who was medding behind a tree...

#23 Even if there are only TWO druids on the entire server... they will BOTH
end up trying to kite the same HG... and BOTH will wonder why their 'snare'
doesn't seem to be taunting the giant in THEIR direction

#24a Your think you've pulled that MOB... you haven't... it's been pulled by
a Ranger, standing behind you, doing obscene amounts of damage with some
uber-bow

#24b You think you've bow-pulled that MOB rushing towards you... you
haven't... another Ranger behind you has pulled it with an even BETTER bow
and longer range arrows

#25a A wise Necromancer learns not to have the hot-keys for his uber-dot and
'Feign' next to each other...

#25b ... and the same goes for a Cleric with 'Root' and 'Divine Aura'
