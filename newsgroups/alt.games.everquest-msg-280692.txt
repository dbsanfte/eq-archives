I was talking to a friend who plays EQ2 almost exclusively, and she told 
me that major changes were upcoming for EQ2, I did not realize they were 
that major.  I knew that spells and abilities were being redone 
significantly.  Anyway, I am with you on this.  EQ still holds a lot more 
interest for me than EQ2, I gave it a pretty fair shot, and found it 
lacking for me, largely due to the feeling of being coddled along and 
protected from the evil other players who might interfere with what I am 
doing.
