Nope, you want to put every point you can into wisdom. Stamina is pretty
trivial for us because unless you group a great deal (*very* rare at
higher levels, even if you *want* to, since druids are absolutely the
least desired raid class); you aren't going to be getting hit much when
soloing, once you get up in levels a bit. Wisdom determines mana and
mana is life for a druid. If you want more hps, all you have to do is
invest in a pair of fire opal rings, or look for gear that adds hp, in
addition to wisdom and mana. =)
