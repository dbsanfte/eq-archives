We stand the MA and SA near where he pops but use a WS ranger to take first
engage purely for the high aggro rate rangers produce to ensure that no
possible aggro is transmited from CC area tucked away. MA takes Emp off the
ranger before WS fades but a ranger death to the Gods of loot always yields
results.

Wiping at 99% (if i read that right?) .. yup, on chatting to a guildmate,
the reason for it was the Emp warped to the CC corner for some unknown
reason and ate a chanter which started a chain reaction of rapid death.
