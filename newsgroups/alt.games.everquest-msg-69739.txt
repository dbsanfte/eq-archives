Also, there is a little guy named Obdebevny Biddledipoop or some such thing.
He is a fairly High Level Jacka$$ who has killed me on one occasion so far.
I don't know what race he is or anything, just that he is a caster and will
whup yer butt.  The Ghoulish Messenger hangs out in WK and has something for
the Ranger Epic I believe.  Also, Shamans need to go there to talk to the
Wandering Spirit for their Epic I believe.  Wandering Spirit looks like a
Wisp, but is red for a very long time...  LOL  At level 24, it is finally
yellow to me.

If you are a Ranger, people will pay you some good money in assisting them
in tracking the Messenger and the Spirit btw...  I get tells almost
everytime through asking if I will assist someone in Tracking something.  I
never seek out people to charge, I just let them contact me and I never ask
for payment, they always offer.  It works out very well.  hehe...

Does anyone know anything about the Ogres in this zone?  I conned them from
a distance and they conned Amiable to me.  I didn't approach them however
for fear that the con was a bug and they would instead squish me
immediately.  LOL!  If they are indeed amiable to good races, I'll go up and
talk to them next time through...

Thanks!
