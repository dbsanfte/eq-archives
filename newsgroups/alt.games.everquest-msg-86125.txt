Hey, guess what, INTEL SUXXOR for me...  Every Intel chip I've had has been
buggy, freezes a lot, and has massive amounts of memory holes that I can
stick my arm through.

And the whole thing about EQ, "officially supporting" intel is nothing more
than a marketing gimmick to try and sell more intel chips, there are NO
programming routines used that make intel superior.

And last I checked, no one else around here was that concerned with
performance issues using a Pinnacle Systems movie card.

Also, you say that Everquest and your Video editor have "MINOR" issues with
AMD chipsets, I'm not sure, but it would seem to me that 2 programs having
minor issues is a lot better than every program freezing and crashing a lot.

Now, don't get me wrong, AMD is far from perfect, but they beat the snot out
of Intel in terms of performance and stability, at least for me. (and about
20 of my RL technophile friends)
