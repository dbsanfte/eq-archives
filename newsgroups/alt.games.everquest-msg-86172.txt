I would be interested , tell me what server . I have played most classes to
a certain extent , and would not mind playing any class. I would like to
form a regular party of adventurers to go the entire game with , covering
every zone and every dungeon along the way . I am not interested in just
creating goofy newbies and running around aimlessly though , so if thats
what you meant , no thanks . But if you are serious about building a team
and experiencing EVERYTHING I want in. I have talked to others who have done
this and they all say it has been the most fun of their gaming lives .
I might suggest Vazaelle server or Friona Vie , Vazaelle is begining to
mature but it is the youngest standard rule server, Friona Vie could be real
fun as I hear it is not taken to well by the most Uber of EQ players and has
a low population.
