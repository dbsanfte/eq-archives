Weapons do damage when they hit.

They hit with a frequency based on their delay.

In a round, they may also double attack

They may proc every time they attack.

So, damage per round is weapon damage plus procs plus damage bonus times
attacks.  This is the same regardless of delay of the weapon, or your haste
status.

Damage Per Second, then, is your damage per round divided by your delay,
modified by your haste.

Of course in addition to this, you have spells, which do damage per cast and
have a spell cast time and a delay before you can cast again and one before you
can cast that spell again, which can be modified by spell haste effects and some
trickery with clicky effects.

Then you also have DOT type effects, which lay in damage on a quite
undisturbable pulse rate.

Your group, then, will have a total DPS based on all sorts of different rates of
damage output, and its best in many ways to put the whole question of rounds out
of your head entirely, by and large its meaningless.  What you need to know, if
anything, is how long it will take you to do enough damage to kill your target.

In the case of opponents with regeneration, you have to subtract the Regen per
Second of the mob from the DPS of your group in order to make that kind of
calculation.  A mob with 1000 hp would take 100 seconds to kill with a 10DPS.
But if it has a 9 hp per second regen, then it will take 1000 seconds to kill
it... and if it has an 11 hp per second regen you will never ever kill it!

Damage per second per round.. seems meaningless to me
