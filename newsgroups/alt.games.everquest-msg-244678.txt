Looking on the EQ Atlas map it is marked as "Disco".  When you go in and you
run to the left passed the door to the exit and cross the bridge, you go
down a long corridor and come to a big door that has a golem or something
sitting on a ledge over the door.

That's the door I'm asking about whether I need a rogue or key.

Thanks all for trying to answer what appeared to be a vague question by me.
