First off all I play is bards now just to be immune to KEI and be able
to solo cause its getting tough to find groups. It is without any
doubt EQ set to easy mode. To argue differently is to play the fool.

Since the widespread use of KEI, some nights its hard to find 5 people
xp grouping on the entire server. Yeah I know its not that bad but its
getting there, and quickly. To be honest if solo is all there is why
play?

Two solutions here. Cut it back to one hour base and no one will
bother with it much. Four hours on a buff is way outa line. Heck you
can do a whole level in your 40s in that time easy. But chanters
wanted a long lasting buff so..... 

Even better make all versions of KEI wide AOE. No way to make money on
it but it remains in the game. Chanters keep what they lobbyed for in
the first place, KEI market goes away except for random acts of
kindness. EQ economy returns to sane mudflation. Peace and harmony
rule the land.

Now either would be great. Oh the howls of addicts in withdrawal alone
would be worth logging in to see. Yes I am a saddist but also a
republican so its ok.
