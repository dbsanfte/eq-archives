I'd go for 26.  After all, its easy to not level, just stop killing mobs 
that aren't green.  Why stop at 24, when other PK people can level up to 
26 and have a better shot at taking you out due to the better resists 
and HP, and you having less chance of resisting their spells?

Over 26, I bet you lose 90 of potential kills, since people are going to 
be picking off the level 6 people like flies as soon as they level up to 
that point.

Splendid
