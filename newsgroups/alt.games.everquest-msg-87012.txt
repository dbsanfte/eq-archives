Ive hunted there quite a bit (giants have too many hp :P) and Ive found it
safe to root kite them down in the valley to the south (west of the mine).
They wander about as far as the slope, then turn back. Obviously, youll need
to look out for the shardwurms there. Near the hill where youve been is
definitly a better spot.

I wouldnt bother with GD. Skyfire is quicker xp. Giants have bad HP/XP
ratio. I have heard of a couple of druids going from 58-60 on the othmirs in
CS (not sure if he was quad kiting).
