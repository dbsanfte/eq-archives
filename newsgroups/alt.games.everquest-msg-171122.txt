You're a BST?  Didn't know our pets stick around after we die, actually I
was pretty sure they didn't.  But, no matter, it's pretty easy to get rid of
your pet if he gets charmed... I had a neut PK on SZ try that several
times... he thought he'd just hide and charm my pet and use him to kill
me... well, all you have to do is type "/pet get lost" and the charmed pet
will disappear.
