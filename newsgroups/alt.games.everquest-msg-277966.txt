Since re-starting EQ, I've had my SK in Lower Guk.  I started him at the 
entrance to the dead side, worked past the bedroom, and am now working the 
spiders and gargs.  His packs were full of silk, so I pulled him out last 
night and transferred the silks to my mule (who's not been up since I came 
back).

Adjusted prices (boy, have things changed), and went to bed.

This morning, I had sold a Lammy for three times what I remember them going 
for, a Wurmy for twice what I remember them going for, a few old pieces of 
crusty armor for twice what I remember it going for .... and not a single 
silk at 1/3 of what I remember them going for.

That seems to indicate to me that no one tradeskills anymore, or at least 
that no one is a beginning tradeskiller anymore.  Of course, its anecdotal 
evidence with and a supposition on top, but I would think that out of 400 or 
so silks someone would've bought at least a stack.
