You are kidding, right?  How can I accept a group when I have no idea who is
in the group or what they want to do?  What if I were a DE and the wanted to
hunt Orcs in BB or CB?  That would be real smart on my part.  Introduce
yourself and your group (if it is already formed) and then invite me.  I
have standards of who I will group with and being rude and uncommunicative
will put you on the never group with list.
