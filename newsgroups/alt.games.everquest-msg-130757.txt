49 wizard checking in here. In addition to the suggestions offered by
others, you need to bring some pressure on your guild, preferably
through your guild boards, etc.  First off, recruit some damned wizards.
I do port service prior to raids, and I do *not* leave once I'm in to go
get stragglers. Make that clear. Second reason for wizards is that we
can TL people out when they have to leave or at the end. Sooooo much
more convenient than a druid having to bind themselves in a raid area
(if they even can) and port out, in, out, in, go change bind point again
aftwards.... horseshit.

Get wizards and demand some fair respect from the guild leadership.
