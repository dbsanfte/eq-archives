bah.. I finally finished the patch after about 13 hours of messing.. and it
gives me no 3d device found.. downloading 8.1 now... grrr......says there is
like 2 hours left.. this is rediculus, they should have done something like:
send 3 dollars in and we will send you a patch CD with the latest patch and
dx8.1.  would have saved everyone (including them) some time.
