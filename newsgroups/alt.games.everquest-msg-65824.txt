FWIW, I recall reading somewhere that the decision to go DirectX8.1
came fairly late in the development of SoL, which means that the made
the decision probably only a couple of weeks ago.  I'm sure that
Sony/Verant will remove any references to Win95 on future packaging.

Personally, I really don't see this as that much of an issue, as that
upgrading the OS to at least Win98 is painless and reasonably
inexpensive.

And there is no easy solution in this one for Sony/Verant either.  Not
only is it unfair to expect them to hamstring their software in a
market that is rapidly becoming very competitive, but asking them to
recall all the previous versions of EQ, Kunark, and Velious is
impractical and excessive.  And a blanket return policy has the
potential to become a customer service hassle of epic proportion.
