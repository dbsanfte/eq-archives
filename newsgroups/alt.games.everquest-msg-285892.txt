Maybe this was obvious to everybody but me, but I finally figured
out something that had been bugging me for a long time, so I thought
I'd share it in case it helps someone.

I've often noticed that, when I switch characters, the new character
starts out with a screwy camera angle, angling up or down.  I'd hit
"home" to level my view and continue, but I wondered why the camera
sometimes started out skewed and sometimes not.  I thought perhaps
it had to do with the camera angle when I camped the previous toon,
but I tried deliberately pointing the camera in various directions
when I camped and it didn't seem to affect anything.

I finally figured it out when both my mule and another character
logged in and found themselves looking straight down.  I realised
that the last time I'd been aimed that way was when I had floated
down to the Relic teleport pad in Arcstone.  It turns out the initial
camera angle is the same as the last time you ZONED.  So if your
camera is pointing upward when you zone, then even if you level it
off again before camping, the next character you log in will have it
aimed upward again.  And if that character camps without zoning, the
next one will again be looking upward on log-in.  (The most common
case for me was camping to switch to my bazaar mule, who of course
almost never zones, so the old camera angle would apply both to the
mule and later to whatever character I switched back to.)

This seems to be something that the client remembers.  I.e., it's
saving the camera angle so it can restore it when you finish zoning,
perhaps?  If you exit the client completely and start from scratch,
it starts with a level camera again.
