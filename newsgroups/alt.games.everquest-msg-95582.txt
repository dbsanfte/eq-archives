Ok. Absor is once again backpedaling on the developers' boards and has
REVERSED his statement about the pet classes and exp. going to pets in a
group.  Here's the latest and (dare we hope?) final answer on this.

Hello.
I have an update, rather a correction, on one of the answers to the
questions that the Mage Compendium folks sent in.

I was just informed by Scott Hartsman that I made a mistake about the
pet experience thing. Pets only take experience from a group if they
outdamage the entire group. If they do, then they gain a share as if
they were a group member. If they do not, they take no experience at
all.

This is how it's been working the whole time, and it makes a lot more
sense. I'm sorry for the mistake.

So, there you have it. Not even the 1% thing we'd been buying all along.
Pet does more damage than the rest of the PC's combined, get's a full
share as a group member. If you all do cumulative damage greater than
the pet does (and if you can't you need to leave) then the pet get's
nothing. Hopefully this information will get propogated widely and some
of the pet classes will become more welcome in groups where people were
paranoid about the pet sucking all the xp out of the camp.
