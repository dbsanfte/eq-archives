Agreed.  I don't get to play as much as I'd like and was sure I'd missed the
Halloween events.  I was thrilled when my friends and I logged in for our
regular session and Varsoon popped up in QHills with his army.  It was
great fun.  Had my first experience with a Warbone Skeleton.  It made short
work of two Rangers and a Paladin (we are all 14-15).  Now I know what
my ass looks like on a silver platter with a sprig of parsley.  Lesson learned.
When a Warbone says it's red, it really means it!
