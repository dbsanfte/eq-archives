When the game is not crashing it does seem to help out with the additional
512 megs of memory.  But what I did to see the increase was to go into the
motherboard BIOS and specify that 256 megs of system memory can be reserved
for the AGP Aperture size.  This setting specifies the  amount of system
memory that the AGP device can use.  Basically this space is dedicated for
graphics memory address space.

When I did this I lost a large amount of lag during fights where a large
amount of particle affects were going off.  Since I now have 1 gig of memory
it was not a big deal to reserve 256 mes of that just for my AGP device.  I
may be wrong but I think what doing this does is give the graphics card sort
of a cahce buffer in memory.  Even tough the graphics card has 128 megs of
on board memory if additional data is needed it can store some ino in system
ram that it can then go and grab quicker.

Please do not flame me if I am totaly wrong in this assumption.  I just know
that increasing this specification in BIOS did improve the graphics during
fights, with much less video lagging.
