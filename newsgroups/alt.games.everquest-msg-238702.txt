Dont be too sure there.  We have an excellent cleric puller on Saryrn by the
name of Lollador (sp?).  He likes to pull, so I let him.  Of course, then he
has my bard to back him up on cc.  Sounds like there wasnt much cc going on
for Annie's group.  Also, good warriors get aggro quickly on the pull.  I
dont know how they do it, but some do and some dont do.  What I do when I'm
getting beat too much is snare or mez on the pull, hopefully timing it to
land right next to the tank.  Dont know if root would work for that since
you have to stop to cast it.  Maybe you could get that druid to help you out
there.  Another trick to pulling is if you bring it while the previous mob
is still being beat on, then train your tank!  The new mob will almost
certainly assist the old mob.  You gotta have a decent tank tho or he might
die.  I guess Annie you may never pull again, but if you do these are some
ideas you might try.
