I figure a good number of people here are fans of fantasy novels, so I
thought I'd share a recommendation.

Just finished reading Black Sun Rising by C.S. Friedman.  It's the first in
a trilogy and I have the other two coming from Amazon.

This book is one of the first non-clichï¿½ fantasy books I've read.  Most
fantasy authors tend to borrow from Tolkien, Herbert and other writers a
great deal and those books while they can be good, remind me of other books
I've read.  Black Sun Rising was a totally unique and new story and very
worth reading.  Good deal of humor to balance out the dark story, and very
well done characters.

I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy and is looking for something
new.
