Well, in the absence of any other known comparable sources of EQ2 
information, I've been hanging out in the SoE EQ2 forums for a while. I'd 
forgotten how over-exposure to the that place can drain your soul. I have 
to restrain myself almost daily from replying to a thread and informing 
some poster what an unreasonable brat and malcontent they're being. When I 
leave that place, I feel like I'll never get clean.

The good information is there, but the signal to noise ratio is terrible.

Anyone got any other good sources of EQ2 info?
