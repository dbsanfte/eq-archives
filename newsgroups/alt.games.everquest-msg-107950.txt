I don't follow.

Not really accurate. Not caring about the outcome is different from
not caring to try. My opinions will keep coming. At least, for a
little while, I'm moving next week.

When you consider the fact I wasn't abusing anyone here in this
thread, only defending myself from those who, like petulant children,
feel they have to go at me every chance they get (*coughtwheadcough*),
the story changes somewhat.

Most of the people here have forgotten what I was arguing in their
zeal. Very flattering in a way. It shows they care. :-)

The truth is my responses are at the same level as what I'm responding
to. I don't become abusive unless they become abusive first. Go ahead,
see who called who an asshole first.

But of course, the clique didn't notice that, or if they did, they
chose to ignore it.

Correct.

    people die. You are selling things which make people die, but not
    only do they just die, they also become addicted to your product
    for tens of years before they die, thereby supplying you with
    obscene amounts of money in exchange for letting them die."
