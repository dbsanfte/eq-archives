If ever it was possible for a Warrior of equal level/gear to hold agro
from a Paladin or SK it would have to have been a very brief period
shortly after the original release of the game.  There was a fairly
long period of time (i.e. before the melee balancing they did months
after Kunark came out) where just about the only thing a Paladin/SK
had to offer was the ability to take and hold agro.  I suspect the
big issue you have now is lots of other people who haven't the first
clue about agro management.  Casters who've spent their entire career
blasting away heedlessly because they have KEI, and since they grouped
only with highly twinked hybrids who could take and hold agro in spite
of their incompetence (most of the time anyway), they've never had to
learn how to play.  The same goes for highly twinked melee damage
dealers who had gear so strong they could tank, and so it never hurt
to, for instance, just mash the backstab key every time it ungreyed.
Between KEI and the extreme twinking that is routine these days it's
pretty easy for people to get to 60+ and still be woefully incompetent
at playing their character, it isn't even really possible to spot an
ebayer anymore.  Hell, I'd be willing to bet (a small bet) that the
typical ebayer outplays the typical "natural" twink these days.
