Yep. That's what it looks like to me as well. Hmm, fair and equitable... not
really Verant's style, eh? As for the remedy to this problem, I forget where
it was or who posted it but evidently that recent patch made the Warders
unimaginably tough. "Just kick up the impossibility factor and don't worry
about it" seems to be their way of dealing.

Why would they have suddenly gotten the producer on the phone? It's obvious
he was out perusing the sites, came across Conquest's and blew his stack at
the fact that they were where they were. He then came up with some random
reason and, via a GM puppeteer, made sure they would never do such a thing
again. The fact that it was a total knee-jerk followed by almost random
justification is brutally clear. Really sucks for Conquest.

You'd think they wouldn't have made it live before they were ready for it,
wouldn't you? Alas, Verant: I understand you not.
