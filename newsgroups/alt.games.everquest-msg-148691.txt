I had a strange experience in Blackburrow last night which I wanted to
consult the group's collective experience about...

I was on my first trip to Blackburrow with my Level 6 Shaman.  It was
very late, so only 5 or 6 other people in the zone.

On a bad pull I attracted 3 scrawny gnolls which almost killed me. 
Virtually out of mana and health and with the route to either exit
blocked by a number of MOBs which I couldn't handle in my weakened
condition, I retreated to a corner to heal up / await my death. 
Unfortunately, it was the corner right in-front of the door to Level
3.  A few seconds later, a caster comes tearing out of the door, with
maybe 5 gnoll guardsmen right on his tail.  To my surprise, everyone
went right by me, even though by now gnolls pretty much hate me.  The
caster must have escaped, b/c a minute later all the guardsmen come
back, again go right by me, and back through the door...

I'm confused, because earlier in the night various trains had no
compunction about trying to squash me!

Does anyone understand MOB's (particularly gnoll's) aggro ratings and
could shed some light on this?  Did I get lucky or is this a "feature"
of Blackburrow?

Thanks,
Olric
