Yes, Sir you are correct, I DID NOT post such a message... The cyber
stalker is a nurse Filipino man named Daryl Pahimna. He has been
reported to the FBI for his criminal activities.


Daryl Pahimna alias Brother Brahman-Atmananda 
Box No. 207 Cabanatuan City 3100
Cabanatuan City, Philippines - 
Phone Number: 600 1253


Although, He claims to be living now in Central London, Great Britain


Thank you  Brian,


No, I did not post such message, the impostor is a Filipino man. 
I am a family man happily married. All these allegations are false


Please see below:


Brother Brahman-Atmananda 's slander cannot be tolerated any longer
for the sake of the spiritual boards. It is unfortunate that some in
this world have nothing better to do than to attempt to cause hurt to
others


It has been brought to my attention that Mr. Noel Daryl L. Pahimna
aka. Brother Brahman-Atmananda posted a message accusing me of
impersonating him under the pseudonym of Sri Brother
Brahman-Atmananda.. Mr. Pahimna as many of you know as B-A uses
different aliases and self-created characters such as Ojasvini, Da
Acharya Premabrahmananda Swami, Cranium, Jessai
http://profiles.yahoo.com/jessai, Red_Purusha, KatLover ,Lorraine,
Maritza and dozens more.
