A cleric in my group?  If he's in my group of course he's entitled to xp.  I
can't make any sense out of your inference, sorry.

As to purposely multipulling, that's cool...I do it too.  However, I make
sure I'm facing the critters AND am ready to say "I'm ok =)."  The original
poster (perhaps not in the original post) said that the 2nd wisp came up
behind them.  A reasonable person would assume that they did not know the
add was on its way, therefore fair game to anyone who decided to pull it off
them.
