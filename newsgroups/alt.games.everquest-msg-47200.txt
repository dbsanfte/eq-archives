 Sorry, no way to capture it here. Maybe sombody else can I hope, it is
a very high quality look at many aspects of EQ, most of it in high level
areas of Velious and Kunark. I recognized many of the places. Nothing of
Luclin that I could tell but there were a few places I didn't think I've
been to that may have been of Luclin.
 
 Go rent the movie! It's pretty good!
