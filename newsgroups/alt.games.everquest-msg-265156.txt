That is load of crap.

Plenty of situations in life (the biggest mmrpg of them all) dictate 
that you don't interfere with what someone else is doing.

If you see some kids playing football do you run in and tackle one of 
them? You know: "informal teamwork!"

 If you see a juggler juggling 4 balls do you run in and catch one? You 
know: "division of labor!"

If you see a guy bowling do you toss a ball down his lane to deal with 
his split? You know: "specialization!"

If you see two guys playing chess, do you run up and start making moves 
for one of them? You know... "informal teamwork, division of labor, 
specialization..."!

It is something you should have learned at home, in school, and in life. 
If someone's playing a game (and that's what PvE is!) you shouldn't 
interfere with it without their permission. Just because they're playing 
a massivly multiplayer game doesn't mean they're playing with you.  
Massively Multiplyer is like life, other people are always in the world 
with you, but they aren't necessarily welcome to participate in every 
aspect of it.
