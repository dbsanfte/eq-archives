My only criticism of the even is that just about all the mobs were magic
resistant. So you either fight the "correct" way, ie in a group with a tank
and healers, or you dont fight at all. Kinda sucks being able to solo easily
on blues in skyfire to xp up, and then when you really want your soloing
ability to get some loot, it gets taken away.

I guess for those uf us who have to group anyway cos they are a non solo
class, will think that this magic immmune stuff is a good thing (afterall it
dont hurt them). The odd immune monster (gullerback) is fair enough, but
every damn mob? sheesh.
