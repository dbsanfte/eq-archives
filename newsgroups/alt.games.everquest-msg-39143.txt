This isn't really related to EQ, but I'm having sound problems. I can't play
more than one sound file at a time. Example, if I have AIM on and I'm already
listening to some music, if someone IMs me, I can't hear the "beep" sound. I
would like to get SneakyAmp, but I can't really use it too well if it won't run
on top of EQ sounds. Any suggestions? I've had a long hard history of trouble
updating my drivers. Crystal Sound, and I have no idea what model.
