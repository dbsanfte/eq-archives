I guess I'm confused as to how this is an exploit? If you run off somewhere
that that crazy red mob won't/can't follow, it's an exploit? So, each and
every time I've high-tailed it to North Tower in Everfrost hoping for Tundra
Jack to wipe that pesky orc shaman off my butt it's an exploit? The fact
that I know TJ usually isn't too far from NT is a reference to the game
geometry... Or when I
start getting creamed by that bunch of elite gnoll guards and zone to Qeynos
Hills? The zones are a clear example of game geometry; the fact we  use them
to avoid mobs...

And why doesn't it work both ways? How come those pesky mobs can be too
high/low to be accessible by arrows? They're totally exploiting to my
detriment... hanging out up there mocking me with their little gnoll
butts... sorry. Personal issue there.

As for the Conquest bit, I think it was very ill-advised on the part of
Verant. I also was quite shocked by their press-release as, when viewing
Conquest's screenshots one could see the actual text of their conversation,
clearly demonstrating the severe adjustment of context. My friend, the guy
who introduced me to the game, took the "if they won't let you win, why
play?" and canned his account (I'm the resultant twink from Hell). I guess
I'm inclined to side with Conquest and be more than a little disgusted by
the severity of the punishment...
