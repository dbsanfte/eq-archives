I think respect for authority usually has to be learned from the parent, or
later on the hard way.  In this case the parent apparently has the attitude
that "So what if it's 'not for kids', he'll probably be ok".  It's no wonder
kids today are out of control.  But don't worry that the guide was too hard
on him.  He wasn't.  He might even have taught the kid a lesson you (op)
neglected.

"Teach your parents well..."
