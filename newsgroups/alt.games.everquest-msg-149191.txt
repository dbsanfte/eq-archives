I don't think the behavior of verant is a sign of something being
an exploit.  An "exploit" (ie called an exploit by verant) yes, but
that doesn't mean it is one by their posted definition of the term.

To me, tactics is using the tools you have at hand to do things,
whether the designers originally considered that option or not.
An exploit is using flaws in the game to do things that you should
not be able to do.  Using pathing problems to control mob
behavior, exploit, using root/atone to take advantage of mobs
attacking other mobs but still get the kill, tactics.

I grant you that, but its indicative, just as the hermit's door in SK has
a gap you can "shoot" him thru, the large and obvious hole in the
entrance to the Hole makes you think "hmm, maybe I can squeeze
thru there"

Why design that hole in the door in the first place, if this wasn't
intentional?  If the door was visibly solid, but you could still swim
thru it as you can now, then I'd say yes, its an exploit of the
poor implementation of geometry.
