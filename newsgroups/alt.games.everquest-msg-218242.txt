Peronally I have always apprecited it.

If I'm following a thread I already know where it is, so I can get the
latest response/info right off the bat without having to scroll
through potentially pages of already-read information.

If I haven't been following a thread and come in somewhere in the
middle (or end) I would read through individual posts anyway since
some stuff may have been snipped by other posters for the sake of
argument or expediency.  Either way I may be missing info by not at
least perusing the previous posts.

So what do top-post-haters see that top-post-lovers don't?  Besides
alot of redundant info.  :-]
