The High Shamen are *exceedingly* rare (well, not Targin or Raster rare, but
even so). I spent over a week camping SK for about 4 hours at a time,
killing the placeholders as soon as they spawned. You'll want a tracker to
help.

After killing Shaman Ren'Rex quite a few times, High Shaman Phido will spawn
in his place. Killing Shaman Lenrel enough times will cause High Shaman
Grisok to spawn as his replacement. The placeholders are on 19 minute
cycles, and both High Shamen always drop the quest items.

It's a long, boring camp. If you don't want to wait, occasionally you might
run into folks that have picked up the heads and are willing to give them
away (good!), or other times I've seen people selling the heads as much for
1Kpp a pop (which is mercenary, IMNSHO). The quest is hard enough without
other people farming the items. =(
