I played a *lot* of XvT back in The Zone. Those were the golden days of
gaming, just before beta of UO and EQ Phase one. Were you in any of the XvT
squads that competed on Case's Ladder, or ever run into anyone from the
JediMasters?

Yes, I distinctly remember the time I thought they could do no wrong in
gaming. Kind of how Blizzard is viewed by lots of folks, but with a much
bigger sampling (they and Microprose are probably pretty close in terms of
number of classics).
