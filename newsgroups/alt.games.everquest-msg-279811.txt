I was afraid some may have read too much into that. I said no "level-
inappropriate" buffs, not no buffs at all. Even still, I'm sure it will 
wind up a situation where drive-by Temp from a kindly passing player 
will be just fine as well. It will be the venturing into PoK to actively 
seek it out/solicit it that will be prohibited.

Since that post, I've also put more thought into the no purchasing of 
weapons and armor idea as well. People are going to amass some amount of 
coin from their adventuring. They will need something to spend it on. 
The most important point is that we don't want people to adopt a 
playstyle that is all about building wealth for gear upgrades.

Personally, I figure any coin I make during the normal course of 
adventuring will be spent on spells, food and other provisions 
(backpacks, tradeskill kits, bandages, etc.), tradeskill components and 
the needs of my guildmates.

The purpose of this ruleset isn't to take us back to the old school way 
of playing EQ pre-Kunark. It's to eliminate the factors that tend to 
cause people to leapfrog content, to artificially develop their 
characters through simple purchase.
