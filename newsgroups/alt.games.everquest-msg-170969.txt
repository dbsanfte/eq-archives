I'm sorry, I just had to reply to this.  Sanjian, I have a great idea.
Since there are beginning to be a good number of Buddhists in America, I
think we should begin every school day across America with a Buddhist prayer
and meditation.  What do you think?  Or Hindu, perhaps, or Muslim?  Both
religions that are quite popular in America.  Or maybe, since you're
evidently Christian, it would be more acceptable to you to hear Mormon
prayers?  No?
