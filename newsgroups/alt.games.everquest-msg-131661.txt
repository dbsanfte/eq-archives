 Yeah but you don't really need to train them all to level 3. Finishing
Blow for example. Anything more than the first 2 points is a waste. Save
10 alt-dings there! Regen is nice. But 6 alt-dings is too expensive,
imo, for another point of regen. Double-riposte. Not sure that's overly
useful either. Fear Resistance? Anyone actually training that? That's
the only Archetype ability I didn't train. Metabolism is currently
broken. Bandage Wound. Actually I'm not sure what that does. Probably
not needed if you have a Velious BP with invigorate. And of course,
things like wis and int. Maybe train the higher one if you do
tradeskills a lot. Lung Capacity isn't much needed. Whole lot of ways to
save!

 As a monk I could probably train the useful skills for only 100
alt-dings. 100 alt points is still a bit of work though!
