Aha, I just looked at the map at EQAtlas, and it makes sense now.  I've 
generally seen D2 referred to as Comm, though it's very, very rare that 
it's camped.  I've not spent that much time in Sebilis though, and 
probably 50% of my total time there has been Trak runs.  
Hmmm, I sometimes forget how big some of these dungeons are.  Reminds me 
of when I first went to the live side of Guk.  I knew it existed, just 
didn't know how extensive it really was.
