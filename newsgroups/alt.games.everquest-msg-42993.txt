| I don't know much about airlans (wireless broadband connections), but as
long as
| you are getting decent "ping" times (no such thing as lag times), you
should be
| ok. Your biggest problems will likely revolve around your system specs, if
they
| are anythign less than the recommended (not the minimum which are a joke),
and
| how much space you have for virtual memory, hwo fragmented your hard drive
is,
| etc.
|
| IMNSHO Norton SpeedDisk (part of Symantec Norton System Works 2001) is the
best
| thing you can buy (short of RAM on a system with insufficient amounts) for
| improving your EQ experience, as it does an exemplary job of defragging
your HD
| *and* sticks your virtual memory file in a contiguous space at the
beginning of
| your hard drive (you *are* using a fixed size swap file, aren't you?)

And even on my system with 256mb of ram, I set the swap file to a starting
size of 512mb - then let Norton Speed Disk move it to the front of the disk,
applications second, and everything else behind it.  PB is right, Speed Disk
is a huge performance booster on many systems.  Heck, and I don't even work
for Symantec and I'm pitchin the silly software.
