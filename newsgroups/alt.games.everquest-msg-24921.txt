See if you can pick up a:
Cloak of the Ry'Gorr Oracles  +6 AC +2 Wis +2 Int +5 vsMg +10 vsCold +10 Mana   Crystal
Caverns  39
These are pretty cheap these days. Damn nice cloak as well.

Check out the Temple of Sol Ro quests for this item:
Incandescent Mask  +3 AC +5 Int +7 Cha   Temple of Solusek Ro  30

> feet: polished stone anklet (2) - camp (field of bone/burynai cutter)

Might want to think about:
Wolf Fur Slippers  +2 AC +7 Agi +20 Mana   Permafrost

Especially if you pick an Erudite Enchanter because they start with
70 agility and you want to get that over 75 for the boost to AC.
Also while camping the scryer you will get an Ice crystal staff which
is a nice weapon for your chanter to use.

I'd do the Velium Jade rings.

> hands: impskin gloves (5) - buy or camp (sol a/kindle)
> head: runed circlet (4) - buy, or nightshade wreath (5) - camp (mistmoore/maid

> neck: sapphire platinum (7) or velium (8) necklace - buy
> shoulder: embroidered black cape (0) - buy
> waist: braided cinch cord (4) - buy
> wrists: golden cat eye bracelet x2 (0)

I'd do the Gold Jade Bracelets.
But I'd get the ones above and use them when charming and
buying and selling.

All looks pretty good.
