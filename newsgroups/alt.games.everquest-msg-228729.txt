Sony retains ownership of all ingame items and money.  They are 
advertising that they will give you plat in game in exchange for RL cash.  
They do that, there is no false advertising.  It is against the TOS, and 
the accounts involved should be banned/warned/whatever.  The only person 
who could possibly have any legal remedy would be Sony, and that would be 
strictly civil, not criminal.
