There is definitely a special mob slot in S. Ro.  I spent a day checking out
one of the AC theories, and that theory included a list of about a dozen
rare mobs and a few common ones that were claimed to all be in the same
spawn set.  Sure enough, there was exactly one of the rares up, and killing
it usually produced another rare within a few minutes.  On those occasions
when it did not, at the time a rare should have spawned, one of the commons
spawned (or a group of them spawned), and killing those brought back the
rares.

Note that I was not able to verify the claim that the AC is one of these
rares.  The S. Ro rare cycle might be unrelated to the AC.

AoE works in other zones where I've found mobs below the world.  Pets can
melee mobs below the world, too.

I've seen ShowEQ logs of S. Ro spawns, and noticed the same thing.  Of the
20 or so SG spawns in the logs I saw, no two were at the same place.

Those are on the rare spawn table I mentioned above.
