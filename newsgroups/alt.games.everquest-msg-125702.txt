Not sure on this one...everything in Alchemy (potions, anyways)
and Make Poison are "consumable" by the fact that they're used
up.  Like drinking a SoW potion or making Mind Melt (Triv 209)
to sell for quests.

Heck, many of the top rogue poisons aren't trivial at 250 just like
jewelry and other trade skills.  I do admit I have trouble thinking
up a suitable "trophy" for the skills, but I am still upset that every
trade skill up to and including a gnome-only one got their own
TS trophies.
