Well, after a very long layoff due to surgery, I recently started
playing again. Yesterday was a real strange day. A real roller coaster
ride of emotions. A level 65 Shaman paid Zarxx the princely sum of
500+pp for purchasing 3 spells in The Overthere. I bounced up to the
bazaar to shop, of course, and bought Gwydonn a shield and a range item.
Happiness turned to disappointment when I discovered I had overlooked
one tiny item. Gwydonn was only 19 at the time and The Indescent Turepta
Shell has a level requirement. That will teach me for taking time off! I
now have an item in the bank that will stare back at me for a long time,
reminding me of my stupidity at every visit. 390pp worth of stupidity!

I ran back to Butcherblock to hack some Goblins in frustration and ran
into what I now know is the 5th anniversary skeleton army. My butt was
terribly singed, but I made it to Dagnor's just in time and with enough
mana left to save my sorry soul. On zoning back into Butcherblock, I met
a Paladin and started to chat. He told me to meet an alt of his in
Felwithe which I did. A short while later, and after a lot of work on
his part, I was the very proud owner of a set of Imbued Koada'Dal
Mithral armour, along with several other items. All I can say is WOW!
People sure are nice on Drinal!

Gwydonn is 20 now with an INT of 210. His newbie quest armour is
consigned to the bank. I just can't bring myself to destroy it after the
patience required to complete it.

So, that was my day in EQ. Up, then down, then on top of the world. I
can hardly wait until the day I can "bushwhack" a low level with this
set once an eventual upgrade occurs!
