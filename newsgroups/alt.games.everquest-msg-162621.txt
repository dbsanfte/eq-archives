Well as I said, a guild needed a cleric to help with the project and I
was LFG.  But I don't really know any of them, nor do I speak Korean, so
I have only really done things with them like this; special project where
its worth getting past the language barrier.  We don't hang out together.

How it works is, you get a flag in PoT in one of the weaver buildings by
talking to a lady there.  Then you go in with three full and meaty groups
to PoN, near the hedge exit.  Inside that square of hedge is an erudite
in white robes.  Talk to him to start the trial, which is limited to
three groups.  Like the trials in PoJ, this transports you to a seperate
location in the zone for the fight.

Now you follow this guy around a long hedge maze, and he occaisionally
stops to fight a mob.  You help, and when the mob dies, you spawn the
real fight, which starts with one mob, next time two, next three, so on
up to seven mobs.  These mobs are all strictly melee as far as I could
see, and were susceptible to spells, so everyone can be useful.  As usual
for PoP, they have high damage output and reasonably low HP.

Assuming you manage to get all the way thru to the center of the maze,
you kill four mobs, one in each corner around the center fountain, and
then spawn a boss mob.  He's really not all that much harder than the
rest, if you've made it this far, he's cake.  Now everyone hails the
quest guy and gets flagged for Terris Thule.. who also shows up, causing
heart attacks amongst your OOM and heavily injured and utterly unready
crew... but she's not there to play, just to show you what you are
supposed to go kill.

The problem with this escort duty is, oddly, not the guy you are
escorting, who is level 55 and pretty mean, he can tank the odd mob for a
while without incurring major damage.  Its the stuff you are fighting,
which is beefed up versions of the regular PoN crew, more HP more damage
and more of them.  Not unsolvable, but they eat mana up like candy, and
of course slows and failed mezzes aggro onto your casters, while the
relatively early heals translate to massive aggro onto your healers.
Again, not unsolvable... except that the solutions end up costing a LOT
of mana, and the guy keeps moving along triggering the next fight without
giving you time to med back up.

The first time I tried this flag we were out of mana and options by the
time we got to the 5 spawn.

So what these guys did was mez the quest guy, med up, then break mez, mem
blur, and off to the next encounter.  Once I figured out what they were
doing, I saved a lot of "heal the chanter" mana by atoning instead of
relying on them getting a mem blur off while he was beating them to a
fine paste.  (did I mention he's 55 and mean?)

With a language in common, this would have been even easier, could time
the atone to go off just after the blow that would wake him up.
