The bank and lfg feature should be bugfixes? No thanks it seperates the ppl
who bought it and not. I still think it's stupid that ppl with hust kunark
can equip velious,pop and luclin weapons/armor that they can use the new
spells. etc. etc. (though i'm glad they ar eusing equip and recommendation
levels now)
The new content is cool on popular servers so many overc(r)amped places that
new zones will be a relief.
