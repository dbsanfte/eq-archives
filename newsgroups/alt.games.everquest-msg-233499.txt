You're only too small if you have less than 2 clerics. Even a complete
heal landing every 5 seconds instead of 10 can make a difference on
success vs failure and is much more efficient than spot healing.

Others covered this pretty well including the use of /tar but I don't
think anyone mentioned the other big trick of the raid cleric. That is,
assist the mob. If no one in your group is taking damage you can
basically chain assist from the mob to whoever it's attacking (hopefully
your mt most of the time) and back to the mob again. This can allow you
to start a heal on a robe wearer who has gained agro before the mob
land's it's first hit, which is often necessary with robe wearers, as by
the time you see their health dropping even your fastest heal may be too
late.
