Well after the adventuring tonight I went to
check my dragon faction with my druid tonight since
I killed a bunch of giants earlier tonight and found it
was WORSE than before.

I had a sinking feeling so I went and ported
around to check my other factions, and you
guessed it, ALL of them got reset AGAIN, back
to their default levels.

I did have a zone crash when I was porting to meet
with a friend in GD tonight and I bet that is when it
happened. Exactly like last time. Last time they
got reset when I was gating in to my bind point in
Thurgadin and I crashed.

Screw it. It is not even worth going through all
that bullshit again trying to get them reset again.
(exchanging 20 emails with Verant, calling, etc.)
Especially if it is going to happen again. I'll
just deal with it as is.

I'll just play the hack and slash part of the game
and ignore the faction part of the game from now on.
I still have my tradeskills with anyway.

Later,

"nobody likes me any more", *sniff*
