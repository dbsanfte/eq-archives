  At least there is a way to improve your faction with Paineel, and
when you are well-liked in that city, you're well-liked by just about
EVERYONE in that city.  With only a couple exceptions, everyone is on
the "Heretics" faction... all the guards, all the guilds, all the
merchants, ect.

  It's a pretty good deal compared Cabilis, Grobb and Ogguk.  And at
least the outer guards are green.

  So just keep killing kobolds.  As noted, killing the king and other
named kobolds will improve your faction faster.  If you're not yet
strong enough to fight these kobolds on your own, consider asking a
higher level group to let you stand in the corner and take a whack at
the kobolds they're killing for faction.
