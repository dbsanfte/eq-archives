Being I have just completed the Ring War have have my ring, and I have
several things to turn into the Giants, I decided to switch faction. My
faction with the Giants could not get any worst for a long time as well my
faction with the Coldian could not have gotten any better. I spent the
entire weekend grinding out faction by killing Dwarves in Icewall Keep and
GD. 35 Dwarf heads and 1 AA exp point later facion with the Coldain could
not get any worst and I am still Ready to Attack with the Frost Giants. Its
just not fair! I am not expecting extremes but I should at least be dubious
going from full Ally to could not get any worst. Am I asking too much?
BTW as a side note 1 Royal Frosted Coif, 2 RF Bracers, 3 or 4 RF Arms,
untold number of Boots and Guants dropped. Also I just found out the Dwarves
are a sick lot for the 8th Coldain prayer Shawl you need a complete set of
Royal Frosted Armor which you have to kill the Dwarves to get.
