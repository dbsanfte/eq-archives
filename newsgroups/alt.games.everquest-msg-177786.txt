Nope been in software development since the late 70s off and on. Heh
besides anyone that cant see how fucked up this shit was is a moron. I
dont blame the staff its the management that says when shit goes live
before its ready. And btw Ive seen companys use customers to test next
generation functions without informing them. Always buggy as hell
because its always shoe horned in with little testing. So my theorys
are based on observation and person experience. And yours come
from?.......ahh your ass of course

Ahhh man you take this stuff way too personal not to be an employee.
Yeah there a couple of ya here not hard to spot though. Real players
and customers wouldn't dream of defending this kind of crap. Maybe
some of the other patches but not this one.

The one that gives them the right to my money for playing. See
simpleton, a company's  customers can never really ever be wrong,
first rule of business but how would you know.
