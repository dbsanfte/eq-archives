I have had pretty much the same experience.

I don't seem to have met anyone that has been unpleasant, and after 3yrs on
UO it was a bit of a culture shock. I don't think it has much to do with the
PvP aspect, because the non PvP side of UO abounds with grief players.

I guess it may change when I get to a level where the items and cash are
worth getting snotty over.
