    This is the official rule in EQ as-is - first to engage gets the right
to attempt the kill, anyone else who touches it is killstealing until it is
unengaged. All this coding does is enforce the existing EQ rule, so GM
intervention will never be required in the event of killstealing, just to
enforce "sharing" of spawns.
