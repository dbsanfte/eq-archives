I was in a group the other day, doing primary healing. A bard joined
and immediately asked if he could pull. I said no - we had a good
puller and since I was the only healer, I needed his mana song between
pulls more than his fancy pulling skillz. After 2 minutes, he goes afk
singing mana song and doesn't come back. When an enchanter shouts for
a group, I send her a tell, discreetly confer with group leader, we
boot the bard and get an active member instead. Bard was gone 5
minutes later.

I've gotten used to hyperactive pullers and do my best to heal them
during combat :)
