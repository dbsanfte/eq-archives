Sounds similar to what I did. I originally customized the default UI
to be bearable with the lowest screen resolution, which I used on my
old computer. Smaller buff gems, hotkeys, spell bar, fewer title bars,
and a much more compact inventory screen with all the inventory slots
arranged the way they were in the old UI.
I got rid of the percentage updates on the bars when they made them
default, too - I didn't like them.

I found a workaround - my interface windows have all the buttons, but
some of them are only one pixel inside the border of the window and
therefore don't show up at all :)

No wonder my computer cries at me about being low memory if I switch
servers/characters a couple times during one session. (It also doesn't
like zoning too much, it's been particularly bad since the last patch.
It never got bad enough for me to get a popup about low memory before
that one.)
