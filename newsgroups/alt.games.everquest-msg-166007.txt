I never switched for any of the races. Didn't like the new models at
all. Too "busy", I think, by which I mean they threw too much garbage
onto them that wasn't really necessary. And they stand *really* weird,
with their toes pointed 90 degrees away from one another.

And I really do think there was a different mindset of player who
played ogre and troll with the old goofy models. Different from when I
quit a couple months ago. You could usually count on ogres and trolls
being among the nicest people in the game in the first two years of
EQ. No real differentiation now.
