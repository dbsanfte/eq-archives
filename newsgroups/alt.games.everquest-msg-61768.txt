No you don't.  You read every single post I make.  Your replies prove that.

No, you just entertain the Hell out of me, ron.

 There's nothing I enjoy more than watching you day after day after day,
taking the time to write and proof read your next flame.   You flame like a
pro, this is what you do best, flaming on Usenet.

Heh, ron wtf are you talking about?  Does Usenet make you feel like
somebody?
Christ ron, you need re-evaluate A.G.EQ and the significance you grant it.

Sure, I'll tell you why ron.
I just enjoy watching you over react at the slightest provocation and flame
all to Hell your next victim.

Besides flaming being nearly all that you have to do in your life, it's the
one thing you do best.  I like watching a master at work, and you ron are a
master.

Then it's almost as much fun to see the significance your victim's place on
your opinion, now that's entertainment.

Hats off to you sir!
