Funny thing is, sometimes when someone is in over their heads, and asks 
for help, so you do step in, and kill one or more of the mobs for them, 
they then bitch about you KSing them, they wanted you to heal them, or 
help them kill the mob, but let them get the xp.

Not saying you were doing that at all, certainly not from your 
description of events.  But, it does tend to make some people gunshy 
about helping out at all.
