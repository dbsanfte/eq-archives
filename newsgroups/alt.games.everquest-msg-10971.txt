I think the warrens are a bit unreachable for anyone who cant port or
take the boat to erudin (melee/hybrid Evil races?). 2 weeks ago i
started a SK erudite. Starting city : Paineel. I think the newbie ground
is awesome for the first 4 levels. Then here come The Warrens. I think
its an okay dungeon. Problem is, nobody goes there. Most of the time i
fight there, i see max 4-5 players in the zone. 2 of them are around lvl
8-10. 1 of them is around lvl 4-5 and then you have the casual tourist
in the 20s and up to 60. So i dont think ill waste my time in the
warrens because i can hardly find a groupmate and i cant heal myself.
Kobolds have an awesome aggro range. Trains are everywhere. You can
start a fight and end up with 5 kobolds coming from nowhere (you being
the only one in the zone). I wish i could come with my troll warrior.
Problem is i will have to pay for a port, then explore a bit ...then try
to find someone to port for another 15-20pp. Im pretty sure its the same
thing with kerra island. That whole continent suk a bit too much for us
meleers. Oh i forgot to say we have to get a bind too. Anywhere else is
ok... but Odus...eek. Its too much of a pain i think. Thats my opinion
thought ;) . Anyone have any good experience with Odus in general? :)

Boat! :)
