I have just checked out the updates in the reimbursement policy and have
to say that I am not impressed. It would seem that the general rule is
No reimbursement in 99% of circumstances.
We all spend such a lot of time and money developing our characters,
it's a pity we don't get more help when things go wrong. I have had a
200pp weap go missing during a trade and have been stupid enough to drop
a backback full of 600pp worth of potions and you could say well serve
you right, however, there are circumstances when you have no or little 
control or problems caused by disconnects (not our fault either Verant),
accident or lack of experience where a bit of positive assistance would
help a lot.
We all want to prevent the dishonest from taking advantage but to my
mind this is no way to loook after your customer base. In my experience
the GMs are very helpful and I thank them for that however these are the
rules that they have to abide by. Be very careful!

What do you all think?

Ian
