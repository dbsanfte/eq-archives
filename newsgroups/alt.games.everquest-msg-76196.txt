It's not the XP restoration that matters; it's that they don't have
rez effects.  The main tank could be (short of /disc, I'm not sure if
those are reset on death) back in action immediately.  Or a bane
wizard (or any other caster) back *with mana.*

Yes, they wouldn't be at full mana (or have /disc available, I guess)
but they would be back and at least functional.  That's like adding
another toon to the raid at the same level.  It's a good effect and I
can see why the refresh timer on it is so long.
