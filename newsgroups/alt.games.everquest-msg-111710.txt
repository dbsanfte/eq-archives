Do other servers have a Ragefire list?  Have you had problems with people 
not respecting the list?  I guess it's fair, but an 8-month wait is 
excessive.  Do you have to have all other pieces completed before you get 
on the list, or do clerics put themselves on the list at level 1?
I generally applaud player-designed rotations, but in this case I think 
I'm glad I'm on a server where it's FCFS.  (Though there was an incident 
where we killed Ragefire and a cleric in the zone was rather upset.  We 
showed up to help him kill it when it next spawn.)
