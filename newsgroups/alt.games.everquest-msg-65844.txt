As many people have said you'd get the purchase price....you might even
get a court bollokcing for not simply obtaining a refund first...people
already playing have less of an issue...as other have pointed out the box
says on going improvement occurs so you know it might happen...best you're
gonna get is the refund for unusable time not some damges. 

If you talking advertising issues then Eq website is pretty clear on
current requirements and point of sale is the retailers issue...
