But no D&D Dm would put a good tradeable, sells for lot good item in
said dungeon and make it so that 1 in every x mobs drops one. Again
your not complaining about farming your complaining about the game.
Farming is simply the result of people filling a need. If the above
mentioned DM did make a low level dungeon with good easily obtainable
items the d&D guys would farm too in order to get massive amounts of
loot or trading items, unless of course the quest was timed. I thought
the whole point of these games was to let the player have fun their
way?

Again you complain about the game but none of this has anything to do
with TCC.  TCC will not stop item farmers if the item is good enough
and not no drop. If they wanted to get rid of farming they could do
that by making said items no drop so that is obviously not the reason
for the TCC. The only reason to far greens is phat lewt, the TCC will
not stop that it will only make high levels be extorted by low levels
to get the loot, or it will give them loot better then high levels can
get, which anyway you look at it stinks.

Because why should I? I leveled up thru long long times for certain
reasons. One ws so I could walk relatively unmolested around the world
and the other was so that if I saw some trinket I wanted I could go
get it. How can you not see that limiting what a player can do is bad,
not only from a personal but from a business perspective? It's not
about paying a mid level for an item, we could do that by buying said
item in ECom, it's about being FORCED to buy it instead of getting it
for ourselves, ie from benefitting from the time we spent leveling
this character up.

Nowhere, you can get good loot for your level all over the place. What
you appear to want is access to level 40 loot at level 10 with no
competition from level 30 players. That is just so wrong.

Ahhhhhh he's irritated that the high level is in his zone. How sad for
him. I didn't know there were signs on the zones that required people
beyond a certain level range to ask permission to enter. Why shouldn't
the high level have the right to be in the zone? Heck I thought it was
a privilege of playing to be able to expand your horizons, guess I was
wrong. 

If he's stopping your camp you already have the right of way via the
Play Nice rules, so whats the problem?

I don't know  enough about this camp to argue it one way or another
but it appears he's saying that the AC is in the middle of higher con
social mobs that make soloing anywhere but it unadvisable.

Are they the same rarity of drop?  And even if they are,  your talking
price drops after months of allowing the no decay trickle down economy
to work. Which would happen anyway TCC or not.

Because then they were the only options for that wave of people.
Kunark changed that by giving much more open air mid to high level
content. Content that is easier and safer. So of course people are
going to take the safe route and use it.

Again with telling everyone else how to play. I guess you have your
own Vision(TM). Well Luclins Vision just cost verant my 40 bucks.
