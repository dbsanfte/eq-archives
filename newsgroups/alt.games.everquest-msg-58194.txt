> Well Jazz answered this one well, so i won't bother.

  There still seems to be some debate as to whether or not it's cumulative
or not, but I guess it doesn't matter.  I'll just hammer the button to build
skill and then do my own experiments from there. :)

  I see. Yes, your formula is correct, up to level 50... it changes after
that.  So HT doesn't have a "skill number" and is seldom resisted against
mobs one is likely to be hunting, unless they have high MR for their level.
:)  That's what I wanted to know.

  Actually, I think you can skip the part of the epic quest that requires
you to hand in the Darkforge and platinum to that one NPC.  However, one of
the reasons I want to play a shadow knight is so I can try to acquire some
nice equipment (like Darkforge) and feel like I'm benefiting from it.  I had
some of the better pre-planar gear with my druid character, but never really
felt like I was getting much use out of it, and I still looked like a level
7 ranger. :)  So I'll probably try Cazic, though it's a bit lame having to
fight against your own god's minions (or your god Himself) to get your
better gear. :\  Ah well.

  I see, that's what I was generally planning on.  I never had much luck
doing this with my other characters, but that's probably due in part to the
fact that I played soloing classes and got a bulk of my experience alone,
thus made fewer friends and acquaintances than I would have, had I played a
class that needs to group or is more group friendly.  I really want to see
some of the old world dungeons... Najena, Runnyeye, Permafrost, Guk, Temple
of Cazic... through the eye's of somebody actually DOING the dungeon rather
than just passing through, or camping a specific mob.

  Thanks. :)
