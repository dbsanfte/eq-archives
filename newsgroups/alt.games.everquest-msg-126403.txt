I don't know how to post this to verant, but i was thinking about what i
found frustrating about EQ, and what i thought could be done to improve it.
The way auctions of items works, is that you have to have both people
online, adjacent and so on.

 Wouldn't it be better to do it through the bank; setup a reserve price, and
an asking bid, and be able to see what others are offering for the same
item? Make it that the item has to be handed into the "auction house" first,
so that the prices can't be fiddled with too easily?

Personally I loathe auctions; i'd rather be able to comparison shop, view an
item's stats, and so on, and sell my goods the same way. That way, the
market would be healthy, fun, and free of trade scams. Perhaps a graph of
price versus time would be possible; certainly would be interesting to see
how items devalue or remain constant or increase with patches and new
releases and novelty wearing off...

I think that at least some of this would be easy to program. Would anyone
else out there agree that this is a good idea, or is the current system of
running to east commons and shouting for days better? (*g*) (talk about
manipulative questions!)
