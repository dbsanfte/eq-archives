Nah, I wasn't asking for an opinion on what you considered a cloudy or a
case-by-case basis.  I am looking for an age where you will say, "there's no
way in hell that this child should be tried as an adult."

Your post said that you'd have a tough time seeing a 12 yr old tried as an
adult.  That didn't preclude an opinion that you'd have trouble seeing a 14
yr old tried either, but it did seem to imply that you'd have a DAMNED hard
time seeing an 11 yr old child tried as an adult.  Did I misunderstand your
intent?

Or, reworded just using this post, to see if I understand you correctly,
adding or subtracting a word & there to your quote above:

"What I said, and meant, was that [12-yr-olds <or possibly you meant 14, I
don't know>] should be treated differently from say a 9 year old."

That's as close to black & white as I expected anyone to go.  I don't know
if your "man, this is nuts" limit is 10 or 11 but at that's close enough.
