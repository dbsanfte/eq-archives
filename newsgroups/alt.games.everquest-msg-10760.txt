No, you need to go to Befallen, and you must have skill 11
before you can open the door in Befallen. You can only get skill increases
on a door you can actually open, in that case you will always succeed. Don't
put a practice point in until level 11, if you put a point in at 6 you need
to put 5 more in at 11.

On my server (Vazaelle) Befallen is almost always empty, maybe you will have
more luck.

Good luck.
