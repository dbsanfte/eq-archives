Guilt is a marvelous thing ;) on the few occasions I've actually gt
others horribly dead I've paid up to 350pp to get them rezzed when the
damn cleric has said "Whatever you think its worth" and I've had them
ported from EC to Wakening Lands or some other equally hideous long journey.

Honestly, actually, I dont think its greedy either. Im aware clerics get
rich off this. So? Its worth it to me, and as Bizbee shows if its NOT worth
it to you, well, nobodies forcing a rez down your throat with menaces ;)

I have a little druid AND a little enchanter and also have SOW and invis
on my main. I never ever ask for cash for spells, but really, given some
of the tells I get ("Port me" "Who are you?" "Port me to Ec" "Huh?") as
a ranger my pity for the clerics is sufficient to pay whenever they accept
it.

That said almost all the rezzes I get have the offer of payment declined, and
if they accept, well, thats fine too ;)
