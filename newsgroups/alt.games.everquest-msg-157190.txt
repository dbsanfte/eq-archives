Just three days ago I found a Flawless Diamond for sale from a smithing
vendor for 147pp.  Odd since the smithing vendor was on the second floor of
a store in *Qeynos*, not exactly a hotbed for high-end players to sell their
loot.

My guess is that someone was working on smithing and, in the process of
selling the three dozen or so ornate chain tunics they had just created,
accidentally click-sold their Flawless Diamond without realizing it.

Sucks for them, but I felt no qualms at all about buying it from the vendor
and then selling it the bazaar for 3K.  =)  That one find actually funded my
entire effort to get from 90 to 155 in smithing.
