Allright, when I hit 40 I can finally group with my guildies in a meaningful
way (almost all guildmates are 50+). So I would like to get thru these next
5 levels as fast as possible. I am a wizard who enjoys grouping more than
soloing, but not opposed to soloing if I can level faster that way.

I wen't from 35-39 camping the AC in Guk.  It was boring, but fast exp and
decent $$.
