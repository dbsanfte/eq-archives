I levelled 39 in burning wood. Where the path from DL meets the flat ground
is a safe place to pull to/med/bind. If any monster is there its because
someone has pulled it there.
The hornets are immune to fire, and rank ash,cinder,ember and scoriae. ashes
only have about 1500 hp so they sould be takeable solo by you.
Theres still enough blues at 55 to level, tho without tracking youd probably
have to move on to somewhere harder by then.
