   Well, yes, of course.  But this is usenet, and that's not how things are
done around here, bub!

   Best I can figure out, when I said "Thank you, but I'll speak to
whomever I please", Julie figured I was being contrary because I got angry
that she would dare order me about.  She assumed hostility on my part, and
responded in kind.  However, I didn't say it because I was upset.  I said
it because I have a deep dislike for de-facto blacklists, and being asked,
even politely, to join one.   To me, they are kinda a way of saying "We
don't trust you to decide that the person you are speaking with is someone
whom you really don't want to speak to, so we will make that call for
you".  Worse, they can be used as a way to punish someone who doesn't
really deserves it.

  Please note I am not saying that Reg doesn't deserve it, or that he's my
best buddy and pal and I want to chat it up with him for hours on end.  I'm
just saying that I don't like blacklists, and will balk, though not in
anger, when I am asked to join one.

    Here's a funny little story (which I posted on a different group a
long, long time ago and just googled up) that sorta illustrates how I, and
my husband, feel about this sort of thing.  Yeah, it's getting more and
more off-topic in here.  Sorry if the line lengths get chopped up here.

    This post reminded me of an incident that happened a couple of years 
ago.  We were running a Commodore bbs at the time (ah, the memories).  
Anyways, at the time there were about five commie bbs in the area, and 
all the sysops knew and supported one another. 
 
   One of the (married) sysops started sleeping with one of his users, 
who also happened to be married.  He then issued a proclamation banning 
her husband from being on any of the boards.  My husband and I decided 
that this was an inane reason to kick someone off our board, so we didn't 
delete his account.  Because we were the only ones that didn't, the 
husband ended up spending quite a bit of time on our board.  One day, the 
other sysop called us right after the husband had logged out.  He saw his 
name on the last caller log, and immediately called for chat.  When my 
husband answered, he demanded to know why the husband still had an 
account.  To which my husband (god!  I love him so!) said "Hey, I'm not 
going to blacklist someone just because you're fucking his wife!"  The 
other sysop responded by dropping carrier, and then moaning on the other 
boards about what awful people we were.  The funny thing is, as soon as 
the user base heard the story, we became heroes, and the other sysops 
board was boycotted!

   Ah, the commie64 boards.  Usenet is great.  I love playing around it. 
But I sorta miss the old commie boards.  And now I feel old.  /sigh
