You mean there's a ranger out there in the world over level 59 who 
doesn't have EQ/AM3?

/boggle

One of the few classes I'd advise stopping leveling in order to get AA 
which are far more important to them... other than the obligatory stop 
at level 52 for run 3.

59 Ranger with EQ/AM3 > 65 mage with no AA > 59 mage with no AA > 65 
ranger with no AA

Is the way I've often seen it stated in chats

Splendid One, 65 mage with no AA

(no idea where 65 mage with lots of AA would be, hopefully > 59 ranger 
with EQ/AM3 but < 65 ranger with EQ/AM3)
