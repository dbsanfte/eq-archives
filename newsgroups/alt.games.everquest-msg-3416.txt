Thank you, and before reading further allow me to say welcome to AGE.

Its unfortunate, but it is the way the world works. you are judged by
the company you keep, the color of your skin, and the way you dress.

Well, you assertion that you are "the premier flame artist where you
come from"  suggests you have an exalted opinion of yourself, Now,
judging by the rest of FANG that has come here, it wouldn't take much to
be superior to them, although being superior to Rocket Ranger and
GetSumj wouldn't be something I would tell other people as a reference
of my true prowess.  Mostly, because I've met shoe mold that was
superior to the Droopy Duo.

Your Response to Rocket Ranger on the Subject of The best soldiers being
used for the cause of taking over AGE.  Perhaps there was something to
your response I missed.
