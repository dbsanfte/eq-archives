there are two quests that are much easier to do and quicker to go up
in faction for... one is for the Stouts....
this is a one way quest.....
Hardam's goods
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1450
+ House of Stout 
+ Traders of the Haven 

this quest give you faction in both directions...(two way delivery)
Steaon's Deliveries
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=1534
Your faction standing with Traders of the Haven got better. 
Your faction standing with House of Fordel got better. 
Your faction standing with House of Midst got better. 
Your faction standing with House of Stout got better. 
in one direction
and
Your faction standing with Traders of the Haven got better. 
Your faction standing with House of Fordel got better. 
Your faction standing with House of Midst got better. 
Your faction standing with House of Stout got better. 
in the other...

I did these two by going to the guy in the Stout area... bind
there.... get the item  run to Steaons to get his item...
both deliverys are to the Bazaar.... drop off one then the other...(be
sure to pick up the item from one of the guys)  
Gate back start all over....

Luck to you... they love me in shadowhaven
