Have to agree with Crash. My guild is melting away. 5 years out of a
single computer game is a great run, but all are losing interest.
After the last expansion, I was left with the "Nothing new to do"
feeling and just let my account lapse. I'll try EQ2 just hoping all I
read is true and it's not another spank the MoB, get the L3wzt, work
the trade skill. Hate to say it but I have been playing Star Wars
KotOR and have been totally addicted whereas EQ has become a chore to
play.

Been a great run and I have no regrets. I can only hope EQ2 offers
some form of new play that recaptures me once more.
