What do you mean by "solo ability"?  If it means "the ability to solo
in an arbitrary area", then perhaps that order is reasonable, but if
it means "the ability to gain XP at a good rate solo", then that list
is way off.

Rangers, for example, can solo very well once they get their panic
animal spell.  Snare + panic animal + high melee output = fast killing
with little risk and virtually no downtime.  They can only do this in
zones with animals, but there are zones with appropriate animals to
take them all the way to the highest levels.
