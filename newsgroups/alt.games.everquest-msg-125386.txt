Bards do get a song to reduce agro, but not until the mid 50's. You could
try twinking with a symphonic saber, but again I dont think that procs until
50.

Some songs generate more agro than others - its part of a bards growing up
to learn which songs will keep you alive, and which will kill you (depending
on group/party members abilities).

If you get agro, turn off attack for a second. Take a step back, so the monk
is closest to the mob. Do not sing, attack, or even look at the mob funny
until it has switched back to the monk.

I am presuming that you are getting agro after singing one (or more) of the
following - dots, slows, or heal songs. They all get you pretty high on the
hate list. Try to limit your line up to one of each unless you have a
taunter in the group - and even then, just be careful.

Unless you have done a lot of twinking, bards are still pretty fragile at
that age. If all else fails, you always have selos...
