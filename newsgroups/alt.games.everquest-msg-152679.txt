Barb War 54 solo at times in 40s, not often. Boring not difficult. All
this guy can do is hit and kick and run. OMG 3 whole things!!!
Monk 55 solo a lot at current level , boring but not hard. More
weapons than war but not as many as casters.
Rouges lol forget it not interested in the class.
There is a difference between BORING and DIFFICULT. You are expressing
the difficulty of dealing with the boredom if I judge correctly.

Now on the other hand my bard, druid, necro, wizzie can do so many
things I have to chose a strategy for pulling, kiting, rooting,
killing. Bard in particular, if I choose well, mobs drop like flys,
poorly, I get my arse handed to me. Lota fun really. 

Its simple the more weapons at your disposal the more your decisions
affect the outcome. Hence increased difficulty. No classes are really
difficult due to finite options. Pulls with monk can be a challenge in
many areas, and the bard is without a doubt the most demanding and
potentially creative char to solo of any. My god I have to think to
play it. Any lapse of concentration means a lost kill or worse. That's
how I measure difficulty. Not the speed of the xp bar to the right or
the health bar to the left.

Not sure what untwinked means at level 50 , more than leather?
Hmmm duuhh walk into zone find light blue, hit light blue many, many
times. 
Bandage, sit wait. Repeat 500 times a level.
Too hard for me lol

Personally I am not a caster, no matter how hard I try cant root or
snare my boss. Don't know if my cousins have this ability or not.
Otherwise I have no idea what point you are making here. Run out of
ideas?
