I don't mind dying. Its the dying to stupid shit that is not my fault
that really pisses me off. Things like lag, linkdeath, bugs, etc.
I am perfectly willing to accept the risk for my own actions but dying
due to things beyond my control is just a pain.

Unfortunately the game has no way to tell the difference between
the types of death and applies the death penalty across the board.
It is understandable due to the technology involved. But someday
I hope the internet will be more stable and games like this will
have less bugs and this kind of frustration will be kept to a
minimum.
