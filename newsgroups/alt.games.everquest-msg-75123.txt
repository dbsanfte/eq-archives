http://eq.castersrealm.com has a list of all spells and their locations.  If
they can't be bought they tell you what you need to research it.

Quite a few of the Research spells can also be bought.  The important ones
that I can think of that are Research Only are:
16 - Mesmerisation (AE mez)
20 - Color Shift (AE stun)
44 - Shiftless Deeds
49 - Allure (I believe this is Research-only...castersrealm is giving me a
problem at the moment)

Level 44 (I think) also is Tashania which is quest-only but easy if you have
a druid taxi friend.
