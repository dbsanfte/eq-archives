Not the only place it's wrong, see below.

1200 pt heal.  Never, ever trust caster's realm on anything.

And the new OoW one isn't big enough either.  We made a really
good case for bigger heals without the recast and Rytan promised
to look at it.  Doesn't look good though.

/pause 70, /cast 2

maybe a shorter pause so the back off/attack happens right
before the bolt goes off?

Notice that RS's root is a bit better than the old one you're used
to.  A lot of mages yo-yo with it:

Expedience/Velocity pet
/pet attack

as soon as he roots

/pet back off
/pet hold (if you have it, otherwise spam)

repeat when the root fails.

If/When I come back, I think FBoT is going to get more use due to the
new LOS stuff.  It's a pretty dang nice boom.
