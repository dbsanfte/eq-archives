If that child has been exposed to someone with HIV/AIDS and/or has questions
I feel those questions should be answered.

I don't udnerstand why you feel that respecting a child enough to answer
their questions takes the fun out of life. Simply becuase I answer questions
they  may have does not mean that we don't go to the park or the zoo, that
we don't paint and color and play tag and read books and watch videos.  It
simply means that I don't disrespect them by not valuing their questions and
concerns by not answering them.
