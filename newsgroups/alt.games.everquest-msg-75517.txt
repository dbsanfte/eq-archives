It says (though kinda hard to quote) that it does not stack with any other
movement enhancement effects.  It wasn't 100% clear to me whether that
included running at SoW speed if SoW'd, running at Selos speed when
traveling with a bard, etc.

Yes, the WORDING is actually accurate...you don't run at innate+SoW if SoW'd
(at least, you shouldn't be...no idea if it's bugged), but Verant doesn't
exactly have a history of wording things accurately, consistently, and there
was no way in hell I was going to blow my chance at ever being sow'd again
or buying a horse just 'cause I put an AA into Running. :p
