I guess our idea of quad kiting differs
the way i do it with a wizard (or will do once i get my clicky stick) is 
to get the 4 mobs aggroed that way, run around them in circles to get 
them packed together then hit them all at once with bonds of force, then 
use circle of force on them all
The way you described it i dont see as quad kiting
yes your attacking 4 at once but you very unlikely to ever get those all 
together so you can hit them all at once with 1 ae spell
your gonna need to hit them seperately and thats just plain risky
So it seems based on my way druids cant do it properly till 57!
I think a sowed wizard has got to be better at quad kiting then a druid
Im glad i asked this as i started a druid last night. I thought they got 
ae snare in there teens or something but am not sure now if its worth 
bothering with a druid
