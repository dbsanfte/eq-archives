Ahhhhh.......................

So the more elite the better. 

I roxxor joooo......

That's the one thing I don;t like about this game. The sense of
elitism that exists. I'm a 38th and you're only a 37th so you ain't
diddly. My spells are biggerr and badder than you so I deserve more
than you deserve.

If it's so easy to get and so easy to earn then let everybody go out
and earn it. But they don't. They go out and earn experience in other
things like maybe......  being the front line tank so they can hog the
loot...... That's find too if that's the way they want to play. Just
cause they want to play that way does it mean they should get a free
ride at my expense.

And for those who have said to go kill spiders and sell the silk......
I've done that and the amount I got was so pathetic it wasn't worth my
gaming time to do any more. Why??? Well, I suppose some would say that
spider silk is such a low level item and so readily accessable that it
doesn;t warrent a better price. Does that mean I should collect it for
free and give it away if the prospective customer doesn;t want to pay
for it?
