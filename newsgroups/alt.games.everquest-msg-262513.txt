Essentially, you take the loss if you leave the adventure after the 
adventure starts. (ie *anyone* zones in). However, if you leave the 
adventure *before* anyone zones in, you won't take a loss.

Who really cares about taking a loss though? Especially if all it 
usually measures is the fact that 2 people had to bail after accepting 
an adventure? Or that you tried a hard with 3 people and were wiped out 
when a wanderer gated, or the the cleric went LD?
