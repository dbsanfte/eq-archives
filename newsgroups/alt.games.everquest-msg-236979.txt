Both maps are the same imho. And they are correct. What you're missing
is that these maps only show the castle area. So when you zone in you
are looking into a forest. Just head north until you see the castle
wall. Make your way up to the wall. It can be a bit tricky. (Hint: it's
not the visible bridge! *g*)
Once you're on the wall go to the entrance of the castle and your map
will fit.
