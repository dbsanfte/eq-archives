Okay, perhaps you could elaborate a bit? I have obtained access to FG and I
have a quest named "A Foul Wind". When I try to enter FG, I'm met with the
choice between "A Foul Wind" or just FG.

The quest we've been discussing here, with the graves and the shovel and all
that, is "Cleansing", which is somehow obtained by entering the normal FG
instance, right?

Are the two quests in any way interlinked?

If I want to do "A Foul Wind", will everybody in the party need to bring
that quest, or can they help out as long as they're grouped with me?
