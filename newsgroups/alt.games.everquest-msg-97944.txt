No they are not.
A hybrid still needs the same xp to get to level 60, but they now get it
faster when in groups.

Adding a multiplier to the xp you get during hell levels does not change
the amount of xp you need, but does change the amount of effort required
to get it.

VI have not promised that the effort will not change only that the xp
will not change.

Currently the jury is out, but then again if the patch message is
anything to go by then the changes are not live yet anyway.
