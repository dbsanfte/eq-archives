Heh...congrats, Jazz.  It's fun being in two separate
guilds sometimes, too.  Especially when the other
guild isn't as "uber" or "raid-capable" as your main's
guild, and you can log on your fatty (or Assassin)
to go help out.

"Guys, who's that halfling over there pulling the
Ice giants and killing them while we buff?"

"Oh, that's Ali's main...she just was trying to
save us some time because she has to log
early tonight and wanted to help with Vox..."
