Sorry I should have emphasised the sarcasm in my post. Whether you have 
PoP or not, the servers will be up and down like a yoyo after its 
release. You can still get to those daily respawns which are outside of 
the PoP expansion.

Nah not really. I'd rather wait until everybody else has found most of 
the bugs, drawn maps, given advice etc then I will explore.

I'm not intending on buying PoP (mainly because I am going O/S shortly 
and will be unable to play). I am also unsure whether PoP will be 
released in Australia at the same time as the US or as Europe.

I can understand that. I was just being sarcastic about actually being 
able to play when the servers will be so unstable :)
