After installing DirectX 8.1, I ran the Direct 3D test and got an error 
message.  I followed another poster's advice and hit the "Disable Direct 3D" 
button, then tested direct 3D--and it passed!

Now I've got my character set up on the Tholuxe Paells server, but I get an 
error 1018 out of sync message.  Each time, I get a lttle further.  One of 
these days, I'll set foot on Norrath.
