So much so, in fact, that AMD had to redo their processor naming scheme.  A
1GHz AMD was performing like a 1.2GHz Intel.  Most people didn't look at the
benchmarks, though, and simply assumed the Intel was better because the
clock speed was higher.  AMD had to begin listing their chips by their
Intel-equivalent.

Even three or four years ago, when AMD lagged Intel slightly, AMD was the
smart choice- 90% of the performance, for half the price.  Given the
"acceptable" range of computer speeds, I had to seriously question someone
who would pay double the price for something that was only going to be top
of the line for the next three months, tops.
