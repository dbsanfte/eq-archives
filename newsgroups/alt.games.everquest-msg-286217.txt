Welcome back!  I returned from a hiatus recently myself.

If you have the Serpent's Spine (TSS) expansion (the one that
introduced the Drakkin race), check out the quests (tasks, really)
from Scout Madu near the entrance to Goru'kar Mesa.  From PoK, take
the Crescent Reach stone (near the old PoTranquility stone) to
Blightfire Moors, head north across the Goru'kar zone line, and take a
short jog to the left.  These tasks should be doable in the low 50's
or so and give great upgrades.  For example, my low 50's druid and
enchanter both have around 6 points of mana regen (i.e. flowing
thought) from a full set of this quest gear, along with assorted yummy
focus effects (Improved Healing 3, Mana Preservation 3, etc.).  This
stuff completely outclassed everything they were wearing before.  In
general, TSS has lots of quests for great gear for characters of all
levels.

There is some good stuff to be had from Grieg's End at your level
also.  A new named mob in Grieg's End now drops a FT3 earring (Mark of
Lunacy) pretty often.  A nearby named mob drops a Regen2 FT2 earring
for melees, which you can use to perhaps entice someone to come
along.  Assorted named rarely drop legs ( ... of Lunacy) with Spell
Haste 4.  All of these should be available relatively cheaply in the
bazaar, if you don't like Grieg's End, or can't find a group there.

In general, check out the Hot Zones for your level.  Experience in a
"Hot Zone" is given a boost, and new named mobs have been added, with
drops generally similar to the ones that I mentioned for Grieg's End.
Grieg's End was a Hot Zone the last time around; At level 54, the
recommended Hot Zone is now Dranik's Scar.  I don't know what the mobs
there are dropping now.

Also, look up the augments available from the DoN expansion (I'm not
sure when you left, or whether this is news to you).  For 90 crystals,
you can buy an augment that adds +10 to all of your stats.  Depending
on prices for radiant/ebon crystals on your server, this might set you
back only a few thousand plat.  You can also buy augments for various
focus effects, for example.

If you don't have it, get the Kobold Skull charm from an easy quest.
It is now available to everyone, not only those who start new
characters going through Gloomingdeep.

If you left before the Darkhollow expansion, look into the Slipgear's
Gem quests.  Buy two or three SoW potions (Philter of the Wolf) and
levitation potions (Gulon's Impunity?) from the bazaar, and adopt a
level 5 goblin rogue shroud.  You can sneak through everywhere you
need to go for at least 4 of the five zones.  You'll end up with an
augment for your Charm slot that adds +10 to +15 to all stats, and
some AC and saves.  As a level 5 shroud, you gain the added bonus of
dying just like a level 5 character - no equipment or experience
loss.  Happily, a rogue's Hide/Sneak is not level dependent - if it
works, it works even on deep red con mobs.  You may want to use this
trick again to scout out other zones that may be new to you.

I don't have a cleric character, so I can't answer any more specific
questions.  If your main concern is your mana pool, check how much
mana you get per point of wisdom (I don't know the numbers offhand).
Just unequip something, look at how much mana you lose, subtract any
raw mana on the piece, and divide by the wisdom bonus.  You might find
that raw mana is easier to get than mana from increased wisdom,
especially since you're only ~35 points away from the cap.
