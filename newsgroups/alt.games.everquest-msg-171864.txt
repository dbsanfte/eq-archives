It's an amazing bard who can twist 4 songs at once (I'm not even sure that's
possible).  So at the very most he'll take up 4 effect slots...

If all you think a bard is good for is playing manasong then, frankly,
you're a moron.  I played a bard up to lvl 15, not really enough to learn
that much about what he could do, but I've had friends who played bards and
I've learned to appreciate them a good deal... using a bard for manasong and
nothing else is a complete and stupid waste of a good bard.

If all you want is manasong from the bard, and you already have KEI, then
the bard is doing virtually nothing for you.  You might as well get rid of
the bard and fill the space with a class you'll actually use, and let the
bard go find someplace where he can do what he's good at instead of "STFU
and play manasong".  God.
