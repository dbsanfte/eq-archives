Having played a mage to 20 and a necro to 60, I can tell you a few 
differences.

The mage pets each can do different things- the earth pet casts root and 
has more hit points, the fire pet has a damage shield (more direct 
damage, less hit points), the air pet casts stuns, the water pet does 
and ice based DD. Which pet you use will depend on your situation- are 
the mobs you are hunting resistant to one or more of these elements? Is 
rooting to prevent runners a good thing? Is stunning to prevent a caster 
from getting a spell off important? You can, at higher levels, chain 
cast pets. As a mage, you can summon almost anything- and you are a God 
on a corpse run so that no one runs naked. At higher levels, Call of the 
Hero and mod rods and damage bracers are all wonderful useful things. 
Your nukes are simply amazing (second to wizards, i think), and your 
damage shields are fantastic. However, you have no root, and no snare, 
and no way of healing yourself (except summoned bandages).

As a necro, your pet doesn't tank as well. (neither class really has a 
pet designed to solely tank a mob for the entire fight without help). 
Your summoning ingredient is not as easily purchased- it's not typically 
vendor sold. You are a master of long slow painful deaths. You may snare 
(and it does damage), and root at 34 and after. Your lifetaps heal 
yourself, and there are spells that will give your hitpoints to others 
to heal your party. While you will have a few nukes, I think they are 
close to the worst of any caster class. You can deign death first of any 
class, and you will also get Divine Aura (only it's named Harmshield and 
Qivering Veil of Xarn), where you are invulnerable for a short period of 
time. You can ressurect the dead (at a terrible cost), and summon forth 
anyone's corpse. You can Charm and slow the undead. You get an 18 second 
mez. You can give your mana directly to others. You are also hated in 
most communities, and will always have to watch your back. I think 
necros are a little more difficult because there is soo much more 
variety to them. (I keep forgetting I can charm undead, for instance)

I like them both a great deal. They both make great soloers, and benefit 
any group. Whichever one you want to be will depend on your play style.
