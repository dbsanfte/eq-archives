Well, after reading all the others...here's mine...

We think you are Straight
and we are 99.19% confident with our answer
OK, I know what you're thinking. I guessed you were straight, big deal. It's
a safe bet, since the majority of the population is straight. Especially
since people like the guy on the right claim to be straight. If he's
heterosexual, anyone could be. That's what's so great about America.
But hey, I gave it a shot. What do you want me to do, anyhow?

And....They got it right.  At least my wife won't need to worry about me
going off with another guy.  This after I admitted to liking shopping, even.
OK, I only like shopping for cooking supplies and power tools (theyare not
mutually exclusive, btw).
