Bully for you.

Common usage makes it correct.  You remind me of a Quebecois
scientist who had the extremely annoying habit of insisting
that "there is no such thing as a micron".  Only dead languages
are static.  I don't like many of the changes I see, and I even
rail against some of them (like the one we're discussing), but
I'm neither foolish enough nor young enough to continue forever
trying to out shout the wind.

One of the most annoying and useless bromides of all time.  Not
only is it false, but it's overused to the point of being little
more than the irritating whine of a mosquito in the ear.

True, you can waste your time and effort fighting a cause that's
long lost.  And I can comment on the futility of doing so.  Looks
like there's an opportunity for us to both be happy.

Undoubtedly true.  Not especially relevant to the matter at hand,
but hard to deny never-the-less.
