It gets a bit more complicated than that, it's been a while since I've
seen the test but the longer lasting roots don't check for a break on
every tick, just on certain ones. IE: a 3 minute root will check for
breakage on ticks 1,3,9,15,20 and 25  (numbers are made up).

Agreed.

Easiest way to disprove that is if you have Spirit Call as a shaman. I
root then puppy mez often and if bash or stuns broke root then I could
never keep a mob rooted with 3 puppies beating on it. Those roots are
"seem' just as reliable in lasting the full duration . A proc stun
might but the regular melee variety doesn't seem to.
