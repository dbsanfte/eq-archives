Several people asked what the purpose of this would be.

The idea would not be to prevent farming, really, nice as that side 
effect might be.

It would be to prevent people from easily acquiring gear beyond their level.

It would be to restore the phenomenum where you spend your time at each 
level not just getting experience, but getting gear upgrades, not by 
farming sellables and saving up to buy stuff from the bazaar, but by 
killing mobs that drop things you can use.

And it would put you in groups of like geared people, so that challenges 
would be based on going after stuff really appropriate for you level, 
and on your tactics and strategies for using the tools you have, rather 
than just bludgeoning your way thru anything you face by virtue of 
outlandishly good gear on the part of 3/4ths the group.

I don't know that it would be great, I'm just curious.

I was suprised at how well the reverse idea, the "all droppable" FV 
server worked; perhaps I'd be equally suprised at how poorly this 
seemingly simple plan would work out.
