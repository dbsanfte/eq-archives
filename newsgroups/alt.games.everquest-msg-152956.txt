It's too bad you KFed me ( if you really have)
I was going to blast your ass with stats and a few posts
you made under different threads where under one thread you
say one thing then under another you say something completely
different. It's no wonder you "plonked" me.
With all the posts you make in here, I guess it's hard to remember
when you stick your foot in your mouth.
