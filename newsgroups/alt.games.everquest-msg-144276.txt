Wrong.

My desktop resolution is 1152x864 and my game resolution is
800x600.  I get the stuck cursor, too.  Cycling between resolutions
used to fix it for me.  Since the last patch, cycling between
resolutions crashes EQ.

I guess I've gotten used to the stuck cursor.  Verant does not
seem motivated to fix it.  Live with it.
