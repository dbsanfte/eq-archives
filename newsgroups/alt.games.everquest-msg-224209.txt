    That particular PP is really fussy about where you are when you hail
him. I think it might be some sort of Z-axis issue. We've had one person
whose twink was in raid, swam up, hailed - nothing. And then the PP depopped
before he got a second chance to hail.

    On our first kill, I had guildmembers offering cash to be ressed first
so they could get one of the limited number of flags. You think healing is
stressful? Imagine being one of the few clerics alive after that first kill,
you tell the raid channel to send direct tells to you for a res, and your
chat box is suddenly filled with more pleas than God gets in a month.

    You'll do the gods again, and again, and you'll get spare shields. I
have a full set again, even with a three guild Coirnav rotation.

    You're not in a tiny zone. You're in a room underneath the Factory in
Innovation. And yeah, seeing the clocks and stuff is pretty neat.

    If they're in the middle of something, you can't click over into the
raid area. You have to be part of their raid (and specifically, their
"instance" of Time) to click over. Where you went was the graveyard, reached
from the tombstone with the red eyes in the center area.

    You got it. Anyone in a raid can start an "instance", and once you do it
takes a minimum of one hour for it to pass and someone else to get in. You
could block them and mess with them a lot.

    You're telling me. I have 266 AA's, and just recently completed what I
consider my "essential" AA's. I have maybe 24 points in stuff that most
clerics wouldn't want to get, so that's 242 points of core stuff. And I
don't have things that other clerics value, like Bestow Divine Aura, Divine
Res, or Divine Arbitration.

    If you ever wanted to twink someone up fast, now is the time. As of at
least last patch, recommended level weapons are buggy. They display a low
DAM, but they hit as if they have the full DAM value. Giving a low level PAL
or SK twink one of those 50 pp 20/22 Glacierbone Hammers is a quick way to
get them up in level. ;-)

    I keep it on myself constantly. I put it up on group members when I join
a group, and refresh it on members now and then. During our serious boss
encounters, we chain it on the MT. Turning what would be a damage spike for
10000 into a damage spike for 9000 on a MT turns a near-certain death into
something that can be survived.

    If you have a sturdy knight, have them tank the fake sons. They can lock
aggro on them very, very well, which is usually the problem when fighting
those two.

    I bet they're not upset about what you're upset about. For example, the
ones that are pissed about killing the trigger and leaving? I bet more of
them are pissed that the guild let a loot mob poof than are pissed about
deliberately blocking your guild.

    Bad plan.

    A happy ending. I didn't see that coming!

    Always use knights if they're available. I find I can keep pretty much
any knight in the guild alive, and I'm always the first OT cleric. Having a
shaman in group to help with cures and heals is important.

    AoE is chump. Have a bard or someone kite him around until you're ready,
then bring him in and kill him off.

    Why? Sure, it has better HP/MANA. But the focus is something you already
have (already have twice, in your case), the 35 ATK is totally wasted on
you, and the resists are terribly unbalanced (although PR is tough to find).
Let someone like a knight have it, as they don't get a good shot at
Preservation of Xegony until Time, and try for something else.

    Every day you go to Time, you'll get five drops from phase I. The guild
will soon be swimming in those drops, and will likely give them out via
/random or other policy which doesn't impact on points. Look at the items
you can use from there, and decide now if any of them interest you. They
are:

http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28668
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=9444
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=28655
http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=25844

    The fifth is a melee ring which you cannot use. There's five trials,
each drops one item randomly from the five available.

    You should have stayed online, if only to listen in on what they find
out. Steep learning curve ahead, and you don't want to be at the bottom of
it when others are near the top. Especially as it sounds like your guild has
more than 72 raiders, which means some people will be left out when you are
in Time (72 person limit, most guilds only use 54 people for the first
phase).
