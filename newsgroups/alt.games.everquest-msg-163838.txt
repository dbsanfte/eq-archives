I doubt it.

Got more text from the crusaders.

[Tue Nov 19 23:36:30 2002] Dardori says, 'Hail, Susarrak the Crusader'
[Tue Nov 19 23:36:30 2002] Susarrak the Crusader extends his long neck and
lowers his maw downward to look upon you. Suddenly, a hushed and beautiful
voice whispers with a powerful dominion in your thoughts, 'You stand before
Susarrak, Crusader of Veeshan and keeper of all that is of the arcane and
faith within our order. I sense the loyalty you bear toward the children of
scale is strong still. However, the siren voice that has called you to us is
still a whisper upon your mind, and it is a song of curiosity and greed.
Since the dawn of your creation, all of your kind has proven that without
tangible reward, you would otherwise slay us. But do not think we fault you
for merely this -- such shallow lusts have come to be expected from your
kind. However, the [champions] are not as the others of Veeshan's brood and
your past deeds shall [not bear fruitful] in your dealings with us. '

[Tue Nov 19 23:36:36 2002] Dardori says, 'Who are the ancients?'
[Tue Nov 19 23:36:36 2002] Susarrak the Crusader gives another bellowing
roar, his wings flaring outward in an intimidating and almost frightful
display, 'The Ancients are not to be trifled with, Dardori! You ask for
their [names], for their past and for their meaning to this perilous path
that you have set us upon, and your actions have earned you nothing less
than the obligation to know the fullest extent of what you have unleashed
upon this world. But do not take these words lightly, nor think yourself a
hero standing in the fading shadow of a great monster. Although those of you
whom still bear allegiance to the Claws of Veeshan will be asked by the
Crusaders to engage these monstrosities of Veeshan's brood, you shall gain
neither repute nor true victory if you succeed in such a task -- you may
gain some favor in our eyes and perhaps an eye to separate you from those of
your kind that have betrayed all of this world.'
[Tue Nov 19 23:37:02 2002] You say, 'what new role'
[Tue Nov 19 23:37:03 2002] Susarrak the Crusader says ''When Kerafyrm was
awoken, the apprentices were called by the council to prepare for the hunt
and his recapture. When all was said and done, the apprentices were not as
agreeable to the council's plan as was expected, for obedience was a lesson
thought to be instinct molded to their breeding. For months the
deliberations and cordial arguments raged, but all that would eventually
come would be the unspoken disapproval of the council and the apprentices'
self-imposed adoption of a new and more necessary duty. The Crusaders of
Veeshan were born upon the very steps of the council's sacred hall and in
respectful defiance, we have come to Skyshrine to fulfill our purpose.
However, those passing months ushered in an unseen darkness that the
Crusaders had feared from the first movement of Kerafyrm's eye -- the
[ancients] returned.''
[Tue Nov 19 23:37:11 2002] Dardori says, 'What are their names?'
[Tue Nov 19 23:37:11 2002] Susarrak the Crusader says ''When Kerafyrm had
proven his mad, relentless nature that opposed all we had established since
the dawn of our existence, the elder council of the Claws of Veeshan ordered
Kerafyrm's destruction as an absolute necessity to escape existence as
slaves to the tyranny of a mad abomination. During this time, Kerafyrm had
established allies within the Velious nation -- amongst these allies were
four elders upon the very council that sought to destroy him. Kildrukaun,
the former Arch Priest of Veeshan and driving force behind the original
decree that forbade the existence of creatures such as Kerafyrm was the
first to betray the Claws of Veeshan. Vyskudra, the magnificent dragon of
the storms and only one of her kind to exist followed the lead of her patron
and master. Third was Tjudawos, a scholar within the council and one who was
swayed not without much debate from Kildrukaun, but the Arch Priest's sound
argument would seduce the brilliant master of the arcane to their side.
Lastly was Zeixshi-Kar, the general a'
