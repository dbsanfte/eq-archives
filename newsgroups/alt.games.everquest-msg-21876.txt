"""Did I miss something or is there another
 way to make payment that I may have over looked."""

I used my check card, and if yours is like mine, it should have either a
Visa or MC symbol on it, as well as an expiration date.
Just hit the account button, and enter the info as if your card was a credit
card.

If your check card does not have a Visa or MC logo, check with your bank. My
ATM card did double as a debit card, but I had to apply for a new card to
get the check/debit card. And it's got my picture on it too. So wear a clean
shirt when you go to the bank.....................
