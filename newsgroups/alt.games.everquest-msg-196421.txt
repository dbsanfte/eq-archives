People are going to hunt where the balance between productivity and risk 
is the best or where the loot outweighs higher risk, period. KEI lowers 
some of that risk. If risk is lower, your trek up through the levels is 
easier.

That is a good bit of conjecture on your part. I disagree that it's that 
simple a conclusion to draw.

Nope. Why would I have? That didn't change game dynamics nearly as much 
as KEI has. That's just a bad comparison.
