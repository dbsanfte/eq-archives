 One or two in Veeshans Peak I think. Forgot which one(s)..  For the
most part though you don't need to worry about charm. Fear does stink
though. I hate being Dragon Feared.

 Klandicar. Or Zlandicar. Whichever is in DN I can never remember.

 Vrown of King tranix is good on the MR side. +20

 It's good to have to but I'd put the focus on MR over elemental resist.
Obviously both are preferred but if you have to skimp on one to get the
other, I'd say always go with MR.

 I don't remember any of the dragons in WW fearing. Klandicar does I
think, actually. Not sure about Sont since I didn't last long.

 Good advice. A lot of people overlook this.


 From my experience I'd rank resistance gear in the following order:

Magic
Fire
Cold
Disease
Poison

 There's probably more Poison based dragons than Disease but as you
said, PR is pretty easy to get up especially with DMF available.
