    No, they had not. If they were pulling that boss, they had not cleared
the "hard" mobs in the zone. They were trying to take a shortcut to the mobs
with the best loot in the zone.

    If they had CotH set up properly in the mob in question's room, they
would have done it. They need to CotH up to that room ANYWAYS to get to the
later bosses. I'd guess they either didn't have CotH set up in the right
place in the room, or don't realize that there are spots in that room where
one can CotH safely.

    As for the Dain fight, the only reason you warp the Dain down into the
ice caves is there's no place you can physically get him to follow you down
into the caves, like a staircase. So choosing to fight him in the caves (and
as the GM noted it's the logical place to fight him, given the banish
ability) requires one to warp him. In the VT case, the only reason to choose
to fight the boss they did in the place they did is to try and avoid going
through the other mobs in the zone in order.
