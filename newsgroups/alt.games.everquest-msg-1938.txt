There are WAY too many places to hunt at just about every level to even
consider sharing a camp location.  This not only has the possibility of
creating social conflicts, but it is also a major impediment to xp gain.
It's definitely not worth it, the world of Norrath is just too big to even
get into a camp dispute.
