They are an uncommon loot on a rare spawn.

If you are a Druid, the key is tracking, wolfform, and patience (and maybe 
another character)

The ghasts only spawn at night. Any you see during the day are leftovers. 
So, hunt all EQnight, at dawn run a roundup, then sit down(at a zone line 
of course), camp out, and play another char for a bit. Then, when night 
falls again, go out a-ghast giggin'
