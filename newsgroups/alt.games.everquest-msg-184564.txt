Yes, and I can probably dig up articles about how people did similar
to their kids over disturbing their TV or even reading. It proves
absolutely nothing except that the parents weren't fit to be parents
(or even human beings, but that's another story). The fact the guy was
playing EQ specificly is coincidence and irrelevant.

Certain sects of people *want* to blame TV, video games, and movies
for all the evil in the world. It's more convenient to beleive that
the "technology monster" is behind it than it is to beleive that
humans can be capable of such awful behavior on their own. I guess
they forget that our history is full of atrocities committed by
average joes even before electricity was harnessed. Of course, back
then, they liked to blame it on witchcraft and satanic possession...
