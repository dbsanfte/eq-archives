Curious though, do you have to run EQ at a lower setting of any type using
this program?  I would be interested in using it if I could still run at the
same basic settings I am now.

Athlon 1800 XP
512 DDR RAM
GeForce 3 Ti500
Sound Blaster Audigy Platinum
60GB HDD
Cable Modem Connection

I tend to run full models, clip plain around 20 % and full details, except
texture compression.  I drop clip plain down to 0 % and turn off NPC/PC
Names, drop all detail levels to lowest setting turn off spell and grass
effects when I enter the bazaar.  If I can do all of that using EQW I might
just give it a try.  Would be useful for checking on zone maps and quests
mid game.  Thanks.
