Welcome to Everquest. Over the time I've been reading this group I've seen
alot of people with this type of problem. (and had it myself on occasion)
First thisgs first.

1. Update your video and audio drivers. Get the latest, or go to the
Everquest web site and get the ones they suggest for your video and sound
card.

2. Update to the latest version of DirectX. You get that from Microsofts web
site.

3. If those don't work come back here and post, but put your computer
specifications (Processor, RAM, Video, Audio, Etc.), your Operating system,
and how you connect to the internet. More than likely someone with close to
your setup will have had the same problem and come up with a fix.

Good luck,
Naphtoe
