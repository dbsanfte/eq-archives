Well, it's still not perfect as I lost at least one /tell on Test
yesterday, but MOST /tells or /groupsay or whatever sent while you are
zoning show [queued] in front of them on the sender's screen, and the
text is shown to the receiver when they are done zoning.

Also, when you zone the screen does sort of a wierd slideshow effect
for a few frames and the text doesn't get all garbled/doubled like it
used to.
