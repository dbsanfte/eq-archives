I don't know if it is server side or client side, but zoom spells raise the
radius.  I have a right-click insta-cast mask with a zoom spell, and it is
very useful in open zones, and the effect is very noticable.  A good place
to play with this kind of thing is near th Walrus field in the SW part of
Eastern Wastes.

You can also see the text over mob and player heads from farther away with a
zoom spell in effect.
