Yeah I got and played for a few weeks.
Basically I just found it dull. There didn't seem much to do, and there
seemed to be little going on in the world. I think the chat system (They
don't really have anything like /shout or /ooc) just made the place seem
deserted.

And the world is very small. About the size of one or two of the larger
everquest zones. I just got bored very quickly. But it does look nice!
