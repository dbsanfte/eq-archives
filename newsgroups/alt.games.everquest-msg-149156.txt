Well I only raid with my guild, almost never pickups, (sometimes help other
guilds out but i try not to judge people then).. so I dont really see
incompetent and stupid people.

If they were.. well they would be asked to leave and TL'd out.. non-guild
people who wont leave your area (faction leaches) and train shit like
AoW/Idol on you.. well not much you can do, petition and shitlist them.

EQ doesnt have pre-made characters though, so go find something out there
that exists and is more to your liking.

No, but spending real life cash in a game does.
