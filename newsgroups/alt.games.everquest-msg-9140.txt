Thanks for the responses.

However, hmmm. I think maybe I wasn't clear. I'm auto-attacking. Not
throwing or hotkeying anything. But I have a spear equipped in my range slot
(didn't mean to, I looted and it went there). So anyway, I hit autoattack
and, as usual, my melee weapon grays out then comes back, and continues the
cycle. Range weapon also grays out. I just realized I'm not sure it's
cycling, but what is it doing? Why does Range Weapon gray out on
auto-attack? My concern would be that I'm alternating hits: First with melee
then with range weapon in offhand. If so, I'm losing the advantage of my
very nice prime hand weapon, which would be bad, and I would make a
concerted effort to keep the Range slot empty.

Or, is this just a game artifact without any meaning and I'm worrying
needlessly?

Thanks.

John
