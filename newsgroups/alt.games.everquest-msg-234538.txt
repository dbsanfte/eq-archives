I totally agree.  My cleric is usually group leader, and I am really torn on
this debate.  I usually have at least a few friends in every group.  They help
find other players to join us.  They help decide who is going to be MT and ST
and which LDON we are going to do.  We all have input on finding crowd control
and nukers, ML, etc.  
You know what gets dumped on me the most:  Which LDON we should do since we all
agree its NOT going to be *another* BB or a GUK because guk sucks?  So thats
the biggest decision I make.
Extra points for leadership?  Very very hard to call, shouldn't always be the
GL. 
I don't like the idea.
