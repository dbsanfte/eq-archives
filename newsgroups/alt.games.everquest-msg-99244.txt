Somewhere there was a link to the dev forums that stated that just because
druids have superior abilitys for the first 50 levels of life, doesn't mean
that they should get screwed over in the last 10, but thankfully due to
EZboard's utterly ganked search feature, I can't find it.  But anyways, I do
understand what you're saying.

My main problem with raids is that my guild has a gimp druid that drags
people off to do stuff, but of course that burns them out on whatever it is,
and so I'm stuck without it for a while(CoM raids, corrupteds that I can't
solo or duo with a warrior friend, etc.), thus reiterating the reason that I
don't like most assling (male) druids.

Then again, he isn't the worst druid on the server, I still can't figure out
how a level 43 druid died camping the mammoth hide cloak guy.
