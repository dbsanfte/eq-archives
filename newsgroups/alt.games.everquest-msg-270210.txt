Mine got it about three days ago. I'd like to go back to DAoC - the new
models look a bit better to me. Only problem is I don't know what's been
added that's new. I might try WoW if I get solvent again.

This was my wife's gamekiller. It really does break immersion when she has
to ask *which* Antonica or *which* Oakmyst I'm in. Same for me to a lesser
extent. I really do think they've gone overboard on the instancing.

I wish they'd have done something along the lines of DAoC in this respect.
Give the helper some experience (outside of the encounters experience) but
not let them take the whole encounter (killstealing). I just picture all
the avatars running around in EQ2 with full body condoms. Don't interact
too much with your fellow players you might get some of their experience. I
know they implemented it to combat PLing but to me it just takes away from
the game.

And you gotta love the pickup groups where it is leader only to break the
encounter. That can be abused just as well as anything else. Woe be to the
GL who breaks an encounter that is winnable (even though to them it might
look otherwise). Or the one who breaks it just for spite.

It's out there. They're funneling you into the quests to advance. That's
fine except that (IMO) the majority of quests that give you any goodly
amount of experience would require a group to complete. Or if you did them
solo you'd have to be several levels higher than optimal and get a lesser
reward anyway. I would like the option of the quest giver telling me, "Hey,
this mission I'm going to give you might be a bit much for you. You're
going to need friends. Still want to take it?".

When I get real bored, I like to drive down town and get a great parking
spot, then sit in my car and count how many people ask me if I'm leaving.
