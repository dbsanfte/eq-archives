I agree that Temp on a level 1 is absurd; it's one of the many
cases of an effect that ought not to work on targets below a
certain level.  (They added a minimum level to KEI, why did they
leave Temp unchanged? /boggle)  But the fact that they didn't
do the job properly in EQ1 doesn't mean that the overall approach
is wrong; I still think it would work to disallow most high level
effects on low level targets (possibly automatically downgrading
the effect to that of a level-suitable weaker spell).

The other KEI issue is different: the content at higher levels is
often tuned to assume that you have level-appropriate buffs, so if
you don't have them you're at a severe disadvantage.  Now, there
ought to be a choice of buffs; e.g., the tank needs more HP/AC to
face high level content, but it shouldn't have to be Temp or
Virtue or whatever, but might instead be any of a number of HP/AC
buffs from a variety of classes.  KEI is awkward because it's such
a great buff and there's not a lot of choices that come close.
And I agree it's a problem when Enchanters aren't wanted in groups
because people can get KEI and/or Haste in PoK and then use the
group slots for other classes.  I haven't played a lot at those
levels (and neither of my casters has gotten that high yet), but
I do wonder whether the duration on the buffs is part of the
problem.  If KEI had to be recast every 50-70 minutes instead of
lasting over 3 hours, people might be more interested in having
the enchanter around to refresh it.  (Obviously the mana cost
might need to be reduced.)
