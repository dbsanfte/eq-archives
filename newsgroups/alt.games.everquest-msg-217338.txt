If each of your points is disproved by someone, then no single
person needs to disprove them all.  False is false no matter who
disproves it.

This isn't to say they HAVE been disproved, its just an attack on
your theory that since no one person has disproved every single
one of your points, your entire arguement is unassailable.

If anything, it might be true that if any single one of your
points is proved false your entire arguement collapses like a
house of cards...
