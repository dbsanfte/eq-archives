I'd say look into EQ or DAoC, UO to me was never that fun, I found it
boring.  DAoC just came out and is the newest of the MMORPG's, it's a lot
like EQ but I find it better.  But who knows what EQ: SoL might do for EQ
this Dec.  Your best bet tho is to read up on all 3 and see which you think
you'd enjoy the most, remember UO is the oldest of the 3 and graphics wise
is the worst, and also very outdated.
