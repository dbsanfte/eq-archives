    If you folks want a raid that would be fairly challenging and with good
reward, try the Gnome Quest in Cazic Thule. Just hail the little guy (he's
at the wizard port-in), then follow him around the maze. Every so often bad
lizards will pop - kill them, keep the little guy alive. After about an hour
of wandering, you kill a lizard with a quill on him. Then the gnome walks
back to the port-in, and asks for the quill. Hand it in and you get a random
item, usually an earring. The earrings are great - they're all all/all and
tradeable, and for example the WIS-caster one is AC 5 10 WIS 100 MANA.

    Now, why do I mention something like that? Well, you said you wanted an
ID3 item. The Jungle Spider Cap drops in the maze in CT, and has ID3. And as
we found, when you follow this gnome about and kill whatever pops, you also
end up clearing the maze at the same time - and you can scoop the rare mobs
if they pop. It's also a great "training raid" for ring-style encounters
where offtanking is required. The gnome repops every two hours or so, so you
can really try this a lot if you so desire.
