That's an interesting one, actually.  One of my first lab rotations in the 
Biophysics program at UCDavis was in the lab of a fellow looking at the 
effects of electrical and magnetic fields on the body's healing processes.  
Most of this consisted of observing the movements of certain cells crucial 
to healing (grr... somethingorotherosomes...) under the influence of a 
magnetic or electric field, with a confocal flourescence microscope.  So I 
can say with absolute certainty that these cells -did- in fact move in 
response to an electric field.  

The basic principle here is this.  Our skin sets up a voltage potential 
between the inside and outside of our body.  A small, but measurable one.  
When our skin is broken by an injury, this potential is broken as well, 
which leads to an electric gradient within our body that decreases as you 
move away from the injury.  So at least one, and possibly more, of the 
cells important to repairing injury are capable of sensing that electrical 
gradient and moving along it to find the owie and fix it.

Now, knowing al that, magnetic healig does not seem entirely as far 
fetched as it once did.  As it is practiced, it still seems about as 
likely to work as taking a random drug for a random illness and hoping you 
got the right one, but hey.  That just means we need to get some 
closed-minded skeptics to study it.

}Knock yourself out.  I'll stick with being one of those terrible
}close minded skeptics.  Thanks.  :)

It's much more sensible to be an open-minded skeptic in my personal 
opinion.  You learn so much more.  Otherwise you end up being one of those 
people who feels that t's impossible for a group to function without a 
tank, cleric, and crowd control, despite rampant evidence to the contrary.
