Yep. PC is a good place for experienced players with ubertwinks, who can 
afford to skill up from 25 weaponskill at 35th level while fearkiting a 
snared X...with their twoboxed/guildmate necro, or ranger...or whatever.

For the true newbie, stay the hell away! Its ok to be useless and 
clueless and 12th level... at 35th you should have learned something... 
and thats not going to happen if your sitting with Temperance in a PC 
group with 5 ubertwinks. :)
