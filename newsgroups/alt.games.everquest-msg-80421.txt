I've seen quite a few of those myself, and though I absolutely love the
character of Legolas in LoTR, he wasn't a real ranger -- he was, according
to Tolkien, just a wood elf (not, in itself, a bad thing -- wood elves
seemed to rock in his mind). *Strider* was the ranger... which begs the
question... why aren't there more Strider/Aragorn's running about than the
Legolas's? I've seen that name with every spelling variation there IS. But
not yet a Strider. Of course, I only play on one server, and I wouldn't see
them in any case, except for chance. But I've seen heaven knows how many
variations of Legolas.

No, this has nothing to do with the subject, really... just my 2cp.
