Hmmm, you could get an enduring breath cast on you too.  Bards can do
it, if they have Drums of the Beast.  I know druids can do it, mages
can summon waterstones, etc.  I would think you would have no trouble
getting someone to cast a water-breathing spell on you.  If you have a
fish scale it makes it even more likely.

I'm not sure if they see through sneak/hide.  I do know that they see
through invis.  I honestly can't remember if we have rogues drag
corpses there or feign-deathers.  If you do try to sneak/hide, I would
recommend that you swim all the way to the bottom and try to swim
under the seahorses.....though it may make more sense to swim well
around them towards the waterfall, and then try to come along the wall
in such a way that you never get in front of them.
