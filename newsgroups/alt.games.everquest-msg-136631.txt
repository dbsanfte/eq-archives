OK , I know some of you read my post and think,
" he's full of shit" or " he really doesn't work for Sony",
whatever , I can't prove my employement on usenet, like I said before
I could scan my W2 or paycheck stub but someone would just say it's
photoshop.
But, I'm telling it like it is, I'm not making this shit up out of the
top of my head. I work here, and I can see the choas the last week has
been.Hell, I even told you all "get ready for a ton of patches before
the new UI patch went out, and how many have there been since then.
I told you so but you were all like " yeah right".
And about that 100K online at once, out of all those peps how many
where 2,3 even 4 account holders on different computers. I personally
have 2 computers with 2 accounts. One for play and one for work.
You know I can get into some shit of grief for posting the info I
give, but some of you deserve a little truth.
But I have to say I love the guys that refuse to believe EQ will end.
Some of you don't understand that You really have no say over EQ.
Not anymore anyway.
I was at E3 this year and had to personally show a Sony Exec. the new
releases , all he was interested in was SWG and EQ2. 
I asked him if he was interested in seeing the Planes of Power
demonstration and he said ," No, WE are only interested in how SWG and
EQ2 are developing, looks good. Thanks." and he was gone.
POP is going to be the Last Expansion, no more are planned unless
something major changes in development. And I "personally" mind you,
don't see it happening. By that time I will be on the SWG Team and
away from EQ.
I understand that ome of you have no real idea of "Gaming Economics"
and the cost of developing and mantaining a game like EQ.
Most people think,turn on computer, logon server and play.
And don't even think about the trired bastard on the other end making
sure the server doesn't crash and gets shit on when it does.Or even
the poor GMs that have to wander zone to zone now that they cut back
on staff.

SO when you read something i post, don't just dismiss it as "crap",
read into it a little and maybe you'll see what I'm trying to say.


Forgive them Father for they know not what they play..
