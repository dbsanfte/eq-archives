In that gear,

Earth / Water / Air access,

Manaetic Behemoth - no for logistical reasons
AD - perhaps but tough
PoStorms BoT key - yes
HoH trials 1-3 - possibly
Mithaniel Marr - no
Terris Thule - no
Saryrn key event - yes
Saryrn - no
Caprin Cycle - yes
Bertox even - no
Tallon Zek - yes
Vallon Zek - yes
Rallos Zek - no
Grummus - perhaps

Fire access,

All of the above, plus
Agnarr - probably not
Solusek Ro mini's - yes (only required for access to Sol Ro's chamber)
Solusek Ro - probably not

I don't think I missed any.

Some of those are one-groupable with better gear, some aren't one 
groupable regardless of your gear, at the moment, IMO.
