Got to agree there. The PvP aspect of DAoC is the most attractive thing
about the game to me.
Proof will be in the playing. How easy will it be to abuse the PvP rules.
What classes will become the EQ Necro and what ones the Warrior?
Have to wait and see, I guess

Have this idea that I'll play it for a few months and either return to EQ or
play neither
But then the glass was always half empty to me...and it's dirty and it's
chipped and I've cut my lip.
