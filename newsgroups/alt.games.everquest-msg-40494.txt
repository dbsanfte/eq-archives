I would be interested to hear the details of your testing process and
the conclusions you culled from running your experiments. Significant
testing done by highly respected number crunchers from the shaman and
warrior community showed that the difference between 200 strength and
100 strength had a very marginal effect on average damage, hardly what
anyone would consider "significant". Compared to the difference
noticeable in AC you will see from sacrificing AC for the high +str
items, I don't recommend it for a class whose main purpose is tanking
and taunting, not dealing melee damage.
