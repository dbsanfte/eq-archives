Hmm, not sure about Erudin, but I know you can get them in Felwithe at the
Enchanters guild and also in FP at the Arcane Arts place. Not sure which one
of the guys there sells them, but one of them does. Sorry I couldn't help
with Erudin. I'm sure someone else here can though. And I never cast
illusion anything, since I never go to an evil place, so I can't help you
with that one either. (gee, you're saying to yourself, why did she bother to
freaking *post* then! ;) )
