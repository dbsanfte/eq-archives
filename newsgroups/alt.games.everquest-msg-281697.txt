I made my first Experts symbol last night, on my first try :) -
Expert's Boot Symbol of Terror.

Then I failed nine more consecutive attempts at a leggings symbol.

Now to make an Expert's Trooper Boots to put it in. Might take a while.
Wife is really gung-ho about going to Rathe to kill the giants for
lambent stones, but is reluctant to go on to Velious for the vellium
weapons.
