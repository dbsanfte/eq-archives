I think the only thing that threw me was the if loading char on a PC
you  dont normally play it on it creats you some hot keys and it had
put Melee in the 1st button which I have used to get SH up and is
mapped to left and right.. That and of course it remapping my attack
key to Q not leaving it on A where I was used to it.

No, I didnt die, but, I was rather puzzled that it wasnt done on me as
a lvl 1, it was done to me as lvl 65..
