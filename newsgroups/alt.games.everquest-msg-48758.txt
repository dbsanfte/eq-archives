Greater Faydark does get its share of auctions, but mainly because
so many newbies (real newbies or twinked) start there it's a good place
to dump some mid level gear, and things like bone chips/bat wings/
Crushbone Belts/pads.  It's not a really safe auction zone for evils,
though.

EC is.  As long as no fool trains Slate to the tunnel, EVERYBODY
is welcome there.  That's why it's turned into the bazaar on most
servers.  Easy access for all race/classes, and one zone from a major
teleport spot (wizard and druid teleports).
