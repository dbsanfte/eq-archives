My very subtle point was:  don't ask here, how the hell should we know?

- I know from experience that if I can access my websites then there's
nothing wrong with my ISP.  If I AM having trouble with some sites it means
there's probably an internet problem.  If I'm only having problems with
EVERQUEST support sites (such as everlore or allakhazam) it means that EQ is
down and thousands of people are bored.
- I know that my firewall settings have not changed.

From EQ's site:
Error 1001:

This error states:

"Could not connect to the EverQuest Server! Please try again shortly."

This error will only occur when you are unable to connect to the login
server. You may receive this error when the EverQuest servers are brought
down for their routine maintenance, and you try to log into EverQuest while
they are down. Please remember that any type of firewall may prevent you
from logging into EverQuest if you are blocking certain ports. Please visit
our Firewall and Proxy Information page for more information regarding the
port number for the login server. If you are having continual troubles, and
are repeatedly receiving this error even when the EverQuest server are up
then you may want to visit our Network/Connection support page for
additional connection troubleshooting.
