Err aren't all epics limited to level 50 because the quest npc's simply
won't answer if you're lower level?
Pretty sure that was inserted for all epics, at the very least most of them.
Any lower level simply died a lot of times :).

lvl 65 had a nice impact on the game, yes. But the enormous upgrade on
spells and the huge increase in gear and weapons (think mudflation) more
unbalanced the game really. Lvl 70 gear will probably mean even more
unbalances, let alone the spells that will come with it.
70 does stretch the imagination though. I mean lvl 70 means 95% of the world
will be lower level, not counting the new expansion. It will have a serious
impact on resists probably, both players for ae's / procs as for players
nuking mobs (good thing for the non-lure dps classes though ;) ).
Rebalancing the world will not be an issue, because SOE doesn't care as we
all have seen with PoP.

And besides, at 65 we already killed every god of Norrath (heck even
Kerafyrm went down). What more power can you have?
