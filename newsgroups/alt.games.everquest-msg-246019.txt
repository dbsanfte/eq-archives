I've also been having trouble with lockups in PoK.  I've been
successful with two ways around being stuck in the zone.  The first,
and easiest way, is upon zoning in, I press F9 to get an overhead
camera view.  For some reason I do not freeze unless I am in standard
view.  The second workaround is to use EQPlayNice, which tames EQ's
CPU usage.  There have been a few messages on various sites from
people that swear by EQPlayNice, but the official stance on the SOE
site is that they don't recommend it.
