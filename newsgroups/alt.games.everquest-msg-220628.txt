So you're that bastard whose cat keeps knocking over my trashcan.  :P

I choose Option D: Don't bother getting a cat until you know how to avoid
options A, B and C.  Did you miss my corresponding opinion that a large

People have mentioned the brutality of pups/kittens rejected by mothers in
this thread as though it has some bearing.  That obviously is a sign of, at

well aware of my spot on the food chain, but I'm not above tossing out some
exaggerated other-side-of-the-coin equivalency statements.
