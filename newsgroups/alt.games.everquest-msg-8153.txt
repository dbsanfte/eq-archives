How does this relate to Taras' FAQ, which is regarding the game and frequent
questions about it, not the newsgroup itself? A movement from 1999 to direct
all postings to RGCE should somehow matter in 2001, when *clearly* AGE is
the dominant, most informative and most widely used Everquest newsgroup?

Hmmm, let's see ... AGE, 1,148 posts on my newsreader right now. RGCE, 108.
Which should I read?

Indeed, listen to this:

> In alt.games.everquest's case there already is
rec.games.computers.everquest

You do know which came first, right?

Tell me how Taras has repeated what has already been done? Why on Earth
would *anyone* want to read the FAQ you so kindly posted a link to in place
of Taras'? Taras' FAQ repeats that FAQ's work how?

Taras, maybe if you changed your FAQ's name to EverQuest FAQ he'd be a bit
happier.

Feel free. Just seems a rather odd thing to be concerned about, is all ...
