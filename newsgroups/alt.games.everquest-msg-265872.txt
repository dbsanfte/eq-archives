Thing is, as I say every time people bring up the number of Lineage
and L2 subscriptions, Asian MMOGs have a lot going for them that
American games don't. And subscription numbers don't reflect the
number of accounts that are actually seeing use. Here's the deal:

-Asian internet cafes sell memberships to use their computers and all
the software on them. This includes subscriptions to every MMOG they
have installed, whether the customer actually plays them or not.
Costly? Yes, but it's unlimited play on their systems. You'll notice
that nearly all Asian MMOGs have huge numbers.

-Asians tend to be more heavily inclined toward internet gaming than
Americans, and it's not as focused into as young a crowd as American
gamers tend to be (Most American gamers, last I heard, were mid to
late 20's). While in most of the US, Internet gaming is still commonly
viewed as a "geek" hobby, you'd be hard pressed to find many people
who don't do it in, say, Japan.

-Asians have a HUGE, almost fanatical loyalty to "domestic" titles.
They'll pick an Asian-made MMOG before an US made one simply because
it's made in Asia.

Then we consider target audiences. For some god-unknown reason, Asian
gamers seem to like level grinds. Lineage 2 had a level grind that was
bad enough to have even *ME* pulling out my hair, and I'm usually the
last one to complain about a game having a level grind...
