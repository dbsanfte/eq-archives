Only level 19 myself, but almost exclusively grouped since 10 or thereabouts.

EQ2 has done a better job (or far worse, depending on how much you liked the
roles in EQ1) of not making any class give a massive advantage to a group.
Not perfect, as healer+tank is the main fight mechanic, so mages and rogues
are secondary in starting a group but more stackable when rounding out
a group.

There are a lot of situations where mezzing is great.  A melee-heavy group
against mobs that are pairs or trios of tough targets benefits a huge amount
from crowd control.  A caster-heavy group (or tank/healing-heavy with a druid
for damage shields) against swarms of easier targets is going to prefer AE
tactics.  To some extent, think of CC as backup healing - sometimes you can
prevent quite a bit of damage from being taken.  

Fortunately (or un-), enchanters are still mages at heart in EQ2, so your
DPS is not horrible for encounters where CC isn't necessary.
