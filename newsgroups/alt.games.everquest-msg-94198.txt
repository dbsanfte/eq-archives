*** Patch Information ***


- Fixed a problem with Alternate Advancement ability Combat
Fury that was causing rangers using archery and rogues using
throwing to have a lesser chance to critical than normal.  This
did not affect warriors

- We think we've fixed many of the issues that were causing
1018 errors.  At the very worst players should be able to log
back in faster now

- Fixed a problem that was causing quests to give no Alternate
Experience to a character when that character had all experience
going into their Alternate Experience pool

- Fixed a bug that was causing Claw of the Savage Spirit,
Earthen Band and Breastplate of Day to show a negative statistic
modifier

- Fixed an issue with some ATI-based video cards that was
causing the inventory screen to flash

- All Levitation spells will now be stripped when entering a
no-levitation zone.  There was a bug that caused the game to
only strip the first Levitation spell found

- Earrings of Endless Speed are now no-drop

- Fixed a bug that was displaying erroneous and duplicate faction
messages

- Also added some Tradeskill recipes for items dropping in
Akheva and Maidens eye

- Tradeskills (including Alchemy and poison) now take %skill
modifying items and buffs into consideration

- Scallywag's Arm Plates (Legends Only) are now wearable in
the arms slot (was errantly flagged for the chest slot)

- All soft wicker pieces are now wearable by Beastlords


** A Tale **

Prime Heirophant Vek leaned over and looked into the jeweled
case silently.  The young mystic behind him nervously
fingered the cudgel hanging from his belt.  He knew what
was coming.  The hold of the faceless had firmly taken hold
of his heart and was beginning to squeeze.

Vek turned to him quietly and simply said, "Find them."  He
then walked silently out of the room.

Hierophant Zand turned to the young Mystic, "Do as he has
asked.  Do not return until you have the skulls of the ancients
in your possession."  The young Mystic stumbled as he ran out
of the room, visibly shaking.

Zand looked down into the empty skull case.  Something glittered
softly in the corner of the case.  Zand reached in and picked
up a small earring, emblazoned with the symbol of the Kunzar.

Zand walked quietly out of the room, and somewhere the soul
of a dead emperor laughed with unholy malice.


** Another Tale **

Halor slashed frantically at the creature before him.  He swung
down hard, cleaving the great worm in two.  Unfortunately there
were many more were that came from.  Bauric climbed over a
rock and stood next to Halor, fighting off another of the worms.

Halor suddenly felt a sharp pain in his right heel and spun violently
around, causing his journals to fly out of his pack and onto the
hard stone floor.  He swung at the worm larva with his sword
knocking it away, but too late.  The worm had wounded him badly,
he could no longer hold himself up on the wounded ankle and he
fell to the floor with a crash.  Bauric cried out in pain as one of the
larger worms bit into his arm.  That was the last thing Halor saw
before the horde of worms squirmed across the stones and
overcame them.
