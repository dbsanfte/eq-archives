Run 1.  And then Run 2, and Run 3.

I know, you are thinking "but I'm a bard, what do I care about
pathetic slow run?"  Well I'll tell you.

1)  Selos only lasts a couple minutes.  This means you have to
keep it memmed all the time or risk having it drop out at a bad
moment if a fight goes longer than you thought it would.  Run
(and especially Run 3) is plenty fast enough to do almost any
bard job, though, so you can ditch selos, opening up a spell
slot.  If there was an AA for a 9th song slot you'd take it in a
heartbeat wouldn't you?  Well for outdoor bards, this is it right
there.

2) Go indoors and you can't selos anymore.  Two minute selos will
get you across most zones, its true, but if you are staying you
need a  lot more than two minutes.  Got JBoots/TBoots (I'm
guessing you dont' if you couldn't see why Run would be
important) thats better, but still, they run out too, just takes
a bit longer.  Even SOW runs out.  Run 3 means being faster than
almost every mob, no matter how long you've been indoors.

3) Selos (and SOW and J/Tboots) can be dispelled.  Run 3 can't,
so dispeller mobs won't be able to drop your movement speed down
to where they can catch you and keep you stunned so you can't get
moving again.

4) I keep saying Run 3, but Run 1 is the most important one for
most classes, its the "faster than mobs" speed.  Run 2 and 3 are
merely better... but for bards who spend a lot of time running in
circles, well, 2 and 3 are a lot safer, you might not want to
discard selos or the boots with only run 1 while chant or swarm
kiting.  For other classes, well Run 3 is fast enough that most
of the time I don't lose my party if they run off sowed and I'm
not, other than that, the only reason I went past Run 1 is that
there's nothing better to do with the first tier of AAs for a
cleric.

==========================================

After that, its hard to say, the first tier AAs are a pretty
useless lot, but you need three more eventually to get to the
higher level AAs.

One unusual place to put it would be First Aid; since you can
sing HP song and bind wounds at the same time, bandaging can
actually be pretty effective for bards.  Since this means
something to do in down time, I personally gave it up about 30
levels ago, frankly I need the rest more than I need the downtime
reduction.

Regen, on the other hand, is a joke IMO, with lute and the 55
heal/mana song on I'm getting 25 hp per tic back, its not often
that one or two more are going to matter to me.  Of course this
works all the time, not just when singing that song... but I've
very rarely been in a circumstance where a tiny bit more regen
would matter to me; if I need some regen (even while fighting) I
just start including the song in my twist.  Primary slot string
instrument helps a lot here, if you can get one...

I'd avoid the stat and resist ups myself, each is going to be a
very very small upgrade to your character in exchange for a
massive chunk of exp (one AA is like leveling up from 51 to 52
again... not a big deal at 60, but pretty onorous at 52!  If you
want better magic resist, go invest in some MR gear; it doesn't
have to be better than what you are wearing, when you need the MR
you take off your normal item and put the MR item on instead,
taking a small performance hit for the protection.  95% of your
life you won't care about the MR anyway.  If I were a betting man
I'd wager you have 7 slots where you could put a MR upgrade item
on for under 50pp each... thats a far cry from what it takes to
get an AA.

Lets see, what else.  "Improved Natural Lung Capacity"  Holding
your breath longer.  Yeah, thats a winner.  If it was EB I'd say
get it, but its not.  So keep your SS Gaunts handy or get one of
the many other EB items out there and forget this one.   For CRs
in unbreathable places, no biggie, we have a song for that.

A surprisingly nice one is the one that slows your eating rate
down.   "Improved Natural Metabolism" There are some very nice
stat/resist increasing food items out there, trouble is
eventually even if you deliberately force eat other foods to
preserve them, eventually you are going to go AFK longer than
expected somewhere without hiding the good food, and eat them.
Eating and drinking less often would help stretch this out.  If
you don't eat stat foods, it won't be all that big a help, just
save you 10, 25 and 50% on the pittance you put into food and
drink, if forage isn't working in the zone you are hunting in. As
a Vah Shir my metabolism is twice as fast as anyone elses, so I
get the reverse effect there, bad thing about Cat Bards is they
find it harder to use stat foods.  Ah well, we look good, and
thats whats important.
