I bet there's nothing for us warriors as per usual except some weps which will
be very similar to existing weps with 1 or 2 points different. I picked a
warrior because i liked the idea of just plain fighting. Could desperately do
with some new abilities though. Are we the most neglected class around or is
there a worse one? Not sure as i only play a couple characters. Seen anything
on test to do with LDoN that could be good for us warriors?
