Excellent criteria. I too play that way and wish everyone would.  It would make
the game so much better. I especially agree that even if you dont normal
roleplay, when asking a stranger for buffs/sow why not use a roleplaying way of
asking.  I have had the experience of being on people's buff as you see them
list just because i have been polite to them in the past i am sure. 
   If you ask me the right way i will most certainly give you all the sow/buffs
i have even if it takes away the remainder of my mana. :)
