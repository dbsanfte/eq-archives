I got lucky TWICE! I was whacking rats in Qeynos newbie garden when 
somebody showed up shouting "Anyone wants a Hero's Bracer?? I'm dropping 
at gate" I didn't even know what it was, but I rushed into the gate to 
pick it up with my necro (invis ofcourse) and I found it a "very" nice 
item for my warrior.
Few days later I was there again shopping with my Necro this time, and 
somebody auctions off a Hero's Bracer, if anyone wants one. So I asked 
him for the price, and he said its free. So since no one else gave call, 
he handed it over to me, and now Rosse (my Warrior Troll) is enjoying it 
immensly.

That's exactly how I ended up with a black enameled chest plate and a set 
of crafted armour, but I was just wondering if there are any upgrade sets 
available in the near future. Not that this crafted armour is bad, far 
from that, but I like to have some alternatives available to me :-)
