    Same here.

    Sometimes they don't come back quickly if you train them away. But I've
also seen them warp back to spawn after the trainer feigned or died.

    If anything it was worse than a lot of the elemental AE stuff since
until recently you could dodge them and still CH.

    There's a way other than Levitate? Is it a tunnel through the lava or
something?

    With the recent changes a lot of AEs just can't be resisted. I'm over
200 unbuffed in all but one resist, and there's not many AEs I can think of
where I'm expected to stand in range and resist. Gator in PoE, some of the
Water stuff, maybe Babs and Pyronis in Fire, that's about it. If you need
better "plus all" resist gear, start adding Seru to the raid list. Lots of
good all/all plus all resists items, you don't really need Serubane to kill
him, the key to get in isn't terribly hard to get, the HP/MANA on the drops
makes them worth getting even at your level of play, and the raid takes like
an hour tops.
