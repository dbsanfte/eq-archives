The difference being I was planning on staying for the long haul and play
anyways even if it's not exceptional.  I was planning on playing the 3 other
classes I created up to higher levels in addition to the caster I made.  I
think now I will just play my caster as far as it is still entertaining.  If
I make it to the max level, and I'll probably quit then.  Play CoH and WoW
for a bit and finally return to EQ1.  Even if I'm not playing any other
games, I'm sure I'll be there at EQ1 when they turn off the lights.....
