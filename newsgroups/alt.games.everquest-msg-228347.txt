"paying a bit less and and getting nearly the same level of 
performance." sounds about right. What did you expect?

You lose a little quality, and it won't be as flexible to upgrade, but 2 
same clocked P4s with the same graphics chipset and quanity of RAM 
aren't going to be that wildly different in performance unless you 
deliberately gimp one of them with 5400rpm drive or something...

There are good motherboards though and there are bad motherboards; 
they'll perform abut the same in terms of gaming experience, but 
features and upgradability between them can vary wildy. Go with a dell 
and you'll almost invariably end up with a motherboard on the bad side 
of the midpoint.

I agree with pre-built for the unititiated, but that doesn't mean you 
have to go with a 'big brand'. The local system builders will put 
together better machines for the same price.
