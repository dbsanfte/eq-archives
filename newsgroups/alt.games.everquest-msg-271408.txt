I'm not sure what you're aiming at. There isn't a problem to ask higher
level players about their experiences and/or hints.

The military example isn't the best one I think. After all elite units
will die as easily as novice soldiers when hit. In an MMOG higher levels
nearly can't die when facing a low level foe. As an example just imagine
your group of youngsters attacking an Orc camp. They will be hard
pressed to survive and have to learn how to work efficiently as a group.
Add one lvl70 to that group as mentor and it's pointless. He could stay
in the camp and go afk. Even if the orcs would attack him they didn't
stand a chance to kill him! The only way to counter that would be a game
mechanic where all mobs are adjusted to match the attacker. So when orc
chieftain tries to hit our lvl70 leader it will quad 1k+ and when
turning to bash the tiny lvl10 wizard in the back he attacks with 15+
hits. I prefer the current system though!

Therefore the training should be outside of actual combat and through
talking about it. There is alot of knowledge a high level player can
share with newbies. But using the higher level player as an anvil for
smiting foes does not work.

The other point you did mention were tradeskills. Again talking to more
experienced crafters can give you more insight on how to advance faster.
That this talking is substituted by checking on websites outside the
game does not make this point invalid. You benefit from crafters that
found it out before you.

Why do I think you describe exactly how EQ works? After all you can have
quite a large level difference in groups. A lvl70 could group with a
lvl47. And if they do attack foes appropriate for the lvl47 advancement
for the lvl70 would be painstakingly slow. And it would be pointless the
other way around as the lvl47 can't contribute to the lvl70.

Last I'm really interested what you propose. After all everything I've
read so far is just that this mechanic is dumb, moronic or whatever.
