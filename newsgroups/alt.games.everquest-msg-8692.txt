go for a gnome necro then.  Not automatically KoS, does have
some faction issues but not as many as a DE, and not night
blind.  I know that you mentioned it under monk, if it
wasn't a concern I would have said Erudite.  Especially with
the opening of the warrens, this race/class has really
started coming up in the world, and after a while night
blind isn't as much of an issue. At level 8 necro's get dead
eye, and shadow sight at 24. plus carrying a gls around
isn't that big of a deal.  While not being night blind is
conveinent, there are plenty of ways around it. The fear
kiting possibilities are great and most of your dot's should
stack.  Necro/druid is a good duo combonation from what i
have seen/experienced.
