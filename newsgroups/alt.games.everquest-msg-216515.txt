What on earth would be new and novel about importing 65th level 
characters from EQ1? Take the character you've spent 1000s of hours on 
and... play him some more.

For EQ2 to be even remotely new and novel its gotta be a clean break 
from EQ1.

Letting you import chars from EQ defeats the clean break, and lets you 
skip most of the content (especially since the initial content will be 
geared to the low-mid game)... unless EQ2 starts at 65th level... that 
would work too, but that doesn't make much sense.  After killing the 
God's of Norrath on the outer planes... what exactly do you plan on 
doing in EQ2 with imported characters??
