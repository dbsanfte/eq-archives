Well, I didn't think the NG's had "rules". This is the wide world of the
internet, after all. Other languages don't annoy me, but not understanding
motivation does. Lot of difference, there, between those 2 (two) I have very
few pretenses, and none of them are naivete. (are you a psychologist, btw?
suppression? where did that come from? Oh nevermind, you wouldn't know the
answer to that one either) I'm not *trying* to be the goddamned language
police, I was asking a **question**, which no one has seemed to be able to
answer, not even you, pal. So just shut the hell up unless you actually CAN
answer my question.
