You know, I rarely agree with bizbee, it seems, but it would never occur to
me to write something like that.  I take it you've never known anyone who
had cancer.  I do, and it was tough to watch her struggle with her Leukemia
(she's in remission now, thank Kami).  That you would write something like
that tells me you're a reprehensable person, of no value to society as a
whole.  I won't hope you die, all I can do is take pitty on you.  I'm sure
I'll be next on your death list for this.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.

--Megumi Hayashibara, Sakura Saku
