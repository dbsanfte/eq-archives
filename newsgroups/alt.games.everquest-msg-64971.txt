*sigh*

My last computer was one I built. I wanted to upgrade *everything*
(including the monitor) so I started looking at pre-built systems. For my
birthday, my bf bought me this Gateway. I was thrilled.

My computer before the one I built was a Packard Bell. THAT was why I wanted
to build my own system. I wanted to get away from the propriatery, onboard,
'card' combo (Like modem/sound card), crap.

I must have forgotten. Now I remember.

(And, btw, he is right. It is surprisingly easy to build your own system. If
*I* can do it, I'm sure many of you can too. :))
