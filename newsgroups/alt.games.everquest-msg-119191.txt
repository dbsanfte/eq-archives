   Kill the Sisters in the Ocean of Tears.  They are on the first island the boat
stops at out of Freeport.  If you cannot wait on the dock, then watch for the boat
and swim to meet it, and let it scoop you up.  At 12 they will be blue- yellow to
you.  They will agro on a necro and they are are social.  Bind yourself in the
Freeport dock area because you will probably die at least a couple of times.  Oh, and
jump off the boat and swim to shore before the boat actually docks.  As you fact the
docks from the ocean, run along the shore to the right.  There is a small outcropping
of land that is more or less a safe spot.  I've spent ALOT of time hunting sisters
with my various characters, and have only been aggroed there 4 or 5 times.
   So why go to all this trouble?  Purity belts, my friend.  Almost all the sisters
carry them, and they sell for a plat plus a few gold each to merchants.  Or you can
try to sell them to players, they have some nice stats for lowbies.  The sister
merchant won't buy and sell to you, of course, but there in another, shorty (dwarf,
maybe, I forget) merchant that might on the other side of the island (this isn't a
very big place).  Even if you have to gate back to Freeport to sell, it is worth it. 
My necro on Drinal made enough money to buy a full set of Flayed from these girls (I
do tend to drive a hard bargin and low-ball sellers though. YMMV).  Plus, you'll have
the satisfaction of finally bottoming out your pesty wood-elf faction!
