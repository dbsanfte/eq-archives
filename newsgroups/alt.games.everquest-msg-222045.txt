Gratz on 27. My first instinct was to play a little devil's advocate here 
and suggest that maybe they *were* merely a new player power-leveled to 
an inadvisable level. That perhaps they would be interested in a few tips 
from someone in the know. That maybe they had an honest interest in 
improving their game. That your taunt skill, even maxxed at your level, 
isn't very reliable and likely contributed to the problem to some degree 
- not your fault, just the way it is.

Then I read his quote. Screw him. Leave him to waste many more hours of 
his life in futility trying to level up when he has steadily alienated 
those around him. Let someone else raise the little bastard.

I would just feel kinda bad for the others in the group, although if he 
was that big an ass about it, they probably didn't tolerate him for much 
longer anyway, and besides, it's not like there is a shortage of people 
ready to take your places in the group from that zone. I can't stand HHK.

I'm ready to try yoga or something to help me tolerate these kinds of 
people.
