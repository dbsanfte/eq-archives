You can make Mage friends easy by helping them with their epic. I
think it's mages that need to kill Captain Rottgrime (one of the
skellie soldiers in OT Outpost). If you really want to take out your
frustration on the outpost, that's probably the most constructive way.

From watching a failed attempt recently, I can suggest the following
for such a raid:

1. You need someone who is insanely good at single-pulling to pull him
out of the outpost.
2. You need to do it at night when the goons have all left the outpost
and are harassing people over at the SF and FM zones.

Good luck!
