More like 10 seconds (not quite 2 ticks, never bothered to time it
exactly).  And you can't bind for more than 50 per bandage until
you are 51+.


> Troll / Iksar regen, when sitting, is about 4 hp every 6 seconds.


It is exactly 4/tick for L1 thru L19, 6/tick L20 thru L49.  But your
point, that bandaging outstrips regen even for the races with doubled
regen rate, is true.  For a Shaman of L19+ however the spell Healing
allows you to regain health faster than bandaging because the mana
you med stting converts nicely to HP, and the sit regen while med'ing
adds to that.  The only advantage bandaging has then is that it does
not break hide/invis and that's not very relevent to Shaman as they
don't get invis until L29.  Ranger is the only "healing" class I know
of for whom bind wounds is really useful, because their heals are so
crappy and when soloing the doesn't break hide/invis factor can be
useful (maybe works for BL too, I am not familiar with their skills
and spells).
