Uh, yes. But the *client* draws the moon and stuff, and if
the server tells the client that north is south and all that,
the moon, the sun, swords, and the clouds would all behave
as expected from the sense heading. You lie to the client,
therefore you don't need to actually fix the zone. An
example:

Your actual (Server-side, the server is always right) loc
is -1000, +500, +20. The server computes fake x and y coords
like so:
fakex = -x
fakey = -y
and sends the fake values to the clients, for OOT only.

The player types /loc, gets told that his loc is +1000, -500,
+20.

Then the player moves to his northeast a bit. His /loc
command would now show +1500, -1000, and the client would
send back this new loc to the server, which would then
reverse the process to get the actual loc of the client.

Now, since drawing of objects is done client-side, the
player would see the sun rising in the east and setting
in the west, and the moon rising in the north and setting
in the south (Or however the Norrath moon rises and sets,
it's been a while since I played). Players would also see
the swords pointing due north, and the clouds would be
scudding across the skies in the normal direction (from
east to west, or vice versa, I forget).

All this due to the magic of lies and deceit!

I'm sure there's a logical flaw in my fix, but I'm equally
sure this isn't it. Hey, I dreamed it up in two minutes,
there's *gotta* be a fatal mistake in there!

Anyway, the point is moot, as trying to incorporate such
a kluge at this point in the game's life would be a Bad
Idea...
