Thank you for your uninformed opinon.  A few corrections follow.

"Homosexual" is a misnomer at least as much as "homophobe".  If you
want to get picky about numenclature and etymology then you should be
consistent.  Better yet, don't nit-pick, a great many words are no
longer used according  to their original definitions.

The Ontario Government has indicated that it will not appeal the
decision.  The federal gov't has not, IIRC, officially responded yet.
It would be SOP for them to wait until the deadline for provincial
appeal has passed before taking a stand.  Given the current political
climate, though, all bets are off when it comes to predictions.

If the Supreme Court so declares, it will indeed apply to all
provinces and territories.  I am well aware of Alberta's threat to use
the notwithstanding clause (friendly correction: I know it looks ugly,
but it's spelled as one word).  Several legal authorities believe this
to be an incorrect and invalid use of that clause.   That  debate
would be lengthy and nasty.  I doubt Alberta would get much sympathy
from the other provinces or other countries for fighting what is
considered a condemned form of discrimination by the UN, Amnesty
International, the Europena Union.... you get the idea.  On a bright
note the notwithstanding clause would finally be tested, I don't think
it ever has been, and it is best to be clear on these things.

They have little ground not to.  Do you really want the Supreme Court
to say that its OK for the Canadian government to ignore the
Constitution and the Charter of Human Rights?  Think about that for a
minute.

Ah yes, I'm sure you have the wisdom, knowledge, and experience to
back that up.  Tell me, did you actually READ IT?

Enlightening you should be no problem, if you open your eyes.  For
example two "single men" together collect more welfare and EI than a
couple.  Both collect GST refunds.  A couple should only qualify for a
CHMC mortgage once- but two "single" men get around this, and this a
gay couple could get a government-guaranteed mortgage twice.   Prior
to Jan. 1, 2001, had I defaulted on my student loans and had no
assets, the goverment could not have gone after my spouse's assets.
Get the picture?

Actually, it would not advance my agenda personally at all, quite the
opposite, but that's another discussion.  I also see no reason that
every last law should benefit every Canadian.  You failed to comment
on the sig line, I notice!

Stop bullshitting your way through rationalizations and just get to
the point.  *You* don't want same-sex couples to be allowed to marry.
Have the balls to voice your opinion, man!

couples the freedom to marry...
