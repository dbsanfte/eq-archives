You pullled the pin on a hand grenade and tossed it at
your attacker, managed to hit a cop as well as the
mugger.

FInd me a court in the land that isn't going to crucify you.

AOE spells are generally a very poor way to damage
a single mob anyway, usually you do a good deal
less damage per point of mana than any DD spell
you might have.  The mana efficiency comes from
doing that amount of damage multiplied by the
number of mobs you hit.

Unfortunately, due to the lack of buffering by
walls, and worse the fact that your spell doesn't
affect a globe shaped area but rather an infinite depth
and height cylinder, you will find youself annoying
a large number of creatures you can't even see,
unless you are very careful and know exactly
what you are doing and where you are doing it.

I reccomend using a pistol (DD) for self defence
instead of a hand grenade (AOE)
