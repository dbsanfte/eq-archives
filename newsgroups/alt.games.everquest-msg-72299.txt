I was raiding with a group in Sirens grotto tonight and I won the roll on a
pair of Netted Kelp Pantaloons , woo hoo.
That was a good place to hunt many of the mobs were dropping quest gems and
I saw about 3 pair of int caster boots get rolled on.

Netted Kelp Pantaloons -
Races: ALL - Classes: ALL (LORE - MAGIC)
Stats: AC: 6 - Wt: 0.7 - Slot: legs
Attributes: STR+6 STA+8 CHA-8 INT+6 SV FIRE+10
Comment: Found in Siren's Grotto.
Average Price: 6,900

Works great for me as I finally got my stamina over 100 with these. Only
drawback with the netted kelp stuff is they all have neg charisma, must be
that smell of seaweed that turns people off, hehe.
