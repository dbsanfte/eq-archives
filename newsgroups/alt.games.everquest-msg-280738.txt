Not that that is necesarilly any more credible than any other source, 
but, the figure mentioned in there was prior to the merger of the 
servers, basically pointing out what EQ had at it's peak, and making a 
remark saying what the servers could support.  Did SoE tell them that the 
figure is correct?  I honestly see no reason to believe their figures any 
more than those of anyone else.
