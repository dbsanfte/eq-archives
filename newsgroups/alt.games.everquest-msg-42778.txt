If you can tp, why not stay bound (or as some would say binded) in loio, gate
there to bank, and sow/camo back to loio? There is *always* at least one sow
and/or invis-capable person at the bank in FV, in fact I've made it a point to
occasionally sit there and do nothing but while waiting for guildmembers to get
their less-mobile hides over from butcherblock.
