I don't need to see what your rogue almost "tweeked to the gills" can
achieve, I have my own basis for comparison.  To you 20k is "almost tweeked
to the gills" - shrug - my rogue started at level 1 with 250k PP or so of
gear with a 65 shaman by his side.

I don't think the fact my clearly much better geared (and buffed) rogue
can't tank at PoP levels is down to his not being a barbarian (laugh), I'd
put it more down to the fact mobs hit HARD - then again so does my rogue,
but only when hes BEHIND the mob.

Didn't we already hear this story... several times?

I bow to your leet 2 boxing skills, or something..

/boggle.. where is that relevant?   She is a paladin. A TANKING class.  You
were talking about an average geared rogue tanking.

LOL, come get me, big guy.

Do you use a similar excuse after you just clattered your wife and kids, as
if its some kind of excuse or justification?

I really don't think there is anything you can teach me about the rogue
class, least of all when you don't even have a weapon to even ATTEMPT to
backstab.  I think I'll save my rogue questions for jekke, if thats ok with
you?

And consider if he BACKSTABBED (you know, a rogues class-defining skill),
his max hit would be several hundred.   My rogue has very little in the way
of gear and AA's (for a level 65), and his max hit is 1300 or so.

This gets better!  You wanted a tank, but chose a rogue over a warrior, for
5 extra training points?  Lol..  umm...

Could it be that your R/L friend is even more retarded than you?  I mean,
does he use 2 shields or something?

Ohh thats what a whine con mob is!  GD, how would I have ever survived in EQ

No, the stamina drain is because you don't know about the shaman class.
Spell: Acumen

You work in law enforcement, but want to hit me through the computer?
My sides are starting to hurt now.

Because I have a 65 shaman already (iksar)
Because a barbarian shaman doesn't even come close to being a tank
Because warriors bore me.

What exactly does a shaman need with INT?
Btw to figure ot how much more HP you would have,had you put more points
into STA, take that 300 figure you pulled out your ass, and divide it... by
a factor of, say, 10..

Thanks for the fun this morning :)
