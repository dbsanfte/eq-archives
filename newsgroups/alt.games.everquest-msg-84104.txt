It's a quest in Sth Qeynos, Menkes Tabolet needs a rats foot and 2 rat
whiskers and he'll givemake you a rat foot necklace +2hp -1 cha nothing
special but a small sense of achievement for completing a quest.

Try here if you are stuck for any quests
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/qitemlist.html  the info is sent in by
players so the list isn't complete...for example I have the head of a Dark
Elf on my bard (guy that runs around outside WFP) and not a clue who it's
for, I do remember speaking to someone about the this guy but that was long
before I actually killed him...think the head is still rotting in my bank
:ï¿½)
