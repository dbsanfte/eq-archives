thats an ok start i guess... (green really isn't my colour ingame if the
truth be known.. i much prefer black).

I hate the fact my (iksar) shamans head item turns into some fugly green
thing with horns (its normal when my cleric or monk models it)

Its ok I know your just playing hard to get...

You want me to beg you to model your gnome-skin legs for me, don't you!

hehe.. an old friend used to get their gnomeskin outfit from the bank
everytime they came and met me, afer I told them i <3 black... if only I had
wood elf luclin models on!
