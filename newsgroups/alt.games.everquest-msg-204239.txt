Well Nerf meant to make something less effective, ie a Nerf (foam covered)
Baseball bat is less effective than a Wood or Aluminium one. So KEI was
actually be a Nerf as it became less effective (still works the same but no
longer can be cast on all levels) although in reality the KEI situation was
just a Bug fix on the Group Buff exploit, it was only when these buffs began
to unbalance the lower game that they decided it needed fixing.
When removing something or making something easier I don't really think you
can apply and nerf or Unnerf tag to it.
Something would have to have been nerfed first to be unnerfed...Bloodpoints,
for example. Language skill on FV was never Nerfed, it was always that way
then the rule was dropped.
I'm not sure what you call something when the game is changed to make it
easier for the players...a Furor Tantrum maybe?
