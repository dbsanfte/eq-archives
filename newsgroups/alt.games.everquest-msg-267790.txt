/nod.

My own view is that this is a low traffic group already.  For whatever reason,
a lot of EQ'ers do not post here, but instead inhabit the various web forums.

In my opinion, a discussion group does need a certain minimum level of
participation to have any interesting conversations in it.  We have that now,
but not by any huge margin.  Splitting the group and causing 50-75% of the
posters to leave could well result in two groups which are muddling along with
*extremely* low message counts, which both eventually die out and move to web
forums... which we all agreed a few messages ago that we hate.

Including EQ2 and EQ posters in the same group gets us to that level of
critical mass.  The games are not identical, but they are close enough that
mixing them is not an idea out in left field.   They share everything that is
common to all MMORPG's, as well as several things specific to the EQ series.

Seriously, take a look at the Diablo and Diablo 2 newsgroups, which almost
certainly came into being in a manner not dissimilar to this.  They have
evolved into two separate "Diablo 2" forums., with a little Diablo 1 chatter
in the first group.   Both with lower populations than a combined group would
have.   (The difference being that they had enough usenetters to keep both
groups running.)

Even if you create an EQ2 newsgroup, I'm not at all convinced that the traffic
will really go there.  Again, see Diablo 1/2 groups.

Perhaps it will, perhaps it won't.   But what is the huge rush that we can't
see how things work out staying here and labeling messages?    It's not any
harder to create an EQ2 newsgroup a month from now than it is to create it
now.

(just opinion)
Right now it seems like it would work out ok to me...  We can have discussions
of EQ2 when there are big changes there (and yes, we're seeing more than
normal now due to release, that will go down soon.)  and discussions of EQ1
when there are big changes there, say for instance if a major patch goes
through, or a new expansion gets announced.    The only way we *might* get
overwhelmed is if both games had major patches come down the line at the exact
same time, which both generated a lot of discussion.
(/just opinion)

Any possible EQ2 FAQ is completely unrelated to the issue of whether there is
one newsgroup or two.   A FAQ is compiled by a poster or group of posters, not
granted by the newsgroup gods.   Theres no reason we couldn't work up an EQ2
FAQ here, and post it in a separate message whenever the EQ1 FAQ is posted.
