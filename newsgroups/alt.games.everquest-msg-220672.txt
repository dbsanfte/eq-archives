Why not just nerf the plat drops so that HG's drop an appropriate amount of
plat for their level & difficulty? Maybe 4-6 max.

Methinks you're there more for the cash bud... if you were after xp wouldnt
you be hitting mobs that had less hp?

For that matter, any druid that whines he/she cant get a giant is a
hypocritical sob, at 40th I KNOW youre not killing nearly as many PH's as
all those dukes & barons, more likely youre hitting track every time it
refreshes & beating them to the spawns they caused. (spoken from true
experience, 47 druid that doesnt even like to clicky dot the ph's, freakin
ES vambraces need a 4 sec casting time like the ES gaunts & warden symbol of
tunare) The druids are the ones with one giant rotting while another is
rooted with a single dot on it. IF you were there by yourself odds are your
HG kill rate would drop substantially due to the need to kill PH's. Consider
the pain of all those pet classes who SLAUGHTER PH's but dont have track to
lead them to the half dozen HG's they're responsible for spawning.
