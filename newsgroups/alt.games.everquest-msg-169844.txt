I have a newly leveled level 14 shaman and am still having some trouble
taking down blue creatures without DoTing them.  I have a bronze spear and
mostly leather armor with 300 hp and about 280 attack and armor of 300.  I
know I need better armor and weapon but I don't tweak!!
Is the role of the shaman to DoT until dead?
Where can I get banded armor or is there an armor quest I can do at this
level?
What is the best weapon for this level (bloodforge hammer quest?)
Or am I just trying to make a shaman into a warrior?
