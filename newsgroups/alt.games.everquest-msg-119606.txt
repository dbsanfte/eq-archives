As far as I can tell it doesn't seem to matter which CDs you use to install.
I didn't receive the free account key, but a friend did.  I already had EQ
plus all (seperate) expansions installed on my second computer.  I used my
friend's free key to make an account for me to use on that machine, and it
comes up as "2 expansions enabled."  The only thing the account doesn't have
enabled is Luclin.  The timing was great on this whole "free cd key"
promotion, as I was planning to buy the trilogy next week when my new router
arrives.  I decided to spend the money I saved on the trilogy by taking my
buddy out for a beer or three, so it worked out pretty well for him too,
even if he does still have one account.
