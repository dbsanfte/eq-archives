Ok, here's my scoop...

I work in the IT industry, and I got a pair of these glasses from the
manufacturer for free at Comdex about 1.5 years ago.  I have the wireless
pair, and please don't be deceived...these are not new, it's just a
marketing ploy to try to hit a new market.  They were made initialy for FPS
games, and work ok, but they take a LOT of tweaking to get working
correctly.

Let's put it this way, I hooked them up, played Delta Force 2 for about
thirty minutes, then they went back in the box and got put on the shelf with
the other worthless gadgets that try to appeal to gamers.

Don't waste your money....just my 2cp worth.
