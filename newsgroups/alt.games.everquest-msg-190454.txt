I'd still put a magician ahead of a druid.

First, buy an aego or virtue because those wimpy druid buffs suck.  :p

Next, go to town with a *45 point* damage shield.  Those early levels fly
by.  I literally dinged 7 times in a single trip from one side of Paludal to
the other.

Then learn the joys of 3 backpacks full of malachite and an instant reclaim
clicky.  No way a druid can PL a caster above 30 faster, and I seriously
doubt they can PL a melee faster.  45 point DS + /pet hold + reclaim =
faster than porcupining.

I found an interesting bit of info in my last PL adventure.  It takes 30
max-exp kills to get through level 30 with a froglok, 31 max-exp kills to
get through level 31, 32 max-exp kills to get through level 32, 33 max-exp
kills to get through level 33, 34 max-exp kills to get through level 34, and
35 max-exp kills to get through level 35.  Was very odd and not what I
expected.  :)  After 35 I got lazy and stayed someplace as it started to
turn blue just because it was so easy, so I don't know if that pattern
continues.
