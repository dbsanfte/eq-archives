Now I'm not trying to pick a fight, but the last I remember
somebody bugging and reporting an item dupe bug to
Verant, they got banned?

This may be ancient history, and I'm definately not bad-mouthing
Verant to be mean, but more than a year ago wasn't their
position on somebody who brought them a bug to ban their
account for DOING the same exploit they were REPORTING
of their own free will?

Please tell me somebody else remembers this?
