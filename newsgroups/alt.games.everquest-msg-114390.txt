I've started tailoring with my little gnecro.  I've never done a trade-skill
before, but it's kind of fun and wish I had started doing so awhile ago.
I'm only doing patchwork so far (WOOT!  Look what I made!) and though
nothing too useful so far it's a little amusing.
Question: how can you tell something is now "trivial"?  Will you get a
statement upon reaching that, or will it just no longer fail?

<You have lacked the skills required to make a patchwork condom>

TIA,
SEAN...
