When my warrior was 20 or 21 I took him to High Hold Pass and hunted
with the orc groups until they were getting thin, then moved into
Highkeep in the basement. If you don't get tired of it, that can take
you to 30 easily and 35 if you're really patient.

Zone into Highpass from the Kithicorre side (cross during the day) and
just look for a group killing orcs near there. You may have to get on a
list and wait a bit if it's busy, but it's some pretty nice, fast xp and
the chance of a rare drop when the named pop.
