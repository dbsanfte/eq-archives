Well, after this weekend thru much effort and more experimentation with
the trial of Flame we now have 8 people set to go see 7th Hammer with
4 more just needing to pass Flame.  Flame is a really really
annoying trial and getting past it seems to be almost matter of
luck and not skill.  It's one saving grace is that it is pretty easy
to deliberatly fail it without reprecussion.  We will keep plugging
away and hopefully be in the Hammer room soon with a raid that has
a fighting chance of success and killing him.
