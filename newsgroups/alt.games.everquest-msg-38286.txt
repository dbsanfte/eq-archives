Don't think he was exactly saying it was the truth. Just the general
perceived attitude on Usenet, usually held by trolls. Me, I've left
off threads before after the argument starts going around in endless
circles, especially when it becomes obvious that the opposition is so
totally pig-headed they won't even seriously consider my points as
being possible - no, not saying they should admit I'm right, just that
it is not impossible that I could have valid points. Happens a lot on
Usenet.
