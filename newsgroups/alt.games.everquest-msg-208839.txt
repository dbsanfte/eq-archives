I use a Dell laptop to play EQ with all expansions.
I have not had any problems with lag, only the usual stuff when going
to the bazaar.
It has basically what you're looking for, except the video is a
geoforce 4440 and has 512 mem.
I purchased mine online via dell, a few more bonuses are given for
e-purchase.
