Yeah camping Sev and the competition that goes with it is probably the worst
part of the warrior epic. It was the last piece I needed for mine and took
about 6 months to get (mainly cos I wasnt prepared to waste my life in EJ
looking for the bugger). Of the Sev kills Ive been on I'd say he drops the
scale about 50% of the time.
The red scale is a doddle to get though. Nagafen, Ragefire, Faydedar and
Talendor all drop it and not too rarely. There's also that scalekeeper guy
and Ixblat drops most of Naggy's loot table though I'm not certain about the
scale.

As for the rest of the bits, the Spiroc Wingblade is annoyingly rare but if
you've gone to the trouble of going to Sky you may as well stay and farm the
Lord til he drops some (we got 3 in about 12 kills one raid). Queen Velazul
drops the Ancient Blade 100% as far as I can tell. She's an easy kill if yo
uget it right and a hilariously fast raid-wipeout if you get it wrong :)
The Maestro hand used to be a pain when it actually dropped off Maestro but
the new mob is almost always up and my guild has had little trouble getting
the Hands it needs.

After all that trouble it's kind of a shame that the warrior epic looks a
little sad compared to SoV weaponry, and it's true what they say - the War
epic is good for damage output but pretty poor for taunting.
