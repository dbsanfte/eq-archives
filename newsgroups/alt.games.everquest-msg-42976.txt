Vey easy to get a bind just outside Cabilis in LOIO - anyone who can bind can
bind an Iksar (and, I hear, only an Iksar) on the grassy hill, well away from
any guards.

There are merchants in SK, the guards in NK are going to be a big barrier for
him though after dying.

Trust me, he doesn't want to be making CR's from Freeport through Kithicor.

LOIO is really the best bet, as you can level to almost 30 there (actually quite
beyond in once you get into the Sarnak "throne room"), and there is FM and the
mountain giants after that, plus the close access to Cabilis is definitely
usefull.
