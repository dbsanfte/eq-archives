This makes me think of a recent evening when I was on the boat in
Abysmal, practicing brewing, and someone /ooc'ed asking where to
find an oven.  There's one in the same room as the brewers, so I
told him where to find it.  Soon after I see him come in, and a
little while later he /ooc's again asking, with some embarrassment,
how to open it.  (I admit that finding the right place to click on
that particular oven took me a few tries also.)  Before I could
respond he followed it up with a "never mind".  Which stopped me
from my plan of running over to the oven, clicking on it to open
it, then asking him "Did you see how I did that?" :-)

When I mentioned this to a friend later, he said that since it was
my Iksar at the brew barrel, I could've added that I needed to take
out my Roast Baby before he started using the oven.
