Speaking only for myself, I'm bound in PoK almost all the time. Why? Because
it's a lot easier to gate back to there when I wish to go somewhere else.
Yep, if I were fighting in HHK, I could bind there, run back to PoK/bazaar,
then gate back to HHK, but it's just easier for me to have a single bind
point, since I rarely stay in a single zone for very long at a stretch. The
exception to this rule is the Warrens and Unrest when lower levels, where I
may stay for 10-15 levels or more. :)
