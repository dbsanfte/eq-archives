He's full of shit.   Just another "Grass is greener" comment.

The offensive skillcaps are the same.   A ranger though will have a self
buffed attack value of about 200 points higher than a warrior with
comparable gear.   The gap closes a bit if you allow ranger buffs cast on
the warrior as well, but rangers still retain a significant advantage from
thier self only buffs.  This completely negates the small chance a warrior
has of natural triple attacks.  And thats assuming the two charcters are
using equal ratio weapons, which is usually not true.   Ranger weapons tend
to have higher ratios (not in the insane monk range, but much higher than
warriors)... and even on the shared weapons, the warrior will often have to
forego high ratio weapons in favor of weapons with hate procs built in.

Theres no significant difference between the melee enhancing AA's of both
classes.   Most of the abilities are exactly the same.

And thats just comparing melee to melee.  Faned commented on the bow comment
pretty well, I thought, so I won't repeat him.
