In fact, whoever the current tradeskill guru is at SoE has said that the 
random number generator does have the expected distribution of number 
over the very long haul (several billion iterations I think is what he 
did), but, he did see more streakiness in it than he would like.  I 
believe there is a post at eqtraders that talks about what he said 
specifically.
