As with most things, the answer probably isn't any one of the various things 
being speculated about, but all of them. I'm sure the internal discussions 
cited resource savings as part of the justification, but I'm even more sure 
that the clincher to this pitch was the fact that it could also promote more 
account sales. Same with the decision against offline selling. Additional 
character slots and online bazaar mules are going to be enough reason for 
lots of folks to buy a 2nd account. Seems like a good business decision to 
me (even though as a Player I would have preferred different decisions on 
both points).
