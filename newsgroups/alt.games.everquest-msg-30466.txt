I was all ready to jump in and say that they drop in East Karana, since I
just finished a massive genocide campaign against the lions there, getting
my tailoring from 82 to 115.

But then I decided to check the loot by zone report from my logs.

Ruined lion skins only.  Although I could have sworn I saw a MQ skin, but
may have left it to rot on the corpse.  I let a lot of stuff rot.
