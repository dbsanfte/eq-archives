I have never played the game.  The idea of a futuristic MMORPG didn't appeal
to me immediately, but I figured I would give it a go if the game seemed
nice. I read VNBoard's SWG general discussion board for several months after
the release (it seemed to get a lot of posts) and occasionally stop by there
currently.   I don't know that SWG is dead, but people have been complaining
about a lack of content, bugs (my impression - imagine the EQ DX9 bugs on
steroids), and poor combat system since the game got started.  If the boards
are an indication (and I accept that they may not be), interest in the game
has flatlined or dropped, but they garnered such a large subscriber base
shortly after release that it's still probably hugely successful compared to
other MMORPG's.  The Space expansion is due out sometime this year.  I
figure it will be a buggy mess for quite awhile.  Maybe sometime in 2004
I'll give the game a try, but I have a feeling the price is going to be too
high for the basic game plus the Space expansion.  I don't want to plunk
down $50 (probably more) for a game that just gathers dust in my bookcase.
