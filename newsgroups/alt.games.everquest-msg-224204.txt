Thanks for all the suggestions - some are helpful ;-)

But "georg" I think you're a bit wide of the mark - in the UK the cost of an
Everquest key is far from cheap - I'm looking about �25 to �30 or about $45
just to buy what I thought I had bought.

The only positive thing is that "Game UK" offer a no questions asked 10 day
money back guarantee on all software purchases. Now, I wonder how they
manage to re-sell 2nd hand goods.....

Gareth.
