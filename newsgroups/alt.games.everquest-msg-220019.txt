1)  The game is nice if you enjoy sword/sorcery gaming.  There are some
serious holes in continuity, however.
2)  Can't answer this - another euro player could tell you.
3)  Depending on whether you pick a 'blue' (player vs. environment) or 'red'
(player vs. player) server, the harassment and cheating is either
intermittent (blue) or constant (red).
