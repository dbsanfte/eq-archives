USB 1.1 UHCI1
USB 1.1 UHCI1
USB 1.1 UHCI1
USB 2.0 EHCI

The Via KT400 chipset Southbridge is the VT8235, and it claims to have
three USB controllers, for a total of six USB ports. These device manager
entries look like 3 controllers in USB 1.1 mode (giving 3 x 12Mbits)
or one USB 2.0 controller spread over six ports. What little info
that is available is here:

http://www.via.com.tw/en/apollo/kt400.jsp

In terms of drivers, check your motherboard CD for a USB2 driver.
Win98se should have USB 1.0 covered, whereas a Via driver covers USB 2.0.

http://www.asus.com/support/download/item.aspx?ModelName=A7V8X

Select 100 items per page, then click the "All" button. Look for 
VIAUSB2V242L-M.zip. I think that is the latest version of the Via
driver. It might be the same as the one on the CD.

Some other motherboards use OrangeWare drivers for USB2, but I guess 
in this case, Via provides a driver. Just install the driver and see
if the Device Manager is cleaned up.

Can't help with the game software issue. Repost on Everquest alone.

HTH,
