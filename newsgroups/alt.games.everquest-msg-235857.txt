I'd imagine the method would be the same as for a melee, just that
you'd have to heal the caster more and buy a ton of +hp gear to make
up for a caster's poor hit points.  The player will need to do at
least a point of damage, not just the pet doing damage, for the PLee
to get exp.  (I play a pet class -- I know there's no exp if the pet
solos.)  Basically it seems like you would be PLing two newbies -- the
caster and his pet. 

If they are a pet class, you can get a summoned 500 HP belt, a haste
mask, and 2 summoned weapons with 100 HP for the pet from a high level
magician.  The extra 700 hp for the pet will help quite a bit.
