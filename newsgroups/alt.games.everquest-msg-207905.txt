    Quest XP is modified by ZEM. Bet you didn't know that, did you? My guess
is neither do the programmers.

    The way to prove this is simple: there is a rogue quest that involves
creating three PoP-level poisons, combining them into "A Bundle of Poisons",
and then handing them in to the rogue guildmaster in Ak'Anon. When the
Bundle is created, and when it is handed in, the rogue gets XP - about 3% of
an AA solo for each part. It's actually a great way to buy XP if you can
find the components on vendors (and you usually can).

    Well, a guild rogue was in Ak'Anon doing turn-ins and he noticed that
the XP from that had been nerfed down to about 0.5% of an AA. He did one
more Bundle combine to hand in and he noticed that the XP from that had also
been nerfed by over 50%. In fact, it had been nerfed from when he did the
same combine a few minutes ago in PoK!

    I told him to go to Befallen (ZEM 160, comparable to PoP ZEMs) and do
the same combine. Boom, 3% of an AA as per normal. The logical conclusion:
ZEM modifies quest XP. He tested a few other zones, and the
increase/decrease in observed XP seemed to vary as the ZEMs varied, further
bolstering the theory. I think this is why the PoK quests that gave XP
(Trep's quest, the planar armour turn-in quest) all gave large XP rewards
before being nerfed: the designers forgot about the ZEM when assigning the
amount of XP the quest should reward.

    So, for all those rogues that want best bang for the buck when doing the
poison quest for XP, be sure to do it in the highest ZEM zone you can find!

    James
