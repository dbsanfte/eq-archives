  Your best bet at lower levels for money is to go somewhere with low level
bears like the East Commonlands.  I'm not sure how much the economy has
changed since I left my old "mature" server, but you used to be able to get
1pp for low quality and medium quality skins, and upwards of 30 platinum for
high quality skins... selling to other players, that is.

   Sometimes more well-to-do necromancers and shadow knights will buy stacks
of bone chips off newbies for a platinum or two as well, so you may want to
always have at least one stack of bone chips on you in the event that you
notice someone buying.

  Good luck.
