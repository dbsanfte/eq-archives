I suffer from Dyslexia, and poor colour seporation.  I found a program that
reads the log file in real time and converts what it sees into sounds.  It
can be set up to actualy read everything that is going on.  I have mine set
up to read to me any tells, group, and Chatt chanell info as Priority, and
what goes to my Guild chat and standard say as no priority.  THis was if
there is a /gu chat the same time that some one sends me a tell, I hear the
tell in intirety, but loose what was said in /gu.

The program is called EQWatcher, and is not a bannable program.  As a mater
of fact I sent an E-mail to there tech suport, and got back a letter
describing why this program doesn't violate the EULA.  I was told that some
GM's and Techs use this program all the time.

The address is:

www.eqwatcher.com

If you read the documentation before you try to instal it, and get the
generic script as an add on, you will have everything that yopu neeed to get
him up and running.
