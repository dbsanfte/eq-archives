  Oh, I know this also.  Have known it for quite a while.  The
problem is, that by this time, I was starting to get
superstitious about it.  The mana bar  before, I had gone through
my entire mana bar without a single skill up.  /logic = OFF. 
Maybe there was a "nerf" of some sort, and I won't get a skill up
if I have something on the cursor!  I do know better....

   I thought about seeking out a KEI or mana buff of some sort,
of course.  But I do play on Test, and the Nexus and PoK is often
bare of people selling it.  Rather than be a pest pleading for
it, I just decided to tough it out.  After all, we are just
talking about one magic skill here.. one that is free to
practice.

   I guess I shouldn't bitch.   In the olden days, I understand,
BL had to learn Evocation for the first time at 30 with Spirit
Strike.  I think the word "Yikes" pretty much sums up my feelings
on what a bitch that would have been.
