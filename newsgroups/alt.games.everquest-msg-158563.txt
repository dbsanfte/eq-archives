He was in the library.  That place gets damn confusing if you wander
too much.  There's only one entrance, and it's not in plain view from
any area of the library.  I actually dragged a level 60 chanter out of
there today (and then dragged her on the book quest I'd just finished
;)).  Once you know the landmarks it's fine but DANG, the first time
it's like "um... help, before I start eating the books?"
