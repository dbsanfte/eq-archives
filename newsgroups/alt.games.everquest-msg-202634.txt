Okay, okay.  In all seriousness, and not to be busting your chops, you
really might consider ShadowBane.

Several folks I group with have tried it, though I haven't.  What they go on
and on about is:

Rapid level progression.
Downtime is practically non-existant.
Death doesn't hurt.
Guild city building.

It does seem to be more your cup of tea.

As for the KEI thing, it's tired.  There's argument, and there's time sink.
This has fallen into that second category.  You've dug in, out of anger or
out of testosterone ... and you'll never see anyone's opinion but your own
here.

And it doesn't matter.  If you want to look at a win/loss scenario, then
I've won .. the game has changed the way I want it to.  You have to deal
with it.

But as for me, my server's up and I'm in.  So I'm off to enjoy my KEI-less
gaming experience with my lvl 17 chanter.

Happy days!
