I got the same issue. Wood Elf RNG, I took a faction hit after killing
Lucan and few other Guards :P. Gathered around 40 DF  Belts, cast Wolf
Form on me. Still KoS. Here is what I want to try. I got a second
account. I can create a Monk and group with my RNG. The RNG will park
away from the entrance, and the Monk will do the quest. The RNG and the
MNK should share the  Faction right?
