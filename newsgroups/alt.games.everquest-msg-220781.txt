From the shadows, the mysterious Robb Nunya <robb969@hotmail.com> (if

At the top they have the same people saying get us a profit but those
guys aren't the ones making any part the game. They don't have the
same "bosses" (as in person in charge of getting the game made) at

have no idea, but its not Koster, and its not McQuaid or Smedley.
