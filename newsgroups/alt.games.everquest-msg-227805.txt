To add to that:
1. You can fail on a sense traps even when it is your type.  My bard will
try sense traps a second time after getting "unable to determine", or even a
third if when I did the /inspect the message sounded like it was a lock.
B. Sometimes after you get it open you will get a message saying it cant be
looted because a mob is aggro (or something like that).  There is no mob, it
is a bug.  Either get someone else to loot or relog and that will fix it.
