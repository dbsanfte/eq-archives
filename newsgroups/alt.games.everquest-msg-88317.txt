Uh, no.  That's NOT a better test; it is a flawed test.  All
your test would prove is that an Enchanter (who happens to
have better charisma) and another class may (or may not)
increase faction at the same rate.   It doesn't PROVE your
point because you have the extra variable of class thrown
into the mix.

The core of any successful proof is elimination of all variables
outside the target one.  Anything else merely proves something
else;  something that the tester quite possibly isn't even aware
of testing.

Just as an example, even creating identical characters in every
way and then giving one an item that has charisma has a flaw in
the possible conclusion.  It's possible to find that charisma below
a certain point (75, for instance) has a drawback but there's no
difference between characters with 75 and 255 charisma.  So
saying "higher charisma means faster faction gain" would be
*wrong*; the truth would be "charisma below a certain base value
causes slower faction gain."   And that's only if you see a difference.
It's just as possible to have a character that you're using to test
which *cannot* be dropped below the minimum charisma.  And
you wouldn't discover the "bad below" value that way.

At any rate, the ONLY way to test it is to create identical characters
(except for name, obviously) and modify *only* the charisma on one
of the characters *in game* via items or spells cast on them.  And
even then you have to realize what it is you're testing.
