However, try to cross check which studies the articles are basing their 
data upon. If they are still referencing the old report data vice new 
data, then that new article is essentially useless.

My main area of interest is post classical/middle ages/renaissance 
culinary and household references, so I have about a 20 year information 
cycle...whereas modern scientific data changes about every 2 years. If I 
want to determine which translation of a primary source to use, i look 
for the newest and cross check it to one i already have to see what is 
changed. There is a whopping big difference in Vehling's translation of 
De Re Coquinaria, Flowers/Rosenbaum translation [about 25 years after 
Vehling] and the one that I just got the galley proofs on that is coming 
out next summer. Why the differences? Simple. As with new scientific 
studies, new material is brought forth. Not really a big difference 
ideologically between a manuscript from 1450 that has been stashed in a 
private lbrary and now is available for translation and integration into 
corpus and a scientist getting a research grant to check on some new 
possible variant of old data. Happens all the time. Just the same with 
correlating data from older and newer studies.
