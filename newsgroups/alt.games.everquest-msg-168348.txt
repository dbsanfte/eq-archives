If you are held back why rotations, and your gameplay is restricted by them
(which I'd say it is, but your not a hardcore raider so it doesn't matter)
or even if you just don't find them fair, why do you agree to follow them?

Prexus had rotations and calendars too, once upon a time.  Then along came a
guild, believed them to be unfair and corrupt, and declared "FCFS" (first
come first serve.. whoever is there and ready to kill it first, kills it)..
and within a short period the whole server was changed into an FCFS
environment.
