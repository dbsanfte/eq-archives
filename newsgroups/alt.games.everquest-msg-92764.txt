You are assuming that fixing the gnome sitting animation was somehow 
drawing resources from the fixing of the Direct 8.1-related bugs. If you 
are a programmer yourself, you know that there are only so many different 
sets of hands you can have working on one piece of code, before you are 
actually making things worse, so if one of their programmers (or a TD or 
animator, or who the fuck knows who actually fixed that bug) managed to 
fix the gnomes while others were working, and failing, on fixing the more 
important DirectX bugs, that's fine with me.

Whether they have their priorities straight has no bearing on whether a 
less important bug cannot be fixed a head of a more important one, as 
long as they aren't competing for resources. Unless, of course, you are 
suggesting that *all* programmers working for Verant sit on their asses 
and play Freecell until the one or two working on their login procedures 
find the bug.
