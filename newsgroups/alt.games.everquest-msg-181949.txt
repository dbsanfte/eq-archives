No, else ppl would be doing that all day.  Your best customer will be
players.

Now farming ingrediants, making combines and selling to vendors has
potential, but takes time.

Similarly, many players will pay for the conveinece of something rather than
farm it, take a look at Leather Padding for 25p (LQ pelt + 2 spidering
silks)...purely a time savings there.
