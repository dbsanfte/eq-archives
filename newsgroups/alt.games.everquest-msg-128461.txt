My easy solution was to not install logitech's drivers.  Just let windows
install its default drivers.  Some disadvantages to this, such as suddenly
losing your mouse or keyboard while pulling ToV (nah, that's never happened
to me).  You don't get battery warnings.  You will, surprisingly, have
almost full functionality, volume, mute, scroll, cd controls, all work just
fine.  The web buttons don't, but they'll crash EQ too so that may be a good
things.  :)
