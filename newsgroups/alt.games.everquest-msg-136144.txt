Like RS I've not personally been in the military, though my father, my
brother, my father-in-law and 2 very good friends have been.

Again, you seem to possibly have a point with your snide one-liner ( I can
tell YOU have never been in the military). Again, however, you simply slide
the remark in with no explanation of why, leaving us to try to interpret why
you may want it there.

I'm going to interpret this as some belief of yours that the military goes
out of its way to create lies and double-talk to cover up its actual motives
and actions.  If this is the case, I would state that quite to the contrary,
in many venues the military is very direct.  I would also state that the
military is not the only place in which such double-talk can be found. I
would further state that the supposition that any statement made by any
organization is filled with such double-talk, regardless of the source of
the subject matter, may be bordering on paranoia.
