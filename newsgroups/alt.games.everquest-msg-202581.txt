<<<I understand exactly what you are saying, you are the one who is failing 
to understand here.  Sony, you know, the people who own and opearate 
Everquest, decided a long time ago that EQ is a multiplayer game where 
they want to heavily encourage players to group and play together, and 
they want to discourage not doing so.  This fix of group buffs is just a 
step they have taken to reinforce that.  I understand perfectly well that 
you don't like that, and are unhappy with it.  Tough, go play a game that 
suits your playstyle.>>>>

You're not very bright are you?  I have not argued that Sony has no right to do
this.  They can do whatever they want and the rest of us have to deal with it. 
My point is that we can have a mmorpg without having so much downtime and it
was here with KEI.  You knuckleheads seem to think it's impossible without
sitting around medding all the time.  Obviously they could have given greater
experience bonus's to groups, even greater than the ones they are giving, if
they wanted to get more people to group and it would have worked and less time
would be spent in game doing nothing.  My only point is that I don't like to do
nothing which is impossible the old way.  The old way there is a lot of time
spent doing nothing.  I can remember having discussions with people about what
book they were reading while the group was medding?  That's fun???
