    Senior Guide Lovaine went over to production side for me to
ask a GM to do that, and in her words "No one would".  When I
went to the chat room I got pretty much the same response "We are
not here to provide technical assistance, just moniter chat and
ansswer questions if we are able too."  I guess I could try
again, but this was pretty discouraging to me.

    Going on two days of being under the world and LD.  I've used
/bug, contact your GM email, and of course constant, and I do
mean constant, petitions.  If I'm still on when I get get home, I
guess I'll try round two of the same.

Annie
