Talking funny groups, did a faction repair visit to the Riff cycle in
Kael (9th ring quest fight for those servers that call that place
different)
65 rogue
65 bard
62 shaman (me)
61 bard
47 warrior bot (who made out like a charm on thurgadin plate armor)
Turns out this former guild raid event can be run like a clockwork
with 4.5 people now. Rogue tanking, bards doing CC, shaman buffing,
hasting and healing. A real fun time with an old encounter.
