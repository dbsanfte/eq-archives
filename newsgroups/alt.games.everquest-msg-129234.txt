No, it wasn't on Ragefire. :-p

But my third crit using Ice Comet last night dropped an Elder Wurm with
a shot of...

OMFG!

1933

I nearly shit.  This was with a set of focus items given to me by the 60
mage we've been grouping with.

Got me to wondering... what's the max possible crit for Ice Comet from a
49 wizzy, and what affects the limit? Hrmmm.  That's got to be damned
close to it, I would imagine. It seemed like my hits without the focus
gear resulted in "normal" blasts of 1110.  With the focus gear, the full
(non-crit) shots seemed to be in the upper 1200's.  So crits only do a
max of what? One and a half times normal, or is it twice normal?

Anyway, it was a pretty thrilling shot. Pity I didn't get a screenie,
but there was an add on us. :-(  But it was a blast! (pun intended.)
