Not to my knowledge, although, if you buy any version of it you still 
get the first 30 days free. The best value is probably the Evolutions 
box which is coming out in a few days; includes all the expansions up to 
and including Ykesha, and a free month of play.

Even if you got on a free 30-day trial, you'd still end up buying 
evolutions if you wanted to continue to play.
