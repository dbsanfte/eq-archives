Don't feel bad, I got the same landscape poofing and just the sky remaining
BS yesterday myself.. I rebooted.. no more problem.. did that make it go
away, I somehow doubt it. Does it lead me to believe that either a) textures
are corrupted or b) EQ still has more leaks than our government? yes.
I'm going to experiment with a few things today (like trying to figure out 
who
all has fried a monitor  trying to do a 200hz refresh rate as per a new 
setting in EQ)
to see if I can fix this problem without the illustrious assistance of the 
leather
and chain wearing gang at SoE. If you come up with a solution to the 
landscape
poof glitch post it plz, save me an aneurysm.
