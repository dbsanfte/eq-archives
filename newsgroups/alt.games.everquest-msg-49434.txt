I've taken a few small breaks from EQ over time and I always come back
feeling refreshed for it :)
Usually I feel much better after a single evening away - as soon as I've
caught up on the housework and my abode is fit for human habitation again.
During these breaks I usually keep up with friends who are still playing
(there are a few that I work with so it's hard to avoid), still come read
this group and a few message boards, so the bug never really goes away. And
after a week I realise that those TV shows I was missing aren't all they are
cracked up to be anyway, and I still can't be bothered to cook properly
(heh), and then I hear of my regular group doing something great that I
missed out on, and slowly but surely I get sucked back into Norrath :)
And after these breaks I seem to be able to manage my time better for a
month or two, and don't play every night so I have time to catch up on some
DVDs or books or even just to call some friends and talk bollocks for a few
hours.
In the end EQ is better than a lot of books and practically ALL television -
heck it's like one big interactive soap opera with cartoon violence thrown
in (who hasn't wanted to watch a show like that eh? :) No, WWF DOESN'T
COUNT) and you got to play your own small part in it. Pretty good
entertainment for 10 bucks a month ;)
