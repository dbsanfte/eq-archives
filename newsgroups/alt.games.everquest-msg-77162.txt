If the problem has only appeared since SoL came out, you're shit outta luck,
sorry. :-/  Your CPU is FAR below minimum...and their published minimum was
VERY generous (the recommended is damned close to realistic minimum).

Minimum states P2-266...you don't even have a P2.

I'm NOT flaming you or anything, just giving you the bad news.  MAYBE if you
let the screen go for 5 minutes or more it'd pull out of the problem.  You
might also try lowering the resolution to 640x480 and turn off every bell &
whistle.  But don't get your hopes up.
