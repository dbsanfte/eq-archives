Weird, Im in EQ in windows 98 with a riva tnt 16 meg for gads sake and
umbra works fantastic for me. I'm using the newest nvidia drivers. 

The thing to remember is umbra works WITH clipping. If you have your
clipping set all the way out there someplace then you will be
rendering that far out (as far as you can see) unless you are in some
tiny room. I have clipping out a couple notches so I can see far
enough and due to umbra I run through shar vahl or shadow haven like a
bat out of hell. Before they got the umbra working, I could not move
in shar vahl and had to leave it was so laggy for me. Shar vahl and
shadow haven work the best with clipping and umbra of any zones I've
seen in EQ, they also probably will lag you the most if you run around
with clipping very high.

To really test if umbra makes a diff, set clipping all the way out
(this only works if youdon't have umbra disabled, though) as far as
Possible so you can see clear across shadow haven. Get to a good spot
where its quite laggy, near a small enclosed room. Go in the room and
turn and run around and such, your frame rate should have skyrocketed.
By the same token you can leave EQ, set UseUmbra=FALSE in your
eqclient ini under defaults, then get in and do the same test again.
This time you should be JUST as graphically lagged in the small room.
That is what umbra does and that is all it does. So if you run around
with your clipping near full, you are not going to notice a diff
during normal play unless you get in a small room and maybe it will
just be working your processor. 

For me its the difference between being able to play in Luclin cities
at all.
