I have run in to this problem for many moons with my Ranger.  My
solution is to target the add that no one is beating on and snare it,
then sit to get some more aggro.  He will usually come right after me.
 If not, run up and taunt, then cast another aggro spell.  Now I can
kite it away from everyone else.  As a Shaman, you can probably do
something similar.  Stand well far away from them both and slow the
add.  It will run to you and beat on you.  Now root it and get away. 
This may work even better once you get your AoE 50% slow.

My biggest frustration is when someone tries to ghetto mez the usual
way and makes it impossible for me to seperate the mobs.
