Ok Rambo; next time the US needs a revolution I hope your there to do as 
a one-man-show.

Hmmm... does this mean you beleive the US should have stayed away from 
Iraq. The Iraqis shouldn't need your help, and its treasonous of them to 
side with the US to get it; let them revolt on their own.

Straw man argument. I never asserted Tom Brokaw was smart. You wasted 15 
lines of text to make a valid attack on a claim I never made.

And you probably ought to stop taking yours; its clouding your brain.

The bush administration wanted to find and punish Osama bin Laden... so 
he bombed the hell out of Afghanistan when they didn't coorperate by 
handing him over to them.

Thank God the Oaklahoma bomber didn't hit China, because if the Bush 
admin didn't just hand him over to the Chinese for their unique brand of 
  'justice' without question you evidently think this justifies China 
bombing the shit out the US to drive the point home...
