Yep, we took down Rak for me last night, then hit Neh'Ashiir for another
shaman in the guild, and Jaxion for an enchanter.  It was painful to have to
stay there and do those other mobs with the last drop in my hands, and the
turn in mob just a zone away.  Also did Plasmatic priest, and Ixiblat before
that for one of our clerics.  Ragefire coming up soon, then we will have two
clicky clerics.
