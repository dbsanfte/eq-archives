I  have a level 24 Dwarven Cleric.  And have the same results.

My cleric started his life with 2 HB and switched to 1 HB later (level 15+).

My offence, deffence, dodge and other melee skills have increased regularly.
However 1HB and 2HB are VERY slow to increase.  I dont know if this is due
to the race or the class or a combination of the two.

I've come to the conclusion that clerics are not meant to melee and are best
meant for group situations where they can play the role of a true healer
simply by sitting back and keeping the reste of the group alive.

This can be extremely boring... So what I have brought myself to become
quite good at pulling the mobs for the group to kill... I pull, the tank
interupts and the group kills...  and I stand behind the group healing and
buffing as needed.

Good luck fellow cleric.
