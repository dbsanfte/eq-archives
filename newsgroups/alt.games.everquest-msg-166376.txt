The only other times I have had that feeling is when I was camping Pyzjn 
off and on.  My heart raced just as quickly on the 33rd / 34th time I saw 
her as it did on the 1st time.  You'd think I would get used to it.

I still agree with your assumption.  I'd like to see how the tower guy fits 
in, but can't logically do it.  Someone else on here ( Daniel? ) says the 
tower guy is killed at a specific time and then you kill specific types of 
mobs.  If he would mention the time and the types of mobs, I'd give it a 
shot again to see if it works.

In a situation where I am going to be getting a lot of resists, I was 
definitely worried about getting someone killed ( right after I get killed 
).  If that 60 chanter hadn't been there right when I showed up, it would 
have been a wipe and I would have been the napkin.  I didn't know that most 
of the stuff wouldn't be red until after a few pulls.  Got my heart to slow 
down some.

Heh.

He had an advantage that I didn't - he knew the 60 chanter was still there.  
=)  That gave him time to root, knowing the 60 would take care of the 2 
extras.  The cleric is my guildmate and is part of our Hole raid group a 
lot of the times.  We hit The Hole with RNG, DRD, ENC, PAL, CLC and anyone 
else that wants to come.  The RNG and DRD are an incredible duo who have 
been gaming together since before high school ( they're 29, now ) and do a 
ton of root-parking.  I don't know if Cros ( the cleric ) picked up his 
root-parking tendancy from them or elsewhere, but I'm glad he was on it.

>Groups that know what they're doing are rare - hang on to them as long
>as possible.  =)

I leveled my original warrior up from about 23 to 45 with the same group 
and it was incredible.  You -know- what everyone is going to do in every 
situation, even if it's a new situation.  No panic, very very very rare 
deaths, and a lot of fun.  I'm hoping to get that again with my second 
incarnation of Draglorvin.

I'm not sure yet how much the range is going to help.  I'm going to try to 
solo some giants in Rathe with KEI to see how I do.  The range will help 
there in getting off a far tash and a root.

I just discovered the benefits of "Rampage" when soloing.  I never knew it 
had a 90pt damage buffer in it.  Sure helps when farming for tailoring and 
for keeping the pet alive when soloing a HG.

I've noticed Cros the cleric in KC quite a bit, so he may get me invited in 
again.  I have another level under my belt, so maybe some fewer resists =)
