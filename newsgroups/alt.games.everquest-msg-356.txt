Hi, to start off, I have been reading a few things here and there about the
game besides what others who play tell me and it seems like there are
certain contradictions to playing this game.  A friend of mine had a few
gift certificates and decided to use em on me and I opted to get EverQuest
from BestBuy.  They have a return policy that says opened games are not
returnable.  From what I have asked and heard, it seemed like EQ could run
okay with standard equipment such as generic built-on graphics card and
soundcard.  In coming here and reading a few posts however, it seems that
quite a few people are complaining about the game running in an extremely
lagging fashion.  I am asking for any advice on what is the best thing I
should do before I open up this game.

I have a PII 400 pc (with mmx technology - if it matters), with quite enough
hd space for the installation.  The graphics card is an Ati Rage Pro without
any extra mem. chips added( can hold up to 8 more megs I believe).  I am
currently running win98.  The sound card is integrated onboard and is
something like an ESS 189???

Not too sure what all this will lead up to, but if anyone thinks my comp.
can handle the game, feel free to let me know since I did get it with intent
to play it at first.  If, however, it seems that the majority of the
playgroups run accelerators and it is deemed as such to do so just for good
play, then I may have to return the game to instead get a Baldur's Gate II
or something like that.

And if it helps to add, I play Starcraft online and it gets laggy sometimes
during multi-player games...especially when 8 people play.  Any kind of
information like a cheap but good grfx card is welcomed...even information
on what I should stay clear from is nice to have.

Thank you and hopefully I will be able to join in the games soon....I just
gotta fight the urge to open up the box now....I think I will give in
regardless.......
