To each his own I guess.  If I was having a good time doing the xp grind, it
had everything to do with the people I was grouped with and joking around
with, and nothing to do with the fact that I was grinding xp.  The tough
fights on the other hand, are fun, whether soloing, grouping, or raiding.
Taking down a mob that takes every last bit of mana, and most of my health,
is fun.
