Hello There, Ssarrs here :-)

Here is what I usually do.

1  If case doesn't have it installed already, PSU into the case.
2  Install CPU on to the motherboard.
3  Install the heatsink onto the CPU
         Several things to check here.
         You said the heatsink had that square of whatever it is in lieu of 
      	thermal paste. Did you remove the plastic protector tape that 
usually 		covers this?
4  Install the fan onto the heatsink.
5  Install the memory
6  Install the mobo into the case.
7  Install video card.
8  Attach monitor to video card.
9  Plug in mouse and keyboard.
10 Attempt to boot the system to see if it gets to the BIOS setup screen
11 If it does, then I proceed to install the floppy and HD, CD's next.
12 Install the OS (Windows or Linux)
13 My next step is to install the audio card, but yours was onboard.
14 Install other cards, reading mobo manual to see which slots share IRQ's

That should do it. Are you getting anything on your monitor at all? If the 
fans are not turning, then they are not getting power. Both the case and the 
mobo should come with manuals showing where the various leads go. In reference 
to the case, it is often a single sheet of paper and the english is usually 
very convoluted to say the least. The mobo manuals are usually very detailed 
these days. If you didn't receive either, then call your supplier and yell! 
The case should have several small leads that plug into the mobo to allow the 
start button, reset button and any LED displays to work. You need the 
instruction sheet! Sometimes, if the leads have names stenciled on them so you 
can infer with the help of the mobo manual where each should go.

Carefully read the mobo manual and follow their step by step instructions 
regarding attaching power to the mobo. The fans, which you state have 4-plug 
male AND female are to be daisy chained in this case to the matching plugs 
from the PSU. Does the fan on your heatsink have a 4 plug connector or a small 
2 or 3 pin connector? Sometimes you must connect this to the corresponding 
connector on the mobo or you'll see the mobo light come on indicating it's 
getting power, but it won't proceed to the boot stage without a lead connected 
to the fan pins near the CPU on the mobo.

Sorry for the twisted explanation, but let me know how it goes.
