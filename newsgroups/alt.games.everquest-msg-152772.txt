    I was about to cut into you, but Bergh also didn't get this so maybe my
terminology isn't clear.

    A "safe spot" is a spot one can stand where the mobs cannot path to you,
but think they can. They will stand there, stupidly, while you nuke them to
death or DoT them to death. It is exploit heaven. NO such spot should exist
in the game. Patching these out should be one of the top priorities, since
they trivialize the game in a way almost no other bug can match.

    I've reported a series of safe spots in Marus Seru. They are still
there. I still see people use them late at night, when no GM will come to
warn them or ban them.
