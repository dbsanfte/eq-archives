Bathory, other good exp places you might consider:
West Commons - you can kill lots of wisp's and there is usually a few
people hanging out at the derv's cut-throat camp ready to group.
Really good exp here. ( dont try to solo the derv's camp )  Druid ring
real close by is a great place to heal, and if you get in trouble, you
can run through there shouting help and some high lvl will usually
step in and save your butt, if not, at least it's a real easy place to
retrieve stuff from your corpse.  :-)
Crushbone - back right corner - kill orc slavers - great exp points
here. You might locate a buddy you can take turns with killing the
spawns and watching out for each other. You are just a touch low for
the occasional Orc Legioneer or taskmaster that spawns there, but if
someone is there to keep you healed during the fight, you will exp
pretty quickly.  You can solo here, but keep SOW cast, because you
will have to zone occasionally.  
Ocean of Tears - Get on the boat in Butcherblock headed to Freeport,
right after zoning into OOT, you will see some rocks on the right.
Swim to the middle rock, it's deserted.   Look at the rock on your
left, you will see two water goblins and two sirens.  The goblins will
give you so so exp, they are more a nusiance than anything else, but
the sirens will give you alot of exp at your level.  ( I'm assuming
you have pretty good AC, ignite spell, all your buffs, and a good
scimitar or equiv weapon )  DO NOT get off the rock while fighting or
chase anything into the water. You do not want to die in the ocean. If
you don't know how to swim, find a safe place to practice before doing
this one.  Oh yea, one last thing, your malee weapon must be magic,
such as a combine scimitar. You cannot malee Sirens with non-magic
waepons.
