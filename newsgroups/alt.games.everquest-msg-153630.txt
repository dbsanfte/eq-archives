As a followup, heres some reactions from epic arch-mages in a high end
raiding guild.

i hope we get somethin, otherwise this blows for us, i used to drop rods,
then nuke some, click my boots, then rod some more, and when oom click
boots. now i will have to sit there with the clerics targeted doing rods
every few seconds. least i wont be looking at the ceiling i guess..if they
dont give us somethin in return thers going to be a lot of pissed off mages
that decide to quit because their class is so fucked up and has no
definition.
*******************
Archo, mage nukes don't hit shit. I've had maybe 6 full dmg nukes in all our
AoW attempts. Forget it in ssra, full dmg is a joke. Personally I want the
title of second best damage dealer back.

You're missing the point on the "mage whining". If we can't hit shit now and
our only really good purpose was rods, then we have no purpose period. Guess
I'll get VoG/hp buffs/and another haste item and Melee on the big mobs with
my lure staff.

Mages have complained about our useless nukes on uber mobs since we started
hitting AoW class mobs. Check the mage tower's message board archives. At
least with rods, there was something we could do to actually help, now we
can sit and throw focus items at the mob, maybe that'll do some damage.
******
WRONG. Parse the damage on upper in raid quality mobs. I can do more fucking
damage meleeing than casting on them.

And for the final part about frenzied burnout pets. HELLO DO YOU PAY
ATTENTION. It does around 700 damage. 700, that's it. No more. The skill is
broken, all it is IS text. It's a neat, wow look at what that pet says it's
doing, skill. That's it. Hell, most of our AAs are useless like that. OH OH,
I wanna MGB ds...or wait, maybe u can give me a group rod spell...and I can
MGB it. How about pet hold...errr nm, easily accomplished with a hotkey
thanks for VIs current pet command code.
***********************
the no drop rods are going to suck ass either way. 1 charge at their current
ratio means the mage cant use them for himself. mages have such shitty self
mana regen, (less than every other priest or caster) that being able to self
rod was a godsend, and getting rune items or better regen made that even
better. now we cant do that, so we are stuck to 3 mana a tick regen from our
self buff, and what do the rest of the classes have? our soloing time will
now suck, all the mages with Shield of Auras no longer have good mana regen,
and targettable rod summoning will make raids even worse.

a short stop on rains, we have a rain for pop that is 800dmg for 800 mana,
nice ratio huh. we have 3 high lvl rains that are basically the same
currently, cause VI is too busy fucking up PoP to change them. same ratio,
same dmg, same mana cost, with a few variances. check out your pop rain, and
its excellent ratio.

AA skills, quick summoning, which most people got so they could drop rods
faster, now pretty gay. frenzied burnout-fun to see a pet fake flurry and
fake rampage. Mass group buff.-..... pet hold-useful ON OCCASION, but 6 pts?
fuck no. reagentless pets? woopy doo no more 6 silver component cost, and
useless for epic. elemental forms- once every 72 minutes, lasts 36, with
shitty bonuses? and 18 pts? im not gonna go into the rest, cause i bet u
dont want to read it.

on the issue of defensive skills, im not talking armor or leather, im
talking snare, root, mez, charm, sow, feign, any form of defensive aligned
spell designed to help a person prevent receiving an asskicking. our only
defense is a pet, which if we dont have up means we are fucked. ever been
attacked by a snow griff in ew? yea u can snare it or root it or do all
sorts of shit to it, i have to run. I barely made it to sleepers the other
day cause i had no pet up and a griffon kicked my ass all the way there. We
trade all those types of spells for offensive ability. That was the original
idea of the mage.

With each release our pets have fallen farther behind, and they just now got
them balanced. i am confident that pop will be no different, and our pets
will fall behind as people reach 65. then combine this with our shitty
nukes, btw check out our lvl 65 nuke, 1300 for 400 mana, and yours, 1395 or
1495 whatever it is for 380 mana. so a fucking druid who can half complete
heal can outnuke us too. and u have more nuke versatility at that. i dont
care what they give us, i dont want to be a damn wizard, but i want
something, since my main raid role is gone. basically now i will malosini
stuff, ds, which isnt all that great anymore, sic my pet which will soon be
dying in pop in all these "quick tactical fights", and try to land my shitty
1k pop nuke.

maybe this was what i needed to kick me off this game. I guarantee its going
to make lots of others leave, cause what the hell is there to look forward
to, taking a backseat on raids in which we used to play a critical, yet dull
as shit part. you cant completely change a person's role overnight and not
give them anything in return.

At least the damn wizards got an AA refund

We have no class definition, they don't know what to do to us. give us
better nukes and wizards whine, give us better pets and melees whine, give
us utility, well thers not much left to give without stepping on other
classes toes, and the one they came up with they decided to nerf. They have
no creativity in summons or pets. i swear to god they have no beta testers
who are mages. They've lost their desire, they've lost the vision they had,
and they don't care, cause EQ2 will come out soon.
