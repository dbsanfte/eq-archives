Point is, when they drew up the models for robe wearing classes they left 
out the HE because there *were* no robes they could wear. Operative word is 
*were*. Now that they have some robes they *can* wear there are no models 
for them. Kind of short-sighted. I think DT was referring to this and that 
it seems a bit "lazy" of them not to make all models for all races.
