First off you made the mistake of "root bombing" a red with your
Wizard. By the time you are hunting in the OT (mid-30s-early 40s) you
should know better than to over-agro early in a fight. 

Secondly you were in a pick-up group. You should NEVER expect the
players in a pick-up group to function like a well oiled machine, and
be able to cover mistakes (like nuke-agroing early). Even if the Ench
and Cleric were two different players, the chances are you would have
still taken a dirt nap.

Thirdly, a lot of people "bot" or 2-box. Some are so good that you
would never know unless they tell you, and others are useless. Players
who play only 1 character on 1 machine can be just as useless or even
worse than a bad "botter". Bad players are bad players.

Your mistake was not grouping with a "botter", it was over-nuking and
expecting the other members of the pick-up group to pull your bacon
out of the fire.
