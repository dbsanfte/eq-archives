I cant say for sure but it seems with my monk on average 10 AC seems to drop
the damage by about 3 points a hit. This was done by useing Jagged Bands
virsus Plat Fire Emerald Rings. Soloing Blues. I have done this several
times at Paw and it seems I end up with a half a bub more life. I will be
checking back I would like to hear other comments on this before I get rid
of 1 set of rings.
