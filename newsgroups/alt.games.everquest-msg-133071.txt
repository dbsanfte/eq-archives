I've found that interrupting spells isn't usually that big of a deal for
most exp fights, with the exception of CH, particularly seahorses in kedge
or 4 arms and robes in ME or dogs in Velks.  Usually they cast so fast that
you don't have time to notice and ghettobash anyways, or else whatever
they're casting is curable (particularly large shaman/necro dots, slow and
tash, though boil blood is damn annoying, particularly since for some reason
regrowth won't stick while it's up, even though boil doesn't overwrite
regrowth)

Anyways, if you hotkey secondary melee and a primary inventory slot with a
shield in it (for purposes of ghetto bashing a shiny brass shield (magic)
works fine), you can switch them really fast, particularly if you keep the
shield on your cursor and hands on the hotkey.   This assumes you're dual
wielding, otherwise it's a royal pain, becuase you need another hotkey for
primary weapon and it takes another 3 clicks (and some mouse movement.
