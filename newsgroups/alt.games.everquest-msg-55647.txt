I would suggest that you not skimp on DEX.  This is the main stat used for
determining how you fast you advance your Rogue specific skills.  There are
many STR enhancing items in the game, more so than any other stat I would
guess, so I would say half of what you would normally put into STR could be
put into WIS or INT whichever of the two is higher for the race you choose
to be.  If I were to create a new character right now and it were a Rogue, I
would try a Dwarf.  I would put 15pts to DEX and 10pts to STR and 5pts to
WIS.

Silvaira Lev 22 Halfling Rogue

Just for a comparison, my somewhat twinked Halfling Rogue has the following
stats // 122STR // 96STA // 168 AGI // 172 DEX // 84 WIS //

This character is by far the coolest one I have ever made, and deals out
more damage than any other character in the same level range.  The high dex
makes a huge difference in learning the Rogue skills, so for pete's sake
don't ever skimp on DEX!
