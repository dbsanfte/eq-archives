Gotta disagree with you on this one.  My love played a druid for a main for
years as main healer for our group (four IRL friends, playing
warrior/ranger/druid/enchanter.)  Even with Clarity (pre-KEI, pre-PoP, hell,
pre-Velious, we started right after Kunark came out) the healing downtime
was becoming excessive by level 40, even with chanter slows, runes, and the
ranger doing between-fight healing while the druid medded up.  By 45, the
druid had been retired and the group PL'd up a cleric, which my
light-of-life plays to this day (dinged 65 yesterday!  Grats, hun!)  But the
druid was and is 'more fun.'

Perhaps today, with KEI and vastly superior gear, a druid can act as a group
healer in an XP group past 40.  (And people here are saying KEI should be
nerfed so that it wouldn't stick at that level.)  Certainly the LOY spells
would help.  But with even with regen, ac buffs, and direct heals, a druid
is going to struggle between 40 and 60 trying to heal a group.
