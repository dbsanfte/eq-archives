Yep, I used to ride my bike several towns over in VA to go to a shop 
where they sold lead miniatures (in a frame shop of all places) and then 
several back the other way to go hang out at a friends playing various 
pnp rpgs, and back, almost every day.

Second I hit 16, I stopped biking cold; it meant hours more play time 
per day if I took my Ranchero instead, plus I could get to towns even 
further away that had previously meant a whole day invested.

Now I live in PA, and keep finding people that work for me who don't get 
their drivers liscences at 16... or 17 or 18.  I can't understand it, to 
us it was a rite of passage -and- a vast improvement in our amount of 
free time and our potential range.
