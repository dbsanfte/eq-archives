Find easier-to-get better weapons for the various levels:

1-35 - Fighting Baton - 8/20 - 300pp
36-50 - Knuckle Dusters (14/28) 1500pp, Wu stick (7/18 w/ stun proc) 1500pp,
Jade Mace (9/18) 3kpp
51+ - Jade Mace, epic fists (9/16), goranga club (12/23, free if you're
brave)

Lots more options out there that are easy to acquire too.

Add to that the fact that monks from 1 to 60 are on a better damage table,
and you can see how monks put out the best *consistent* damage of any class. 
Rogues can top monks, but require good conditions (most particularly a back
to stab).

Also, at most levels monks have higher skill caps than most other classes.
