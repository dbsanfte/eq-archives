Got a +3 Str augment for my 39 ranger and couldn't decide what to put it on.  
Most of my gear is just average and any of it could be swapped out at any time 
if something better came along.  So i wanted to put the aug on something i 
would be keeping for a while so I put it on my Lamentation sword.  Now the 
sword is No Drop and I realized my mistake right away.  If I ever want to sell 
the sword in the future I cannot unless the augment comes off.  Is this 
possible?
