To me it's more interesting that guides, who aren't complete (censored)'s
exist. Had two incidents so far:

1. Arrived at Firiona Vie on boat as an evil character. I knew there were guards
   at the dock so  my plan was to jump off the backside and swim to the coast in a
   big circle around the dock. What in fact happened is:
   The boat docked, but was runed 180 degrees. And yes, the exit ramp did no longer
   fit the dock (never seen that before). Then it suddenly yanked around 180 again,
   I fell through it into water WHACK WHACK a guerd in water killed me. All of this
   happened within 8 seconds or so. Guards answer: Yes happens, but you can't prove
   it, go away.

2. Same boat. Arrived at butcherblock. Waited for shuttles. One docks the ship,
   stands still. I walk twoards it ... and fall straight through it, finding myself
   under it in water. Now being level 12 (visited a friend in FV), I wasn't really
   fit for the zone. Anyway ... loaded up Timorous on my nearby laptop and swam
   (skill 12) ober to the Oasis shuttle (skill 56). I actually wanted to go to
   Feltwithe. Asked a guide: Yes that happens, we can't interact with the environment,
   sod off.
   Er .. hello ... I was a level 12, swimming at the FV boats position in a Zone, that
   (in /who) liste 6 people 50+ only, and that due to a known bug .. And i get no fricking
   help??? So, I *am* the one with a laptop, a guide, knowledge of where Freeport is and
   so on .. but I could have been a newbie without that, run itno something .. WHACK,
   dead on some timorous isle.

Those things led me to the conclusion, that guides are useless pricks paid for just 
about .. I dunno .. what are they paid for? I realize people could use this to cheat
themselves into cheap  transportation etc .. but come on, a level 12 in the ocean of
tear? How many people do you know being there 'out of fun' at this level?
