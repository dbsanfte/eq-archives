Thats a great page Zin.

I'd like it broken down into smaller pages so its easier to just
print one part, but I can edit the crap out of it to do so on
my own.

More glaring is the omission of the most important spell
haste in the game.  Yaulp V.  Whats the haste, and
what does it stack with?

I can have YV and Wonderous Rapidity icons both up
at once, for example, and I do see the boost to my dex
from YV.   Can't tell if I'm at 25% haste, (rumored haste
of YV) or 70% haste (your listing for WR) or 95% haste
(sum of the two) or 100% haste (add in haste off SBOC)
or some other combination.
