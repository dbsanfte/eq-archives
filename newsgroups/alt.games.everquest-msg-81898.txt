OK, fair enough, if you can use LOC.  However, I think that LOC works a 
HELL of a lot better if you know which direction you're going.  Sure, you 
don't need it to get from Freeport Newbie Zone to EC, but it's pretty damn 
nice to have when you're trying to find an NPC on an island in the middle 
of Timorous Deep.  The islands there are far enough apart that there are 
no landmarks to navigate by.  There are no paths to follow.  There aren't 
even any convenient and visable zone walls to follow.  
My issue is that at level 50+, unless you're a total gimp, you have a 
number of reasons to travel the world and the moon.  I don't expect that 
every person should be able to go everywhere by memory, but I expect that 
you know enough to be able to navigate familiar zones, and enough to be 
able to find your way around new outdoor zones.  Unless you do the 
treadmill of newbie zone, LOIO, FM, DL, KC, and never do any quests or 
anything, you will eventually have reason to travel.  Not knowing how to 
get around is just not reasonable.  Fine, you don't want to use sense 
heading, drop a weapon, cast true north, watch the clouds, something, but 
learn to read a map and learn to use LOC.
I've recently gone back and checked, I have spent at least some time in 
every zone on Norrath other than Sleeper's Tomb, and I plan to be there in 
the next couple months.  I still have several zones to hit on Luclin, but 
I am pretty sure that I have seen more zones than 99% of the people who 
play, so I may have a slightly skewed viewpoint.  I LIKE to travel, I like 
seeing new places, I like not having to do CR every time I go somewhere 
new.  If you're happy doing the exp grind, fine, but if you're working on 
your epics, doing high-end quests, or in a raiding guild, learn to travel, 
and for bristlebane's sake, learn to read a damn map!
Oh, and the karma fairy bit me in the ass last night.  I was enjoying my 
illusion erudite mask and running with regular selos so I was visable to 
anyone I passed, and talking on the phone, was traveling to Acrylia 
Caverns for the first time, and was running across Hollowshade Moor when I 
took 10k falling damage off a mountain.  Luckily I was bound in Bazaar, so 
it didn't take that long, and a cleric was able to rez me after the Ring 
of Fire was over.
