Sadly enough, it is not possible to defend anyone from this. You simply
can't defend from a suicide. Check the definition of suicide and you will
understand. As you state several times in this thread (w other words), the
evil is already unleashed, but it has ben there for years, and there is no
solution short term. Hunt terrorists? Of course they have to be hunted and
brought to justice (if such does exist). But by any means this will help in
defense nor prevention, new ones surely will appear like mushrooms. Please,
re-check the definition of suicide.

Wait, maybe I should remark that I believe this to be applicable to Europe
as well :-(
