No worries.  I'll look for you in a bit.  Its entirely possible the
corpse is still laying around!  If so, we can find it.

What you might consider is typing /who bard.  From the resulting list,
send some /tells to them (or just use /shout) and see if any nice
bards will use their locate corpse song for you.  If the bard can
target you, they can then play the song which will lead them to your
corpse...

I believe Necros can do something similar(?) but have ZERO necro
experience.


If that don't work, no worries.  'tis only a game.  =)
