With the drive to make a fair profit.  Just because someone doesn't see the
need to squeeze every penny out of the customer, doesn't mean they won't say
"I think the service I provide is worth this much, at a fair price, so
that's what I'll charge."  The idea of "what the market will bear" is one
way of determining the fair price... ie, if someone will buy it for that
price (and your competitor doesn't undercut you, then the price is fair.

Much the way they do now.

In other words, "It looks like there is no market for me here."  The
developer's got a few choices.  He can either move on to someplace where
there is a market for him.  He can adapt his services to meet the needs of
the community.  Or, he can take a chance that people do want that turnpike
and strip mall.  I'm thinking if people use them enough to make them
profitable, than he just might be justified.

I'll admitt, it's been nearly a decade since I read the Communist Manifesto.
None the less, there seemed to be a strong sentiment of statism, on various
levels.   He spoke of the worker taking control of the means of production.
That bypasses the business owner, and removes the significance of private
property (since the worker now takes the profit from the owner).  With no
owner and managment, we're left with anarchy, or the intervention of the
government.  Collectives, such as farms, require some form of government, to
ensure that work is distibuted, and that all things are done that need to
be.  That leaves only mom and pop stores to the private owner.
