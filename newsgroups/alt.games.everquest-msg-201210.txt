Well, either you guys group with much better druids than I do or
you're just hitting spots where you're overpowered for your lvl.
Remember that we're talking a pre-58 druid with chloroblast as the
best heal. Some I'll buy like SG or the Deep, you don't need much
healing there in a lot of the camps. A few more I might buy with a
chanter to slow and/or a 60+ tank with lots of AA. 

Not that I'm knocking druids, I'm usually grouped with one as main
healer in our groups. I was replying to:

... and I still call bullshit on that one unless your in a boring,
lets-pull-singles all day camp. 

Rgds, Frank.
