Hi everyone, just want to say thank for you info up front. As the subject
says I am a 42 druid looking for a group. Yes I know that druids are good at
quad kitting and such and they get pretty good exp for it. However, I am not
fond of it. I enjoy grouping with others, agreed the experience might not be
the worlds best but hey gotta give and take I guess. Most of the time I am
partner up with a 40 ranger, that I have been with for say the last 25+
levels. So, where would be the best places for a 42 druid and a 40 ranger go
to find a group?


Thanks again!
