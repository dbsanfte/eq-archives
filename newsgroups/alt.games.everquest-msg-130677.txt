You sound like you were concerned with the show being on late enough that the
kids wouldn't see it. Now that's really funny since you invited couples to your
house for swinger parties and TOLD THEM to bring the kids. Want me to repost
the info?

Reminds me of a debate I got into with a cousin of mine that ended up
involving 50% of the family at a family reunion...

This was at the time when some family group was advocating a boycott
of McDonalds because they were a sponsor of MARRIED WITH CHILDREN..

Now, I thought the show was hilarious.  My cousin is one of those prim
and proper easily offended types (Love ya, cuz... :^)  hehehehe)

She supported the show being pulled. I felt it violated the rights of
those who DID enjoy the show.

It was on late enough that kids watching it really wasn't an issue..

But we debated that til 4AM and STILL didn't resolve the issue...
