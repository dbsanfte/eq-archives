You absolutely did the right thing.  That warrior is an idiot.  There is 
no way to survive when your tanks get charmed sometimes.  It is better 
to gate out and survive than to stay there and get pounded on by your 
friends.
The last time I was in a pickup group in Paw, same thing happened.  I 
was the ranger then, had a warrior, wiz and some kind of healer, think 
it was a druid.  Warrior turned on the wiz and took him out in 2 hits. I 
  couldn't see what was happening after that.  Luckily, I got stuck up 
against a wall and didnt' kill anyone.  The healer gated out while the 
warrior was beating on him. Then the other group in there sends tells to 
us, 'why you come attack our healer?  We didn't do anything to you.'  I 
laughed so hard I fell out of my chair.  That was my first and hopefully 
last time I was charmed.
