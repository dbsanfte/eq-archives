 I've spent at least 14 hours doing faction work in Droga over the past
few weeks. Still scowling to all Sarnaks but I think I'm getting close!
I hope, anyway.

 I'm also hoping the newest NPC changes with this patch will actually
make faction farming in Droga even easier than it used to be. At 60 with
3200 hp self-buffed they easily could get me to 1-2 bubbles if I had a
couple casters on me. Maybe now I'll be able to resist more of the
nukes.
