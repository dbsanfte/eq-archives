See my post to TwoHead.  I did not assume that a guide
can't do a thing remotely (although my one farcical example
may have given that impression), my actual point was
that wherever a Guide might be hanging out, there are
more fruitful places he could be watching over than
checking whether or not someone might be using a Soulbinder
as a sparring partner.  To me that indicates that their
priorities are out of whack.

Thank you, James.
