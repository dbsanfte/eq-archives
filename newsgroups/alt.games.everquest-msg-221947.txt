The real problem, I suspect, is that SOE simply isn't willing to pay
for enough GMs, thus the few we have are spread far too thin. They've
completely abandoned enforcing the naming policy, for example, no
doubt simply because they don't have enough manpower.

EQ is a profit center for SOE, nothing more. As long as it keeps
profits up, it's in their best interests to have the absolute minimum
number of GMs possible.
