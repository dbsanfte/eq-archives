 Also worth mentioning is that that you should con all the live mobs you
see while on your way down to the tunnel. A lot of those spiders
see-invis. If you have sow and know the way you could probably just
train your way down there and back.

 Usually he is. Until Vekis pops and her pet shows up. I'm not sure how
sense undead works though. If it picks up the closest undead you should
be ok on the East side of the zone by the doggy hideout since that's
where AJ paths by.

 Depends on server and how many people are working on keys. I regularly
check that spawn when I run through there and he's seldom alive.

 A level 60 can pull him out solo (probably lower levels as well). So
that leaves only 3 others you have to clear first. Unless you're a class
that can slow him I think you'd have a hard problem soloing Verix. For
one thing, he summons so that leaves out root/dotting. He also hits
pretty hard. Also, unlike normal skellies he will run when he gets low.
This is bad if a Curate happens to come along and CH him. Plus he also
gates when he runs far enough away, which again is bad if you pulled him
solo because this time you'll probably get summoned and then jumped by
him and 4-5 more skellies. He's a fairly easy duo mob but I wouldn't
recommend solo.

 The good thing is that like unlike ToV, invis actually works (for the
most part) in VP so you normally don't even have to kill the yard trash.
And yard trash does have drops but they are spells. I don't remember if
the Racnars drop spells or not. If they did, Druushks lair would be a
good spell farming spot. If not there's always Pharas Lair. I know
Guardian Wurms drop them. And there's always the pool room if you like
having a safety margin.
