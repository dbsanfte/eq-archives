Interesting...yes, that sounds like what my coworker was talking about.
I'm not familiar with laws on negligance, but it sounds sensible.  Messy,
in a way, but not without reason.  Because like you say, if I went out of
my way to obstruct a red-light-turner or a merger, I shouldn't be able to
get away with it.

The question is where does the fault lie when the cell-phone-blathering
suburban driving insists on merging into me when he has had a chance to
speed up or slow down?  If I willfully refuse to adjust my speed so he
doesn't have to modify his driving and he hits me...am I being negligent?
In one sense I am...I could have avoided it and I was choosing not to.
For some reason I don't feel too repentent though.
