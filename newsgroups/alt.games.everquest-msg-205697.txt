Here's my 2 cents on corpse recovery: (2 ideas actually)

1.) The first is from an old single player game called Legends of
Valour. If I remember correctly, you could purchase 'notes' or 'writs'
or some sort of insurance so that when you died you could regain all
your equipment and stats. It's been so many years that I don't
remember the exact mechanics, but I believe that's how it worked.

2.) You have a number of friends/guildmates pray for you and/or make
donations to an NPC priest/cleric who would then resurrect you. I like
the second one better as it promotes more community and would
hopefully cut down on the catass pop.
