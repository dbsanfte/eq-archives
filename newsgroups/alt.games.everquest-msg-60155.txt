IMO, "dispute" would be the wrong term.

I don't use that method myself.  I always make sure the group is buffed
and use myself as a timer.  Buffs are *always* up on everyone that
needs them that way or I know they're down, at least.   I don't heal
just to see full red bars.  If someone *needs* a heal, they need a heal,
not a buff.  (Heals are always going to give back more HPs unless you
use a lesser heal, one that I'd probably have to load.)

There's two issues:  do you have a space for the spell that can't be
used on something else you want?   I haven't had that luxury in quite
a while.   And, do you want to heal that many HPs anyway?  I don't.
If a caster (non-enchanter, anyway) isn't at full health, maybe they'll
be a bit more cautious about drawing agro next time.  IMO, keeping
them at full health when they're not in danger (and if they're in danger
you should be healing, not buffing) just encourages them to get agro
again.

At least IMO, the main benefit is you don't have to buff everyone at the
same time.  The problem with that is that you won't know (necessarily)
when the buff is fading or dropped that way.  I've had mages and wizards
let the buff drop because they never get hit, then had a bad pull where
they died because I couldn't get a heal off in time because they didn't
have those extra HPs.   If I'm going to have to re-buff the everyone when
my timer says it's down anyway, I'm not going to waste the mana doing
it at other times.

In short:  it works for some people, maybe even most.  It doesn't work
for me because it doesn't fit my style of play.   That line represents
maybe a quarter of a caster's health bar.   I don't heal casters at that
point, unless it's the enchanter, anyway.   The tanks are going to get big
heals because it's more mana efficient.

The one situation where I have refreshed that line early is when everyone
is a bit hurt and the group needs to be at full health before pulling.
That's
a rare occasion, though, and I'm just as likely to use a AoE heal instead.
For me, though, healing with that buff is a waste of mana.  If they don't
need a *heal*, they don't need HPs refreshed.
