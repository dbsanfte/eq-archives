*I'm submitting the following question to Verant, but I thought I'd ask here
as well.*

I'm getting and odd problem with EQ and the Kyro2, though it's nothing that
makes the game unplayable, it is a bit distracting. It seems that if you
move your avatar around any, and stop moving, the textures on the ground
start getting a "sliding back and forth against each other" effect.
Everywhere you look, the different texture blocks are "rubbing" back and
forth rapidly... it gives the odd effect of making the ground look like a
quivering mass of jello =)  The effect will only last for a few seconds and
then it stops and everything looks normal till you move again.

Any ideas? I've played around with the different settings and nothing seems
to help. I've also completely wiped the HD and reinstalled windows to try
and see if an old registry setting could have been causing the effect.

System config is 1.2 gig T-bird, Abit KT7A mobo with latest official bios,
256megs of ram, 4.31 via 4-in-1's installed in Turbo mode, 7.103 Kyro2
drivers, SBlive with latest drivers.

BTW, I realise that the card is new, and probably untested with EQ... I'm
just hoping for some leads to something that might help fix the problem I'm
having.

Regards,
Matt K
