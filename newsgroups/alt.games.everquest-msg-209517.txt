It works both ways.  My level 25 cleric was TOLD by several groupmates to go
GET a KEI, (before the nerf).  Untwinked, I couldn't afford KEI.  And I'm
embarassed to pay less than 50 PP for one anyway!  I thought it was damn nervy.
 Especially since I was on my BUTT the whole time, not looting, and no one
OFFERED to share the expense of one.
Needless to say it was time for me to log off for a bit.
