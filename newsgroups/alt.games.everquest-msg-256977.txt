A tanking rogue.   Don't let the rangers hear.  I can only take people going

Probably depends how sure you are about your aggro control.    The only
really dangerous part about the TZ in the script is his AE, which is
directional.   As long as your tank (Usually use a paladin for this part of
the fight even) maintains a good aggro lock, you can melee his back to your
hearts content.   Out of 5 or 6 RZ kills, I've only seen him turn around
once... so probably pretty safe to do.

The Tallon Zek who pops by himself is another matter entirely.

Only did Sol Ro once, but I don't remember it being ranged.   Or there being
any significant damage shield by the time attack was called..  I could be
wrong though, it was a long time ago.   Never fought the other two.

*shrug*  A lot of "ranged" fights like Fennin could be turned into mixed
ranged melee fights, if your melees are smart and paying attention.
Sadly, this isn't always the case though.   I do try to push it as much as
possible, since I really hate that useless feeling I get in ranged fights
=P~   But I acknowledge that no matter what the raiding group, theres always
at least a few melees who just flip on auto attack then go to watch the
ballgame.
