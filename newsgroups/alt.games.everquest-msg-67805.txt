I've had a spider in Velk's turn invisible while we were fighting it,
all I could see was the name tag (kinda like shadowed men). And during
my guild's recent VS raid, chunks of the assorted spectral guys would
turn invisible so I could see a doorway and the width of the ledge
above/around the VSR room clearly through the mob. This is with a
Voodoo 3 2000 card.
