OK, shall we all agree to go /shownames 3 and lose the irritating Baron tags?
Baron Bergh isn't so bad, but 90% of the names out there sound rediculous
with Baron in front of them... and Venerable is worse.  Whats the one
above that?  Hmm, not sure I want to know, and with /shownames 3 on
I'll never have to!

I liked the brackets.  Oh well, losing the * will be nice

Heh, Mushrooms in Fungus, I bet?

BEYOND EXCELLENT.  I can't tell you how tired I am of typing
out /tell Illixiblats are you ready for res?  Just being able to /tell
people I target is going to be nice, but /ttell corpse is going to be
very nice to my developing case of carpal tunnel... and probably
double my speed in doing mass res.  If I had a res stick, it would
quadruple my speed!

Couldn't care in the least.  As stupid as the different pet commands that
do the same thing.

THey didn't before?  Stack with what?  I thought that FT, Clarity, bard
song, and AA mana all stacked... hmm, does one FT item now stack
with another?  That would extend caster endgame as they could now
pursue an FT item for each slot...

WHICH IS WHAT?  Now I get to test this all over again.  It sure
didn't do a thing before, nice to have it confirmed that it was broken.

Rumor has it that stun spells with a knockback component will interrupt
casters even if the casters cannot actually be stunned.  When I tried it,
the stun damage thing must still have been broken, cause literally nothing
happened... anyone confirm or deny the rumor since the fix?

Nice, although the autobinder spot in SH is still mighty handy spot
for -everyone- to bind. Wonder if bind others works in Nexus?

Cool, I use click pants and click arms for heals almost constantly, this will
help my poor beleagured takns keep their targetting on the prize.

Interesting, they've said that timers of this sort are there to increase the
virtual size of the world.  Speed up the spire cycle time and you make
the world just  a little smaller... isn't that the opposite of what they
say they want?

For me though, this is great... wait for boats and wait for spires is
-not- content, its just an irritation.  There is plenty of waiting in
the game already, but at least a lot of it occurs in areas with
some risk.  Total safety coupled with an inability to do anything
useful or amusing is just annoying.
