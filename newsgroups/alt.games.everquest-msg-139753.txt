Well, I'm level 60 with 200 in evocation specialization. My opinion, go for
conjuration. :) I just found the joys of chain summoning pets. I now kill
much faster. With the new xp rules, you only have to do 1 point of dmage to
get xp, so I hardly nuke. Plus, it helps with our "ghetto mana regen" that
involves MSII.

I'll probably be switching soon... What a pain!
