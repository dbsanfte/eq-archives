AA is Alternate Advancement.

Once you are past level 50, you get the choice of continuing to gain levels
like normal, or you can choose to gain "Alternate Advancement" abilities
instead.  You save up AA points to buy specific improvements to your
character, instead of the generic "level" improvements.  Which AA you can
purchase depends on which class you are.  Casters can buy faster mana regen,
critical spell hits...etc.   Warriors can buy more critical hits, the
ability to Area Effect Taunt, etc...  things like that.
