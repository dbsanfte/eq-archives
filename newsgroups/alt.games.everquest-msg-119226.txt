Its worth point out that dispell will NOT remove slow anymore from mobs

Slow recently got changed, now cure disease is the spell which removes slow.

That has a major impact on the difficulty level of Sontalak... he was one of
very few mobs that would dispell *himself*.

He would regularly remove slow (and all dots/some debuffs etc), and was
never easy to slow in the first place...  now when slowed, hes slowed for
the spell duraction

Dispell removes all other stuff (snare, root, charm, magic based dots, MoK
etc) for poison/disease/cured based dots though, it won't have any effect
