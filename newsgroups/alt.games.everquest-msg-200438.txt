The way I read it ZEM's in general are not being nerfed, but the pop zones
are.  POP zones probably had too high a zem to start out.  Whether it was a
mistake or intentional to get people to try out unknown territory, the
effect of making so many people feel like pop zones are the only zones worth
going to is not a good thing.  Balancing risk/reward for pop zones to make
them match the Norrath/Luclin zones is a good thing.
