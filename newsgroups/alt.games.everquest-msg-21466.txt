Ummmmm...... Sui? That was more of an exaggeration than anything, just to get the
point across that I doubt we'll ever see a 7/1 weapon, and it would tear through
too many high level mobs like a chainsaw through butter.  Ten shots a second for
the kind of damage my warrior can put out with a seven damage weapon? It would be a
blur.

We can start that debate again if you like. <g>  Still waiting to hear one that
isn't a FoaF story.  Closest I've come is hearing it from a member of a guild on
another server than mine who's guidmaster claims to have solo'd a named dragon with
their bard.
