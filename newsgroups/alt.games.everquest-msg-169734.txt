You should have seen her 1-2 times in that time if you were following the 
"Pyzjn Hunting Guide," but that's how the RNG goes sometimes.  I've seen 
her 5 times in 5 hours before, and then not seend her once in that same 
amount of time.

I definitely wouldn't camp her if they are selling less than 1.5 - 2k.  The 
time invested ( on average ) can be better spent somewhere else.

Glad you got your INT item.  I'm hoping I'll be able to replace mine 
someday.  I -still- have that and a Stein of Mogguk in my hands.  I did 
have my GL hand me a Hive Fiend's Brain to put in range, though, which was 
quite nice of him.
