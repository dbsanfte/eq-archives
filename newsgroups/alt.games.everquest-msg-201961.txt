Sorry if this has already been mentioned, but I found this at:

regarding some of the changes with the upcoming patch on June 11:

====================

5) Shared bank vault will be added. There are times when a player
wants to trade items from one character to another. In the past making
such a trade may have included dropping items on the ground or asking
a friend to hold them for you. To make such trades more convenient, we
are adding two shared bank slots to the interface. Any character on
the same account and server can access these extra bank slots. No-Drop
items can't be placed in these bank slots, and only one of any
specific Lore item can exist in the shared bank at any time.
