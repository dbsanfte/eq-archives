So, if they're intentionally booting people to desktop when they sit
in /trader mode in the Bazaar, explain to me why it's never happened
to me, who has set up all night in the Bazaar several times over the
past week? Why are there people that have been there, as far as I can
tell, constantly for the past month? The complaints of boots to desk
to have been, from what I've seen, the minority. If they're booting
traders to desktop, why doesn't it happen to *everyone* who leaves a
character in /trader mode for extended periods?

Back up your claims or admit you're talking out of your ass. Don't
throw out the flimsy "If I tell they'll fix it" bullshit excuse. It's
completely transparant, boy.
