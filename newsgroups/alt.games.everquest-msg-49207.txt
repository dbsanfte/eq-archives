The minor differences in the DAoC game engine do nothing to compensate for
the fact that PvE fighting in that game redefines boredom.

Plus, the minimized downtime only applies if nobody in your group is
fighting. If someone in your group is killing something (and you are in
close enough proximity to get xp), you have NO REGEN AT ALL!!!!
No "hold on, medding up for one last heal!", which I happen to find
enourmously fun in EQ.
