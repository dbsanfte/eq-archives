Fishing skill can help with making fishbone darts... whici are a useful 
LONG RANGE throwing itew.  Very useful for monks.   Arguably it could be 
said that fresh fish could be used for fish rolls (but you can buy fresh 
fish real cheap).  For a while it was useful in Ocean of tears.  I used 
to get 40pp each for saltwater sea weed, but noone makes that armoe anymore.
