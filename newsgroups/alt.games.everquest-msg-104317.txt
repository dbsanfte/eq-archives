   gimp [3]  (gimp)  n., v. <gimped, gimp-ing> Slang
            n. 
               1.  a limp.
               2.  a person who limps; lame person.
              v.i. 
               3.  to limp; walk in a halting manner.
          [1920-25, Amer.; orig. uncert.]

Thus, a "gimped" zone is one that has been allegedly
crippled in some way, or made "lame" in the sense of
#3 or #4 below:

lame [1]  (laym)  adj. <lam-er, lam-est> v. <lamed, lam-ing>
              adj. 
                  1.  crippled or physically disabled, esp. in 
                       the foot or leg so as to cause limping.
                  2.  being stiff and sore: a lame arm from 
                       playing tennis.
                  3.  weak; inadequate: a lame excuse.
                  4.  Slang. out of touch; square.

Applied to a person, it can mean a "lamer" (again, definitions
#3 or #4), or as Freeman points out, a reference to the
freak in the movie Pulp Fiction.
