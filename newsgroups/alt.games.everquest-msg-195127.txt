I have to agree that bards are NOT an easy class.  Playing bard for the
first time (I'm up to level 34) and I have never had to focus as much on
what was happening around me with any other class I've played.  Constantly
having to watch my songs so I can start new ones.  And changing songs
constantly for various situations and groups.  That being said, however, I
am having a great time with the bard.  I seem to have learned some of the
finer points as I've had group members tell me they hadn't realized bards
could be so helpful.  I am a half-elf and I don't feel that I've lost out in
any way to being a Vah Shir.  Of course, they better inate fighting skills,
but there is far more to being a bard than that.
