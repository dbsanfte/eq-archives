Actually you should SOW the bards in a group as far as I know, if you
are lower level and might suddenly be attacked by a griff or
something. I mean everyone else will be running while the bard has to
hit his run song button, switch out weapons to drum to move faster,
etc.

As far as the mana song it kind of depends, really if everyone can hit
the mobs okay and rapidly enough as it is you'd probably do better to
play it all the time if you have clerics sitting.  The thing is that
its suprising how many bards you have to tell to play the mana song
INBETWEEN fights when everyone is just sitting there and you need
mana. Many of them seem to forget which is why people are always
telling them.

As far as chanters casting clarity there are eventually a few bard
things which require mana, would that help them? I'm not sure if that
is a habit you'd actually want to break...
