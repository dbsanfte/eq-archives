Is that the thing that shows up when I type "/claim" as something like "EQ1
picture for house and server name title"?

If so, then note that I cancelled my EQ1 account over a year ago, I believe,
and have the title thing showing up in /claim.  I believe you get it if you
use the same Station account you used for EQ1, regardless of whether you
actually have an active EQ1 account.  So, a lot of those people could be
people who left EQ1 long ago, like me, but remembered their Station name and
password and used that for EQ2 rather than makeing a new Station account.
