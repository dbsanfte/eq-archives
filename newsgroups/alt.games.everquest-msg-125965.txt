}In combat there's no problem, as you get the "cannot forage while attacking"
}message.

See, I always considered that a problem, which is why I un-mapped forage 
from my right-arrow key...  The problem is that it also greys out the 
forage key so I waste a whole forage cycle.

So I just hit 7 (maped to forage) a lot, or if I'm attacking, F11 (mapped 
to attack), 7, F11.

F11 probably wasn't the best choice for attack key since it's also the 
toggle for the little ping indicator, but it's so habitual I'm stuck with 
it now. :)
