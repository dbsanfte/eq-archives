PvP in EQ (or any MMORPG) draws less on player skill and more on how much
they have achieved in game, especially for Melee classes where the best toys
rule. This isn't even taking into account the lack of class balance for PvP,
that's not a knock on EQ which was never made with PvP in mind, whereas DAoC
was and that STILL has crappy class balance for their PvP. I think PvP
servers could be fun to play on, as long as you were ok with running into
the odd griefer without it ruining your (gaming) day, you might want to turn
off the shout and ooc channels as well :ï¿½)
