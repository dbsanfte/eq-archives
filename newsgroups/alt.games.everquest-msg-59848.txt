I bought this the other night for 1500pp hoping to turn around and sell it
for 1700 (quick profit).  Now people are telling me that it isn't woth jack
crap.   It's a 2hb with a nice delay/damage ratio.  The weird thing about it
is it looks like an axe.  Are these all that common & am I crazy to think
I'll get my money back out of it?  I haven't seen that many of them on the
market.

I hate getting burned on a trade.
