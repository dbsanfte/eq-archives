  Give me a break.  I don't "repeatedly post whines."  I will sometime
respond to someone else's rebuttal to clarify my points, which are often in
defense of Verant.  I have already admitted twice that calling them "liars"
was taking it a bit far, but that is ignored and I'm insulted and ridiculed
just because I happen to hold an opposing opinion.  That doesn't create a
very good climate for respectful and constructive discussion.  But then I
guess that's not what most people come here for.
