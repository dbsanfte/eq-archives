Ain't THAT the truth.

Yes, very much par for the course. Even after all these years, I still
boggle at the ineptitude Sony display when adding content, because it
goes wrong EVERY single time, lol.  We all think "Right, a big patch
on Wednesday, hmmm, 11 hours... OK, actually allow 12 to 18 for the
patch, then maybe add two days, so the patch of the patch's patch
actually gets it up and running.  Expect another patch in about 4 days
to iron out new bugs that have emerged.  Should be reasonably OK to
try something new in, oooooh, about two weeks or so"  :D
