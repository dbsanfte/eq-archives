That seems the most likely.

I remember vah shir and iksar being greyed out in character select on
discord, so I don't think you could even select them.

As for the exploiting, there have been several bans, and GM's are still
asking for people to 'tell' on the exploiters, to ban even more people!!

They also say that they are developing ways to 'stop' such cheating and
exploiting in the future.  MY guess is they'll just stick 'please do not
cheat' sign-posts across all old world zones ;)
