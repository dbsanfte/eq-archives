I never argued with the claim that it puts stress on a guild. I can 
certainly see where it might. I just maintain that that stress can be 
minimized

I don't understand how actually participating in the trials suddenly 
opens this door of enlightenment that is impossible have even crack 
otherwise. I completely agree that the trials need tuning. However, even 
in the absence of such fixes, I don't feel they should be removed. No one 
needs to even try to tell me how it is just too hard when people are 
getting flagged every day and not just those in the uber guilds.

I'll gladly drop this fruitless discussion when my opinions are no longer 
attacked with nothing more than testimonials of how so-and-so's guild 
split up because of it or so-and-so's guild couldn't field enough 
adequate-level players to complete the trial. There is no information 
testifying to the quality of these guilds in the first place. I maintain 
that if a guild is what it should be, it can make it happen given the 
necessary time and effort.

I can handle disagreement, but the pompous condescention is a bunch of 
crap.
