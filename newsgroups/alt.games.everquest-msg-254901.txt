Air pet parses seem to bear you out:

According to parses the effective mob delay against an
air pet is 31, against an earth pet it's 25  (both summoned
with Time level focus - this is also before the mitigation
changes, but those didn't effect this.)

That is, the mob strikes 80% as often against an air pet.

Air pet stun is 3 seconds - parses show he casts it every 16
seconds.  So the stun is responsible for taking 3.2 seconds
of offense away from the mob on average.
