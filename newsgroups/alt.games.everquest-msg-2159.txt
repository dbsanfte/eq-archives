Ick, analogies. However, this is a bit like arguing whether the "Free
Gift" in your packet of Cornflakes is 'Free' or not. If you have to buy
something to get a 'Free' thing, it is most definitely not free. Buy
one, get one free? Bollocks. 50% off if you buy two.

To further the analogy, I can empathise with Scott. I don't want to
spend my cornflake money on 'free' gifts, I'd rather I got more
cornflakes for my money. Verant can stick their 'free' gifts up their
arse. It would also seem Scott feels he isn't getting enough cornflakes
to begin with. Again, I can empathise.

Still, if the games included are distributed freely elsewhere, then yes;
it's harder to see why he's complaining.
