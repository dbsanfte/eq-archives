Druid/Warrior.

Unstoppable at all levels, able to travel
safely from level 14 on (plus ports, later),
and a welcome duo in a group or backbone
for a group all the way to level 50.

With druid, you keep your tracking, and
he always has that taunt button.

Druid/Necro or Druid/Mage is good, too.
3 person group for the price of 2, plus
travel benefits.
