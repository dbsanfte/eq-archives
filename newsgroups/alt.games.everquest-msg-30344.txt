From the original post:
In your opinion at level 57+ what are the most wanted classes in a raid?
(Raid = an ubber raid mob, in a zone like the sleepers or something...)

In the raids the OP was referring to, warrior *is* vital. If you don't
have 2 warriors and 2 clerics are a BARE minimum, don't even bother.

A bard can fill in for a warrior for a grand total of 20 seconds. 18
seconds of invul song, 2 seconds of combat. Then they're dead. Of
course, since the invul 'enhancement' they won't even be tanking for 17
of those seconds, so make that 3 seconds. Enchanters certainly make
things easier and C2/VoG/SotS is required on the toughest mobs, but you
can at least make a start on places like ST or ToV while waiting for one
to show up. Try having a Bard tank MotG with druid healing...
