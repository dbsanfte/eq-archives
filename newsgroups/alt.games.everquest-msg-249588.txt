No, not a huge deal, especially since it is useful information for a lot of
people.   But you have to admit it was /just a bit/ out of control.

The biggest thing that bothers me is less this actual sig, rather than the
whole "I don't want this place to turn into a webboard type place" type
thing. One of my chief complaints there being tiny little posts of
information or conversation, buried in massive threads filled up with
nothing but great big signature pictures, the same three pictures repeated
over and over and over again.
