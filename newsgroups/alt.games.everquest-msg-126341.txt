>Also nice, but probably Not Enough to suit me>>

In general, I thought the overall *feel* of the  new GUI was refreshing. While
not perfect and certainly it won't please everyone in every aspect, it will add
to my enjoyment of the game, and it will, to one extent or another, add to the
game's playability.

Just a personal opinion.
