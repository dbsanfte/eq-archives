Apples & oranges.  Quake is a first-person-shooter in a non-persistent
world with nothing like the number of players in a MMOG like EQ or AO.
Grief players aren't an issue in Quake, since the whole point of the
game is to kill everyone else.

Maybe AO & DAoC will get PvP right: DAoC is still in beta, and while AO
is out now, it's still a little early to judge how well PvP will work -
in any case I cancelled my AO account a couple of weeks ago.  Not due
to PvP problems, more that I just didn't think the game merited paying
a monthly subscription.
