My chanter is 66, but not at the level of the guys who were
complaining... I haven't seen their kind of issues yet.  But basically
what they were saying was that chanters had 2 main abilities: charming
for huge dps, and crowd control.  Apparently many mobs are either
marked as non-charmable, or their damage when charmed is very limited.
And the combination of single-pulling of mobs in OoW and mez resists
mean that chanters aren't as useful as other classes for crowd
control.  

So the main use of chanters is dropping buffs on people, which isn't
hugely in demand, or very exciting.  

I'm not in that spot, and not likely to be for a looonnnnngggg time,
but I understand their point.
