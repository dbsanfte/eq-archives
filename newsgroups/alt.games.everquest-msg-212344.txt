Sure is. But its totally arbitrary. But these people aren't worth 
arguing with because they refuse to think, simply falling back on a wall 
of faith.

"Some things I accept on faith, other things I seek to overcome with my 
faith, and I rely on faith to discern which to accept and which to 
overcome."

Great mantra... It boils down to "I do whatever I think I should do".

> such as some
> of the Christian Scientists, that cancer and AIDS and SARS and many
> others are the result of immorality 

while other Christian Scientists recognize the need for disease to 
ensure a hardy species... once again... do we accept the disease and 
celebrate it for its benefits to humanity, or atone for our collective 
immorality and seek to overcome it by medicine and/or divine intervention?

> or God testing them, 

Again...perhaps God is simply using it as a vehicle to rescue them to 
the heavens... to resist it defies God. Clearly these "tests" can go 
either way... its a risky and arbitrary proposition deciding whether to 
interpret an event as something to accept or something to overcome, 
wouldn't you say?

> and to use

Odd that they don't see that 'prayer and devotion for healing' is itself 
2nd guessing the 'will of God' that they hold in such high esteem.

While not judging others leads us to permit murderers and molestors to 
walk free among our children... surely God wants us to judge those 
people unsuitable to mix with us... or perhaps these are angels of 
death, used by God to rescue souls to the heavens... and by locking them 
up we interfere with Gods plan.

faith is a multi-edged sword. I refuse to accept an argument of faith 
because it is inherently a random arbitratration.

One interpretation is fundamentally no better than another because 
neither rests on any basis which can be evaluated or measured. They 
exist in a vaccuum of rational thought.

> It's all belief, so inconsistancies are accepted.

The beauty and appeal of faith is that you don't have to think. 
Inconsistences are not "accepted", they are never conceived of in 
thought in the first place.
