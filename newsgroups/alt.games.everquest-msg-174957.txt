Can't speak for others, but I'm on US servers only.

They have girlie servers?  Wow!  I can think of at least one regular
(not myself) who's gonna want in one that.

Not that I've ever heard of.

If you have PoP, go to the PoK book in North Qeynos.  It's just outside
the city wall.  Facing the city entrance from the outside, follow the
outside of the wall around to your right (or if exiting the city go
left) until you find a book on a pedestal, get close to it and click
on it.  That will gate you to PoK, the Nexus stone is north and a bit
west of the Qeynos stone, find it (it says "The Nexus" on it) and click
like you did on the book.  That gates you to the Nexus, the bazaar is
adjacent to the Nexus, zone is off the southern "arm".

Without PoP you would have to go to the giant spires in Toxx Forest or
North Karana, hail the Nexus Scion and follow the quest text (or just
target the Scion and say "I journey to Luclin") to get a shard, then
wait inside the spires until you are gated up to the Nexus.

This is often a good place to ask questions.  I'll let those who
(apparently) delight in such things post links to favorite websites.

While these last two are virtues, it can be entertaining at times
to join the Dance of Flames when a troll shows up.  Cross-posting
is (usually) just spam by another name tho.  As for your conclusion,
your logic is a bit weak.  How could we possibly know at this point
that your self-proclaimed virtues aren't concealing a monster?  :-p
