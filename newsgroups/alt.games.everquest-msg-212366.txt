Ergo God is not omnipotent and omniscient. :)

As you said omnipotence and omniscience precludes free will. Seeing as 
living in a world without free will means my life is totally without 
meaning I'm going to take it on 'faith' that this isn't the case. I 
choose to beleive there is a point to being alive.

Additionally numerous times in the Bible God was "displeased". If 
something displeased him, and he was omnipotent and omniscient then he 
would have both known it was going to happen and must take responsbility 
for having set it in motion in the first place. How can you be 
displeased with the results of something that performs exactly how you 
made it, and how you knew it would? Why would an omnipotent being create 
something he knew wasn't going to work right?

No I think attributing omnipotence and omniscience to God is fallacious. 
It leads to numerous inconsistencies and absurdities...
