Gamer's Edge is proud to announce RPG night at GE.  Every Wednesday,
Gamer's Edge will be running a special, come down and play your
favorite MMORPG for $10 for the time block of 7pm-10pm.  Nothing
better than playing Everquest with your group sitting right next to
you instead of across town.  Along with the latest patches and
expansions, Gamer's Edge also has top of the line computers with a T1
connection to make that zoning go faster.  During Wednesday, RPGer's
will also get 10% off any literature material they need to run their
campaign.
