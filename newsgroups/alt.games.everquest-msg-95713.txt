Plenty.  For the most part, it's not the wattage but the amperage and the
stability that count.  When you pick your CPU, go to Intel or AMD's
approved list and find a power supply listed there.  That's your safest
bet.

> Case:		Mid-tower (Are they all the same?) 

As was said before, there are differences in terms of accessibility,
quality, and cooling.  I like Antec cases myself, for classic steel ones.
Lian Li cases get good press on the aluminum side.  These are lighter and
(arguably) cooler, but more expensive.

Many cases also come with a power supply, which may be a consideration 
for you.  Antec's default power supply for their minitower is a little 
anemic for a high-powered Athlon or P4.  Many shops will swap out the
power supply for something better for a small premium.  Make sure
you ask about this if the included supply isn't up to your preferred
specs.

Don't be.  That won't happen with any sort of heatsink on the card.  As
has been said, most new motherboards have some sort of thermal protection
system.  However, even if they don't, a simple heatsink will keep the
thing from flaming up.  With a heatsink and a fan, you'll be fine.

For motherboards, I like the KT266A chipset ones on the AMD side.  My
friend just bought an Asus A7V266-E and is pretty happy with it.  Abit
has a decent offering in the KR7A-RAID, too.  If you want bleeding edge, 
the KT333 chipset is out now.  However, it's arguable whether there are
any real performance improvements with it to speak of.  Dunno P4
motherboards well enough to comment, aside from saying that Abit, Asus,
Tyan, and MSI all make decent boards generally speaking.

> Memory:		768M-1G, but what kind?

DDR, for any new system.  Whether or not to spring for ECC or registered
depends on your motherboard.  Many motherboards won't use either feature
effectively, but some will.  If they do, it might be worth the money for
the extra stability (at a slight speed cost).

> Video:		GeForce4 4400/4600 as available 

Fine choice, both.  Again, for the extra cash I'd probably go for the
4600, unless you're strapped.  It'll last you that much longer.

> Disk Drive:	80Gig or so fast IDE, SCSI not worth the cost for me 

Go for wherever the price break is.  If that's 80G, great.  If it's more
or less, though, go for that.  The practical difference between 60G and
100G is next to nil; you'll never fill either, unless you collect lots of
media.

> DVD:		Whatever is new and fairly cheap

You might consider going a few extra bucks for a combo DVD/CDRW drive.
CD writers can be handy at odd times, and the premium's pretty low.

> Sound:		No idea here, good luck with Turtle Beach in the past

The Turtle Beach Santa Cruz is a fine card, with many less compatibility
issues than the current Creative batch, especially if you go with a
motherboard with a VIA chipset.

> Display:	Either existing 19", maybe a new 21", or a 17" LCD? 

I'd go for a 21" if you're buying a new one, or stick with your existing.
 17" LCDs only work well at their default resolution, and still tend to
have some ghosting issues due to slow refresh.

Mostly they add warranties and support.  If you can do your own, build
your own.  It'll be a lot cheaper.  However, if you're not so good with
figuring out incompatibilities between disparate components, etc., you
may want to consider an Alienware or Falcon Northwest system.  They're
expensive, but they're fast and they work well.  Most of these companies
will shuffle options around for you, as far as things like joysticks and
the like go, so long as they have little effect on them being able to
guarantee compatibility.

Good luck with the new box!
