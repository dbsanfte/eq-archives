Well i certainly could and did imagine it :p The dot corpse poof bug was
caused when the dot did the mob in and had fallen of the memory stack thus
causing nothing attributable to kill the mob . They have since fiddled with
the programming to alleviate that bug and others. I am not sure how they did
this programming but I have definite guesses :p and it still behaves as a
memory stack though the problems are significantly less egregious than they
once where.

You asked for proof . I am certainly not going to go out of my way to
provide you with it . I would suggest that you only believe those things
that are consistent with something you already know to be true or check it
out for yourself :p
