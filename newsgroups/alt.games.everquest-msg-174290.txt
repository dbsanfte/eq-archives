Hey, I have to ask a question about this. I'm planning on restarting
my EQ career after a couple of years absence. Could you save me a
couple of keystrokes (yes I'm lazy, heh) and briefly tell me what sort
of system requirements are now needed? I was able to run EQ about 3
years ago on a Celeron processor running at 467 Mhz and 96 MB RAM
(with Kunark and Velious). What are the recommended requirements
nowadays?

Thanks.
