Keep in mind several things, Judy...

The actual percentages of police officers who are like the one on the
video are small when compared to how many peace officers are in this
country.  As evidenced by that same video where one office restrained
the other from hitting the little punk even more.

Also, one can never truly understand a cop's attitude unless they have
walked a beat or patrolled a sector...
