Eh?  I remember both LS and the Bazaar showed up with proper maps
after their respective revamps.  (Might've only been after a full
file check, but of course that was required to get the bazaar to
work at all.)

The lines of the old maps WERE still overlaid for me also, but that's
because I'd downloaded non-SOE maps of those zones long ago, and the
downloaded maps went into <zonename>_1.txt.  Sony's not responsible
for what's in those files.  I turned off "layer 1" in the "visible
layers" part of the map window, and the lines went away.  I got rid
of my xxx_1.txt files for those zones, and the lines went away for
good.

I do agree they should've included an updated map in this patch when
they closed off the hallways, since now the map IS an official file.
