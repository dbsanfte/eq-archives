If you're soloing as a ranger you'd best be fighting things that won't
be hitting back anyways, ie fearkiting. Trying to use a bow as a
method of damage dealing is... well its *possible*, but its so slow I
can't imagine ever doing it, and I say that as someone who has done
some pretty miserable solo grinding in my time.

Yes.

Btw when using archery I can crit for 2349 using TS, so that's what
you have to look forward to. But no ranger should be using archery as
their form of dps until they have AM2 at least.
