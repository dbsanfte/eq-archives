I have had similar problems, and the only solution I seem to be able to come
up with is to carry double (or more) the amount of pp needed to buy the item
in questions.

For example

Trader_Bob_0 is selling  a "cloth cap of yummyness" of 10pp, with 11pp in my
purse I seem unable to buy the item, after a quick run to the bank I now
have 21pp on my person and now find I am able to buy the cap.

It seems to work for me everytime, but its not so easy when your buying 4k
plus items =/
