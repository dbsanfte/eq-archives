Don't worry - all the data about his characters is stored on the
Everquest host servers, NOT on his PC's hard drive - his characters
will be safe and sound, XP-wise and equipment-wise, exactly as he left
them.

When the drive was partitioned, was the Everquest folder put back into
the same location on the hard drive as it was originally?  If it was
originally in C:\Program Files\Sony\Everquest, for example, it has to
go back there, not on another partition or location. 

Other than that, I would think running the patcher would fix the
problem you mentioned.
