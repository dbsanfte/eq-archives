Of course, a lot of things are frowned on by the user EULA for EQ that
get done anyway, like sharing accounts (etc.) 

I know that some guilds will buy accounts for the sake of getting
needed personnel. Less putatively, I know that among my friends,
people have passed on accounts to friends rather than see the
character die and the groups lose their resources. The trick to it is:

1.  Don't take over a char of a significantly higher level than you've
played on your own. 

2.  Don't get involved in pickup groups until you've LEARNED to play
the character. Group with people who KNOW you took over the character,
preferrably ones who have played the class you're taking over.

3.  Don't take a prime raid role (MA, COTH mage, Lead Cleric, etc)
until you've played the character through one entire post-50 level.
