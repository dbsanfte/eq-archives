Hi Guys,
   I recently upgraded,let me tell you from what to what. I had an AMD 300,
16mb Matrox millinium video, Sound Blaster 16, 312mg RAM And 40gig HD. I
bought a P4 1.5, 64mb Gforce3, SBLive sound(with subwoofer), 60gig HD, 512mb
RAM. I have cable, so speeds are good.
    The most criticle stats for you to look at are the Video card and
motherboard transfer rates. A 64mb video card is helpful, but if an old
motherboard can only transfer that at 33mhtz, it does little good. The
transfer rate for the HD is also important. If you upgrade the processor
without a new motherboard, all that processor speed can be hung up in a slow
motherboard. This applies to most components on your computer. Upgrading one
component will not nessesarily upgrade performance.
  My sugesstion is to look at the complete systems available. Not at the top
of the line P4 2.0 gig processors, but the 1.5 to 1.7 range. The performance
difference between a 1.5 and 2.0 will be indistinguishable in 99% of what
you do. In upgrading to a new machine though, you get the faster transfer
rates that WILL make a difference. Get the best video card you can, sound is
not expensive, and most bundled machines come with SBLive or equivilent. My
only regret in my new machine is I opted to not get the new Rambus Ram, but
it is MUCH faster. Again, it is the transfer rate that makes the difference.
1/2 the amount of rambus ram performes like twice the amount of sdram,
because it moves the data 4 times as fast.
   Personnaly I went to a local shop and had a computer made, wich was
cheaper than the mass marketers, and I get better service. When Dell sell's
you a service contract, they usually forget to tell you that the major
components, processor, motherboard, HD, floppy, CD, all come with 3-year
manufacture warenties. The local shops usually include labor to go with the
manufactures warrenty.
  Thats my 2 cents worth......Good Luck!
