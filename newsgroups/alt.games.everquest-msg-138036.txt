Lol, I was thinking just about exactly the same thing.  Gee, with just a few
amazing uber drops, off of mobs that I don't expect to ever even see, I
could get to soloing effectively at high level with a warrior.  Fungi is
pretty accessible, we've had a few drop for us.  The rest of that, well, I
guess I could see where it drops, I know Primal is not an option.

Richard <-- Thinks that there just might be a case of uberitis going on
