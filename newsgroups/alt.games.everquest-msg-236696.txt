Ah. Ok, the pdf version of the printed version if you have the box.
(which was cheaper in my case... i certainly didn't get it for the
little metal stick thing :).

I knew that the leadership abilities were only available according to
who the current group leader was... but what that means when soloing
is a bit ambiguous. A group of one :) ... I'm guessing it doesn't
apply, and I never expected it to.

A group of 2? Harder to say. SOE seems to define groups arbitrarily as
it pleases them. For LDoN, the 'group' oriented expansion, the group
minimum to actually even get into the game was 4 (later lowered to 3).
I guess groups of 3 (and now 2) don't aren'tt valid groups, although I
and at least some others do.. :)

Same with leadership xp, you need 3 to earn it. Do you also need 3 for
group abilities to be active? Or is 2 sufficient? I'd should think
*any* group, even 2 would benefit from the leadership skills... but
SOE may think otherwise. I was hoping someone who had actually seen
leadership skills in action would comment...

I would also like to know what in the manual led you to beleive
leadership xp was reduced on death?
