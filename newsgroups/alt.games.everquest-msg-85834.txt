Try this:

Get at least one of the item you want.   Find an item on the
vendor that is non-stackable.   Buy the item to clear a space
on the vendor and -- without clicking done -- sell him the item
you want.  Click 'Done.'

Select the vendor again.  If your item is there, he doesn't have
any other ones.  If it's not, he does.  Then you can select items
(generally non-stackable "rare" items or "rare" stackable ones)
and buy them, closing out the window after you create an empty
slot.   At some point, you'll find the item you want.   *ONLY* sell
items back after you've created an empty slot by buying them
(otherwise you'll just keep buying them over and over) AND when
the vendor doesn't have an empty slot.  Since they're "new" to the
vendor (he doesn't have any more or the slot wouldn't be empty),
they go at the end of the list.  The silks are higher on his list of things
to sell and you'll see them before you see that item again.

Short version:
1) have an item you want;
2) open vendor, buy all of one slot until it's empty, sell that item;
3) re-open vendor;
4a) if your item shows, he doesn't have more.  Buy your item back
    and go try another vendor;
4b) if your item doesn't show, buy all of one slot until it's empty,
    close vendor, see if your item is showing.  If so, sell all the
    "crap" back and buy all the items the vendor has.  If not,
    sell all the "crap" back, close vendor, and go back to step 3.

Eventually you'll either run out of money from buying "crap" (it
happens) or not have enough money to buy what he has in
inventory (that happens too) or your item will show.

The other way, especially in places like EK, is to go there right
after a patch before a lot is sold.  Sell him a silk which should
show immediately in inventory.  Then you can check back in a
few hours and buy all he has.  Sometimes you'll lose the one you
sold because someone else is mining the vendors, but it's a
fairly easy way of "seeding" the vendor so you don't have to buy all
the crap to find what you want.

That's not that good for silks (since they are relatively popular)
but it's a pretty good way to get pelts used for leather padding
since the pelts aren't quite as high in demand.
