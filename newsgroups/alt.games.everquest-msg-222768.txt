You don't need the stone, although we all thought you did when it
first came out.  

Find a group of people all within 7 levels of each other, at
least 3 (if the patch works, used to be at least 4) members.  

Go to a Wayfarer camp (found in NRo, SRo, EC, Butcherblock, and
Everfrost)

Leader approaches adventure guy (forget the name, but its not
Raid Recruiter or Adventure Merchant) and asks for an adventure. 
One is offered, which he can accept or reject, if he rejects it
he can get another offer after a few seconds, and repeat until he
gets one he likes.  Once he accepts one, everyone in the group
gets a pop up box explaining it and you have 30 minutes to start
the mission.

Part of the explaination will be what sort of mission it is:

Collect: kill mobs and loot them, some will have a specific item
you need, you have to get a specified number of them.  Some say
this is bugged and there may not be enough of the item in the
whole zone even if you kill every mob, but I've never seen that
happen.

Slaughter: Kill a certain number of mobs.  Simple, direct, easy
to keep track of how well you are doing, this seems to be most
people's favorite

Assasination: Kill a specific mob that pops in the zone after you
kill a number of the lesser mobs.  You'll get a special message
when your target pops, and you'll also get messages periodically
telling you which direction he's in (behind and left, so on).  To
make use of the latter you need to not be turning around, so when
one comes you can figure out which compass heading he's on.  LOY
map of the zone will also be of enourmous aid here.

Rescue: Same as assasination, more or less, but you have to get
to the target, then walk back to the entrance with him.

Some people like assasination, if their group is low DPS but has
stealth skills, once they trigger the mob they can sneak up to it
and kill it in place, thereby avoiding having to kill huge
numbers in the time given.  It seems Rescue doesn't have that
advantage, since you still have to clear the path out, the rescue
victim won't sneak out with you.

You'll also get a zone to go to, and when you reach that zone a
blue line will appear on your compass showing you which direction
the zone line to your adventure is in.

Normal plan is to go there and then do final buffs, med up to
full, then zone in, making use of as much of the 30 minutes as
you need.  Once even one person zones in, the 30 minutes is over
and you get a new timer, usually 90 minutes, in which to complete
the mission.  If you fail to complete in that time, you get an
extra 30 minutes for partial success.  If you do succede then the
90 minute timer goes away and you have 30 minutes to stay and
kill more stuff if you like, or make your way out.  When the 30
minute timer is up, you'll be dumped unceremoniously out where
you zoned in.  A few minutes after that, any bodies you left
inside will pop in the same place (there will probably be a pile
of bodies there)

A slightly better plan is for everyone but the leader to head
right for the target spot, which is reasonably predictable, so
you can buff up while he's headed over, this can save a minute or
two for the A type personalities out there.  But since 30 minutes
is far more time than you'll ever need to walk two or three zones
away and buff and med, its hardly necessary, and its handy to
stay put till the mission is selected in case you go LD: you MUST
be in the group when the mission is selected, they can't add you
in afterwards.

Lets see, what else.  Oh, inside you'll see some crates which can
be opened and might have something moderately beneficial (group
goes to full mana, you get a pet) or something moderately
detrimental (several small mobs appear and attack).  You'll also
see chests, these never have anything you'll need to finish the
mission, and are often very deadly to open, so everyone leaves
them alone till the mission is over, and only considers opening
them during the 30 minute extra time.  Noting their locations is
clever... but be careful not to target them or inspect them or
anything, the traps are very sensitive.

That stone they told you about is an Augment which you put on a
charm, and you get a little boost from it once you've completed a
lot of LDoN missions, apparantly.  I personally have yet to see
any boost at all... it does have a reccomended level of 65 on it,
so perhaps at 43 I'm just too low for it to help, or then again,
perhaps I just haven't done enough missions for it to matter
yet.  Either way, its nothing you need to rush to get, you
apparantly need dozens of successes before it gives any benefit
at all.
