Paladins have an invunerability spell, similar to cleric DA/DB.  For a
number of hard-hitting, low HP mobs with big AEs, the preferred method
is to have a Paladin pull him with invunerable up.  Pally rushes in,
hits invun, pulls the mob to the pre-determined spot, everyone else
jumps him.  The nice thing about this is that the first AE only hits
the invun pally, and there is a recycle time on the AE.  If done
correctly the AE will hit the invun pally twice, then everyone else
jumps in and blasts the bugger.

True, though it's tough to get a group as a wizard.  They just don't
offer enough to a mid-level group to justify taking up an additional
melee spot, at least that's the general feeling.  I love having
wizards in my exp groups, but I admit I'll take an unknown rogue over
an unknown wizard, just because a rogue kills himself, a wizard kills
everyone.
