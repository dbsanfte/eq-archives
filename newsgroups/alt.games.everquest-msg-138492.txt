While Great Divide is a very scary place for a twelve year old, I'd say
given a port to get there, that the Dreadlands port is the safest place
of all to wait for nexus.  Of course at 12 the Tox and GFay ones
are also quite safe, but if there's a chance of hitchhiking on someone's
port, DL wouldn't be a bad option at all.
