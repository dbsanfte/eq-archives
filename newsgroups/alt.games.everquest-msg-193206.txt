lol.  Beat that horse a few more times Ed, it might not be dead yet.
Not to mention that Planes of Profit is already implied by the L65
requirement.  I'm waiting for the expansion that's tied to specific
new servers which require a movelog (for a fee).  They seem to have
slightly missed the target with Stormhammer, but with all the market
research they've done since then I'm sure they can come up with a
better hook than "premium service".  The really amazing thing, to me,
is that they've managed to successfully emulate the Microsoft model
of having their customers pay them to do the market research they
need to do in order to suck as much money as possible out of those
very same customers.
