I had a similar story to yours, played EQ for 5-6 years and then moved
to WoW.  I've occasionally gone back into EQ when they've had freebie
trials for former players, but I really haven't done much, just signed
on and poked around.  

The problem I had was that you really need groups at the higher
levels.  When I left, I had a couple of good friends in EQ, but some
of them are gone, some of them have moved on to much harder content
that my character can't do, and at least one of them got pissed that I
left and isn't talking to me anymore (which I thought was kinda
childish, but that's another thread).  So getting back into the game
would involve a lot of work and pickup groups that just didn't sound
like fun.

The other problem I had was that WoW does have some fixes for
annoyances in EQ (like having to med forever to get mana back).  Stuff
that didn't annoy me when I played EQ, but going back I found them
difficult to deal with.

Ultimately I just decided that I had a limited amount of time to play
and that I had already played EQ to the extent that I wanted to and
that going back just didn't feel like a good use of time.  You might
poke around and see if they have some sort of freebie / discounted
package for former players so you could give it a shot and see what
your reaction is.
