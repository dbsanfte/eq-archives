I'd be very surprised if level 70 isn't by far the strongest selling
point for this expansion.  It will make a lot more difference than
either of those, even the extra spell slot, at least to all the people
who are already at level 65 (and there are a lot of those).  And with
the spell slot likely being an AA, low level people won't see it
anyway.  And buff slots are really only an issue to raiders, who will
want level 70 even more (since that should make most targets a good
deal easier).
