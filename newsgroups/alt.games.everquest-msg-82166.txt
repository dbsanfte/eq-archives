OMG, that's so bad that it's almost funny. (the IGIVEHEAD part, I mean)

I tried a SK for about 20 minutes. Of course, I got <totally> lost in Grobb
and nearly drowned in the stupid swamp, so that might have been part of the
problem (yeah, like about 90%)... but I didn't like the class for some
reason that (oh gee, what a surprise!) I can't remember now. But I did read
a lot of stuff online that seemed to suggest that they were <really> hard to
play at later levels. I also didn't much like that 'I get no spells until
lvl (what is it, 9?)' thing. Of course, I also hated being a warrior as
well, so I should prolly not be handing out advice.

Oh gee, I just remembered, I'm not giving advice, I'm just running my mouth!
