Ranger:

Primary role: Melee damage, buffing.

Secondary roles: Pulling, kiting, debuffing

Tertiary roles: Crowd control, tanking, patch healing, ranged damage.

With today's gear, a ranger can tank very well up to level 55, without AA
you will lose your tanking ability (being able to soak up damage, avoid
hits) after around tier 1 PoP (ie, Plane of Justice).  After this level, a
ranger can typically tank the last expansion fairly well, if using gear from
the most recent expansion, though this is mob / group dependant of course,
they were never meant to be true tanks.

Melee dps (damage per second), is and always has been a rangers primary form
of DPS, if you ignore the blip which was PoP crafted bows.

They receive the best attack buffs in the game, the Strength of Tunare and
Strength of the Hunter lines, which most melee DPS classes will ask for,
before they recieve these group spells, they have single target attack
buffs, but at lower levels, these are generally only worth keeping up on
yourself, if at all. Guard of the Earth is an AC / DS buff, which most tank
classes will request.r

Rangers have great tools for pulling in outdoor zones, including Harmony (up
to level 40), Harmony of Nature (up to level 65), and Tranquility of the
Glade (up to level 70).  They also have the best tracking in the game, with
the ability to sort mobs by level, distance, spawn order, etc.  Also speed
buffs, SoW, SoE, Wolf Form.  Inate and Shared Camo are probably the most
useful AA buffs the ranger gets.

They also have (along with druids), the best, longest duration snares in the
game, giving them the ability to kite any snareable mob very efficiently, in
conjunction with their high aggro, low mana cost spells (flame lick,
tangling weeds), they make great bait in kite groups.  This kiting ability,
along with a variety of root spells, make them a reasonable crowd control
class.

They also receive debuffs in the form of dispell / annul spells,
unfortunatley these can remove player cast debuffs, though later on they
recieve the Natures balance line, which only removes buffs which are
beneficial to the NPC.

With the semi-recent updates to hybrid healing spells, rangers have the
ability to be average patch healers, with the correct AA, this ability is
greatly increased, allowing a ranger to occasionally save a group wipe.

Rangers, at later levels, also recieve some decent disciplines, the best of
which are Weapon shield (parry all hits for 20seconds), Warders Wrath
(increase Melee DPS output), and Trueshot (increase ranged weapon damage).

At level 59, the ranger gets access to the fabled archery AA, which
eventually increase your ranger damage output by 100%, and allow you to use
the most damaging arrow, without cost.  This is a tertiary skill, but can be
a very useful tool when AOE's are involved, or you are kiting NPC's.  The
rangers AA lines focus almost entirely on melee DPS.

Rangers are the best at few things, but can achieve almost any role of a
given class, just not as efficiently.
