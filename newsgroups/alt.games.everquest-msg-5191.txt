	Not that I go around inspecting people (cause I don't, unless
previously stated, it was an accident), but why is it in the game if
it's no one's business?  I mean, if they can make it in Diablo II
where no one can see what you have, then I'm sure Verant could have
done it w/ Everquest.  I just don't find it rude.  Annoying sometimes
maybe, but not rude.
