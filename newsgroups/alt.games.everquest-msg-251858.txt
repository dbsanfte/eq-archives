Group DS is useful for the resists only, sure you could make it so it was
efficient, but nothing that is  really worth the bother.

/pet kill may help here, never had a chance to really test this command (my
mage is only 39).

Hmm I think your earth pet is pretty gimpy at the moment (upgrade at 65?),
or you could try rooting one (usually pet procs root before attacking), then
taking the other, fiddly but maybe possible.

Try targetting pet when raining for less aggro.

According to graffes, all rains have an inbuilt 22% (around that number)
chance to resist, irrespective of debuffs etc.
