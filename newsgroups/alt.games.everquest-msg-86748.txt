My Direct X video drivers are already 8.1.  I have also downloaded and
installed the latest updated drivers for my video card.  I have also typed
"UseUmbra=FALSE" in my eqclient.ini file.

While all these things made the game much more playable than it was when
Luclin was first released, I still have the nudity bug.
What seems to work for some does not work for others.

I have tried reducing the number of Luclin models to well below the maximum
recommended for my memory.  I've turned off the Luclin emote graphics.  I've
lowered the texture quality from medium to low.  None of that worked for me,
either.

For some of us, the only fix will most likely be to upgrade to a whole new
video card.  In the current economy, for some of us, that may be a while.
