My main rogue learned to swim back in the day when everybody  hung out in
S. Karana to level through a certain few.  Swimming back and forth from
the Arena (nearest bind point for melee) through Lake Rathe got his swimming
up to post 100 easy.  All of 'em after that were just flukes that just
happened
by accident while having fun ( he went 140-200 on a Kedge Keep run later
on in life :-)  ).

My alt rogue had an easier time.  She donned a Fishbone Earring, and walked
out of the bank to the "sewers" in N. Freeport, where she simply jumped in
the
water and swam into a corner while I turned on the other computer and did
homework for about 5 hours.  Her skill hit 200 with no trouble :-).
