I can't think why.. I doubt anyone would purchase a game by a company
that could not keep a server up.   Afterall, the other systems would
be more complex and would then be prone to more problems.

Speaking from the Perspetive of an IT professional.  Im guessing that
someone over there released code proir to going to their convention.
The code started to interact badly, and they have been trying to
support it remotely.  I dont doubt that in the next few days it will
be resolved.

Speaking as a customer.. I sure as HECK hope someone is getting layed
over a table and cut open for their mistakes.
