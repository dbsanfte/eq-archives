    No. Easy key quest = pure time sink. I don't like knowing that the
designers wanted me to waste a little bit of my time to get into a zone. If
a zone has content truly worth keying, the key quest should be hard.

    For the end-game zone of an expansion, yes. It rewards whatever guild
puts in the most time and effort to get there. For lesser zones, no - it's
just another timesink in lieu of actual encounter difficulty.

    No. That model has failed, as far as I'm concerned. Flagging folks just
for access to XP zones? What a waste.

    Yes, if the content the flag leads to can be blown. For example, as
things stand now I am in favour of a raid flag being required for HoH
access. The trials in HoH can be triggered by simply saying "I am ready" to
an NPC, and once triggered don't re-pop for three days. That needs to be
guarded against the morons of the EQ world. Compare that with, say, Torment,
where nothing can be blown or botched without raid-level effort. Having a
few other places for non-power guild people to XP would have helped a lot.

    Should be the norm, unless you can justify one of the above. Honestly, I
thought Luclin had the right model for access - if you up a few drop
percentages, and enable CotH in a few zones.
