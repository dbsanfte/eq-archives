1) Cox and Comcast *barely* pay attention when hundreds of customers have 
serious access problems for their $40+/month.  I think your "complaint" 
will be a bit further down that ladder.

2) If your newbie buttocks don't like the model that the Internet at large
uses, and therefore "real" ISPs (yes, even Cox?), then feel free to join
AOL or some kind of filtered government/religious ISP instead.  I don't
want you (or anyone else) telling me what I can or can not access on the
public Internet, whether I agree with it or not.  If it's there, it's
there; the end.  I don't need or want some whiny NetCop with nothing else
to do buggering it up.  If you have a problem grasping this concept please
flee to some closed-gate ISP that makes all the "bad stuff" go away for
you.
