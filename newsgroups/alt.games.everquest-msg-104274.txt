I realize that a lot of these people are "coming of age" for the market.
It's just quite an odd departure from what we've seen in the past.  I
absolutely LOVE Led Zeppelin, and I just find it being used in an
advertisement rather boggling.  Jimmy Page was so serious about his music.
I wonder if you could have told him back in 1968 that his music would be
selling Cadillacs 30 years later what his reaction would have been...
