Has anyone ever retrieved Bard faction from being KoS? How long did it take,
approx?
I have spent about 4 hrs hacking my way through Castle Mistmoore but I am
still no better off...as far as I know there is no other way of regaining
Bard faction when you are KoS, am I wrong?
It's annoying not being able to go to a gig on Norrath without the band
attacking you :ï¿½/

Does Mayong Mistmoore actually spawn now? I seem to remember he/she/it was
removed from the game for being "unbalanced"
