You get punted out to just outside the zone-in.

Dead bodies end up in the same place. The usual directions to the
zone-ins once we got into the zone they were in was "look for the big
pile of corpses". ;) /hidecorpse is your friend...

I'm pretty sure the corpses are rezzable within the normal time
limits, even after they've been dumped out of the dungeon.

If you still have time on the mission, you log back in in the dungeon.
You can rejoin the group just fine from there. If it's run out, you're
just outside.

You can be rezzed back just fine in LDoN. I've also been led to
believe that the dungeons actually exist constantly (Basically, they
have multiple copies of the same zone always on), you just can't get
into the specific instances until you're flagged (which also decides
which instance you go into), and it's not populated until someone is
assigned a mission. Of course, that's an educated guess, I don't have
any actual inside knowledge to confirm that.
