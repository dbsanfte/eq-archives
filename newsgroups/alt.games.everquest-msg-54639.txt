    No - that's part of the point. There's a nice screenshot of a post-Kael
raid by the overseas guild on Veeshan - bodies as far as the eye can see.
They bind-point rush it. All that it takes to kill ubermob X is enough
players of level Y with "good enough" equipment, and over time everyone ends
up at that level. Go to FoH's web site and read their strategy for taking
down the fourth Warder, and see if your guild could manage it (requires more
than a few DB wizards, one very-well equipped tank, and a bunch of folks
with bows and arrows).

    Normally, I'd chortle along with you. But this would be something neat -
the first kill of the Avatar of War without the pet-hate bug. I don't care
that they can't farm drops off mob X for the umpteenth time, but to be
denied a server-wide first (or second, depending on how you look at it)
because of time zones does make me feel some empathy for them. And hey - who
said that they could win? 8)
