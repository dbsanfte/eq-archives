I usually just type an emote basically saying "Soandso gets better at
ignoring
Beggers (45)"


Mine is a shout...
/shout %t fails in their begging attempt.
/shout %t should attempt to find more productive work.
/shout %t s parents are very disappointed.

That usually shuts them up (for 5 minutes or so).  Of course, I also add
them to my /ignore.
