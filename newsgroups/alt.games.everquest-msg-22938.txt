A friend of mine just got the game and we've been playing an Ogre
Shammy/Warrior combo.  They're level 7 now and its been easy going so far.
I figure with the Warriors massive hp's, and Shammy to
sow/dot/debuff/buff/heal this should be a pretty fun combo.  I've also got a
31 Cleric and a 16 Chanter, so I'm not worried about getting into
groups/guilds with the Ogres really, more like just wondering how long this
will be a viable duo w/out having add group members?
