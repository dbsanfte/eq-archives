Every caster I have played up to specialization levels would have had
Alteration win if no pains were taken to ensure otherwise. For the
cleric, shaman, druid, and necro, Alteration is a decent if not 
best choice, but for my magician I stopped and altered nature's 
course. For the magician, Alteration was winning due to pet heals,
though Evoc and Conj were only lagging a couple of points behind.

Since I have spent most of my EQ career playing healer classes, 
playing pet healer just felt natural. Old habits are hard to break.
