Unless you specifically want thurg quest armor, I'd advise going to
ToV Halls of Testing instead.  The entrance ledge area seems to
be plate drop heaven, and is the usual camp for sub 60s anyway,
drop rate per mob is ten times that of Kael drop rates.  If your
raid force is capable of keeping up a decent kill rate you'll see
a dozen drops a night, most of them plate, while seeing a couple
drops a night in Kael and the odds of them being plate no better
than one in four.  There -are- other drops in Kael that make
the place worth going to (Silvery Belt of Contention my personal
favorite random mob drop) and of course the place is good
practice and good for faction work... but if you really want a
full set of Velious quest plate, I'd skip right over Kael and head
for HOT
