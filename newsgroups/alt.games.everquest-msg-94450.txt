Zerg comes from zergling rush.  Some other game had a race of characters 
called the zerglings.  They were dumb, but bred rapidly, so a strategy was 
to just make as many zerglings as you could and then overpower the 
technically superior but undermanned forces.  
In Everquest it is basically used to refer to the strategy of throwing an 
overwhelming number of characters at certain boss mobs.  Most servers have 
a guild which does the high-end mobs, but uses overwhelming force rather 
than skill or strategy.  This guild is generally referred to as a Zergling 
guild.

Arolpin
not a zergling
