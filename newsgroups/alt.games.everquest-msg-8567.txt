im only gonna do it to peeps who sell words for 40 plat where otheres give
them away for free.
words make spells and are pretty essential.

com'on calm down. i've never deliberately trained someone in my life and
probably never will.

wot do you have to say about the norrathian 2nd hand car dealers? buying
high and selling low for luxuries is ok (i dont do it) but ripping peeps off
for a necessity they are desperate for is low imo.
