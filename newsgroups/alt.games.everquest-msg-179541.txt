I'd love to see some numbers from an authoritative source supporting
that statement.  And it doesn't actually contradict the previous
poster's statement.  But both are not really relevant, pricing is
determined by the market (i.e. SOE raised EQ's price <after> DAoC
demonstrated that people would pay that much), not by desired margin.
Profitablity does have a rather huge impact on decisions about future
development and suchlike.
