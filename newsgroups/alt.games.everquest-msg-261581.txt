The way I look at it, if Mal-x wasn't resisted, slow wouldn't have
been either. They both have the same MR check.

But the tradeoff is that you'll get over half of those mobs slowed in
about 5 seconds if you lead with slow. Probably more a matter of style
and the difficulty of the mobs you're fighting. I just don't consider
LDoN mobs tough enough to worry about whether you even slow every one
or not. At 65, if my first slow bounces I won't bother to try and
reslow on a single pull. My goal isn't to slow every mob no matter the
mana cost, I just want to reduce the damage enough over a 10 or 15
minute period that the healer doesn't have mana difficulties. 

... but a lot of this is situational.
