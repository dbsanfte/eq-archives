There are encounters, anywhere from one group to full raid for many of 
the flags.  For example, to get the PoV/PoS flag, you went to PoJ, and 
with one group, completed any one of several trials.  The trials in that 
case involved usually multiple waves of multiple mobs that had to be 
killed, followed by a boss mob at the end.  Most if not all of those 
trials were timed, you had to kill everything within a set time, or you 
failed.

For other flags, they can be complete by a full on raid taking down some 
major mob, or, some have a quest means of completing them, basically 
collecting up the right items and turning them in to the quest NPC.

You recieve the flag when you complete the encounter/quest, and the game 
tells you that you have recieved a character flag.

They are detailed in a variety of places on the web, including 
everquest.allakhazam.com among other places.
