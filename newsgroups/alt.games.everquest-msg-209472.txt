I'll agree that there is some (not much, but some) mid-level gear
that isn't too outrageously priced by vendors.  But, consider the
lowbie melee's biggest problem:  weapons.  Lowbie weapons are
priced absurdly by NPC vendors, they pay only a few pp for them
and charge 10 to 30 times as much.  So you can buy the same
weapon from a PC for under 10pp that a vendor will charge over
50pp for.  You can get weapons good enough to kill wisps with
very cheaply from other players, killing wisps can easily net you
300pp by the time you're level 15 (assuming you do the Concordance
quest) and 300pp can upgrade a melee quite nicely at L15, but only
if you buy from other players, you can't get squat from NPC's.  And
with today's newbie quests you could be in quite decent shape at
that point, with most of your newbie kit, banded or better to fill
the other slots, a pair of Golden Fire Wedding Rings and one half
decent weapon in addition to your newbie weapon and as many cheapo
weapons as you need to be able to practice other skills.  Not only
that, but while it's not your usual "high fantasy" RP, there're
many characters from a wide variety of movies, stories, and serials
in which characters were focused (or even obsessed) with achieving
their peak potential (seems to be a very common theme in oriental
legend and fantasy), which you can pursue as RP without actually
becoming a mechanical minmaxer.  A simple easy way to be distinct
from the minmaxer is to reject most minor upgrades as inconsequential
while pursuing even tiny advantages in the area of your character's
"obsession".  Find a half-dozen other little quirks you'd like to
make part of your personality and you're halfway to becoming a
memorable character (don't announce your quirks, just play them, and
don't overplay them either, make them real by just being that way,
RP isn't about thee and thou, it's about assuming a role).
