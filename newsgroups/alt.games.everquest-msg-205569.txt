 Any advice from a faithful defender of Tunare, especially an Elven or
Human Ranger would be greatly appreciated. And I'm not looking for a
mommy or a sugardaddy.

You need to be level 17 before you can train the Dual Wield skill. 
Just put 1 training point into it when you ding and it will go up on
its own after that.  Tzen dinged 17 in Highhold Pass, and went to the
ranger trainer in Kithicor (only go in during the day, and run along
the North wall until directly south of Morin, the trainer, run down,
train it, then back *exactly* the way you came).  Of course that was
pre-Luclin so perhaps you won't be spending your teens in HHP / HHK.

My first off-hand weapon was a 1hb (I can't remember the name and I
can't look up allakhazam in work) but it proc'd Yaulp (Screaming
Mace??)).  A big, slow hitter is best in your off hand, as at the
start it won't swing very often, [and when it swings it will not hit
very often :)] so your best bet is some large damage weapon to
maximise damage when it eventually connects!.

Some other advice...don't neglect your 2hs / 2hb either.  Tzen didn't
train them until into his 40's but you should try to work on them
earlier if you can.  Depending on your role in a group you may not
want to draw aggro (if you are not the main tank), so a 2hs / 2hb
might be better.  Or if you are soloing, you will want to start your
attacking with your Swarmcaller (which proc's a type of slow), then
finish it off with your 2 1-handers.
