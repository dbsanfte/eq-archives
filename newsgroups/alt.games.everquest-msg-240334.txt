I don't really know you to jump on your balls, but I recall a post a few
days back a swear-filled post about warriors>palis and the like.

Reading your posts today, you don't seem like somebody ignorant to the world
of EQ.. but to argue so passionately about a topic (agro), when you are
wrong on one of the most fundamental issues at the heart of your argument...

It was a simple question really. I wanted to give you the chance to clarify
your statement (whether you already knew, or just learnt something new, I
don't really care), it makes you sound a bit silly to argue so much, without
really knowing the facts of your own argument.

Heres what you said, "normal taunt is still active but tends to fail a lot,
and when it succeeds it isn't THAT much agro."

That statement is just dead wrong. You seem to share the common
misconception about agro, that each successful taunt will add a set amount
of agro to your total. It just doesn't work like that.

As to your "you don't know how Usenet works" comment.. well just because I
asked a question, without giving you attitude and flames, don't be under any
illusions that I am new to here, or Usenet in general.

Don't try and fob me off by thinking im not aware of the level of the game
you play at either... because then you will look really silly :)

Now if you want me to respond in a similar tone to the attitude you extended
to me..

"... You had to let a pally or SK tank for you? I played a warrior both
before and after the melee changes at all levels and never once did I have
to have a gimp hybrid tank for me."

Just what exactly makes knights gimp to you?  I mean you probably aren't
aware, but paladins have tanked everything from Cazic Thule in PoTime to
Quarm.
I've had a paladin tank the tipt trial including flawless kill of the named
(who wasn't slowed until 10% hp either)... what role did i not cover, where
they could possibly be gimp?  I mean from high end raiding to 1 group
adventures.. what am i forgetting?

>> I did have situations where a gimp hybrid couldn't manage THEIR agro
though.

Unless the person is generally retarded, agro loss is usually attributed to
poor form on the part of a warrior, not poor agro control of a hybrid.  If
you can't keep agro locked from somebody trying to maximise their DPS (and
btw when a shadowknight snares, he is damage doting the mob also).. well,
you are failing in your duty as a warrior.

Now it could be that the paladin/SK were deliberately attempting to gain
agro.. I don't know, I mean.. dealing with idiots isnt an area of my
expertise. Maybe you could enlighten me though/

>> Shamans were never a problem except at high levels where they want to
become lazy fucks and not malo before slow and wonder why they pick the mob
out
>> of their teeth.

I don't really get this line.. are you saying a slow cast without malo will
generate more agro? Which is of course absurd..
Or the slow resists from not debuffing a mob?  Whilst the second has some
merit.. its still possible for a mob to resist slow when debuffed you know,
and in a lot of cases, pre-debuffs aren't even necessary to reliably land a
slow.  Malos also isnt a fast casting spell.. and like all spells has a 2
second refresh time...in some situations an early slow is almost vital to a
tanks chances of living, so there may not be time to malos when its in camp

>> Hah.. any group that needs a pally as an assistant tank isn't a good
group.
>> Keeping in mind i'm referencing them at their 65 levels....

Come back and tell me how your kod taz 1 group trials are going, with that
kindof attitude =)

>> and for SK/Pally.. the agro they have IS enough to just disregard Malo
and just slow. But warriors
>> aren't given the tools to agro that fast and overcome straight slow agro.

>> with the new AA, incite you get once every 30 seconds

Actually a landed slow isnt that bad agro, with a monk tank in plane of
earth, a slow at 95% won't draw agro from the monk (tested over the course
of an evening).. its the resisted slows, and stacking of dots (in particular
poison dots) where agro loss can come into play.

Umm.. a monk doesn't give a flying fuck if they get hit either, neither does
a Sk or Paladin... heck, i don't give a fuck if my shaman gets hit in an
easy ldon.
Easy ldon is just that, easy.  You seem to think warriors are like, immune
to damage in an easy mission wheras other classes get wasted.

A room of mobs in Ldon is easy without mezzes, without shields, without ae
taunt, and certainly without defensive.
If you want to make a case where warriors dominate hybrids.. try better than
a zone where a chain and leather class is also an optimal tanker.

Well, we have a tank chain of JUST paladins for a certain god in potime. Not
as a one off, but for EVERY single kill, in over 6 months of farming.  I
know a lot of other guilds use the same class tank too.. so there goes that
argument.

So let me put it to you in your own terms.  Do you know what the fuck you
are talking about?

Like i said at the top - I simply asked an innocent civil question in the
first place, thanks :)
