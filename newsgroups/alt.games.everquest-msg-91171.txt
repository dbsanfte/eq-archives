Well deuh, 30 second death touch, approximately lvl 90 mob and quads for,
what, 2k?
Even if all the 50+ on AB would come together they wouldn't last 10 minutes
in a zone with Kerafyrm.
Not to mention it hops zones so you need to start over if you don't do it
fast enough and it depops after going through all the zones so you only have
a very small timeframe to prepare and/or regroup.

I do know there has been some mentioning of a script-in-the-make to repop
the sleeper. But that's all at the very beginning on the drawing boards and
might not make it to the game at all.
