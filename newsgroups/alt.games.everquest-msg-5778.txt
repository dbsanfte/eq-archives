Where's the irony, I wonder?  In the fact that those who claim to kill file,
in actuality, don't?  In the fact that you goombahs take this online video
game to the brink of obsessiveness?  Or is it in that you've been put in
your place and, being unable to smart-ass your way out of it, you cry like a
bitch with a skinned elbow to someone's ISP, claiming (among other things),
"Waaaaaa, Waaaaaa...  Johnny_Jackass pushed me down and I want his
playground privileges suspended.", when you could have just kill filed him
and let it go.

Ohhhhh, you're serious about your little newsgroup.  Tough shit, junior.
Public forum means I can sit right here and scream it on the mountain what a
hypocritical ass you are, and there's not a goddamned thing you can do about
it, short of coming to my home and putting a bullet through my head, and I
seriously doubt you're that hard-up to have your ass handed to you.  Do
yourself a favor.  If you don't want to read my pearls of wisdom, block me.
It's easy, and it's fun.  Just look at all the dingbats who've done it
already.  Go ahead.  Be a sheep.
