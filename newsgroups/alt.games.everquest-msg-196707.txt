I know too much about this topic. I have made PRBS coders and decoders
in FPGAs for a communication product. I had to detect the sequence and
synch up to the sequence.

It depends on the pattern. If I assume it is a standard PRBS 2^32-1
sequence, there is a standard polynomial used for that. The sequence
is 4,294,967,295 sequences long, taken bit wise, if we assume 32 bit
integers it is about 150 million numbers per sequence. Luckly there is
an out.

If I know they used the standard function, the polynomial, for the
pattern, I can duplicate the pattern with only 32 bits of the data.
There are a finite number of polynomials that give you the full
pattern. Now, I don't know what they actually used.

The seed is simply the starting point for the sequence. Everything
else repeats. The same random number sare also used for everything
else in EQ I bet, so knowing what the next number is will be rough,
and I can't think of any way to stop all calls to the random generator
except for the casino.

I wish I could predict it, I would publish the casino beaters guide
for $14.95 and a backrub...
