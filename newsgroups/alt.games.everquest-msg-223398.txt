The *only* thing, in fact, for many. With 260+ AA and 98% into level 65
who gives a donkeys about XP? And for anyone who does care about XP there
tend to be better places to earn it than LDON. Ldon seems to me to be
solely about getting adventure points for augments and phat lewties with
the added bonus of a passable amount of XP.

The trick is generally do a mission as fast as possible, keep the group,
*and then do another*. If I can do 3 slaughters in the time it takes to
do 2 collects, slaughters win every time. I'm still making XP, but I'm
making way more of the thing that matters... AP.

And yes, I do LDON in pickup groups too ;)

They're never really that tough, provided you have a strong healer or
a strong tank. Its only if you have a weak tank without the heal power
to compensate its an issue, and as an admittedly well geared and AA'd
ranger, I've done assassinates at 65 with druid healing.

LDON just doesnt seem to be that hard to me... Collects are *irritating*,
especially with a low drop rate and high mob density dungeon, and I dont
play to be irritated, but yeah, to fail you either have to be doing a
hard mission or playing with a stupid group setup - I've gone in with
pickup druid as healer, necro as CC, etc, for a 4 person group and lost,
but then, I didnt really expect to win and they were friendly so we had
fun.

I'd really like a mission somewhere between normal and hard though... Normal
is just so easy its boring and hard is ... well, too hard to convince anyone
not in a time capable guild they want to do it, in my experience. Which
is a shame, as its hellish fun ;)

Mmm. I really have no idea how anyone can have waited around for 15 minutes
deciding adventure types... the delay really isnt that long.
