Not sure what all you're replying to since I don't see rumble's posts
but just to comment on your answer. I think EQ is pretty well
balanced, med time wise, if you're in a full group. Even w/o KEI
pretty much any group of 6 can fight with no, or minimal, downtime. It
breaks down when you start talking about soloing or doing small groups
but I really don't see a nice, easy way to fix that. 

Rgds, Frank
