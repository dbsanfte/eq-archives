As I said twink raids have not happened in ages.  If you see me playing my
warrior down in that list in my signature, likely in Dawnshroud Peaks, feel
free to send me a tell, if we have room in the group, you'd be welcome to
join.  Usually have a 32ish cleric, 31 shaman, my 30 warrior, sometimes a 40
warrior, sometimes a 32 enchanter instead of the shaman, sometimes a 27ish
rogue.
