Though you read this group through the EMarr forums, a.g.e is actually
part of a larger medium called "usenet".  Usenet predates the web by
over a decade, and as such there was originally no place to which to
refer people for things like FAQs.  Though things have evolved somewhat,
it's still the case that some people reading usenet groups do not have
access to a browser, and thus it remains the convention that FAQs are
re-posted at regular intervals.  (Once per month is common.)  Posting
the FAQ to the group also ensures that archive sites such as "Google
Groups" will have up-to-date copies on file in case my web site were to
vanish suddenly.

I'm not familiar with the EMarr forum format, but I can't imagine it's
that hard to skip past the FAQ posts.  Or perhaps you might bookmark the
FAQ web site, and when you see the monthly post take that as a signal to
go check the site and see what's new.  (The web site version generally
has links from the "what's changed" section to the actual changes.)

In any event, thank you for the feedback.  Perhaps I should add your
question (and this answer) to the FAQ.  (Seriously.)
