Hate crime suspected in attacks in Ballard: 4 men crashed party, beat up
'white guys'

By Ian Ith
Seattle Times staff reporter


Seattle police are trying to track down four Hispanic men for possible
hate-crime charges after they crashed a house party in Ballard early
yesterday and trounced several white guests because they felt like "beating
up some white guys," police said.

A 17-year-old Crown Hill boy suffered head and body injuries and remained in
serious condition at Harborview Medical Center yesterday.

Partygoers at the house in the 1500 block of Northwest 60th Street told
police that the four, in their 20s, showed up uninvited about 12:30 a.m. All
were dressed alike in blue FUBU-brand jackets and black pants.

A teenage girl was holding the party in her home because her mother was out
of town, police said. No one knew the four men.

One of the men asked a partygoer, a 21-year-old black man, "Do you feel like
beating some white guys?" according to a police report.

The black man said no and stepped out back to smoke. When he came back
inside, he told police, he saw the men jump the white Crown Hill teen, knock
him to the floor and punch and kick him repeatedly.

Another partygoer tried to help the teen, but the attackers punched him in
the face several times, police said. Several other guests also were punched,
police said.

The attackers left the Crown Hill teen lying on the front steps and ran to a
red or maroon Toyota Corolla, witnesses said. Then two came back and kicked
the teen in the head a few more times. Then they all sped off in the car.

Police say the girl who hosted the party could be charged with alcohol
possession. After sending everyone home, officers collected about 50 beer
and liquor bottles from the house.
