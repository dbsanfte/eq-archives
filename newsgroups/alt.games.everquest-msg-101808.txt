Here's the deal... While in OOT yesterday, a discussion about GMs came
up in /ooc and their abilities. One person came out and mentioned
about their stealth mode ( They don't show on /who lists when anon or
even /who all <name>, and their complete invis that can't be seen by
see invis ), using a sob story about how evil it was because a GM
warned him for FD training a group. See, the group had been taking
"his" spawn and the guy decided the GM was taking too long to answer
the petition, so he switched characters and took "justice" into his
own hands.

Naturally, I let him know it was his own damn fault for being warned
for doing something he KNEW would get him warned if he was caught, and
he was a bigger asshole than the group for causing them xp loss and a
potentially dangerous corpse run. He decided to argue about how he
beleives in an "eye for an eye" and some bullshit and how the GMs
should have gotten there sooner to catch the spawn stealers (as if
they would have done anything, as the spawn stealers weren't breaking
any game rules). Eventually, he proceeded to ignore me for being
"immature" because I "attacked" him unprovoked.

Some people.
