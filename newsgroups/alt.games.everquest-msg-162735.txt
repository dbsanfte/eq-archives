I can single or double pull almost all of Juggs already, and was doing so at
60.  ; )

I pulled for a bard trakanon raid, and did so with a hell of a lot less adds
then the last time I saw it monk pulled. ; )

Not really relevant with our group.  We don't have a bard with us on any
kind of a regular basis.  Shaman haste is pathetic, and the shaman has no
mana regen.  We don't have a beastlord to group with, but even if we did,
thier slows are pretty poor, and thier haste a pale imitation of the
shaman's, and thier clarity/regen, while somewhat nice, isn't going to make
a party.  No necros that I would group with, and no all-undead camps to go
to if I did, also no haste...  Whats left, ranger using earthcaller?  heh.
