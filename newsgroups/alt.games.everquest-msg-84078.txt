I do a lot of drive-bys as well, with my druid. And I generally assume, like
you, that everyone I encounter ingame is going to be something like 12 years
old. I'm sometimes pleasantly surprised. I've been getting a LOT of
drive-bys myself lately, (and I have wondered why the numbers have gone up
on this!), mostly from enchanters but sometimes from druids casting skin
like diamond. I always find time, even if it's 5 minutes later, to thank
them in a private /tell.
