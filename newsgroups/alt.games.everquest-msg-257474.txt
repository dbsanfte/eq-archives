I've been soloing the entrance area with my Beastlord since he had basically
just turned 65 with no AA's and crappy gear. Yesterday I was there 3-boxing
with the 65 bst, a 65 enc and a 59 wizzy and could crawl around on the
corridors with no trouble whatsoever.

Mob difficulty is tier2 PoP. Think PoV, level 60'ish mobs hitting for 500's
or so. Loot is about the same too, just the occasional EP or diamond to
write home about.


Oh, and PS: Everyone please go away, I want to keep the zone for myself,
mmmkay? =)
