Yep ;)

Yep, and for soloing casters their downtime plummet. Verant don't like
to do that.

Same here. The mana regen things are nice and my druid will forgo xp
(since I can't seem to get beyond the middle of 55 really anyway) for
a while to generate xp for skills. I'll go for faster mana regen and
that perm charm (which would of course be for animals) probably first
thing out of the gate. Unless I hear that the perm charm really sucks
and only works for low level beasts.
