True that,

I game in the same room as two good friends of mine.  The other day I heard
one of them shout out 'Oh, you have got to be kidding me!!'.  On Drinal, a
*guild* named Tastes Like Chicken.

When he talked to a guide about it, the answer was 'oh that must be an
American reference, being Canadian I've never heard it before..'  Um, we're
Canadian too...

Don't think the guide would have appreciated the suggested response (not
typed to him) 'No, thats a post puberty reference, now find me someone who's
nuts have dropped and has a clue'.

The debate went on for half an hour between my friend and this guide ending
in basically a politely phrased 'Suck it up, you are wasting my time.'.

Of course, the follow up to that is to make a guild called Smells Like Fish
and see where it goes from there. /gag

The Naming Convention is dead, and I deeply mourn its loss.
