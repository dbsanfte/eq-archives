GF2MX400(64) - Athlon 1200, 512MB
GF2MX200(32) - Athlon 700, 512MB

1024x768 on both.  I was at 1280 but decided to lower it to help a LITTLE
with FPS.

A guild member of mine studied the problem and also came to the conclusion
that 768MB RAM is what this game needs now to act like it did before SoL.
Now, he's a Linux geek and a general computer geek with no particular RAM
specialty as far as I know, so take it with a grain of salt.  I may borrow
some RAM from my 3rd machine though. :)
