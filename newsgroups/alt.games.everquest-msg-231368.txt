No, because the religion is part of a necromancer's training. You can
RP an agnostic necromancer, but that would come after your training.
You're going to be recognized as a follower of whatever religion your
home's necromancer guild teaches even if you've abandoned the
religion.

Kinda like a parent, no matter how good and loving, can be driven to
put a lying, cheating, stealing child out on the street after taking
so much crap from them. :p I think the "forsaking" is a combination of
turning away because of anger over the actions of mortals and seeking
refuge for their own safety.

An avid follower of whatever deity will still feel that if they
increase their dedication to their deity and get others to do the
same, they can repent for the sins of mortals enough for the pantheon
(or at least their own god) to return to Norrath.
