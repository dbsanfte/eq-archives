120 mobs..  mobs that require a players 100% full attention (meaning a great
player couldnt deal with 5).. meaning you have to actually have that many
ppl present (and something that is a constant action event, so bots are
ruled out)

When the event ends, 72 of those 120 mobs were "flag" mobs - whoever
happened to be assigned that mob will loot a <something> as their flag.
That way youy can't get guild2 to flag you, and then leave them be while you
explore Time... you have to go through it as a collective team to get
everybody flagged

The reason Id love to see it so much, is cuz I know how much guilds hate
their rivals... and it would be massively entertaining to see if they
overcame that bs, to get into PoTime...  would truly be an epic event
