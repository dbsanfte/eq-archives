He's been reading this newsgroup enough to know that it pisses people
off, since this seems to be a weekly occurance.

My reader doesn't interpret HTML, and do to personal preference,
security concerns, and a general respect for the fucking medium of
Usenet, I will continue to use a REAL newsreader.  (Outlook Express is
many things, but the ONLY time I've ever used it to read news was on a
Solaris box, where it can't do anything stupid, and it performs
slightly better than Netscape.  I had it set up to not interpret HTML
too.)  Just because some moron pisses on the floor of your house
doesn't mean it's acceptable.

It's a standard and a convention.  If you want to be a dick, you can
start speaking only in Pig-Latin, and there is nothing that anyone can
do about it.  If you want to get your point across though, and if
everyone else is speaking in English, then you should speak English.
Even though I can understand Pig-Latin, I'm not going to be bothered
to try.
