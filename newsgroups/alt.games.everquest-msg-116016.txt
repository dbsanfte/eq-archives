I always used to do that (much much faster, and maxed swimming never
goes astray), until last weekend, when I discovered that jumping off the
boat as soon as it zones into Butcherblock, then swimming towards the
dock but somewhat downwards, will find you falling through space,
watching the ocean recede into the distance above you.

Of course, I had to try this several times to make sure it wasn't a
fluke. All a lot of harmless fun until I found out what casting Shadow
Step while falling under the world does.
