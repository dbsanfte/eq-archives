Anyone that duels an enchanter is plain stupid and likely to loose at the
very least some experience in the game although on the other hand they may
gain valuable insights concerning life.  Basically, if you are stupid enough
to accept such a duel then you deserve what you get and I would not expect
the enchanter to be punished for doing what is expected of them.  Moreover,
even if the enchanter only feared or charmed his or her victim and dotted
them to death they are going to loose experience.  To expect an enchanter to
do otherwise is more than unreasonable, since dots and mez/charm/fear are
their major weapons. While I imagine the wizard did petition and raise quite
a stink I serious doubt that the petition received any positive response and
if it did would have to question the judgment of whoever handed out a
suspension.
