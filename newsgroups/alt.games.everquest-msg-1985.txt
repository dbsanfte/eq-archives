The advantage of a lightstone or GLS is that you don't have to be
holding it for it to work--you can just have it in an inventory slot
(this goes for beetle eyes as well).  

As for the "cycling" you speak of, that's due to the way the game
engine does the lighting calculations.  It's annoying but you have to
live with it.
