I got this idea from the reality that in EQ to get a rare drop, it 
required a substantial amount of time. That is what made the item rare.

If the spawn is rare and contested odds are good there will often be 
people trying to get it.

In your vision, it sounds like if I want an X, I just whip through the  
quest to get the and (based on your other post) will get my triggered 
spawn in a couple minutes, worst case an hour.

I think that is as 'push button convenient' as instancing is if not 
moreso. And worse because it doesn't allow for low-mid level, solo. and 
one group scripted encounters. (micro raids as it were)... because i can 
always have my whole entire guild beside me trivializing all the 
content, up to the point that you reach at EQs endgame where you -need- 
the whole entire guild beside you just to challenge the content.

And that's poor game design, if all the content is trivializable until 
endgame. Its part of what has made EQ impossible to balance. They -
can't- put a good drop on a mid level challenge mob because if they do 
it will be farmed by the ubers. Nobody fights even Negafen on his own 
terms... a few 70ths clear out the giants and buff the 'raid', and this 
trivializes the encounter for the 'level appropriate people' who engage 
him.
