It would be quite easy to do without filling the game up with junk. In
CoH and Guild Wars players can recolour items or add patterns to them.
They have no tangible benefits other then aesthetics. No reason why EQ2
can't do the same. The piece of armour still essentially the same
just a different colour. Be easy to allow players to buy dyes, gold
leaf etc that could be added to armour via an appropriate tradeskill.

The char customization is in the wrong part of the game. You can pick
many different colours of underwear or facial tweaks but neither really
show up in game. Yet armour, which is very visible, is always the same.
