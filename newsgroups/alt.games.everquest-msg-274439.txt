There would BE NO bandwidth, servers, GMs, advertising, or R & D.
That's the whole point!  The sole working feature of the game would be
the billing.

If it were true that you could make a game where nothing had to work
and you could cancel any account at any time for any reason without
giving any refunds, then what's stopping me from making a game with NO
features and cancelling EVERYONE's account and just running away with
the 1st month's fees?

It's illegal, that's what's stopping me.  It's fraud.

Of course it's a foolish example.  It takes what all these people are
saying --- "Blizzard can do whatever they want because it is their game
and you have no say in the matter" --- to an extreme, in order to point
out how ridiculous a claim that is.  Their EULA and TOS basically say
they guarantee nothing whatsoever about the game will ever work.  You
really think Blizzard could leave the login servers down for a month,
charge everyone's credit cards, and then point to the TOS saying they
do not guarantee 100% availability as an excuse???  You can put
whatever you like in a contract, but that doesn't mean it's going to
hold up in court.

So, Lee, before taking a patronizing tone, how about more sarcasm
detection?
