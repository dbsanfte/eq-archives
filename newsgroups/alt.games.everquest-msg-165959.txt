Entry of the Hole. Mid forties, assuming you survive, hands down the
best xp I found in that level range. The ZEM in the Hole is insane. It
never get's bad. We're duoing currently down at the castle. The entry
stuff is all light blue in the high fifties, but the rock golems, rats
and ghosts are all dark blue and great xp. In the mid forties, you can
bang out crazy xp off the elemental warriors near the entry.
