Sorry to hear that but I have seen plenty of role-playing and partaken in a
fair bit myself. Of course it isn't the norm and is never kept up 100% but
it's there. I always *try* to make sure any /says are in character, as are
shouts.
I really hate the shouts I see in EC of "I want to make a XXXX what race is
the best?"
FFS you've worked out what class, you can work out the rest...sheeesh
and as for Only be a Troll or Ogre if you're going to play a warrior,
bollocks...play a gnome if you want, just enjoy it.
I have never not made it into a group for being a weaker raced warrior.

CF
/shout Tank required, Monk preferred but will take Shaman if not
