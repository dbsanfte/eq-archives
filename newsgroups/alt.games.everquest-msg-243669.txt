But in your example, you're paying him 10 bucks for the spider silks, not
for the time he spends doing it.  For all you know he went to the baz and
bought out 250 from one of the vendors in the first six minutes and spent
the rest of the evening cybering some guy named Floyd in Rivervale.

If you gave him ten bucks to go farm silks for 4 hours, and if you came back
and discovered that he had only acquired one even though he was slaughtering
all those spiders nonstop in the Feerrott, would you be willing to do that
again, or, if you wanted 250 silks, would you pay him 2500 bucks to do the
same thing 250 times, or would you rearrange the deal to acquire a certain
number of silks for the cash, at which point the time spent doing it is
utterly irrelevant?

Holy shit, that was one sentence.
