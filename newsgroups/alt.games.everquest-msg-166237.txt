That math has been done a hundred times in this group, and so I didnt'
even bother pointing it out to Lance again. He's looking for
justification, so even a *fractional* amount of increased xp has to be
thrown into the mix. Over a three hour session, I'm willing to be I
couldn't visibly see the difference in my xp bar between grouping with
five 58's, and grouping with four 58's and a 46. It's miniscule at best.
