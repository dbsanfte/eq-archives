Only higher level bard songs fit that "bard song" slot; most bard hastes are
actually spell type hastes as far as stacking goes.

Oddly, this means a bard can actually stack two hastes on you, one spell style,
the other "song style" and have both take full haste effect.

Some items have clicky haste, this is spell haste as well, not item haste.

I believe there are a couple items that have a clicky high level song style
haste instead of spell type haste.

There is also a cap to total amount of haste allowed, I believe 100% (but
wouldn't swear to that.)  This means item haste plus spell haste are limited to
that maximum effect.  The higher level songs (the ones that stack with "spell"
haste) are not limited by this cap.  This means your maximum haste is actually
125% or so.

Now if someone could offer similar information about slows...
