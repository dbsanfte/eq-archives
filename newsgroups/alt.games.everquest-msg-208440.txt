Nah, they didn't kill the Sleeper, just triggered him with an exploit.
Of course, they tried some lame smokescreen by trying to tell people
they were banned for discovering that the script was incomplete and
that they weren't really exploiting anything (Nevermind the guild chat
logs that showed them saying flat-out that they knew they were
exploiting and could get banned for it).
