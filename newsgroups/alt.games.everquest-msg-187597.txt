Gawd, I hate dialup, took forever to download that toolkit.  And then,
it took me going line by line on the instructions to figure out how to
make the change I needed to make.  All that for one little change. 
Thanks for the help.

Anybody wanna send me a bus ticket?  My niece won't let me go home

can't leave."
