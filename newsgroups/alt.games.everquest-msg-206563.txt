After reading the previous person's message, I took my Barb Shammy to
Halas and hailed all the NPC's. No armor quests as yet. I was aware of
the Field Priest items, but was hoping for the "full-blown" versions
other races get.

As for Cabilis, same thing. There is Curscale and Leech Husk or
whatever, sorry my memory fails me at this early hour. Vah Shir have
some common armor, Ghulum comes to mind, but no class specific quests
requiring what you describe. I thoroughly enjoy these as a break from
the tedium of grinding xp, and have done almost all the various races on
different servers. Vazaelle was my "Halfling" server and Tunare was my
"Inky" server, for example.

I have my fingers crossed all races will eventually have the quests!
