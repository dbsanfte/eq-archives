You're certainly right, nothing will stop you from using Windows 98.  And in
fact, if you're happy with it and everything works, you should by no means
feel a need to upgrade.

However, XP will be marketed as "Home" and "Professional" versions (as well as
server flavors).  The Home (or maybe they call it "Personal") edition will
take the place of Windows 9x/ME on new PC's.  (At least, that is MS's hope...
how long it takes for manufacturers to do that remains to be seen.)
Therefore, it will have no choice but to become a well supported gaming
platform.  I'm not worried about this transition, for as I said, Windows 2000
already works quite well for games.

Fortunately, games that support WinXP will still support Win 9x/ME without the
developer doing a thing (assuming they continue to make DirectX upgrades
available for the older OS's, which I assume they will).  So those of us that
care (and have a near psychotic need to always have the latest and greatest)
get a stable OS on which games run, and those that are happy with what they
have don't have to change.  But more importantly, that stable OS will finally
be entering the mainstream market.

Now, if only my fears about the XP registration system could be laid to
rest... given the amount of PC upgrades I do, that scares the crap out of me.
I really, really hope MS doesn't get over zealous with that.  It's not a bad
idea on the surface, but as soon as it hinders legitimate users in any way, it
becomes a bad idea.  Hopefully they only use it in the extreme cases where
they notice 100 people using the same registration key in the space of a
couple days.  But I'm worried.
