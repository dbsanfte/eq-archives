Ok, before some smartass corrects me, I noticed that spell check didn't have
a problem with "dieing."

Yes, that's a word...but it's not the "verb transitive" (guessing, based on
what I c&p'd below) of what happens before you die.  No one does any dieing
in EQ.


From www.dictionary.com

v. tr. - died, dieï¿½ing, dies.
To cut, form, or stamp with or as if with a die.
