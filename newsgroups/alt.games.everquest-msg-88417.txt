I was going to let this drop, but I have been summoned.  Bards are fine 
melee character, and can do basically the same amount of melee damage as 
Pallys or SKs.  We wear plate, have decent AC, and learn how to control 
aggro so as NOT to be a manasink.  In ADDITION to all that, we have the 
widest variety of spells of any class, and don't have to be standing 
still like a sissy to use our spells.  
If bards are 80% caster, we're 120% melee, which equals 200%, which is 
about right.  Bards ARE as good as two of any other character.
Oh, and we run away screaming like a schoolgirl better than anyone else.  
So nyah!
