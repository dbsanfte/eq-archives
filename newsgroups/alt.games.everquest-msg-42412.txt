Because of "value added". The fact that your character is a perm
figure in the ongoing game, played from day to day and growing over
time makes it so it makes sense to pay to play. Your character being a
perm figure gives them much more overhead and makes the game far more
expensive for them to run. Far more customer service is needed than in
small games or in non perm character games. 

Diablo 2 does not cost anywhere near what everquest does since it is
not a perm world. The only thing stored on their site is your
character info, no perm world state is stored or anything like that.
It is a small server game and thousands of games are going on the
servers at any one time. None of those games are persistant though,
content is never upgraded, quests are never added, customer service is
never really that needed so nearly nonexistant, characters don't get
stuck in an area they can't leave and can't get out of because even if
they did they could just quit that game and start another one.
The difference between Diablo 2 and Everquest is about the biggest,
most different from an apple, orange that you can find.

Ridiculous, just look at it logically.
You pay for a continual world because far more cost is involved. 
9.99 for such a thing is really quite cheap and the standard price now
is rising to about 12.95 per month for new games.

Customer service, even paying flunkies 6 bucks an hour, is extremely
expensive and these games need more of it than any other kind of game.
In the future I think players will get wise and quit being such
customer service in for profit game for FREE. That really makes no
sense. The employees of a for profit game should all get paid.
Customer service will even be more expensive though then, or even more
non existant. You get what you pay for, really to approach a level of
quality and customer service that players would be comfortable with
the monthly fee might have to be more like 15 bucks. 

You get what you pay for.
