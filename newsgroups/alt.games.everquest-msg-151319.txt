True, very nice, I usually buy 2 stacks for my necro (KOS in wayyyy
too many places, but who cares, she hates everybody anyway :p) because
they last forever (luckily she was nice enough to turn in orc picks so
she can buy fizzlecutter formula for drinks).  Buuut.... there's an
easier way to get baking skill up now.  Buy or make yourself a
filleting knife.  Go to find a zone where lots of meat drops and
there's an oven nearby (or just bring along a spit).  But lots and
lots of meat from vendors.  Get your skill up higher than fish rolls
for, iirc, less (for me, bear/wolf/whatever meat tends to cost less
than fresh fish + batwing).  Fillets, unfortunately, are just a meal,
not banquet sized.  So if you want your food to last a long time (not
necessarily a good thing if you plan on making stacks and stacks while
skilling up ;p) go for the fish rolls.
