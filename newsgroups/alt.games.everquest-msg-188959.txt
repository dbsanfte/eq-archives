Look into the Radeon 9500 PRO (must be Pro!)  It's right
around your target pricerange and it really kicks some
compered to the GF4s of equivalent price when you turn
on the anti-aliasing and ansiotropic filtering.

I'm wanting a 9500 Pro, but unfortunately, my GF3 Ti200
does "good enough" for me that I cannot justify the
grade.

If money is no object, the 9700 Pro (like the other
poster suggested) is the best.

BTW, ATI is releasing a new 9800 and 9600 which I'm
hoping will cause the 9500 and 9700s to drop in price
a decent amount.  I've been a bit disappointed at how
little video card prices are moving since Nvidia
dropped the ball and is not providing any real
competition to ATI.  Worst Buy wants $170 for a
GF4 Ti4200 which is just way too much for a 9 month
old card (esp when the Radeon 9500 Pro is available
for that much on pricewatch).  The 9700s are still
ringing-up at $300 and up.  I can't wait for some
competition in this market again to get the prices
moving!
