I don't see any problem at all with the original poster's request. If
you choose to ignore it, fine. If you opt for the clean language
clause, better. One person walking into a crowd of people and asking
them all to please watch their language is not infringing upon
*anyone*.

It's no secret that foul language is rude/offensive/wrong. If you
choose to use it, you can't fault anyone for asking you to stop. The
*only* problem with free speech is that some use it as a license to
act a fool.
