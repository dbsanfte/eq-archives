If it's dropping him back to login, I'd be suspicious of the network as
well...  Also, you might see what new goodies have been installed on the
system.  Some programs conflict with EQ loading - I have discovered that the
client program for Radio@Netscape will cause a conflict ONLY during the game
load - ONLY after you select the server and hit play...  I think it is
because the radio program is aware of the display resolution, and wants to
restart if the resolution changes...  anyway, it freezes up the entire
computer and the only solution I've found is to restart.  (If I wait to
start the radio AFTER the program gets to the character selection screen,
all the programs are happy to run at the same time...)

He may have installed something that is unhappy with EQ's desire to pretty
much control everything about the system... mouse, video, sound, etc...
that could be causing the conflict...

Also, of course, check for trojan horses, spyware, adware, and viruses!!
