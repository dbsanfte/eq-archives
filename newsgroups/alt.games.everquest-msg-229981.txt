The mobs he is referring to are in Twilight Sea and are mid 30s if my
memory serves me right with a particularly annoying lifetap proc.  A
friend went to ST to grab some supplies and left after killing 27 mobs
without a drop so that's fairly strong - if anecdotal - evidence that
the devs felt swirling shadows were too 'easy' to farm in that
particular zone at least.
