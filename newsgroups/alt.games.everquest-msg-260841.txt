Actually, I see one really, really primo use for this, that might almost make 
it worth turning on.  Very late night camping.  Change one of your macro 
thingys to make a really loud noise, and run everything else silently as 
usual.  Tell your groupmates exactly which very loud noise to spam you with if 
they suspect your face has hit the keyboard again, or the mob you've waited 2 
hours for has finally popped.

I've long thought it would be nice if there was a way people could wake me up, 
so I could at least get that extra five minutes of shuteye with less guilt and 
danger. :) Now the late-night camping of some slow spawn can easily be done in 
shifts!  5 people sleep, and one sounds the alarm if Annoying_Epic_NPC_001 
actually shows up.  Who's got first watch? :)
