}>...I always thought social aggro chained...  Hm.  That's got to be useful

}Its very useful. Frequently there are cases where are 2 clusters of
}mobs close together.  And a mob that wanders.
}Assuming no lulling. If you pull the wanderer when he's safely out of
}the area you'll get him all by himself, but no easy way to proceed. If
}you pull any mob in either cluster social aggro pulls both clusters. .
}But If you pull the wanderer when he's a little closer to the  near
}cluster you will end up with the first cluster + wanderer. This vastly
}superior to ending up with both clusters. I use this tactic all the
}time.

Hmm...  Ok, that proves to my satisfaction that mobs have a smaller aggro 
range for socially-aggroed mobs versus directly aggroed ones.

}>  How can we test it to be sure? 
}> Of course, there's an 
}>intermediate case to make it more difficult.  What if, a mob can be 
}>social aggroed by a passing aggro mob within radius r, or a passing 
}>socially aggroed mob within radius r/2, or a passing socially^2 aggroed 
}>mob within r/4, etc? 
}Hmm there could be something to that.
} ie if a socially aggroed mob has bad pathing and runs through other
}mobs he might aggro them (i can't think of any good example at the
}moment).

Pathing ruins so many good controlled experiments. :)  What if the 
socially-aggroed mobs in the previous experiment don't aggro the second 
clump because they path differently than if they were directly aggroed? 
hmm.

}So socially aggroed mobs might actually just have a dramatically
}reduced agro range... I would be surprised if there was a diminishing
}condition where it differentiated between socially aggroed and
}socially aggroed by socially aggroed...

Yea, I'd expect r, r/2, r/2,.... r/2 is much more likely, since it'd be 
much easier to program.  But Verant's freaky, I wouldn't put it past em. 
:)

}> Hmmm...  Where can we find some sets of 
}>evenly-spaced social mobs with different spacings...
}You'd need sets of the *same* social mobs evenly spaced. Aggro radius
}is a mob characteristic, not a game constant.

Yea, I assumed that part was obvious. :) Of course, now we also need them 
to be in an area with perfectly straightforward pathing. :)  The only 
things I can think of for even spacing is Rathe Council (maybe? it sounds 
like something that'd be evenly spaced...), which I've never seen and am 
not likely to, or those two wings full of evenly-spaced guards in Thurg, 
but I bet those are a pathing nightmare. And I think there's a wanderer in 
there.
