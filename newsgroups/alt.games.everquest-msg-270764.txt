I think EQ1 is among the simplest of mmogs that I've ever played. I'm 
not sure why you'd even think of suggesting that it was complex.

I would agree that EQ2 is "harder" than WoW, but not because its more 
complex, or more advanced, or anything but the raw fact that progression 
is slower and you need a group to progress at all at a reasonable speed. 

So you'll get farther in the same amount of time in WoW. But that's more 
owing to EQ2 being less generous with the XP, particularly on soloable 
content than anything to do with 'complexity'.

We can all agree with that. Why not just stick with that instead of 
trying to elevate EQ2 as being the 'advanced title'? :)
