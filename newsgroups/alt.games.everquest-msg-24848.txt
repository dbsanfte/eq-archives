Hehe, you do know that any Mob can proc any weapon (used to work for pets,
too but was nerfed) as if they had 200dex. But I guess, greater the risk
greater the reward :�) I ran into some derves wielding velium weapons once,
made the fight a little hard than I expected for my SK.
One of these days I'm gonna dump a sword of skyfire and Glowing black sword
on Slate and see what he can do :�)
Ok no I'm not but that'd be a scary thought.
