Definitely.

About 1.5x the dps and 2x the hp.  And yeah, though if you could just barely
survive the trash the named is gonna work you over.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Not a whole lot more than on normal, they just hit like mack trucks.

Until the bard runs out of mana, they can reliably pull singles anywhere. 
Once they switch to needing to lull, probably not.

I'd have to ask how the pally ranks against the SK in gear.  Might be better
to have the pally tank and leave the SK free to pull if that is workable for
you.  On hard, I'd definitely watch adds carefuly.  When the trash is
hitting for 900s, shamans and enchanters tend to drop dead with very little
notice.
