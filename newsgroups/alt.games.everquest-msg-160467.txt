I've never done the camp, so correct me if I'm wrong, but the PH's
are Seafure Cyclops, correct?  A L29 Wizard cannot stick a spell
on a mob with a minimum level of 39.  And a 30ish Warrior isn't
gonna tank that mob either, especially with only a 30ish Cleric
to support.  Sorry, your suggested group cannot hold the camp,
they probably couldn't get a Seafury down to 50% even if they were
twinked to the limit.  And a 29 Wizard can't contribute at all to
the fight (unless you count his 1 hp DS that he gets at L1) so,
plain and simple, a L29 Wizard with JBoots is a twink.
