I certainly know what you mean. That *was*, however, the beginning of 
the downward trend for me - when I started concentrating on amassing 
wealth with which to buy gear that was far above my level.

Nah, no sense in being too strict about it. Drive-by buffs are a 
wonderful thing. They're part of what's right about EQ, and I wouldn't 
want to prevent that from occurring. I would be more concerned with 
people making a point of seeking it out.

That also sounds reasonable. Naturally one would look to their 
guildmates for assistance first. In the absence of that, however, I 
would think one would try to avoid farming for plat with which to afford 
purchasing of those services from others. Farm your own components, 
sure, but avoiding taking the easy route to gaining plat (farming 
anything purely for sale) would be one of the fundamental concepts.

Interacting with the rest of the populace would certainly be encouraged. 
It's just the taking advantage of means by which one might accellerate 
the development of their character beyond its level that would be 
frowned upon. At level 20, I could group with anyone of similar level, 
even those who are equipped with gear it would take a level 50+ raid 
force to acquire. I just don't have to give in to the temptation of 
chasing that high-level gear anytime too soon in doing so.

Few things would need to be necessarily written in stone. I don't 
foresee specific stipulations being included in some sort of complex 
guild charter and ruleset. I imagine it will be a simple set of 
fundamental ideas that the initial leadership will agree upon and 
regularly evaluate against the tendencies of the guild members. Any 
perceived inconsistencies in this regard would certainly be discussed, 
including the member in question. I would hope that anyone who may turn 
out to be a bit too "progressive" (for lack of a better term) in their 
approach to the game could part ways amicably manner and remain a friend 
of the guild.

The fact of the matter is that I would hope that those interested in 
joining the guild would be sufficiently informed in in complete 
agreement with these core concepts before they ever make the commitment.

I'm looking forward to getting this started.
