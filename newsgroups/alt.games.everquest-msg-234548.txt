Agility does nearly nothing for AC, once you are at 75 agil. At that
point you can more or less forget about it, only going for AC. At
level 60 the difference between 74 agil and 75 agil will be about 40
ac, other values are no where near so dramatic.

Any monk race will already be at 75 agil or more, so you have nothing
to worry about. Just go for AC.

For example, I just raised the agility on a level 40 sk troll by 20
points. It went from ac 912 in full gear, to ac 915 in full gear. That
is a TWENTY difference in Agility. Base agil was originally 83 and I
switched it to 103 in the magelo. As you can see, it would always make
more sense to raise AC instead of Agil. The only time getting some
agility would make sense is if you were at 74 or less agility.

Closer to 75 seems to maybe make more of a difference, but once you
are at 90 or more in gear you really get small returns even if adding
a load of agility.

As you can see it would have also made nearly know sense to dump a lot
of creation points into agility on this character. They would be
better used somewhere else. Now if you had an OGRE sk, I believe you
start below 75 agil (70 if I remember right), so you'd want to dump
some into agil to go for the minimum of 75, then perhaps some more as
a cushion. Several good items you might eventually get, such as the
lodizal shield, LOWER agil. So its best to be a bit above the 75
minimum.
