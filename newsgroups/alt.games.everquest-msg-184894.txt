Not, it's people getting booted.  Ever used a 56k dialup to browse the
Internet (before you start I have a good, reliable cable connection)
that has no trouble during off hours, but drops the connection over
and over during peak usage hours?  The client computer isn't
disconnecting, it is being dropped because the server has _too many_
clients.  That doesn't mean your web browser closes.  It means that a
server dropped you.

Lucky you.  I had never seen this phenomenon.  The very day they
'improved' the bandwidth usage, it began.  I don't get dropped, I just
go to near-link-death.
