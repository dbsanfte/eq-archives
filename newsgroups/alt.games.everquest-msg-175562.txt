We set up the group at the zoneline.  I did the turn-in, turned and ran back
to the group.  If the cleric jumps off the balcony, they can get back to the
group and ready well before the mob will appear with just about zero
chance of the mob aggroing another or doing serious damage to the cleric.
I didn't even get hit when I did mine.   Other than the "pull," it's an easy
fight.

I did a couple of practice runs;  the one thing you absolutely don't want is
to get lost trying to get back to the zone. :)
