Servers say they are up (on http://www.everquest.com) but I can't get past
login server. I downloaded the patch files, tried to log in, got to the
server select, and as soon as I'd see my character select screen, "YOU HAVE
BEEN DISCONNECTED!". Tried again, same thing. Then while running around same
thing again, now can't even log in past username and password screen. It
gives error 1001 saying to try again later.  Emergency patch? Cable cut?
Router problems? Sony hired Miï¿½ro$oft programmers to write the latest patch?

Anyone else having same or similar problems?
