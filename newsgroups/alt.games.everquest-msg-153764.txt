I may well have "greatly missed the point" you had not yet made.
OTOH, you have clearly missed the point that I will make below.

There are <many> EQ players, probably even <most> EQ players, who do
not obsess over achieving the maximum possible efficiency at mechanicly
grinding up the NPCs they battle.  This does <not> in any way shape or
form make these players jackasses.  Quite the contrary, you are acting
out a quite convincing jackass by demanding that they "go roll a real
character".  There's an enormous difference between using your EQ char
as a tool to achieve something, and playing an imaginary character who
goes out and meets challenges in an imaginary world to the best of her
abilities.  If we (not our characters, but we the people behind them)
were confronting an actual life-and-death challenge that required the
absolute best ultra-specialized tool to give the best chance for
survival, then, and only then, the healer who brought a Druid tool
instead of a Cleric tool would be a jackass.  EQ is a fantasy role-
playing GAME ferpetesake!  Not a life and death struggle for the people
behind the toons, but an opportunity to do FUN things in an imaginary
environment.  Seeing you refer to "some jackass druid", in the manner
and context which you used, is really a sad commentary on the self-
styled "uber" members of this community (EQ).

Kaev <--- more and more glad every day that he simply doesn't have
what it takes to be "uber"
