Well, a quick summary of my opinion on it.

My girlfriend got in, and I've stolen one of her character slots. ;)
(Limited to 4, hopefully that's just a beta thing and not going to
carry over to retail.) I'll say from the start that I'm not overly
impressed. It's enjoyable, yes. I don't know if it's the pace of the
combat or the fact that even as low as level 7 I was having my ass
handed to me by even cons, but it just didn't grab me. It is pretty,
and the screenshots don't do the character models justice. I guess it
was just the feel of the game overall. I liked it, but I think I'm
going to end up liking WoW better. My girlfriend loves it, though.
I'll probably steal one of her slots in retail as well and play on her
account now and then. (After all, she's going to be hijacking a slot
on my WoW account. ;) )
