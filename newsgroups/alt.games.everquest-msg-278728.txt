Well, I'm a firm believer that clerics should be the premier healing class 
and that druids and shaman should be made more effective within their own 
classes. I play a shaman and begging for better heals just makes me feel 
cheap. It seems that the only reason the shaman community might accept that 
as any sort of class balancing is the fact that we have trouble envisioning 
any other options.

Several classes having the same key abilities is class balance done wrong, 
IMO. Sure, they would each be just as desirable in a group, but when it 
doesn't matter which one you take, then you've got too many classes. Make 
me more like a shaman, not more like a cleric.
