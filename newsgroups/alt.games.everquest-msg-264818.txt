I believe that Alfred Ironforge will ask your choice anytime after arriving 
from the Isle. Since he's in Qeynos city, you won't be able to see him until 
you're level 7. When I first started beta you could change your choice 
anytime up until you hit 10 and adopted one of the trades, not sure how it's 
working now.
