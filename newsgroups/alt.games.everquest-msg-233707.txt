As others have stated, go to your socials tab in the Actions window and
create a hot button there with something like the following:

line 1:  /cast 1
line 2:  /cast 1
line 3:  /cast 1
line 4: /g Through Tunare's blessing, I cast CHEAL on %t in 10 seconds. Stay
near, %r.

The reason I attempt the cast 3 times is to account for fizzles. If you
succeed on any of the casts, the other lines will be ignored with some sort
of "Can't do that at this time" message, so no harm done. The number of
times that you'll see that message, however, will illustrate how many times
your spell *would* have fizzled, but didn't.
