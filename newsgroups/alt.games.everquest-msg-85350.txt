 If you can avoid line of sight you'd probably be ok. Mobs can land
spells on you without LoS but they (usually) need LoS to begin casting.
Indoors anyway. I'm not sure how it works outdoors since walls aren't
necessarily walls.

 Magi/Frenzy is usually camped so Hand will be regularly pulled. It's
probably easier to go there and see if anyone would let you loot it.
