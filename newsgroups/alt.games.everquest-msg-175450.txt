Oh, I'm determined to get it done, I just wish it didn't have to take as
long.  There is NO WAY I'm farming skeletons to get the chips tho, I just
buy em from the bazaar for 5gp a peice, I've made somebody happy from buying
all the chips he puts up forsale everynight.  The reason I won't give up is
because having manaless, componentless mini-avatar (+40 to STR, STA, AGI and
DEX) that stacks with HoS and Focus could really be useful.  I may buy
avatar at some point but paying 10pp per cast is nuts when it only lasts
6minutes IMO.
