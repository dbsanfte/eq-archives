Not a chance in hell.  I think no-drop is one of the worst concepts Sony
ever came up with, exacerbated by the fact that their own game mechanics
which *shouldn't* be affected by no-drop are.  If tribute or guild tribute
worked with no-drop, most of my issues with no-drop would be gone.

By the way, one concept worse than no-drop is the "no loot from greens" on
Firiona Vie, thus explaining why I never played there.  =)

I might consider an "all attuneable" server a good idea.  I still wouldn't
go to it, not that it would make a difference for me personally since I
think I finally replaced my last piece of droppable gear last week.  On the
other hand, I might actually be able to buy an upgrade again, something that
hasn't happened for years now.
