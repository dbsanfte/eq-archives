About 2 years ago I was an avid EQ player with a Half-Elf Ranger, a gnome
(never play one of those) mage and a rouge inkie (just a baby). Now I am
starting again over Christmas break and I was wondering 2 things. 1) I have
the old Ruins of Kunark software, should I upgrade and 2) what race/class
should I start out on to get back in the swing. I was thinking the Half-Elf
combo. Thanks!
