They're considered popular posters because dorks who come in here an pick 
flamewars with them invariably startwhining about their popularity.  I 
would definitely say they are prolific, but popular is very hard to 
measure.  If we use the yardstick of 'number of stalkers acquired', they 
clearly rule the group. :)  They also, though, make lots of good, 
informative, posts that arent a pack of lies.  This may also contribute to 
their popularity.

}> Your ability to not make any sense is truly stunning.  The lie here,
}> is that you said top posters were flamed to pieces just for top
}> posting in this newsgroup.  Hal was not, in fact, flamed to pieces,
}> he was asked nicely and politely to change his ways, and you chose to

}Here is actually what I said in that post:

Yes, we all read it 12 times by now.  Did it occur to you to link it 
instead of quoting the whole thing?

}Oh give it a rest .... you and some others 

'You' there, would be referring to Lance, whom you followed up to.

}seem to insist on this
}ridiculous convention in this particular newsgroup (I have not met 
}another newsgroup that is as rabid about this practice)... since you are 
}not moderators just killfile the top posters rather than seeming like the 
}little boys you appear to be.

And here, you acuse Lance of seeming like a 'little boy' for saying 
please.  Smooove!

}When I posted almost a year ago a number of references on this matter
}about top posting and the fact that it did adhere to "Netiquette" some of 
}you were reduced to vitriol and abuse. Just let the top posters alone or 
}ignore them if it offends your sensibilities.

Aye, whenever someone brings up this boring-ass topic and persists with 
it, people get aggravated with them.  You are yet to show -any- evidence 
that we are unprovokedly rude to top posters.

}> And, you were flaming Lance Berg.  It was admittedly a mild flame,
}> but of all people... Lance is easily one of the top ten nicest and
}> politest posters in this group, for the six months a year he's
}> around, right up there with Annie and Monual (why is it always the
}> clerics? hmm.)  But he is hardly one to be reduced to vitriol and
}> abuse.
}I used Lance's post to point out the futility of abusing top posters a
}la Bizbee et al.  I agree he is a lovely guy. In the first paragraph I
}was talking to Lance and the second to the newsgroup in general.

Well, why'd you call him a 'little boy' in the first paragraph, then?  
Why'd you call him and some others 'little boys' if you didn't want the 
bejesus flamed out of you?

}> Well, now you've gone and done it, I've gone back through the whole
}> dang flamewar, and here's what I find:  DT was actually rather polite
}> until the flaming had gone on for a couple days, and then stooped so
}> low as to call -you- a gimp and a loser, but not for topposting!  
}He actually didn't post for 2 days.  

True, by which time you'd -earned- those gimp and loser titles.  Enjoy 
them!

}> No,
}> that was because you lied about groups on your list being topposted.
}I have not lied .. no one has put up a set of statistics to shoot it
}down as a lie.

First set of statistics:
http://tinyurl.com/3as2m

It was just a list of newsgroups.  Those who checked whether they were, in 
general, top posting newsgroups, found you to be full of shit.  Including 
myself.  beagle called you on it here: http://tinyurl.com/2csxn .

}Some have visited the groups and posted their opinions
}not statistics.  

A specific statistical test of one of the groups on your list was done 
here:
http://tinyurl.com/32l8v

Having shown that -one- of your claims was an outright lie, do you really 
expect us to go check the others?

}Some even supported me by saying they were top posting
}groups, Wharf Rat is one that comes to mind and I am sure there were
}others.

the wharf rat is not 'some', he is 'one'.  And he posted an opinion, not a 
statistic, so it looks like, by your ruler, he doesn't count, does he?

}> bizbee was abrasive, but not massively impolite, amazingly enough.
}> (at least, judging by the quotes X-no-archive leaves behind) He did

}Sisson in his abuse.

Funny, that.

}> Ben was downright nasty to you.  But was he
}> downright nasty to you for  top posting? or even defending top
}> posters?  No... Ben's first ire toward you was raised by this:
}> From the shadows, the mysterious "@ndrew" 
}> <andrewratinternodedotondotnet> (if that IS his real name) 
}> conspiratorially whispered: 
}> > No point talking to Biz mate .. he is an anonymous poster ever
}> > since I busted him with his feeble attempts on other newsgroups. 
}> You see?  It's not that you defended top posts, it's that you took a 
}> gratuitous potshot at bizbee.  And what's more, you made a completely 
}> non-credible claim that you had in some way 'busted' him, and that
}> his attempts were 'feeble'.
}Gratuitous? ... true is the word.

You're right, it's entirely true that it was a gratuitous pot shot.

}> So here we have it, @ndrew.  You picked a fight with four popular
}> posters over a nonexistent issue, got flamed to bits without
}> particularly abusive language, and then moved on to cry about it for
}> three whole months.  I'm sure you must be swelling with pride over
}> this.  Congrats!
}I return to my first answer in this post.  Why are Sisson, Bizbee and
}DarkTyger considered to be popular in this group.
}How and why does this group consider any of these three to be "popular"?

Answered above.

}They invariably have
}nothing to contribute except vitriol.  

See Ben's recent post about raid progression.
That's the most obvious example.  DT and biz also make many, many useful 
posts that I'm too lazy to dig up for you.

}> Congratulations.  Perhaps this whole flamewar could have been avoided
}> if you'd been polite to Lance in the first place, rather than
}> dredging up some ancient grudge against bizbee.
}I do not believe I was rude to Lance wouldn't even call it a flame
}really. The whole lot of flames came after I posted my list of
}newsgroups not after this post.

You called him (and some others) 'little boys'.

}> I dunno how you work things in Oz, but here in
}> America, and most democracies I'm familiar with, there's a pretty
}> strict standard of "one man, one vote." Not, as you propose, "one
}> man, as many votes as he can stuff in the ballot box." 
}This is not a democracy it is newsnet ... if it was a democracy George
}Bush would have sent in the special forces to take out Bizbee, Sisson
}and Dark Tyger.

Well, that's assuming it was an American democracy, and GWB had finally 
given up on that stupid First Amendment thingy.  You're right, it's not a 
democracy, it's closer to an anarchic system.  In an anarchic system, the 
minority is much more likely to get beaten up.  Same rule applies.

}> *Shrug* at this point, please prove that -we- do this?  
}The one about Bizbee is illustrative of his abusive nature. which also
}extends to top posting

}> http://tinyurl.com/2bz9m
Funny, I just linked an example of bizbee specifically -not- flaming top 
posters, and wishing everyone would just shut up about top and bottom 
posting.  If you weren't so bilious toward him, you might have found 
sympathy for your arguments there.

}> And you claimed that it proved they were topposting newsgroups.  This
}> was shown by others analyzing the data not to be the case.  
}No one else posted data, or analised mine that I am aware of  .. I was
}the only one.

See Jim Muir's post, linked above.

}> }> You mean, like we totally thrashed Hal?  And how we ignored
}> Arquvan's }> top posting for at least 16 threads before I got bored
}> of looking?  }You want me to go to Google again to dig out some
}> Bizbee beauties?
}> Sure, why not?  
}> Please show me at least one incident of bizbee using 
}> vitriol and abuse against someone for top posting, before anyone else
}> has suggested to that person that top posting might not be such a
}> good idea.
}Hard call with his "no archive" but I have pointed out Dan Day's list
}above.

...which contained not a single incident of bizbee flaming someone for 
*top* *posting*.

}Bizbee adds nothing but abuse and vitriol to this newsgroup I am still
}amazed that you consider him to be popular (jaw is still dropped to the
}floor).  I am more amused by his target's response which is mostly in
}line with my thoughts on him.

Yes, you're right, in the recent thread about the black screen of death, 
he's done nothing but flame.</sarcasm>

}> So let's see it, eh?  Where did bizbee dump abuse and vitriol over
}> people for top posting?  And why do I doubt that it's far less than
}> the abuse, vitriol, and just downright bad manners you've shown over
}> the issue to date?
}Bad manners hmmm ... I think not vitriol against the abusers likely ..
}bad manners ... why because I defend my self from wrong slurs?

You have to prove the slurs are wrong, first.  You're not doing such a 
good job of that.  Calling Lance a 'little boy' for saying please was 
*clearly* bad manners.  Top posting in a newsgroup where the FAQ *clearly* 
suggests bottom posting is bad manners.  Not snipping, bad manners.  You 
have gotten better on these issues, but, to date, you have shown very bad 
manners, yes.

}> Unless it happens to be a bottom poster, who was clearly being
}> 'caned'.  I think perhaps your abuse detectors need a bit of
}> calibration, one way or another.  Either that, or you just need to
}> stop contradicting yourself so heinously!  Was a bottom poster being
}> caned?  Or is there not a word of abuse? 
}I pointed out in an answer above that the "bottom poster being caned"
}was the only one I had ever seen taken to task in these NGs.  Caning
}does not have to involve abuse.  In this particular post, if IIRC, the
}worst it came to was "who do you think you are telling where I can and
}cannot post" ... a cane in my view but not abusive.

So it must have been pleasureable caning then?  Was the poster into S&M?  
Caning, as you usd it, clearly implied abuse.  To then go on to say 'there 
was never any abuse in those groups' would mean either statement (a) is a 
lie, or statement (b) is a lie. You pick.

}> You see, this is another place where you've badly contradicted
}> yourself.  You say you do not remember doing this [defending top
}> posters].  Then, in the very same line, you say you said not to abuse
}> top posters and to leave them alone.  
}And if it had been a bottom poster getting caned I would have said the
}same thing.  My view is that there are bigger fish to fry in the sea.
}If you do not like seeing top posting kill-file Just like Annie does.
}Yes the onus is on the reader to do so but it is the reader's
}sensibilities that are offended .. simple solution .. kill file.

We aren't arguing about that anymore, we're arguing abot your poor habit 
of contradicting yourself.

}> These two things are a
}> contradiction.  That means that they can't both be true at the same
}> time in any logical, rational world.  
}Leave them alone and kill-file I think work together ... I find that
}totally logical if it fits.

Aye, they fit together to make a coherent *defense* of top posters, which 
*contradicts* your statement that you never defended them.  Plese do try 
to keep up.

}> You also rely heavily on a strategy of posting one thing, then when 
}> someone calls you on it, you post a statement that contradicts it,
}> but snip the prior comment, and say 'I never said that!', as if we're
}> all far too dense to remember what you just posted not 15 minutes
}> before.  
}Please tell me where I have backed down on any statements I have made
}apart from the one that Ben Sisson had switched off his achiving .. I
}apologised on that.

I never said you backed down, only that you change your story every post.

}> So which is it, @ndrew?  Pathological lair or complete gonzo bonkers 
}> nutcase?  Take your pick.  Take both!  They're cheap.
}Neither and "cheap shots" are the words.

Prove you're worthy of more expensive ammo.
