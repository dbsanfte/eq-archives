I shamelessly stole the term from another poster, but boy does it hold
true.

I've been playing EQ since Aug '99. Just hit my 5th year and I still
don't have a "main". I've got characters on at least 4 different
servers, and tried just about every race/class combo you can think of.
My "friends" have all come and gone. Most levelled up and have quit EQ
over the years, but I still "roll" along. Last month I was a dedicated
"Shaman", before that "Bard" was my true love, and before that.....

Maybe I'll try an Iksar Necro again...it's been a while since the last
time :-P

I don't think there is a cure. I'm doomed I tell you...doomed!!

:-)
