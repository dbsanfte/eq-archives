You can melee on a mount, but it will do you no good.

Mounts give a moderate speed bonus (really really expensive ones give 
impressive speed benefits) over long distances, but are actually worse 
than no speed boost at all over short distances, as they require you to 
accelerate and decelerate, and make turning difficult; you lose more 
time fiddling with movement than you spend moving, unless you can get up 
to speed and then keep moving at speed for a while to make up for that.

A good melee'er will frequently be adjusting his position in order to 
keep his target at the correct distance, facing, and angle; a mount 
makes that more difficult (not at all impossible, just a nuisance)

What is really great about mounts, though, is not the speed, but rather 
the fact that you are "sitting" on them insofar as meditation goes.  Any 
time you are stationary on a mount, its as though you are sitting down 
for meditation purposes, which is a fairly significant boost to mana per 
tic.

Sadly, this only applies if you aren't attacking in melee (you can -be- 
attacked, just as long as you don't hit back), so its useless for melee 
purposes.

Further, this only applies to mana regeneration, for hp regen, being on 
a horse is like standing at all times... significantly WORSE than sitting!

Also you should note that mounts work only outdoors, if you spend most 
of your time indoors, they are a complete waste of money (except perhaps 
for a very fast one, which could help you shave your travel time from 
one indoor area to the next)

For a caster who spends a lot of time outdoors, a mount is one of the 
very best ways to spend a few thousand plat (just the very cheapest one 
you can buy, as its the mana regen you are buying).  For anyone else, it 
strikes me as more a status symbol than anything practical, contrary to 
"real life" a mounted melee really doesn't have much advantage over one 
on foot.
