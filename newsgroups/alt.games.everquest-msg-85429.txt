I have to add that some trades CAN be very profittable.   Usually if you
have an item that is in high demand (JBB, ES arms, Fungi...) you can get
some pretty nice items as part of the deal.   This stems from the impatience
of the buyer wanting the Item NOW and not wanting to raise the full  cash
amount.   They no they are loosing money but are willing to do that for
instant gratification.  I consider it OK to require 1.5x the value I am
asking for if I have to take a trade rather than straight plat.   With
everyone scrambling for plat on my server, I have had no problems getting
this.  I also try and take trades that will resell fairly fast.  (FBSS,
ect.)
