Easier than what?  The answer to the question is "Yes, but. . ."

While you get the book and one of the pages from Moodoro by playing his card
game, the other comes off an NPC (Dylin Starshine?) in HH and it's a rather nasty
camp (not impossible, just unpleasant - get ready to say your prayers to
Sorebottom O'Boredom, God of Camping ;p). Six or seven hour spawn time (I forget
which), *always* camped, and often KS'ed. It's a nice item for PvP since it's no
drop; but to be honest, on a PvE server I'd rather have a charred guardian shield
(drops in SolA - 30ish dungeon - can be had relatively inexpensively, I've seen
them going for as low as 250 these days).  /shrug

OTOH, it's one of the few nice off hand wis items that can be had by soloing at
relatively low levels as long as you don't mind the camp for Dylin. . .
