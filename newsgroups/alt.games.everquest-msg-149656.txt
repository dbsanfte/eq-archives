I don't think he's starting a Monk.  If I recall his history on this group,
the Monk was one of his first serious characters.  Then he tried a Wizard,
and concluded that Wizards were the worst class in the game, and only a
total moron would play one past level 1, and every time someone would ask a
Wizard question, he'd jump in, telling them to switch to something else
before it is too late, etc.  Then he did his Warrior.

Then he, for some reason, tried the Wizard again, and figured out that
Wizards are fun. :-)
