A 3-yr old girl (not that it matters) goes hunting with her dad (strange
family).  She doesn't hunt, but she keeps him company.  He shoots and kills
a deer.

Coming home she sees her new brother getting a lot of attention.  She gets
the rifle (undoubtedly heavy, but she's determined) and kills her baby
brother.

Are you saying that she should be tried as an adult?  And assuming you're
pro-death penalty, she should be fried?

If you've changed your mind, feel free to change your answer.
