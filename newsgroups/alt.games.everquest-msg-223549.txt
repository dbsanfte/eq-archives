$20 is a lot if you never end up liking it.  It's a pittance if it
turns out to be your favorite game.  Ie, if you just want to try out
the game and see what it's like, the $9.95 trilogy works well but the
$15-$25 version with silly figurine and expansions you won't see for
half a year is a bit much.
