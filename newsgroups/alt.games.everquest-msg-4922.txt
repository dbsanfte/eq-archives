Hmmm I am someone who is neither crying nor moaning or even wishing 
you away.  Yet I still wonder when (if ever) you and your friends 
might actually discuss Everquest.  Truthfully, it doesn't matter to me 
personally if you ever do decide to open a discussion about the game 
rather than the ng.  But if you think that "walking" in and starting 
flame wars with a few "old timers" is akin to "taking over" the group, 
your not even close to right.  Most of the people who come here come 
here for specific answers to specific question and don't even see half 
the stuff you post, much less care.  (Don't feel slighted by that 
because the same goes for everyone else)
