Those gnolls are very good money, but the xp can be slow. Two other 
suggestions are Skyfire and, believe it or not, permafrost. The mobs up 
near the entry to VP in Skyfire are still almost all dark blue at 60 and 
are not hard to duo. (Watch out for the dispelling flying ones, though.) 
Back in the old world, the caves in permafrost under Vox's digs can be 
fun too, and still give xp IIRC. Been a while since I was there, though. 
I do know one wizard who finished his push to level 60 in those caves 
though, back in the day. In fact, I believe the insane bastard was 
actually trying to quad down there.
