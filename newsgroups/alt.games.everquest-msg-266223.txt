Sour grapes?  (Didn't we win a war of Independence from your country 
over 200 years ago?  We now elect our leaders.)

Anyway, I really can't understand people who say George Bush is a dummy. 
  Get real.  The man holds two Ivy League degrees.  Plus, based on his 
military aptitude tests, there is evidence that if anything, George W. 
Bush's IQ is higher than John Kerry's!

Tom Brokaw even referenced it in an interview with John Kerry.

Calling names makes you sound so mature.  And grinning that Bin Laden 
has not been brought to justice???  Man, wipe that smirk off your face. 
  Two-thirds of al Qaeda have been killed or captured.  You're backing 
the wrong horse here.
