Thanks for the information, everyone...to Ken, I should say that
Everquest Gold does have PoP...it has the original and all 4
expansions, plus a pewter figurine and 3 cloth maps.  It is an
excellent deal...if you like the game.

So I will probably at first just see if the store will buy it, since
it will have the CD-keys (and I will deactivate the game, of course). 
If not, I will see if I can put up a notice in their computer games
section.  And then I can always try eBay, although I would rather not.
 Or I could keep it and maybe when I have enough free time to play it
(in 2050, when I am retired) I can reactivate it.

Or if there's anyone in San Diego that wants the game (perhaps for a
separate account, or if you know someone who wants a new copy) I
certainly don't mind selling it to you.  Just e-mail me.  I guess I'll
charge $25.

Game on,

The Oneiromancer
