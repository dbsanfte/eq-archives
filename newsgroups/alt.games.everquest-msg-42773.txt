    Yes, I know. The above rogue is equipped with a Serrated Bone Dirk
mainhand and a Yak offhand. Those ratios didn't come from thin air. ;-)

    Now re-read what I've said. The rogue has a weaker main-hand weapon, a
weaker proc on his main-hand weapon, no appreciable skill difference in Dual
Wield (200 vs. 210, I believe) or other offensive skills that grant ATK. His
backstab has NO minimum at that point in time - he can, and does, frequently
land backstabs for 1 point of damage. Using my rogue's max BS as a guideline
I imagine the top backstab was in the 180 range. The ATK rating of Backstab
would be the same as a fatty warrior's ATK rating for Bash, his special
attack. Given what we know about doing median damage, I stand by the
original statement: the damage output of a pre-Evade rogue and a warrior,
both in the rear arc, was not substantially different.

    So why were mobs turning around so much on rogues? Again, I stated why.
A backstab attack has a ton of hate hardcoded into it. My rogue can whiff a
backstab and have the mob turn on her just from that attempt. So any rogue
pounding away from behind was going to generate a ton of hate regardless of
damage output.

    And turning off attack and backing up, but that defeats the point of
doing heightened damage. There's also fewer old-world mobs that have
proximity as *the* determining factor in aggro, unlike Velious.
