Actually, I'm all for banning privately owned vehicles in the Portland
downtown core altogether.  Visitors to Portland are amazed when they 
discover just how easy it is to get around downtown without a car(*).  It
helps that all the public transit downtown (in the areas bounded by I-5
and 405) is free

Of course, the fact that my vision prevents me from getting an unrestricted
license, and the fact that I live downtown and don't bother to own a car
have nothing to do with that :-P

* My new job is working with a CVB in Portland and I spend a significant
part of my time helping visitors find their way.
