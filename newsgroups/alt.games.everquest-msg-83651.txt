Not sure, I came from DAoC, it is unlikely I will ever go back to DAoC 
the game really is very limited in geographical scop. I played in 2 
realms. Additionallly it is not half so complicated so doesn't take so 
long to master which would appeal to some.

Out of interest I came over from DAoC with a whole group of players, 
some were returning to EQ others were new so I think you would be 
ringing the bell too early.
