According to lore he was an unkillable dragon, that all the other dragons
had imprisoned.  Graeme described the script pretty well.

To keep him unkillable, they gave him a couple million hit points, made him
resist all spells, and gave damage output that people weren't supposed to be
able to stand up to.  7000 x4 melee, death touches every few seconds.
(Instant death).    And no loot... why bother, since it will never die. : )

They beat him by pure brute force.  On Rallos Zek server the three biggest
guilds gathered all of thier people... well over 300.  Then they chain rezed
them using cleric epics.   Anyone attacked was instantly killed, but they
kept people clicking, and wore it down over 4 hours or so.    Manaburn AA
landed to, so they used that as well.
