About 15 minutes.  I was offered help by a Druid in /roleplay mode, while
asking for Invis against Undead from any Necro that wasn't busy. I guess he
was extremely high level, as he simply ran around the top, love tapped
everything and then pulled them away, killing several in the process (I
guess) as I never saw people bitching about him training them. I don't know
for sure, because I for damned sure didn't get anywhere near them again that
night. (LoL) Corpse retrieval was easy with the island empty, BTW =)

Man I've had alot of nice people help me in this game. I got ressurected
twice in an hour one night by the same cleric in Unrest... as a level 15.  I
never asked, but I didn't refuse when I saw the pop-up =)
