Ack .. sorry :) Was about to say that Wu's is pretty much some of the better
you can get at your level, 20 is low. The good stuff comes at 40/45+. Since
you don't want to pay much, I don't see much alternatives. There are some
items of interest to monks, but as far as I know, they all cost a few hundred
plat (azure sleeves?).
