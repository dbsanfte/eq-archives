37, IIRC.

I first went to PoD at 46 or so, at which time most of the tsetsian
flies where yellow, after having read a posting on EQDiva about that
great spot. However, having pulled a couple of flies I got the dreaded
uncharmable message, and quickly zoned out and forgot about it for a couple
of levels. Later on I've returned, however, and I've found that it's only
mobs that are higher level than me I can't charm - mobs that were yellow
and gave me a uncharmable message a level ago are now white and can be
charmed, with the level 39 charm. Now at 52 I can charm most diseased rats,
and when I get yellows or red adds (like swamp rats) and I have a moderate
size swarm going I just go through the lower level mobs, charm and target
the higher level ones and /pet attack instead of the usual target nearest,
takes a little frantic clicking but when all the lower level ones are gone,
the higher level mob is hurt enough that chanting them down doesn't take too
long.

I've seen a hard cap of 55 mentioned for the the 39 charm, however I'm not
sure where. If this is correct it will be useful for exp swarming until the
upgrade (if you're able to get it), however for CC (or added DPS, although I
don't usually charm in groups to avoid confusion) in grouping situations
it'll get inadequate long before that, I'm afraid.
