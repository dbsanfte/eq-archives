Not our warriors.  :)
Generally, most of the super items are usable by both warriors and
paladins/sks (among others--have I mentioned I much I enjoy making
loot calls on All/All super items).  However, there are enough items
in the game which are specific to warrior or at least not usable by
paladin/sks that gives the warrior the edge.

If you gave a warrior and sk/paladin the exact same items to boost
their AC, the existence of cloak of thorns alone would negate that
argument.

But then at the endgame, /disc defensive gives the warrior the
equivalent of about +300 AC right off the bat.

Yep.
Stupid that a weapon has more AC than a BP.
