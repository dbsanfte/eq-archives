Bards are an easy class to play, but a difficult class to play well.

Are you taking into account - lag (usually the main problem) and possibly other
factors -their skill aren't high enough (missed notes),  or low dexterity, or
perhaps they are just plain new to the class and still learning the timing of
it (what lvl are you/they in the groups?). 

But admittedly getting just 3 songs to twist is pretty reasonable to expect.

Ask what songs they are singing, perhaps they are using self only buff songs so
you don't see the icon. Try giving them pointers on which songs they should be
singing or (worst case scenario)  just ask for 2 songs - everybody should be
able to manage that.  

Also ask if they've bothered practicing their skills for awhile. You now need
to equip an instrument for that skill to improve, perhaps they missed that
patch message saying it had been repaired and are still playing it the other
way and wondering why they've had no skill ups in a couple of lvls.

Either way give them a couple of pulls to get it right and change their tactics
and if they still cant manage it I'd start looking for a replacement.

Don't think of it as being outnumbered,
think of it as unlimited target selection.
