Acetone (nail polish remover) or Rubbing alcohol (80%)...a clean white
t-shirt (to cut up for cleaning pads...cotton balls leave "hairs"
behind)...Q-tips..and patience
 
If you over-did the thermal paste you may cause problems besides heat.
Some pastes are conductive. If you slop then across the Lx bridges and
other components around the CPU (the small chip in the center) you may
have micro-shorts.

Once you get the thermal paste solution resolved...or even before..

1. Go into the system bios and check the Hardware Monitor. It should
show current CPU temps, fan speeds, and line voltages. This will tell
you if you have an overheat problem. You want to see 35-48c at idle
with decent cooling.

2. Underclock the CPU if the system will let you. Set the bus speed to
100/100 (CPU/Memory). If the problem is heat related underclocking
should give you an idea. Less heat and stress on the system will be
generated and you should be able to boot farther and run more apps. If
the problem is bad memory....some memory will run fine at 100, but not
at 133.
