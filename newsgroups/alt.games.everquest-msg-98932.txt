The mechanism already exists, and very few people use it.
/lfg on|off

When we are looking for more, I do a / LFG first
then a / lfg level1 level2 all next.

Then I look for a suitable class nearby and
send a tell asking if they're interested.

The other day / lfg 50 60 all returned 16 hits.
I *KNOW* there were more than that looking for 
groups.
