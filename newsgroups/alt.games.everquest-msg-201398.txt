Newly-60 enchanter on Brell here.  Cash trades don't show up in my
logs, and I don't pay much attention to who gives what, but I'd say
the most common donation is around 30p, with a relatively gradual
curve from 10 to 50.  When they donate, the youngsters tend to give
between 1 and 5p. I've gotten a few 100+p donations, and an offer of a
k to go C3/haste a group in BoT.
