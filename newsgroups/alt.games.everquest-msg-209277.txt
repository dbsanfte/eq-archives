I'm pretty sure I read it first here.  And in my experience (which
admitedly doesn't count for all that much, I've never parsed for
the skill-ups so it's just observations of 10 or 12 characters with
no solid documentation) it seems to be true (keyword there: seems).
Just as keeping DEX at 100+ seems to be very helpful with offensive
melee skills.
