Doesn't seem that way to me; I'd say quite the opposite, that people 
cared vehemetly about their choices in this election.  The largest 
number of people ever voted in this election.  When the two parties are 
similar, why bother voting at all?  I'd expect a low turnout, which is 
what we saw back in 2000.

My point about people crossing the line is that these were people who 
were flexible about who they voted for... and yet they -still- didn't 
vote for Nader.

Aha, then you are in favor of allowing gays to marry, you just aren't in 
favor of requiring every religion to perform the ceremony.

See, by making it illegal for gays to marry, you are taking the choice 
-away- from the churches.

There are apparantly any number of pastors et al willing to perform the 
ceremonies,  but the question is, can they get a licence from their 
local city hall?  Will the marriage be recognized by the state?  How 
about the Federal Government?  How about by other states?  Clinton 
(often thought of as the Antichrist by hard core religious right 
adherants) made it legal for one state to refuse to recognize gay 
marrriages performed in other states, so that one has already been 
decided, unless someone repeals it.  So no, your idea that its a matter 
between the pastor and the couple isn't being honored.

And since City Hall will actually perform marriage ceremonies for mixed 
sex couples (via justice of the peace or what have you), the idea that 
this is a strictly religious matter is specious anyway.  Look at the 
hubub caused by the civil marriage people who have actually done so in 
the country, if you want to see that this actually seems to bug people

I'd be perfectly happy to forbid civil marriage to gays if you'd forbid 
it to straights; make a civil union the only thing government cares 
about, and tell people that Marriage is a purely religious/private 
matter that the government refuses to meddle with.

I was married as far as the State of Texas is concerned for 3 years 
before I got a license and had a pastor do a ceremony (because he was a 
friend, not because he was from my wifes religion, and I myself am an 
atheist more or less, so that certainly wouldn't apply.  He was fairly 
understanding about that sort of thing, which is, I imagine, part of why 
he's a friend.)

But then I'd put the ball back in your court; why would the government 
want to preclude civil union between gays and not between straights?
