How is Kitty Kat a phrase???  Which is the verb and which is the noun???
How is the verb "to Kat" conjugated???  Inquiring English Majors need to

personal preference.

: except it <is> really a phrase (c'mon, "not really a phrase??? Is that
: like "kind of pregnant" or "sort of dead"?)... and falls into the same
: category as names like Ubashem Ihealu, Stillborne Fetus, and Abadas

: As for Darkhawke, Verant stated that it is more lax with surnames as
: long as they don't complete phrases... but in reality it's more like
: someone named "Ima Darkhawke."
