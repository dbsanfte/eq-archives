Oh, I'm perfectly aware that France and Russia's position is motivated 
by their present oil deals, same as the UK and the US's actions are 
motivated by their future oil deals with the new administration they set 
up. But how's France's lack of support in the UN "hanging you out to 
dry", when it was apparent to all from the very first moment (as it has 
indeed turned out) that UN support would be nothing but a completely 
unnecessary formality? It's not like you were asking France to send 
troops in...

And that *is* exactly what I mean... Why do you take any disagreement, 
any indication that a country may have (God forbid!) interests different 
than those of the US as hatred and resentment? Here's a newsflash from 
reality: Outside certain islamic fundamentalists, nobody on this side of 
the Atlantic *hates* the US. Not even now under GWB. Capisce? We will 
still be glued to the Oscars come sunday night, we will still eat at 
McDonalds, we will still buy Leatherman tools, and we'll still travel to 
California if given half a chance. Disagreement will always happen, even 
under the new "One World Under One Superpower" regime, but that doesn't 
meant that people hate you. The support you saw after 9/11 was *genuine*, 
but that does not mean that the US will have everybody's support when it 
comes to bombing the shit out of a crushed, defeated regime (even if 
nobody likes said regime) to replace it with one more amenable to US 
economic interests.

Of course, I don't really expect that to get through the paranoid cocoon 
that many Americans appear to have spun around themselves these days...
