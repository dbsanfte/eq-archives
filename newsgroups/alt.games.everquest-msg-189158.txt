It seems to me that all you are doing is blaming people for how you r there
is nothing wrong with who you r, you just need to become comfortable with
it.
what do u meen your mother worships satan is she actually a satan
worshiperor do u just not get on with her
It seems to me that u need to leave home not because of ur mother because u
have to become comfortable with who u r.
God is not going to magically make ur life better u have to work at doing
that its a hard road but its one with happiness at the end of it.
sitting around and feeling sorry for yourself isn't gonna help you with ur
problems or make u feel better.
so u need to stop sitting on your backside and be a real christian help
people help yourself
let those who r without sin cast the first stone.
