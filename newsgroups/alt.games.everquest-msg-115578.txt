I totally agree. If someone says "porting for donations" and you offer them
5 gold... they should take it and port you. It was a donation, they allowed
you to determine the price for the port.

This is why I never port (or do anything) for donation... If I have free
time and I'm not doing anything... it is free. If I am trying to do
something else and you are taking time from me, it's 10p. If you want to
offer more as an incentive that I can weigh against the time I wanted to do
something else... bonus for us both.

Also, when I was a small druid, people would ask me to port them to
dangerous places.. IC, GD, Skyfire and even EJ have wandering mobs that can
make a real hassle for a younger druid. For those places I asked for 20p, to
balance my risk. I zone faster than anyone else I've ever met. Popping into
Skyfire alone and having a couple of the 45+ mobs there start beating on you
isn't fun.
