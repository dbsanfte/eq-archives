Actually, when they switched to sending percentage, that didn't stop
verification of numbers, because it still sent the total XP as part of the
initial data when you zoned.  So, people continued to figure out thing by
simply zoning whenever they wanted to see the exact current XP.  I don't
know if they have since changed that or not.
