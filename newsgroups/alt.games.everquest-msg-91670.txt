 Yeah because as we all know you should really not invite extra baggage
along. Even if they happen to be your guildmembers who would like to be
involved in some of the end-game encounters.  Not to mention encounters
that exceed the duration of Defensive along with the possibility of adds
(or your two warriors dying). Mobs that Rampage are always fun too
especially if you don't like your casters very much. 

 Sorry, this subject just bugs me. Raids shouldn't consist of just the
minimal amount of specific classes to get the job done. They are guild
activities and unless you happen to have 100+ members online at any one
time there shouldn't be a need to exclude anyone or make them feel like
baggage or dead weight.
