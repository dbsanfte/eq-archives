would still be fun, much easier now than it used to be for reasons that 
will make no sense to you.
If you're going to start, check out some of the websites, most notably 
everquest.allakhazam.com and eqatlas.com and eq.castersrealm for some of 
the info that is needed to really get going.  Alla's site has quest info 
including the new 'newbie armors'.  Go to castersrealm and figure out 
what race and class you wanna be, then go to alla's and look up the 
quests for the hometown of that race and class.  Vahshir is not a 
recommended race for a newbie.  Buy some ink for your printer and print 
out maps from Eqatlas for the newbie area for whereever you are starting 
and all the zones that directly connect to that area and the next 
connection too.  You'll know what zones you need to print out once you 
get started.  I still get lost even with the maps.
