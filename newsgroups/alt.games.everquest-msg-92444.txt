- DO AS MUCH DYING AS YOU CAN BEFORE LEVEL 5 AND RUN NAKED IF YOU CAN
BEFORE LEVEL 5. When some Uber(tm) guy or gal hands you a great
looking uber widget, don't take it on your suicide mission before
level 5. Your body rots faster because it is tender before level 5.
The items will rot with it, and thats bad. Explore the world and mess
up real bad while you are young!

- EXPERIMENT. Try it just the way we tell you not to with an alt.
(Except for the begging part) Try a different race, class or starting
city. Delete them if you hate the class/race choice and start over. If
people tell you zone XYZ is a deathtrap, go there with disposable
items and see it. If you don't get your corpse back so what? Its only
bits in the big bit bucket in the sky!

- PLEASE DON'T ACT LIKE YOU LEARNED TO DRIVE IN MIAMI. I learned to
drive in Miami, where the slightest infraction of courtesy results in
shouting in a lot of different languages, hand gestures of a wide
variety, and (sometimes)shooting. EQ is a lot like Miami, there are a
lot of people there from somewhere else, who may or may not understand
your activities. When someone is really getting mad in a zone I
sometimes type "QUE?" and they usually are to stunned to be mad.
