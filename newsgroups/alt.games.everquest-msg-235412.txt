I tried that, and it didn't seem to quite work as advertised,
but I did find that shift-rightclick would itself open to the
old UI, giving me access to the stored items.

Also, if you open the new UI by mistake, just click on the
"experiment" button to get the old UI, again revealing any
stored items.

In any case, the short answer is the items are not lost.

One experiment I have not yet tried is, suppose I do have some
items stored in my sewing kit.  Can I open the new UI and use
the sewing kit, or do I have to remove the stored stuff first?
Worse yet, if I try to use the new UI, does it add the selected
items from inventory into the container and then attempt the
combine?  E.g., if I had a single silk thread in my sewing kit
and asked the new UI to create a silk bandage (uses 2 threads),
would it instead create a silk cord (uses 3 threads)?

Enquiring minds want to know!
