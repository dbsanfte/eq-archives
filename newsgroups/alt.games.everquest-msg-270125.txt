Well, they wouldn't have to be all the same, either.  One orc king
could be a warrior, the next might be an enchanter.  It doesn't take
a lot of variation to give the impression of a changing world.

One problem I haven't seen mentioned in this thread is that some
people clearly LIKE at least one element of a static world: the
ability to refer to the accumulated wisdom of earlier players.
If the world truly changes over time, then all the walkthroughs
for quests and mob kills etc. become useless as that content gets
overwritten by changes to the world.

There are also benefits to knowing that parts of the world are
static and self-replenishing.  So you killed mob X who dropped
An Oddly Shaped Eggplant and you tossed it because you had no
idea what it's for?  (And don't tell me you have the bank space
to save all the weird items that drop!)  And later you run across
a quest calling for that eggplant, so you go back and kill mob X
again to get it.  Imagine how screwed you'd be if you could never
face mob X again.

Recently I wanted to collect some acrylia for tailoring practice,
and I had a character at the right level for fighting Grimlings in
Hollowshade.  I arrived in the Grimling town just as a high-level
character was killing their defenders so that the owlbears or
wolves could take over, tipping the Hollowshade War from a 3-way
balance to the shifting 2-vs-1 version, because he needed to farm
owlbears for Screaming Substance.  No biggie; he was there first,
so I found something else to do.  And some day the Grimlings will
be back; it's the advantage of the static world.

It might be a lot of fun to play, but it would be a nightmare to
administer.  Making sure that changes don't make other parts of the
game either trivial or impossible is hard enough as is (and doesn't
always succeed, as witness mudflation), but with changes being made
in real time I can't imagine how to coordinate it all.  "What? You
just dropped a meteor on Freeport? But I just added a quest in
Kelethin sending people there!"

Frankly, though I recognise that the static world can be a problem,
I'd probably be happy just to have them maintain the illusion of
change long enough so that it doesn't break immersion.  If I kill
Crush, and the next day come back and kill him again, that's my
choice; I didn't have to come back and see he's returned.  There's
lot of other stuff I could do if I really want to avoid seeing
proof that I haven't changed the world.  But the other night I got
my Shackle of Steel, which involves giving a key to an Iksar slave
in FM (used to be in Nurga).  The slave thanked me, gave me the
reward, and vanished.  (Sure, it would be better to have him run
away, but I won't quibble about that.)  Then, before I could even
close my inventory window and turn to leave, he respawned.  It's
not as though people are lined up around the block for this quest;
they could afford to have a few minutes on his respawn timer.
(I actually /bugged that one.)  Anyway, my point is that even if
they just made it so that the world stays changed long enough for
me to leave, so it's my decision whether I come back and see that
it's changed back, I think that would help a surprising amount.
