Nothing is KoS on the moon the NPC's.  There are a lot of hostile MoB's
though that you should watch out for they are tough mothas.  One group of
NPC's you may need to watch out for are in Marus Seru and the Netherbenian
Lair they are called Hand of Seru.  I hear they are KoS to dark races and
classes but my Dark Elf Sk walked right past 'em without being touched.  I
was dubious to them surprisingly enough.  Just watch out if you are bringing
a tough MoB past them because they won't help you, so keep on running and
hit the zoneline.  That's all the advice I can give you about Luclin for
now, it is all I have learned as of yet.  Have Fun!
