If you were to look for an artist to commission to draw your character for
you, would the inability to pay with a credit card (ala paypal) be a
serious deterent for you?  If so, would it be a deterent for security
reasons (ie, you have no assurance that they wouldn't take your money and
run, other than their own rep) or more just that you might not have cash
to burn?
