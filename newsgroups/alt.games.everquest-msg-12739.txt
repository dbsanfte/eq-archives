wot is this FD trick u are describing please?
some other guy in the game said i have to do the following (which I didnt
understand at all, so he called me a lamer?):

FD, repeatedly turn off the FD buff icon (we dont get an icon????), then FD
again. do this 4 times to get off the mobs agro list.

i didnt understand. dont you FD, if successful just stay there? why would
you want to get up/turn it off?
now, this guy was a 51 Necro and did seem to know what he was talking about

im having trouble with FD, it doesn't seem to always work? (especially on
casters) are there any tricks i need to know about please?
some other person said dont fire FD as the mob is casting. Is this right?
How do i know if the mob is casting?
