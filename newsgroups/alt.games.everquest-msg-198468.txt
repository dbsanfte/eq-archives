I tried to get back the excitement I felt when I first started playing by
leveling up some new characters - no PLing and no twinking.  The highest
I've gotten a character is level 14.  For me, it's not the repitition as
much as the downtime.  Maybe all characters should start with a choice of
Fungi Tunic or Staff of KEI. ;)
