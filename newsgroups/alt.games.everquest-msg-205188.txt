The level 50 shaman spell seems to be a fairly rare drop Velious
era thing.   (hey, you know the game went to 50 back before ROK,
are you telling me there's not -one- spell at 50 from the
original game?  What weird game design!)

EQcastersrealm says its a pet only buff that costs 50 mana and:

Increase STR by 30
Increase AC by 19 (L50) to 21 (L65)
Increase Attack Speed by 20%

Then there's a lot of discussion about what a piece of trash this
spell is, interspersed with some claims that it isn't; nothing
conclusive in 8 pages of posts.

If it doesn't stack with other spells, I think I have to agree
with the majority of posters, I can give my pet 40% haste instead
of this lame 20% one, and increase his STR by 67 instead of 30
while giving him 250 hp and 50 dex with HOS, which will last for
over an hour instead of 6 minutes.

If, on the other hand it -does- stack, particularly if the haste
part stacks, then I'll go start camping it immediately; my pet's
damage output with just Alacrity is already high enough that
whenever I get two identical mobs and we each take one, his dies
before mine gets down to 50% health.  I try to explain that this
is because I have to cast the DOTs and slows and so forth but he
just laughs at me and suddenly my mob is dropping dead too.  So
half again the haste?  Sign me up.

Its hard to tell in what ways various spells effects stack,
sometimes the effects stack and sometimes you get both buff icons
but only the best of the spells effects.  If one doesn't bounce,
its difficult to say whats going on.  In the case of pets, its
even -more- difficult, because you can't just check your stats to
see if they go up again when the second spell hits.

I guess the only thing to do would be log a fight with the pet
damage turned on and parse it.  Presumably haste would be easy to
detect just by looking at the timing of each blow or miss; the
str boost would be harder to pick up but should show as a slight
increase in average damage?

Speaking of which, has anyone checked to see to what extent stat
boosting pets has any effect on their damage output?  I can
easily give 67 str to a pet, if I get IOS I can get that to 106,
and if this stacks with both IOS and Strength I could get to 136
str boost.  Does that translate to 1% more damage?  10% more?

Maybe I should hunt up a log parser and start playing with these
questions myself, if the work hasn't already been done for me
somewhere.

Paax, 50 shaman, Morel Thule
