By an insignificant value of "significant".

I suppose that depends on what kind of media you listen to. The whole 
point is that the people at the Waco compound ended up dead as doornails, 
and ultimately their arsenal amounted to all of fuck all.

When people, unarmed, took to the streets in the Soviet Union, the 
government fell. In Germany, the population never rebelled against the 
Nazi regime; in fact, the Nazis remained popular until the very last 
stages of the war. In China... Well, if you are talking about Tiananmen 
Square, that was a demonstration, not a rebellion; there never was any 
intention to bring down the government.

Face it... The idea of the plucky farmer taking potshots with his AK-47 
at the evil ATF black helicopters may be a satisfying fantasy, but it's 
just that.
