OK, boots, you can probably do with a partner.  You're about the right 
level to still get exp camping the Firewalker Boots in SolA, and there are 
several other class-armor drops in the area.
Greaves will require a partner at least.  You can probably get the guk 
drop just doing zone-in to lower guk, or loot them off a mob that a higher 
leverl person kills.  The goblin greaves are tougher, but a small group 
can do it.
The BP is going to be tough for you, just because the Gypsy Lute drops in 
a basically uncamped dungeon.  The gargoyle drop is common, and you can 
get it camping the BR or the ASS/SUP if you have a decent group.  You're 
not gonna solo either of these anytime soon.
Vambraces are another fairly tough one, though you could probably get the 
Sol A drop solo, if you're lucky.  Again, grab a partner.
The bracers and Gauntlets you can probably solo, though you may have a bit 
of trouble getting the drop in Mistmoore.
The helm was the hardest to get for me, and is not going to be soloable 
until you get to 37 or so.  
Any of the quest items (with the possible exception of Gypsy Lute) can be 
easily aquired by a group of mid-30s.  Only the outdoor pieces can be 
reasonably solo'ed by a mid-30s bard.  Hunting for my lambent quests was 
one of the highlights of my EQ career.  It's amazing how many of the 
people in my lambent hunt screenshots are good friends and guildies well 
over 2 years later.  I just wish I had taken more than random screenshots.

A three-song twist is perfectly acceptable on raids.  I've heard of some 
raids preferring a two-song twist, but I suspect they just have lazy 
bards.  With the new AE FR/CR, AE PR/DR, and AE mana songs, we're finding 
that there are more bards than songs on some big raids.  That means we get 
to sing stuff like Warcry of the Vahshir and add 25% haste to melee, over 
the cap.  Allowed a warrior/sk heavy group to KS the first 20 or so kills 
on most recent ToV run, over the wizards, rogues, and rangers.

Aye, amplification is a great song.  I'm lazy though, and ever since I got 
the upgraded Cantata at 55, I've resisted twisting manasongs during 
downtime.  Now that I have the AE manasong I will twist a bit, just so 
that my group knows I love them more than the rest of the raid.  (Of 
course this assumes I'm in the buffing groups, though with MGB, it's not 
that critical now.)
