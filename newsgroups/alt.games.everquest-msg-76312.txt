It annoys me, but it's usually a sign of something much deeper. You
can change the name, but it's still not going to make Hulk Asshammer,
Pimpachu Stabjoo, or Dingussx Pooppirate into anything other than the
losers they are.

Of course, this extends into real life as well. My friend's last idiot
boyfriend insisted on calling himself "Sauron" and got very upset with
people who refused to call him that. Even if he'd been a genuine
badass, it would have been hard to pull off. But, he's a short,
balding, Jewish kid, approaching 30 who refuses to let go of his
dreams of goth metal stardom.

My feeling with taking copyrighted names from fiction is more along
the lines of, "Hey! You're not Drizzt Do'Urden. Either you're:

A. A newbie, who hasn't earned the name.
B. Sufficiently powerful that you should be making a name for
yourself.
