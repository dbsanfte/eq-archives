	Actually jumping into that hole in Paineel originally zoned you back out
to Tox.  The real surprise was after they opened the Hole: after that, jumping
into the hole in Paineel a) zoned you into the Hole, b) stripped any spells
with lev effects, and c) just in case you survived the fall (not likely),
dropped you in front of Master Yael.

	While Vox was a Cleric from Day One, the ability to summon didn't come
until much later.  People were using a variety of standoff tactics to kill the
Dragons (like six Mages killing Naggy by standing outside his room and sending
in pets), so they were given the ability to summon PCs on their hate lists.
This ability was (IMO improperly) given to all mobs of L50 or better.
