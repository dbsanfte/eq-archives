replace with Deepwater no later than L45 when you can use the
click effect as a mana free "buff heal" (slow cast but still
much more efficient than medding to cast a heal).

Replace these with ac/hp rings.  Jagged Bands (5ac 3str) at very
minumum if you are poor (should be <= 30pp each), Xx Fire Wedding
Rings prefered.  Alternative for one ring:  Fine Antique Ring (PoK
quest), less ac/hp, but it has Mana Preservation 2 which will save
you 10% of the mana cost for each L44 or below spell you cast.

>       serpentine bracer


Ack!  Replace with almost anything, even Banded is better!  Hero
Bracers if you can wear (if you're a Dwarf you can't), Bracer of
Ro, Scavenger's Bracer, the ac11 blue chain bracers from JP gnolls,
Fineplate, anything!


>       lightcrawler vambraces
>       dark mail gauntlets


Check bazaar price on Gauntlets of the Black and Silver Chitin
Handwraps (haste item, see comments on belt below).


>       adamantite epaulets


Crested Spaulders are ac11 6sta, you need ac and hp/sta far more
than you need wis.


>       netherbian chitin


Upgrades are expensive, watch for Acrylia BP in size you can wear
and get a feel for the price so you can be ready to buy a cheap
one if you see it when you've got pp in the bank.


>       cloak of the rygorr oracles


Go for ac/hp.  CLoak of the Ice Bear much cheaper than this, for
example.  Watch for and get feel for price of White Bear Pelt
Cloak (ac11 75hp other stats too).

>       crystalline belt


You have no Haste item, you are a melee, Haste is your very best
friend.  The best bang for the buck haste is gonna be either
the Flowing Black Silk Sash (waist) or Silver Chitin Handwraps.
Either will cost around 2k (FBSS should be a little under, SCHW
usually a little over).  Compare cost and stats of glove/belt
combos, save your pennies, and try to get a good deal.


>       small bronze greaves


The only piece of Ro armor that's actually worth the enchanted platinum
bars is the greaves.  Look for 'em, try to buy for 200 or less, or do
the quest (will cost 210+ to quest).  Better alternatives are usually
quite a bit more expensive (hard to find decent legs at a good price).


>       cotrie general boots


Shop the Bazaar, watch for deals on good boots (Dusty Soriz or better).


>       Arbitors combine greatsword

This is quite decent for your level, especially if you get Haste.

As you near 50 there are some recommended level restricted blades
that will start to look very attractive.

You don't mention a neck, Ry`Gorr or better would serve you well.
I don't see a face either, Fineplate Visor is an inexpensive one
with decent AC.

You need AC and HP (STA gives you 3 HP per at L39) more than anything
else (except item Haste).  In time you will need resist gear, but first
focus on AC while keeping an eye out for +HP (and +STA) gear.  And get
a Haste item (but not a crappy one like Sporali Gloves or Flowing Red
Silk Sash, nothing worse than the 16% of a Swirlspine Belt).  To check
the value of item Haste you can look item up on Lucy and check the
Effect Level, that +1 is percent Haste.

Also, it helps a lot to spend some time occasionally shopping the
bazaar.  Search by Slot/ArmorClass/Class/Race, sort by Armor Class,
and see what's out there and what the "usual" price is so you can
spot a deal when it comes up (helps to have pp in the bank).  You
can make some pp grouping in LGuk (have weight refucing bag(s) to
carry that heavy finesteel out for selling to vendors), a decent
HG group in Rathe Mountains could net you 100pp / hour or more.
There are plenty of other places, you don't mention a guild or in-
game friends you spend time with, these can be great sources of
info and groupmates.  Paladin generally does better in a group than
solo (lots better if the group is good).

hth,
