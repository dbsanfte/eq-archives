RFC1855, Netiquette Guidelines, section 3.0. I quote:

 "If you are sending a reply to a message or a posting be sure you
  summarize the original at the top of the message, or include just
  enough text of the original to give a context. This will make sure
  readers understand when they start to read your response. Since
  NetNews, especially, is proliferated by distributing the postings
  from one host to another, it is possible to see a response to a
  message before seeing the original. Giving context helps everyone.
  But do not include the entire original!"
