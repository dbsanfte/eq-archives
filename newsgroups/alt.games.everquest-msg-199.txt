Actually, I believe one of the problems was that Verant did not get a
look at the guides beforehand, for the original guides.  Verant still
deserves full blame for the mistakes in the guide, of course, because
Verant did designate them as the offical guides, but what Verant needs
blaming for is incredible stupidity, rather than lying, in that case.
One of the big improvements they made in later guides was having Verant
go over them before they were released.

In the specific case of the XP bonus for humans, it is much simpler, and
probably would not have been fixed even if Verant had reviewed the
guide, because the best theory I've heard is that the XP thing is just a
bug.  Someone put the human XP table, with the bonus, on the wrong race,
and it was not discovered until too late, so they left it.  Note that
because the XP distribution system in groups is designed to keep people
leveling at the same rate, that halflings got the bonus instead of
humans would not really stand out.  Until you packet sniff with ShowEQ,
it takes some careful record keeping and experiments to demonstrate the
error.  (Now it is easy, even without ShowEQ, because we know how the XP
system works...remember that back then, just counting how many level 1
bats it took to level was not conclusive, because we didn't necessarily
know that mob level in a given zone was the only factor in the amount of
XP that mob gave).
