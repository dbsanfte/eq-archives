I tried out my bard today, I haven't played her for a bit so ..... I log her
in and play her a bit.  I got her very close to 30, so I thought I would hit
my favorite bard site http://www.eqdiva.com and I see a very interesting
message (see below).

      I do not want to display this page
      The bard site you are looking for is currently unavailable. Kocho
Divah might be experiencing emotional difficulties, as she has decided to
temporarily take it down while she figures things out.

I am wondering, how long has the site been down?

Thanks,

Shuacat
