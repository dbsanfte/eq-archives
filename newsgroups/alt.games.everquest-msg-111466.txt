    Players selling an account aren't selling the little bits of information
sitting on Sony's computer, though. They're selling knowledge of the
password. The password to the account is what has value, and that value is
derived from the pixels sitting in the account. Saying "we own the pixels"
isn't good enough.

    The closest analogy I can think of (DANGER! ANALOGY! DANGER!) would be
my dealership leasing (without a buyout clause) a vehicle to someone who
then used it as a taxi. The vehicle is the property of the dealership, but
the dealership can't stop the lessee from using the vehicle as a taxi (and
making profit from it) unless the dealership expressly forbids them from
doing so. Should the dealership do something to the vehicle after the lease
starts which makes the vehicle unable to be used as a taxi, the dealership
could be sued for financial loss.

    Item sales, I agree, are pretty much stopped by a "we own this" stance.
The problem with item sales is they're almost impossible to prove. :-)
