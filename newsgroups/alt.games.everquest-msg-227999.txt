Player reviews, Rumbledor.

Anyone who actually believes anything a gaming site says nowadays
deserves to be burned. Did Black & White teach people nothing?

The reviews of Horizons are mixed. It's not as bad as say..
shadowbane.. but its bringing nothing new to the table and has another
level grind on top of it, along with some (re)design decisions that
just boggle the mind. It's also not in fit condition for release yet,
with some rowdy bugs and a nasty billing problem that has people
calling their CC companies in panic. Finally its combat system - which
is the bread and butter of any mmorpg - is almost universally
considered to be the worst of any mmorpg released by far.

However some people like it. I'm not sure *why* they like it (some
just like it because they get to be a dragon, others because they are
tradeskill freaks) but there are always those who do.
