Hi all.  Yes, I'm sure I'm late to the game on this, but tonight I ran
into some new mobs in Surefall Glade.  I found that the Bloodsaber
Defiler is some kind of necro, and is involved with a Druid quest
weapon (jaggedpine scimitar).  Never heard of her before now.

Well, I stumbled upon the Defiler tonight, but only after I ran into
the caves after a poacher.  As I wound my way around and started
beating on the poacher, some caster named Levitian (forgot last name)
started setting me on fire. I ignored him and chased the Poacher, who
ran right past the Defiler and she aggro'd me. Between her (conned
dark blue to me at lvl 17) and the Poacher, I had my work cut out for
me. Finally killed the Defiler, looted her head, and the Poacher came
back. So I beat on him some more, and this Levitian dude showed up
again and lit me up 1 more time. I was low on heath and had some of
the necro stuff still on me, so I zoned and healed up. 

Who is Levitian, and why does he not like me? :) 

Thanks.
