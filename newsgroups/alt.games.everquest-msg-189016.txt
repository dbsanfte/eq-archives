in the planes of power expansion enchanters have had a tremendous surge
of power compared to the last expansions. I dont think anyone is talking
about
nerfing the level 33 enchanters out there, its the level 65 planes of power
enchanters
that peopel think are unbalanced.

Yes, we know our charm will be nerfed again (affliction focus change
affected CoD in a huge way allready), and then probably again after that, we
can see it from a mile away.
But, if they do ever fix it and get it to a reasonable status, its gonna be
necros and bards that people are ragging on next.
