The Ranger's Glade has a list of the 20 new melee openings for rogues, and
some of those have short-term "tricks" such as I mentioned above.  
Debuffs of various things (fewer riposte, fewer double attack, lower ac,
etc on mob) were also big.  I"m guessing that the snare is something like
hamstringing a mob.

Unless it was a complete bunch of hooey cooked up by some bitter
rangers...not unlikely right now.  WE'll find out soon enough.
