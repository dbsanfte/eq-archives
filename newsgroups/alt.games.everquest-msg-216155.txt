However, *everybody* else here is discussing LDoN, so in this case you
should probably take that clue back and trade it in for one that illuminates
this fact for you.

Good, I didn't want your two shits...

Ahh, see, *now* you've changed the subject away from LDoN.  Probably should
have done that before making that silly statement above...

As far as your claim, it's totally irrelevant to anything, LDoN or
otherwise, until you give more information.  I don't even know whether you
are the bitchy paladin who thinks he can outpull the monk and then bores the
group to tears, or the tissue paper ranger who thinks he can outpull the
monk and then has to be rezzed half a dozen times, or the whiny warrior who
thinks hp mak gud puller!

But really, I don't dispute you too much on that, I just like to show that
I'm an equal opportunity offender.  :)  I'm the puller in groups and
raids because, well, that's what I do.  Not because I'm a monk.  I
specifically made my monk *to* give me the best possible setup to be the
puller.
