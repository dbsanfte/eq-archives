Only an example - maybe it was 29 or 34 or 39, but you get the point. ;=)
Actually, IIRC I was getting pretty good experience in the grasslands and KC
area of DL up to 49 or so - there are plenty of the orange brutes and higher
level Drolvargs wandering around.  Maybe some zones have supplanted it as
the best experience, but it was still pretty good.  It was at least a few
months ago, though.
