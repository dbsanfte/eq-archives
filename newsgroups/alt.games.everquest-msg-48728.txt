Maybe because it's a female troll? Actually, that female troll was one of the
better looking models IMO :) (No more triangular old Madonna bras!)

Human female might have been okay except for the huge butt... and what on
EARTH did they do with the dark elves? Are they all seasick or mutating into
green elves, and the new hair looks like very poorly done mock wigs - which
they probably are given the new hair colors... the only good thing about them
was the new sitting posture. My dark elf is a lithe, blueskinned, platinum
haired killing machine, not that green bodybuilder with a Conan wig.
And the ogres... maybe they're getting smarter, maybe not - but these look
like bald, fat Barbarians. They're *horrid*.

Another thing about these models is that they all seem more 'bland' colored
to me, they feel more like 3d color pencil drawings than the old ones. It
might be because I am used to the old models, it might be a lack of lighting,
but to me, the originals are more 'alive'.
