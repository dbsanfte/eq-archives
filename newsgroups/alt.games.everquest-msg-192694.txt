Are you selling this stuff in the bazaar or just selling it to any NPC
vendor?  What items are you selling?  The server player economy is going to
be a lot different on your server the others servers.  I can tell you that
server economy is very different from sever to server.  I play on both
Rodcet Nife and Solusek Ro and the prices of items in the bazaar are way out
of whack with each other. Items on Solusek are way more costly then the same
items on Rodcet, especially melee equipment.
