I did the exact same thing when I created my monk in Feb of 1999. I
put everything into strength (that was the common wisdom at the time).

I had no problems leveling up to 53 over the last couple of years (I
play casually) I do wish I had put the points into STA, but I don't
think it really slowed me down that much.
