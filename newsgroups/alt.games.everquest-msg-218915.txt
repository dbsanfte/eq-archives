This is a flaw seen all over EQ; I used to say "Verant trains us
Wrong", although nowadays its SOE.

Still, my point is that class defining abilities aren't available
at low levels, and other abilities may be present that aren't
available at higher levels, so that you are spending the
"learning" portions of the game actively learning how not to play
your character well.

At the same time, everyone gets in in their heads what various
other classes can and can't do, and they have to unlearn all that
at higher levels.

Take cleric melee for example.  Like all classes, its fine at the
extreme low end of the scale.  It lags down behind melee classes,
as is proper, but if you keep at it its still usable all the way
up to 44 or so.  Suddenly, instead of slowly falling behind due
to lower cap per level and lack of key bonus skills such as
double attack, dual weild, it dies, victim to a level cap on the
skill.  Then 12 levels later it gets ressurrected in spades; with
Yaulp V to make up for lost mana, a massive dex boost and a high
unresistable proc on the hammer, a cleric can outdamage poorly
equipped warriors his level.  Until around level 60, at which
point despite increasingly useful hammers his damage output just
isn't keeping up.

If they wanted clerics to be able to melee more, they'd add some
mana regen to all the yaulps (more and more as the yaulp got
higher) and retune the whole line of summoned hammers from the
lowest level on up; currently ONLY the ones level 56+ are useful
for anything but farming spiderlings.

Pets are another example; why do clerics not get a pet until
level 54, and never get another, so that they have an effective
pet for only the 54-60 range.  Shaman don't get their first pet
till 34, and its class altering when they finally do get it. 
Druids don't get their pet until 56, and its never useful. 
Wizards get the same pet as clerics, only at 58 where its only
useful for two levels, and they have a much better damage output
anyway so its not as good a use of mana in most circumstances as
the cleric one.

Why not give all these classes weaker versions of their pet from
level 9 on?  Either its an integral part of the class or its not!

Jolt, a critical ranger spell line that lets them finally reduce
the outrageous aggro they generate so they can go wild with
damage output without having to tank; they get this at what,
level 50?  Ridiculous, its a key class ability, they should have
it from level 9 or so on up, in a reduced form, but good enough
to get used to what it is and how it works, and to have it
available so they can play properly.

Shaman get slow from a relatively low level, enchanters get mez
from a low level... These are examples of what I'm talking about.

I could think of dozens more, it happens to all classes in all
levels of EQ I think.

The Vision at work, still?
