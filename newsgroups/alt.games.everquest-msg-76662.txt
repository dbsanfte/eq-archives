Oh holy shit. There are a lot of very pissed off shadow knights and Necros out
there that camped for this item right now. Oh well it was kind of powerful to have
a no mana, no casting time FD mask.

Sweet!

Does combat mean only when the auto-attack is on of the character?
Or if any member of the group is is in combat, heh. Because this would
still be useful for casters not having to hit the sit button to med and stand
to cast.

Ooo ouch I hope everyone hunting there reads the patch message. Heh.

I love how they continually add new cool and useful spells/abilities to the game and then
add zones where they don't work or monsters that are immune to them.

hehehe I like the "*should*" part.

Wow. That just made those skills much more useful. Does it this mean it
work while running to. =)
