Okay,

I don't like the idea of giving Bill and Co any more money than the next
guy, but.....

This weeks deals on XP and the free stuff retailers are throwing in is
REALLY tempting

Example

Best Buy
Buy XP (any version, so upgrade home is the cheapest) get One music CD Free,
Free Anti Virius software, Free 64MB Diamond Rio (49 out of pocket) and Free
PC133 RAM (128 for Home, 256 for Pro)

Office Max
Buy XP Pro upgrade online (but use the $60 off $350 for first time OfficeMax
buyers link from Techbargains.com) and get

256MB of RAM
A Web Cam
a 12x 10x 32x CDRW
and an HP USB scanner

After all the instant Rebates, you total is $205, and you still have a $50
rebate to go...

That is $500 worth of stuff for LESS than the initial price of the XP Pro
Upgrade.

I had to wonder WHY they were throwing in the kitchen sink with all this
stuff, and the only answer I can think of is to help get people in the store
and on XP. Get the word of mouth going.

Me? I share the same opinion as many others in the NG.

If you are running Win2k Pro. Skip XP. There are SOME reasons, but not many
to upgrade.

If you are on Win9x (Win 95, Win98, Win98SE, or WinME) Just upgrade. You
will NOT belive how much better XP is than Win9x.

As a testamonial for the Stablity of Win2k (the base of WinXP) In the nearly
two years I have run Win2k Pro, I can count the number of total system
lockups on one hand and still have fingers left over.

It's your choice, but hey, freebies are nice if you're going to upgrade
anyway.

Now if Verant would just make EQ for Mac OS X. MMmm EQ on a Cinema Display
yummy.
