Charm is not a fixed duration. It CAN last 8 minutes.. or break after
1. it just depends on your luck. And it always likes breaking at the
most annoying of times :>. Plus.. pooka's don't usually show up in
zone until after the golems.

It should still mess up the agro for the pet if you have 3 other
people on its list. As long as he's one of the 3.. yeah.. nice extra
damage.

Nice to have the two chanters, i've never had that luxury. On a break
of the pet the other can keep the primary at bay during recharm. The
odds of a double break are extremely low.
