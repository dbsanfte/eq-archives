Actually spells skills will go up on green mobs just fine. It's melee
skills etc that won't. I haven't seen a pickpocket skillup off one,
but I've heard tell that you can, even at 40. I know I've gotten
skillups off green mobs, but it takes ages, and I didn't have the
patience to try it on the soulbinder.
