Killing a human being is killing a human being.  Some human beings are
young, some human beings are old.  Some human beings are "good", some
human beings are "evil".  Some human beings are black, some human
beings are white.  Some human beings are female, some human beings are
male.

If you kill a human being, you kill a human being.  If you kill a
baby, you kill a human being.  If you kill a criminal, you kill a
human being.

Unless you're going to start arguing that criminals no longer qualify
as human beings, you're just plain wrong.  Trying to back me into a
corner by saying I consider killing a baby the same as killing a
criminal won't work, because I never said that.  However, there is no
denying the truth that killing a human being is, in fact, killing a
human being, whether that human being is a baby, or a criminal, or
something else entirely.

You made a valiant attempt at twisting my words, though.  Your
consistent intellectual dishonesty doesn't do you any favors.
