Making a CHARACTER "red name" on a non-zek server is a waste. You can
only attack other red name CHARACTERS, and you can only be
buffed/healed/teleported by other red name CHARACTERS.

Petition to have your pvp flag turned back off. Sometimes the GM will
just do it, sometimes they'll come up with a "quest" for you to do for
it (usually involves going out and collecting some loot. Nothing
serious, just them attempting to make the process....meaningful/fun).
If you don't get a response or see a change after a day, petition
again. Keep it up 'til something happens.

If you want to PvP, join one of the Zek servers. Warning, though, EQ
really isn't built around PvP play.
