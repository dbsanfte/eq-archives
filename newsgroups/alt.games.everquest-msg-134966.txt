Hi,

after the patch I had luck logging on - so I went to Blackburrow with my
level 12 bar war.
Suddenly in level 3 this scrawny looking gnoll runs by - being an idiot I
didn't con him, but went straight for the kill...
few seconds after I am running for the exit with my semi-stunned low-hp
character..and is killed by a 'gnoll courier'..
who the ... is that guy? During the fight he clearly conned red to me - is
he a new addition?
Later I saw him running around level 1 - luckily he doesn't aggro...

btw. what is the chance of survival for a level 12 bar war going from Quenos
hills to east commonlands? I need to go there - but a couple of zones on
that route kind of intimidates me...

/mike
