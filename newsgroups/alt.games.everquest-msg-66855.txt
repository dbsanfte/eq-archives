Well... I have a very, very short sample, so again I may just be
paranoid. Normally, as a lvl 35 human druid with around 187 WIS, I have
enough mana to root and dot a blue-conning hill giant, with maybe a
bubble to spare at the end of the fight. Yesterday, I had to run from a
hill giant in NK because of Root not holding for shit.

Admittedly, it's a sample of one, and I would normally attribute it to
plain bad luck. It does seem to correlate with the OP's experience after
the patch, though.
