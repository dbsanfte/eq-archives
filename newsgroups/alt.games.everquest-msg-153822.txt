Guys,

This is what I was talking about.  Clear the game is not too expensive for
the individual but don't you think that they are overcharging for the
services provided?  They already charge for the game itself with takes care
of development.  There are many other companies out there that are able to
provide *free* internet game servers (ie. Battle.Net which uses more
bandwidth than EQ and is just as reliable).  At just 100k users they have
over 1 million a month.  It costs far less than this to maintain a server
room and even then they could buy enough bandwidth to run a medium sized ISP
(remember EQ uses almost nothing in terms of data transfer).

So my main point was why does EQ have an expensive monthly subscription fee
when there are other companies who can offer free servers for their products
without any problems?
