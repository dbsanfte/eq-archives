Roleplay is exactly that. Roleplay. *Be* your character. *Be* the
ball. (Whoops. Sorry. Channeled Chevy Chase for a sec there.) I
play in a 'loose roleplay' guild on another server and my main,
a 55 ranger, has very rarely ever killed a 'real' animal. Not
because of faction hits, but because that's a part of her personality.
My mage, OTOH, finds great satisfaction in killing furry creatures. :)

Figure out your own backstory on your character and 'play' it. It's
fun. :)
