Yeah, due to money crunch right now I had to just go with the single
256 stick.  A little later in the year (perhaps tax time) I intend to
buy a couple more to max it out at 768.

Yes it is.  Creative doesnt show it as XP compatible but then again it
doesnt list XP on any of them at the site=)

I hadnt intended to do the upgrade until the system was upgraded a bit
AND I gave the OS time to have most of the flaws and bugs it was
surely released with worked out and fixed.  Cuz you KNOW they couldnt
release an OS that was REALLY ready for market without us being Beta
Testers=)

Thanks
