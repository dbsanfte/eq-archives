Well, the only real reason to have kids is so that someone takes care
of me when I shat myself in the old folks home if I live to be 100.
Otherwise, I don't really care if the human race dies out after I'm
gone. Who cares. Besides, we had a good run!

I thought of that last night at work. I'm no spring chicken anymore,
but if I were to live to be 100 I could outlive all the people there,
including the ones who are only 18 (though half my current age.)

The sad thing is we could stop having any children in the USA, but
we'd still have plenty of new people coming in from Mexico and other
countries. I'd just have to learn Spanish to tell the orderlies in the
home when I shat myself!
