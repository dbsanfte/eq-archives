I won't disagree with cannibalize or the more AC (under general
circumstances, leather vs. chain) parts, but the only reason shaman (seem)
to have more HP is that they are mostly LARGE races that start off with an
assload of stamina, also, SLOW != HEAL, slow is damage PREVENTION, not
damage REPAIR, damage repair == heal, by your criteria, a necro is the best
healer because of fear preventing all hits.

Torpor eliminates clerics?  Are you nuts?  Yeah, it's great for the casters,
but the 30% slow sucks ass for the melees, and the snare effect isn't too
fun for anyone anyways.

As shown below by the spdat.eff, Torpor heals ~1200hp in 24 seconds, and as
long as we're doing some level 60 dick-waving, how about Nature's Touch,
heals ~1000 hp INSTANTLY, even if it does cost more mana, or let's just go
with the tried and true, CHeal, 10000 hp straight heal, (at level 39 no
less)

Add to this the fact that nearly every shaman I've had the misfortune to
group with has spent more time poking the critter with his big pointy stick
than keeping the tank alive. (and then he wonders why I have 80% mana and
full health after the fight, while he's at 40% mana and 60% health)

Straight from the spdat.eff with comments after the //

Torpor
Increase Heal over Time by 300 (L60)        // 300hp/tick regen * 4 ticks =>
1200hp
Decrease Movement by 100% (L60)          // Snare type effect
Decrease Attack Speed by 30% (L60)       // SLOW == SUCKY TANK
