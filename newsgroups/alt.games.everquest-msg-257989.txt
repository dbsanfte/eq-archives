Speaking as a tank, I've never had a cleric complain if I came 
ready-buffed, unless I didn't tell them and they had to look at the 'your 
temp has bounced!' message.  But I wouldn't be suprised if they complained 
if we got to the group, and they went to all the trouble of buffing me, 
and I said, 'Waitaminute! You don't have temp?  Just a sec, I'm running to 
PoK to overwrite all your expensive buffs.  Be back in oh, 10 minutes or 
so.'  Even if they hadn't buffed me yet, making them wait another ten 
minutes is aggravation enough.

Speaking as an enchanter, no, I never complained if people showed up 
ready-KEIed when I was 59.  But it was irritating, nonetheless.  That's 
one of my major potential contributions to the group that's been rendered 
useless for the next couple hours.  And when it fades, I know we'll be 
taking a 10-minute break while they refuse to settle for my 
weenie-but-sufficient C2/GoM/Brilliance.  At least Intellectual 
Superiority will stack!  Yippie skip!

No, I won't complain about it, much.  But I will be sitting there feeling 
far less useful.  And I could hardly fault the cleric for feeling 
similarly.
