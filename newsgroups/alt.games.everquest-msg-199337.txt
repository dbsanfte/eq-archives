You did not need to do that you just needed to check the rules of the game :

Rules and Policies
All EverWars players must read and agree to abide to the following list 
of rules and policies. Violating one or more of these rules can cause 
your account to be disqualified or permanently banned.

General Rules
You may only post your recruitment links on other web sites, not in 
email, chat, etc.

Darn it.
