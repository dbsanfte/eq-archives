Depends on your goals?  Would you rather have the money or the
experience?  With the GLS, it's a no brainer.  A GLS sells for 1pp or
so, while if you turn it in you get 8 to 9 pp AND some decent
experience at lower levels.

As for the regular lightstones, it depends.  You can sell a lightstone
for a plat or so, but if you turn it in you get decent experience, but
can only sell the book you get for a little less than one gold.

I'm greedy myself, I prefer the money.  I turn in GLS, but sell the
regular lightstones.  A friend of mine is just the opposite.  He will
buy any lightstones he finds on vendors just to turn them in for exp.
All depends on your goals.
