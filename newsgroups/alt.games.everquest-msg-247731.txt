Thank you!!! Printed it out and pasted it to my wall alongside the 
instructions to get to the cow level in Diablo1. This sounds MUCH easier 
to do than the cow-level though. There's no mention at all in this one 
of having to use a European dvorak keyboard to enter Adria's name 
backwards 8 times in between the cow mooing when you click on it and run 
down into the hive and kill ONE mob there in one hit and then running 
back up to do it all again.

One final question. Can I buy the ginsing and mandrake root or do I have 
to forage it myself? Do I say Notum Scrotum in OOC/Shout/Say, or without 
hitting enter first? I only ask because some of those letters are 
hotkeys. Does that matter?

Guess that wasn't the final question. If I can't get an iksar shaman to 
'grow' me can I use a grow potion made by an iksar shaman? Sometimes 
they're hard to find in a pinch.

Thanks in advance. Some guildies are going to help me on this because 
they said the Libretto d' Fini was no-drop and bard only, but could be 
multi-quested so we're going to do it a couple of times. Any hints on 
the spawn rate?
