Normally you can use the /log command in game this will toggle the
logging function on and off  - but you need to remember to turn it on
- and for me - I forget  and only remember after something has
happened which I want to check  

Anyway - you can turn it on automatically by going to your client.ini
file (in your everquest directory) - look for an entry which will says

LOG=FALSE 

and change it to 

LOG=TRUE 

(be careful you dont mess up anything else) 

And voilla - logging will be on for all your toons on all servers
automatically  

Just remember to delete the logs occasionally - you hear tales of the
game slowing down when the file gets to about 100MB  

The logs go into a directory called 'Logs' in your everquest directory
and you can configure YALP to look there by default.

HTH
Cheers
