Hi fearkiting.

My advice, as someone with a midlevel erudite SK, is to reroll if your AGI
is under 75, and put the rest of your points into STA. Your strength (as in,
lower encumbrence limit) will be an issue to begin with, but there is a
whole lot of melee gear with +STR.

At the very beginning, level up in the Warrens and try to get as many kobold
molars as possible. Do the molar quest in Paineel for beginning armour and
sell off any duplicates for ready cash. Do the Fell Blade armour quests if
you can stand the tedium - the armour is the same AC as ringmail mostly, but
has minor stat boosts and looks _so_ much better. =) A word of warning:
ruined kobold pelt drops in the Warrens are incredibly bugged in that they
drop less frequently than intact or pristine pelts, so it might just be
worth your time to get the breastplate, greaves and armguards and ignore the
rest. Also consider looking into the 'Cold Iron' quest which leads to
Leggings of Riddosan.

Once the Warrens starts greening out and you've made some reasonable seed
cash for buying replacement armour, get gear which concentrates on AC, HPs,
STA & STR in that order. Crustacean shell armour is pretty good in this
regard (as previsouly mentioned) as are orc fang earrings. Pick up a decent
2-H sword (Blackened Alloy Bastard Sword is pretty cheap and has a decent
enough ratio to begin with).

Spells: OK, the first lot of spells you get at L9 aren't really much help.
The lifetap is minimal damage/heal, the pet is L5 (I think), and Disease
Cloud only does enough damage to prevent mobs healing. You might need to use
siphon strength qiute a lot. The second lot is where you start getting
useful stuff. Combine clinging darkness with fear for easy outdoor mob
kills.


All this is assuming, of course, that the Evil team  has the Warrens. If
not, head to the nearest Evil team town you're not KOS in (probably Neriak),
get yourself a suit of patchwork and a tarnished short sword, and work your
way (slowly) from there. Killing mobs for tradeskill components (spiders &
spiderlings for silk swatches and threads, wolves and bears for skins) might
be a way to get some cash then.
