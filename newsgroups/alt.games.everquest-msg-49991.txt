well being a druid, nothing less than 10KP. or your best item hehe.
 Typically for a port, 10 - 20PP is good unless it is for a corpse run,
which should be free.
 Many donate items that they don't need, I have gotten gear that soled for
5k (WOOT)
 If you don't have 10PP, then when ever you can afford =c)
