Try Dawnshroud.  That's where I took my shammy at that level.  She got a
little stuck around that level too.  Shamans become less effective as tanks
at around the mid 20's but don't get their first pet til level 34 making it
kind of tough.  Dawnshroud was great.  I'm certain a chanter will have no
problem.
