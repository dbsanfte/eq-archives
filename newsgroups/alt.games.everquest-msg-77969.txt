I read that the fire pet's innate damage shield hits for pet's level
(or pet's level plus one?).  Is this true?  Just how many HPs less
does a fire pet have compared to earth pet, like at say level 29 and
44 for comparison.  That just seems like an insane amount of damage.

I had taken my mage to the Field of Bone from level 14 - 20.  At first
I was using an earth pet but then a monk asked to partner with me.  I
thought fire pet had the best damage output so I created a fire pet.
After the monk left, I kept the fire pet and he had no problem staying
alive.

Sometimes, while soloing near Kurn's I would accidently pull two con
wolf stalkers.  I hurriedly nuked the first one to death, tanking some
of the time.  After the first one was down, I would turn to the second
one and find it was already half dead.

This didn't work for 2 yellow conned skeletons.  I could only manage
to kill one with pet report health then revealing pet had 16% of HP
left.

For level 20-23, I killed the hermit in SK using earth pet.  For
variety, I am using air pet at level 24-25 (by the way, that hermit is
not being very cooperative about giving me defense skills even if I
tank the whole battle, bah)  

I'm looking ahead to level 29.  I haven't been able to find the gloves
of Rallos Zek so may only have air and fire for awhile.  I'm concerned
that neither one will be good for soloing the gnolls because of their
low HP.  I have been practicing though getting the mob back on pet if
I happen to overnuke for a quick death and draw aggro.  

All in all, I'm enjoying my mage a lot.
