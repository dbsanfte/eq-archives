Did an assasinate with a 50 to 55 groups some days ago.
Boss mob was a complete healer and unstunnable!
Needless to say we fail.

Not so sure about rescue,did 2 or 3 lately,went flawless,
finished all in 45 minutes,like the usual collect.
But I think the hostage isnt there from the beginning,and
you have to kill a number of mobs,before it spawns,so
if you clear the wrong portion of dungeon you have a
time problem.If I remember correctly after some time
clearing the dungeon yellow messages appeared 
pointing in the direction of the hostage.This makes
me think,hostage is not up from the beginning.
We had no tracker in group,so I cant say for sure.
