Don't bother going that far.  I play a troll and have had plenty to do
between swamp and neriak.  Wisps are in West Commons and some in E Commons
so the extra headache of Qyenos is just that a headache.  As a level 10, you
can easily find what  you need in So. Ro (Orc groups), and No Ro.  At 10 I
fought Lizzies in Feer right near Cazic Thule.  Easy pickins on the temples.
Oasis is great for middle teens too.
