Ummm, here may be your problem.  The best pet for soloing is NOT the best 
pet for grouping.  The nice thing about the earth pet is that it has the 
most HP.  It doesn't do the most damage, and the root effect is a bad 
thing in a group.  You have three other pets which do more good in a 
group.  In a group a mage should be a damage dealer, you don't need your 
pet to tank.  Your pet shouldn't be getting aggro.  If I see a mage spin 
up an earth pet in an exp camp, I'm going to be asking why very soon.

We won't go into this again, but I think your choices of melee soloers 
would be disputed.
