It is worth adding that double attack and haste have no effect on proc
rate.  I'm pretty sure that even an untwinked Paladin will outdamage
an equal level Cleric in melee regardless, certainly a well-geared
Paladin will.  And eventually the summoned hammers run out of gas as
the Cleric encounters mobs that resist significant amounts of the proc
damage.  They do give Clerics a way to add useful damage when healing
isn't too demanding.
