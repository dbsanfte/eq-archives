I thought I explained the reason I did the multiple turnins.  Because,
looking around at message boards, websites, etc.. etc.. I read
countless stories of people who had lost their tears because of having
too low faction even though they had completed the quest exactly as it
was intended.

And regardless of all that:

I still go back to the same thing I said before.  Would it make sense
if you couldn't do the ToV armor because you killed too many giants?

How does it make sense that a faction you need for a quest likes you
too much to talk to you?

And now I'm doubly frustrated because I am reading posts on the
Shaman's Crucible from people who have done exactly what I did this
week and it worked for them.
