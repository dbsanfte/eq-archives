Under Options there is the ability to set your video screen size.  Not being
able to log in, I can't remember the exact sequence.  you want to make sure
the resolution for EQ is equal to the resolution you have set for your
monitor.  The default is 800X600 which will make a small screen if your
screen settings are set higher.
