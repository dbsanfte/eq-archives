Huh? If the inspection window told you what someone is wearing by item 
name, or displayed the stats, I could see how nosiness could be an issue... 
But it just shows you the graphic for what's being worn on the slot, if 
anything at all. There is no information there that you couldn't garner 
from looking at a character if the engine allowed for it. For example, it 
allows me to see if a "naked" caster is really naked, or wearing full cured 
silk, which may determine whether I give them some plat or not.

The only error on Verant's part was to notify someone that they are being 
inspected, or to call the process "inspection"... if the notification 
message read "Soandso admires your equipment", fewer people would be 
against it.
