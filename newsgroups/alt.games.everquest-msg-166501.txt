Where do you play games? At home. What else do you at home on that 
computer? Have you done it for hours with no ill effects? I sincerely 
doubt it.

Pay attention to your home computer set up. Do get a better monitor, and 
make sure your computer can handle the latest graphics.

Luclin gave me migraines with my old computer. The lag was horrific, and 
the graphics were all stuttered. I could play for about half an hour 
before getting my headache. Wearing plain yellow glasses tends to help 
me, but the headaches didn't stop until the computer was upgraded.

If the doctor finds nothing wrong with you, seriously spend the money 
for a better computer &/or monitor. Examine your desk set up and the 
lighting in that room. Reduce glare, and have other things to glance at 
occassionally. Set a timer, and don't play for longer than an hour or 
two if needed.
