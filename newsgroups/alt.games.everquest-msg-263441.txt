Hmm. Well I run it on two machines. My personal is a P4 3.2g with 1g and an 
nVidia 6800 Ultra. My wife's machine is the same with an ATI 9800 Pro. Runs 
great on the ATI, runs like crap on the nVidia. Yes, this is disappointing 
and surprising, but that's what it is. This game does NOT like my video card 
and framerates in town are awful. There is some kind of major memory leak 
somewhere in that interface between the 3d engine and the video driver that 
slows my system down to a crawl after I've been playing a few hours, 
requiring a reboot. There are some areas of the game (character select 
screen) where I can sit and after 10 minutes my machine will spontaneously 
reboot. On my system, not my wife's. I've posted on this topic in the 
hardware section of the beta forums and I think they're still trying to sort 
out the nVidia's problems. This is probably particularly embarassing for 
them as nVidia is a major sponsor of EQ2.
