Yes, every level 40 mob has the same XP value, regardless of zone or 
type of mob.  The XP you get from a mob is then modified by a factor 
based on its level relative to your level, by how many people are in 
your group, and by the ZEM, which is the Zone Experience Modifier.

Adding to the complexity is the fact that most mobs come in a range of 
levels, so that even in a single zone you may find two mobs with the 
same name, one blue to you and the other red.  Of course if you were a 
little higher level, both would con blue to you... yet to get blue/red 
they have to be at least one level below and three levels above you 
respectively, so a minimum 4 level range.
