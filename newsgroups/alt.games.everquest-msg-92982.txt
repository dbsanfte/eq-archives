Blackburrow (gnoll caves) is the place that will easily take you to level 10
or a little more with patience and is good training for the next good place
to move to over this side of antonica: The Warrens.

This requires a boat ride to Odus and as with all intended hunting zones
make sure you have a printout of the zone map and route from one to the
other from www.eqatlas.com . The boat leaves from Qeynos docks, you stay on
it whilst it comes to port on Eruds Crossing (island with cat people) and
the next stop is Erudin where you get off. Bind in Erudin (soulbinder inside
just off the docks) and get to know your way around Erudin, making sure you
con everyone before approaching. Then head out to Toxxula (sp?) Forest and
it is recommended for your first trip to the Warrens you ask nicely to
follow someone else going there the first time as there are a few "watch
its", namely "The Hole" and the entrace to Painheel newbie area.


The Warrens will take you to level 15 easily. A lot of people will recommend
you head over to eastern Antonica but I suspect that may be primarily from
familiarity, it is quite viable to stay on the Eastern side. Esecially if
you prefer soloing/duo/trio's rather than the madness of the casual groups -
especially the low level ones.... *shivers*

The smaller new user base over the western side also means you get to know
the other people your level better and Odus has a very safe Luclin Spire to
use (In Toxx).
