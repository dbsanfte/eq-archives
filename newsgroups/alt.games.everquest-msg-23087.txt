    I used a Primal because it has a 100 DEX proc. No other reason. People
who have them say that once they get that first proc to go off, it procs
like mad thereafter. So there is a visible jump in proc rate once they get
the buff. They don't need a Primal to have Avatar cast on them.

    And I bet as a Warlord and likely main tank (at times) you have Focus of
the Spirit, with another 60 DEX, on you as well.

    The real question is, are increases in proc rates proportional across
all weapons? Or is it threshold-based? What I mean is this. If a Primal
procs five times as often at 255 DEX as at 170 DEX, will a Ykesha also proc
five times as much? Or are procs figured as some sort of skill check against
DEX, with every weapon having a different "trivial point"?

    And I'm sure you could find some disaffected level 60 shaman who's
semi-retired to do tests with - I hear Eduin is free. ;-)
