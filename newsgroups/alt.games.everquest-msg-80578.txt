Fair enough. Different folks hear different things. I have seen it
posted here a number of times as recently as this week in this thread
though. (One poster saying, "just watch your stamina bar, and hop out
when it gets down to one bubble and sit for a minute")  I hear that one
quoted a lot, and it's simply not true.

As to the weapon issue, I've never attempted to test it, but I'm willing
to take it at face value that it's true, and not a "bad fact". All my
melee characters have had more than 100 stamina, either from birth or
soon after, so I never really noticed the attack speed thing.  I think
my main's stamina is currently in the mid 140's or 150's and with normal
shammy buffs, it's certainly well above spec. Yesterday I was MA on a
Hole raid. Going through the city, you know the kind of adds you can
have, with the chanters parking them like jets over JFK during a
whiteout. I think for the second hour, I never had ANY yellow on my
stamina bar. he he he.

You say, "What? Five MORE s&eh*d# Rock Golems????? WHO LEFT THE GOD
DAMNED BANK DOOR OPEN?"
Enchanter_01 says "OOM!"
Enchanter_02 says "OOM!"
Enchanter_03 says "Back! Did I miss anything?"
You BONK Enchanter_03 on the head!
