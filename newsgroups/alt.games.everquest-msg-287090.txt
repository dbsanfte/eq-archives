I mostly agree that the confirmation on Loot All is just a nuisance,
but I can still think of a case where looting a tradeable item could
cause a problem: if someone else in the group is working on a quest
that calls for him to loot the item.  (Though the more recent quests
seem to use "acquire" instead of "loot".  E.g., for one of the new
Silverwing quests, I had the corresponding shard sitting in the bank,
and when I picked it up out of the bank that satisfied the "obtain a
shard to power the item" step.)

Also, you can shift-right-click on the corpse before opening a loot
window, and it loots all without the extra confirmation (but still
asks about No Trade loot).  That tends not to work well for looting
your own corpse, though, because of the problem you mentioned where
you need to give the loot window time to finish showing all the items
or it'll leave some behind when you loot all.

Still, definitely a huge improvement over what we used to have.
