Never tried one myself, but soon after I started hearing complaints
about its proc rate I noticed the going price in the bazaar dropped
about 20%.  The few proc'ing weapons I've used have all been one
handers, so I can't compare from personal experience.

The other factor I've not seen anybody mention in this thread is level.
Way back when melee balancing was a hot topic SOE/VI acknowledged that
level affected proc rate (I'll bet you're just shocked by this).  I
don't know of anybody who has "proved" this, but my old Ghoulbane sure
procced a lot more often for me when I would pull it out for giggles in
my high 40s than it ever had back at L30 when I first got it.
