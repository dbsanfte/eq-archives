Update. For reasons unknown, I'm now told that *my* machine downloaded
the patch and will log in normally. IBM Intellistation E-Pro 6867, Win
98 SE, Matrox Millenium 16 MB Video card, still running DirectX 7.0, 128
MB RAM (RDRAM, RIMM, 800 MHz) P3 600.  Seems to be operating normally
even after the patch. Not sure what the difference would be for
success/failure between our two machines.
