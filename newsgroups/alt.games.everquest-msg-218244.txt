For the trick I mention below, this is crucial; using knockback
push doesn't help if you aren't shoving mobs into a wall

Apparantly wizards have a AE spell of some sort with knockback. 
Its possible to use this line to "pack" the mobs in closer to the
enchanter and thus get better results with the whole PB AE thing,
since ranges on PB AE spells are so small.  Every PB group I was
in had at least one Wizard, apparantly due to this factor, no
idea if its really as important as people seemed to think,
though.

Single target fast heal
Group heal
Single target HOT
Group HOT
Might as well load 4 PB AE, since you are unlikely to need any
more mana for healing once the fun begins, and the whole group is
going to be waiting for mana after the nukers drop every bit they
have; you won't be able to spend it all but you'll be FM long
before they are anyway.

Some PB groups bring in the mobs in more than one wave.  If this
is the case, then the limiting factor is chanter mana, he has to
keep those PB stuns coming continuously until all are dead.  The
other factor is mob packing, of course, you have to get them all
in close enough to keep stunning them, and later for all the
caster's PB nukes to hit them.

Interestingly, a cleric might be able to provide more damage than
you think in this sort of situation; clicky Tremor boots mean he
can sit there continuously spamming out PB AE damage to all the
waiting mobs while the puller brings in more.  On more than one
occaision I was with groups that overestimated their killing
force (or lost a nuker to LD at a bad point) and ended up getting
kills on dozens of mobs simply because I was the only one still
putting out PB damage.  Again, limiting factor there is the
chanter's mana supply, it was a race between my slow and tiny PB
AE output and his slowly sinking mana bar...
