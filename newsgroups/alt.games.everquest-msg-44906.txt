I play on tribunal too and can't see why you could not get someone to
drag your corpse and lost all that stuff at level 19. Really even at
level 19 I could drag any corpse in dreadlands with an sow (guess im
more experienced though) 

In the future as a troll sk its better for you to take the boat to the
overthere zone and get bound there rather than run through dreadlands.
Dreadlands is bad and this is a case of where people who are lower
level think that a port to dreadlands is a short cut because they have
ports on the mind never having had to hoof it everywhere on the
servers when they first go up. A port to dreadlands is NOT a shortcut,
its the long cut and a VERY bad idea when you have to get bound in a
city anyway you may as well take the boat to FV if good or the boat to
overthere if a naughty race.
