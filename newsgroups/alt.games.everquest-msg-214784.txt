In my experience, the guilds that have a high attendance rule are
usually quite out front in their recruiting that if you don't have high
play time you shouldn't apply at all. Unless the guild mutated from a
formerly casual family guild or the member in question had their
attendance drop as time went on, it's hard to figure out how someone
with a low playtime would be in such a guild. Our guild has a similar
rule though the minimum is 20%, which I guess is a lot less severe than
the 50% mentioned here.
