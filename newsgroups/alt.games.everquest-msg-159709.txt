Except that in the history of the alter planes, lvl 46 is required to enter.
The planes are areas where the gods and goddesses are.  These battles
require high level raids... lvl 25's should not be fighting gods and their
minions.  There are supposedly numerous quests for lower levels in PoK, I
haven't attempted any, so I cannot say definately.  If you aren't near 46,
then don't buy PoP, I really could care less, but don't say that lowbies
should be fighting in planes because that's just assinine and against story
line.
