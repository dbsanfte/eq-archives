SHE.  SHE SHE SHE.  ::flashes the newsgroup:: SHE GODDAMMIT!

No, because in the Bazaar, I can look down and still know where I am.
Cuts the lag to almost nil, whereas in SH I get lost a *lot* and
stumble onto that !#$! portal sometimes without realizing where I've
gone.  If I look up to see where I am, I sit there for 30 seconds
while my computer chokes.  Watch the viewpoint move one inch up.  Wait
another 30 seconds, see where I am, repeat in reverse when I try to
look down again.

The issue is that the merchants won't sell to me *and* the lag.  And
the getting lost. :)  The issue with EC/Freeport is, Freeport sellers
will kill me, EC sellers won't sell to me without a *lot* more faction
work.  And I'm sick of turning in orc pawn picks :p
