    Not only that, but in all your bouncing and swinging you'll likely be
missing med ticks. And that's a lot of mana to throw down the toilet,
especially for such paltry damage as what cleric melee does. You play a
higher-level bard, so maybe you can handle it all, but I know I couldn't.

    As for the nukes being weak damage: yes, over time our nuke output is
weak if unsupported, just like most nuke classes. But we can do OK if we do
damage in shifts. I was in a two-group situation recently where most mobs
were shared, but some were not. Other group has a wizard and a rogue, we
have a paladin and a mage, it's versus undead mobs. We won none of the
free-for-all mobs until I started chipping in, and only if I did the
following. Judgement, insta-click, Exile Undead, insta-click, Judgement,
repeat. Using that I could usually churn out 3 to 4 K damage on a level
51-54 mob and get us the XP. Then I'd med back up, since most mobs were
shared. ;-)
