    This has already been done, and the result was.... nothing. At present,
there seems to be no effect from having Mark of Retribution on a target.
What everyone THOUGHT would happen was that it would be an inverse Karn -
every time the affected mob hit someone it would take MoK-like damage - but
duels have disproved that theory. So now we see if they respond to the /bug
reports on it.

    Now, does anyone know for sure what Intellectual Superiority does?
