Other than the typical EULA blah, blah, blah...In other words be
careful. :-P

I was in the same position you are a couple years ago. So here is my
advice....

Go ahead and take the account and play around with it. As long as you
are not a griefer and don't whine to CS, Sony would rather continue to
make @$12.95 a month than see the account close. I would bet that the
number of Guild Mules and alts that were given freely from player to
player when someone quit is staggering. "Botters/2-Boxers" are a dime
a dozen now.

I would recommend reading up on the net about the Pally class. Since
your main is a cleric you should already know about the spell line-up.
Melee Skills/Disc really aren't that difficult to learn. Most are
situational, and it doesn't take that much trial and error to get the
hang of it.

Don't sell/strip any items unless you get an upgrade. You don't want
to screw over your friend if/when he comes back.

If you die and lose EXP, try to earn it back. 

I look at it like borrowing a friends car. If/When I return it, I
always make sure it is clean, undamaged, and on a full tank of gas.
