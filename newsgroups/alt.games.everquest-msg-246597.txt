Although I have always used Nvidia cards, as regards Everquest they
tend to stink.  I can play a wide variety of games, surf the net until
my eyes fall out, and not a flicker.  Boot up EQ, and you're lucky if
you never have a crash or a graphic glitch.

It's a shame, as your card is perfectly acceptable apart from EQ, but
try and get a Radeon instead.  Some good offers on them at the moment.
