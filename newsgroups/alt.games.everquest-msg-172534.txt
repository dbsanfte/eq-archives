Caller quest is fun, you can get fungi tunics out of it too.  Not the same
as the ones from OS, but very similar.  Same stats, but different race/class
combinations that can use it.  I think that our guild did it with 3 groups
averaging low to mid 50s.  Probably the slowest one, but not sure, I was not
there for either time the guild did it.
