My mistake. Sheesh, went through the entire cleric building looking
for my rezz spell (for 19) and the one that's from the [what I
suspected] Shadow Haven cleric guild (Celestial Remedy) and the last
one, Blessing of Piety, on a PoK cleric vendor costing twice as much
as the average lvl 19 cleric spell and buried among higher level
spells.
