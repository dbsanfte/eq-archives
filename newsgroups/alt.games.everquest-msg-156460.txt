> -How can i know if I can be touched by the spell ?

You can be pretty sure that will always be able to be "touched" (I prefer to
say hit) by pretty much all your own spells. Naturally, there are some
exceptions. (IE Charm-spell etc.).
All YELLOW spells can only affect you.
All RED spells can affect whoever you target - usually including yourself.
All PURPLE spells will affect everyone you are currently grouped with - if
they are not 34 zones away! :) I mean, they have to be within the spells
range to be affected.
All GREEN spells --->

> -What is AOE ?

AOE is short for Area Of Effect. This means that when you cast an AOE spell
at a target, it will affect not only the selected target, but every single
player/NPC/MoB within the spells "Area Of Effect".
All offensive AOE spells are to be used with caution. :-)
