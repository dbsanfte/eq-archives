Most of the Ldons I do are without Shammy/enchanter,
nearly impossible to find one of these two.Groups usually
are made of a lot of melees,Bst or Necro for slow/mez and
Cleric(me).
What a nice surprise it was on my last adventure,when the
Bst linked his tunic with a clickable Celerity.(Their Epic?)

Problem seems to be,as soon as a caster dings 55 they
head to PoV,where as a melee below 60 you are *very*
unwelcome.
