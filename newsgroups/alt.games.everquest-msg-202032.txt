I've never played a rogue, haven't been to the Safehouse except once or
twice to see it, but I can still say with confidence the probable answer is
no.   You can start another site if you're that frustrated, but understand
that you are rowing against the tide.  It's like coming up with a different
operating system than windows.  You'll get some converts, but most people
are going to stick with what's familiar

That said, if you're asking two or three questions a day, it doesn't
surprise me that people aren't answering all your questions.  That's just
too many and you're going to overwhelm people. Expect to get good answers to
two or three questions a week at best, so make them good.
