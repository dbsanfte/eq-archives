Hrm. I guess my luck protects me from port beggars.  That doesn't help when
you lose the rolls on EVERYTHING.

Place: Kael Arena, 2 groups
Loot: Diamond - merit to cleric for peris (np to me)
    Leather Bracer - monk1 passes, I roll 11, monk 2 rolls 890something
    Gladiator Chain arms - I pass, crappy stats for me
    Gladiator Chain Legs - Everyone who can wear rolls, I get like a 130,
one of 3 warriors wins with a 900something

5 hours in Kael, my loot?  5 storm giant meats, a berserker sword and a
giant helm (and like 15pp).
omg weeeeee.
