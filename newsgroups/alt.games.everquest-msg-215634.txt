If there's anything special about New Dawn then these comments may be
irrelevant.

But in regular EQ, here's how quests generally work.  You hail someone, he talks
and perhaps says [something in brackets]

You respond with a question which includes [something in brackets] spelled
exactly the same way as the original.

He responds, you perhaps go back and forth.  Eventually he probably tells you
that he wants something like four bone chips.  If you happen to have them on
you, you give them to him, and he gives you a reward, which may be cash,
faction, experience, an item, or a combination of all of the above.  If you
don't have what he wants (and why should you?) you go hunt and get it; in this
case, killing skeletons till you get four chips to drop, which might take two
skellies or twenty.

Sometimes instead of asking for the items directly, he'll give you a container,
which you fill with what he wants, then hit the Combine button.  This turns the
container into something else, which you then give to him.  Sometimes he'll send
you to someone else, sometimes you'll have to use trade skills like tailoring to
make some of the items you want, there are lots of variations.  But those are
the basics to get you started.
