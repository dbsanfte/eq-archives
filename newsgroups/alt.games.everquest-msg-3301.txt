I'm still doing the occasional spot of group melee, since I am 2 and 6
points respectively from mastering 1hb and 2hb :) (One weird group
last week actually had me and the cleric (and assorted pets) as melee
with the cleric as puller, everyone else was a caster)
Clerical melee contribution might have an impact at lvl 10, but at
higher levels, your melee output is pittance and not worth bothering
with for any other reason than working on skill - which should only be
done if it won't harm the group when you do so. 
As for med-whack-med; there's this thing about sitting down that makes
a mob consider you a snack and I know that at my level, I am not going
to sit down at the feet of something I just tried to hit.
