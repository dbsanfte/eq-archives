Sweet merciful crap.

And as for my archery skill right now, I have discovered that I can
easily take out Ulthork(sp?) Man-O-Wars in EQ easily by
Root/DoT/Plink.  Takes about as long as it took my druid to Rot&Rot
them when he was about that level too.  Only problem is the carpal
tunnel from repeatedly mashing my bow hotkey.  I remember hearing
something about SOE putting in an auto attack function on archery for
rangers, or at least talking about it.  Is that still in the pipe, or
should I just get used to it the way it is now?
