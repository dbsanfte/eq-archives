Ugh, you used your enchanter to pull?  Nuh uh, not me, let the monk do it.
I've heard of folks mez-pulling but that's not for me.  If they can't lull
the extras just bring what you have to and I'll mez 'em when they get here,
but I'm not gonna put my 617AC (after all my buffs) level 52 enchanter be on
the top of anyone's hate list THAT early in the fight.

Besides rogues no class is EVER a "must have," but to slam enchanters as
much as you did in the 2nd sentence is a bit much.
