I was keenly Wiccan until I discovered just what much of modern Wicca
actually was - i.e. nothing to do with Wicca at all.  Having learned 'the
Craft' from Cunningham and Buckland I thought I knew it all and had all the
sayings and the jargon ready to use at a moment's notice.  Never occurred to
me to look at anything by Gardner, though.  When I did I realised everything
I'd learned meant precisely diddly-squat.  And I certainly couldn't get on
with Gardner's philosophy.  (He had one hundred and sixty-one rules
pertaining to Wicca and its practice.  Most of them involving protecting the
secrecy of the thing.  Most of which he broke when he 'came out of the broom
closet' in the first place.)

So I consider myself pagan most definitely, but don't trouble myself with
'paths' and 'traditions' and all the fluffy stuff you find in 99.98% of the
paganism books out there.  I don't have names for the Goddess or the God,
and I don't bitch at Christians every chance I get, and I don't believe I'm
being persecuted, or that 'The Burning Times' were anything to do with the
persecution of pagans.

I don't oppose those who want to follow such routes, but it's certainly not
for me.

I do run off at the mouth every now and then, though.  Hope that little rant
hasn't overly offended anyone.  :o)
