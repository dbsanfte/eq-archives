I'm a 25th level Cleric is the Highpass Keep worth my attempt.My
understanding is that the "RR" room is the highly wanted position.
Do I have a chance?I am not a stupid cleric and I don't know everything I
need to know but I can make sure all my "guys" stay alive.This is why my 1hb
is a little rusty.
But do I have a chance?
