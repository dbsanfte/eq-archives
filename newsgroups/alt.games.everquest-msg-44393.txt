Does not interfere with EQ, at all, period, ever, has not on the custom-built
computers of seven people I know personally irl, if I include myself.

It even is able to bring up its alert/request, as to whether a new patch of the
eq game should be allowed to access the internet, without taking EQ down, like
is so common among apps that bring dialogs up, despite VI's best efforts to
block such.

(extra commas inserted where necessary to satisfy people brought up in the
