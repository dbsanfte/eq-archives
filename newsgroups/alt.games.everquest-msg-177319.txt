First off, you are a ranger. This eliminates a lot of mobs from
attacking you. (The lions should be dubious, the wolves and bears should
like you.) As to the griff types and giants, who are KOS to you,
remember that you can con something from much further away than their
aggro range. Hell, you can con them from across the zone if you can get
them targeted. Sounds like they were wandering by close enough for you
to easily see them, but not within their aggro range. And stuff in NK
does have a pretty short aggro range, by the way.
