That's a great story, and one that I see repeated in various forms over and
over again in the game.

I had the help of a friend who got me into the game (and now doesn't play
anymore - lol). He was also something of a newb, but had many of the basics
plus some experience in the buying and selling of stuff. After that,
however, I really depended on the people I met. I occasionally got teased,
but that was fine when done in proper spirit (which I did most of the time).

I have since made quite an effort to help newbs. My alltime record for
newbiedom was when I was playing my then level 5 mage. I logged in for was
was to be just a few minutes outside Felwithe where I had camped after a
trainer/spell purchase, and suddenly found a invite request with no "wanna
group" or anything like that. I figured what the heck, and took it to find a
7 mage on the other side of things. She proceeds to just start wacking wasps
and bats plus the occasional Orc Pawn - all greens all the time. I mentioned
something about perhaps going up to Orc hill or at least closer to Kelethin,
and got a "Where's that?".

The long and the short of it was that she had somehow gotten to level 7 by
hunting within several hundred units of the Felwithe entrance. I have no
idea how she made it as high as 7 there. Despite the fact that needed to go
to bed, I spent the next hour explaining the concept of xp and mob
difficulty to here, running her to Kelethin, getting her bound, killing a
few things, and eventually finding her a lvl 10 to go to Orc Hill with. I
then had a brief conversation with the 10 about taking care of the newb.

I only hope she did well after that.....
