Best thing if youre twinking, IE looking at the end game.  Put all your points
in Stam.... I am not joking.  If thies is a twink character, then 200 int/cha
will be trivial w/ the enchnat buff int/cha lines.  one thing chanters can
alway use is hp.

at lvl 58 i almost never had gone oom (main, untwinked when i started, mostly
cloth at lvl 30) so int isnt a big deal.  cha doesnt matter for, had 200 for a
while nor they its in mid 140s now, resists seem about the same.  Cha is
overated, I suggest any sort of AC/HP gear you can get followed by
int/mana/resists/cha.

As for race i suggest Agnostic dark elf.  Ultravision for the newb levels helps
a lot.  also hide is a great charm break, if i could re choose my race id
definately would have done dark, elf max stam. If untwinked i suggest 10 in int
10 in stam 5 in cha.
