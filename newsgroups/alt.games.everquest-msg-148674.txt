True, but it's usually slow money and not worth the time. I only do
money ports when someone auctions/ooc's/etc offering a large donation.

>Enchanters can do it casting Koadics Endless Interlect

Not until very high levels, though. They do have clarity before then.
And, by the way, it's intellect. (My own typo soon to come. ;-) )

>Cleric can do it resurrecting people

Uncertain income at best. And most of those clerics spend it right
away on gems for symbol buffs.

>Shamans maybe through selling potions

SOW potions are almost the only viable market potion. Not sure how
much a 10-dose SOW pot costs to make which comes out of the 100pp
average sell price.

>Rangers maybe for there track skill

Very, VERY rarely...

>But what can the others do like this?

Mages, heat/cold stones to humans sometimes. Summoned focus items and
mod rods. Again, not a frequent source of income. Rogues go and pp
hill giants dry (the ones that aren't being fought at the moment. ;-)
Not saying I support this practice, though.). SKs can do lesser corpse
summons. Pallies can do lesser rezzes if a cleric's not available.
Some might be willing to donate for the BL's HP/Mana regen buff, since
it stacks with all other HP/mana regen, but I wouldn't count on much
donated if any.

Warriors and monks...can....umm...tank for a group and
lootbeforethemobhitstheground like they always seem to do. ><
