As others have said, seriously consider the 760 point armor from 
Miragul's. Not as great as the Tak stuff, but quite good, and you're
not too far from unlocking them. Also, the Miragul's set does have
type 1/2/3 augment slots just like the Tak set so you can use the 
cheap type 3 FT augments in them.

And with augments soon to be removable, no more worry about losing
the augs when you upgrade a slot.
