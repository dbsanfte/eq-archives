Most of them don't even read the replies they get. They're not
interested in debate, nor even intellectually equipped for it. They
only care about spreading their message of hate and intolerance.

Happily, Giganews prefilters them based on cross-posting, so I don't
have to see them. The very few that get through are easily added to
kill files.
