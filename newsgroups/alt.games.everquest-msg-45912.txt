Enchanter goes off and finds a new mob, brings it over and parks it while

your pets kill the first one.  Gets nibbled on to engage pet and runs off

to get the next.  Trick is not to be gone out of range when the kill
happens,
so that she gets the exp and so that her pet doens't go out and get
involved
in the pull.Shrouds
