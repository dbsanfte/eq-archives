But how do you train for something like 'healing faster'?  (no,
really, let me know - I'm susceptible to paper cuts :P)  If you get
stabbed through the gut, I don't see how any amount of training is
going to improve how fast you recover from that.  In addition, these
are supposed to be racial bonuses:  if they're just based on training,
then everyone should be able to train in them.
