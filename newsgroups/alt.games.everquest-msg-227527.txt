As my upgrades require either raids or the very expensive ornate plate
molds, i rarely will accept drops for the pieces i am planning on
replacement, and i only roll on specific augments - though if there is a
greed roll i will roll as i can sell it.

http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/userinfo.html?char=272244

as you can see, shoulders [though i am working on the coldain shawl
quest, i am at 5th shawl now] i want the ornate plate arms, legs and
boot molds, maybe the BP though there are a couple of other BPS i am
interested in, belt and gloves need improving...

but as i said at 56, not being in a raiding guild makes upgrading either
problematical as nonguildies rarely get to roll on drops or expensive as
i have to buy in bazaar either the item or a mold to mke the item. At
least as an avid tradeskiller i have a good chance of making most
things. right now - i blew 3 aa points into a new taanan skill mastery
for improving my smithing as i have a number of people who want human
cultural armor for their twink alts...and i am doing aas instead of
leveling until my husbands BL catches up to me...and then we are pausing
briefly to epic both of us...all i need is chardok and ragefire, but he
needs the whole thing.
