that's why it's fun...it's a GAME

sure, i'm a monk, and my enc can cr too . .. being able to CR is more a
player skill than anything else

running for one's own corpse, however, is tedious and stupid, IMO

i would challenge any of you to come up with a system that wasn't tedious
and stupid, but meaningful and immersiveness-coherent, while at the same
time providing some penalty for dying =p
