Nope, you got me there, never encountered him in about 30 levels of playing in
that zone on and off on different characters; he does sound like a pisser.  If the
monk sees him, FD to lose him.  If he manages to wander in on the group unawares,
Evac, Gate if you have it, FD, and we'll come back and Rez the rest.  Still a
faster than SOW mob 15 levels higher than all the other mobs in the zone that
wanders so unpredictably that you can't think of a pull spot that he won't bother
you in... well thats not a good example, more an exception to the rule.  Most of
the time, overpulls or accidental adds are still well within the capability of a
reasonably prepared group with a mana reserve.

If you can keep 30% mana up for an hour straight, you can keep 90% up the same
way.  Now if you mean that you swing from FM down to 30% and then back up... well
you have some fantastic mana regen or you have a funny definition of chain
pulling.

I don't actually mean you keep 90% the whole time, I mean you dip down to 80% and
back up to FM and average 90%.  Or down to 85% and back up to 95%.  So on and so
forth.  If you only have time to med up 5% mana per pull, then you can't spend
more than 5% mana per pull.  That means if you are spending 10% mana per pull and
the pull rate is the same, you have 20 pulls before you run OOM and then you have
to med up the same amount of time it took to do the 20 pulls (each pull letting
you med 5% as we already agreed).  This isn't sustainable pulling rate.  Its
possible to run a small deficit, say 1 or 2 %, if you are going to be chain
pulling only for short spurts and then resting a bit, its possible even to run a
small deficit and gradually run down to OOM if you can be sure the whole mission
will be over before you actually reach that point.

Mana sources: clarity line, bard lines (two of), BAOR/POT9 lines (must pick one or
the other), mod rods, Beasty crack, necro twitch, SK mana suck, Flowing Thought,
Sitting on your butt or Yaulp V/VI or a horse (the last one is not usable
indoors).  But regardless of your mana use, the same rule applies, if you can keep
30% going for an hour straight you could have kept 20%, 40%, 90% going for the
same hour.  Because the question is not what your point is in your mana pool, but
how much of your pool you use and how much you are getting back, and if you are
keeping stable at any given point, its because your usage matches your
regeneration, NOT because there's something special about 30% (or 90%) that lets
you stay there indefinately while at any other mana level you'd be losing mana
like the air leaking out of a punctured tire.

I can have it both ways.  I want to maintain 90% mana, if I'm allowed to control
the puller, thats what I do maintain.  I don't let things go till the slow
inexorable slide of the puller getting more mobs in per minute than I can keep up
with in healing puts me down to 30%, and only -then- fix things.  If I see I end
one fight at 90%, second at 80%, third at 70%... well we are pulling too fast, not
slowing enough, or not generating enough mana for me- something is making me lose
10% per fight and we can't keep that up forever.  The group can fix the problem.
But -I- can't fix it, not by myself.  There's no magic wand I can wave to make the
10% loss turn into a 0% loss.  And getting down to 30% doesn't mysteriously make
that happen either.  Net mana drain is net mana drain, and tactics need to be
adjusted to compensate for that fact.

This is less true of nukers.  If my mage sees his mana bar dropping 10% per pull,
he can easily slow down on nuking; this will not only cause him to spend less mana
per kill, but also the kills will take longer, so he's got more time to med per
kill.  If a healer tries healing less per pull, then the fights take longer
because tanks end up dead, cutting group DPS down.  Plus there's the mess of
having to rez the dead and rebuff them and so forth; its not going to help the
mana situation.

You healed a wizard.  This is generally a mistake, it only trains them to go ahead
and get aggro, and heck, even with healing they usually end up dead before someone
can get the mob off them.

Remedy to the shaman?  Why on earth?  Its not a big enough heal to make any
difference, and your HOT is more efficient if you are trying to feed him mana.
Plus if you are the mana bottleneck (*which clerics often are, and shaman rarely
are if they aren't playing healer) then feeding your mana to the shaman is a bad
plan.  Plus the shaman has a far more efficient HOT than you do; Stoicism, let him
feed his own self mana.  Healing the shaman is a good plan only if you happen to
be FM, which generally means the puller fell asleep or something.  Divine Lights?
Those are the worst heals in the game, mana inefficient, slow, ick!  Better to
cast two remedies.  Better still to stick to your HOT guns.  DL to MT?  He's down
so little that you are actually saving mana by casting DL instead of CH, why even
bother healing him?  Wait till after the next pull starts so he's taken some more
damage.  Admittedly its been a long time since my cleric was low level enough to
worry about those spells, but I can't think that things have changed so radically
that MOST of your list of heals there doesn't show lack of serious thought about
your spell list and mana ratios.

The Donals BP Cheal is usable only once per person per 5 minutes, so its not
really practical in terms of topping off your tank between every pull.  And the
cast time is 30 seconds, during which (indoors) you aren't medding.  This means
its less net gain than it seems, as you've missed 10 med tics.  On a horse, its a
gift of course, but still not a large one, 400 mana per target every 5 minutes,
less than that really because surely you've specialized in Alteration... 360
mana.  Its handy for doing mass rez, especially if you were amoung the dead.  And
every little bit helps when the chips are down.  But its not the end all be all
item.  If the MT or MA is at 60 to 70% hp?  You do realize that a Donals CHeal is
the same amount of healing as a real CHeal... why would you waste a CHeal on
someone who has so many HP?  A fun trick is to start your donals CHeal before the
next pull, such that the fight will start and the target will take some more
damage before it lands; the Cheal is counted as a buff, so it doesn't aggro nearly
as much as a real Cheal, just as Valor didn't aggro as much as a normal 200 point
heal back when you were young.

Its possible that what you are saying is that you start at FM and gradually run
down to 30% before the next med break.  Thats all well and good, but it isn't
"staying at 30%", which is what I'm declaiming as a ridiculous plan.  If thats
what you mean then I withdraw my objections, other than to say that that isn't
sustained chain pulling, its pulling a cluster and then medding back up.

I'm going to reiterate my theory here.  If you started a fight at 30% mana and you
end the fight at 30% mana, then you could have started at 90% and ended at 90%.  I
won't claim you could have started at 10% and ended at 10%, because you might have
dipped down that much during the fight.  I won't claim you could have started and
finished at 100%, because you might have gone over 30% at some point during the
fight, and can't go over 100%; FM is the devil, it means you are definately
wasting med time.  But 90%, I think there's no chance you can't maintain 90%
indefinately IF you can maintain 30% indefinately.

What difference does it make which you maintain?  This difference, if you run into
trouble on 90% mana, you are three times as likely not to run OOM before the
problem is solved.

Of course I'm always saying that mana pool isnt' really all that important.  I
suppose its possible that your mana pool is literally three times the size of
mine, in which case I am condemning myself to constantly run around at the same
mana levels as you... but at least I end up with more clickies, a better mount,
better HP, more focus items, so on and so forth, for the same cash value in gear.
That said, I really doubt that the truth is anywhere close to 1/3rd, I'm more
likely to be at 75% of a mana focused person's pool, because the stratospherically
high realms of mana come at higher and higher cost for the last extra little bits.

And both of us will really be using the same amount of mana each pull, because
we've agreed to limit the discussion to sustainable chain pulling, and that means
getting back to whatever level of mana we started with periodically; you back to
30%, me back to 90%.  If thats the case, we both used and got back the same amount
of mana.  (Or I used less, since I presumably spend my cash on focus and clickies
instead, which saved me some mana, and perhaps on FT items as well, so I not only
spent less, but regenned it faster too)
