Since I got a new computer, an Athlon 1.2 Ghz, I've had problems with
Eq stuttering like mad whenever the fight song plays, or anytime there
is midi music.  I was running windows 2k at the time, and had the same
problem when I moved to winXP.  The temporary solution was to disable
sound acceleration in dxdiag.  Well I finally just decided to upgrade
the soundcard to a SB Audigy (risky since I think that the SB Live! was
the culprit before).  Since installing the Audigy Eq has sounded like
I've never heard it before- wonderful echoes in caverns, crisp clear
music and sound fx.  If you are having these problems and are thinking
of upgrading I would highly recomend this card.  It has built in 400Mb
1394 firewire, digital out, and of course 5.1 support.  I bought mine
online for $67 (oem) including shipping.

Anyways, just thought I'd share-
