John,

Thanks for the rational response.  No thanks to the previous
two posters who fulfilled my expectations on what the responses
to my posting would be like -- u 2 r way 2 l33t d00dz 4 me!

That's true, but one has to admit that levels are one of the driving
forces in the game (especially the new-spell levels).  Unfortunately,
unless I'm missing something, this game pretty much boils-down to
kill, rest, kill, rest, zone, and so on, and with such simple mechanics,
I have to consider the leveling a major component in the game.

As for me, there is no rush, other than my friends are blazing ahead
without me and pretty soon, there'll be no reason for them to journey
with me since I'll be so far behind.  When I have a limited number of
hours to play each week, I'd like to make some progress and not be
fighting a giant spider and other low-levels for the next year.

Agreed and a point well made.  I'm sure I fixate too much on the
leveling and let dying piss me off way too much.

Thanks again for sharing your insights into the game and I'll try
to adjust my viewpoint a little with your ideas in mind.

Mike
