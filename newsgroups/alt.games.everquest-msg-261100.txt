I run a geForce2.  Zero problems since upgrading drivers for dx9
last spring.  Had one oddness today, every time I zone from GFay
into Butcherblock my clip plane goes to zero (slider does not
change position, but have to move the slider to get it back).
Don't think that's got anything to do with the video card though.
