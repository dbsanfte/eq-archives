I wouldn't buy a robe from a merchant. I generally try to avoid buying 
items from vendors if I can get them from players because merchants are 
generally way too expensive.

You could do the Gossamer robe quest in Crushbone. (from memory its AC 8 
and has recently been given a Summoning Efficency 1 focus effect). Its 
an easy quest for your level.

Or you could buy the Flowing Black Robe which is AC 8 with STA +5 INT +3 
from a player. This is generally around 120p I think and has also 
recently been given a focus effect for Necromancer pets.

Or you could get the Blackened Crystalline Robe which is also AC 8 and 
has CHA+5 INT+6 SV COLD+10. This goes for around 600p I think. I'm not 
sure whether it has a new focus effect or not.

These are the robes which I know of in your range, there are probably 
more though. These are much more worthwhile than buying them from a vendor.
