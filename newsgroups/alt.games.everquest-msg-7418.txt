I encountered such a jeweler in the east commons
just today, while looking for upgrades to my
sad little jewelry collection.  I was looking for wis
rings, and she offered me wis 7 ones at (IIRC) 900
pp.  Unfortunately, all I could afford was a pair
of platinum ones, ran me 200pp each for +6.

Wish I could afford "absolute quality" but at the
moment I'll have to live with the 2wis reduction
in exchange for the 1400pp savings.

I'm afraid I made no note of the name, did a -lot-
of wheeling and dealing today.  If Morel Thule
hadn't collapsed once more, I'd be off fighting
again at last!
