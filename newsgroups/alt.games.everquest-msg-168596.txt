One addition thing.
 The Romans had the stone of slavery around their collective ecconomic
necks.
The USA ended slavery after a war that wrecked the nation.  It was the
morally correct thing to do. It was in the outset a social disaster.  It is
only in the last few decades things have leveled off from those events.  As
for the economic effects?  Added more Tax payers to the federal
rolls?(shrugs)
