I'm not saying this really exists, but if it helps I just read a long 
article outlining this scenario in Scientific American (nov 04 issue),

I just thought it interesting to note in response to your line about 
having a hard time concieving of climate change being other than good.

surely you concede it would be a climate change which -isn't- "a good
