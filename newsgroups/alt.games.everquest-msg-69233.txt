  It would be nice if that were the case.  It doesn't take a lot of
time to add in:

 - Fixed some issues that might cause crashing.
 - Further optimizations to the graphics engine.

  Of course, I don't expect them to add:

 - Fixed a bug that could allow a person to dupe, but I think there's
still a few more we're missing...
