Nuke/DoT/Pet...then Mez/Memblur....then let PL finish off.

Trolls can wear plate (Vox or Hero Bracers, etc) Now that "shrink"
works everywhere the size difference between the two races is no
longer an issue.

1HB and H2H should be your main focus. Polished Steel Ulaks (9/27 with
stats) should be dirt cheap. Overall there is a huge gap in H2H
weapons between the PSU and the end-game items that cost a fortune.
There are plenty of 1HB weapons to fill in that gap until your BL is
ready to get his/her epics (H2H).

Overall BL are one of the least equipment dependant classes in the
game.
