Prima has 2 good books out, that I currently use all the time. 'Prima's
Official Strategy Guide: Everquest:The Ruins of Kunark' ISBN 0-7615-3092-4

and 'Prima's Official Strategy Guide: Everquest: Shadows of Luclin' ISBN
0-7615-3678-7.  Some of the info is out of date but 95 percent of it is
useful.  Yeah, I know most of the info in the book is available on websites
but the book keeps everything bound in one place.  The kunark one is best
for looking up who has what spell and what it does.  I can tell what my
partners can and cannot do just by looking it up.  And with the book, I
don't have to spend hours surfing for info I'll only need for a few mins
