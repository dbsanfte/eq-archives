I play a lot less.  Mostly just bored with it, but also the constant
Bard song trouble has got me down.  Bard songs not working again
today for me.  Getting the "you must select a target for this spell"
message when I am kitiing.  Selo's appears stuck on (icon is there
and I am still alive so it has to be on). Got Wizardry 8 and it
works so figure I can finish it and get back just in time for the
game I paid for to work mostly trouble free.
