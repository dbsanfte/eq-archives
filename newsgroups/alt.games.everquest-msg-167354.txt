 No, not really. Been this way for a long time.
 
 Yesterday, I'm in NToV on a raid killing what dragons were up.
I'm sitting there, quietly medding between pulls and I get this
tell from som guy I hardly know that I gated to EJ a few times
many, many months ago (do these people make sucker lists or
something). He asks me if I can come to HHK to come and gate
him to EJ again (he seems to need to go to FoB a lot for some
reason). I tell him, "No, sorry I'm on a raid atm". Like 10
minutes later he sends me another tell "So, like are you coming
or should I camp?". I say "Huh?". "Are you coming to High Hold
do I have to run to WC?". I say "Do what you want.. you'll 
probably have a much better chance of getting a gate there".
15 minutes later he sends a tell asking if I'm coming again.
I send back "WTF are you bugging me for? I'm on a raid I cannot
leave atm, I am not coming to gate you to EJ and who are you
anyway?"
 
 No answer. Even if the reply had been "Oh, sorry, this is 
your_friend_023 on my alt" I still would not have left the 
raid. 
 
 I don't get it. I'm on role so this guy has to have me on a
list or something or have an incredible memory. I said nothing
to even remotely suggest I was in any way interested in leaving
the raid, gate to WC and run through Kith to find his ass in HHK
so I could gate him for whatever reason to EJ. Not the least hint 
of any compensation. Not that that would have changed anything, 
sorry the possiblility of being able to loot something off an 
NToV dragon is a bit more alluring than 50p from somebody I 
don't even know.
