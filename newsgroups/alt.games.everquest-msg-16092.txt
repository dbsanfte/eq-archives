If Krak Windchaser is the named aviak that usually found at the top of the
aviak treehouse, he's a merchant.  I wouldn't be surprised if the centaur
you killed was a merchant as well (I have no idea which centaur is which,
rarely go over there).  So... stop killing merchants! ;)  Especially a
place like SK where there aren't many of them to start with.
