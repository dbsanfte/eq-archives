Need an idea for what to do on a date? Here's how to go about finding
ideas for new and unusual dates that are enjoyable and memorable.

The three most usual choices for what to do on a date are dinner, a
movie, and a public event such as a sports game or concert. Those
activities often give the couple several hours of time to enjoy each
other's company. But relying on those same activities too often, leads
to a loss of a sense of drama and a loss of a sense of importance of
the time spent together.

Human nature craves the out-of-the-ordinary. A new experience raises
awareness and pumps up our interest level. If a couple continues to
occasionally find new and unusual choices for what to do, their time
together will be more enjoyable.

Probably the best way to find new ideas for what to do for a date is
to make a point of being on the lookout for possibilities. You might
see something in the newspaper or in a magazine. Someone you know
could share an idea they have had. You never know when an idea will
present itself.

You should also actively search for new and unusual things to do. A
great place to look for ideas is web sites about things you are
interested in. Use Google or your favorite search engine. Key in words
or phrases that describe the activities and events that you find
interesting and enjoyable. Look through the list of web sites found
with the search. Browse the sites that seem most promising. The local
visitors' bureau is a possible source of ideas. They will likely have
many brochures about local attractions. Look in the community events
section of your newspaper. Check out the listings with you county,
city or community center. Look through the brochures at the Chamber of
Commerce. Look in the yellow pages under headings such as canoeing,
rafting, kayaking, hiking, photography classes, and art museums. Check
the bulletin board at the library. Use your imagination to adapt what
you see at those places to suit your own interests and tastes. Once
you have identified a particular interest, go to shops that sell
equipment for that activity. Ask about events and programs in your
locality.

Keep a list of possible activities. Have a place to keep information
such as brochures, maps, and visitors' guides. Set up folders in your
computer for storing information you have found
