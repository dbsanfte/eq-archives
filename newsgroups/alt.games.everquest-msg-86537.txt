Well check out the Legends forums that have sprouted on places like Casters
Realm . From what I see there is is complete opposite of Alakazam's poll.
They are already starting about a dozen 55+ guilds and everyone is excited
like it is newbie day all over again. I dont see the harm , I find it funny
actually how people feel that Verant is doing them wrong by making a new
server with premium content. People have been asking for this forever on the
boards and Verant is just responding. To me it's  like anything else that
you pay extra for , like a guy with a barebones Chevy pickup saying he
should get the leather interior the other guy got because he has a Chevy
too.
From what I gather people are trying to get away from all the crap that is
on regular servers . People get tired of see 8000 halflings running around
with names like "Portmule " "joeslewtseller" etc.
It may not appeal to everyone and you can bash it all you want , but I bet
there is 8000 people that are gonna be on that server and the more that will
follow.
Half the people whining havent even upgraded to Kunark yet . You would be
astounded how many still only have EQ basic , and feel that every expansion
is a slap in the face by Verant.
