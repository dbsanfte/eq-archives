50000 players online * 1 KB/sec data/player = 50000 KB/sec.

50000 KB/sec * 1 T1 per 200 KB/sec = 250 T1 lines.

250 T1 lines * $800/month per T1 = $200000/month just for the network
connection.

Now throw in the servers (500-1000 computers, since each EQ world
server is a cluster of around 15 or so machines).  Throw in facility
costs (you don't just put 1000 computers in closets and under desks
around the office).  Electricity costs are pretty noticable for that
number of machines.

The question you should be asking is why do you have to pay for the
game?  Why don't they do it like, say, AOL, where you can get the AOL
software for free, and just pay for the service?
