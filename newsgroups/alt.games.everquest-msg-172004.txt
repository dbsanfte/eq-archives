Eh... is Mr. End Times Prophet trying to imply that the only way anyone
might conceivably have a clone is so that the government can raise them
while you go out and get wasted every night?

I think cloning could be a great development.  It would have to be
restricted in some ways so people won't go crazy making carbon-copies of
themselves, but why not?  Religious arguments aside (yes, I know certain
religious people will always say that cloning is taking away God's right of
creation, but I'm talking about logical arguments here, not blind faith), I
don't see any reason that cloning should not be legal.

Also, since same-sex marriages are becoming more common, these couples could
have kids, and even splice their DNA so they would be able to have a child
together, instead of adopting someone else's kid.  Again, religious
arguments aside, why not?  Many gay couples adopt, I think it's only fair
that they be able to have kids.  Of course, this would be a bit more
difficult than ordinary cloning, due to the problems of splicing male-male
or female-female DNA, but I think it could be done, given a donor of small
pieces of DNA to make up the discrepancies.
