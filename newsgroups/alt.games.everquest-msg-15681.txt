Considering we varied CR, FR, PR, MR and DR from 120 to over 310+
without any change in the damage taken, I can confidently say this AoE
is not resistable.

And what next attempt?  Entraiz is a gimp.  3 groups beating the shit
out of her and she goes toes up.  Drops an AC7, 6 to all stat/resist
necklace about 90% of the time.
