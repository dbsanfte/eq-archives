I never stated that America was a democracy . In point of fact it is not
supposed to be one . It has been acting like one though for the last 50
years at least and why I believe we have a great deal of trouble in our
system .

The money isnt the problem per se its the lust for power . Most of our
representatives give us what we want for the sole and complete purpose of
gaining and then keeping power . The money is incidental .

The problem then becomes that you need more than half the people to decide
on issuses based on knowledge and science instead of feelings or emotions .
Since we dont have that we have blackouts in california , property rights
being destroyed systematically , and the growth of a dependant class . Worst
of all we have a goverment actively discouraging the teaching of our kids
because educated kids will grow up to be responsible people who just might
understand enough to make the system work .
