Hey, I would walk but I've got nowhere to walk to. I used to play EQ
and Air Attack on a metered internet connection, and ended up with
�300+ phone bills. (Addict? Moi?) But I just can't afford that any
more, I've already walked from BT and now as I said, I'm stuffed. 

So I'll be trying to get around this new AOL crap with the utilities I
mentioned, and if I do I'll pretend it's some sort of moral victory.
Sure, they'll still be getting my �15 a month, but I'll at least be
getting the service that they promised in the first place.

Good luck with that - if anyone gets a petition or something going,
let me know.

(Of course, what's _really_ annoying is that I have a big fat cable
running right into my front room that carries about 80 TV channels,
but I can't get an internet connection on it. But that's NTL's fault,
so I digress. Useless shower of bastards though.)

Cheers,
Conrad
