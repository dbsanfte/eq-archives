I think everyone is an actor. 

The good ones get paid for doing it.

Why do you think acting is the point of the game?

It isn't for everyone. It certainly isn't for me. 

I just like to meet other people and have a bit of
fun on the way. Sometimes I might roleplay a
little, but I admit I have trouble sustaining it
for any length of time.

I have to ask, because I am wondering why you do
not think the exact opposite might apply.

Instead of the usual persona, or act, that people
use when they are interacting with other people in
real life, the game gives them a chance to
actually drop that mask, lose some inhibitions
(and some prohibitions), and behave in a way much
closer to how they would really like to behave.

Being slightly misanthropic, I think that the
baser instincts come to the fore when one is in an
anonymous medium, not their acting ability.

And being obnoxious whilst anonymous, is that much
easier when there are no social penalties.

No.

A lot of people make claims, with absolutely no
proof or reasoning behind them. If someone makes
such claims in a public arena, then I think it is
fair to ask someone what they are talking about.

No argument there. The question is whether they
can act in a role that is totally foreign to their
true nature.

My contention is, that when they play the game,
they actually stop acting, not start.

How is that proof to you?

I always want to listen to what a person is
saying. I like to make sure they are saying, what
I think they are saying. If they have good reasons
for what they claim, then I am always willing to
have my views amended.
