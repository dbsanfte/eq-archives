You probably shouldn't feel too bad about that one. From what I've been
reading this week, Furor has hit a fucking brick wall in Plane of Earth
B. If he can't get past that ring event, I doubt many will.

Interesting Note: The key for PoE B was apparently not soulbound, nor
put on your keyring. This left the FoH wrecking crew in an interesting
situation when they first got in and wiped. hehe. Fortunately, Sony
still watches Furor's moves and corrected it, allegedly.
