I'd join a group advertised like that in a heartbeat, but that's never the
approach I see taken.

What I do is turn /lfg on as soon as I log on, even if I'm going to visit
the bank or something. Often that gets me an invite fairly promptly. If not,
then when I'm done with whatever my housekeeping stuff is, I head to BB
which (at least on Saryrn) is by far the busiest LDoN group-formup camp.

At that point I most often end up starting a group. Most commonly I see
someone of compatible level/class, or often a couple such people, who are
/ooc-ing LFA. I send them a tell saying, "Want to start a group?" Nine times
out of ten they say "sure", and invariably they are happy to have somebody
else do the recruiting. I find them, invite them, groupsay "recruiting" and
start sending tells to people on the /LFG tool list. Or the occasional
compatible /ooc person. Rarely takes long to get to 4 or 5 people, at which
point I say "we still need a tank/healer/CCer/whatever" and groupmembers
start working their own friends lists or guild lists. Generally gets the job
done pretty quick.

(I do generally play in what are prime evening hours in the US Eastern and
Central time zones, that helps I'm sure).

One thing I simply don't tolerate is invitees wanting to parse whether the
group looks good enough for them. I will answer the question, "Do you have a
healer?", but that's it -- I'm not looking to romance you into my group, I
just want a yes or no. If I say "no, we're still looking for one" and the
player responds "call me if you find one," my reaction is "thanks but no
thanks." And I don't sweat that myself when invited, if I'm LFA I just join.
That attitude speeds the process up a lot in my experience.
