I agree that accidents happen.  But when they KEEP happening, you need to do
something to protect yourself.  When the same little wolf continues to take
our pulls (after our puller has agro'd and is leading them to us) and then
drag his little caravan through the area we are fighting in, I say enough is
enough.  You try the nice approach first (/tell druid Please don't take our
inc mobs and don't run your kites through our fighting area), and when they
don't respond and don't listen, you fight back.
