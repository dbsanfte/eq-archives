I don't think you -can- make a train in there as a 51 beastlord, I know I always
had to work like a dog to get enough mobs up to AE as my cleric, not only won't
they aggro when green, but they won't add either, so you have to tap each and
every one on the shoulder... but ever so lightly, because any real damage at all
and they run away instead of attacking!

Mobs in Warrens range from about 4 to about 25, and killing them raises faction
with both paineel and erud, so you'll see lots of high levels spending a day or
two there just so there's a vendor nearby when they do the Hole... not so much
now with POK so easy to get to, though.
