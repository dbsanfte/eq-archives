	Well, I thought so :-)

	Usenet news moves around via a dedicated "protocol" called
NNTP, analogous to the way web traffic moves around via HTTP.  But it
wasn't always done that way.  Before the NNTP protocol was developed we 
moved Usenet articles around by using standard Unix programs.  One of the
common solutions was UUCP, Unix to Unix CoPy.  That program let you move
data to another system via modem and then remotely execute yet another
program to do something with the data.  So we'd have UUCP send and recieve
"batches" of news then invoke inews to move them into the appropriate
spool directories.

	The joke is that no one's done it that way since 1992 or so, so
see, when he said "If I had any idea of how Usenet worked" I replied that
it had something to do with UUCP, see sort of nerd humor nyuck nyuck...
