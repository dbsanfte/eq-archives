: Necromancer Spells

Bone Apparition (level 1)
Turn into a single bone to lure off all those pesky druids in their
wolf form KSing all your pulls. Make sure you don't get put underground.

Fear self
Fear yourself, but with 80% speed increase. This is a necros
escape spell.

Selftap
This spell takes 60 HP off yourself and adds 40 back. It's also
quite expensive at 70 mana per shot. For some reason, they never added
this in the original game.

: Enchanter Spells

Half spells
This simply halves the spells usable by you in half. This should reduce
the enchanters problem of too many spells to fit in too few spell gems.

: Magician Spells

Call of the Lamer
This useful spell summons you instantly to your own position 


: Cleric Spells

Summon god
This summons the god you believe in. The bad side is this destroys the
whole Norrath and will crash the server.

: Rangers Spells

Major Pout 
This is a spell with a very long duration, that constantly lets out all
pouting about how rangers are the most feeble class on all possible
communication channels.

: Wizard Spells

Magic airbag
Just in case 'Kurnak Air' crashes somehow in hyperspace.

: Shaman Spells

Summon GOA party
For all these trancy needs
