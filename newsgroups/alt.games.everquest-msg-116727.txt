  As in everything EQ, it depends on the situation.

  However, I'm not really that impressed by druid buffs.  Their Circle of
Summer/Winter buffs are good for resists, but otherwise their buffs kind of
fall short compared to what the other classes can provide.

  Shamans are great buffers, but most of the time, I don't really care about
stat boosts (as big as they are).  They just don't seem to make that big a
difference in combat.  But they do have an overall excellent array of
buffs... SoW, Haste, vision buffs, stat buffs for just about every stat,
some HP buffs, regen.  However, I value shamans in groups more for their
debuffs than I do their buffs.

  Clerics are good buffers because they are the best at buffing the two most
important tank stats (AC & HP).  They can also buff resists, but otherwise
they don't bring a lot to the table as far as buffing goes.

  Enchanters are good buffers too.  Their Haste is better than shaman Haste,
and Haste directly increases damage output by a VERY significant margin.  It
makes it easier for the tank to maintain aggro and easier for the
non-tanking melees to end the fight quicker.  So Haste alone puts an
enchanter very high on my "favorite buffers" list.  And of course, all
casters love the Clarity line.  Also they have a decent line of AC buffs,
which aren't bad if you don't have a cleric around.  They also have a really
nice group magic resist buff at higher levels.

  Also not mentioned are bards, who may not spring to mind immediately as
buffers since they aren't "casters" per se, but their songs have some of the
most awesome effects, and this is really the bard's main value in a group.
Their tanking/melee skills aren't that great and they certainly aren't
healers/nukers... the role they fill is SUPPORT in maybe its purest form.
Their resistence songs put to shame anything learned by the other classes,
plus they have Haste, Mana/HP regen songs and really just a variety of songs
which can be a heck of a help in many situations, and most of them stack
with comparable spells known by the other  classes.  That is somewhat
counterbalanced by the fact that they can't sing all of their buffs at
once... really only two or three (and even then, only with some difficulty).
But that isn't a really big problem.  They sing mana or regen song outside
of combat, and Haste and something else during.  Resistence songs aren't
usually needed except in certain circumstances, but in those circumstances,
they are extremely helpful.  And you never have to wait for a bard to regen
his or her mana. :)
