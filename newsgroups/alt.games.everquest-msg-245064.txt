Not that I disagree with the sentiment (my main is a shaman) but
choosing a class around the 'favored toon of the month' tends to be a
loosing proposition in EQ. If you'd listened to popular wisdom 6
months ago it would have been to play a paladin because warriors were
worthless in comparison. Hell, the original 'flavor of the month' was
an iksar monk, how far have those fallen?
