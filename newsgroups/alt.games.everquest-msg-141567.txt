According to the manual:

"Dexterity:, Coordination; affects how much damage you deliver with
a bow/thrown weapon, time between attacks, how fast you learn certain
skills, and how often certain spells and weapons hit their mark.  Also
affects some skills and Bard songs."


So having higher DEX might increase how often a weapon lands, but it's hard
to say how much.  It might also affect the delay of the weapon to some degree,
or perhaps the time between special attacks (like dragon punch).

Someone probably has gathered experimental data on this subject.
