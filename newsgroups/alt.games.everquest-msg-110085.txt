Stop fearing it and start embracing it.  The two games sound like
totally different systems.  To convert a character with the current
skill set to a character with the new skill sets would be like trying to
import your AC character into EQ.  If this is an issue for you its

kidding your self for a couple of years and then being crestfallen when
you find there is no transfer from one game to the next.  There is only
one poster here who knows for sure, but my money would be on no
transfer.
