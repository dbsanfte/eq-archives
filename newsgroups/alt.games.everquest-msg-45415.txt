It originally functioned differently, and it does slow the target. The
original version was horrible, draining 200 mana off the target, healing
less, costing more, and taking longer to do it.

From caster's realm:
SHAMAN SPELL DETAILS
Name: Torpor
Level:  60
Mana:  200
Class: Alteration
Era:  Ruins Of Kunark
Vendor(s):  NPC Drop
Approx Spell Cost: Unknown
Researchable: No
Type:  Single Target Health Regeneration Increase
Max Duration: 24 seconds
Casting Time: 6 seconds
Recast Time: Instant
Actual Effects:
Target: Regenerate Health (1200)
Target: Slow Attack Rate (30%)
Target: Snare
Target: Reduce Mana (50)

This is fairly accurate...I think maybe the people at CR have not parsed
the sp.dat file for this one TOO recently, because the mana reduction was
removed some time ago. I'm also not certain about the attack rate slow. The
snare effect is alive and well however. Still, 1200 hp healing over 4 ticks
for 200 mana is incredible. Downside of the snare effect is that the spell
is group/self/pet-only.

For comparisons sake, the L59 cleric spell Celestial Elixir heals 1000
points in 24 seconds for 300 mana.

It, like all shaman 56+ drops (besides acumen, and talisman of the serpent)
is insanely rare. Shamans who do general groups are severely unlikely to
have it. Raid shamans who do have it won't usually be on xp/trash loot
groups (well, trash loot to them). You'd definately notice if you grouped
with a shaman who had it, because they would constantly be using it to
regain mana with. 1200 hp for 200 mana, cannibalized at a ratio of 148
hp/82 mana (using cannibalize 4) means that torpor actually earns a shaman
some 465 mana points with every cast (plus whatever they would get by
meditating on the ticks between cannibalize casts). Better than clarity 2,
Cantata, and Regrowth combined. Plus it stacks with all those other things
(as well as troll/iksar regen, fungi tunics, etc).

You will notice that I rate shamans a close second to clerics in the
healing category, and that bards equal to paladins only because cantata can
be used while doing other things, where paladin heals require they stop
attacking or otherwise divert their attention elsewhere.
