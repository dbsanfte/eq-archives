Here's what I did to get the medding-while-standing benefit of a horse and
none of the downsides:

1. Turned off all Luclin models
2. Turned off horses and elementals models
3. Summoned horse

If you just stand in one place, your mana won't look like it's going up at
"med speed" but if you click Jboots or some other clicky, or even just cast
a spell, you're mana will jump up to where it should be.

This worked yesterday.  :)
