Depends on what your starting faction was.   I think one Kunark dragon was
about 200 - 300 faction points (1 point per kill in old Mistmoore, no idea
about revamped mistmoore).   Enough to drop you two faction levels if they're
small levels (Warmly / Kindly) or a single level if it's a big one (Dubious or
Amiable).

I think most players began around Dubious with RoS. (Although I could be
wrong, I spent a lot of time in Mistmoore in the 20-30 range), so your answer
is a big maybe.

(Helpful, I know. ; )  )
