I played EQ1 long before the PoK teleports fucked everything up.  It
simply wasn't that hard to hook up with friends.  Your claim that you
simply can't get together with friends without PoK teleports is pretty
amusing, though.  Wuss.

The wuss crowd should be happy, though; you got exactly what you
wanted!

This has been discussed *ad nauseum* already.  If you can't understand
why it's practically the same thing after all that discussion, you're
just too stupid to "get it".

It's all about meeting your group as fast as possible so you can exp
grind, isn't it?

*sigh*

You're just not going to "get it", so I'll drop out of this discussion
here.
