Reinstalled Win2kpro today at work, so no killfiles heh

Just found this on the druids board - may help some others with the same
question I had too:

Posted by Drew as a follow up to someone else's reference of the 'uber' hell
levels:

Uber-hell level"? What do you mean?

Wood-elf druid (millions of xp needed):

level 49: 9.88
level 50: 10.3
level 51: 24.0
level 52: 26.0
level 53: 28.1
level 54: 46.1
level 55: 33.6
level 56: 36.0
level 57: 38.6
level 58: 41.3
level 59: 64.7
level 60: 48.2

All levels after fifty require roughly twice the experience of the ones
before 50, which is why some people refer to them as "hell" levels. 51 is
not unusual in this regard. On the other hand, you get new spells every
level, rather than every five, and it's far less than the difference between
every five pre-fifty (one of which is a hell level there, of course).
"Uber-hell" levels would be 54 and 59, which show the same sort of sudden
increase in xp required as the pre-50 hell levels, although it's only about
50% more than expected, rather than twice as much.

Deaths in 52 will cost you about half a bubble, just as you've been used to
in most levels all along. Deaths in 51 will seem like less, since you get
docked from a number on the old scale.

Thanks all who responded.  So the game starts getting a bit more interesting
now I see =)  cool!
