You want to stay in the areas with exp bonus for PL if possible. That is why
PL is so good. At 20 move to Sol A. It is hardly ever used so no one cares
if you PL. You can set up near the Zone to Sol B (I've heard it called the
rug room or the teddy room) and pull the gobs from the hallway there and
move up to the area over by the bar.  At around 26 or so move to CC and you
can stay there to the mid thirties. I then shift to ML and kill the
rockhoppers and stonegrabbers by the zone to the grey. With that sequence it
takes me about 2 weeks of casual play a few hours a night to get a toon up
to about 40 or so.

I've never done this with a druid at the PLing partner so I'm not sure that
this will work for you.  For my Magi PLing it works fine.
