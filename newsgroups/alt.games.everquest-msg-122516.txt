Interesting, but I'm not sure it cuts it - it helps certainly, but
the difference between the slow spread of word about a particular
player (there are a few on our server) as a particularly inept
liability or arsehole, but not a single outrageous incident...

hm.. you have to go actively LOOK for who these people are right?

You dont see just by expecting them?

So most of the time you're not going to know ranger 72 you're grouping
with is the one who left guild X last week and ebayed all his gear
(yes, happened) as well as the guilds gear...

Effectively we're talking the death of "reputation" and its replacement
wit ha system that requires proactive policing by the players - I like
community, not structured policing, thanks ;)
