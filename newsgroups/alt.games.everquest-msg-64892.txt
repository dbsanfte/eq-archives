bah, Ive had a 733 for the last couple fo years which runs q2 fine. Maybe 1
upgrade but thats it. Not sure exactly of the fps in q2, but in ut im
getting abou 140/sec. If anything, ut has *less* demands on hardware than
eq. Clear case of good coding vs bad, tho eq is way way better now with the
dx8 mod.
