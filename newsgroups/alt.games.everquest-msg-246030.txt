I was in chat for a bit when our server was dropped for "emergency 
maintenance" and the GM there said they were aware of the PoK lockup 
issue and that developers were working on it. They have also set up a 
separate "Stuck Character" room in chat (it's way down at the bottom of 
the list) where you can go in and ask a GM to send somebody to move you 
out of there.
