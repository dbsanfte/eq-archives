No, indeed, you're simply attacking DT.

Like I noted before, the kind of people who get "squealed" upon are
usually the kind who complains that the "squealer" is somehow in the
wrong.

DT didn't break the ToS - Zeppo did. The *only* one responsible for
the consequences is Zeppo.

Hmmm. Zeppo is gone. Seems like a *positive* result to me.

As I've already explained, it doesn't require justification.

Who says anyone enforced them? The only enforcement I saw going on was
Airnews enforcing their ToS.
