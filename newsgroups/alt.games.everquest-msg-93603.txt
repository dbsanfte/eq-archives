Not a problem in this newsgroup, so the signature is totally unnecessary.  
People make asses of themselves enough that no one feels the need to do it 
for them.

It would be much easier to read your posts if it only had the crap at the 
bottom and even easier if it were left off, totally.  Encryption has many 
good uses; using it here is frivolous and doesn't do anything besides bloat 
your posts.  If someone were to impersonate you, it would be easy enough to 
figure out.

I have no doubt you will be getting some replies to this thread, but I 
don't think many will be people looking for info on encryption.

Good luck with your bard.  It's a great class.  There are some bard 
knowledgeable people in this group that are great at answering bard-
specific questions.
