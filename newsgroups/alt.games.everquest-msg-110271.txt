Also keep in mind that most things in the EQ world (Be it mobs, items,
quests etc.) are by highest probability script objects.
Ie. they are standalone pieces of code with variables the intertact with the
actual game engine (serverside and clientside code)
That is how they change specific workings in certain items without having to
rewrite the whole game. But since they are all
pieces of code of different complexity (example, a muffin - low complexity,
an epic quest - high complexity) they are ofcourse
prone to bugs and problems interactinbg with other scripts and/or gamecode.

The basic structure Jack is mentioning is the server/client side hard code,
so if they are making changes to that it is probably under 'freeze'
conditions and restrictions apply to what the coders can and can't do at
this moment until the final changes to base code have been made and tested.

Just my 2 cp based from my experience with MUD development and maintenance,
i am not claiming to speak the truth as i have not scanned serverside code
or anything :) But i am pretty sure Verant didn't reinvent the wheel but
worked from pretty standard methods of building this type of code
