If it was a big enough difference to piss them off, they were already pretty
unbalanced.   And I'd be suprised if he didn't have a warrior stocked away
somewhere.  If his hissy fit wasn't motivated by "enlightened self interest"
then he's really out there somewhere.

Doesn't matter where the crits come from.  The only thing having "natural"
crits gives is, as you said, a bit of eye candy at lower levels.   They
claim it carries over when we buy the critical hit AA's, giving us a higher
AA enhanced critical rate than others, but I've not seen any kind of a
significant advantage.  (And actually, I've still yet to see any evidence
that they didn't screw up the coding and give everyone the same chance based
on AA levels, ignoring "innate" critical abilities)

Rogues also get deadly strikes.   If thier throwing dagger hits the mob in
the back and rolls critical, it's considered a deadly strike, and upgraded
to 3x damage instead of 2x.  Of course, throwing damage is so pathetic that
this means precisely nothing in the grand scheme of things.

My rogue has a choice between throwing daggers at the mobs back for deadly
strikes of up to 36 damage, or meleeing the mob in the back for up to 4x 100
+ 2x 550 damage per combat round.   Which one sounds like the bettter choice
to you?  (I'll ignore the chance of triple backstab, cause the damn AA
almost never goes off : / )

Warriors can critical hit with anything.   (And oh boy were rangers pissed
that we could critical hit with bows while they couldn't.)

It is exactly that, just as it is for warriors.  With all the AA's complete
it may work out to a modest dps increase, but then all of the melee classes
can get that same dps increase from thier critical hit AA's.
