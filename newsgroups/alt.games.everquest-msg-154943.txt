They have a slightly larger AoE radius, I believe.  They might be useful for
pulling a group of mobs that are just slightly too far apart to hit with
other spells.  E.g., the Wyverns in Cobalt Scar around the exit to Skyfire.
I know I've got *some* spell that can manage to actually get two of
them--and my normal AoE and Atol's only get one.

(What I usually do is stun one, stun another, and then SoTF a third as I run
for the window.  While running for the window, I try to target a 4th and
SoTF it.  Usually I only get 3, though).
