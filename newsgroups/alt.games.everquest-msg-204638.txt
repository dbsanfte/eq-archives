I almost always redid my ensnare when the charm broke, so I never let
it get that far, but I wouldn't be surprised.

Fastest exp 40+ I ever got was charm soloing with my enchanter. I bet
a bard would be even faster, and of course AE groups back in the day,
but nothing else would be.

Every once in a while the recharm on the pet went poorly and I'd root
with the druid to catch my breath. In these cases I sometimes had my
pet rooted. I'd use the druid to root the new mob just as it passes
the pet by. Bingo, no more aggro problems.
