Well, I port when I need to go somewhere unless the money is really
tempting.

Explained: Say I am headed to the Hole or Stonebrunt. I will shout out
"Free poert to Tox, leaving in 5 minutes! 5 seats max" Then I wait a
bit. I group all who show, and port. No one shows, I port alone.

I see an auction "300pp for a port to xxx" I may hesitate. I see
"1000pp for port" I WILL hesitate.. ;-)
