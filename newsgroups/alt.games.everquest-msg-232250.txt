In most cases, if you only have static spawn mobs agro on you, all you have
to do is wait for them to return to their spawn point.  Wandering mobs,
however, can be an extreme pain in the butt because they may take almost
forever to get to their spawn point (either that or it doesn't reset them).
After you've played with FD and agro for a while you start to get a feel for
how this works.  This problem is most evident in PoP - many older zones are
more sane in how agro works.
