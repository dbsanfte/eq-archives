Right, I'm lvl 47 now and up to this point no pet could hold a monster's
attention when a player was near. Just stand next to a monster and do
nothing will let it target you instead of the pet, who is doubling and
quading attacks all the time.
Last night I fought alongside a lvl 51 mage and his earth pet actually could
taunt the monsters away from me. So I was wrong in that sense.

What did strike me as odd was the +100 str in the buff. I know pets have a
fixed amount of dam cap for a level. Why the +strength then? Does it
increase amount of max hits or something?
I've let a shaman cast a strength buff on it a few times but didn't really
notice a difference in dam-output. Haven't crunched numbers though.
