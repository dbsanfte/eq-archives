Pfft. Wrong. My main is a bard.I have no problem at all with the latest 
bard nerf, and it was a pretty significant one. The thing is, it was also 
completely justified. The rate at which bards were racking up xp was just 
stupid.

It's just as stupid for a chanter to be able to charm a pet that will so 
easily outdamage the rest of the group, yet take virtually no xp.

The bard and enchanter nerfs of late were not at all spurred by envy. They 
were all about common sense. They corrected aspects of the game that 
contributed to significant imbalances. You don't leave something broken 
like that just because the respective classes involved have other 
legitimate complaints.
