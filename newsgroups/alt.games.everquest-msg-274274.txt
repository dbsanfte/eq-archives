I've not kept up with this thread beyond gathering that you're claiming 
that use of the words "pussy" and "wimp" are interchangeable, and that as 
such, since "wimp" wouldn't warrant any diciplinary action, "pussy" 
shouldn't either. Well pal, that's a load of self-justifying crap.

Let me put is simply. Are there people in whose presence you would 
consciously use one term over the other? Your minister (stretching a bit 
there)? Your mother? Grandmother? How about a judge? How about someone 
else's young child (heaven forbid you yourself procreating - procreating 
yourself, otoh...).

If you answered yes to any of the above, then it's quite clear that you 
understand full well the difference between the two terms. If you answered 
no to them all, then you have serious social deficiencies that you should 
have addressed by a professional.

I'm giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming you're not just being 
a complete and total dickhead here, but rather it's a medical condition. 
You should take that and run at this point. For you this can only go 
downhill from here.
