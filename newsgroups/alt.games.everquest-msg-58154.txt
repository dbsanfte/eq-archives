Hmmm, my "everyday" hot keys are #1 sit/stand toggle, #2 hide, #3 /con, #4 /sit
off /cast 7 (root), #5 es vambraces, #6 warden symbol of tunare, #7 /loc
/doability 1 (sense heading - if it's not maxxed, you can add /pause 16
/doability 1 to give you a better chance of it actually working and run it up a
little faster), #8 track, #9 forage, #0 /target meysura <insert your name here,
of course> /cast 1 (camo)

I also macro healing (/g inc sup heal on %t /cast 1), snare (/g snaring %t /cast
8), root (/g rooting %t /cast 7) and evac (/g EVAC'ING - HUG THE DRUID (repeated
three times, just to make sure no one misses it in the heat/spam of a losing
fight) /cast 2) when I'm grouped; but that doesn't happen that often these days.

Oh, yeah, and I have a bank of hot keys set up to open my spell book to various
sections: buffs, resists, combat, travel, rings, circles, kun/vel ports, evacs,
heals, animal spells.
