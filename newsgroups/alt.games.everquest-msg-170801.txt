15% of what?

It certainly doesn't mean that 15 out of every 100
people who have sex, using a condom, with an
infected partner, will get the disease, does it?

I agree. 

What I dont agree with is Sanjians assertion that
a person wearing a condom is ".... taking a 10%
risk of being infected if they're sleeping with an
infected person?"

I don't think he was saying that at all, the

The corpsman was either wrong, or Sanjian took
away the wrong impression.

I do. I cannot believe that a sex educator would
say to his pupils "A condom provides 100%
protection... never mind about the manufacturers
notes, on the product, that expressly say it does
not give 100% protection"... but thats just me.

Did you never read the instructions on a condom?

Perhaps he was told that, but I find it amazing,
not only that he was told that, but that he
BELIEVED it.

I consider it a lie when factual error is used to
promote some other agenda.

Which lowers your 15%, (and Sanjians 10%)
considerably, doesnt it?
