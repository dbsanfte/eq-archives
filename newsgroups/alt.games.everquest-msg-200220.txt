I use the Thrustmaster Tacticalboard. It's basically a programmable HID-
compliant keyboard with macro capabilities. For the first six months I had 
it I would have spit on the name of Thrustmaster, the implementation and 
software were so bad. However, with the latest version of the supporting 
mapping software it works very well for my bardic needs. 

I mapped seven of the eight gem slots to the seven thumb buttons. There are 
many buttons I don't even use, but most are very accessible with the one 
hand.
