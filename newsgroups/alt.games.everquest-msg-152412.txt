Guess it's a good thing I wasn't planning on playing today anyway.  Last I
recall though, my traceroute showed it going through AT&T, so maybe I would
not be affected.

On a related note, I noticed that EZBoard was down yesterday afternoon,
since then, they have put up a message saying they are upgrading their
system, and will be back up 8PM tonight PST.  Originally said midnight, then
8AM, now 8PM.
