Well, actually, I'd quit playing for quite awhile before and after 
Luclin came out *g*  And I could have sworn there was more to my hiding 
than that.  And, technically, I don't have *any* spare parts because, 
well, two years ago when I *did* upgrade, I upgraded my parent's 
computer.  Right now I own one tower and everything in it, and a very 
nice mouse.  The parents own the printer and the monitor and the old 
tower and everything in it.  Still.  I'm sure I can find some way.  
Eventually.  I'll just have to spend more money than I thought, I 
suppose :/

Ah but I don't know *how* to build a computer.  Which would be another 
problem.  I don't suppose there's a "building a computer for dummies" 
book out there...

Friends?  What are these friends you speak of?  (And in all seriousness 
,what's an ATX case?)

*snerk* You mean it isn't already?

STOP THAT!  I'm already resolving never ever to get a second account.  
After all, it isn't worth it.

Unless I want to make that druid to move all my chars around... oh, and 
the cleric for some PL healing.  And maybe... crap.

I always knew gnomes were evil.
