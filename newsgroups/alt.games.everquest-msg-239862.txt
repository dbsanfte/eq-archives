Hi all,

My first character was recovering loot from his corpse last night when a
character (didnt note name) offered to res or donate for a res (something
like that) me claiming that this would give additional xp. I stopped
mid-loot and followed the instructions but didn't gain xp and my abilities
were seriously depleted for a short while. Could anyone explain what
happened? The character then buffed me so I in no way think that it was in
any way malicious.

Andrew
