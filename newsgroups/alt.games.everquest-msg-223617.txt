Stinging wort has definitely saved my butt a few times.  Chug an entire
10-shot at once (insta-casting) and it's like a CH from a level 58 druid.
:)  Only !#%!#$!@$%!$^#%^ thing is that it doesn't stack with Protection
of the Wild, my 65th level 4-in-1 self-buff, so I have to sacrifice a buff
to use it. (Aye, it takes a buff slot because the spell calimony slowly
takes away 300hp over 2 minutes.) I believe it has problems with Paladin's
self-buff as well. So I only use it when weaponshield has run out and the
healers are dead or feared.  Still, it's another tool at my disposal that
is worth taking advantage of.
