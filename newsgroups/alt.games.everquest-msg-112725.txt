My L15 barb BST has 260p in the bank from just selling junk loot and pelts
in the WC area, and almost 200p of that is from pelts. So save the HQ pelts
(Bear and Cat) and even the MQ ones too, the higher-ups will easily pay for
the conveince of them.

Believe me when I say I am no twink either, the best junk I kicked down was
a velium warhammer, but that won't proc for a few levels yet...

Good Luck and Good Hunting!
