I put our Chardok raid on hold for a couple reasons but it's time finally 
to gear up for it.  Unfortunately, I got some disturbing news - if you want 
to CoH in, your mage has to not only be Non-KOS, but also Ally.

I'm going to work on the premise that this is true.  Going with that 
premise...

1) Why?

2) Assuming we have a Non-KOS mage who isn't even -close- to ally, what is 
the safest place that they can go in and CoH the force?

[ map: http://members.cox.net/mageknight/images/chardok_path.jpg ]

3) Looking at the map above, the outlined path has the force going up the 
gut at (A).  The last Chardok raid I went on, they took the north passage 
into the Royals area instead of the middle one like the map shows.  What 
are the benefits of the diferent paths?

4) Again referring to the map, is it possible to pacify all the way to (A) 
( except for the problem with the mobs in room (4) )?  Have any of you 
successfully done this?

I've seen what it takes to get to Ally, and it's fairly daunting to ask 
someone to do, so I'm looking for the best solution for a semi-small raid 
force ( 16-20 people ) who want the Overking.  I have friends in an 
alliance that has an Ally mage and Ally rogue.  I will probably ask to 
borrow them for the raid, but I'm going to plan as if they won't make it.
