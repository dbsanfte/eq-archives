Checked it out, liked a lot of the pics (wish I could have screen
resolution set that high!) , glad you have plate arms now since they
complement plate tunic much, much better than chain arms do, the fact
that plate boots look much less clunky on half elves than on wood
elves is duly noted, AND I want an updated pic :)
(I had to laugh at the pic of the ranger KS group, more specifically
at Mr. too badass for a visible tunic on the left :p What armor is
blue chain and what is dark green chain, by the way?)

Thought it might be rubi, haven't heard of shadowscream armor.
(Purple: shadow's cream? :) )

I know, too bad I've sworn off wearing leather tunic/legs. I am
looking to ditch my blue nathsar arms since it's the most clashing
piece I have - if it's not a full set or combined with gnome skin, the
blue is kinda 'loud' :)
I think I'll toss some pics online on http://home.tiscali.no/~celaeno/
if you want to see my current harlequin druid look :)
