My own personal experience. I had one group a while back that nearly made me
swear off groups forever. Thier entire strategy was for me to go pull stuff
back to them so they could kill it. That is unless they weren't too
distracted talking about sex, scat, incest or some combination there of, in
which case they didn't even notice that I was fighting something right in
front of them. Needless to say I disbanded and put the whole group on
ignore.

They didn't know anything whatsoever about any of the things that you
mention.  That isn't typical of groups but one of those encounters is all
you need to sour you on pickup groups forever. The truth as I've found it is
that a lot of groups that a casual player such as myself is likely to get
into, often suck, a lot.
