True, but I don't minimize it.  I dunno, weird thing with me; I hate having 
*any* messages off.  A friend of mine (who I recently got re-addicted to 
EQ, heh heh) turns off his misses, which I didn't understand.  I guess I 
*want* to know if my character is flailing ineffectually at the air.  ;)

Xnews is what it's called, and so far so good.  I'm still getting used to
