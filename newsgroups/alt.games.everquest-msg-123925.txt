At that point you should have just engaged, you had the people no one
else did. It sounds as though no rage fire had popped yet anyway. If
the guy was not even there, your whole post and getting the guide is
kind of moot. Getting arbitration for what does not exist is jumping
the gun. It is important to note that you might have up to 72 hours
and no guide is going to hang around for that long. What the guide/GM
does not see the guide/GM does nothing about.

The unwritten rules seem to be whoever has a sufficient force and
spawns the mob gets it. 8 or 10 people could not kos you anyway.

You'd want to stack the "kill credit" group with the cleric who is
going to loot though, otherwise you'll end up with a corpse timer to
loot and other people possibly right clicking fast also. My guild had
this happen in a ragefire thing where we had the force, jumped the
thing, got the kill, someone in some other group right clicked their
way to the goody before our cleric could. Gm intervention later got
our cleric the piece back (they can check all of that, what
people/guild got kill credit, etc) and something likely happening to
that other cleric.
