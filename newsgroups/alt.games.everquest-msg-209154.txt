There is no standard role for bards.  It depends on the group and the
locale.  You have to be thinking all the time of what is the most value you
can bring.  Manasong is almost always useful.  You also have hastes which
can be dropped when there is shaman or chanter haste.  Later you will get a
haste that stacks with theirs.  You also have decent slow which can be
dropped if there is a shaman slowing.  If there are casters you have resist
songs.  You have decent melee but will often have to decide whether to melee
or use instruments to double the power of your songs.  Always think about
what you can do and what the group needs.  See also www.eqdiva.com
