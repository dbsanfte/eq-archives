Oh really? 

Let's see, free beta slot for buying the product. Enter to "win" a
slot in the beta if you don't.

Free Making of X2 disc if you buy an XMen Evolution DVD. Enter to win
a disc if you don't.

<sarcasm>Nope, they don't compare at all. </sarcasm>

So, you don't want it for free, and you don't want to pay for it.
Sounds to me like what you DO want is something to bitch about, and
you want it so badly that you'll bitch no matter how stupid the
reason.

Superficial? The fact that it's a different genre doesn't change the
fact that the games are branches of the same line. Your logic
completely and utterly fails when you apply an IQ over 50 to it.

Again, bullshit. See above. The comparisons and such from either one
of us don't work without the contest.
