I wonder whether this and the potion belt are different or not.
There are many times when I find myself opening my inventory,
opening a bag, (maybe closing it and opening another bag because
I've forgotten where something is!), clicking on an item,
swapping it for one of the bags in my top level inventory,
right-clicking on it while holding the bag on my cursor, then
putting the bag back and dropping the item back into its bag.
I also do swap weapons a lot, and not just on my pure melees.

- My monk swaps in a Stave of Shielding until it procs, then
wants to switch back to his Adamantite Club.

- My monk also swaps in Jboots to refresh his run speed, but I
don't want to leave them in a top-level slot (even if I don't
currently have all slots filled with summoned WR bags) because
of the weight.

- My wizard has 7 bags and reserves one top-level slot for his
Crucible of Escape (clicky evac), but swaps in his Staff of
Temperate Flux.

- My druid, who still does a bit of melee, sometimes switches
from a 1HB to 1HS to keep both skills up, but needs to be able
to switch back in a hurry if the fighting gets serious.

Anyway, I'll be very interested to see how they've implemented
these features.
