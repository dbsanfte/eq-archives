When you say "like the one in the video" I assume you mean the fact that he
used unnecessary force.  If that is the case I believe you are wrong.  While
it may be true that the extent of the abuse may not be as bad as seen in the
video It is my experience that it is very widespread in nature.  I've
personally been cuffed twice by police and each time they made sure that
they caused me extra pain.  Mind you I wasn't even placed under arrest
either time.

As for understanding a cop's attitude, as  I understand it being a policeman
is a voluntary occupation.  If you can't do your job professionally, don't
do it at all.
