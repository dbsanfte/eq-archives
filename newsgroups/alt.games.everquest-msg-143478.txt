Harmony?  Really their aggro range is so huge that they are hard to avoid, but
learn the area well and you'll learn where you can and can't step without
adds.  You might want to consider root rotting instead of traditional quadding,
you can keep several mobs rotting at the same time, assuming you are using
clicky DOTs for damage production this is can be as efficient in terms of kills
per hour.

SOE Back?  Bind on the island (in one of the safe spots) and gate back.  Thats
a big 50 mana spent, less your what, 2.5% discount for 50 specialize... a couple

tics medding if you really absolutely need to be FM to pull.
