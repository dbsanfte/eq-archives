I use an older version of Norton Security (2002). I have a problem sometimes
when EQ or the Norton itself updates. The screen that asks you to allow the
game through came up behind EQ and I had hard time switching to it so I
could allow it. I solved that problem by now scanning for Internet
applications through Norton when something updates and allowing before I
even open EQ.  Hope that helps.
