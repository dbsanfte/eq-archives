Are you really comparing the cost of malachites to the cost of
peridots? We're talking about a 7sp gem and a 10+pp gem here.

My druid keeps the peridots I loot for future buff needs. If there's a
cleric in the group, I immediately hand over peridots I loot the same
way I do with caster research components. And when my melee classes
get up there in level, they won't demand high symbols unless they have
peridots at hand either.
