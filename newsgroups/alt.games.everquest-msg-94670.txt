Ok... forgive the stupid questions...

I'm a 34 druid, been playing off and on... starting playing more
regularly now.

I want to get my level up much quicker (had this main for a year and a
half)... and I keep hearing about quad kiting and how it's great exp.
(I guess it's what it sounds like... getting four mobs together and
dotting, dd'ing 'em to death)...

Just bought/quested a bunch of wisdom stuff... and now have 170+
wisdom (base was 95)... but It still seems like mana goes REALLY fast
when casting those DOTs or DDs.

So my question is... how easy is quad kiting (since it seems like mana
would go VERY fast) at my level, and where can I do it easily?
