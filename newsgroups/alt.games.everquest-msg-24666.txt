I allways kinda felt sorry for Angus... but then again, that's
Donaldson's MO, taking a total and complete bastard and making him a
sympathetic figure.

But, yes, Donaldson is a very complex, very *deep* writer.  Tolkien
and Jordan seem like children's story writers when compared... it's
remarkably difficult to go back and read other fantasy series after
being exposed to the stark despair of Covenant.

That being said, so far George RR Martin's "A game of thrones" has
been one hell of a read.
