Nope, the mez message is '<a mob> stumbles toward you'  At least that's 
how it appears to me, even if another bard is doing the mezzing.  Hmmm... 
just verified with eqdiva.com.  Yep, 'eyes glaze over' is charm message.

Well, in that case screenshots are your baby.  Not perfect, but if you 
mention in your petition that you have screenshots because your combat 
spam makes it tough to fit all in one window, it may help.  Also, if 
you make your chat window as large as possible, and set the font to the 
minimum size before you /report, you should get a couple extra lines.  
Though since you're a monk, it will probably just be 10 more lines of 'you 
crush <a mob> for 3 points of damage'.  :)

At this point I am reminded of Fansy the Famous Bard.  
(http://www.geocities.com/sub21ubi/fansythefamous.htm)  He may have been a 
dick, but I think he was the funniest griefer of all time.  Take a lesson 
from him, and remember the castle mobs love you, and hate the dickhead.  
They're a bit singleminded though, and may squash others on the way, they 
don't mean it, they're just big and clumsy.

Well, it depends.  Most bard songs are single-target or group-only.  The 
AE songs generally have a limited range, but on the LF (on Innoruuk 
that platform is Lower Frenzy, the top of the same slippy ramp is Upper 
Frenzy [UF], the back corner is Top Spiders [TS], and the eyes camp is 
Crystal Eyes [CE]) platform it will definately hit all the spiders on that 
platform, and will generally hit TS, if they're fighting near the ramp.  I 
have used my AE song as an auto-pull when I'm doing CC, but very few bards 
use the AE snare/slow song.  Look for '<a mob> is bound in strands of 
solid music'.  
The only AE buff songs we get now are PR/DR, FR/CR, and manasong.  It's 
possible that he has the AE manasong, but since it drops of mind burrowers 
in Akheva, is EXTREMELY sought after by raiding guilds, and comes from 
mobs that are hard to pull and semi-hard to kill (by exp-grind standards), 
he most likely doesn't have it.

I'm not saying to do more damage.  I'm saying break his mez, let him get 
stunned.  Watch him die.  Cheer.

OK, how do you have 2 disco groups?  On Innoruuk at least, Disco is the 
camp on the stage under the disco ball, over the bridge to the left from 
the UZO hallway.  Where does D2 setup?  I'm really starting to notice 
server differences in camps and camping protocol.  I'm almost tempted to 
start an alt on a different server, but I don't care much about orc1 and 
orc2.  :)
