If you put that many miles on a truck and keep it that long then I
think you're worrying before the problem.  In 9 years I would bet V6's
will come back into style for at least one of the reasons you
mentioned, economy.  Right now the US doesn't seem to care if they
plunk $80 into the gas tank of their Excursion, as long as it's big.
That wasn't always the case and it won't always be the case.  Things
have a tendency to come full circle.

Of course, I am one of the people who plunk $80 into his wife's
Suburban but I do care.  I just don't care enough to change it yet.
Maybe once the kids are older...
