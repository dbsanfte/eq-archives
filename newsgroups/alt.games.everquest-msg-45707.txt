The Runed Totem Staff drops of gnolls in Lake Rathe, at a mob around lvl 18
or so. They usually sell for 10pp.
I myself would suggest to try to buy a velium weapon of some kind. Those go
for 6pp, have decent stats and are magical.

Or befriend a nice Magician who can summon you some weapons until you can
afford your own :)
