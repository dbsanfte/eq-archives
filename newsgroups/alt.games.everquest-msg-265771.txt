If that is the purpose of the archetype system, then you are correct.

However, -if- the idea is that you pick an archetype at creation, then 
play a while, and pick a class after you are familiar with the game and 
know more about your preferences, and then play a bunch more, before 
picking a subclass when you really know what you are about, then 
Alignment breaks this model; you really picked your subclass at 
creation, in a way, by picking the alignment.

note: I have no idea if this is true, or if this is really what Ken is 
complaining about, it just looks that way to me, as a person not in beta 
but just reading about the system here in this thread
