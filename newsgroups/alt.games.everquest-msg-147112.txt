It's not that easy to seperate them.  One belief system has a
built-in control mechanism; one doesn't.  It's not the idea of
the final judgement that's important;  it's the idea that someone
else - God, your neighbor, society in general - is sitting in
judgement.  That provides an inherent check on the feedback loop
missing from self-centered doctrines.

Sure, but look at context.  Take apartheid, for instance:  it's
impossible without the context of "it doesn't harm them because
they're not as 'human' as I."  The same is true for caste systems,
of course.  The social structure always breaks down for objects
outside the society itself.

That's as much a problem for the Judeo-Christian belief system
as it is for any other, of course, but -- in theory -- that same
scripture deals with it:  Judge not lest ye be judged, Let him
who is without sin cast the first stone, If you minister to the
lowest amongst you, you minister to me, and so on.

Failure to behave according to a professed belief isn't limited
to people of the Judeo-Christian mythos.  But, at least in theory,
they're far more susceptible to social change and a social
conscious.  Let's not forget:  for all the crusades, etc, it was
also largely the Judeo-Christians that got rid of slavery, that
condemned overt torture of religious heretics, that championed
the civil rights movement, etc.
