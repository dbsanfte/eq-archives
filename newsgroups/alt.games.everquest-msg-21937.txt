AE bad.  Say it with me no.  AE bad.  OK< its not always true, judicious
use of AE spells is quite viable... but even though I spend most of my
life outdoors I"ve been inside enough to have developed an ingrained
aversion to anyone casting a spell that can drag in adds and trains from
three floors down, or thru the walls, or who knows where the pathing
is going to put effects.  AE heals and buffs are fine, as they only affect
group members... but other than that, well I"m already wondering why
I memmed DA instead of Gate when I hear you mention one.

Level Five, extremely low mana cost, really fast, does no damage, lasts plenty
long enough to get mes cast or root cast or to just run far enough away to
make escape an option or give tanks time to taunt... Is there a finer spell?
I used Stun and Flash of Light both till into my 40s, flash isn't on the list
all that much anymore, but Stun sure is.
