No you mostly just missed the point.

So after you do 10 of something, you have to do 10 of somehting else. 
Are you complaining? /smack!! I can't see why... that's a godsend. 
That's exactly the sort of variety we DONT have and do crave.

10 repetitions << 400 repetitions

We're not talking total time. We're talking *repetitions*. 

Would you be happy if they got rid of all the raid progression and put 
all your drops on one mob in one event and then just told you to repeat 
it 400 times? Welcome to LDoN and now DoN.

Doing 10 X, 10 Y, 10 Z, 10 Q... even if it adds up to 400 or even more 
is still infinitely preferable to just doing 400 X.

I'm sorry you have to go back and get that Xegeny key again every couple 
weeks because some rogue leaves your guild; it must really suck to have 
to take a break from doing new stuff and go back and do something you've 
already done a couple dozen or so times before. 

We can't imagine how that feels... we haven't got any new stuff to take 
a break from. We beat our first DoN missions months ago, and we're still 
grinding out our 400 repetitions of the exact same mission.

Enjoy your progression, we can only imagine what it would be like to do 
a DoN 10 times and then have something other than 390 more to do after 
that. Those of use who've been around for a long time can at least 
vaguly remember the game pre-Pop when our various 1-groupable upgrades 
were at least scattered around instead of all being in one place. 

Sure I'm exaggerating slightly... but LDoN and DoN are *that* 
monotonous.
