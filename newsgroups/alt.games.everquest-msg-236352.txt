I stand corrected. It always confuses me when idiot assholes like you
complain about other's behavior, until I remember that half your reason for
being the way you are is to get attention. Can't stand out in a herd of
assholes, so you need the rest of em to go away.

I'll say it as simple as I can so maybe you'll understand. You're a dick,
you shouldn't complain about other dicks. It's hypocrisy. Damn, that word
might be too complicated for you. Oh well, you've got all day to figure it
out. Try www.dictionary.com, maybe that will help.
