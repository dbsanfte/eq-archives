True, you need to find the guild that fits you and there is one out
there some where.

They vary from hardly a raid to uber guild about every night a raid.
They can be very family oriented people who help each other out to the
uber end guild who can be very anal about controlling who gets what
drop and what they expect out of you to deserve to get that drop.

Your milage will very on guilds so if you don't like it move on.

In our guild we are upper level, but hardly uber (dragons are a
struggle) and we have people who come in level up with us, have no
problem using the guild to get equipped and leveled, and then run over
to the uber guild as soon as they make the requirements for it,
instead of sticking around and helping the guild to grow. So leaving a
guild your not happy with isn't a problem but if it's a good  guild
with good people, you'll stick around anyways, even if the defectors
set the guild back a few months. A guild with members mostly of good
character is can be as fun to be around in EQ as raiding is.
