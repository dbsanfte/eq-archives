I have no problem with casters that want to melee a little, its no
big deal if we are all grinding away and you said you had full mana.
Swing away I say if nothing other than to keep from being bored.
However, don't delude yourself into thinking you are even as effective
as 1/4 a meleer. Your weapon skill(even maxed out at the cap) as well as your
lack of DW and DA will not be effective enough.
I'd be very surprised if you did 1/10 as much as a meleeer.
Yes you have decent AC and that's good but your dodge is capped
at 75 and you don't have parry or riposte either.

How long is the stun? How often does it proc? Is it resisted a lot?
