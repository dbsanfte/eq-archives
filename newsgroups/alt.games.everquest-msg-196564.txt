Something I havent seen mentioned is that they increased cast time
(not sure when we never seem to know that) for songs to about 4
seconds not 3. Thus its impossible NOW to twist 5 but in the past it
was very doable. Yeah gonna get some arguement on this but Ive timed
it and its so close to 4 seconds as to be no matter, ping runs around
180 to 300 but that has no real effect on casting itself.
