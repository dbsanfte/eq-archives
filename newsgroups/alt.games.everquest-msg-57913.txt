From their site.
--------------------------------------------------------
WE ARE BACK!

After a few days in the netherworld we have returned.
As previously stated we were having our servers moved and someone forgot to turn one back on, being the weekend and all it took a
while to get fixed. But here we are, and thanks for your patience.

You may notice the site being slower right now, we are currently discussing with our hosts about the amount of bandwidth they can
supply us and will try to get the site back to speed as soon as possible.

Thanks once again for your continued support for us here at Casters Realm.
