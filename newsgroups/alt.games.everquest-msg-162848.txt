Well, 61 and 62 spells seem to appear with equal freqency on the turn in, and
are both off the same drop frequency table.  Point would be in favor of the 63
necro, though, who could figure to get his 63 spell trading to a cleric or
paladin even up.

Two root spells?  Can I be reading this right?  Oh, yeah, I forgot, I already
have at least 4 roots.  Sure, give me a couple more of them.  Heck, go for broke
make it 8 I can mem nothing but roots!

At any rate, not a 63, as I suspected.

Again, no good to me yet.  Something to look forward to getting when I finally
DO get a spectral Parchment, I have a shot at getting a 61 spell!

Ah, of course, I'll probably get leftover shadow parchment drops from all my 65
necro friends.

you say 63, I say 64... same parchment same shot at getting it I'm guessing.
And of no use to me at 63 anyway.

Excellent, now when I get a Shadow parchment it will undoubtably yeild me a nice
Ethereal Parchment spell as well, just like the Spectral ones will.

Yep, this really takes care of my level 63 blues.
