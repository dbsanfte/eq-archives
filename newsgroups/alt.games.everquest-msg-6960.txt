Using right-click (from a main inventory slot, like drinking booze)
you can also "force-feed" yourself some other food (muffins, etc.)
to the point of "can't eat any more" just before you swap your
"stat" food to your "next to eat" slot.  This will put off the
time until you finally eat one of your stat foods.  And if
you remember to force-feed yourself back up to bursting every
once in a while, you can gain the benefit of a stat food
indefinitely, without ever actually eating it.
