What about when someone in the group asks you to share the loot, when you
wait for at least a minute and loot the stuff that no one else has bothered
to try to pick up, and the only one complaining is the one standing in front
of the not bothered corpse for the minute until you loot it, which pisses
them off because you didn't let them loot it (just gave a reasonable amount
of time to allow them to loot had they really wanted to, even a few step
forward to it, then back, then up again to show you intend to loot if they
don't want to).

And for the grammar police...I know that was one really long run-on sentence
which I've always been pretty bad about writing without leaving any breaks,
or using way too many commas, or using commas in place of periods.
