Untwinked, they are one of the weaker classes at the very early levels

> Post-17 and before FD and mend hit 100+, they die even less.

I used 1 point in each special attack, defence etc, and saved every other
single point for FD/ID, even with a shitload of points in FD it was a
worthless skill for a few levels (if its not reliable, your surely not going
to risk a dodgy gamble)

I remember the first time I found out memblur/FD changed on 35+ mobs... I
was in OT and a goon agrod.. I ran a lil, FD'd, failed, FD'd.. phew.  There
was me thinking for once I'd got away from a goon.. so I waited a while for
it to leave, then I stood up and walked back to my group, 5 seconds later it
came running behind me and killed me :(

Or when, with a 200 FD skill
You have fallen to the floor
You have fallen to the floor
You have fallen to the floor

aww shit.. happened to me last night in Kael heh

> Monks just don't have the HPs or total AC to survive a failed FD when

My monk guildleader has broken 6k HP on a recent nToV clearing /drool

I think the biggest hitters I deal with on pulls (the most troublesome, not
necessarily biggest dmg) is when pulling Tormax's guards.  Theres a mob in
there that sows them all, and on some pulls I get the mob just inside agro
range of the guild, and FD with <100 hp left (after mending)
