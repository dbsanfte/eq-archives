Live-action; the players dress up in costumes ranging from
pattern-print shirts to full-blown robes, leather, chainmale, plate,
etc, and often use foam, PVC piping wrapped in foam padding, toy
replicas, and for seriously extreme groups like the SCA, actual wepons.
 Like paper-n-dice and computer RPG's, there's a number of rules
systems available that govern play, character creation, leveling, etc.
I used to play the NERO (North East Roleplaying Organization) system,
myself, but have not been able to get out to play in years.  My local
NERO chapter (NERO West, Santa Cruz area) folded years ago, then was
revived a couple of years ago.  It was at the same time the DotCom
bubble burst, and as I was a good long while out of work, I was in no
way ready to plonk down for the membership fees :) (covering things
like insurance, rental fees for the campgrounds used, equipment costs,
etc).

Loads of fun, but defenitely not for everyone.
