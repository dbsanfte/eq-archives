You asked how someone could get to level 50 without seeing every zone
in Antonica at least once, I gave an example.
Oh, and my secondary is an evil character. She will soon know Neriak
like the back of her blue hand and I expect to take her to Grobb/Oggok
in a few levels.
Curious about the sewers in Freeport/Qeynos? Not really, no.

You can also guess how many zones she HAS been to, if you're worried
about me missing out on content because I don't go everywhere and hunt
everything.
