Might be able to goranga gatherers in ME near the dsp zone. They are a
little tougher than scorae hornets. Lots of high level kos stuff about tho,
so take care. If you camp just south of the dsp zoneline you should avoid
most of the trains. Too many people camp in the tunnel and then complain
about trains.
