Predictions:

There will be recipes added to tailoring to fill the gap between 158 and
250+, the recipe will require at least 1 rare drop and likely a level 2 mana
vial (cloudy mana, requires peridot, lvl 20, no current use)

There will be Val'Shir cultural tailoring (doubtful blacksmithing, as they
appear more leather based)

Fletching will get a few more bows, but they will be considered generally
useless next to mob-dropped bows.

Cultural Blacksmithing pieces will have minor upgrades to bring in line with
difficulty.

Baking will get a plethora of new foods.  Perhaps a few nice stat enhancers.

Brewing may get some Cat style drinks

Jewelcraft will likely not see improvement.  There is rumored to be an
Enchant: Luclinite spell, but it will probably be for making Studs/Boning
for the Val'Shir cultural armors.

Pottery, doubt we'll see anything here, unless we get something to make with
enchant: clay other then idols


These are my predictions only.  I have no access to beta or any other inside
information in any way.
