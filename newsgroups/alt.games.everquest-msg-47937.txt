cool, i did all this and now my isdn card, my sound card and my video card
are all on their own irq

havent tested in eq yet, but i think this will do the trick

i was wondering thought, is there a way to have acpi enabled but to have the
3 cards on 3 different irq s using BIOS

i remeber assigning irq s in bios years ago using tweak.net or something but
cant seem to find it on net now

thanks for help
