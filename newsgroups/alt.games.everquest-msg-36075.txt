Some skills like a ranger's "kick" for example only advance if you use them.
You know how you have buttons like socials and abilities? Things like
/consider and sense heading?

There is no "Kick" button that you can press or chose as an option until you
put one point into it. It then appears on the menu when you click combat and
a blank button.

Likewise some skills are nothing short of painful to raise from zero. I
think I actually got my wizard to 1 meditation by clicking the meditate
button 3 or 4 million times. I could be wrong on this, the process knocked
about 80 points off my IQ and I am still in a stupor from it. I don't do
that anymore. I head straight to my guildmaster and put one point into
meditation after only 2,000 to 3,000 clicks to make sure there hasn't been a
miracle since the last time I played and gaining several levels. Who'da
thunk if my ranger didn't get meditate until 10 or 12, that an enchanter
would get it at 4.
