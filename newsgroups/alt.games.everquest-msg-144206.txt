Have not, but I did, out of curiosity, sign up for it and get the email
about it.  I took a look at the email, and, although he ranted way too much
about it, the guy who started the other thread regarding it has a point.  In
the email, unless you look at it in plain text, or highlight it, you will
never see the requirement for things like a credit card.  This seems kind of
stupid to me.  You make someone believe they will have free access for 30
days, get them to do this humongous download, then they find out after the
fact about the credit card requirement.  Admittedly, 9 times out of 10, it
won't be an issue, but why hide it.  The text appears to be black text on a
black background.  If you happen to think to highlight the message, you will
see the text saying a credit card is required.  Just seemed pretty stupid to
me.  There was other black on black text in there, but I didn't look at it
all in detail.
