it will take alot, but you can i believe do the bread quest to raise
ogguk factions.  take bread from the centaur village in SK, to innkeeper
glub (sp) who is close to the bridge in Feerrott.  You will get faction
with merchants, guards and Clurg, and possibly with the shadowknights. 
Once you are dubious to sk, you can turn in lizard tails, 4 at a time
for faction with the shadowknights.  I got frustrated not being able to
find a stein of moggok for sale on Erollisi marr for my necro to buy, so
my druid did this quest, and as of last night, my druid is now able to
walk unmolested by the guards.  I have yet to check the shadowknights. 
I know I am still kos to the Warrior guild as I am dubious in wolf form,
and am kos to the shaman guild, and have found no way to raise that.  I
know they nerfed the experience on the bread quest for FV/SZ, but not
sure if they removed it all together or not.
