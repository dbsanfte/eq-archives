*giggle* would this be a lousy time to confess I had no idea you were 
you?  I recognized you as being in there often but after chatting with 
you last time I logged off, read AGE and went "OMG, it's MARTIN I've 
been talking to!"  I probably should have clued in with the "on my 
monk" comments, but eh... I was too busy taking down big mean yellow 
things and chortling with glee because I was still at full mana.  Mmmmm, 
KEI.

Ryou
(wonders if Tea will keep up on that offer to PL her a chanter, and if 
she'll be pissed when I move that chanter to, oh, EMarr...)
