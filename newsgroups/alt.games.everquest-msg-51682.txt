But it's nice to have a bash skill above 3 for those times when you
need to interrupt something. So, after she gets dual wield, my warrior
will be swapping in her parrying dagger for the occasional bash just
to keep skill up, and if I get my hands on some lightweight magic
shield such as velium round shield, I'll replace the parrying dagger
with that. You *have* heard of swapping in a shield momentarily during
combat in order to bash, right?
(Heck, since it's a dagger she could keep it permanently equipped in
groups and nobody would realize she wasn't dual wielding unless they
noticed her bash animation :) )
