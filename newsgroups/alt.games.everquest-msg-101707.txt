    Or the observer does something stupid. That's the first fear, that
whoever is there is going to do something so mind-numbingly dense that the
raid will be impacted. "Whoops, adds!" We had a bunch of recruits last night
at the Creator fight. How many times do you think we told people to not go
near the back door, and not open it? What do you suppose ended up wiping us?
I like how the guildmaster explained things afterwards in the raid channel:
"This time we will succeed, because NOBODY WILL GO NEAR THE BACK DOOR."

    Sentinel was intended to be an alarm spell for medding casters. Cast
Sentinel, and if anything gets in range it gets lit up by the same spell
effect as a mez and there's a warning message that gets spammed. Works for
PCs, too, which is the problem. Casting Sentinel on the crowd in the EC
Tunnel used to be a good way to thin the crowd - imagine the spam from 50
people all setting off messages and being lit up by a particle effect, over
and over.

    We've seen the Tormax head and the 10th ring war head get ninja'ed.
Lodizal is much more likely to get stolen outright, rather than ninja'ed -
I've even heard of a second raid chain-Annuling Lodizal so the first raid
would get eaten by him. But I have seen the map piece being ninja'ed off
Lodizal. And yup, all three people in these cases had reps.

    It's very much like real life. If someone was following you around for
no discernable reason, would you feel threatened? Would you feel harassed if
the person, when asked to stop following you, refused and continued to
follow?

    But how else can someone scout your strats? :-)

    The worst "stalkers" we ever had were at our last NToV clearing. An old
first-tier guild has been reforming after disbanding when DAoC came out, and
they've been playing by the old ways. For example, one of their monks
dropped Klandicar on us when we were killing Myga for one of our sorcerors.
Other guilds have had even worse problems with them. Well, they got to NToV
first when it popped during "our" week in our two (now three, but not with
these clowns) guild rotation. They cleared to Eashen, pulled him, got wiped.
Our guildleader called a GM, showed the GM how they were only able to get
their corpses without a summon from zone-in because we'd cleared the way
again, and asked the GM if we could have a shot at Eashen since the other
side had wiped. GM said yes, and left.

    We got trained twice by that other guild before we finally dispatched
Eashen and the trains. Then we noticed that they were still hanging around.
When asked if they would leave, their guildmaster said, "No. We're waiting
for you to clear Aaryonar. Once you do, whichever fork you don't take we
will." So we left, they ported out five minutes later (as they can't dent
Aary), and we cleared NToV the next day. They've since sent people to just
about every one of our raids they can get to in order to (no doubt) scout
how we do things. Sigh.

    There's one server GM that likes to watch us when we raid, as we have a
reputation for being squeeky clean in terms of exploits/friction with other
guilds. Since he started hanging around, we haven't had a single ninja issue
and fewer trainings. Our second attempt at AoW, I kid you not, our shout of
"Inc. AoW" was immediately followed by an ooc of "train to zone" - right at
us. No more of that now. :-)
