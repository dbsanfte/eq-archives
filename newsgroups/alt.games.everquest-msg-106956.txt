Of course, to a certain extent, perceptions as to what is a strength
and what is a weakness will vary.  Soloing is, to many people, a big
bonus for a class.  

And, just so I'm not perpetrating any untruths here, druids are VERY
group friendly for the first 50 levels or so.  Post 50 they're STILL
nice to have in a exp grind group.  Raid level groups don't usually
NEED a druid along, which is what started this whole petition thing.

Norrath is a big place.  If you're not moving around, you're missing a
lot of the game.  Not to mention that I've seen enchanters and clerics
sometimes not even be able to find a group in DL.  Granted, this is
late at night, and uncommon, but it still happens.  And when it does,
they can't as easily just head over to Velious to see what is up
there, or just pop over to the old world at the drop of a hat to help
guildies in Sol B or Lower Guk.

It is a bonus to a lot of people.  If people didn't want 'easy' games,
cheat codes wouldn't be an almost required feature in the vast
majority of games made today.

Next.
