I started to write an answer to try to help you, but reading the
question, and even more so the subject line, again, I realized I have no
clue what you are asking for? Are you trying to get the names and stats
of all the epics themselves for all the classes? Or all the items you
need to collect on the path to getting all the epics? Or just all the
items need for the wizard epic?


If it's the last one, go to http://www.graffe.com/ and click on the
quest link in the left nave. There is information on all the major
wizard quests, including the epic. Also, in the discussion forum there,
you will find sections for discussion of each of the quests and can ask
questions if the information you are looking for is not there. Most of
the classes have a "home page" type site where you can find epic
information as well. I won't even try to list them all here, but it's in
the newsgroup's FAQ.
