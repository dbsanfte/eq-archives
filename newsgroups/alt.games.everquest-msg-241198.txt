    I'm glad you called them players instead of calling them your friends.  I
can't say that I've ever had any one mock me for my gear.  If I did, they would
find themselves on /ignore pretty damned fast.  I like having nice gear the same
as everyone else, of course, but I really don't make it my life's mission to
acquire it.  If someone else does well then goody for them, but it doesn't mean
that they are better than me for having done so.
