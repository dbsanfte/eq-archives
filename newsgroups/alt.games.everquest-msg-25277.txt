If you have Kunark, then getting to BB is not difficult at all without going
through Freeport.  Hop the raft from Oasis to Ogre Island, then you have two
choices, swim to the pots, and tp to the city of your choice (Cabilis, or
old world cities), or swim over and intercept the ship from FV to BB.  Learn
to live within your limitations.  If you can't live within those
limitations, then why on earth are you playing that character?
