    Every other focus that involves a non-time component works in this
manner. I agree that it's premature to criticize based on it, but there's a
good chance that's how it will work. If it doesn't, look for the unfounded
whining to start from the nukers: "My damage focus doesn't always give the
best result! His DoT focus does, a melee's haste item does! This is BS!"

    It was never intended that they be affected by it. It was a nice bug
while it lasted, and maybe they should revisit the situation and make foci
that extend debuff durations. But it wasn't supposed to work that way.

    The change from Extended to Burning Affliction is supposed to be an
enhancement for the classes that use DoTs. If it isn't an enhancement, those
classes have every right to complain to get it changed until it is an
enhancement.
