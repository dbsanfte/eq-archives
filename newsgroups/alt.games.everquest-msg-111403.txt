That was the sickle, I believe.  I loved the sickle in AD&D...my favorite
druid weapon.  I wish EQ had sickles. :(  

They have this silly quest in kelethin about turning in rusty blades to
the druid guild. I don't remember the text, but the NPC basically says
"swords are EVIL, get them out of this world...but, uh...them curvy ones
are A-OK".  I've been dubious about the minds of wood elves ever since...

Seriously, though, can you imagine trying to prune your shrubs, or roses,
with a scimitar?  Sickle I can picture...a little (give me sharp pruning
shears anyday).  But take a scimitar to a bush and .... oops, there go my
roses. *giggle*
