Apparently we're not the only ones.  My wife's Canadian,
and after visiting her relatives "back home" last time,
she was returning through Customs (on the US side), and
they asked her if she had any food or drink to declare.

She said, "just a case of candy bars", and the Customs
agent looked at her, raised an eyebrow, and asked,
"Coffee Crisp?"

Good guess.
