    I hate to parrot the devs for EQ, but as they say: the difficulty is
what makes an achievement meaningful. Some of the difficult parts of EQ
really are just pure annoyance, but others contribute to the game being
enjoyable.

    You forgot how most of the items you require are mob drops, so one can't
be a pure tradeskiller (unless you're also an EC master trader), and how the
products rarely compete with mob drops insofar as quality is concerned.

    That's a design limitation. In EQ, one can have undiscovered recipes, or
recipes only found on a dusty scroll in Mistmoore (Ornate chain). Players
can experiment to discover these recipes. It brings together a community of
tradeskillers, as EQTraders demonstrates. When the Root Beer Float was
recently discovered, they had a big cheer. 8)

    In DAoC, everything is given to you. No undiscovered recipes. No
mob-drop tradeskill items, or seeing an item drop off a mob and wondering
"what is that for?" That takes a lot of the drive out of the game to
discover.

    That sounds like an improvement I hope EQ steals. 8)

    I find the time delay for attempting an item to be pretty artificial.
They make all those improvements to the UI to make things easy on players,
then put a pure time sink in.

    That "random quest" feature sounds awesome. Another thing I wish EQ had.
Especially since the items the task giver would ask for could give clues as
to what items are in-game. 8) In being random it even defeats the players
that repeat a high reward/risk quest ad nauseum.

    Given the quality differences there, it sounds like killing mobs is more
the chore you need to do to finance tradeskills.

    That sounds nice for highlighted text. What about unhighlighted text,
"hidden" quests that NPCs have? Can you just ramble to an NPC, or are all
the responses of the click nature?

    Also makes them a lot more cookie-cutter. For some of the epics (as a
recent example), figuring out who to go to and what to say to them was part
of the challenge. What challenge is there now? In EQ, a new quest takes some
work to figure out. I imagine DAoC quests will be much more obvious.

    All eight of us can get the hobgoblin's head? Interesting. 8) You forgot
to mention how quests are only given out at certain levels, and how one can
only have so many quests in one's quest log. So I guess if you do a lot for
one city's residents, the next city's folk won't like you so much. Heh -
except I ALSO gather there's no faction in DAoC, just "likes you" and "KOS".
Another roleplaying opportunity lost.

    So until the N minutes expires, or you type /release, you just hang
around staring at where you died? Can you talk, send /tells to try and GET a
res? Or just hope a cleric was in your group / wandering by? As an EQ cleric
I'm curious about this aspect of the game.

    It's my understanding that the XP lost via /release is equal to the
immediate XP loss on death. So death would have three possible XP penalties:
ressed in time, 0 loss. Release and /pray, 50% of possible loss. Release and
don't pray, 100% of total loss. Is that accurate?

>6. The XP loss is cut back if you aren't far into the level, so that
>you cannot lose a level.

    Is the XP from praying equal to the actual XP lost from /release, then?
So players can't exploit dying and /praying when just into a level? If so,
is the XP loss equally portioned between "lost" XP and /pray XP, so that
there's always a reason to go /pray? Hypothetical that prompts that: I die,
lose all XP since I gained level Y, then /release (losing no further XP). So
I don't need to go /pray, as I'll get nothing back.

    At what level can clerics (or whoever resses) res, anyways?

    I'm hoping EQ steals any idea worth stealing from DAoC. 8)
