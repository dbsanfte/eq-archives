I dont know any home ISP that doesnt require you to be aware of netiquette
and provide you with all the information needed to find it. Its in the ToS
of pretty much everyone. If you chose not to read that bulky legal speak
they make everyone sign or click then thats you fault.

If you are on a work ISP then its almost certainly buried in the contract
somewhere (if only to cover the ISP from contributory lawsuits) but you
are far less likely to have been handed the right piece of paper.

Go looking in your ToS and your ISPs webpage - if you cant find it while
looking for it slap them and tell them to make it more obvious.
