Any ideas where a 70 monk who is bazaar geared and has only 32 AA might 
attempt to solo effectively for xp? I'd enjoy doing a little of this off 
hours but am not sure where most ideal place/places might be. I did get him 
the first 3 ranks of the avoidance AA and the 1st rank of the mitigation but 
thats it. I notice he seems to stand up to the light blues in HoH pretty 
well now and might see if that works without too much downtime. He is back 
to 100% regular xp leveling for now as I think he gets more bang for the 
buck there and can flesh out AA later.
