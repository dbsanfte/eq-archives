Actually, that's not true... try /follow-ing a char with higher agility than
you... eventually, he'll get beyond the range of /follow.
My Druid (buffed AGL 104) was 'towing' my lowbie Monk (AGL 100... he's
geared for STR and DEX) across SK from the Stone Bridge to Aviak town... the
Monk dropped from /follow range just before reaching the Gnoll Spires.

AGL is the stat your move speed is based on. :o)
