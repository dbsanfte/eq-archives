Hello all,

  I play on the Drinal server and finally ventured into Befallen.  What a
madhouse!  It took me a couple days to learn how to not die only about 100
feet in (hehe) and was really beginning to enjoy grouping against Dark
Followers and Scarred Initiates, etc.  Taking my Necro against other casters
and pets was cool...
  Then the patch struck.
  Now it seems I could easily solo there without a pet at all.  Nothing but
Skeletons and Plague Rats.  What's the deal?  Was it nerfed on purpose?  Is
it a GM event possibly?  And was Befallen nerfed on other servers?
  Any answer would be greatly appreciated.
  Also, can anyone recommend a good place for a level 16 Necro to hunt now
that Befallen has been wrecked?

TIA,
Sharad
