Given that I have no mana preservation items, does not help me any.  I 
have only cast Stoicism twice, both times I got the advertised 640hp heal 
out of it I believe.  No question Torpor or Quiescense are far better 
ratios, not even counting any items, I just don't have those spells.

I'll try a test of stoicism, and see what it looks like.

Research components drop in many other zones.  The General in OT has 
dropped a couple research components for me, not sure what level off 
hand, I think he's level 58 exactly.
