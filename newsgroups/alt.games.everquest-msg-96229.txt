Having hunted about a bit more there seems to be one unconfirmed comment
on a safehouse thread about the new hybrid classes. Saying that they
have removed hell levels so I would take this change with a huge pinch
of salt atm.

On the other hand the third anerversary anouncment seems to confirm that
there are major changes afoot for the patch next week (19th).
