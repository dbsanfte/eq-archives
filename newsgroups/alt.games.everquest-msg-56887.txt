Hi All,

I'm a Tunare-worshipping Human Druid. I inadvertently ruined my Tunare
faction by going on a PoG raid and sowing/buffing the raiders. Even though I
wasn't grouped, and did not cast during a fight, somehow my faction got
hosed. Some folks think it's because I cast Chloro, which stays 'active'
during fighting. Some folks say it was because I helped drag corpses.

Anyway, the Protectors still like me (they are on a different faction), but
Tunare and all the other Mobs hate me.

I cannot shop in the Druid Guild in Kelethin.

I have been doing the WL quests, which has raised my faction from dubious to
indiff with the 'Court of Tunare' faction. Apparently that is not good
enough to raise PoG faction.

I want my goddess to love me again!

Any ideas?

Drywit 54 Druid Erollisi Marr
