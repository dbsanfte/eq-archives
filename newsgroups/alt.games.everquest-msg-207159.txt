His post, and a combination of giving him the benefit of the doubt and my
distain at your not doing so yourself.  Where is your evidence that the
original poster is an ungrateful societal freeloader?

Humans of course have different behaviors and attitudes.  Human nature,
though, is by its very definition, that which is common among us.

I have to admit, I was sticking up for the original poster because, 1) the
fact that you obviously feigned amazement to hijack this thread in an
attempt to make a "real world" point of your own, and 2) what you were
amazed at was the way a poster was *playing a game* as if these virtual
electronic 0's and 1's were items in the real world.  I might just as well
respond to a post about someone hunting guards for faction and wax sadly
that society is falling apart and life is no longer sacred.

And I am ashamed to say that I accidentally forgot to tell Horatio what
originally drew me to this thread.  You've rekindled very fond memories in
me of making the same trip the other direction with my bard, and even before
that the adventure of my enchanter (who moved much slower) going to Highkeep
for his first animation spell that wasn't available in his guild.
Congratulations; you will never forget that trip.  Here's hoping your
character has many more adventures!

Regards,
Mort
