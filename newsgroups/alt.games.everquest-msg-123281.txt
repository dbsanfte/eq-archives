As far as I know, that is it for proper silk collection. The same spiders
are in Firiona Vie as Dreadlands.

If you want to farm easily, there's also the heart spiders in Upper Guk, but
camping for XP is more fun.

The other spiders that spring to mind to hunt in the 30s are the crystalline
spiders in CC... but they drop a different kind of silk.
