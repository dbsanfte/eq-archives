Unrest.  Yard trash.  Beware of trains.  Get bound just inside
the GFay zone near BB (this is actually closer than being bound
in Kaladim).

About the only other option is to grab the boat to Antonica,
which is what I did.  *Many* more hunting options available at
your level.

On the other hand, every Paladin should live for a while in
Unrest.
