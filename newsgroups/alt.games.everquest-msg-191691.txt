The US definitely still has positive population growth (immigration 
contributes about 2/5 of this). I think only a handful of countries in 
Europe (Spain and Italy for certain, perhaps Russia too) and probably 
Japan have fertility that falls under population replacement rates. In 
the case of Spain (and probably Italy too), this is widely offset by 
immigration.
