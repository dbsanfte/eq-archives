>/auction WTT 2 HQ Bear and 1 HQ Wolf Pelts for a port to Misty Thicket plz!

You know, that's a DAMN good deal for the porter. The HQ wolf pelt's
only good for practice, but the HQ bears are worth anywhere from
40-70p total. A good tailor can make a couple backpacks out of them
and sell them for around 100p each. All for a 29th level port.
