Yaniel,
No flames, but some constructive criticism.

Enchanters are the lords of crowd control.  That doesn't mean that  you will
never get hit; everyone gets resisted sometimes.  Remember that you have
ways of decreasing the damage  you take, from such spells as the Rune and
Uproar lines.  Enchanters have more spells, and more types of spells, than
anyone else.  Discover what ALL of them do - while some of them have very
limited application, I have yet to find a spell that is 'useless.'  (Yes,
even Sentinel.)

Enchanters can solo, but they are at their best in a group.  The reason is
simple; enchanters have the ability to make every class more effective at
what they do.  If you use your buffs only on yourself and your pet, you're
enchancing two characters.  Join a group and enchance all of them, and you
enhance six (seven if you keep a pet).  Both safety and efficiency are
multiplied.

Be sure to keep both of your stuns loaded - you should have two at your
level.  If you're soloing, after the mob you're fighting is slowed you can
further reduce the damage you take by casting those two stuns as fast as
they cycle ('chainstunning').  If you're in a group, you can interrupt a
mob's casting by standing close (but not in the fight) and firing off a stun
when the mob starts to cast.  This should work for you efficiently up to
level 55 mobs.

Spend as much time grouping as you can.  As you go up in levels, your
soloing opportunities will become more and more limited but your grouping
opportunities widen.  After healers, no class is more desired in a group
than an enchanter, even in these days of KEI.  Learn the skills that come
with grouping; learn how to work with every other class.  It's been said
that your most important stat is your reputation.

The last point I'll emphasize is dungeon work.  You're in CC now, and that's
good.  Work in dungeons as often as possible; the XP is better and it's
much, much harder than outdoor work.  I can tell if an enchanter grew up in
dungeons or outdoors within ten minutes of grouping with them on my wizard
or bard - a dungeon-skilled enchanter is more aware of surroundings, is
faster on mezzes and stuns, and knows their full range of spells.  Overall,
far superior.
