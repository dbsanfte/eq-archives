You seem caught in the old thinking that there is a right way to make a
game and a wrong way.  Personally I am hoping future developers step
away from that thinking and make their game the way they want it to be,
then market it as such.  Not a game for everyone, but a game for folks
who like that type of game.  Easy relaxing games for folks who want
that, insanely difficult games with huge penalties for failure for folks
who want that.  (guess which group I'm in yet? <g>)

I can assure  you that if Brad had made the game he used to talk about
making when he was making EQ a large percentage of folks playing now
would either never have bought it or quit soon after.  It also would
have been a much better game, at least from the perspective of hard core
gamers.  There lies the problem.  Do you  maximize profit by maximizing
subscriptions, or do you make a good game?  The game which seeks to
gather the largest player base can  not have features which exclude
users, whereas a good game by its very nature will deter those unable to
play it due to laziness or stupidity.  The death of The Vision was
pandering to the lazy and the stupid.  Good for the bottom line though
hehe, them folks are plentiful.  

Now if someone would just make a game for folks who want a real
challenge and won't whine about it when they get it.  The problem is
that the games so far have aimed low and done so well it would be very
hard to find financial support for a game which aimed from the start to
exclude a large segment of the population with money to spend.
