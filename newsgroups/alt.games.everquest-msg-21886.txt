Hold it there. Yes, the accounts are 3rd party. VI puts out the game.
SOE provides the servers. While it's true that VI is owned by SOE,
they are still not the same party. It's also true that VI maintains
the servers SOE provides, but the service is still through SOE and not
VI.

At any rate, to be blunt, the argument that the account and game are
the "same item" is bullshit.
