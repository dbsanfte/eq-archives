I'm not certain, but I know it is far worse at higher LVs.  I've heard a
death on some levels can cost 10+ or even 20 hours of play time.  Although I
still think, no matter how large or small the EXP loss penalty is, dieing
and losing your LV is bad enough, and would be ultimate worst at LV60 (reach
LV60, die, welcome back to LV59).  Oh well, at least (or I hope) Verant
didn't put in a message such as "You hit LV60, then died and lost your
level. Welcome back to LV59...don't you feel stupid?"

Anybody know (or know from experience) what happens when you reach the end
of LV60?  Does your EXP bar just sit there at full (5 orange bubbles and 5
blue bubbles) or does it reset but keep track so in a way its like having a
6th or 7th and more bubbles at LV60?

What did it do at LV50 when that was the cap?  Same thing as 60?  And when
LV50 was the cap, those who hit the end and went farther did they
automatically log in as LV51 or their next kill no matter how little (as
long as some) EXP put them to 51?  Or did the exact number of EXP keep being
kept track of so it would theoretically be possible to have jumped from LV50
to LV52 (assuming you had enough TOTAL EXP)?

Anyone though of how many deaths it would take once hitting LV60 to get to
the point where you no longer lose EXP (LV4 or 3)?

At higher LVs does anybody ever suicide as often just for fun, such as
jumping down the pit in paneel (sp?) or off of high platforms to see how
much damage they take?

Personally I kind of like playing a character still in newbie stages.  That
way you can play around more with no penalty.  Like finding the tallest area
and seeing how much damage you can take or how far out you can fall or how
far from home you can run with 1 copper piece on your naked LV1 body (got to
have something to leave a corpse for a little while).
