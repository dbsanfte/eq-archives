Heh, you didn't miss a patch, you missed a fan faire.  Someone at Verant 
said that what -really- happens is that only the highest of int, wis, and 
str is checked.  Never mind that that contradicts what they said 4 fan 
faires ago...

Opinion on the forums at eqtraders seems somewhat divided among those who 
care.  Most people are just saying it's highest of the three, because 
it's easier, but some people insist on pulling up very real-sounding data 
to support it being the way you described it still.  

In my opinion, it makes no real difference which theory is correct.
