** Patching **

Yesterday's patch definitely won't be one to go down in EQ history as a 
shining example of Our Finest Hour.

The problems that occurred yesterday afternoon and evening, including 
teleportations to bind points that were accompanied by a client string 
being displayed at random, are all taken care of.

All of the seemingly disconnected problems were the result of a single 
bug in EverQuest's communications layer that only reared its head on 
servers that had maintained a certain population for a certain amount of 
time.  Unfortunately, this doesn't occur as frequently as we'd like on 
our Test Server, where the effects of this bug never occurred.

As always, for those looking for a change, we'd like to once again 
extend the offer to give the Test Server a try if you're looking for 
something different.  If you're ever interested, please exit and run 
TestEverQuest.exe inside your EverQuest directory.

The Test Server is a small community of some of the nicest, most 
dedicated folks you'll find, and many have eventually called it their 
home.  If you miss the "small world" feeling of EverQuest, it might be 
just the thing for you.

(One disclaimer: Test Server does not have full-time Customer Service 
coverage.  Its primary purpose remains for the development and testing 
of ongoing changes to EverQuest.  It does get updated much more 
frequently than the live servers, but all potential changes show up 
there first.)

Thanks very much for your patience, and we do apologize to those who 
were affected yesterday.

- The EverQuest Development Team
