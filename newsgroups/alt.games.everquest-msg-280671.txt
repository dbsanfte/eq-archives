I doubt that the average playing time of aWoW player is less than that
of a EQ player,seeing rushing people to 60 in WoW in some weeks.
And I dont get your "hold his own in a fight" comment,its an online
game,fun comes from interacing with other players.
Its not that the game itself is worse than WoW,as mentioned it has
something to do how it is distributed and advertised for.Certainly
it was not very smart from SOE  to mark EQ as outdated by releasing a
game called EQ2.
And oh my god WoW was published in China *gasp*,I think its beyond
the horizon of SOE,that its even possible to make some money in China.
SOE managment is simply bad and shortsighted.
