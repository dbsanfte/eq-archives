Yep. :)  And if I can guess where you are going with this...that is a
possibility.  However, this much I know:

1) an uncounter that has been unlocked by a group will not give ANYONE xp
or loot until the original group has left the zone

So the question (which we don't know the answer to, or I don't know the
answer to), is can the encounter be locked by a new group before the mobs
have returned to full HP and power?  Given SOE's attitude on the rest of
it, my hunch tells me that another team can't have access to the loot or
xp of an encounter until the mobs are full reset.  BUt...that's merely
speculation.
