How would you have any way possible to even determine what the actual
figures were. This would be entirely subjective, if I solo a lot my
impression is theres a lot of sololing, if I always group the opposite
would hold.

Now if you ask which game encourages grouping though game mechanics
well that might be a bit more objective. So looking at that and
comparing EQ and AO since I know both well;

XP - Games that reduce significatly the xp a player recieves while
grouped vs solo for a single mob. For example EQs penalty is horrid
even with the tweeking done over the years. AO is great almost no
penalty what so ever. Forget kill rates here, higher is more xp per
mob ... AO 9.5 EQ 3.0

Kill rates - How much does the game reward grouping in reduced
downtime, faster kills ect. Higher is faster xp...AO 8.0 EQ 4.5

Loot options - Does the game allow you to set loot order, ect. Higher
is more options...AO 6.0 EQ 4.5

Finding a group - Does the game allow you to search effectivly for
other players. Higher is easier...EQ 7.0 AO 5.0

Lack of irreplacable classes - Nothing kills a group quicker than not
being able to function because someone leaves or cant be found. Higher
is fewer....AO 7.5 EQ 5.5

Difficulty of soloing. Amount of game content that solo is just not an
option. While not axactly a positive it none the less affects teaming.
Higher is harder..EQ 7.0 AO 4.0

By this AO is the more group friendly game however the ease of solo
may offset that. Given the xp factory that AO groups turn into make
this unlikely. 

Other factors for sure this was just an example it does not mean one
game is better than another since this is only one factor.
