This is my take- I am better off medding as much as possible, and
usually only get up when there are several mobs I can loot at once.
(More efficient)

Besides master looting, Monks could use the /split command. /split
0,0,x,y x being amount of silver, y being copper. You'll get a portion
of the coin back, but it splits all that coin with your groupmates. Let
them decide if they want to carry it or drop. I like my favorite rogue
who uses this command to share his pickpocket winnings with the group.
