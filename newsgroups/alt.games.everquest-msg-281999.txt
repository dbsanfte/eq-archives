So what you're suggesting is that since they're *avoiding* the law by being
located in another country, it's legal?

Or, for zero outlay, they can try one first.  I'm failing to see how buying
the software and playing on a server hosted in a foreign country to avoid
being shut down by Sony is a better option for a brand new player who's
never seen EQ, that getting a totally free download and playing on a
supported server.

Your mileage may vary.

Experienced players can better make that choice.  New players really should
give the official supported live game a go first, IMO.
