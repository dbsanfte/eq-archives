I think your druid could try the Wyverns in Cobalt Scar. I used to single
pull, and Root and Rot on the beach. I could usually find one Wyvern up,
even with all the Quad-Kiter's in the zone. The gems that drop sell okay in
the Bazaar, and can always be unloaded on a vender for good, quick plat.

If you have LoY you could try zone in area of Dulak. I've been doing that
recently at level 54 with my Druid. Good plat drops there, but a bit
dangerous.

My Enchanter is only level 38 and I usually group him, so I have no clue on
good solo spots for yours.

Good luck,
Naphtoe
