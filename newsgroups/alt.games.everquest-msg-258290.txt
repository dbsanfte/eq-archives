I didn't say always, I said very often.

I drive defensively whether its legal or not, for example when 
approaching an on ramp I tend to move into the left lane if its at all 
convenient to do so, even though this is an actual violation of PA state 
law, which states that the left lane is for passing only.

Right Turn on Red After Stop is an example of a "jungle" law that's made 
it into the driving laws of every state (I don't thing the DC ever 
passed it but thats not actually a state)

There are certainly plenty of examples of dangerous but common practices 
which are illegal, I tend to avoid those just as much as I do the 
dangerous practices which -are- legal but commonly not followed.

Here's a funny one though.

When I was attending FSU, an acquaintance did an interesting research 
paper; he searched thru the state police records showing speeds of 
people driving on I10 and speeds of those involved in traffic accidents 
on I10.

At the time, the legal limit was 55, however, it being a long straight 
road with very few on or off ramps and fairly light traffic, people 
tended to drive faster; in fact the average speed traveled was 70 mph

Looking at the accident reports, you might have expected to find that 
the faster people drove, the more accidents they got into.  However, 
that wasn't the case.

Instead, to a point, the faster people drove the fewer accidents they 
got into.  That point was 70 mph.  Above that speed, accidents increased.

Further analysis showed that in fact someone travelling 5 mph slower 
than 70 mph was just as likely to get in  an accident as someone 
travelling 75 mph, and that this distribution continued, to the point 
where someone going 55 mph, the legal limit, was just as likely to be in 
an accident as someone going 85 mph; speed of participants distributed 
in roughly a bell curve around the average speed on the road.

Now it -is- true that the severity of the accidents were much worse with 
the people going faster... but most people didn't get in accidents at 
all, particularly not the ones going the common speed, instead of the 
extreme risk takers going the legal posted limit (or worse, under it!)
