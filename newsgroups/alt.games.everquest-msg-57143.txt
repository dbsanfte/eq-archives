agreed.  If I pulled the sort of things Verant did in my role,  I would be
sacked in an instant.   It is pretty obvious that customer service, testing,
resilient data design,  etc, is really not in their radar.

In a way, I can understand some of the issues (8 hours downtime for a patch?
yup,  fully understand that.  need to do a full backup before even thinking
about a patch.  But really, sometimes they should just say "oops, patch no
work" and roll it back to the backup, get the servers back up, and work on
the patch offline).  but then they should have less patches, make them way
more solid, and announce them further ahead.

But a server renum?  good grief, should be well known way in advance and
taken into account in annoucmetns, if not automatic updates.

Always wondered if the other games such as AC, AO, DaoC,  are more
controlled in thier patches.
