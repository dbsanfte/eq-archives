Don't underestimate the value of Hide and Sneak, btw.

My love plays a halfling cleric.  You'd be amazed how often she's done a CR
using an invis potion and Sneak.  It's not Rogue hide/sneak, but it comes
close; she can tiptoe under a dragon's tail dragging a rogue, click him in
at a safe spot, then medd up while the rogue finishes the CR.  I can't count
how often this happened in the old Hate; she could Atone to drop herself on
the aggro list, click an invis potion, hit Sneak, and 9 times out of 10 get
camped while the mobs are still eating the enchanters and other clerics.
Log back in, invis potion is still up, hit Sneak again, and start dragging
corpses to SWC...
