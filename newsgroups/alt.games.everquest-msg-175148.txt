Hi there!

I don't know much pages concerning enchanter stuff. Xornn's page is
abandoned but still alive. There you can find some very detailed
informations about our spells, tactics and so on. Unfortunately it
covers only spells and descriptions up to level 55 or so.
Another source is perhaps the Castersrealm page.
Here the links:
Xornn: http://members.tripod.com/xornn/
Castersrealm: http://eq.castersrealm.com

Perhaps you try to search with google. I think there you should find
some more informational sites about enchanters.

Good luck!
