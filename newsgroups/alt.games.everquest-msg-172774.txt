Ok that is fine unless you have ALOT of things to sell and 1) dont want to
re-type each time and 2) are chatting and such while selling.

What you can do is turn on the /log and then "say" the item links so they
are pasted to the log.  This will show item link codes that you can then
edit into a macro button (outside of EQ) and then have a macro button that
will shout your links to the world.
