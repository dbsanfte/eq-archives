The CON system doesnt work over approx level 20. Reason is that the game is
unbalanced in its design and they made NPCs overpowerful. You should start
noticing this difference in NPC vs PC balance around 20th level.

Noticed how some MOBs have high AC and hit as if they had godlike damaging
weapons, and when you kill them, they have nothing on them even if they are
human.
