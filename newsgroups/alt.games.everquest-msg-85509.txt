Ok, I keep hearing arguments about WIS casters "NEED MORE!" stuff so I
thought I'd drop a quick reminder on a couple points as well as a question.

First the question...

How much wis is "enough" for skill building?

What I mean is if you have a bit over 100 cha, that is all you need to get
the best prices you can get from vendors.  Is there a similiar "cap" for
skill building?  (i.e. does someone with 250 wis learn faster than someone
with 120?)

With that stated, here are a few fun facts on wisdom.

Here is an example of 2 extremely nicely equiped druids -- 30th level
twinks.  Both Human.  One Wisdom intensive, 1 Mana intensive on equipment.

Starting stats were baseline with all points put into wisdom (115 starting
wis) and Karana worshipers (lets an easy 4 wis earing be gotten for the wis
intensive).

NOTE:  All equipment can be purchased.  None is No Drop nor GM event only.

Not including HP boosts, AC or what not, getting mana equipment seems quite
under rated by most until they max out their wisdom ( I let this wis fellow
go WAY over the top but, still, even if you shuffled around the start up
stats to 105 wisdom to allow for 255 max, the mana branch is extremely
nice...).

Figured what the heck...  let's have some fun here with a debate and
discussion on a different approach ;)
