Just based on comments from wizards in my guild (my highest wizard is low
50s), nobody has ever regretted getting harvest-2 and all the crit AAs they
can.  Wizards are a one-sided character, so anything that enhances that
aspect of the class is obviously a "Good Thing".

Innate intelligence?  My low 50s wizard has maxed intelligence and isn't even
wearing a robe...
