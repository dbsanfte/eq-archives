hi

does anyone else have this problem:

some of my alternative views (default F9) aren't working properly.

1st person is fine
top down is fine
behind is fine
but the other 2 dont work correctly

i can either look at the floor or look at the ceiling.

strange thing is that of the 2 borked views, they didnt screw up together,
one went a few days after the 1st one went.

i /petitioned but the guide said to go to tech supp at sony

its very important that i get these working again as i use them all the time
(ie medding whilst checking for wanderers)

any ideas?

TIA
