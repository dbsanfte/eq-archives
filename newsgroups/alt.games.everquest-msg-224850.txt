I wouldn't have said it that way. Solo gives you the least choice of 
strategy, yes. But solo also gives the least margin of error to execute 
the strategy, and the strategy itself may be significantly more 
complicated. Breaking a 3 or 4 spawn solo requires much more careful 
planning than with a group.

True. More strategies are available. But as often as not, with a group 
you can just 'brute force it', with little to no regard for all the 
various possibilities and factors. It may lack the efficiency and 
finesse of perfectly executed tactics, but it'll get you through.

And far too often: 'Main Tank' + Healer + Damage Class will work "OK". 
even if there are better ways of handling the fight.
