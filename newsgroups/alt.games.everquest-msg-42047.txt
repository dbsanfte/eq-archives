If the idea of doing the work to obtain the spells yourself is appealing,
then start researching.  Go to the research link on Allakhazam to read up on
it.  It will take you to Mythiran Tower.

I don't feel like looking it up, but I thought because of the way the
advances are calculated, you may not be able to increase your research skill
until you hit level 19, and then I think it will only go up like 1 point
until you hit level 20 or something.

I started research with my necro at 16.  I haven't started research with my
Enchanter, and he is 27.  When Zym was around level 18, I was auctioning to
buy a few specific pages at the Lake of Ill Manners an while at the bank in
FV, a gentleman said he may have the pages I need.  He handed me close to 80
pages ( many of them duplicates, and only 1 of the 2 I would need for the
combines ) and at least half of my research only spells up to level 49.  I
was floored and quite appreciative.  When I get to a level where there is a
spell I don't have, I will put a point in research, but I'm holding out as
long as I can for now.
