This is a big problem for druid although LDON has gone a long way to correct
that I have been main healer in ldon groups and we have succeeded quite
easily at 55 which is great. I think if druids got a slow spell (even if
only for animals) it would do no end of good for groupability in other areas
as well as ldon.
