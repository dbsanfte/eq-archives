Druid and shaman heals were a nerf.  CHeal reduction was not a nerf for any but
the most uber of situations... although it was a reduction of potential that was

about to develop with PoP release.

Clerics were a solo class before the changes... I soloed at least half my
exp from 44 to 60.  They are a better solo class now, and fixing their
AC table would complete that job.  They will never compete with
druids or shaman or necromancers or wizards as a solo class... but
they can certainly kill dark blue mobs at a rate sufficient to not seem
a total joke.

Still, thats not what lead me to reply... you forgot the real cleric
nerf... Mod Rod nerf!  This change means massive massive reduction
in the capabilities of clerics in raids and in groups with a mage in
them... even to the few remaining non-epic clerics who have to rez
people by spending mana.
