[I know, I know, replying to myself is tacky.  tfb]

Just one more thing Peter.  Rereading my post it comes off as
rather patronizing, that was not my intent.  I was trying to be
supportive of your good intent while pointing out that, overall,
this group is nowhere's near as hostile or mean-spirited as a
newcomer might think.  I'm probably the most abrasive poster
currently active here, and you might have noticed that I'm trying
to provide useful advice rather than flaming you.  We've seen a
lot of trolls here (some folks think I'm one of 'em, no doubt) and
so there's a certain level of suspicion towards newcomers.  Also,
a number of us have little or no patience with whining (how whining
is defined varies from person to person, of course), so it helps to
pose your questions more in the form of "How do I...?" or "What did
I do wrong when I...?", rather than some variant of "Why did SOE
screw me?" or "Why is SOE so stupid?".  A little patience and a few
posts will cause the "suspicion of trolling" to evaporate.  Beyond
that, a thick skin is generally useful on usenet.
