The EQ2 website has been updated
(http://everquest2.station.sony.com/index.jsp)

inc typical Foxeye post about character models...

I'm giddy with glee over how they've handled the human models, both male
and female (the aging on the human guy on the top right is astounding),
but someone needs to tell SOE that:

1) Dark elves have blue skin
2) Female iksar are lizards, not mammals...hence no chest-bumps

Not to say iksar and dark elves don't look good...it's just this little
thing called consistency. :/  

Oh, and I think rat-people can be a PC race now. :D  (At least, I suspect
that a "ratonga" is what they call those ratmen that are on the FAQ page
and the cover of Computer Gaming Montly).  No frogloks, though.  Trolls
are scary, which is as they shoudl be, but I can't comment on how folks
who like trolls would feel about the new model.
