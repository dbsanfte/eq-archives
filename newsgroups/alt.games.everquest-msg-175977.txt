That used to work, but they broke it when they added the
"new UI".  It's one of the bugs they haven't gotten around
to fixing yet.

First, make sure you have them targeted, so that you are
talking "to" them.

As for the keywords, unfortunately Sony isn't strict about
making the "trigger phrase" exactly equal to the bracketed
[key words].

Sometimes just typing the bracketed words back at them
works fine.  (Try using a question mark on the end, it
sometimes seems to help).

Sometimes it expects a certain "lead-in".  For example,
if the key phrase is "[elephant parts]", it may accept
only "What about the elephant parts?" and not just "Elephant
parts?" or "What elephant parts?"

Or you may have to rephrase the sentence.  "[Bring it to me]"
obviously has to be recast as "I can/will bring it to you"
instead of just parroting, "Bring it to me".

A more annoying example of this is the NPCs who talk in
"dialect", like a dwarf saying, "I need ya ta
[carry it ta Boridain]".  Depending on the programmer
who coded that particular quest, you may have to say
"I will carry it *to* Boridain", or "I will carry it
*ta* Boridain".  Sigh.

So the short answer is the programmers aren't consistent.
If the obvious trigger phrase doesn't work, start
experimenting.  If all else fails check a "spoiler"
site like www.allakhazam.com.

You can use Alt-Tab to shift keyboard/mouse focus to another
application.


>Sometimes I get spell interrupted when I am standing perfectly still ?

Other people have given good answers.  Along with those,
standing right smack up against a wall can cause "interrupts"
too.  Maybe you move yourself when you wave your arms casting,
smacking your hand against the wall or something...


>Why is my combat music down in blackburrow totally off-key ? :)

The gnolls are tone-deaf.
