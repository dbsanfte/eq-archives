This is correct. Moreover my 65 ranger got the entire room when I
tried to pull a rat (solo, I was just screwing around) and promptly
got smoked. They hit like a sol ro mob or so it seemed to me (high
600s). However when I took my 48 paladin in (solo again) I single
pulled with ease, and may well have been able to fight inside the room
itself without adds. Not sure what to make of that.

The mobs seemed to have absurdly high hp and the respawn rate was
apparently too much for even a normal group of 65s to keep up to, but
that might have been rebalanced. My paladin got about 3% normal exp at
48 per kill which is pretty good on a per kill margin but was quite
bad when the absurd amount of time it took to kill the rat was taken
into account. My ranger did not even come close to killing one. :-)

Framerates in that zone can be extremely bad; the zone is not
optimized and was never meant to go live, as per the devs.

 the village, "now the Old Bear wants them talking as well? No good will
 come of *that*, I'll warrant. And who's to say the bones wouldn't lie?
 Why should death make a man truthful, or even clever? The dead are likely
 dull fellows, full of tedious complaints - 'the ground's too cold, my
 gravestone should be larger, why does *he* get more worms than I do....'"
