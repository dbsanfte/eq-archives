God, this brings back memories... in the early days, the only way to
get a decent graphical experience was to own a 3dfx card because the
whole thing was originally meant to be a Glide-only engine.  It's hard
to believe people were still targeting a proprietary API back then,
but Glide games made 3dfx cards sing, and 3dfx dominated.

DirectX support was added as an afterthought, and it took until the...
hmmm... DX6? upgrade for other cards to start working well.  I think
other cards worked before that, but they all had at least one major
flaw it seemed.

I believe I was running a Voodoo2 SLI rig when I got EQ originally,
then upgraded to the mistake that was the Voodoo3 solely because I was
paranoid about non-3dfx cards' performance in EQ.  After the Voodoo3 I
switched to nVidia.  I'm now a few generations behind on my video card
(it's a GF4 Ti4200), but I don't really care anymore.  I used to be
one of those nuts that upgraded to the latest $300 card as soon as it
came out, but then I got married. :)
