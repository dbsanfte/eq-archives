Yes, you are correct.  Move along, nothing to see here. Certainly
no blue to 60 mobs that die easily with nothing but a cleric nuking them
(or now tanking them)  Nope nope nope, everyone go somewhere else
and let me and every last stinking guildmate and "I'll owe you a favor"
guy I ever rezed go raze the place to the ground trying to get shards
to drop.

I'll give you a personal tell when I'm done, since at that point the
mobs will miraculously return to their ordinary low hp easy to
kill phat exp (for an outdoor zone) status, which would explain
why I've been soloing there for the past 2 months.
