I wouldn't forget about that key necessarily.  If you do pickup groups, you
will find a very wide range of playing abilities.  Including those too
stupid to get mobs off the primary healer.  I have personally been in that
situation with my shaman, in a pickup group with 3 taunt capable tanks.  I
died because not one of them felt it necessary to taunt off of me while I
stood there like an idiot taking a beating, knowing full well, that the mobs
would be taunted off me.  Fortunately, I have a group of friends I play with
regularly, and almost never get into pickup groups anymore.  If my friends
aren't on, I solo, at least that way, I die due to my own stupidity.
