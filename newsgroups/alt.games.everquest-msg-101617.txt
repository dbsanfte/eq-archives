Hi all,

Here's a question to anyone willing to answer :).

I want to upgrade my home machine to Win2k or XP. If the hardware
stays the same... which OS would run EQ Trilogy better?

(I have yet to upgrade to Luclin, the hardare requirements sorta scare
me.  My video card only has 16MB)

Also, what are some good sites for newbies?  I know of
www.eqatlas.com.  Specifically I am looking for a list of towns with
the items they sell, as well as the NPCs location.

Thanks mucho in advance,

And happy gaming!
