Well, I just killed Sergeant Slate for my first time :)

I am level 39, and he conned yellow... I had to try...
Found him engaged with an Iksar monk...
Slate was not yet hurt, the (level 51!) monk started to run off,
I ran after them, send him a tell that I was gonna help,
and then I got him to stop, so I could cast on Slate :)
First snare sticked right away, then he resisted my Scourge,
then pet had catched up with me, I sent it in,
dotted with Venom of Snake, then feared,
fear wore off in the same second...
I feared again, and this time it sticked.
Resisted Scourge again, but at the third time it sticked...
then I nuked him 4 times with Spirit Tap and let
my pet finish him off...
The monk didnt see my invite till it was too late -
now guess who got the xp :)

I actually managed to outdamage a monk that was 12 levels
higher than me :)

Slate is a wimp!

Gonna try and solo him next time I get a chance...
