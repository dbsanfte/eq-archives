Intro Video??

You mean you're still using the original EQ CD and leaving it in the
drive???

As far as I know, that video is read straight from the CD, and was only ever
on the old yellow 'first edition' (for want of a better term) of EQ. If you
don't have the CD in the drive, and you don't need to keep it there to run
EQ, then you won't see the intro.

It got left off Kunark and later expansions to save space.

If it IS the monitor causing the problem then, as far as Windows is
concerned, it's "non standard" and would require a special driver... but it
would have to be a VERY old monitor... I mean REALLY, REALLY old... and
prolly TOO old to run EQ anyways!! :o)

To give you any real help we need to know what video card you use, what
version of windows you use, and what settings you currently have entered
into EQs Graphic Options. I sounds like you've got Windows set to run at
less than 640x480 (is that even possible with W98 and later?) and your PC
isn't changing resolution until the program needs it to run at the intro's
resolution.
