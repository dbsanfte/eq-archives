Actually, the only terrible thing is the unlimited shout.
Here is the comment I sent in response to Absor's post.

Greetings. All the changes are very good, except the one about shout.
Please, please leave it the way it is. <gets down on his knees to beg> When
I shout and listen to shouts it should not go all the way across a vast zone
such as West Karana. With anonimity not required and all the uses of the
user made channels, an unlimited shout is not nessesary. If someone wants to
talk with the whole zone population, they can join a channel called "westk"
or even server-wide a channel called "shout". So again, I beg you to keep
shout the way it is. Thank you for reading. J T (Jathal Emberstaff, Wizard
of the 29th Power)

If anyone else agrees with this please send him a comment, too.
Thanks
JT
