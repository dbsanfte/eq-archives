    I spent so much time spinning in circles in the tunnel to/from Grobb
because of how badly lighting was done. I had friends that wouldn't even
touch the game until the darkness issue was solved, because running around
blind sucks. Same as the spell book - after I got out of the book I
campaigned rigorously to get rid of that abomination.

    "Real corpse recoveries" sounds like the ones where corpses rotted and
people lost multiple levels, like Fear. As a member of a raid guild which
started back in the old days, lots of past and present members remember
stuff like that. None of them remember it fondly.

    The spell thing wasn't quite so bad. Smart players were able to get
enough cash for the "core" spells for their class, assuming they could guess
what those were.

    Being naked for as long as starting players were, in a game about
finding great treasures, sucked. What was even worse was how little most of
those "great treasures" did for your character once you did find them, not
that anyone knew until people started parsing.

    Does anyone really want a game where it takes one year just to get to
the endgame, by which point expansions will be out and the pegs moved again?
A game with that extreme a time requirement is just going to turn into
powergamer heaven, like EQ has.

    A lot of people remember the joy of exploration and gloss over all the
useless hassle that went with it. You can make a game with oodles to
discover without making it a crapfest like much of early EQ was.
