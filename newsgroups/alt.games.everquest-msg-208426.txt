Some pathetic waffle.

SOE will never learn because their collective heads are firmly up their
collective arseholes, thus ensuring they are protected from anything new
that just might improve things. I refer of course to the requirement
that if you want to work for SOE, you need a EQ character over 60 (as
recently advertised). This sort of ensures that they only get people who
basically think the game is okay.

Hah, they know that this is just a dummy spit and that YOU WILL send in
that payment.

What else are you going to do?

I used to think that $AUS24/month for EQ was cheap entertainment. Now I
am thinking that I would be better to buy a new SF book a month (about
same price). Over the years, I will build up a great SF library, whereas
with EQ, there is nothing.
