Warriors are the best MA against uber mobs because of their defensive disc.
In a place like Sebilis an SK is easily as good as a Warrior as MA

My monk isnt anywhere near uber twinked, and I dont have a problem as MA in
certain camps.  Going to take the warrior always? Umm no.  If im doing any
of the top level camps in Sebilis, id rather 2 monks and a rogue (or
1monk/ranger/rogue) then a warrior/SK/Pali if the group was competent.

>That's why you'd "hope" > the SK wouldn't be stuck as MA too often. They

bullshit they arent.  if an SK can MA in king in Seb, how more optimum can
you get?  Either you can live to tank them or you can't, cleric mana isnt
generally an issue as the shrooms are a real beast to mez.

Are you fucking stupid?!  Look what started the thread, thats right, SHADOW
KNIGHT QUESTIONS.  Im sorry you failed to understand something I clearly
thought was obvious to all, my mistake.. ill try and make it more simple to
understand next time.

See above

so

The only '*sigh*' is at your stupidity or arrogance to assume a reply in a
"SHADOW KNIGHT QUESTIONS' thread is to all the bs you posted, and not
answering the initial question

> (Why do I see a dick waving contest coming about how uber this guy is?)

Lol, go find another post. I've said before my gear is nothing special.  You
talk shit, you misread my post, and your trying to cover your stupidity with
BS claims like this.  Get a clue.

Your too fucking stupid to realise, obviously

> Well, I guess you *were* powerleveled quite a bit, weren't you? Fighting

Im sorry I didn't make it clear enough for you to understand, I said when i
was being stupid and HTing 50 mobs at 5 or 6, nothing to do with killing
level 50 mobs.

Lol when did i even say anything for you to reply with this BS.

Gear for gear level for level, no they will not.

I meant how SLOW it hits compared to my monk, and im sorry you failed to
spot humour in a post.  Get your head out of your ass

Oh and just out of interest, what level is your champion. i wouldn't even
have a warrior below 55 in any of my sebilis groups... so have you even
tried the king camp?  (reason being, if im gonna have a warrior in the group
its to hold agro off me.. if they are below 58 and can't taunt off me, i may
as well be MA and get another rogue)

Thanks for ruining my hints and advice for Tukka with your complete bullshit
response.  Try and READ the post properly next time.
