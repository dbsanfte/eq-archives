I was sitting in PoK on my lizzy doing Virtue buffs last night.  Several
people complained they couldn't target me. I was in overhead view and could
see them dance all around me trying to click on me. So, just for the heck of
it,  I dismounted and ask them to try again. Instantly they could click on
me. Then I started asking did they update their drivers and what video card
they had. In each case, they would say they did update and that they had an
ATI card. From then on, when someone complained they couldn't click on me, I
would just ask, "do you have an ATI card" they would answer yes, I would
dismount and say "try now" and they could click on me. When I told them what
I was doing a few of them would say, "dismount???, I didn't even see your
lizzy".

Finally I got tired of mounting/dismounting, sitting/standing and stopped
buffing.

I'm not knocking ATI but that little experiment sure was disappointing
knowing that ATI sells a lot of cards. I sure hope this is not the "future"
of EQ and ATI owners.
