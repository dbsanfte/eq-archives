My computer is similar but with 768 of PC2100 RAM.  Instanced zones on 
Balanced (but with shadows turned off) is fine.  Towns can be kind of scary 
(I typically almost fall into the harbor in QH every time I use the bell 
:p ).

I just ordered a gig of dual-channel PC3200 yesterday...I'm looking forward 
to seeing how much that helps. :)
