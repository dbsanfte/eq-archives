And they're right.

And thank god we don't have to put up with people who let their party
members die because they got a really funny email they had to peruse
that instant. Too many people suck at paying attention as it is
without adding that complication. Or at least adding to it; most
people who think they're a god at using two computers at once aren't
nearly as good at it as they think they are.

I think they've heard of it. What the point actually is is to make it
a lot harder to 'casually' cheat, for the non-whiz to cheat. The kind
of person who basically does two things with their computer - surf the
web and play EQ. And, given EQ's success at stomping cheats, I'd say
it worked. They know nothing they could do beyond total encryption
would stop a real hacker, but with so much serverside anyways there
isn't a whole lot a real hacker can do.

EQ's generally cheat free reputation, especially compared to all the
other MMORPGs speaks for itself.
