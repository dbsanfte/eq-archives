Just been on my first plane raid. A pickup raid. And man was it bad. Spent
8 hours in the entrance, because cleaning took so long, there were about
25 people of several guilds, uncoordinated. Half of them had no idea
who the raid leader was and people reformed groups however they liked
instead of following what the raid leader created ("It's unfair! I
want to be in an exp group!"). Childrens garden. I have been told,
every raid is like this. And when, after 4 hours, we finally moved to
the second floor of the 'church' (I think) and all died within about
20 mobs that turned up 5 minutes after we arrived and fought on that
floor. So yes, it seems to be impossible with 25 pepople to move from
A to B without having some moron touching something ("A rat attacked me,
but I safely made it here .. no idea hwere it is now"). Oh my god. 
If it wasn't for an item I wanted or seeing something new, I'd flee as 
fast as I can as soon as I hear 'Raid'. But there's this chance of being 
on a coordinated Raid maybe with only just my guild. I still have this
wonderful image of a three or 4 group raid, with balance, with
organisation, with good people who know what to do :) 
So ... 'just port up and run to camp' is not exactly easy. Not
with so many incompetents running around. My fault for going to
a pickup raid my first time I guess.
