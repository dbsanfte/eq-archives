Xipat,

Take a look at Random Acts....I've been a guildmate for a few months now and
have hunted with many members before that.

Great group of people and many of us are just now approaching our 40's and
higher although there is no lvl restrictions that I am aware of.

We have, in my opinion, good participation within the guild.  We meet twice
a week for First Aid camps to help the newbies out.

Check out our home page for more info at
http://www.eqrandomacts.com/default.asp.

Granted, the web page is fairly lite, but be sure to read the Message boards
there for LOTs of discussion.

Or send me a tell sometime in game.  = )

This 41 Wiz would always love a Chanter to group with = )

/em wave
