Wow! I love the bits of history I pick up here. I've only been playing 
for a year and I didn't know that. That must have been a hoot to have 
KEI at low levels. LOL!

I still maintain that it doesn't really matter that much. This is a 
game, not rocket science. I don't think if I could have had KEI 
sometimes as a low level toon it would have kept me from learning to 
manage my mana over the long haul for those times (which at least for me 
would have been most of the time) I would have it. I always liked being 
temped but I would never waste a lot of time trying to get it. If I 
could pick it up easily, great. More fun. If not, oh, well. There is 
something to be said for "roughing it."
