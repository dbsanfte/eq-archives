I am more afraid, by far, of Bush, Cheney, Ashcroft, Rice, et. al. than I
ever was of al Qaeda, Hussein or Korean nukes.  I believe I am still right
to be, even after September 11.  They total disregard for the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights borders on treasonous.  But, the man that scares me
most, Karl Rove.  This is the same man that, as a teenager, lied about being
a Democrat to work as a volunteer on a political campaign in Illinois, only
to steal stationary and send out invitations to a free drug/alcohol party
just to sabotage the campaign.  It worked.  He's just perfected his lies and
dirty tricks since then.
