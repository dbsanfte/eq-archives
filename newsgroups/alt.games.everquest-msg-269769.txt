As said, EQ1 was made by different developers than ultimatley took over
design of the game.  For alot of people, EQ1 went downhill starting around
PoP (though many like that exp), and got worse from there.

Check out Vanguard if you want a game in development that is closer to
'feel' as the original EQ was.

Have no clue what K Andrews is on about, prolly implying you are a troll,
more likely, he is an idiot fanboy who cant even bear to see the name of a
game he doesnt like...etc.
