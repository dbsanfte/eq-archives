Well, first of all, video game programmers aren't as adept at
programming as the guys that write the engineering, graphics, etc
software that costs hundreds to thousands per copy. If they were,
they'd be programming that stuff instead of games. ><

Second, yeah, I imagine it wouldn't take a genius to make a more
stable code for a game that's not continuously having new content
added and old content revised... Hey, guess what? The more you alter
software, the more bugs can creep in... "How in the fuck can an item
just disappear?"? Um...bug. Duh. I doubt it even takes that big of a
hiccup in the code to eat an item...

*shrug* I don't expect perfection out of a game. If I paid more for
it, I would expect better... (Like, say, as much as the Legends guys
pay. >< But they pay extra by choice knowing full well that the
software's gonna be exactly the same...) If something more important
in my life depended on the software running flawlessly, I'd expect
perfection. But, in the end, it's a game and there's no point in
getting bent out of shape when it hiccups.

Now, true, if it were crashing every 10 seconds and wiping my
characters daily, I'd be upset. But it's not. I've yet to encounter
any bug so critical that I can't enjoy the game. Worst I encountered
was a minor inconvenience for a couple hours, then I got on with
enjoying the game...
