The point was to enjoy yourself. EverQuest is a game--entertainment.
If you were enjoying the game most of the time and now feel the need
to come and whine, you're an idiot. OTOH, if you weren't enjoying the
game most of the time and you continued to play anyway, you're still
an idiot. So, IDWYS. It's probably got "PROPERTY OF IDIOT" stamped all
over it.
