I'm doing some homework on the Firepots (a la TimDeep) and Miragul's
Highway.  I've located the clickable firepots in Qeynos Catacombs and Neriak
3rd Gate and I'd like some help in tracking down others.  I don't expect to
find them in all zones but, probably, all cities.  Can you keep your eyes
peeled and, if you spot one, jot down the approximate location of it?
Merci.
