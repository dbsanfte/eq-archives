The 1-45 game is pretty much the same as the 46-60 game...just add people
and a very few new strategies.

You learn the VAST majority of your lessons from 1-30.  Starting with this
patch you're going to have a lot more level 31 newbies...which is a scary
thought considering the number of level 60 newbies (NOT e-bay) that I run
across almost daily.

I kinda have to wonder why they don't simply dump 1-10 altogether and start
everyone at 11?
