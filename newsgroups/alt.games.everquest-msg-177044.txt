Your god asked me to save him, but I didn't, because he smells like =
poop.

  God told me that this forum that I have chosen is more suitable than =
every single Christian church in the world to say what I need to say, =

in any Christian church.

  He also said that a lot of kids in the three video game groups would =
be saved and that was a very good idea, and most of my eventual reward =
will come from doing that. Also said no one from pagan or feminism =
groups would be saved and that more people from the mercedes group would =
