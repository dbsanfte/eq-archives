OMFG what a bunch of crap. My current guild has several female players (RL)
and several husband/wife teams, never had the problems you spoke of except
once, she didn't like one of the higher level female players because that
female got to go on all the raids ( was petty) but she deguilded without
problems on her own and didn't seem to fit in any guild. The stuff you
talked about goes on with the guys too. I don't know how many times I have
heard male players whine about gear or that they are too low to go on a
raid, where as the females tend to be a bit shyer about whining about gear
they just want to go on the raids. Seems like the females tend to be the
peacemakers and the ones to get everyone invovled. The guys tend to take
over in the raids - male macho thing.
