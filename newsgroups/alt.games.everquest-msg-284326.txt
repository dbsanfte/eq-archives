HELLO FOLKS.Since my last update, I have moved up nearly ..2 ..levels and 
feeling somewhat comfortable. I enjoy reading you "posts" each morning,with 
java ,and again marvel at your expertise and insight.I have moved on from my 
previous location,sand giant hill,,south Ro (dk blue was starting to 
disappear readily) to "timorous deep". I have been told that this area is 
now a "hot zone".My first encounter this morning was somewhat of an "eye 
opener" .These "raptors" can smell you a mile away,and always bring friends 
to the feast! The "dog" and I managed 4 kills before we were run-off to a 
smaller island with a "checker board" /..the "dog didn,t make it!
I have learned to keep "levitation" on the horse, at all times,since he 
doesn't, like water.And have noticed that I cannot cast a spell ,while 
mounted, over water.
                     During normal game banter,I have heard people "looking 
for a slower". Does this refer to myself,as I have "spells" that make the 
"goons" feel "lethargic" "yawn" or "feels defuffed?(whatever that 
signifies).Secondly should these spells be used during game play or are they 
insignificant?
                    Well that's all for now,again many thanks
....................Peter Wolfe
