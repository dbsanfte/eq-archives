...and to counterbalance my griping in another thread, I thought I'd 
mention one of the nicer things that happened to me recently: 

  My druid ported into WC late one night to find a level 60 troll warrior 
running around like a madman, yelling "Help!" with a skeleton on his 
heels. The skeleton of course wasn't able to damage him, so I watched in 
bemusement for a minute or so, and then nuked the skeleton to see what 
would happen. 
  The warrior stopped running, walked over to me, bowed...

  ...and handed me something like 120 platinum in gold. 

  I thanked him profusely, and watched while he went on to aggro another 
skeleton and run around screaming "Help!" again. It's little moments like 
this--players doing little quest-type things--that keep me coming back to 
the game.

"I'm sorry, did I offend you just now? Pardon me--I'm
sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. Really, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to offend you. Should I like, change my 
attitude? Should I change my whole way of  being? Huh? 
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. BITE ME HARD!"
