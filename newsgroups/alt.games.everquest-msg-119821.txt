<< snippage quandry >>

So basically, what you're saying is that it would be impossible for
you to function under any sort of "honor system", since you,
naturally, would try to take advantage of someone offering
goods/services merely because they didn't specify a price up front. I
think that says it all right there.

Though I do agree that the "donation" idea, though rp-related, is kind
of hokey in the way it's evolved in EQ, the fact remains that if you
know what something is worth, you should pay it if at all possible. If
you don't, you are deliberately ripping someone off. It's really quite
simple.

People who port for donations are actually hoping for some good will,
and you obviously have no interest in showing any.

If you want to specify a price up front, fine. I don't have a problem
with that. Just don't try to say it's their fault for offering up a
cheek after you give it a good hearty slap.

> Let me reiterate here that my main is a level 52 druid.

That is impressive. Gratz. However, whoop-de-shit. Doesn't mean your
opinion in all matters druidic is gospel. This is actually a matter of
ethics anyway. On which my opinion - 14 Druid, just got SoW, yay! -
carries equal weight.
