>What Verant does for non US customers: Sells the product, takes their money.

Pretty much like every other company in the world then?

hold. 

Yes its annoying. Thats what e-mail is for, takes longer, gets the same
results- costs bugger all.

>Provides 1 non US server for the thousands of non US players. Shuts
>down that server with all the others even though that is at peak playing
>hour for non US players.

Thats what ALL means. They ALL go down together, they ALL get the patches
together.

> Never responds to tech support queries, except to
>tell them to phone the tech support number even after it has been >made clear
that they do not live in the US. 
>Doesn't advetise or make the product widely (available)
>outside the US. 

You found it, you bought, as did i and many others. 

>Sets up great conventions for players in the US but nothing
>for those outside the US. 

They tried -they failed- maybe next time?

>Paramount pictures is a US company. Yet it makes it's Star Trek >products
widely available around the world and sets up conventions >outside the US too.

30 years of practice at conventions. Guess they had time to get it right?


>Ok, heres your que, all you whiny pissant US flamers who are gonna >say, "oh
yeah so what, I live in the US, so I don't give a shit.

That would be *queue*, and why should they give a shit, its not their problem.
There's enough shit to worry about without worrying about shit  that doesn't
personally affect you.

>Get ready you sad pathetic gimps outside the US, and defend the lovely,
>cuddly Verant who loves us all so very much.

  
As one 'sad pathetic gimp outside the US'  to another - I like their game ,
they like my money - i consider it to be a fair swap. 
However when they fuck up i am more then happy to let them know. 


>Whatever your response, just do one thing. Prove that my comments about
>verant are wrong.

No.  I agree the tech support could definately be improved, as could other in
game features probably, but bitching here will never get them solved. That's 
what /bug  and /feedback are there for.

>Oh and btw, lets have no, "your the sad pathetic whiner" 

Well you are!

>or "if you hate eq why are you still playing the game"

Why do you?

> or "learn how spell, or learn correct grammer" 

Would it kill you?

>soooo old and boring. Oh and no "your the old boring one"
>Get off you flabby arse

I like my flabby arse - it saves looking for a cushion.

> and excersise your brain for more than just concentrating on jerking off your
dick to internet porn.

I like jerking off to internet porn - its easier then going down the pub to
find someone to do it for me. 
It used to be a pint of cider and a ham-shank -oh the good 'ol days.
Now you have to meet the parents first. Sod that. 


>Oh and no "your a sad pathetic loser for posting this in the first place" >A 5
year old could come up with that

No, a 5 year old would probably be putting gum inside your shoes 
and i'd be handing them the gum.

>And dont put one of those stupid quotes at the bottom of your post, what a

At least i have the balls to sign my work and not hide from shit that may come
my way.


Now.  Troll yourself out of that chair - get yourself down to the local store -
and get yourself a life - third row down - next to the tampax.
