OK, now we're seeing the real 'you' - you're stupid enough to assume that
Islam is the problem and the ONLY problem at that!!
The people who committed the acts of the 11th were driven using their faith
undoubtedly but are NOT typical of it - Islam is NOT the problem...

Question: Do you have ANY idea how PISSED OFF people have to be to do things
like they did?

What I can't grasp is why the US can't realise that it's pissed SOOOOOO many
people off SOOOOOO badly that they'll commit such atrocities??
Once you've worked out that simple fact then perhaps, you could STOP pissing
them off BEFORE they do it again?

On no, you just wrap yourselves up in the flag and start flexing the very
money and might which caused most of the problems in the first place...

You're right about one thing tho - lots of things are gonna get worse before
they get better - and the US's belief that it's better than the rest of the
world is one of them...
