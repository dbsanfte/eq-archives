Hi everyone!

I am starting to get annoyed at my lag issues in the game.  Until recently,
I never experienced this problem, lag was an issue, but it is getting worse.
This is going on in the old plane zones and also in the new ones, newer
zones being the worst of course.  This is what I am running

Windows XP Professional
800 meg intel
44 gig HD
768 ram
NVIDIA GeForce2 MX/MX 400

and we also network the 2 computers together.

Please, if you have any advice on what can be done to fix my lag issue, I
would be greatful.

If you need anymore specs about my PC I will be happy to post them=)

I am also running Norton, so I do not have viruses=) I also regularily check
for spyware.

TIA
