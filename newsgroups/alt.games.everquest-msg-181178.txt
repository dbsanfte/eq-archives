Mentioned by other peeps already, but I'm sure what's happened in that a
host of other people had the same idea you did, but had since camped. When
they logged back in, they didn't look around. I've had it happen to me - was
actually right there when it happened. I gave a nasty gram to the dude, but
he was really nice and just explained that his toon has moved except to camp
in weeks - he just didn't realize. He scooted over a tad, and life was fine.

No, he's "Window Shopping". There is a limit on how many rows the bazaar
window will return. If you just put in "human" as you suggest in another
post, you will see a LOT of stuff, but you won't see everything. More
importantly, you won't see all of ONE thing, which means you could think
that you're getting the best price, but there may be 3 lower prices out
there. I've tested this several times. I'll do something that provides a
huge result set, then seach again on one of the items returned - only to
find that there are several more of those items on sale than appeared in the
original query.

/agree

I send people tells with offers, but then go about my business. I've
provided reasoning on my offers before on "unique" items - particularly
those I know have been on sale for a while - but I don't belabor the point.

This was understandable back when some people were still on the old UI, but
I don't get it now.

/agree

The  bazaar is just that - a bazaar, a flee market, a garage sale - deal
with it. If we set a lower price, then, well, you can set a lower price if
you like. This is business folks.

This are often folks learning a tradeskill and trying to skillup. They are
trying to make more than they can get from the vendor, but they have too
many of them and there are too many other similar tradeskillers out there to
get all that great of a price. When I was doing smithing, it cost me like
45pp to make Ornate Chain. It would sell to a vendor for 22pp as I recall.
The bazaar would bare around 35pp, so, there they went (that extra 13pp was
big money to me).
