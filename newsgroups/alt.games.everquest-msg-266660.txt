Its an absolute piece of junk; an item which you can click on
to give yourself a sparkly aura which does nothing but mark you
as someone who bought OOW recently.

Even better, you can only get one per account.

This reminds me of an old joke:

The food here is terrible, greasy, salty, smells like soap!
Yes, and the portions are so small!

If the item was worth having, you'd be pissed because you can only put 
it on one character, and most EQ players end up playing at least one alt 
over the years.

Fortunately, its junk so don't worry about it
