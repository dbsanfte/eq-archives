Hm, perhaps a little clarification is in order.

/gu "Hey, I've got xxx spawn up, I need five more folks to take it down,
anybody want to come help me kill it for my epic" isn't asking for guild
help - it's asking for a group's help.

Posting to the guild board "XXX mob is due up on Saturday, could I get three
plus groups together to take up half of your prime gaming time to work on my
epic" is asking for guild help.

The theories involved include:

1)  If you join the guild and spend any time grouping with and talking to
your guildies, you won't have much trouble getting at least a few folks to
help you with one-groupable stuff.

2)  If you've killed the one-groupable stuff, you at least have done some
basic research on how your epic works and nobody has to babysit you through
it.

The same guild had a rule that each time you asked for 'guild help' with a
raid, you owed 'guild help' to someone else - could be helping a lower-level
member with a CR, or doing lotto cap duty on a raid, or (gasp!) helping
someone ELSE with THEIR epic.

What precipitated this attitude was being used - we had a person join up,
get guild help doing all the raid-necessary stuff, then deguild when the got
down to just the stuff that could be solo'd - we weren't needed any more.
