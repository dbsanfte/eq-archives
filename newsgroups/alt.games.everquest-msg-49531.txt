Nope.

I'll admit, my reading's really gone down since I started playing EQ.
I'm only reading about 3 books a week, now.

Movies I've been avoiding up until recently.  Now, with my debts all
paid, I can afford to go to them more.  As for TV, you mean you
*don't* have your computer set up so that you can see the TV as well?
I play EQ and watch the tube at the same time.  Splitting time between
watching Junkyard Wars or Iron Chef and beating on undead Frogloks is
the *only* way to play.

Oh, what play?  Last one I went to was "The Mikado".

Sloppy thinking there.  I can cook a decent dinner in the time it
takes for delivery.  See my message to bizbee on the "none" thread for
some *really* easy sausages and a nice casserole.

Yup, you're overdoing it.  Especially with a wife around.  Even if she
plays too, it's not as much fun as occasionally playing something else
(like Doctor).

Outdoors?  Oh, ya, I know that place.  That's where I'm either doing 0
or 75, or spending a little time (as little as possible) between those
two points.  You call 'em people, I call 'em speedbumps.

Books.  If you've not been reading for a while, go after the
following:

1) All of the recent Vorkosigan books by Lois McMaster Bujold.  Miles
is trying to get married!

2) Rhapsody and it's sequel Prophecy, by Elizabeth Haydon.  Long
(Prophecy's 717 pages), but worth reading.  One more to come in that
series.

3) All of the recent Discworld books, by Terry Pratchett.

4) An oldie but a goodie, A Lion on Tharthee, by Grant Callin.

5) Peter F. Hamilton's trilogy (composed of 6 books) The Reality
Dysfunction / The Neutronium Alchemist / The Naked God.  A bit drawn
out, but worth reading.
