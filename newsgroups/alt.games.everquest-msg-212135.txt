Warriors need to focus on keeping their AC close to the soft cap limit and
then work on STA and HP bonus items.  AC=being hit less. When fighitng POP
mobs, their Attack rating is so high that AC becomes less effective.  From
talking to many warriors the Pre-POP AC softcap was 1200-1250.  After this
point there was no appreciable benefit in wearing higher AC gear.  After
POP, the softcap appears to fall somewhere between 1400-1450.  A shaman
guild friend of mine has told me that at 57 and with my unbuffed AC at 1208
he has to heal me less than another warrior in our guild who has focused
soley on HP and STA gear and has a lowly 1127 AC at level 61.  A 5AC
shoulder item compared to a 18-20 AC shoulder item equates to around 25-35
less total AC points.  Depending on your agility and other factors.

I am trully sorry you had to endure the pain of wearing caster type
shoulders all the way to level 65.
