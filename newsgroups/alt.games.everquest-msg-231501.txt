Someone elsewhere in the thread commented that one solution to this 
would be instanced versions of areas such that people were shunted into 
fighting mobs that -aren't- green to them.

Trouble with this is something you can see now in Droga and Nurga; these 
two areas are (almost) the only way to get Sarnak faction, which is 
necessary for some quests in chardok and quite handy for moving around 
in chardok (particularly for a COTH mage to move raids around with).

Killing one goblin means One faction point.  It takes over a thousand to 
get to non KOS, 3500 to get the Ally faction you need to get those quests.

When the mobs were green, it was possible to go in and spend a few days 
slaughtering them wholesale.  But both zones got revamped into much 
higher level areas, so in the time when you would have kill a hundred 
before you might now kill 10.  This is fine if you are there for loot or 
exp; its no longer level appropriate for someone in their 30s, its a 50+ 
thing now... but risk versus reward, or simply time versus reward, for 
the One point faction hits just got screwed by a factor of ten, because 
its still One point per kill.

Of coures a sensible solution to that would be to make the new goblins 
10 faction points per kill instead of one... but not only is that 
expecting the designers to actually think about such matters (seems 
unlikely), but we have an actual example here of them -not- doing so. 
So its pretty easy to predict that if they applied this "no zones" fix 
universally, they still wouldn't fix this "I need to kill how many 
thousand dark blue mob?" phenomenum.

Splendid
