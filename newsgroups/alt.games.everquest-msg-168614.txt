Let me spell out the diffrence :)

Conservatives have no particular love of freedom . They believe that you
should be free to do anything that they approve of but balk instantly when
you start doing things they dissapprove of. They share with democrats the
belief that goverment owns each of us and thus has the responsibility to
tell us how and what we are allowed to do.

This is easily seen on issues such as drugs, abortion , prostitution,
gambling , sexual orientation , etc.

A libertarian loves freedom enough that he will allow you to do things which
he considers morally questionable or just downright stupid as long as you
refrain from harming others directly in the process. A libertarian believes
first and foremost that we each of us own ourselves.
