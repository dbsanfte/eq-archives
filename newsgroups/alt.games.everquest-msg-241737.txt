Since I got so much help on finding my corpse, I will ask another "how to"
question.

I have 2 Froglocs, a Pal 10 and a Cler 6.  (I just started the Cleric since
the new update)  Both of these Classes work well with others according to
everything I read, especially the Cleric.  I am not against being in a
group, altho usually I get asked when I am getting ready to quit, but I am
not sure what I need to do when I am in a group.  I mean this in the most
basic sence.  I have told people that I am new at this, and they say go
attack something Blue and they will do the rest.  I can do this, but I am
not really sure what I am suppose to do.  Attack and let the others in the
group come to me? attack and lead the attacker back to the group? attack
from a distance with spells and let others be up front? etc. (Like I said, I
have no knowledge on this, a true newbie)

I hate the fact that maybe I am not the best person to group with, but with
some help I think I might be of some assistance to a group.  If there is a
place I can go and read on this, or a Zone that is good for newbie groupies
I can will that a try.

Thanks again for all I have learned on this board,

Ben aka Friben Pal 10 on Nameless
