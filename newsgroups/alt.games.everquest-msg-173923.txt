It makes the most amazing difference on soloing ability.  Before getting it,
I was struggling to solo in PoN, root and rot is the only way to solo there
for me.  It would consume either all of my mana, or huge amounts of time to
kill one mob.  With KEI, it was doable, but still quite slow.  Now, with the
epic DoT, I can just toss on a couple of my poison DoTs to supplement it,
and use the epic DoT with no fear of it breaking root.  I soloed the last
15% of level 58 in PoN last night.
