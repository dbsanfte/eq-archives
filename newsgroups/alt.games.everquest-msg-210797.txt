Well, in an environment where labour is easily replaced, and your ESP lets
you know what that least amount is, sure. That ain't the EQ world tho.

Not really. If silks were only going for 1pp per stack (5sp each), it
wouldn't be worth farming them for cash in the first place. The Qeynos
newbie yard (for example) has quite a few common drops selling to vendors
for ~5gp each off the snakes and bats and skeletons. Plague rat tails are
less common, but sell for ~1.5pp. Why bother with the hassle of farming
silks and chips in hopes of selling in Bazaar for adequate cash, when you
could farm king snake jawbones and such to sell to in-zone merchants now,
for better cash?

But you're confusing what something is worth to you, and what it's worth
to someone else. Those are two totally different concepts.

.... And you don't see this in the bazaar at all, because you have
no control over who is actually getting your stuff. If you want to
see charity in action, go to gfay and wait 5 minutes for "/ooc 20pp
to the first newb who can bring me a bat wing".

Necros and shadowknights can always use more bone chips. Maxing out
Cabilis faction takes only 8000 bone chips. And don't forget PLing
your alt by handing in bone chips in Kaladim or wherever.

Hmmm, which seems more likely to you? That there's a global conspiracy of
charitable high-level EQ players who want to make sure that plat is getting
to worthy lowbies and the best way they can think of to implement their
plan is to overpay them for newbie mob drops? Or the idea that there's
folks out there who are totally unwilling to waste another 8 hours /played
farming green spiders for enough silk to get their tailoring up another
couple points?
