ch = complete heal.  It's a 7500 point heal that clerics get at level 39.
Almost unarguably the defining spell of the cleric class besides ressing.

My point was that the MT is better able to take a beating that the
secondaries.  There are many times where others can put out more damage
and/or make the mob madder than the MT, but the MT has better damage
mitigation so the group should strive to keep the mob hitting on MT.  When
he switches to ranger then he does more damage and so he eats up more cleric
mana.  It's a waste and its dangerous.
