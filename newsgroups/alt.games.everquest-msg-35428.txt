I happened to catch that piece when it aired, and remember giggling
a bit when the woman said she played a lot, then went on to say that
she sometimes played as much as 30 hours per week... Gosh, that sure
is a lot!

Also noticed a neat GM command, /who npc merchant. Guess their /who
command is a bit more advanced than ours...

Oh yeah, and the people at the faire, who had dressed up in EQ-like
gear gave me a bit of a giggle too.
