been there, done that. Got my cleric to 200 defense.... (and my bard too, at
the same spot)
Ortallius in sro. Hes *just* blue at level 40.
Pull him to the zone line (oasis) but dont kill him. Its a terrible faction
hit.

He's a quest npc, so you might have to zone away a couple of times while
people hand in their cutthroat rings.
If you get any idiots who want to "kill him for you" (as I did), sit back
and let them take the faction hit.... he respawns in 5 mins. Im sure they
will love to be KOS in nf. Just make sure youre not in zone when he dies.

Another nice thing about fighting at zone, is you will often get a regen or
chloro tossed at you.
