I'm getting pop from a friend but unfortunatly I can't seem to be able to
find sol. and your wrong with the graphics thing only for sol, this is my
second account and when I bought them I got pop first and a week later got
sol, the new graphics were patched with pop and worked. I don't know why,
maybe I was lucky or maybe thats how it worked. Fresh install on a new comp
( not 2boxing anymore though, sold the first account). I had moved and when
I did the computer was "jiggled the wrong way" and diecided it wanted the OS
reinstalled, I complied and ripped apart everything looking for all the EQ
cd's, I only found one (kunark) and had a friend e-mail me the patcher files
for the expantions, velious worked but sol and pop did not, I got a few
files for luclin, the important ones, (bazaar, nexus), but I have an iksar
stuck in pauld. I'm in the process of getting the iso for cd1 now (got cd2
earlier) and will install just in time for the servers to go down :( (even
at DSL its going to take a few hours, 666mbs is quite big). so the story
continues, stay tuned for the next episode of "will simbiant4 get sol
someday" :) :)
