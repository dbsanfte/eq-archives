Had my skill at 37 for the longest time just to make sow potions.  With the 
new interface I'd like to increase the skill.  I easily raised it to 52 making 
the Kilva's Blistering Flesh potion which gives you a damage shield.  Now that 
I'm at 52 what are some of the cheaper combines to do that would also give me 
a beneficial potion.  Or what are some of the more popular potions that are 
going to sell quickly that won't break my bank trying to make them.
