Hi,

My level 39 Wizard has been working on raising his defense level up
to it's maximum value each time he levels.

As I understand it, he can only raise this skill 3 points each time
he gains a level.  His defense is currently at 130.

I have been keeping track of his skill increases on paper, and I think
that his defense should be able to gain 2 more points (bringing it to
132).  But I am not sure.

Is there a formula for calculating a Wizard's maximum allowable defense
at each level?

Can his defense max reach 132 at level 39?  Or am I mistaken?

(He has been holding at 130 for a long time now)

Many Thanks,

 - Mike Dorr
