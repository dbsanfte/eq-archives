Is there a comprehensive list out there of which DOTs stack with, bounce
off, and overwrite each other, cross class?

As a cleric, this was never a concern (although a list of Buff conflict
would be helpful),
and as a necro I've mostly solo'd or grouped with a Monk or once a
Wizard, not doting
classes.

As I level up, so my skyrocketing solo carreer slows down, I'm more
interested in
playing around with different partnerships, though, and having this info
at my fingertips
would sure make that easier.
