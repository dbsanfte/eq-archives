The problem, as they have said in the past, is that no one who
did the original game programming is still around. Most work on
competing products ;) They don't have documentation laying around
for the most part either, so they often have to just put in new things
with new programming and hope it works.

No one in this thread is actually answering the question of whether
wolf form lets them get kei, though ;)  If it did, it is
understandable since they did the code so a lower level could not get
a spell, tested it and it worked. Someone would have to test it in
wolf form to specifically see if it still did not work, they just
can't tell at this point what will happen.
