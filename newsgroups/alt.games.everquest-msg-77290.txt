Actually, I read what she wrote as:  There once was a time that I was 
able to gain a level in a week.  The last time that happened was when I 
dinged to 51.  (This next bit is not explicitly stated, so it requires 
reading for comprehension:  Since 51 my leveling has slowed down quite a 
bit, mainly due to the vastly increased experience requirements for each 
level.)  The most recenly level that I completed, level 54, took me 6 
weeks.  I'm so strong, see my leveling muscles.

> Clearer now?

I think it's clear to everyone but you.  It may be that something is 
blocking your view though, like the walls of your intestines.

hope that's not too subtle
