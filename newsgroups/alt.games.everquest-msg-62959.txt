Uhm...I don't understand.  Suppose you download maps as you need them.
You decide you need a map of a particular zone, so you download it.
You've now got that map.  Next time you want to go to that zone, you
can refer to the map you downloaded earlier.  What's this "load the
site every time" stuff?
