This feature was added recently, and they were afraid it might
not work entirely properly and that turning it on might
screw something up, so it was left set to "off" by default
for "safety".  People who wanted to try it could flip it on,
but would also then know to flip it back off if anything
bad started to happen as a result, which wouldn't be the
case if they suddenly made 300,000 subscribers have this
feature on by default (most of whom wouldn't even be aware
what had changed).

However, I've heard of no problems with it, and it *does*
help quite a bit if you have any chat filters activated.
Plus it helps reduce server-side bandwidth bottlenecks,
which benefits *everyone*.

What it does, exactly, is make it so that when you turn
off certain message types in the "Chat Filter" section
of your "Options" menu, the server never even bothers
sending those messages over the internet to your computer,
since you don't want to see them anyway.  Previously
those messages would still have been sent, only to be
discarded by your computer once they arrived.  This would
still waste server bandwidth, and add to the data logjam
on your modem during busy battle raids, so being able to
simply never have those messages transmitted at all is a good
idea.

So what were they afraid it was going to break?  They
were concerned that maybe the client-side program was
making use of some information from the messages that were
about to be filtered.  For example, when your client
got a message saying, "Party_member_Joe has been hit
for 125 damage", (and under the old system your computer
was still *getting* that message, even if you had it
filtered to not be displayed in the text box), the
client program might have been using that to make
timely updates to Joe's health bar, and they were
afraid that if that message never arrived at all,
your computer might not get an update on Joe's health
status until the next "global health update" data packet,
which would be bad news for clerics who needed to
see everyone's health status the instant it changed.

However, no one has noticed any big change in anything
with serverfilter turned on or off (other than the
planned improvement in modem lag and fewer LD's),
so by all means, turn it on.
