And yet its you who so completely misses the point you not only miss
the target almost every time below, you break several of your
neighbors windows in the process.

I'll just start off with one clue - something that is good for casuals
is not necessarily bad for raiders, you numbskull. The entire point of
this was simply to show how many things have been put in that have
made the casual's life easier. Not all of them are even bad changes.

No prejudice. Nexus made life easier on casuals. You have failed to
disprove this. Are you conceding the point?

No reference whatsoever to the casuals. Are you conceding the point?

Tedious is in the eye of the beholder, Kris. No reference to how this
didn't improve the lot of the casuals. Are you conceding the point?

As far as I know no loot from LDoN goes for a tenth that price, other
than on FV. Anyways loot for sale from ldons the casuals can't do
(that is your argument not mine) is in itself a positive for the
casuals. Thank you for your support. The only knock here you managed
to come up with was a nonexistant claim the ubers are farming items
and selling for exhorbitant prices; I await your proof on this.

The raiders are not the ones complaining about not being pandered to.
They are complaining about the state of what has been put in, of
course... big difference.

And as we've just seen, the casuals - who ARE complaining about not
being pandered to - are just ungrateful for what they have been given.

Unfortunately for Kris the whole crux of the matter seems to have gone
over his head.

Imitation is the highest form of flattery. Are you unable to make
points on your own or can you just ape your betters, changing a word
here or there?

No shit, sherlock. You should have thought of this before you puked
out all that crap above.

Non sequitur. Try again.

Why should you get the same rewards as raiders despite doing far less?

Why is it that casuals can't appreciate the content they have been
given?
