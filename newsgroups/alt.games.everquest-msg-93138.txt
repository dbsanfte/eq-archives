Get a grip willya?  If you want to talk about monuments to evil in a
sexist fashion how could you possibly respond to the pyramid of skulls
the Mongols created at Kiev (distant history), or more recently the
Nazi horrors committed throughout eastern Europe, can't recall any
mention of women participating in the creation of those, certainly
not in any sort of leadership role.  Sheesh.
