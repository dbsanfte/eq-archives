Even the cheapest pony is faster than most mobs, and since you can keep SOW on
with the pony up, its a simple matter to click pony off when you need a burst
of speed, all it costs you is the three seconds to resummon pony.

There's a reason my cleric is so enamoured of clicky items; I always have them
at hand, it never means memming a spell or using mana... in fact now that I'm
using a horse 90% of the time, it doesn't even cost me meditation time to use
most of them.

This last point doesn't apply to the pony, but the rest do.  If pony overwrote
SOW, I might think harder about using it, but as it stands its really no
impediment.  After all, I'm as fast as run 3 with or without the little guy,
the only time I care about SOW these days is following a SOWed party across
long distances!
