Thanks for that! I've been scared to visit luclin because I heard it had
lots of dangerous zones but i can see it's time to bite the bullet... maybe
they have necro pet  spells up there too, i have a necro and it's tedious
trying to find the right words for spell research.

If anyone else is playing a paladin and is in a  small group or a duo, i
recommend the skeleton hut in LOIO; a few adds from passers by keep it
interesting, and so long as you can beg or barter for sow, you should be
able to bail if there's too much happening.

I noticed my root gets resisted a lot by healthy blues which is a pain. I
had fun duoing with a druid, so when things went awry, snare and run for
zone worked really well.

I've heard najena is good for fighting undead, but i'm wary of any areas
with casters; under the new rules, i expect they are deadly. Mind you, i
remember having my 43 monk walk into LGuk and being nuked to death by
casters in seconds, despite them having no line of sight. Put me right off
that zone, but maybe if my paladin can get his resists up a lot (!) it could
be good to go there and take a little revenge.... 8-)
