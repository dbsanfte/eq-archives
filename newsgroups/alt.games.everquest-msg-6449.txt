Hmmmm ... I posted this before I went to bed this morning and yet I don't
see it in the thread.  Well, I apologize for doubling up on this (if I did)
but here goes (again).

I don't have an issue with Twinking per se, but there are two Twinking
related problems in which I do have issues.

#1 - Bottom Feeding.  Hey, if you're 55th level camping the Ancient Croc in
Upper Guk and two 30th level players (who can actually get XP there) come
down you should relinquish the camp.  Another example (which actually
happened to me the other night), is a group of us were hunting in Cazic
Thule (I was using my 31 SK).  We went to the Throne Room for XP and drops -
Ravenscale or the Lizardscale Mantle/Cloak.  There was a 50th level Paladin
camping there.  (He was a dwarf hiding in back so we didn't see him until we
had the spawn broken down).  Well, when it came time for the Tae Ew Templar
and Diviner to spawn (both popped at the same time) he took them both.  When
we asked him (politely) why he was there when he can't get XP, he said that
he wants items for a Cleric that he's going to make.  Then he said that he's
not leaving and we'll just have to get the regular spawns until he gets what
he wants.  That, in my opinion, in ridiculous.  Bottom Feeding when no one
else is around is one thing ... I'll admit it, I do it ... but when someone
(or a group) who can get XP from the mobs comes in the Bottom Feeder should
relinquish the spot.  Anyway, whether you agree or not, that's what I
believe and what I do.

#2 - Those annoying freaks who are 10th level with better items than my 51st
level Necro telling me that my Blackened Crystalline Robes suck.  When I
went to get my Summon Corpse spell from the Ishva Mal in Splitpaw, I was
lucky enough to get the Robes, too.  Now, I'd never use them as a Necro so I
gave them to an Enchanter friend of mine who was running around in an FBR.
After doing so, some 12th level Enchanter wearing an SMR came up to us and
told him that the Ishva Robe sucks.  Sure, when compared to the SMR it does,
but not when compared to the FBR.  It's that kind of "in your face" attitude
that I don't like from some (not all) twinks.  Twinking to me is okay, but
don't carry some sort of elitist attitude when you know that the character
who's equipping that item has not a chance in hell of earning it.  My 25th
level Wizard, who happens to be wearing the regular Crystalline Robe, is in
no position to tell someone who got a drop off of 40+ mob that his items
suck.

All in all, if you wanna run around all Twinked up, that's cool.  Do what
you gotta do.  But please, don't do it by bottom feeding from others who can
get XP and then don't carry some crazy attitude about it like you're the
shiznit.  Just be happy and play on.  =)
