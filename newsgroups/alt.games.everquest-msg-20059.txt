If you got pissed off enough to delete your character over a situation like
the one you describe, then maybe EQ isn't for you.
Trust me when I say, if you think this kind of situation is so devastating,
you've got a long, hard road of frustration ahead of you.  Almost all of us
have had similar situations when we were new, and back then I basically just
laughed at myself for my stupidity and pressed on.

me

what

Did you have fun up until that point?  If you did, it wasn't a waste of
time.  If you didn't have fun, then I'm at a loss why you play EQ.

If you get so upset over this kind of situation, you're going to love it
when you reach high levels and spend three days trying to drag your corpse
out of some hell hole
