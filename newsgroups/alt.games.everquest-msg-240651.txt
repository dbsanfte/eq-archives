PvE or PvP is not relevant. Cooperative or Competitive or even Single
Player is not relevant.

The idea that the only score on a PvE server is 'did the mob go down'
is precisely the limited thinking that has made EQ such a one
dimensional game for you, and has seemingly led you to beleive that
cheating up other aspects of the game to further this one is ok. If
you think  that is the only score in EQ then that's a trap you caught
yourself in. Expand your horizons.

They could PL you 100 AA in a week or so too. At that stage an AA as
much a commodity as the gear. The guild req's are in place primarily
to save them the hassle of PLing, backflagging, or equipping you.

A naked player with hundreds of AA and all his flags is less hassle to
bring up to speed... letting him loot rot drops and mooch from the
guild bank requires no effort... PLing AA or running backflag raids
take time... and time is the one thing these guilds don't like to
'waste'. So they prioritize their reqs based on 'time'...they require
time sinks to have been previously completed so they don't have to
help you:  flags, AA, epics (moreso a while ago than today), etc. 

Gear is a timesink too, but you can ramp that one up to adequate, as
you noted, pretty quickly, and more importantly  without diverting
guild effort from whatever it was they were already doing.

Yes because the advancement paths converge to 0.

This BS goes on at all levels of the game to one degree or another.
Its not limited to the high level guild.

And its the reason SOE is implementing instanced endgame encounters,
this BS is not part of the game SOE intended... its just fun-lessoning
politics that ego ridden twits have brought into the game.

Ultimately getting the best gear is the combination of having too much
time to play EQ and an exercise in patience. You do not need to be a
great player... adequate is plenty. With enough time anyone will gain
the required AAs and be in the right place at the right time with
enough luck or points or pity to be awarded a solid kit.

The primary reason the uberguilds are better equipped than the casual
players is simply because they've had more time in the game, and/or
maximized the use of that time to advance along the level/gear
curves... (vs say, banging their head against a quest for a few
days... or watching a Karana sunset...which are equally worthy goals
imo.)

A few guys at 27th  wearing only the stuff they looted from kills and
quests they performed - breaking and holding the King room in SolA is
more a test of skill and competence than the vast majority of the
performances delivered by endgame-raiders on an average night.

And I'd rather be in on that then a cog in the great raid machine of
many of the endgame raids. Its more of a challenge, and its more fun.
Certainly the endgame raids involve some more advanced strategy, but
the individual contribution once the fight is underway is largely
pretty mundane.

You've undermined one of your arguments. If 200K won't buy you access
to the end game... then its not much point buying to get to end game
is it?

And you are obviously not a programmer.

You grossly overrate a macro programs if you think a mass of bots with
a couple players is going to pass the Turing test.

But you have to contact the customer to advise them it dropped... or
is the guy going to pay 2000 to stand around for 30 or 100 raids?...
if he has *that* kind of time he's probably better off playing the
game himself.
