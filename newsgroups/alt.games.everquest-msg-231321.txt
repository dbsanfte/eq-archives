I think the problem is people have seen the ac/stats on high end gear
and unless they can solo reds constantly and plough through lvls so
quick their speakers burst they dont want to know.

Ive offered people items at lvl 20 something and been told firmly that
its crap..... when it dropped off some lvl 50 mob... I think peoples
expectations for gear is too high, and that unless it comes close they
feel its an insult.

sad really, I remember getting a file steel weapon too, it was uber to
me.
