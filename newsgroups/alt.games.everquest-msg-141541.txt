Thanks for the info, just noticed my cleric had reached 50 in speicalize
alteration, and I havent put any points into the others.

So I head to RV and put ONE point into the others, and begin casting my
healing spells.  When I check my Skills screen, it still says 50 but the
others say 51?!?!  How could this be, is this a bug? Trainer said skill was
30 after 1 practice point.
