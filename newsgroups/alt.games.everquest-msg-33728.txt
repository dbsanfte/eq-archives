I was in QH the other day and traded Breeze for a SoW with a Druid about
38th level, I think it was.  She said "Gotta run, late for a Vox raid."  I
told her good luck and we went on our way.

About 20 minutes later, I was in Everfrost and the raid was forming, I
guess.  The "leader" was shouting out who was in what team ( group ) and
some other guy kept shouting "I'M the one to pay.  Give me your money before
we go in."  "Everyone pay ME!"  "We're NOT going in until everyone pays!!"

Before I pass judgement (well, too late, the guys was an ass, as was obvious
by his presentation ), I'd like to know what they could be paying for.  If
they are paying for the right to go on a raid, that just seems ludicrous to
me.  BUT!  I've never done it, so maybe it -does- make sense.

Please let me know what might have been going on here.
