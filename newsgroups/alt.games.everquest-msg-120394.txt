That doesn't surprise me. You might consider 206 a lot, but think of
this: Non-Iksar have to hand in about 4000+ bonechips to get ok with
just *one* cabilis faction. Me as an Iksar Shaman, I'd have to kill
about 1000+ orcs to get into Freeport. Fixing faction to the opposite
of our religion isn't easy anywhere normally.

As for Katta, I can wander it freely now, I am amiably to the citizens
and warmly to guards (and glower still to *some* NPC's in houses ...
must be at least a third faction). What I initially did alone, was to
kill some 100 - 150 or so Marus Seru guards (wimp lvl 30's). That got
me to at least non KOS to the guards (Validus Custodus faction). The
citizens (Quest givers etc) would still kill me on sight (and let all
the guards join the fight). What happened then is I ended up in a
guild that hunted the bigger Sanctus Seru mobs (from Leggionaires to
Praesertums). Those also have citizen faction sometimes (at least some
of the guards of the Praesertums). That got me to my actual non KOS
status. You can however forget to kill Praesertums or their guards
without any stronger guild, as they are rather tough. I remember the
last Praesertum hitting me 6 times for 500 after I slowed :) And then
it teleported me into a prison of sorts. However, those bigger mobs
fixed faction after about 3-4 runs to Sanctus Seru, i.e. fast. I now
have this EB item as well.
