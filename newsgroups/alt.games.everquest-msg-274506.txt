you're a ninny.

Read the post.  From this you extrapolate and claim that I am *only* saying
that pussy is short for pussy cat???  And *ONLY* was used by you. It is a
direct reply and the reply is to:

"Pussy is not short for pussycat when calling someone a coward"


There are no intervening passages which would lead even a 5yr old astray, so
what's your excuse to interpretting my response as anything other than the
direct reply it was?

Oh I have it - you're too much of a pussy to own up to the fact that you
were distorting what I was saying.
