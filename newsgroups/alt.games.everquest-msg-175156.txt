I dunno about that.  I've never minded letting any caster know when
valuable buffs were fading.  How many buffs are you keeping on these
ingrates anyway?  If they're whining about having to ask for stat
buffs then let 'em do without the buffs, problem solved.  If you're
talking about more useful buffs, well I assume you keep your HP buff
on yourself as well, just cast on yourself first and when yours starts
to fade you'll know that the others will shortly do the same.  If
you're hasting the melees let 'em ask, they won't be shy.  You've met
some folks who're convinced that timing buffs is a big deal, I know
lots who just don't see it as particularly important.

Some folks use a kitchen timer (or equivalent) to keep track of when
buffs will wear off (you have to know what your buffs' durations are
and when you last cast them).  Plenty of other folks just don't sweat
small stuff like this.
