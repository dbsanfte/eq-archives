    Then you run into the exact same problem as we had originally: how do
you set the power levels of the upper and lower limits to be balanced
against what players may have from previous encounters? You're still going
to have to do a lot of thinking so your high isn't too low and your low
isn't too high.

    Having an encounter drop a large variety of items, whose power increases
as yours does (to a point), will mean players will spend more time on a
given encounter farming it. That'll lead to players bumping heads over
content a lot more frequently. Is that intended?

    Sure there is - they need to get the game out the door before the year
2121. ;-)
