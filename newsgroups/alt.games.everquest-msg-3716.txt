If you turn your Tome of Order and Discord in on a Team PvP server, my
understanding is that you can then kill people of your own Team who have
also turned it in to the PoD (I haven't met anyone who's done it yet on
Tallon).

That's just my theory.  I don't know for sure, as I always destroy my Tome
of Order & Discord.  If you do turn it in, I suspect that normal people on
your own Team cannot buff or heal, just like on the regular servers.  Again,
I don't know that for sure, just a theory.

I don't think it makes any difference on the individual PvP server.
