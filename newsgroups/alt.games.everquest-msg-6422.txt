: What...the.. FUCK?!?  What in the hell are you talking about here?
: Did the above have some sort of hidden meaning to you when you typed
: it in?  Did you eat enough lead-based paint chips as a child that the
: above paragraph actually has some hidden coherency in it to you?

 You know, I came into this late, but its hard to believe that there are
people over the age of 12 who don't have enough intelligence to follow
what he was saying.  If in the game, another character givs you something
to help you out then that person is being generous and you are quite
fortunate.  However, if you have one of your characters giving others
thousands of plat worth of "phat lewtz" (to put it in terms you'll
understand) then you are simply giving another of your characters an
unfair advantage.  There IS a difference between the kindess of strangers
and rules raping to get the best for your own personal graticification.

exterior transtemporal mechanics function when you're dealing with
omni-dimensional ripple effects triggered at the end of a continuum
