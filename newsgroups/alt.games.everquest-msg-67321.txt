Not a good analogy.  The speed limit is posted.  There is no posted
restriction against multi-questing, and at least one Verant rep has
said that they consider it part of the vision.  In addition I've had
guild members get help when a multi-quest failed due to a bug.  They
have NOT been helped when giving part of the required componants led
to the quest mob giving them something else.
