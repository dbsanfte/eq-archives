It's not that they're nerfing KEI in particular, it's that they're fixing 
the bug that allows someone to cast group buffs on characters under the 
appropriate level by inviting them to a group, the caster targets 
themselves to allow casting and the buff hits everybody in the group.

It basically looks like they're adding an additional level check for each 
person in the group (or area of MGB casts) when the spell actually finishes 
casting.

It's gonna suck having to use the rather short duration brilliance/insight 
on my tradeskill mules instead of a nice 4 hour KEI.  Otherwise, I kinda 
welcome the change.
