I know. Was being a smartass.

Hadn't thought of that use. My SK managed to fear kite decently with
just auto attack.

I quickly develop a feel for how long my weapon delay is when I get a
new toy, so I get by with stand/autoattack/sit. I also pretty much
only do it on snared unrooted mobs in flee mode, of course.

Useless? You don't take many screenshots, I take it.

Well, I started playing when the 7 - 0 hotkeys plain didn't exist, and
the only time I spend in original mode is whilst swapping spells.
