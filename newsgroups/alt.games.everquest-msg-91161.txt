Things have changed a BUNCH in a year.  I honestly can't remember staying 
up late for a CR in many, many months.  I did stay up 2 hours late for a 
third attempt at Trak many months ago, but I really wanted my VP key.  
Maybe it's different in a raid guild, but my unguilded friends don't seem 
to be losing a lot of sleep over corpse runs.  Yeah, when you're level 45 
and doing a pick-up Vox raid you may be up late, but that's something that 
most people do two or three times, total.  BFD.

If you're level 1 you certainly aren't going to be somewhere you need a 
coffin.  By the time you need coffins to recover, you should be able to 
afford them.  And buying coffins is trivial now.  You port to Nexes, run 
about 30 steps to Bazaar, and buy from one of the many merchants there 
selling them.  Then run back to Nexes and port back down.  Ohhh, there are 
about a dozen bankers in Bazaar too, so it's not like you don't have 
access to your money.

In DAOC they're not required?  I thought the exp penalty was bigger in 
DAOC than in EQ.  I know if I take an unrezzed death I'm looking at 
literally hours of grinding to get that exp back.  I can't think of ANY 
death that would take me more than hour to get back and get rezzed.  I 
have to get back to my corpse anyway, since I'm NOT going to give up 4 
hours of hard exp grinding, but with a 96% rez I'm only losing 20 minutes.  
I have literally hundreds of deaths, and I haven't lost a corpse since I 
was level 4.

I can't remember the last time I didn't get a petition answered.  I don't 
petition that often, but I always get an answer when I do.  In this case, 
as in almost any other, I was able to solve my problem before the Guide 
could even get there to investigate, but 15 minutes from petition to 
resetting bugged mob isn't too bad.

Oh boo-fucking-hoo, you'll lose a level.  OK, think this through.  In the 
worst case scenerio, penalty levels after a hell level, you can lose up to 
1 yellow bubble.  That's 20% of your exp for that level.  Now this is the 
absolute worst instance, and in most cases you lose less than 1/2 a yellow 
bubble.  So for basically 10% of the time you are in danger of dying and 
losing a level if you DON'T get a rez.  
You haven't played the game for over a year.  It really has changed 
significantly.  There are a LOT more 49+ clerics, and pallys with rez, and 
easy travel, and easily purchased coffins.  You're not going to see 50 
people in Lower Guk, but one of the 3 people soloing there probably has 
access to a rez-capable cleric.   
Every time people complain about how tough the death penalty is they 
either haven't played for a while, or are a fairly new player.  I think 
you'll find that it's not nearly as bad as you remember it.
