  That's an "update cd", not an actual Windows 95 to 98 upgrade.  In
order to use it, you already have to have Windows 98.  I did search
eBay, and pricewatch.com, and a few other pricing web sites, and the
best prices tended to hover in the $50-70 dollar range, and often in
those cases you're buying from less reputable dealers, individuals who
may take their sweet time shipping, or the item is out of stock, ect.
