Guilty.  I used to go kill the DE guards in Nektulos.  OTOH, I would help
out low level DEs that were trying to get to the now dead guards.  Of course
it all started because the silly guards would attack me, killed me the first
time I went through there when a goon jumped in.  After that, I decided that
it was my duty to rid the world of them, and sell their bronze swords while
I was at it.
