A lot of EQ2 players got that feeling right off the bat. You 
didn't mention what subclass your wife plays, but I would say at 
least 75% of all comments I saw the first couple of days of the 
changes were people complaining that they had been nerfed and/or 
the mobs made harder and now they couldn't go anywhere safely. 
Maybe 90%.

It's understandable that the changes felt that way right off, but 
actually it's completely wrong. The actual deal is that non-epic 
mobs were nerfed (their HP reduced) while epics and orange/red 
mobs were left as is or made harder -- idea being to increase the 
spread of mob challenge so that what to take on becomes a real 
question to ponder. After all just because we were all used to a 
single full group being able to take down epic "2-group" mobs 
doesn't mean that was good game design.

Meanwhile the player subclasses were altered, some of them quite a 
lot, which immediately felt like nerfage because the ways we were 
all used to playing no longer worked well. My main is a paladin 
and we were changed a great deal, we've really had to relearn our 
tactics. The official SoE boards were filled initially with 
furious pallies swearing they'd quit the game, never forgive SoE, 
etc. I've heard from guildies that several other subclasses were 
also changed quite a lot. It turns out (so far anyway) that once 
we realize that and experiment a bit and trade some tips, our 
toons are at least as strong as before relative to the non-epic 
mobs. And playing a paladin, for one example, is actually more fun 
now; the subclass is actually unique in its tactical setup not 
simply "guardian-lite-with-a-rez".

The changes improved the game in some other ways too, and EQ2 
retains its strengths such as the graphical richness and the 
questing. So your wife might want to spend some time browsing the 
boards for tips about how her subclass works now, and give it 
another try.
