Heh, my main main is on FV. He's a 58 bard, and I have no intention of 
even trying to 2-box with him. I put so much effort into playing him, 
that splitting my attention even a little would make me feel like a 
slacker. :P

Though I would enjoy levelling up another shaman, I would kind of like to 
try something else, really.

I really just don't like the idea of keeping a melee class on the 
sidelines so much of the time.

BL pets are more formidable that mage pets? I did not know that.

The tash, mana regen and CC aspect are what appeal to me most. In playing 
casters in the past, I remember resists really taking a bite out of my 
mana pool and making it more difficult for me to last through the entire 
fight before, say, my pet takes a dive.

Honestly, I'm leaning toward the necro right now. When just duoing, I can 
see the fights lasting long enough for a necro to flat out kill some 
major mob tail.

This was really just my only consideration for any sort of tanking class. 
I'm not too familiar on just how well the mage pets can tank. Can they 
really render a tank class unnecessary for a duo?

Again, keeping a DPS class out of the action so they can sit back and 
plink away? Hmm...doesn't sound too appealing to me.

Can't really see me going that route without a healer. You're pretty much 
resigning yourself to more downtime, I would think.

Kind of figured that might be the case. Another reason I started leaning 
toward necro - extra tank plus nasty damage capabilities.

Nah. I'm not wanting to concentrate on one class over the other here, so 
it would bother me to not really be playing the beastlord class the way 
it was meant to be played.

Aye. Aside from missing heals and maybe slows, I can't see where I could 
go too wrong.

Thanks a bunch for the input.
