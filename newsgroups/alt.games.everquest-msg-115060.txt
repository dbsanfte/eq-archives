Well, my wood elf rogue (my first char) got asked for sow in WFP once.
Funny thing is that i was not anon, wearing several pieces of Ravenscale 
armor (including BP, dead giveaway of me not being a druid), dual 
weilding 2 weapons (cant remember which, but 2 of the ones that looks 
like large harpoons, not some tiny daggers), and swaying from side to 
side from being dead drunk (training brewing so had to do something with 
the finished products). Since i was my first char, i had no idea of the 
scrambled text from being drunk, or that i could use emotes to 
communicate, so told him a few times that i wasnt a druid.
The guy stood in front of me for around 3 min asking 4 times for sow 
before he left again.
