You're using FSAA?  Not a good idea at all.  Turn it off and run
in DirectX mode.  You should have very few frame rate problems
after that.  BTW, if you're talking about stuttering screens and slow
framerates, you're not talking about lag at all.  Lag is a communication
problem, whereas frame rate drops and stuttering is a system
problem.
