Look through this thread...pick random posts and read them.  Note which
ones are the hardest to see what particular point the poster is responding
to.  Guess what?  It is your posts that are the most work for the reader
to deal with.

Also not which posts do not trim out material that is not being responded
to.  Hey, guess what?  Your posts are almost all in that group!

Think about this.
