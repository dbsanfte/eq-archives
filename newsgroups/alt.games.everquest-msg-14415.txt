I think you're being too harsh. It's worth at least a 5 or a 6. I mean, you
know, it's got heart, you know?

Seriously, it wasn't brilliantly written or planned, but through sheer
saturation it's had its effect. Just from this one newsgroup, I've seen that
quoted troll-post at least twenty times in its entirety, and new people keep
jumping in and quotiing the whole damn thing again.

Also I think he deserves points for getting some "real" responses. The more
people who respond unwittingly to a troll with a serious answer, the better
of a troll it was.
