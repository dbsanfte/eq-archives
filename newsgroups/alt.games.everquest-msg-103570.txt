actually that is fairly weak evidence. smoking roughly doubles your chance
of dying ( a little less than this but close) If your chance of dying
tomorrow was 10% this would be significant but since your chance of dying
tomorrow is roughly 1 in 22 million as a 25 year old it just dosent amount
to much :)
