That was some very useful information, thanks so much.
I will take this advice and forget about h2h and 2hB. The only reason I
thought this to be usful was after lvl 9 or 10  you loose all your inventory
and I hadn't purchase the Hammer of Wrath spell so I was without a weapon.
The first time this happened to me I had found my body and was just bending
over when I was attacked by a Puma.
