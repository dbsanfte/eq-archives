Heh, I've found very few places where I can get even one blue of xp
solo before KEI runs out, and they're either popular or won't support
many people.  So I don't pay for KEI *shrug*.  I just thought Dan's
claim that anybody under 55 who isn't satisfied with C1/C2 cast on
them in Nexus is spoiled was way overbroad, C1/C2 cast on me in Nexus
has almost no value, and I don't see it having much more than zero
value for non-porting casters either, in many/most instances at any
rate.  I suppose a 45 Mage who was gonna solo in DL would benefit
from the mana regen, just because it takes a mage a goodly chunk of
mana to power-up for fighting and he could get to DL and get set up
before C1 or C2 wore off.  But I'm having trouble coming up with any
other examples that don't involve a porter.  And believe it or not,
there are quite a few of us who are not Druids/Wizards and don't have
a bot Druid/Wizard servant and don't have a "regular group" that
includes a Druid/Wizard.  And, of course, all the Druids and Wizards
who whine about not getting groups are off soloing with the KEI they
paid for so we can't get them to join our groups anyway.  :-p
