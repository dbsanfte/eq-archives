Mine patched fine, I get popups from zonealarm in pop windowed and full
screen mode (no mouse since about 3 months ago but alt-r and altY do the
job).  I can switch between the two modes at this point fine if I have to.

This isnt a specific freebie zonealarm issue....it sounds like a weird
interaction which I did have after one patch (solution below)

If you really have a problem the safest workaround I can think of is fire
up EQ just as the patcher finishes, close zone alarm, ingame go to
windowed mode, minimise/reduce it - fire up the firewall, let EQ go
through it as it will need to minimise the firewall - go back in game..
