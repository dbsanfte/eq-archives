What do I need to get conjuration to in order to have a decent chance
of casting a level 49 conjuration-based spell as a 52 Wizard?

Mine was around 55 when I got SoL, and I've raised it to about 65 by
casting "Halo of Light" many many many times.  Over the course of
that, I've fizzled away four full bars worth of mana trying to summon
the familiar.
