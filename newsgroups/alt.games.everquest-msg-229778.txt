That's some good trimming, gimp. Could you possibly show yourself to
be any more clueless? LOL

Anyways...

Quick check of google shows most the top posting by one gimp named
TomG. Other than him, every single thread I checked on the google page
was filled with bottom posters.


>> >alt.comp.periphs.videocards.ati

Ditto, except no TomG this time. There were more topposters, and every
single one of them seemed to be clueless, without any regard for
context or trimming (sort of like you, noob).


>> >alt.internet.wireless

Virtually 100% bottom posters.


>> >aus.ads.forsale.computers.new
>> >aus.ads.forsale.computers.used

I leave these out because its normal for auction sites to toppost, by
the exception I mentioned earlier.


>> >comp.networks
>> >comp.os.-ms-windows.networking.windows

There's virtually no activity in either group. The biggest thread in
the first was four messages, the second was so dead google was giving
message bodies instead of just the titles.

And in both cases, there were still more bottom posters. :-)


>> >comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.networking

Again, vastly more bottom posters than not.


Did you bother to even check the newsgroups you threw out, you twit?
In case you didn't notice, you just got your arse handed to you.

Time for you to be slinking.... loser.

:-)
