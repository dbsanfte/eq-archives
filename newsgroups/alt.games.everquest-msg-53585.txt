Another PC please:
I gave a Drakkel Forged Icegrinder: 27/45 2hb with a proc called Ice Rend.

I gave it to my dwarf war alt, but didn't catch the "medium and large races
only" line. So I'm now stuck with it and have no idea what to do with it. I
heard that the Crystalline Eye I have from a shardwurm (Shardtooth maybe,
not sure), which is wis-casters only and has some pretty good resists, can
go for up to 7kpp. I was wondering if I could trade that one plus the hammer
as a sweetener for the GEB's. Do I have a chance or will I waste my time?
