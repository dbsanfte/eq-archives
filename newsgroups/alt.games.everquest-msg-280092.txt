I've never been interested in playing WoW but I've certainly
played the other two.  At least from what I've read here and
on their forums WoW seems to resemble EQ2 a lot more
than EQ but, no, I'm not positive.  Just my impression...

That's a difference in outlook - I saw marketing for EQ2 as very
different than EQ's.  I certainly didn't expect another EQ when I
bought the game.

Strange -- I've seen none of that in 50 levels of EQ2 (and all the heritage
quests) that comes even close to the same issues in EQ.   The flaws I
was talking about was training (griefing), buff beggers (and buff bots),
killstealing, etc.  They simply don't exist in EQ2.

Flagging?  Restricted to quest zones (ie, part of the quest even if
given a different name and shared among several quests) or raid
zones.  They DID have level restrictions on certain XP zones you
could bypass at an earlier level by a group quest -- but you did
get in simply by leveling and all the mobs would still be yellow
or better at that level.

Gear/level dependance?  I'm not sure what you mean.  A grouping
player can kill everything a raiding player can *for XP* wearing
nothing he didn't loot/craft himself.   A group of raiders would be
a bit faster - but not enough to make a difference that matters.
You don't see anything like the issues being discussed here with
groups asking HP/gear questions - even if you're grouping with
players from raiding guilds.   Just as an example:  the leading
cleric on my server (guildleader of the top raiding guild) has
different gear in *five* slots than a cleric I group with often - and
the cleric I group with duos 95% of the time...

Client/server stability?  Not sure what you're addressing.  They've
had a couple of bad patches - which wouldn't have changed if
they'd did a different game or "EQ right" or whatever.  That's a
SOE problem, not a game problem.

Yes, and ad hominem attacks make you look so smart in
comparison.   Are you seriously of the opinion SOE didn't
need to do *something* in the face of competion?

I think anyone who didn't see server consolidations coming
after the release of EQ2/WoW had their head in the sand.
EQ won't die as long as SOE wants to spend money on it
but it's not the rising star it once was.   It's an *old* game
and was before EQ2/WoW became viable projects.  SOE
*did* have to do *something* besides channel money into
an old title.
