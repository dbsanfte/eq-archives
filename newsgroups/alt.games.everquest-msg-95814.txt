While I was browsing ebay for a copy of Luclin for my bro I ran into dozens
of guides claiming how I a lvl 45 character can make 56k a day and other
"secrets". Now if these guides are actually legit I wouldn't mind spending
blowing $20 on one. But the question is, do they actually work, and if so
then which one do you guys recommend?
