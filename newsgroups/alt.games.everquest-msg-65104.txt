Some of the issues that you are describing "black bars obscuring the text on
buttons, flickering light effects at
> all times, and an outright black field of view in the default screen mode
(the other two modes are visible, but still sport the weird flickering
effect). The game goes in slow motion, from freeze to freeze." are known
issues that Verant is supposed to patch tonight. I would give it a couple of
days for them to work out all of the bugs before you started replacing
components on your computer. These are the same types of problems that came
up the last time Verant brought on a new land.
