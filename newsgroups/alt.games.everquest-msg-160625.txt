That's the one.  It's amazing to me that someone like that can put out a
book about how nasty and mean all those naughty liberals are, and commit
EVERY crime she's accusing the liberals of in the SAME BOOK SHE'S ACCUSING
THEM WITH!  Still some people drink it up, in a classic example of "It's
only ok if we do it".

The Liberals have been remarkably meek over the last three decades, given
the nastiness that started with the Newt gang.  If they've finally started
responding in kind, the Republicans have noone to blame but themselves.
