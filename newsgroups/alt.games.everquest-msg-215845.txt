As the group didn't get wiped, I'm led to believe that he was pulling
1 or 2 mobs at a time as was doing a pretty good job.  A shaman should
be able to keep the a 30's party healed with minimal downtime so I'm
led to suspect that some poor mana management was taking place and the
ML was slow.  I've been in groups where we handled 4 mobs at a time
with no med breaks and finished with 40 minutes left over.  (In one
the mage didn't get along with the enchanter and made a hotkey that
read "Aoeing a %T and breaking mezzes".)

I don't know about you, but if I can finish 2 LDoN adventures in the
time that it takes some slow groups to finish one, so much the better.
