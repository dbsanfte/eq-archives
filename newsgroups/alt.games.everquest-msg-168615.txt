Enchanters are sick at soloing :)  They can also easily be the number1

Post nerf they are definately underpowered IMO.  Pre-nerf well thats
debatable, I thought they were about fair (minus the shitty bugs with FD,
mend etc)

viable.  Add to that far easier obtainable snare weapons (than monks.. we
gotta get something from a mob like tunare)..  rogue > warrior for soloing

PoP changes bards melee massively.  Think enchanter/shaman who can melee as
good as a warrior with some PoP aa's and you have a bard...
