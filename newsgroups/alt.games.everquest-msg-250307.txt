The problem is, I doubt seriously that they're "just asking". Imagine the
internal politics around these ideas. Actually putting something in front of
every single player before they log on is not something done lightly, I
suspect there really needs to be a high level champion in favor of any
policy that gets presented in the form of a poll. I doubt they'd risk
generating harmful speculation over ideas that don't have a lot of internal
support. No, I think that if they've come to the point of putting up a poll,
some mighty internal forces are chomping at the bit to implement and this is
just one of the hurdles that needs to be overcome on the way toward
implementation, because someone in a meeting somewhere insisted that it was
a bad idea. The proponents are going to use the poll to show that most
people just don't give a damn, or are ok with the idea, and then they'll
move ahead.

I continue to believe that the powers that be within SOE have come to the
conclusion that they are leaving money on the table and are going against
the grain of market forces that are generating all of the revenues going
into the pocket of Yantis, et al. These market forces are very real and
people are spending money because there's a need that Yantis is filling, and
this revenue potential has got to be providing great ammunition for those
within SOE who are arguing to monetize it and stop worrying about piddling
details like "game integrity". There's money to be made, dammit!

Pure speculation on my part, based on 20 years of exposure to internal
corporate politics within software companies. ;-) It will be fascinating to
watch this play out over the next few months.
