Key excerpt, from email from Brad McQuaid to Itzlegend:

------  
Lastly, I'd like to point out a final factor that was taken into 
consideration when the severity of the punishment was devised. Let's look 
at the following guild chat snippet
                                     
(which certainly is NOT taken out of context):

Guildmember #1 told the guild, 'not if they nerf 3rd tomor ;( heh'
Guildmember #2 told the guild, 'they plan on nerfing 3rd?'
Guildmember #3 told the guild, 'yes tommorow syc'
Guildmember #3 told the guild, 'this is our LAST CHANCE'
Guildmember #2 told the guild, 'gah fuggin BS'
Guildmember #3 told the guild, 'so lets make sure we do it tonight'
Guildmember #2 told the guild, 'so no snare sploit?'
Guildmember #3 told the guild, 'nope'
Guildmember #4 told the guild, 'what are they doing to 3?'
Guildmember #4 told the guild, 'Killing snare sploit?'
Guildmember #3 told the guild, 'changing it so we cant snare sploit'
Guildmember #5 told the guild, 'LoS! Rez! Pathing! Agro! With our powers 
combine, we summon forth ITZLEGEND!'
Guildmember #6 told the guild, 'hehe'
Guildmember #7 told the guild, 'ROFL'
Guildmember #1 told the guild, 'we dont know that'
Guildmember #1 told the guild, 'its a rumor'
Guildmember #2 told the guild, 'i hope not sigh'
Guildmember #1 told the guild, 'dont go afk long'
Guildmember #1 told the guild, 'this isnt going to take long'
Guildmember #1 told the guild, 'we are just buffing healers and me'
Guildmember #8 told the guild, 'how would 3rd warder die then? zerg?'
Guildmember #1 told the guild, 'it wouldnt'
Guildmember #1 told the guild, 'not without 60 people anyways'

This tells me:
                                     
1. You knew the snare bug is an 'exploit.'
                                     
2. You'd heard a rumor that we were going to fix it soon and therefore 
wanted to exploit it ASAP
                                     
3. That Guildmember #1's 'clever tactics' include using pathing 
problems/bugs
                                     
4. That you knew the encounter would take 60 people were it approached 
conventionally
