Has there ever been any kind of stats compiled of who actually plays
the game and the percentages? Like, what percentage plays X number of
hours a week, what percentage belong to guilds who are Time/Elemental
plane capable, etc.?

I guess it would be kind of easy to compile stats for how many hours
a person plays, but there's a big difference in problems that a person
who is playing 20 hours per week and raiding in the Elemental planes
will see and a person who is playing 20 hours per week and spending
those 20 hours tradeskilling/grouping in LDoN or old-world zones/
soloing.
