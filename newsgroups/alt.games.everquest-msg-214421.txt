Items with a reccomended level tend to suck; they are usually not very good
for people the reccomended level or higher, but automatically nerf
themselves to also be relatively lame for lower levels.  If implemented
globally this would be an interesting solution to the Mudflation problem,
but since there is a wealth of regular items out there which a high level
can sell to low levels, having items which are nerfed down to what low
levels are "intended" to have competing with the ones that are all out of
balance is a cruel joke.

There are exceptions, particularly when you are looking at items with
effects; Flowing Thought, for example, works regardless of reccomended
level...

Anyway, when looking at a reccomended level item, its important to have the
character who is going to equip it do the looking, that way you'll see what
the actual stats he'll be getting are, as opposed to those that someone the
reccomened level or higher will get.

Nice thing about a "reccomended" item is that if you find one thats
reasonably good at your level, it does grow with you, so that you won't be
feeling so much like replacing it every few levels for the next thing, then
replacing that one with the next next thing...
