Not saying that the application has godlike intelligence, but Copeland's
and a lot of "conventional lore" disagrees with you. By that program,
the Lammy in the primary hand and CSS in offhand yields a damage rating
of 837 dmg/minute, but swapping them drops it to 789. A significant
drop. While your explanation certainly makes sense in one regard, I
think the other argument is that you're going to miss a certain
percentage of the time with either hand or weapon. The fact that the
primary hand *will* swing every time would indicate that you want it
swinging as fast and often as possible to maximise the number of hits
you'll get. The offhand will be swinging far less often, all other
things being equal, so the number of hits OR misses will have a lower
impact on the total damage being done. Seems most everything else I've
heard/read indicates that the lowest delay weapon should *always* be in
the primary hand.
  If you've found differently, I (and I imagine many others) would be
very interested in seeing the numbers used (specifically hard numbers
from testing over a period of fights) to support that point. If it's
just a general theory and a "I think I do more damage this way" sort of
thing, I don't know if I'd believe it.

Agreed. Besides, the concept of twin Lammys is just so cool and a bit of
a status symbol. :-)
