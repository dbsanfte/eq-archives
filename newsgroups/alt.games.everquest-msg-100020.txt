Just thought I'd pass on this little goober of a tactic that my ranger wife and I developed
in Stonebrunt.  It's probably not new, but I haven't seen anyone else do it.

It's basically a simple modification of fear kiting, where you're kiting in an area where you could
potentially get a lot of adds.

Here's how it goes:

1) Find a pull mob to a safe (off-pathing) spot.

2) Selo's Consonent Chain (or snare of you're grouped with a druid or ranger) the mob and the use
   Appalling Screech (can augment with Instill Doubt) to fear.  You can use other Fear spells, but
   because their spells have less predictable time lengths they'll stick, I wouldn't use them anywhere
   near the end of the kite run.

3) Fear kite mob to a location just short of where adds might start occurring.  Pull back to safe spot
    and let fear wear off.   Mob chases you to safe spot, hopefully without any adds yet.

4) Rinse and repeat.


The mobs we've fought in the pull location we found only need at most two times down the path to die.
But I can see if the mob had lots of hp's it would take more passes (like an HG maybe).
