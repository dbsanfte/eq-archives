I don't care if you don't care, I'm going to tell you anyway!  I'm
going to tell the WORLD, dammit!

I am now a fully paid-up resident of Qeynos again, with familiar hills
and familiar dales (and familiar Gnolls), and familiar hateful glowers
from the Human population - and it feels great.  You wouldn't believe
how a crap place can become so welcoming when you've been trapped
somewhere even more crap for a while.

However, in fairness, I have to say that I did not achieve this feat
without assistance.  And therefore, evil and nasty and malicious
little blue scumbag though I may be, credit where credit's due.  So
I'd like to say a big thank you to the following:

ECHUS - For the advice that saved my butt in Kithicor - thank you.
BRUNNER - For spending quarter of an hour of your valuable time trying
to find me and bind me in the labyrinth that is Highpass - thank you.

And last but not least, a brief but valuable encounter:

NYRO - For a SoW JUST when I needed it.  Thank you too.

Right.  I go.  You know how it is.  People to see, pockets to pick,
and so on...
