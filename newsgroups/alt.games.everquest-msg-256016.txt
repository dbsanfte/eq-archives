Special zones. Frontiers are areas anyone can get to and is open RvR,
Battlegrounds are level limited areas (usually 5 level range), and one
dungeon Darkness Falls. (there are dungeons in Frontier areas that are RvR
also).
Darkness Falls can only be entered by one realm at a time. The realm that
controls the most keeps from the frontier zones. Any other realm that is
inside DF when they logged or when the owner changed can stay until they die
and release.

Buf bots are usually a character that will stay at a safe spot and keep the
buffs on a character. Buffs in DAOC are (mostly) perma bufs until the buffie
or buffer zones or dies. Some buffs are proximity based, but most are just
concentration based (each caster gets a set amount of concentration points
for buffs)

Wardens are loved, but only if they are a "bubble" warden. Wardens get a
"blade turn" spell that becomes a pulsing (auto cast) spell later. Blade
turn completely stops a single hit from doing any damage (there are specific
attacks that can bypass this - all from one of the stealth classes).

Now for personal expierences and second hand (from my wife's perspective). I
enjoyed RvR in the battle grounds, it was a total blast, everyone I know who
played felt the same about this. "Real" RvR sucked unless you had the time
to devote to getting all the realm points (like AA's but only earned in
RvR), and now time to devote to Trials of Atlantis (TOA) relics etc. So I
stopped playing, wife continued.
She had 5 level 50's, shaman, shadowblade, necro, friar, enchanter, and
numerous 40's, she played 2 accounts so she had the ultimate bufbot in
midgard (shaman) so leveled up fast. She quit with New Frontiers, she said
all RvR has changed to casters + siege equipment people. Melee's can't get
anywhere near anything without getting ganked by a caster, trebuchet,
catapult, etc.

Mezing & stunning are huge in RvR since it usually takes one or two hits to
kill someone. As for the person who said Albs got the short end of the stick
on mezing, well they got the short end of the number of classes that get
mez, not on the ability. I once saw a level 50 sorcer, mez over 80 mids at
once, sure he could not kill us all, but he did stop us all.

RvR used to be great fun, maybe they will make it fun again, not sure. I am
sure you can still get groups close to other groups for combat, but it will
be much harder now.
