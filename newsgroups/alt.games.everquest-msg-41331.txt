I read your original post. It was quite clear: "For the past 2+ years,
we have had the *right* [emphasis added] to see how many people were
playing on our server". It doesn't seem particularly subject to
semantics.

I personally don't see it as a negative. I see it as a business
decision on the part of Verant/SOE. Specifically, a decision that is
none of *our* business.

The vast majority of the complaints I've seen about this look like
nothing more than whining for the sake of whining. I've yet to see any
strong evidence of this really having a negative effect on the player
population.
