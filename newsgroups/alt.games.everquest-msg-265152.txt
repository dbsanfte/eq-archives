I knew that. I just couldn't resist.

See... I think this is sillier. Telling me some guy following you around 
killing mobs you haven't actually engaged is on par with a stalker 
following a woman for 17 blocks isn't going to fly. 

I think the trivialness of my toaster metaphor is more appropriate.

Regardless, the *problem* is that the mechanics allow for a form of kill 
stealing that is outside what the developers have decided to call 
killstealing. However, I'd find it annoying if it happened even once, 
and I call it kill stealing, and so would most reasonable players. And 
its objectionable.

If our 'harasser' instead of following one guy around, switched to a new 
'victim' every engagement his systematic engagement of boss mobs would 
be the same, and yet it would be perfectly fine, because he wasn't 
harrassing anyone.

I call BS. He's exploiting the policy and the mechanics. The game and/or 
the policy needs a revision.

I highly doubt that the activity cited would qualify as harrassment in a 
court. Thus the policy's definition of harrassment might not even apply, 
depending on just what it means by 'harrassment'.

If I engage 4 mobs, intent on killing all of them, and you pull one away 
and kill it. You killstole. I don't much care about the 'mechanics of 
the game'. Hell... if I do all the work to SPAWN a mob, and you kill it, 
I consider it a kill steal. And even EQs pnp doesn't cover that... but 
you'll find most players will respect a triggered spawn, or even a rare 
spawn at a static point that someone has been consistently killing PHs 
for over the last while.

Redefining the terms so that peoples legitimate complaints don't exist 
is Orwellian doublespeak at its finest.
