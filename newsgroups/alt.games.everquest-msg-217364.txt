FYI,

It does not matter if the MLer goes LD with regard to No Rent No Drop 
collection items.  As long as they are LOOTED off corpses by someone, 
it counts.  Multiple people can loot the items and it all goes toward
the
same tally.  

E.g.  Sally the cleric loots 10 of the 27 needed collected items. 
Frank the
Pally loots 14.  Jimmy the rogue loots 3.  Now Frank goes LD right
before Jimmy
loots the 3rd and last item needed.  The adventure is completed
successfully.  All members get points.  When Frank logs back in, he
will received a message saying adventure over (Successful) and receive
all 51 points.

Its almost as if Sony fired their last group of developers and allowed
actual players to design this LDON expansion!
