I would just like to point out that Sgt. Slate is a SERIOUS underson. He
conned blue to me last night, (yes...... I gave up hope on the orc pawns and
started helping an evil guildie kill Militia guards.) so I told her to meet
me at the zone line and I'd pull Slate to there.  I think I zoned less than
thirty seconds later with less than a bubble of life, the wizard hadn't
landed a single nuke that stuck on him, and I hadn't taken him down one full
bubble of health yet.
  Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay underconnned.
