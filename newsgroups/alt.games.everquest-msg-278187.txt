Subscription Rates Increase

Due to the increased costs of running the EverQuest game service, we
will be increasing our subscription rates in June. Effective June 12,
2005, the new monthly subscription rate will be $14.99/month. While
this announcement may be unpleasant, the cost of operating a top tier
MMO has increased significantly over the past three years and this
change will help us achieve our goal of seeing that every player has a
consistently enjoyable experience in the world of EverQuest. We will
continue to offer discounts from the new rate plan on multi-month
subscriptions. The new price for a 3-month subscription will be $41.97,
a 6-month subscription will now be $77.94 and a 12-month subscription
will now be $143.88. The 24-month subscription will continue to be
$199.95. You don't have to do a thing; you will automatically be
migrated to the new billing structure under your current subscription
plan when your current subscription plan expires. Subscription rates
are subject to tax and value-added taxes, as applicable. These price
increases will not affect the SOE Station Access? subscription rate.

New EverQuest rates as of June 12, 2005:

    * $14.99 per Month
    * $41.97 for 3 Months
    * $77.94 for 6 Months
    * $143.88 for 12 Months
    * $199.95 for 24 Months


Additionally we'd like to thank our current EverQuest players by
offering a 6 and 12-month limited time promotional offer. For a limited
time only, you can take advantage of 6 or 12-month promotional
subscriptions and reap great savings. Between May 12th and June 11th,
2005, we're offering a special discount on the new monthly subscription
price:

    * A 6-month subscription costs only US$69.99 ? that's a 10%
discount off of the new monthly plan.
    * Even better, a 12-month subscription costs US$99.99 ? a 31%
discount off of the new monthly rates.

And for those customers subscribing to other great SOE games this is
also an excellent time to become Station Access Members. The Station
Access subscription provides an easy gateway for SOE fans to a variety
of SOE titles for $21.99 a month. The Station Access subscription is
good for EverQuest, PlanetSide, EverQuest Online Adventures, EverQuest
II, Star Wars Galaxies and the Station Pass games.

EverQuest subscriptions are recurring, meaning you will continue to be
billed at the appropriate interval, until you affirmatively cancel your
subscription. Note that purchasers of the full game will receive 30
days of game-play included with the purchase at no additional charge
(subject to certain restrictions) after supplying valid billing
information. If you cancel your subscription during the period of 30
days of game-play included with purchase, no charges will be made to
your credit card.

Subscriptions are subject to tax and value-added tax, as applicable.

All subscription fees will appear on your credit card statement under
the heading "SOE*EverQuest".

Please note:

The subscription charges are in addition to the cost of the game. You
will need to purchase a copy of the game from a retail store or online
at the Station Store (http://store.station.sony.com). The price of the
game will vary depending upon the store.

The wonderful thing about this announcement is... right now the login
servers are down (7PM Pacific) and people can't log in.  Guess they
need that increase afterall since the servers are shoddy, right? ;p
