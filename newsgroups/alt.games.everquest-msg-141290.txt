sounds like this is your first character.  Don't worry about getting 
good drops right now.  Concentrate on just getting some levels.  The 
drops will happen eventually.  Personally, I've been playing for a year 
and only seen really good drops on a raid I went on in Mistmoore, that 
character (my first!) is only 38 and since I was a tagalong I didn't get 
anything except some money at the end.
You can try looking up stuff at everquest.allakhazam.com, I like to ask 
people what they are wearing if it looks interesting and look up where 
it drops and other info on it.
Also, at 18 you can get some awesome xp on Luclin in Paludal caverns. 
Look up the 'register for trading' quest in Shadowhaven and do it to the 
  end, you'll want the necklace.  Once you complete that you can train 
and sell in SH with no problems.  Head on in to Paludal and try to get 
in a group at either of the bandit camps.  The bandits drop bronze armor 
you can either use or sell.  The 'sullied' swords are junk and don't 
sell high to merchants, only take up the space and weight if you are 
desparately poor or your strength is through the roof.

Good luck
