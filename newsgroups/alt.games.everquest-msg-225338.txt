 >Did you get buffs on top of this?  Circle of Seasons etc.

Yes. Ended up in the 140 range for both. (Probably 137
and 139, but I can't recall exactly. 137 sticks out in
my brain.)

Aaah. I forgot about the Fear. I didn't get feared so I
was definitely in range for all that came after. I'm guessing
it was the healing that didn't get done on me. And, like
I said, that's fine, I was expendable. :)

Thanks
