Does the elapsed time matter if the player (now an NPC) is on any mob's
hate list? I still recall a nasty train in Seb jail where our Rogue went
LD on a big pull. He stayed in there fighting away for a looooooong
time. In fact, the only thing that stopped that cycle was the last mob
running over the ledge and down into the water (with the Rogue bravely
leaping in after him) and the subsequent train from hell wiping the
party, rogue included.
