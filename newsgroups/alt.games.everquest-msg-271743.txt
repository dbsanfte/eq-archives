Unless the weapons are totaly uber, your pet wont do any more damage with 
better weapons.
What you can do tho, is equip him with weapons that proc.

Go to the bazaar and get some summoned mage weapons, or a couple of cheapies 
like gnoll hide lariats (proc stun).
Some of the summoned mage weapons need high level pets to proc so you need 
to check that out. for example, the very top mage weapons need a level 60+ 
pet to proc.
iirc hand of ixiblat procs at pretty low level, but im not certain of this.

The only downside is your pet will generate plenty of agro, so agro kiting 
becomes difficult. You will probably have to fear kite.

Perhaps a magician could enlighten us?
