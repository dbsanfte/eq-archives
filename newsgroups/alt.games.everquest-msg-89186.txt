EQ wins...

First-person vs wierd iso-view (that fake 3d iso-view may look kewl on your
Sega or SNES... put this IS the 21st Century) ;o)

No PvP if you don't want it... but more than one flavour for those that DO
;o)

Limited character types... (not everyone's a cookie-cutter WarriorMage after
3 months)


EQ's not perfect... but it's _currently_ the best.
How long for, is anyone's guess :o/
