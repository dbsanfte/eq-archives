Yep, the same is true of having "enough mana"; I've often argued
that focussing on increasing your characters mana pool isn't the
most important thing you can do, even for a mana reliant
character; mana pool won't kill mobs per hour, only mana regen
and mana efficiency will.

You need to have enough mana to get thru each fight, but once you
have that much, the question is how fast you get what you spent
back, not how much you had at any given point.

Careful, he doesn't like being told he agrees with me.

There are forms of HP regen that aren't mana based; natural, gear
based, AA based, bard song, and even bind wounds and mend.  They
still are important in the same way mana regen is important while
mana pool isn't so much; you can't use more per hour than you get
in per hour... and you want to use as much of what you can get as
you can, sitting around FHP wastes your regen
