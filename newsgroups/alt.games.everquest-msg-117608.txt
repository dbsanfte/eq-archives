Ok, you almost got this right.  You positioned your "pickup" guy
in the spot, and then brought your "drop" guy in to the same spot.

But you could have minimized ground time still further.  Sit, camp,
get your drop item ready..and wait till the timer hits 5 seconds.  Now
that item is going to be on the ground as little as possible.

You could also have gone around back of a building instead of middle
of the platform next to a pole.  Dropped bags are enourmous and
easily visible, very tempting targets.

The word you are looking for is Twink, not Tweek.

I've had this happen more than once, myself.  Its just the risk you
run in deciding not do "do it right" by handing off to a guildmate
or buddy.  I -still- drop bags on the ground despite probably several
Kpp in losses over the years.  95% of the time with a few minimal
precautions it works, and I'm never dropping anything -vital- to me
this way.
