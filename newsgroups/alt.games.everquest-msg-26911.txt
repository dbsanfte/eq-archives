Hello I wrote to eq about the transfer deal and this is the reply they
sent the next day.  I can see their point and I appreciate the quick
reply to my email, but I must say I'm a bit disappointed.  I though
you guys would like to know the official story.  So here is their
answer:

Thank you for contacting Sony Online Entertainment Customer Service 
department.

The transfer service should be up in about 2 weeks for the service 
again. 

We decided it was in the best interest of the EverQuest community to 
only move characters without items, coins or the contents of their
bank.
If we permitted characters to move with their items, coins and the 
contents of their bank, it would affect the economy and item balance
on 
their new server. Server economies vary and a move to a different
server
by a high level character or a large guild could completely change the
economy on that server and could also drastically affect the gameplay 
and game balance.

No drop items are a part of the economy and will also not be moved
with 
a character transfer. Just the appearance of a new high level
character 
on a server can have a dramatic effect on the social and economic 
properties of that server.  Allowing no-drop items to suddenly appear
on
a server where perhaps only a few, or none, have been gathered yet 
impacts those that were on that server already.  No, that person 
couldn't sell these items for some unreasonably high price on the new 
server, since they are no drop.  But those items affect the culture on
a
server.  And many no-drop items are stepping stones for large quest 
rewards.  It would be possible to transfer with quest items that would
make gaining certain items, such as epic items, much easier to get on 
the new server if that server wasn't mature enough for the characters
to
tackle certain obstacles that were more easily tackled on another 
server.

We also have to consider the reasons that people move.  Folks moving
to 
join friends on a different server will have people there to help them
recover their items.  People moving to escape a bad reputation won't.

We understand that this service will not appeal to all of our
customers.
But it will appeal to many, and this is the form for that service that
has the least negative impact on those that don't use it, which is the
majority of our customers.
