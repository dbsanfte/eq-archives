   Um, you do know that this is a repost, right?  As it says in the title?  Ben
didn't write this.  He might agree with it, or some of it, or none of it, just
thinks it's interesting.  I dunno, and neither do you.

   And if you did know that... well, you sure spent alot of time flaming a post
when the author is most likely never going to see it.  And using the word "you"
as though you were addressing Ben.

   As flames go, this was an even bigger waste of time than usual.  Good job!
