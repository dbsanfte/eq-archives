I would have been happier with the boats if:

1.  They were closer together (either by putting more in,
or by making them go faster) - say 15 minute seperation.

2.  They should have moved faster once the passengers all
zoned - the boat from TD to FV is the right speed.

3.  There should have been an NPC at each dock that, when
hailed, would give you the approximate time to the next boat.
