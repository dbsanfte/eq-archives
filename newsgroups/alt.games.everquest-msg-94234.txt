I hear ya. On Sunday I had a raid planned for our guild in CoM to get
Jade reavers for the druids and rangers. Since Orlun left EQ, we have
only one post fifty rogue in our guild, and he's not a hyperactive
player. Turns out he didn't log on until hours after the raid was
planned.

No rogue. No raid. Two dozen 50+ players sitting on their fucking hands
in CoM killing green crap for two hours, only to give up in frustration
and wander off to do other things. Small guilds face unique challenges
that big guilds with a nice stable of all the key classes don't have to
worry about.

We had an xp group all set to go into Seb a coule weeks ago. Really nice
group, with Warrior, Cleric, Monk, Druid, Shammy.  The chanter didn't
show up. We went elsewhere. Kind of depressing. And yes, once you get to
a high enough level, you can do a lot of the camps there without a
chanter or bard. But when it's five folks who are 49 to 54 with me being
the highest one, you're asking for a lot pain to camp Guards there with
no chanter.
