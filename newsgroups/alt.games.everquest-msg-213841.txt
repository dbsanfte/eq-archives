Thanks for the advice so far Just logged off Next time I logI will try
your suggestions.  And yes working in dungeons is definatly "Hard"
total concentration with groups.  Since am in groups I have not lost a
player yet (Guess thats good) I mezz, debuff, slow and if neccesary I
nuke (Right?) . Im not as "Gutsy" as other players.  Just for the
record I did die 3 times in CC (Stupidity)  Lucky I had a freinds
cleric to rez.  Learning is fun.  At first I thought I would not like
enchanter, now im getting used to it.. I have a 54 druid and obviusly
a different way to play.  Im afraid at times.  I dont want my group
feeling I dont know what im doing.  Unfortunately im still learning
and hope to do  better
On a different note I have not yet started on skills Jewelcraft etc.
To late or which ones important now (Priority)

Do enchanters have DOTs?  I think that Suffocate is one Are there
others?
Loooking forward to hearing from you guys
