The sooner they start the solo LDoNs, the better. Just finished an easy
collect with a mage, warrior, cleric, shaman, ranger, and myself, a
beastlord. We had 10 minutes to spare.

Cleric (who didn't have lull, soothe, or pacify in his spellbook) bailed
just before we zoned in. Warrior switched to his paladin. Mage was ML, but
that didn't stop the shaman and ranger looting everything in sight. Even
tried to deny it, even though they had autosplit on. Shaman (now the main
healer) spent most of his time meleeing, and refused to canni saying "but I
lose hps" - he was pretty much oom most of the time. Ranger wouldn't snare.
Mage kept forgetting to loot, and also forgot to send pet in half the time.

So even though I repeatedly told the various people to quit looting, loot,
snare, quit meleeing, canni, etc. it didn't make a blind bit of difference.
I think I was playing with a group of goldfish. Had to explain 5 times to
the ML (who had gated back to PoK to sell) that he had to be in the same
zone as the rest of us in order to split. Explained 4 times the syntax of
the /split command.

Newbies I don't mind playing with, as long as they are willing to learn.
Noobs who don't fucking listen piss me off something chronic.

I blame Temp. It turns every bloody noob into a wannabe tank, so they have
no sodding clue as to what their class "should" bring to a group. Once (if)
they get high enough, the same will happen with virtue.

Time to use that buddy key and start 2 boxing, methinks.
