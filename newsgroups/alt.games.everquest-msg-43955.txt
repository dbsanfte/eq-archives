I have a level 32 Druid and soloing is easy in Kunark. Get your butt over to
Lake of Ill Omen or to Warslik Woods. Easy solos in there and those zones
are consider Newbie zones so XP bonus is in effect. Just watch the spiders
in FV. I would also buy your lvl 29 spells before you go. Lots of PP to be
made for ports from Kunark back to the other continents.
