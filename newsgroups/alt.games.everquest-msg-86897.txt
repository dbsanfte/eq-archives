He was just an aquaintence, the people helping him camp it were people I'd 
hunted with a bit.  One of the clerics helping him is a friend, and is 
planning on trialing with my guild in the next several weeks.  
I've since found out that this cleric did attend several raids with my 
guild, and did get PoG BP and legs from us, so that may be another 
reason that he is disappointed but not ranting about how we screwed him.

I think that Ragefire is now going to be exactly like Sev on Innoruuk.  If 
you want him, get your force there first and kill him.  Not the best 
solution, and one that really does favor the larger and more organized 
guilds.  We were able to go from one twink to 40 buffed members in zone in 
about 8 minutes, literally.  Had we not been still rezzing the dead from 
the Juggs train (lair Juggs respawned between killin Protector and rushing 
Trak), we would have been there even faster.  Not many guilds can mass a 
force that quickly, and even the biggest guilds rarely move that fast.  
(We had 2/3 of our active playerbase there, grouped, and buffed in under 
10 minutes, pretty impressive if you think about it.)
With the old way, if you wanted Ragefire, you got a core group who would 
stay up with you camping and keeping FGs clear, and another group who 
would respond at a moment's notice.  We kept everyone camped in the lair, 
so when he spawned, we just had folks log in, no need for CoH or fighting 
through the FGs, and by the time anyone notices a force has assembled, 
they're too far out, with too many mobs in the way to really interfere.  
Now the poor bastard spawns in a zone that has easy teleport access, no 
mobs to guard the camp, and really no way to deal with conflict other than 
call in the GMs.  Crap.
