Hmm nah . Anarchy is libertarianism taken to its illogical end . A more
acurate picture of conservatism taken to its illogical end would be a
theocracy.

I have also never heard a good definition of the diffrences between
communism and socialism . I consider both to be systems that advocate
goverment owned , and controlled production. Facism being goverment
controlled privately owned production . Capitalism being privately owned and
controlled production.
