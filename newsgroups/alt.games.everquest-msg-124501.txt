I soloed off and on from level 1 to level 53, never ran into any levels that
were particularly difficult for soloing.  With the exception of taking on
Freeport Militia when they were lt blue and very low dark blue, I did not
use my pet for soloing, I found kiting at early levels, then root and rot to
be far more effective.  I have done a small amount of soloing dark blue
rockhoppers, and had no trouble with them, but I do spend most of my time
grouping, tradeskilling, or playing twinks.
