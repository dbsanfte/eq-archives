I refer the honourable gentleman, to Mark Lawton's reply.

I've used the Demon/BT surftime deal since it came out. 40 quid a month
is quite a lot considering, but Demon's service is all right and the
connection is stable. That and it's a steal compared to paying for your
EQ fix by the minute. 

I'm pretty sure there are similar deals around with other more
specialist ISPs, who will give you as a gamer, what you want; a solid,
fast (relatively) connection with a minimum of hindering crap.
