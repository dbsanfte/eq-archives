Of course I would.  If I like chatting with them, there is always a chance
I'll enjoy then in person.  I've learned the hard way though not to get
too attached to someone until I've known them IRL a little.  last time I
did that I wasted 2 years of my life and walked away with 6K in credit
card debts that weren't mine. :P

I've only met one EQ friend, and that was when we were all the way across
the country visiting a friend's wedding and happened to drive by our EQ
buddies house.  If I could find other EQ folks in the SF Bay area I liked,
I'd follow up on it, but no luck so far.

That hasn't happened yet to me. :)  Just as well, because there are no
"missing voids" insofar as men are concerned (to ask for that is just
inviting trouble with my husband), and I've yet to find any female EQ
players that I have bonded with.  Real shame, because that's the sort of
friendship I'm missing...girl pals.
