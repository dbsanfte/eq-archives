Heh... I'm in OoT yesterday morning with my then 21 Necro camping the
gargoyles. Some /ooc messages start popping up from a very angry druid
about the boats being "bugged". (Shocking, I know.) It quickly becomes
apparant that he got the "zone in and float up to the top of the mast
and fall" bug. But apparently he *died* from the fall, and was bitching
because he has no idea where his corpse is, and he had 212 Plat on it,
some staff (nothing spectacular, but good twink gear) and a robe of some
sort. 

Not many people in the zone, so I explain to him that his corpse is
probably at the bottom of the ocean where the boat zones over and why.
He asks what he can do, and I offer him the options of petitioning or
riding it up near the zone line and swimming around trying his /corpse
command.

Short pause, and he tells me that it says he doesn't have a corpse in
zone.

Hrmmmm...

/who Druid_01

Level one.

I stop laughing and ask him, "So, basically you made a level one WE
Druid, twinked the hell out of him, and immediately jumped on a boat for
Freeport?"

"Yeah, I like that area better. Can I petition?"

"Yes, you can always petition. But you're also screwed."
