I made a lot of plat on Genoids in Crystal Caverns. Easy to kill and will
still give some exp at lvl 50. Every so often a focus gem and gem collector
spawns, these both can drop expensive gems (diamonds/Black Sapphires). All
the genoids have chance of dropping plat and some gems and there is
convenient bank nearby. If you doing well and no one else in zone, nip into
spiders and slaughter them, sell the stacks of silk to people doing
tailoring.
