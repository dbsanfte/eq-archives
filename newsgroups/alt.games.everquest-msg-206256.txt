Start saving your pennies for diety cultural armor. When I got serious
about playing Sheava and getting her out of druid twink gear, one
wrist, legs, and breastplate added almost 100 AC on the spot for about
20k. They made a huge difference. If you can't afford that yet, make
it a goal.

Also, feel free to take a look at Sheava's Magelo. Nearly everything
she's wearing is still droppable and not horrendously expensive.
