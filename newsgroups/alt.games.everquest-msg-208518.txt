Bah, guess I shoulda read ahead to see this.  I apologize for confusing
you and Howard, yes I replied to him, but somehow I got it in my head
that your earlier post was also by him (as is apparent from my response
to your response to me).  Anyhow, your posts seem far more rational and
good humored than most in the group and I wanted to be clear that I'm
not trying to dis you.  I've certainly believed things about EQ that
were subsequently proven false, and this question (IS vs. tradeskills)
seems to be still unresolved.
