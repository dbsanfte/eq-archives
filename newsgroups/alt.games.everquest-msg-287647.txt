So it's probably been 4 or 5 years since I last played EQ.  I was
having a bit of a hankering to go play again.  I mostly played an
enchanter back in the day - was lv 54 at the time, and did a lot of
charm soloing.  Is that still viable?

Does EQ still exist?

Is EQ 1 or 2 better?

If not are there any games out there that have the equivalent of
enchanter charm soloing?

Thanks,
