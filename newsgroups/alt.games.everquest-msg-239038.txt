I am so very proud of our guild right now. I joined my guild about
a year ago. When I joined, it was (and still is, I guess) a smallish,
mostly-rping-but-not-fanatical-about-it, casual, family-type guild.
It's a pretty unique guild in one or two ways with things going on
that don't normally happen in other guilds. At the time I joined,
the 'older' members were, at the most, in their early- to mid-50's.
They weren't new players. In fact, most had been playing at least
2 years by that point, IIRC. But, their play styles and their in-
terests had kept their levelling down a bit but that was okay. They
were enjoying their journey. When I joined, not one person had their
epic.

Today, we have a small core group of level 65 players (I think 6 or
7 altogether), and a much larger group in their late-50's and early-
60's. We are searching out and learning and conquering areas that
weren't possible for the guild a year ago and enjoying every second
of it.

But, to get back to the subject of the post, we have helped four of
our members get the cleric epic and, yesterday, with the guild's help,
I received Swiftwind. I am only one short (but dreaded) step from
Earthcaller. A year ago when I started with the guild, I was told
that when it came down to my epic, I would get all the help they
could give me but some things just weren't possible for them.

That has changed tremendously and I'm very proud of our guild. :)

Tracey
