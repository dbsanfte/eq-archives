I have to disagree on this point. I like the concept as well but have
yet seen a good implementation of it. IMHO, many of the
classless/levelless systems that ive seen, people tend to choose very
similar skill sets and end up being copies of the same character (as
in Tank Mages of UO - although i havent played UO in a very long
time). EQs stength in my opionion is that the classes are varied and
each bring different facets to the table and how the classes work well
together. You cant tell me that an enchanter and a warrior are
essentially the same character (once you get past level 10 say). Im
curious on how this will pan out in SWG.

Daggerfall had an intriguing customizable spell and class system. Id
love to see a high end online game try this. You could create your own
classes and spells by picking the attributes and abilities. The more
you picked, the more expensive it became. So if you loaded up your
class with tons of abilities and skills, it would take forever to
level up.
