The ones that drop at random are generally Type 7 augments. To get the
other types, you generally have to buy them with Adventure Points.

Most non-LDoN gear has one slot, Type 7. Some Plane of Time loot has a
single Type 8 slot which accepts more uber augments.

A good rule of thumb is to put the augments you consider the most
valuable on the gear you consider most valuable.

What is considered a major augment changes as levels change. I've seen
plenty of +6 INT and WIS augments rot while STA, HP, and mana are
highly in demand.
