Hi All,

I am having a frustrating keyboard problem and it seems to have started
either after downloading part of the new expansion or afyer some recent
(with in the last10 days) patch. Basically, my Shift keys seem to have been
disabled and/or remapped making my directional arrow keys a Shift+up (down,
etc.). Sometime the Up arow makes me auto run and I cannot click JBoot or
Circlet of Shadows in the inventory slot if I'm moving. Others have said
they are having problems with the arrow keys too. Has anyone else noticed
this? Has there been a fix? Any comments are appreciated. Thanks!
