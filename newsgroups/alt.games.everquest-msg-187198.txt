Except the OP is talking about specific posts by a known troll that 
people reply to for no other reason than to appear 'witty'.  And add to 
the noise of EQ with a bunch of religious garbage (and I AM religious, 
btw, so don't start), cross-posted to a dozen groups.  The problem is, 
it's not only AGE people replying, although there *are* some culprits in 
here ::eyes them::  Anyway, there's a huge difference between an 
interesting discussion (ie the topic of truffles) and a noisy, pointless 
flamewar in which nobody's mind is changed and the original troll gets 
his jollies seeing what a mess he's making of several groups.
