And that is the beauty of it.
When playing my rogue as long as the main TANK is closest (some need to be
told)
I never miss a backstab because the mob turned on me because I didn't evade
sooner.
Frequent evades contuniue to drop me down the hate list
Other melee can also hit from behind and not be dodged blocked riposted ie
monks love it.
Rooted snared 100% easy aggro management.
When root breaks if you have done the most damage and have not been evading
you are lunch.
But that has nothing to do with a mob being rooted.

Yep make sure Tank is kissing the mob then np.

As far as taunt not working, I have heard that taunt does not accumulate as
evade does.
I have heard it does accumulate so tank needs 2 taunts before breaking mez.
Never played a tank, well past 16, so cannot comment
I do think that unless the mob has another pc on top of its hate list it has
no effect other than to increase skill.

aye slowed mob hasted daggers is a lovely thing.
