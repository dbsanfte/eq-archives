It only helps if you're set to RP or Anon.  Some people do a /who all Druid
and just go through whatever names come up.  I think some even go through
from top to bottom, without even checking level, I mean, your name *is* on
the list, right?  I've had people bug my level 19 Druids for ports to
Skyshrine.  From halfway around the world.  Since I solo, and don't have
Regen yet, I keep Treeform memm'd for two reasons - it adds a good dose of
regeneration if I get tromped, and it's useful for repelling beggars. 
Nothing seems to say "Go soak your head!" like actually saying it, turning
into a tree, and /ignoring them.  If I'm busy or OOM, and I say so, someone
calling me names isn't going to change the fact.  It's also helpful because
in the areas I hunt, many things are still spoofed by lesser illusions like
Treeform.  Nothing is as satisfying as seeing the jerk attempt to train me
for not SoW'ing him, and then getting himself killed when he either can't
remember which tree I am (and I often move as soon as they are out of
sight) or when the mob ignores me because I'm a tree.
