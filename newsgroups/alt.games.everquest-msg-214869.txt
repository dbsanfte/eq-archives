Sounds like just the sort of rumor you would love to believe, Freek,
given your insane irrational hatred of EQ and Sony.

Ask yourself this - if this were true, what would happen to EQ if
Yantis decided to suddenly go public with what they were doing?

If you think about that, you'll understand why your rumor is so
unlikely.

Btw playerauctions may have a lot of auctions, but things actually
SELLING are another story.
