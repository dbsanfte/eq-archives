You could do your rain caller quest.  It's a decent upgrade to the trueshot 
longbow.  But if you have gear that the lvl 55s are drooling over then you 
probably already have better :P

You've basically stumbled across mudflation.  Whereby it's possible to buy 
nice gear that's much better than anything you can quest or loot at your 
level.

If you have gear that's appropriate for a level 55 character, I'd suggest 
leveling up to 55 and then start looking for upgrades and quests to do that 
will improve your gear.  Although by that time you'll probably be able to 
buy gear that'll take you to 65 and will be nicer than anything you'll be 
able to quest or loot.

Since you seem to be into tradeskills, you might start working on your 
coldain shawls and rings (you'll need friends to help with the later 
versions of these).

I'm sure there's stuff I'm not thinking of that's open to you, but really 
you're best off leveling up and then doing the nicer quests that become 
available to you at the higher levels.
