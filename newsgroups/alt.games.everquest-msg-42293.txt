I know a suggestion like this may not help when you're in withdrawl
mode, but consider the following. You've been using that computer in the
configuration you had since the last time you upgraded and EQ ran fine.
Then, when you'd made no changes to anything, your city blows up and
suddenly you have problems. Nothing you do to your system fixes the
problem.
  I'm guessing it's outside your box. I shudder to think that Sony will
be responsible for answering your question, because if it's something
like packet loss, trouble with log-in, etc. their default answer, tought
to them in training, is: "Sorry. The problem's on your ISP's end. Give
them a call. Thanks for playing."
