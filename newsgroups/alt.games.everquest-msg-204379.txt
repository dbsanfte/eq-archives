He thinks that because many of us feel that KEI at low levels is 
overpowered that it also means that we believe that any mana regen spells 
are not useful as anything but a crutch.  Personally I am always happy to 
get a level appropriate mana regen or multiple mana regen spells cast on 
me.  I still regen my mana with canni/heal even then, means I can 
accomplish more in less time.  Oh, and if he is to be believed, he quite 
EQ over the KEI change, but he still trolls here for some reason, guess 
he gets his jollies out of people pointing out what a clueless idiot he 
is.
