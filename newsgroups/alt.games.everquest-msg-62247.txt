Considering in most groups there's maybe 2 to 3 meleers, increasing
one person's damage output by 35% is more effective than increasing
one person's mana regen by 1 to 2 mana/tick.

100% haste is available in game right now.  Dragon haste + Shissar
caps you at 100% haste.  The *HIGHEST* mana regen item in the game
right now is FT 5 item off Tunare.  That gives you 5 mana/tick.
Unless your cleric is regenning mana at 5 mana/tick, there's no such
thing as a 100% mana regen increase item.

*IF* VI was stupid enough to put in a mana regen item that doubled
your regen, then yes you can state that such an item would
significantly impact your efficiency.  But right now, given that 5
mana/tick is the very best you can do after killing Tunare (assuming
she even loads it), there's no way FT is gonna be anything more than
"ooh...aah" items for those who don't go past that initial Effect:
label.

Where are you gonna pull the 12 or so clerics you'll need to make that
encounter trivial?  Do you think you can just whip up 12 level 45+
clerics on the fly?

Even back when our clerics had the pre-nerf BP, we didn't bother using
it since:

1.  It wasn't neccessary.
2.  It required MORE clerics to do the same job due to the twice as
long casting time (which then went to 3 times as long casting time).

Generally, if it came down that all our clerics were OOM and the mob
was still alive, it's time to get one of them camped out rather than
trying to start up a heal chain with the BPs.

I don't know what BoTS did before hitting ToVN, but almost every
single guild I know farmed ST key dragons first, went into ST, farmed
sufficient number of primal weapons and THEN and only then hit ToVN.
Let me re-phrase, then and only then did they have SUCCESS in ToVN.
