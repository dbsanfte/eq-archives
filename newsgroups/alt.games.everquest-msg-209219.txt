Ok, I have 2 duos that I'm looking for assistance finding a hunting ground
with.

One is 56 bard and 56 druid, other is 39 and 40 necros.  Necros are
currently in DL (yawn) even though exp is great, I brought the bard up there
and to me, the drolvargs are no longer "ravishing".  As far as the bard and
druid go, I have absolutely no idea where we can go with them.  We've tried
the planes, and even though the exp is good I've found them pretty boring.
Most of the mobs seem to just have a shitload of hp's and hit for a lot.
I've only been in PoI, PoJ, PoD, and PoN but it seems to me there was a bit
of lack of imagination in these zones.  However we still go there, hehe.
Basically just looking for maybe a couple worthwhile off-the-beaten-path
type of suggestions.

TIA,
BF.
