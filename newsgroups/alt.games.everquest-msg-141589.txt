Im pretty sure he doesn't flurry (or rampage) but its been that long, im not
entirely sure.

Did Kunark even have flurry/rampage mobs?   off the top of my head I can't
think of any

Im not trying to say hes a pushover, sure he hits real damn hard, but its
not explosive enough damage that a tank will simply drop in a second flat.
Assuming the tank is getting heals (or even if he didn't), LoH is a faster
cast time than the time it would take him to reduce the MA's HP to zero

Rune + me controling a cleric (being able to see my HP as they drop down, at
what rate they are falling etc) was enough to stay alive for a "decent"
amount of time.  We still wiped, so ultimately the raid/i didnt have what it
took at the time - but even in the 2? minutes that I tanked him, that would
have been 120 opportunities for a Paladin to LoH me before i died.

Any self respecting warrior wouldnt drop too fast for even LoH to land (imo
anyway)
