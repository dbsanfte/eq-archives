so you prefer a world that is really just a lot of unconnected zones
with not alot of depth.  that is eq.  soak rinse and dry soak rinse
and dry, just in a different zones as you level.  and the whole point
is the leveling.  most of the spells are just new versions of older
spells, or because of the way spells are handled in EQ, you get 1
spell that mergers multiple lower level spells.  

But in the end what EQ has always lacked is depth of soul.  DAOC had
mrore of that from the start.  not enough, but it had a depth about
it, when marching around ALbion, or midguard or hibernia you feel like
your in a realm.  you may be a wilder region, or an area in the
control of heretics but the various regions are part of a larger one.
There has been an effort to make a world, not just a bunch of almost
unconnected zones.  

EQ has more items,  but it lacks in depth of content.  and just having
lots of items dropping does not real content make.  

and even there DAOC has to improve.  but its the next step along the
path that will lead to the online games of tommorow.  

and it gets rid of alot of those areas that confuse tedious with hard.

Daoc is not perfect.  its PVE is comparable to EQ, and it adds in RVR
for when your bored, or if you prefer it.  RvR can be fun, i was taxi
cabbing some high levels way up on the frontier and we ran into some
hibs, i died quickly and watched them,  it was like Boromir, with
bodies all around them before they finally went down for the count.
alot of fun.
