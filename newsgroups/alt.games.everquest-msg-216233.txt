There was a time (about a month?) before PoP was released where the
new iCH spells were in the game, the level limit was still 60 and many
people were doing kindergarden camps like FG shrooms or velks. Even
before the iCH was put in game, lvl 60s didn't need clerics to heal in
those camps. Adding iCH just made it a lot worse for clerics. ... but
that didn't last long, as soon as PoP was released the clerics made it
back to the top of the LFG pecking order. 

I don't see LDoN changing that either. Pickup groups will always
prefer clerics imo. Even in LDoN, rezzing is still a lot more
convenient than having to wait outside the dungeon for a corpse to
pop. Plus, druids have always had a public relations problem, you can
be reasonably sure that any random cleric will know how to heal but
can't really make that assumption with a druid. Some just don't like
healing, some have soloed their way to 60 and haven't really learned
how to group well, some are loners who wouldn't ever group if LDoN
didn't force them to for the new phat loot. If a cleric is a screwup,
at least he can rez you afterwards <g>. I'm very hesitant to pick a
random druid as main healer for my group even though I have no qualms
about having a druid I know do it. 

Rgds, Frank
