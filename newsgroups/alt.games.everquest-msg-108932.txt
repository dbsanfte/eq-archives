Ug.   I honestly don't know which I consider worse though, the druid doing
nothing but nuking, or the druid whining about not getting enough experience
on a raid. Really one of my pet peeves.  Don't whine about experience or
splitting kills when you're on a raid.  You are not there for experience, but
to accomplish a specific purpose.  Groups are set up the way they are set up
so that the chances are best that the raid will succeed and as few people will
die as possible.   Nobody is trying to screw you out of experience by hogging
all the rogues or whatever.

Ack!   Really sorry to hear that.   Can hurt a lot, especially when those
blues come so slowly.     I don't think I've had an unrezzable death at a raid
yet... but I had a non raid one in 59.   Ouch.

My own summoning story has a bit of a happier ending.  It began the same way,
a white wurm ended up gating on us...  I was the first person that was
summoned.  Uh oh... /shout Everyone camp now! Everyone camp now!.
/discipline defensive.

The amazing thing though was that even with no heals... it just couldn't seem
to manage to kill me.   It had summoned me with a good portion of my life
remaining... and I just stood there and fought it for what seemed like a full
minute or two.   People were logging *back* in by the time I died, and I was
the only corpse that had to be fetched.
