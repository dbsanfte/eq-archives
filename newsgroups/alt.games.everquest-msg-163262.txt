Hey, no fair!!

But you're still disqualified if you've had a KEI *ever*.
If you made it to level 65 without KEI, then had it
*once*, you're not in the running. Also doesn't count if it's
a character you've retired or don't play much.

Basically, you need to have been tempted, and not
given in. :-)

KEI was only introduced a few months ago, right?
I remember going to the Nexus when there were no
KEI merchants pushing their wares. :-) But I've
only been playing since May or so...
