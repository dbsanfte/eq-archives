If you're on a raid right before your mom's funeral, maybe you have other 
issues to deal with.  If you want to be able to save your game and quit 
whenever you want, EQ isn't the game for you.  Or you need friends.

How is it impossible?  You have the Nexes Spires now, and there aren't 
many raid zones that a 40+ character can't get to, even naked.  Of course 
there are times when a corpse is deep in <nasty dungeon> and the only sane 
choise is a summons, so you suck it up and buy a coffin.  

Corpse runs are a fact of life, and provide a bit of a break from the 
mindless grinding.  Do I like 'em?  Not usually, but I look at them as 
just another skill to be mastered.  (Yesterday's example:  Died due to 
bugged Von under the world in WW.  Immediately petitioned about bugged 
Von, memmed songs and ran from Bazaar to Nexes.  Ported to GD, started 
running, Guide responds to petition, explain situation as I run.  Guide 
and I hit WW at same time, he verifies Von is bugged, but no CS rez.  I 
drag to epic cleric who is setting up at zone, total time 15 minutes.  I 
are CR oober!)
I like the death penalty in EQ, it provides incentive to NOT die, and 
think about what you're attacking.  It also slows down leveling, 
especially at the end game, and if you don't like the death penalty, don't 
die.  (I'm sorry, but at levels where it's an issue, you should be able to 
either not die or find a rez.)
