Thank you for your reasonable response.

I agree that my initial response was a little agitated, and in truth Emperor

or for that matter drop great stuff.
 I guess I just saw it in the light of higher level and longer pulls/camps
that I am used to and not being used to having people jump on
something that I obviously have snagged.
