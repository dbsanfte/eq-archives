If not, just go to http://www.ign.com and get a 30-day trial code.  It only
unlocks the original continents (pre-Kunark) but at least you can use it for
muling.  Of course it runs out, but just get another "throw-away" e-mail
addy and apply for another code and you will be sent another.  I've run the
last 4 months that way.

Funny thing is, I've used other account like twice, hehe.

Good luck,
SEAN...
