Ok we have Resists:

Magic
Fire
Cold
Poison
Disease

now, I do not pretend to know anything about this, but someone had
told me that lets say you were hit with a Disease DoT.

first resist would be checked against Magic... if magic failed then it
would go on to the next until pass or fail on Disease..
so that means for every resist attempt you have 2 chances...

so, what's the truth?  do you always get a check against Magic and
then another if it applies to the type of spell?  It sorta makes
sense, because all spells are magic, but it also does not make sense
because your getting a double chance to get out of it.


as usual, your time is appreciate.
