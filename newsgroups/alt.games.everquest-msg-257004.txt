I wasnt speaking of ranged-only-fights.What I meant is,
when using Archery I never took any damage,while the
melees always take damage,maintank or not,1 second
of not paying attention by the rogue in a hard Ldon,and
he nearly needs a complete heal,so draining mana from
the Healers.

There is some use for Damage shields and Regrowth,none
of the Holy Trinity of Enc,Cle,War get this spell lines.

Well,there is an advantage,I can make 1 AA in 90 minutes solo
in HoH or make some pocket money while lfg,while the poor
warrior sits on his butt while lfg.

I take your "bottom of the barrel" comment as being related
to dps.Are you sure this is true for a Ranger equipped with
a Darkglint blade and a Time spinner?

I think our differences come from playing different
games,you be the raider,me only doing Ldon,sometimes
GoD,and very rarely raiding in PoP.
