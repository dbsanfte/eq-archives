Just bought a new computer, an HP using Windows XP.  Everquest runs 
wonderfully on it, except for a really annoying white "mouse arrow" in the 
exact center of the screen.  Never saw that when running the game on my old 
PC.  Would anyone know how to get rid of the damn thing?  It's really 
distracting.
