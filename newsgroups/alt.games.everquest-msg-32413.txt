Before CHeal, there's not a lot of reason to wait that long.
The benefits of the group being at or near full health will
outweigh the benefit the tank gets from going into a frenzy.
Consider an add 3/4 of the way into the fight:  if you've kept
the tank "topped off", the group will likely finish off the first
mob and be well-established on the add before you *have* to
cast a heal.    If you've let the tank go into a frenzy, now his
health is going to plummet rapidly, forcing you into a heal
possibly before agro is established on the add with all that
implies or, worse yet, you might not be able to get the heal
off in time.

After CHeal, of course, then the longer you wait the more
efficient your heal will be.   At that point, it becomes much
more of a balancing game:   Is there a possibility of an add?
How long can you wait and still have a safety margin for a
fizzle or an unexpected run of rounds which cause the tank's
health to drop faster than you expect?   Does the group
have crowd control in place (chanter, bard, etc.?)  And so on.

Anyway, IMO:   the risk/reward before CHeal isn't worth it.
After CHeal, the risk/reward is more towards waiting but
due to the mana efficiency of CHeal rather than the extra
damage the frenzy causes.

From just personal preference, I don't like the tank being
"normally" below full health.  He just doesn't have the safety
margin that I like.   I *know* I'll gain agro from a heal unless
someone already has the mobs attention, and I like having
the luxury of waiting as long as possible if needed.  If the
tank has to be healed NOW, a lot of your options are gone.
The more options I have available to me, the better.

That said, the only experience I've had with a tank who wanted
to be constantly in a frenzy or near to it was interesting.  He
was consistently doing more damage faster, and the group
was taking down mobs faster than it would otherwise.   That
was at a lower-level, though, where haste items and STR/DEX
buffs aren't as common or as effective.
