Mostly because it only works on animals.

And the level 44 charm spell is royally broken, I can't use it to charm a
green tigeraptor in WL, but my level 34 charm spell works fine, working as
intended, riiight...

I look forward to being able to scribe Call of Karana in another level very
much.

As for pulse-pounding fun, try zoning into the Grey fully buffed, and invis,
only to have 5 skellys sitting there, and one see invis, train them out into
the middle of the zone and start gate, and as gate goes off, SEE THEM
RUNNING OVER YOU! (whee max channeling), or the same thing with 3 shimmering
rockfiends that like to camp the zone line, or just about any grey train
fixing tactic (since stuff will camp the zone line nearly indefinitely if
trained there)
