Ok... but then VI is going to have to up the limit on /ignore. There are 
WAY too many beggars out there to /ignore ALL of them. Yes I've received 
and passed out buffs. THAT is not the issue. The issue is ASKING for 
things that you did not rightly EARN... or for that matter make the 
least ATTEMPT to earn it. And I seriously doubt anyone of that type of 
character will return the favor. As my fiance would say, "What color is 
the sky in YOUR world?".

Yup, there IS a beg button. I sorely wish the little bastards would use 
that and beg from the NPC's. I would LOVE to see the pile of corpses 
littered around every vendor and guard.
