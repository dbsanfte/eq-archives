forget level 10, make it level 1, any class/race (or just gnomes)!  Make
sure to throw in check points along the way to check for cheaters!!!
Have it set up so prizes can go to main characters.

For prizes 500pp would make me the happiest but I would still do it for
100pp.  Problem with giving armor is what if I'm a mage?  Could always give
choices for some good low level stuff, winners choose.

I participated in one a few months back, lvl 1 gnomes running drunk from
Ak'anon to HighPass Hold getting drunk again at Freeport docks.  We were all
PvP as well quite funny but I think the sponsors got a little tired of our
antics (30 gnomes that can't shut up).

Whatever you do, post here especially if you are on the Tribunal!!
