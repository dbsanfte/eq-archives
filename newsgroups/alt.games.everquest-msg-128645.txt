why is it up to israel to decide the fate of the palestinians? seems to me
the palestinians are fighting for basic human rights which israel has
continuously denied them for 3 generations now. you think they should all
just shut up and allow themselves to be beaten into submission? to accept
life as israel chooses for them without question? even if the life israel
chooses for them is death in the form of sharon's personal genocide
against them?

fuck that. maybe the palestinians learned from israel's mistake of going
passively to their own slaughter in WWII. if i were anybody at all in that
situation i would surely fight too.
