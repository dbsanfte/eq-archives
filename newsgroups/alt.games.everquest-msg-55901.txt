My wizard was able to do this at about level 29 or 30.  The thing is, the
crocs will attack if you move into agro range, but will not otherwise help
each other.  So you just stand (and med when necessary) on the lowest step,
right at the water's edge.  When the time comes, pick one and pull it to
you.  Just try to stay on that lowest step so you don't get the adds.  Not
having a pet using class, I don't know if pets will cause a monster to agro
simply because their master would -- I'd assume not.  On the subject of the
Ancient Croc, I barely gated out with my life at that level, but the croc
was very low on health too.  Being a better solo class than wizards, I'm
thinking a 30 Necro may pull it off, depending on the pet you have.
