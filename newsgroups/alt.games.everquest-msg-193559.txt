Your messages aren't quoting correctly, so I'm not going to respond after
this.  Too much work to fix it.

Actually I believe it's 900 mana, which is almost a third of thier mana bar.
Several minutes of sitting on your ass time.  15 mana coming back every 6
seconds doesn't make it all that much shorter.

At 30 mana, by level 15, you can barely tell you cast SoW.


> Damn that invite button click is worth...50pp for sure :P

You miss the point.   The spell is coded so that you have to "cheat" to get
it on a character lower than 45.  It's too powerful for normal use, and the
game creators acknowledge it.

Mana costs time, and as they say, time is money.

>  so are you saying that the other players should have to pay for the
enchanters spells?

Once again, you miss the point.   SoW spell costs about 5 pp and is
available from an NPC vendor.  The wizard spells that you mention in a
second can be purchased from an NPC vendor, and will total around 150 or so
plat.   KEI is not available in a store.  You can only get it from high
level raid encounters, mobs hard enough that they take 4 - 6 groups of
"average equipped" level 60's.

If an enchanter had to buy the KEI scroll, they had to get it off a player /
guild who did not need it.  Those spell scrolls sell for an obscene amount
of platinum in the bazaar.   I haven't played in a while, but while it's
possible that the prices have come down somewhat...  I still don't think
you'll find many enchanters who bought it that paid less than 30,000 pp for
thier spell.

If you still don't see the difference...  why we're not considering the cost
of a 4pp spell, but are considering the cost of a 30,000 pp spell.. well,
let me know.  I'll stop wasting my time.


>  Damn, I spent all that play on my wizzies spells...why dont people give
him money

people for it).

Yeah....  uh huh...  come back when you actually reach those levels, rather
than telling us how nice you're going to be to every idiot that demands you
run over and port them.

(and damn right this applies to a wizard porting people as well.  I've never
bought a KEI, but I've shelled out several thousands of pp over the last few
years in ports and translocates.)

It doesn't need to be nerfed, it needs to be fixed.   The spell is not
unreasonable at 50 plus, when 15 mana per tick is a small amount.  All they
need to do is to fix the code preventing high level spells from affecting
low level players, by removing the group spells exception.  Move the level
check to the point where the spell is going to go into effect on the player,
rather than checking it only against the target and only when the player
casts it.
