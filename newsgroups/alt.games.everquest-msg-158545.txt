Sadly, the second part of that is important.

Disease seems a bit more trainproof than the other zones, save Justice.  The
graveyard / zone is a bit of a climb above the main hunting area.  And the
first set of mobs seem widely spaced apart, and not very trainy.

The graveyard in Nightmare is somewhat nasty for this...   the zone out is
in the little house right next to the graveyard.   So anytime someone zones
out, whatever was chasing them is inside the house out of sight, but within
aggro range of everyone in the graveyard, including the naked and newly
rezed.  Since it's original target is gone, it usually tends to whack a few
people before leaving.

Justice graveyard is safe, partly because the exit is nowhere near it, and
also because there is nothing near zone in that is KoS.    You have to go
past the exit to get to KoS mobs.

Innovation is the mother of all train zones.   The graveyard here is a
deathtrap, with 10 to 20 mob trains arriving regularly.   The layout of this
zone is very odd.  You can only go two ways from the zone in.  Both ways are
very long "tunnels" that have mobs every few feet and a fast respawn.
Groups moving into the zone end up having to leapfrog each other.   This can
cause a very bad situation if any one of the groups overpulls.   They are
overrun, as is the group fighting behind them... then a domino effect as
each group fighting thier way through tunnel respawns is hit with the same
train, all the way to zone.

Thats not even counting the inexplicable things some idiots do.   Just
tonight we were way way deep in the zone... clearing one of those little
side rooms.  The next thing you know, 10 mobs appear out of nowhere behind
us.  At least 10 was how many AE taunt hit when I tried to give the druid
time to use instant evac. Not even instant evac was fast enough, and it took
roughly three seconds for the entire group to die.    As our enchanter was
in her overhead view of "Loading... Please Wait." she got a very nice view
of the monk Feign Death'ed right in the center of our corpses.

At the same time, down the other tunnel, (not sure how far down it) another
group from our guild was fighting.   A rogue runs up, runs past them and
aggros three mobs.  The rogue keeps going and rounds the corner ahead...
the next thing you know, the rogue comes tearing back around the corner,
with about 10 mobs in tow.   The rogue's comment as that group was waiting
for thier corpses to appear in the graveyard was reported to be "Escape
doesn't seem to work in Innovation."   I still for the life of me can't
figure out what the fuck he thought he was doing....  where he thought he
was going to get to, and have time to hide and escape...  which I'm told
doesn't even work if one of the mobs can see invis.  Or what he thought he
was going to do when he got there.

I'd sort of have to second that.   Maybe you can hunt the rats in the halls
of Plane of Justice.  They were light blue at 60.

All of the new planes seem to have insane exp modifiers on each kill, but
it's completely compensated by how hard everything is.   Very little (if
anything) hits for less than 300 a pop... and fast, if you don't slow them.
And all seem to have a decent amount of hit points at least.   The spiders
we were hunting for experience were worth about a half blue of AA per kill,
but they hit for 508 damage, and proc'ed a stun / feign death that was
particularly nasty.   Non-named red con mobs were meleeing for 676 points a
hit....

And the traps... ouch.   Let me tell you, having 4 "blue" spiders spawn at
once is not my idea of a fun time...  especially if all four can harm touch
for 891 damage, and hit for 330....  (I think I managed to turn halfway
around and get out "What the fu..." before I died, the first time I saw
them.)

Well, I see I've wandered somewhat off target... but it was a nice rant, so
I'll just leave it as a thread shift ; )
