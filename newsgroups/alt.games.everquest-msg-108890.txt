What about a greedy Ogre Shadow Knight who worships Cazik Thule going on a
Plane of Hate raid?  And even if he does assist in killing Cazik Thule
himself?  Killing his own god?  But is it OK because followers of Cazik
Thule enjoy pain and suffering of others also?  And if Cazik Thule enjoys
pain and suffering, then wouldn't killing him be considered doing something
to him that he enjoys, and therefore not be wrong by anyone, even his own
followers?
