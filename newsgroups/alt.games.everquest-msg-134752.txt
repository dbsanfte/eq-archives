Well, 4 tries on that item -would- blow double my current cash on hand.  I 
can understand extree frustration in those circumstances.  It'd be equal 
to my cash on hand, if I hadn't spent half of it making a GM Jeweler's 
eyeglass... :)  We aren't all rich enough to take such a loss with perfect 
grace.
