In our guild there would be no question - the perpetrator would be
out.  He obviously did intend to deceive (hence his exclamation in
the guild channel).

I really don't think you can call your guild "one of the good ones"
if they let this person remain a member, and don't even think he's 
done anything wrong.

I saw the same bullshit on a recent post on the rogue boards where
someone asked for a TL from a necro and the necro cast sacrifice on
him.  "Oh, it's his fault for not reading the box."  Bullshit - final
responsibility comes back to the person who intended to wreck the 
gameplay of someone else.
