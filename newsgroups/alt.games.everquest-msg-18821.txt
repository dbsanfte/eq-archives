Hey Joe,
    If you're out there, I've been having a problem with the log
parser.  It seems that Verant changed the level gaining message from
"You raise a level! Welcome to..."  to "You have gained a level! Welcome
to ..."  Now I just Dl'ed the latest version but I already went through
and changed my log to work.  But, I also lost a level and it doesn't
record that I did.  In the log I have 2 exact copies of the sentence
"You raise a level! Welcome to level 6!" and yet the parser doesn't
recognize that I lost that level.  If you want a copy of the log, I'll
email it to you.
