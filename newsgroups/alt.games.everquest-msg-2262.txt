As with anything in your inventory, you can hold the right mouse item on
anything being sold by a vendor to inspect it. The same holds true with
the trade window. If someone tells you they're selling you an Enameled
Black Chestplate, and you inspect it and find that it's a FP Chestplate,
then you know you should pipe up. As far as buying clothes in other
places, most often you will find sizes that are inline with the local
population. There are alot of people, however, who will sell things to
vendors, so the possibility of finding something that fits you is pretty
high, no matter where you are. Just make sure that you always
Right-Click on the items you buy to make sure you can equip them.
Clothing, as well as armor and weapons, will tell you exactly what race
and class can equip each item.
