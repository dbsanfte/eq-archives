Hey I agree with you on how great a ranger is ...heck that is why I play
him...but at 51 on Bertox. It is nearly imposable to get into a group. It is
imposable to get into an ubber raiding guild. I have nearly left EQ and have
posted in the past about what to do when you get this high. I have several
friends who are part time player and I too am a PTP but I am sick and tired
of running to <insert zone here> and sitting at the zone line shouting LFG
for hours on end only to have my play time shortened or to be known as
(don't let that guy in our group he does not get to stay long.)

I read about how great other servers are and how it is never an issue with
other ranger but if I switch servers I loose my friends, my loot and my
respect only to have to start out as a newbie. Hence I am looking at an alt
that can solo effectively and is fun to play I have considered a Mage but
that can be expensive to play. Necros just do not appeal to me. Sorry for
the long post but I felt I should explain my state of thought.
