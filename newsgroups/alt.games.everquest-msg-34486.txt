Yesterday in WC there was a level 12 character constantly using /ooc to beg for
buffs, heals, sows, etc..  Kept hounding my little lvl 14 druid, and I saw her
hounding other people too.  The first 3 or 4 times I fell for it.  Used most of
my mana to cure her poison and heal her to 3/4 health... sowed her.. buffed her
- etc....
Twice she inspected me.  I blew that off as a newbie thing since all I have is
leather and some cheap jewelry.  
Last straw:  she's pestering me for buffs.. I have one bubble of health and no
mana left.  She inspects me - AGAIN.  
I get up and inspect her. 
Imagine my shock to find she has incredibly expensive armour and weaponry. 
Not ONCE did she offer a donation for my time and trouble..  the nerve of some
low life slime.  AND she's in a guild.  Really, shouldn't guilds disapprove of
this kind of activity?
In my mind this is every bit as bad as begging for money, because in fact, for
a level 14 druid mana IS how you EARN money killing critters.  Am I right????
