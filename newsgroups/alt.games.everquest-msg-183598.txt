I know full well what nerf took place.

That reminds me of something actually... DT, you say you don't need to be a
65 monk to know everything about them- what got nerfed ("fixed") for monks,
after our mitigation nerf?  It never made any patch messages..  do you know?
Im assuming of course you don't (you're not a monk, why would you?)

>     Perhaps you're too uber to comment on the pre-50 game or something ;)

Shrug.. I've just leveled a rogue up through those levels

Tanks better: sure
*AVOIDS* more?  Nope, sorry.

My point is simple.. whats more effective?
Slow+Mitigation
Slow+Avoidance?

And I'd say the latter

Shrug sometimes a mob needs to be tashed and OOS'd first... maybe
Malo+Malosini, can't slow it before those are in place, and you're waiting
on other people anyway

SK's never fit into my exp groups..  Im all about maximum DPS...  charmed
chanter pets, monks, rogues and the like

I can tank good enough for my groups that a) we don't  die.... b) theres no
down time and we can chain pull
So sure, a comparable SK does tank better than me.. but I already tank "good
enough" whilst doing considerably more damage.  Win win situation for me
