   That's sweet of you.  But really, I'd rather that you play whatever
you want to on that account.  Any class, well played, can be a welcome
addition to any group that I am in.  Don't let my enchanter envy sway
you.

   Ok... Lance wrote the above, but I'll respond to it here anyways. 
While it is true that Lenny doesn't often come to this newsgroup, he had
now autojoined the age chat channel.  Is this enough to make him an
official AGEr?

   Well, I personally doubt that there are enough AGEr's to support a
guild.  If we do all end up in the same guild, I am certain that we will
need some local talent to flesh out the ranks.  The thing is though,
that I at least have very high standards for any guild I join.  I want
to be with others who play their classes very well, and are honorable
and concerned with keeping an excellent reputation.  

   I haven't heard of NVA before.  And I don't want to sound harsh or
insulting, but I would not be interested in joining any guild that
doesn't have a fairly strict screening process.  I mean, I'm sure you're
a fine, upstanding person...  but how did NVA know that?  Did they group
with you a few times to see if you really know what you are doing? 
Check the FV community board to make sure you aren't a know scammer?  
Know anything about you except that you were willing to click yes to a
guild invite pop up?  You take chances being in a guild like that.  You
get one idiot wearing the NVA tag who thinks its fun to train other
players and then you are going to be guilty by association to a small
degree for wearing the same tag yourself.
