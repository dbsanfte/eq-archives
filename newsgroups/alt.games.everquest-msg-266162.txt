As much as I'll hate to I'll probably wait until a later server pops up 
for my main characters.  Avoiding the power levelers and (cough sorry 
Bob)the batch of beta's who are running around in uber armor while I'm 
still trying to figure out how to walk straight. :)  I still have EQ 
memories such as being lost in Kithcor on one of the paths (this was 
about 3 days after release), it getting dark, and in a panic, scared that 
something would pounce on me, asking another character in the zone (she 
turned out to be a beta), which path to take to WC, she told me to never 
take the paths, just go south, and run around the zone wall, nothing 
would hurt me.   It kind of ruined the 'being there' feeling of 
uncertainty, fear, etc. Obviously that comes eventually, but I want 
things to last a bit longer.
