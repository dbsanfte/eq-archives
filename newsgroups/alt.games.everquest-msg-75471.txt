When I zoned into Dalnirs yesterday, there was a GM there.  I asked if they 
were there to look at the LD / Desktop crash problems and they were.  I 
gave them several /locs where it has been happening.

Turns out that a -lot- of people are having this problem in Dalnirs and 
nowhere else.  Glad to see they are looking at it.

Our party jumped down to level 2 and there was the remains of a TPW.  We 
Rezzed them, and cleared a swath to the zone to get them out.  They were 
quite happy.
