    About halfway down the first page you'll see what titles were found in
the eqgame.exe file, and a few "confirmed" titles that folks have earned. It
scares me that some people have already earned *18* alternate XP points or
more - that's three per day since the first day of SoL, based on the post
date of the posts in that thread. I have to admit, "Exarch Delores Mulva"
has a nice ring to it. Heck, I'll be happy to see "Baroness Delores Mulva"!
