Hey all,

I am new at Everquest and am playing a human warrior. She is about lvl 5
now. Her deity is Rallos Zek. I am finding that when I wander a bit too far
and go into certain areas I get greased by the guards. Most notably a
dwarven city (don't remember the name) and a halfling town. Before I even
know what's going on the guards have pounded me into a little pile of goo.
If I was to restart a new character is there a deity that is a little more
liked? Or once I get a little higher level will the guards leave me alone?
It's kind of a pain dying do easily!

Thanks for your help!
