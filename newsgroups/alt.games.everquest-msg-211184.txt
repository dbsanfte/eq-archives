Devine is dead, no idea if he was an EQ developer in addition to his acting
carreer, but I doubt he had anything to do with this.

I did see a DE necro just today sporting this look.  I have the Old World model
on for DE males, if that helps.  No idea why this was happening to him, my six
year old said one of his characters had the same thing happen and claimed it
was due to a necklace I'd given his character... but he's not a highly reliable
source of information.
