not bad at all

> Skill in 1HS is 90

i guessed you were 18 because your skill cap would be 90 . .

getting 2hs up seems hard, right? NOPE - getting it to 200 from 7 is hard,
and annoying . .. getting 7-100 is only half bad

people have screwed themselves on important skills much worse, don't worry


> With 1HS my ATK # is near 400, it drops to 180 with my 2HS enabled.

at your level, that isn't even as bad as it sounds . . in groups, when
things are going well, just say you're going to work on your 2hs a little
(switch back when in trouble, its np)

YES- you guessed correctly . . soon as you ding 20, you will shed the
largest dmg cap and be able to hit for plenty more

honestly, you *should* try to keep both skills up . . . every pally has
their own impression of either 1hs (or 1hb) or 2hs being better for damage;
you just keep working the skills and keep open minded until 2hs skill rises
a bunch more

also, the damage you can do with any non-range weapon is based on (1)your
skill, (2) your strength, (3)your offense skill, and (4) your level  . . .
breaking 10 and 20 allow you more damage, then every few levels you gain a
damage bonus point

 bash seems like good damage, but after 20 you're only going to want bash so
you can interrupt casting monsters

(and you will want that . . . there's ruatha bashing which you might try
[someone post the link please?] if you're fancy)

really, its up to you - hehe but if you want my opinion, i would say 2hs for
pally/SK - its your best change for damage since you don't have dual wield,
plus there are some stun spells that can make up for not bothering with
switching to your shield right quick


and btw, if you gain lots of skill in 2hs before dinging 20, you will still
not be able to hit for more than 32 dmg
