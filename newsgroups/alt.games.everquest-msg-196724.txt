That makes sense, but when has the shaman class ever been intended to be 
as good a tank as a ranger or monk? I don't know if it's their damage 
mitigation tables, AC effectiveness or what, they aren't cut out for it 
and you don't see them used as tanks in favor of the melee classes. I'm 
not saying it can't be done, you've proven that it can. I'm just saying 
it ain't natural. :)

Yes, you will always be able to find those. That's not an intentional 
alteration of game dynamics, however.

Granted. I should point out that a person of your experience and skill 
twinking the hell out of a character is a *lot* different than someone 
deciding to start a character of which they have no knowledge and 
throwing 100kpp at it. All you're doing is discouraging people from 
playing warriors. :)  The inexperienced people are avoiding learning 
their class until far too late.

Again, let me say that my primary point was that I just find the idea of 
a shaman being the better tank over a ranger or monk somehow wrong, 
making the contributing circumstances questionable. To each their own.
