No ideas yet. The one I got identifies as a Greater Symbol of 
Rolfron Zek. The kejekans don't talk about it, though I haven't 
checked since the last patch. If they fixed the Shaman in
Kejek then she might give a clue about it now.

Could also be that, like the ball of yarn quest, that it involves
the Warrens in some way.

If you find any clues, let us know! =)
