The question is not absurd.  The amount of ridiculous clicking or

I would like to hear from players who play bards on this matter.

I doubt they will say the clicking/keying they have to constantly
do to twist songs is a good feature and they play a bard *because*
it requires lots of clicking/keying.

In fact I mostly hear them talking about wrist pain.  I'm amazed
you consider injuring your customers a good feature of EverQuest.

I asked an honest, genuine question based on sheer curiosity.  You
responded like an ass, which is predictable.  You were better for a
while, but lately you've gone back to asshole mode.  What's up?

Since I've never played a bard, I'm not sure how you've determined
I'm whining.  Oh, right: It's just you being an insulting asshole
again.

: Well, if pointing out that you had managed to come as close as humanly
: possible to asking a stupid question makes me an ass, then so be it.

The question wasn't stupid; however, your responses so far, have
been stupid.  Giving your customers physical injuries is a good
feature of the game, indeed.  You moron.

: Wrong.  It's a requirement.  You may think it's stupid, your opinion
: does not make it so.

It's a stupid requirement, and you haven't justified it.  I don't
think you can.  Your only talent seems to be responding like a
condescending ass to anyone who asks a legitimate question.

: It's similar to that yes.  Amazingly enough, as I pointed out above,
: the designers didn't choose to make everything the same.

In this case, they should.  People complain (regularly) about
actual physical pain from playing a bard.  That's not a good
thing, that's a bad thing, regardless of your attempts to make
it sound like a good thing without providing any actual reasonable
justifications.

: Wrong again, I am doing me best to show you your obtuseness.

No, you just did your normal, predictable, act-like-an-asshole-when-
someone-asks-a-legtimate-question routine.  I can only imagine
your wife isn't giving you any and you're frustrated.  Go take the
attitude elsewhere.  It was old before, and it's old now.

I'm perfectly capable of being open minded and listening to
reasoned arguments.  You've had none.

If you want a point-by-point example of where you acted like an ass,
let me know, and I'll copy & paste the relevant sections to you.

Twisting songs is fine.  I've never argued against that.  Don't make
shit up, Kaev, it only makes you more the ass.

: I do so love irony!  That gift alone made your post most entertaining!
: Oh, and one more thing:
: Bite me.

You know, Kaev, I'd quit flaming you if you'd stop responding to my
legitimate, honest questions with insulting responses.  Grow up.
