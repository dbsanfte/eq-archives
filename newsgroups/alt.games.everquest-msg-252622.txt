It's relevant because in order for a fraud to occur, the court needs to find
that the platinum has value, and that is not simply determined by the fact
that someone would pay money for it.  You have to show that the platinum is
not nominal consideration, and considering that the party that actually is
in control of it, SOE, has said that it holds no real value, it'd be
difficult to do.

No, I've written a bad check, and that's something entirely different.

But let's change your bad example to something more applicable.  Let's say
you and I agree that you give me a worthless pebble from the street and in
exchange for it, I'll give you $1000, which I will pay for with a check.  I
then immediately call my bank and have them cancel that check.   You'd think
I'd committed fraud (actually, contract breach, but who the hell cares about
terms), but you'd be wrong, because the pebble is nominal consideration, in
other words, worthless.  It's not a substantive transaction, and no American
court would enforce our agreement.  You have to show that I was getting
something worth approximately $1000, and you can't show that with that
pebble.  And you can't claim that it's worth $1000 because I was willing to
pay that much, because quite obviously, I wasn't.

Now, as for this particular situation, I suppose the plaintiff could bring
forth the fact that rampant platinum sales have demonstrated a very real
consistent value for the platinum  (even if it may flucuate at times), which
I think is approximately 1/1000 of a US dollar per platinum piece, but I
suspect that that would all be rendered moot when SOE gets involved and says
that they assert all ownership of all the items in EQ, that they ultimately
control it and can destroy it without anyone else's permission, and that
this is expressly stated in the EULA that each user agrees to upon login,
and that they assert that it has no value.  The plaintiff would have to
overcome that hurdle before he could claim he was defrauded.
