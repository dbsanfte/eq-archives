Many circles end with this phrase.

May the circle be open,
But not broken,
May the love of the Gods,
Be always in our hearts,
So Merry Meet and Merry Part,
And Merry Meet again.

It is kind of tradition, so if you don't like it dont say it.
Many witches and pagans use this term when meeting and greeting kindard
spirits.
