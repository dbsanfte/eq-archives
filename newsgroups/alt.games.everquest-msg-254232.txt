Yep. Lol.

Worst part is its an -annoying- bug. It will complile just fine, and 
when it fails it will toss a stupid message like " 'xxx/yy.zzz' could 
not be opened.", where the natural course of error checking is to verify 
that xxx exists, that it contains yy.zzz, that all the permissions are 
set correctly, etc etc... while all along not seeing the obvious problem 
that you simply used the wrong slash.

I recently worked on a web project where I had done -just that-, and put 
a couple slashes the wrong way in an SSI directive in some shtml 
templates, and it even worked fine on the test server (windows), but it 
broke on the deployment server (linux) which was more particular about 
URL formatting. One of those bugs that's hard to see even when you are 
staring right at it, unless you specifically look for it.
