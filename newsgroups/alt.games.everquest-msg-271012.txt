Well... last time something somewhat similar (not the quite the same.. I 
called, was told they had it, asked them to hold the item for me, and 
they didn't put a copy behind the counter because they didn't think it 
would sell out) happened at Circuit City, the manager hunted down the 
item 3 states away and had it FedEx'd to me overnight at their cost.

Plus, while the manager wouldn't say anything about it, one of the guys 
at the service desk said it was sold to an employee's buddy. Even 
pointed out the employee to the manager. (long drawn out bit of 
conversation there... I don't want to go into it really.)
