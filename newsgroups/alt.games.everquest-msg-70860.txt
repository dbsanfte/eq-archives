You have to spend points on the general abilities first, so there's
still going to be some decision on what to spend them on.  The WIS
enhancement is as good as anything else at that level, assuming
you're not in gear that makes it meaningless.

The argument that you should consider leveling first is another
matter, of course, and that argument has little to do with the new
alternative XP system.   It's almost always better to level than to
build stats, period.   And I can't think of a single case where it's
not.   Leveling means killing mobs which means loot which equates
to items to help build stats so why channel some of it away, until
you're 60?   For me, at least, it's because my toon started out in
a stat hole and I'm simply not in a guild capable of getting me
good enough items to make it irrelevant.   Being 55 with 10 more
WIS than I have now and faster mana regen is going to make more
of a difference to me than being 56 would, so I've begun channeling
10% towards it at 51 and will channel 20% through the next levels
until I get enough points to get the mana regen, at which point I'll
go back to straight XP.
