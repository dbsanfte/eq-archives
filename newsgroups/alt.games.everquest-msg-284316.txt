Where are these recruits coming from?  If the answer is "guilds lower
on the flagging totem pole", then you have created your own problem.
The solution of course is to build a team of players, who progress
through the content.  Yes, you will pick up occastional strays, and you
will lose a small percentage to sniping.  But, if you build a team that
chooses not to snipe other guilds, you will build loyalty, and with the
85% principle, and the various backflagging provisions, there will be
minimal need for backflagging.  OTOH, if you let yourself get stuck in
a rut of backflagging every single applicant then you'll never progress
into, and certainly not through Elementals.  The encounters required to
access Elementals and Time, RZ, Sol Ro, X and RC certainly can be
zerged.  However, they can also be beaten with a tight finely tuned
team that is loyal to itself and its members.  I do not look forward to
the next expansion for that very reason, because the new level cap will
quite likely break some elements of those encounters, either for those
at the level cap, or for those attempting to challenge them at the
intended level of gear, skill, and level.

Once in time, you enter a playground of loot that in some cases is
still best of breed.  Time gear will allow you to progress through GoD
and pick up additional gear as again, some GoD gear is still best of
breed.  CoA can apparently be skipped in favor of DoN and DoD
progression, although some choose to pass through CoA first.

And of course for the unguilded or occasional player there are open
raiding teams, semi-closed raid teams, open raids and other progression
opportunities.
