Hmm... Really? How odd... I get pestered for ports less, certainly, which
I'm grateful for, but even accounting for the massive inflation of late,
I get offered ridiculous amounts for ports when I am asked for them.

> 2) Many spells indoor only so useles in LDoN

Druids have been hunting and even soloing in indoor zones since before
launch. How is LDoN any worse?

Personally, I almost never find myself wanting for an outdoor-only spell
in LDoN.

> 3) Soloing devalued with the new bonuses for grouping

<sarcasm>Yeah they really screwed soloers, didn't they? Made it much
harder, huh?</sarcasm>

Bit of free advice: EQ Proper, Kunark, most of Velious, and much of Luclin
are empty these days between PoP and LDoN. Pick a solo spot and knock
yourself out.

> 4) Not valued as main healers by parties in most cases

Oh? Every adv I've been on without a cleric I've been main healer. At most
you need an enchanter or bard and you'll be perfectly fine. No such group
I've been in has had any trepidation about going in with me as MH.

I usually read "healer", "dps", and "M" as "get your ass over here,
Druid!". Seems to work fairly well.

I don't want more support, I've got plenty, thank you. More just makes me
look like a weak whiner.

Huh? Poor spell level?? Pack regen, pack SoW, pack Shrew, SLD & PSLD,
Firestrike, Remove Curse, and Shield of Spikes are "poor" ?! I danced a
freakin' jig when I hit 39 after the horror of 34, and we didn't even
have Shrew or PSLD then!

Perfectly happy with LDoN and the current state of Druids.
