Well if the ladder is on the near side of a hole you walk up to it, turn
180 so its behind you, step back very slowly and be prepared to step
forward as soon as you begin to fall if the ladder isn't angled enough
to catch you.  Then point your perspective down and move forward.  If
the ladder is on the far side of a hole its easier,  you can just run or
jump forward accross the hole and should land on the ladder.

If you ever want to perfect these skills make an Iksar SK, their guild
building is full of ladders and just getting to the trainer to turn in
your note is a great lesson in EQ physics <g>.
