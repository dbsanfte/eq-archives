Normally I would agree with you if time wasn't such a limiting factor. On a
good day I am able to get about the posts scanned (with only selected
threads read) - and increasingly I can't stop to read at all for days, even
weeks.

Killfiles then become a very useful tool - a filter cct if you will, to
shunt some of the useless noise to earth. That gives you more time to spend
of legitimate signal.

Cheers
