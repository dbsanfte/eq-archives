That is why it is callled eating a death. You simply bind outside 
the zoneline, for PC in the bank by the cleric/pally guild, grab 
a cloudy potion from the bank, go zone in, chug the invis potion 
and walk back to your body and loot it. Nobody gets disturbed, 
nobody gets trained, and 2 or 3 mobs later you have made up the 
points you lost. Honestly, my cleric mostly soloed PC to 24. It 
was inordinately fun, I worked a wacky swing shift and played in 
european time, and PC was significantly less full of asshats at 
0200-0500 east coast time=)
