Ok, I'll keep this short.  I'm a lvl23 Barb Shaman and last night I
won an Earring Of Cleansing that someone was giving away to the
highest roller.  The stats are nice and the clickable effect is great,
but from what I understand, it's not usable until lvl50, a loooong
ways off for me.

My question is, if you were in my shoes would you hold on to this item
to use later on or sell it now and use the pp to buy some nice
equipment to use now?  I can't decide.  Help!!!!!
