Login has been down for an hour,  and Verant finally said they are working
on it,  no ETA at the botoom of a locked post.  In the mean time  they have
deleted about 12 posts asking whats up. (that were posted before Auric's
msg.)  Thats that great Verant customer service,   love the game , hate the
staff.
