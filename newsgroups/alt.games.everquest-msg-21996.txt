Oh my god, the last 3 words are the most important.

DO NOT WHINE.  Do not joke about how many times you've died...99% of the
time it's masked whining and you're not fooling anyone.

YOU ARE GOING TO LOSE EXPERIENCE ON A RAID unless you're lucky enough to be
in Team KS.

YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET ANY LOOT unless you have been to the planes a
number of times and have earned it.  Oh, sure, lots of guilds /random for
loot, but first you have to hope something drops.  IF it does you have to
hope you roll the highest.  If you're in a guild that doesn't random (more
of those than the former) you'll have to wait your turn.

You go there to say you've been there (yeah, I know, most 50+ people would
not be impressed).  You go there to do something new.  A rite of passage.

Whiners need not apply.
