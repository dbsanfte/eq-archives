I don't give that line if all they are asking for is advice, I am happy
to assist in whatever way i can.  Only thing I might have phrased
different but doubt it would have made a difference to the person you
asked is.  Instead of:

Could y'offer an ol gnome a few words of advice?"

I might have said "I seem to be having some difficulting in locating the
proper vendor for spell X, could y' help an ol gnome loacte 'em please" 
Still somewhat in character but less likely to set off the give me stuff
bell.  I would have still helped you, as I have never heard someone take
a solicitation for advice into begging for stuff, but I can see the word
Offer make some feel you were begging.  It pays to read thoroughly.  And
you would be suprised at what "advice" you can receive.  I asked a
magician that was in Freeport around level 14 at the time which pet i
should buy after hitting level 4 as I could only afford one and wanted
to get best for my pp.  They said where are you, gave me enough money
for all of them and said all of the pets have their uses, here.
