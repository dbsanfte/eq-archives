  While searching, I saw two people selling a
jagged diamond dagger.  First person had it for
sale for 7500.  Person below him had one for sale
for 500.

  Not entirely sure which number is correct for
a 9/22 +9DEX rogue piercer, but needless to say I
jumped at the second one.  I feel somewhat bad if the
person mistyped or forgot a zero...but hey, if I can take
the time to carefully enter my sell prices, they should too.
You snooze, you lose.
