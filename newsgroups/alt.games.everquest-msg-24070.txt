Virtually any David Gemmel books - what is nice about most of them, is that
they are virtually all self-contained stories...but they hint at each other,
and link in histories without giving too much away. He is also not afraid to
kill of main characters - thus avoiding the nice, safe endings you normally
end up with in a lot of writers books. Very refreshing.

I'd concur with the Raymond E. Feist books. A most excellent series.

David Eddings ain't bad either, but after a while everything seems to melt
into one - and all the characters become a little overbearing with their
"intelligent" conversation. The earlier books in his series' are best.

The Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman "Death Gate" series are also
excellent...highly recommended for the interesting twist on the fantasy
world they created.

Just me 2pence...
