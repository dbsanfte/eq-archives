Abstaining from meat on Fridays doesn't seem to
get a mention in the Bible at all.

I remember reading that it was brought in by
church authorities in the Middle Ages, as a way of
getting their flock to patronise the significant
Catholic interests in the fishing industry.

I have heard some pagans claim that it stems from
the worship of Dagon, an ancient fish-god.
