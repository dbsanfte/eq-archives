You should be on Innoruuk.  We have evolved beyond punt the gnome, and are 
playing Gnomeball.  There are two different versions, but basically make two 
teams of level 9 nekkid characters (no bards), start with the coin toss (random) 
with the winner given the opportunity to kill the gnome (Futbol).  Once the 
gnome is dead, they /consent all players, and the idea is to drag the corpse to 
the goal.  One version is PVP, the other isn't.  Both are supposed to be rather 
fun for all, except the gnome.
