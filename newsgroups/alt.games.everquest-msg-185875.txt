I created a new bard on AB last week called Squire, specifically for
the purpose of grouping with some friends.  When I return to AB today
(these days I usually play on Test), I discover that suddenly Squire
has become Smire!  Now, I can't see any way that Squire violates the
EULA, and even if it did, I'm pissed off that it's been changed behind
my back rather than a GM contacting me in game.  They haven't even
changed it to something that a sane person would keep as a character
name.

Has this ever happened to anyone else?

(I've petitioned it via EQLive, but I'm not holding my breath.)
