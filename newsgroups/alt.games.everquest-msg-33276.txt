<snip question about alligator skin>

Alligator skin is the bottleneck for the quest.  My rogue has 11
alligator skins sitting in the bank, many from killing a billion alligators
and a few bought from newbie trolls.  The Dirk is easy, there
is a fella in the game that drops one every time he spawns.

The quest isn't broken, it's just hard to get the alligator skin.

Weapon doesn't matter.  Usually kill the gators in one backstab
before checking to loot, and always use piercing in both hands.
Either I get a skin or not, weapons don't matter.
