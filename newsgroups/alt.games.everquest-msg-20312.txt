Yes and no.  They can't rely *only* on a log, but a log
can certainly go a long way towards lending credence to your
story, and also providing leads for the GM's to follow up on.

A log can provide the sorts of details that can help the GM's
better grasp exactly what happened, and/or provide clues as
to what needs to be researched.

Can a log be faked?  Sure, but then so can your original verbal
story.  It's more work to fake a log (and harder to do it
undetectably) than it is to just lie about what happened.
A log isn't automatically more trustworthy than a verbal report,
but it gives more to go on.  Plus, I suspect the GM's have
tools that can, in most cases, either verify a log's veracity
or refute it.

Think of it as a photograph entered into evidence in a RL trial.
It might have been faked, but if so a sharp investigator can
detect the fakery.  And if it's not faked, it really helps
clarify details about the case.

If nothing else, the log can often be used to show the
petitioner why he was mistaken, or was not so much
entirely in the right as he had originally thought.

In short, a log isn't "proof", but it can certainly help.

If I were a GM, I'd much rather have a story AND a log
to go on, instead of just a story.


>Use /report

Always good advice.
