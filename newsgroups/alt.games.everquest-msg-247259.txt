While I agree with you that the freeze-ups are more annoying and
important to get fixed, the eye of zomm thing is probably a single
setting change requested by a lot of people -> very easy and takes
very little time.

Tracking down random freeze-ups is most likely a lot more involved,
especially if there is no reliable way to trigger the problem.

Debugging problems that can't consistently be reproduced is VERY
difficult. And yes I'm a programmer.
