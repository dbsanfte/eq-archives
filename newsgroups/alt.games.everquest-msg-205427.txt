this is the time limit most ppl give for waiting for a song to set in,
however Ive found that by shortening it to /pause 26 or even 25 it
allows me alot more time to work fast in case the unexpected happens
and I need to break in w/new song; like if I need to pulse the 49
Selo's to get my grp's asses hauled outta KC due to to many Hands
popping in the room or even mez'n some of them.  Ive found no real
neg-effects and I can keep 4 songs running w/o a prob normally.

also, its good if ya do hafta keep 2 mobs mez'd while keeping the
party hasted and healed, since U can tap the macro once and let it
play out, the hit mez for mob1 & again for mob2, then hit the macro
again.  the macro saves alot on the ole wear -n- tear on the fingers
and hands (some days used to be just painful for me.....I'd just let
haste run at times so I could rub my hands), all I ask is just dont
ask me any questions while Im doing this since Im not THAT fast a
typist(U'd be surprised how many 50+ players have no clue about
this.....LOL!!)

also, since Amp lasts about 45 secs, I wouldnt bother adding it onto
the macro.  U can twist Amp w/2 macros fairly well if ya get the
timing down right.

(tip: twist Amp with the 32 mana song when ya get it, just pulse Amp
once and let mana run for 4 pulses.....casters & hybrids will like ya
for it!)
