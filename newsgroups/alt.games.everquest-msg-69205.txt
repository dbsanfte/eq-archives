I was a hardcore Windows 98SE user. When Luclin was released, I didn't
buy it or a new processor, using 450mhz AMD, but I was a good little
boy and upgraded to DX8.1, bought, err charged, a GeF2 MX400 64. Kinda
like putting gold rims and spoiler on a 81 Chevette, but still.
Already had plenty of ram (650megs) and was ready to roll.

Everquest ran like Bruce Jenner the day after a visectomy. Was
sluggish, crashed to desktop often, sometimes wouldn't load at all.
Raids and XP groups were out of the question, nothing like a cleric
with a flakey system. I was in mage/druid solo land. Died a few times
due to crashes. Then couple days ago  I got the dreaded  "No 3D Device
Found".  Reinstall DX8.1 for the eleventeenth time, resinstall
Detonator drivers (again).  No luck, no 3D Device. EQ wouldn't even
load. Wouldn't even get to the EULA screen.

In a blind fit of frustration, I upgraded 98SE to XP Professional, and
redid Detonator to XP version. And have been kicking myself for not
doing it sooner!  Its *SO* much more stable. EQ runs like a feared
snow griffon! Particles on high (mage AE spells still kill frames with
particles on but thats no biggie at all), clip plane out so far I can
see the back of my head, can levitate in the rain without massive
framedrop (woot!). Sound isn't "warbly" anymore. All good. So good I
got my buddy to play on my system while I was sleeping just to see if
it would crash. Never did. Its just like old times. /cheer

Wonder is sony is getting a kickback from VI ?
