Hello,

I went into  Befallen today to go and see if I could go and kill that Lrodd
and to my surprize and demise the place was packed with NPC necros. What is
up with that? What are they doing in there? There was no more crappy
skellies just nasty lvl 9 - 12 necros. They all grouped on me and I died. I
went back to get my body and there was a 31 druid there who helped me get my
body back. Does anyone know what is wrong wiht the Befallen?

-Dylan-
