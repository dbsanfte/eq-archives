Only monks can wear cured silk.  You can wear raw silk, though, and it's relatively
cheap.  My enchanter is a tailor and sells raw silk armor for 5gp per AC.   Some
tailors may charge by the number of silk swatches it takes, or even some percentage
above their cost.  (others might just give it away if they are rich!).  Raw silk is
1 or 2 AC above cloth for each piece.

Go into some play like Gfay, or EC and /auction WTB raw silk armor.  PST
Tailors of skill about 30 can make it fairly reliably, and they love to make it
because the supplies are easier to get than the only other thing they can make in
that skill range (bags).

After silk, I don't know.  My enchanter's only level 13.  He's gotten several
nice gifts along the way - a robe of discord, and a crystal shadow robe (I think
that's what it's called).  So I'm set in the robe department for a long while!  The
rest of the pieces are another story - all raw silk.

I'm hoping I will be able to afford  something better in my late 20's or eary 30's.
My wife's wizard is a smith, and eventually she'll be able to make elven chainmail,
which can be worn by casters, surprisingly.  It'll be a while though, as getting skill
ups to that point will be very expensive.
