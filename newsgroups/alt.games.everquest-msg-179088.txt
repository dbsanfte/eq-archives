Excellent suggestions.  I have a few more to add (based mainly on my gear,
which was mostly cheap from Karana's bazaar
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=470731 and some slots that
James didn't mention):

Coterie General Cape (AC 8, STR 5, INT 4, HP 40).  Drops off the generals in
the castle in TM.  Shouldn't be too difficult for your group to break into
and snag a couple.  They're EXTREMELY common drops.  My guild has camped
Valdanov for a few members, and EVERYBODY in the raid comes away with at
least one.  If you can't get 'em with your group, they're common enough they
go cheap in bazaar.

Drachnid Thyxl (AC 5, INT 5, Mana 40, Ext. Range 2).  Should give a little
more mana in the range slot, and  more AC is never bad ;)  Drops off a named
spider (Dread Widow) in DL, upper 40s in lvl I think.  I got mine from a
nice druid who solo'd her, so it shouldn't be a problem for you guys.  Just
flush the spider webs, she should pop quickly.

Incandescent Mask (AC 3, CHA 7, INT 5, Summoning Haste 2).  Temple of Sol.
Ro quest.  Should be soloable at your lvl.  Might need some help getting the
mark from Mistmoore.  Costs something like 15pp to run the quest.

HTH,

Mystarr
