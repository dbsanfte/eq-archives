Yeah, freaking drove me nuts trying to figure out where the hell the howling
was coming from.  My bazaar mule's monitor was turned off but those speakers
are near my main computer's speakers.  I think I was in juggs/reets at the
time and knew there wasn't supposed to be any wolves around there. :p

Sorta like the damned horses and blacksmithing noises in POK but no horses
or blacksmithes around.
