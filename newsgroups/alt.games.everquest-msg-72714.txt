  Maybe because it's the way it's supposed to be (though I don't see
the point, if they're not going to aggro they might as well be
'dubious' to everyone and keep everything consistent) or maybe because
it's a minor bug that doesn't really bother anybody.  Though it also
seems like this is something that'd be easier to fix.

  I've also noticed that a few spiders (crag spiders, most
specifically, if I recall correctly) also scowl (or maybe glare) but
don't attack unless provoked (or unless another spider is attacked).
