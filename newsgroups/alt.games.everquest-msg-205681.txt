I see it on Morel Thule in bazaar and in POK both.  If the casino operator keeps
his spam down to every 5 minutes or so I usually don't bother with ignore,
there's plenty of other spam out there.  Higher frequency may get the ignore
list, but its not as though I'm ever likely to group with them, as they are
almost always disposable mules.
