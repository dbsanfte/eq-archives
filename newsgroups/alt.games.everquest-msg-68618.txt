> You have chosen not to upgrade your system.

  Again... even among people who meet the system requirements to play
EverQuest, some are still unable to access the game, or play without
severely gameplay hindering issues.

  Though it's true that I personally have "chosen" not to upgrade my
system, I was given absolutely no advance warning that an upgrade
would be necessary.  Some of us don't have the cash to run out and buy
$90 worth of upgrades just to play a game on such short notice,
especially this time of the year.  So our "choice" in the matter has
been rather diminished.
