Once you're maxed with dwarves that should be enough to be dubious to
dragons.  However, there's nothing stopping your 34 wiz from going to Kael
and tagging along for faction reasons.  I assume you have the required
debuff staff, so just tag giants that others are fighting.  Try to avoid the
see-invis areas if you're also working on dwarf faction (no dwarf faction
there).
