I'm not sure, but I wouldn't go near the SK\Necro guild while there, if I
were you. The ghouls outside it will aggro on anyone who isn't a DE, and the
guards WILL join in if you try running.

My Human Necro, who I deleted a long time ago, found that out the hard way.

Invisibility to Undead *might* work, but I don't know if you could actually
train there or not.....
