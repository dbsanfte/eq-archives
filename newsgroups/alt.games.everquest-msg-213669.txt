Thus far my mage is a distant third, with my shaman (to 52) and bard (to 57)
both outperforming mage (only at 30 so far)

Mage's have no way of single pulling, no root, no mez; in other words, they are
limited to pulling mobs that are -easy- to get single, or to dealing with
multiples.  While I can kill yellows and low reds at 30, doing so eats mana in
a very serious way... and I have no easy way to get mana back.  Oh, and I can
only heal my pet, not myself, and have no slow, only a pet only haste.

My shaman, on the other hand, had root, slow, heals, cannabalization, and could
happily melee or root/rot solo.  By 30 he didn't have his pet yet but could
charm if he needed the help, he didn't do that much because it was easier just
to kill everything.  At 34 any hope of comparison to what my mage is going thru
vanished utterly, shaman with dogdog is a very potent combination indeed, and I
don't recall having anything that resembled trouble soloing from there to 51.

Bard soloing does get spotty in a few places, basically you have to tread water
till hitting first charm, and then there's another spot in your 30s where the
first charm is pretty wimpy but the second one isn't there yet.  Once you get a
full boat of DOT songs, though, there's little you can't kill, and with  the
second charm there's even less you can't kill.  Swarm kiting, once mastered, is
by far the fastest exp generating engine I've seen any solo class come up with,
defeating quad kiting wizard and druid play hands down.

I'd have to concede shaman are better soloers than bards 1 to 28 (or whatever
level it is where the first charm song happens) and certainly more steady, but
I haven't taken either class to 65 so I can't say what happens up in the
stratospheric levels.

And its entirely possible that mage soloing gets better somewhere in the 30s
for reasons I am not currently aware of, I really haven't researched the class
much to see whats available in the future.

I -will- say that mage's spend about 10 minutes summoning a full set of gear,
pet, gear for pet, med to full, buff pet, med to full, before being ready to
go.  If you have to log out with any frequency, or even if you like to move
from one zone to another, the class really is probably the worst one in the
game.  I have a shaman friend who I summoned a full set of gear for, she plays
a couple hours and then kills herself (by duel if possible) so as to retain the
gear.  I guess that would be the way to go for the mage, too, but finding
someone to duel me to death every time I want to log out is a pain, and at 30
the almost 2 blue of exp lost for a real death is almost as annoying as the 10
minutes spent starting over from scratch.

Mages do seem to shine in a group, as with most DPS classes, they aren't really
built all that well for soloing IMO; the exception being the Beastlord, which
is pretty much a shaman with lesser versions of the spells and a lot better
melee output (and a better pet, available from level 9!)
