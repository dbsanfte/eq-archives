D&Ding, for my group of friends, was always more lent towards role
playing and generally goofing around than fighting with dice and
stuff. There were a countless number of situations where the only way
out of a problem was the most ridiculous idea possible.

One thing that comes to mind, is a ridiculously huge maze that a
friend came up with when he was the DM. He had it all completely
mapped out on several (4-5) pages of graph paper. Of course, the rogue
made it all the way through completely unscathed (it's nice to be
neutral-evil with a high sense of traps and hidden passageways. Fun to
buddyfuck your partymembers without them even knowing it was you ;) .

DM: "You see a giant boulder -- fucking Indiana Jones style -- coming
straight towards you down the narrow path. You notice the rogue is
nowhere to be seen."

Players: "Oh, fu -- *SPLAT*".

I remember another time, when I was DMing, I would usually pick out
two or three of the best players and assign them characters that are
grafted to the story. They'd be stronger than the other player-made
characters, of course, only because I told the two to three basically
the entire story, what their characters know, and what their goals
are. They had complete free reign after that. A paladin I assigned to
one of my friends had a 20 charisma, instead of the standard 18 max,
simply because not only was the paladin the most beautiful human on
the planet, but her breasts were perfect in size, shape, and form, so
they each got 1 extra point ;)

I really wish there were some D&D groups up here in Indiana. At least,
some that I'm aware of. To be more specific, AD&D (2nd edition). I can
remember the long weekends, the 72 hour gaming sessions where by the
first few hours, the entire environment was beginning to wither and
die from the sheer flatulence influenced by Dr. Pepper and pizza.
That's the only thing I miss about California, there are a shitload of
roleplaying groups in the bay area.
