*gulp*

Right now, with the Kentigern toon anyway, I (along with whomever I'm
grouping with) am killing beasties in the four digits (I think).  I hadn't
really thought about it, so the (future) numbers are rather staggering.

However, as you said Mikey, it takes as long as it takes.  I am in EQ for
the fun and the trip and the camaraderie.  There isn't any "finish line" in
this game.  And hey, the XP is just a side bonus.
:-)

Oh, and Tim?  Math huuuuurts.
