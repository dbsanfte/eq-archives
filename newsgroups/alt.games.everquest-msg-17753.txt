Busker,

You've got me curious now, have you managed to use the TBoots during
combat?  By that, I'm mean casting while you're currently being pounded by
a NPC, not casting after a successful evade/hide.  I know there's numerous
ways around losing TBoots at an awkward time, but I'm curious about my
Channeling skill theory.
