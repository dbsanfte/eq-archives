The armor drops are quite rare and quite a few people will want them, so you'll
have a great deal of competition for them generally.  I wouldn't put any effort
into getting gems until you have a piece of armor you need gems for.

Its possible to get armor drops in KD at the WL line, but extremely rare, odds
of a drop seem to go up the higher the level of the mob, but never get
particularly good; where you generally see armor drops  is on a raid into the
arena area, with a good number of people killing dozens and dozens of mobs
you'll expect to see three or four drops a night... split up among the 30 people
you brought along to help.

I've heard that there is a "plate cycle" where mobs that drop plate more often
are spawned repeatedly, never tried it though.

The COV armor is significantly harder to do, the mobs that drop it are on a
difficulty level comperable to Vox or Nafalgen, but drop nothing much other than
perhaps one armor item every six or eight mobs... you need a raid that can kill
dozens of these in an evening for the project to be interesting.  At the higher
end of the game, this can be a single group project, but by that point you'll
likely have moved on to higher level spots.

Another funny thing is, the armors are generally not all that good really.  The
AC is nice, but for a cleric, the honest truth is that AC stops mattering after
a while, as you aren't on the plate defense table, and end up getting hit almost
as hard as casters in their cloth underwear.  The stats tend to be remarkably
silly, a point of this a point of that.  The clicky effects, likewise, are
generally sad things, summon water from the boots, the breastplate has mark of
Karn, an almost useless effect (it does remove targets DS).  One good piece is
the legs, which have a clicky 105point group heal; slow, but free, very useful
into the lower 50s, and if you buy a pony, still useful even at 64 (on the pony,
you are medding while you chain click, spilling out around 600 mana per person
per minute at no cost)
