Yep - that means kunark is basically uncontested. Thats a lot of evil
players busy powerleveling right now without even having to watch their
backs - apart from self team training idiots of course (doesn't all teams
have those?).

If these players get bored and turn their attentions to Antonica then the
scales could be seriously tipped. Though I don't see that happening anytime
soon though, Kunark is basically "PvP-lite" and you don't get much PvP
experience at all. Sort of like a high level Ebayer ~ all the gear but no
idea...

I actually heard one Iksar Warrior moaning after a duel that the Shaman he
fought "cheated" in using SoW...

*coughs*

Of course there will be those who already had PvP experience before sullon
opened and chose Ikkies, now those definately are at an advantage.
