I think the point would be that you shouldn't be able to expect to make 
that long of a trip that quickly. Just because a friend could use you in 
their group in that distant land, doesn't mean you necessarily should be 
able to just pop over there. "Back in the day" you would hunt more within 
your current region out of necessity, or risk venturing out.

It wasn't about inconvenience. It was about atmosphere.
