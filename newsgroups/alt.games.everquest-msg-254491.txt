 i have been looking at the window and martin's post a good deal and have it
readily available:

http://tinyurl.com/4jxva

now... if i can just add my own two cents, in the hopes of mitigating the
aggravation of looking for more specific descriptions:

i don't have the target rings turned on because they look silly to me -- 
whether they are on or off, the MA's target's name appears inside arrows (if
the leader has delegated an MA)

NPC health displays the health for any mob targetted, so it's slightly
useless because the target's HP is in the target window, but to each his own

HoTT is best for one thing, i find -- checking who is jacking the
aggro......my warrior has need for this so he can adjust better, though in
fact, unless you are a kiter-for-life, you should get this next (though
lance, i know you can't save up the points yet until you've leveled more)

it does quite rock

and after that, inspect buffs, in my mind, was only good because it gave the
remaining duration of buffs, something i have been waiting for (like
numerical mana displays) since day 1 ....... however, with the new UI
feature, inspect buffs is really only good for inspecting other people's
buffs, and is thereby most likely quite lame

any other opinions i have are in accord with things that have already been
said, but to synthesize them quickly: yes, hp enhancement is a lot of points
for the return, but every little bit helps, and what else are you going to
spend your points on?

and i would rank the remaining abilities like this, based on what i've seen
since i started paying attention:
(you have delegate MA and will get HoTT when possible)
hp enhancement
atk enhancement
health regen (not even worth it)
mana (double ditto, you should have turned LXP off by now)....and so on
