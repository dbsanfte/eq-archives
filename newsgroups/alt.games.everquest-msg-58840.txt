I agree, lots of useful info there, however there's on thing that's
missing (or I haven't found it, at least): Recommendations for
specialication. Anyone have any suggestions what a necro should
specialize in? I told my friend to go with Alteration, however it
would seem to me that it's pretty much a tossup between Alt and Conj.
This just from reading the spell list, btw, I have no idea if Alt or
Conj gets used more often...

BTW, I think Castersrealm is up again, although they are having
bandwidth problems or something, though.
