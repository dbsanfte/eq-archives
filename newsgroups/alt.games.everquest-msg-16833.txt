Drunk?
Player_00 auctions: 'WTC celium Etched Spone Mace, Crafted Brycer,
SSB, rEND TELLS!'

Grouped with a rogue and others, I am casting dizzying wind for stun
value and conjuration raises.
Rogue tells the group, 'Looking at that rhinos hiney and seeing an
intense gust of wind message was not what I was expecting'

Cleric tells the group, 'We had a guildie soloing, went out for a
smoke, and came back almost dead. I told him, 'Smoking kills''

Warrior tells the group, 'I feel one with the universe.. I am around a
ranger,,, and two druids. don't convert me'

I once asked a rogue friend of mine what he was up to and he replied
he was doing what he does best. Auctioning? I ask. No, he's pimping
female wood elf druids, and he knows lots and lots of them.

Dorf_cleric shouts, 'Any Barbarian lasses wanna marry a hansom dwarf?'
You shout, 'admit you just want to look up their kilts'

While playing my dark elf (wearing leather pants):
Player_01 shouts, 'anyone else seeing a shit ton of blue?'
You say out of character, 'you better not be staring at my blue
butt...'
Player_02 says out of character, 'only a man would make that remark'
Player_03 says out of character, 'Yeah.. a woman would then have asked
'Does blue make my butt look big?''

I figure, she's a dark elf. She looks good in anything except maybe
plate leggings, and definitely not fat :)
