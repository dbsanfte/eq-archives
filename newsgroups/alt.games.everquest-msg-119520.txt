Yes, keys are only good once and you are expected to buy your own CDs
to get one.  However, Sony recently (in the last 3 or 4 days) sent
free keys to subscribers for their friends to use to try EQ. I suggest
you have your friend check her email and see if she got one; if so,
you can use that. Please note: it's only a 30 day trial; after that
they expect you to start paying. Also, they give you a license to use
your friend's software for 30 days as well; but the wording was kind
of sketchy, I thought. It read to me as though they might expect you
to go out and buy your own CDs in a month, if you wanted to keep
playing. Not sure about that though.
