I don't recall the name, but there's one in SoV where you have to kill
several mobs to get to their leader, and then kill the leader and loot
a quest item.  People have reported that if they try to skip those
other mobs and kill and loot the leader, they get nothing.  Only if
you have killed all the mobs by the time you try to loot the leader
will you get the item.
