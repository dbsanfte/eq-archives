    Low level rogues have a tough time getting groups, because that coin is
what allows new players to grow their character and people are rightfully
paranoid about losing it. At high levels rogues get picked up ASAP for
groups because they give the group higher XP/unit time, and that is much
more valuable than the coin loot. The stuff with high value, the magic item
drops, cannot be picked.
