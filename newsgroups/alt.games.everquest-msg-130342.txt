    When my level 40 monk went down recently to get a piece for his Shackle
of Steel, I paid a visit to the lumpy goo area just to see what it was like.
At least at level 40, there are non-aggro nibblers in that area. Now, if the
person who was there last hadn't left two coerced gnomes (both mages) within
damage shield range of all the mobs in the corner it would have been doable,
too....
