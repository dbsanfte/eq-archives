Ah, sorry, I missed the post where you said she was being REALISTIC.  Yeah,
REALISTICALLY you'll probably want a minimum of 512 and a P3 1000 (or AMD)
or better with a 64MB card.

Supposedly you could play the original with a P133 & 16MB RAM I think.  Good
luck in Unrest or around that one corner in Freeport with anything less than
a P3-450 and 64MB RAM. :p

With RAM being sooooo cheap right now ($25 for 256MB) it's a great time for
folks to upgrade anyway.
