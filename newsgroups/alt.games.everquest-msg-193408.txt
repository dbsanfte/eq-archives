Now, how many of those people who bought the game are still playing
it? Many people only play a new game they buy for a month heavily at
most, then either trail off severely or stop all together. Also note
that the numbers currently playing were AT THAT MOMENT. How often are
there 400+K people on EQ all at once? It was a milestone for them to
hit 100K, less than 1/4 of their subscriber totals. Consider also that
the majority of that total number playing are either Diablo2 or WC3
players. (A big chunk of the remainder being Starcraft) Note as well
that the majority of the sales for most games comes within the first
couple months of release, so I doubt their total sales now are that
much larger.

Now, consider all those other online gaming services (Gamespy, etc)
and the number of players on those. Then those who play direct IP
games without going through a 3rd party matching service. Sorry,
you've proven exactly jack shit.
