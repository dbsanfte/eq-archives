looking for direction in vendor diving for items...

Im in EK tring to collect spider silks.  I kill a spider and sell the silk
to the vendor.  I then reclick the vendor to see if it comes up for sale.
nothing.  I then start purchasing a number of items.  My concern is if I
resell those items to the vendor, do they go to the "bottom" of the pile?
Or, do they get grouped up with their respective items.

this is what I was doing:  I buy 2 backpacks of rusty 1h axe.(only space I
have open)  Rather than selling back to vendor, I drop them on the ground.
I continue to buy the axe until vendor runs out and "slot" opens.  I reclick
the vendor only to find some other item that I have to clear.

My question is more on the first set of backpacks.  Should I have resold to
the vendor?  I was afraid that by doing that, it would only "group" up with
those axes again.  In effect, I would be doing a loop of buying / selling
axes..all at a great loss.

I finally got the silks I needed...but at a cost of about 80pp from
purchasing spider legs, cloth armor, etc.  rather than re-sell to vendor, I
just dropped on the floor.

I was tired of all the clicking that I left the stuff there to rott.  :(

basically, almost 4 full stacks of spider silks cost me 80pp+.  I will need
spiderling silks also...so, I m getting freaked out how much building my
tailoring is gonna cost me.

suggestions in vendor diving greatly appreciated.
thanks
