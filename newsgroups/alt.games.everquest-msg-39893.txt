A couple of questions about the Silent Watch Shield quest. Firstly, I have
been told that Anti-mage faction should be high (apparently to get bracer
from Tearon). Now I know that my faction with them isn't great but I have
the bracer, but do I need good faction for anything else?

Secondly, what faction do I need to have with the Royal Fish (and what
faction is it on)? I have kindly faction with Clerics of Tunare which is
what I understand it to be, but confirmation would be nice.

Thirdly, where is the fish? Sure, I can probably hire a Ranger/Druid to
track it but nice to know where the general area is anyway. Have been told
near the Aviak docks?

Fourthly, does the shield allow you to bash even when worn on the back?

Thanks very much,
