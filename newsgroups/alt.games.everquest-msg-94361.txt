So what you are saying is that since there is a "possiblity" for abuse
everyone who plays is subject to an unearned death so to speak. Lame
very lame but prob true.
Now the question is ..so what if its abused by a small percentage of
players? How does that justify killing off good players?
Dont see much difference in abusing this and level 50+ char farming HG
in Rath, just part of the game.
