If there were ever such a thing as a 7/1 weapon, it would be godlike. You'd be
soloing named dragons.
The kodiak claws have a pretty crappy ratio, though you could certainly sell or
give them away in a newbie zone to make somebody just starting out very happy.
Much nicer were the claws that drop off of icetooth.  I won the roll on those
this week when we were camping kodiaks and managed to get him to spawn.  First
time in a while that I actually decided to start using a weapon I looted.  I
think they were 11/29 or something to that effect. Not too shabby. We also got
several of the capes, but they are also newbe fodder.... AC 3 and some minor
resist stats as I recall.
