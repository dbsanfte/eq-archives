No, just stupidly tedious.
Velious recipes do not trivial even after you've gotten past 220 skill
(infact, most don't trivial even after 250).

Have you ANY idea how ridiculously huge of a tink sink it is to get
tailoring (and specifically tailoring) up into the 200's?

You can't just brute force sit on your ass chatting and raise
tailoring.  Every stinking recipe in the game requires a mob dropped
component.  And to get to the 200+ range, it requires ridiculously
rare components and mob drops.

Compare this to smithing where you can just throw money at it and
raise it to 200+.  Or jewelcraft, again a huge money sink but you can
at least BUY everything you need to raise your skill.

Trust me, raising tailoring stops becoming fun after velium silks
trivial.
