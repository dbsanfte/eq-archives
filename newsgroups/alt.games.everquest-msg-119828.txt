Thanks for all the advice. I decided to just suck it up and stick with
him. With FD becoming more and more reliable now, he's starting to
become quite the soloist. Grouped with an ikky monk last night and we
were kicking butt. Went from 22 to 26 over the weekend.

He still doesn't seem to have enough staying power though. Any ideas
for decent STA gear? He's a moderate twink (cured silk head to toe,
but dual CoT and Horns of Discipline and Fist of Horn for H2H with
FBSS), so I'm willing to spend a little plat on him.
