That's exactly it.  If I'm not busy, I'll generally do rezzes for free
(though I accept donations and remember those who are generous - the
druid who gave me a copy of Improved IVU for a res is on my list of
people I'll actually go out of my way to res in future :-)

My standard response when I don't have time is "Sorry, but I'm busy
right now".  There's a startling number of people out there who don't
seem to understand the meaning of the word "busy".

Oh, and more thing: people who use "u" or "plz" can pretty much expect
that I'll be "busy" :-)  Same applies to complete strangers who call me
"bro" or "friend".
