Hellooo. Can anyone say "missed notes"? Good luck keeping a /melody playing 
for any length of time unattended. Missed notes are a big problem for all 
bards. After thinking about this, the only downside I can see is that now I 
almost hope they *don't* reduce the frequency of missed notes...almost. 
Heck, this might just be reason enough for them to warrant not doing so.
