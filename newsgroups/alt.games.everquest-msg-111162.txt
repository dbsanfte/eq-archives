Here's why not to trade with bags.
Bags go into trade window as do (more often than not)  individual items,
trade is cancelled (whether or not buyer wants an item) individual items
return FIRST and bags follow to find that there is no long enough slots for
them, bag(s) fall, time measured for the length of time a dropped bag lasts
in the EC tunnel can be measured in milli seconds.
I am always suspicious of people looking for bag sellers but not concerned
with what they are selling, questioned one once, asking what class or sort
of items he was after, you know what he said?
"I am looking for someone who is selling bags of stuff"
Hmmm...

> Just show it to me, dangit!

When auctioning I often don't add the stats to old items but on newer ones I
will add as much detail as I can to the auction, if the item is low end I
nearly always add the stats for newbies and ALWAYS add the price.
What pisses me off is when people send me tells with "what are you selling"
Read the fricking auctions, if they go by to fast, make the window bigger,
if the colour doesn't show up, change it. I am not typing it all out again
in a tell. I don't mind answering questions about an item, weight,
class/race even stats (numbers will not always show with some VGA
cards/chips.
As for "show me what you are selling" Not a chance, what do you need to know
about it and I'll tell you,  if you don't trust me you can always double
check before hitting trade and cancel, if that's too much trouble then you
didn't want it in the first place.
