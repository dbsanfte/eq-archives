The CD was not opened and the guy had a very good ebay rating, no complaints
and LOTS of sales.  It's a factory original and it was factory sealed..

I'll look into that, I was led to believe that you had to buy them 90days
worth at a time for $40+ a pop...

It works. At least it is for lots of other Linux folks .
The game starts, automatically connects to the eq servers checks for and
downloads all the updates.  It's given me every indication that it will
work but until I see it go online and really play I don't want to throw
money away for nothing.

What about someone that is already a regular player (that I know), can they
log on from my machine with their account just to verify that my machine is
fully operational??

Thanks..
