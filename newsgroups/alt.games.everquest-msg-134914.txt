Is it worth pointing out that "freedom" and "rights" and "emancipation" and
"indiviualism" are all very well, but that there can only ever be an
approximation of these things?  The more rights one has, the more
limitations have to imposed in order to prevent my right from infringing on
your right.  It's remarkably paradoxical really.

American's and most of the occidental world have already achieved as much
"freedom" as they can possibly hope to sustain - now they have their rights
for themselves, they ought to start thinking about their responsibilities
towards others.  Australia does not have a Bill of Rights, but no-one would
deny we are a free country.  What Australia needs to do is to try and
cultivate less of the nationalistic, individualistic focus it is inheriting
from the US.  Perhaps a Bill of Resbonsibility instead?  How would that
work?  I'm not a constitutional lawyer.  But there is a huge psychological
shift between the mind set of a statement like, for eg, "All refugees have
the right to be treated humanely" and the alternative statement "It is our
responsibility to treat all refugees humanely."
