That is a lag warp. Discrepency between what is actually happening on
the server and what your client software 'thinks' is happening. Happens
all the time get used to it. All you can do is be aware of it and try and
anticipate it. It gets worse the worse your connection is.

Mob was stuck under the world. Have to kill it with spells or you must
zone or gate away. This happens a lot in the field of bone, and East karana.

Hmmm that is a weird one. Sounds like more lag issues, was her lag-o-meter
red or spiking red?

Yes and it leads to a lot of kill stealing accusations and arguments. Basically
your client software is getting the positional update for the mobs sooner that
the positional update for the PCs. The closer you get to a PC the more frequent
the updates from the server for their position. This is designed to reduce the
information load sent to your client. Your client software doesnt' need the positional
information for ALL the PCs in the zone ALL the time.

There may have been a shaman orc that was healing him close by. The
gob may have been above you or on the other side of the wall. Mobs
don't need line of site to their friends to cast heals or buffs, just think
of them as always grouped with each other. =)

A lot of the time it depends on the zone. Some zones have bad warping
and pathing problems. Qeynos hills used to be really bad for warping
but it is a lot better now. Sometimes verant can find and fix the issue
and sometimes not.
