It was never true.
The original JBoots were rare loads on a level 25ish mob in Nejena.
It made Nejena just about the most camped zone when the game was first
released.

They changed the JBoots to a quest and SPECIFICALLY made sure Hasten's
quest dialog told folks that killing him will not result in the boots.
