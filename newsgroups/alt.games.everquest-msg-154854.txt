I went for the regen myself first. First aid is nice but its situational.
You have bandage during down time, and you are vulnerable while
you do it.

Regen is on all the time. 3 points per tick, every tick, sitting, standing,
running, fighting. All the time. Unlike first aid It heals you no matter
where your current hit point percentage is, 70% 80% 90% whatever.
That's 30 points a minute, EVERY minute you are logged into your
character.
