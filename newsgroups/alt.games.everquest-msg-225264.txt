White and yellow mobs don't give you the HCB - they are max level
54 and they need to be 55.

Also, fewer high level mobs definitely DO give better returns now.

A level 60 gives me 2x or better the xp of a 59- mob.

You just need to hunt the right mobs - in PoN they are the gobbys
and mephits.  (mephits were yellow/red to my then 54 kitty).
