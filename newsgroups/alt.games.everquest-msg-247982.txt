I keep a character parked in the bazaar to be trade mule, check on
prices in the bazaar, and make purchases for my other characters. I
keep the character parked, when not in use, in one of the bazaar's
banks.

Occasionally I see the little bags indicating that someone dropped
something on the ground. Usually it's foraged roots or something. One
time, though, I picked up a pair of boots. Dropped it in the inventory
figuring somebody had old, no longer usable boots and left them for
any passerby to pick up.

A few minutes later, a half elf (elf?) female is moving frantically
around the bank (this is all occuring on the inside) and comes over
asking if I'd picked up anything.

Being honest (maybe to a fault) I admitted to picking up something.
Checked the boots, Boots of Flowing Slime! Although the stats were jaw
dropping [to me], I passed them back without comment.

Then she asked about a Cloak of Flames (I think that's it). She
clearly didn't believe me when I told her I didn't have it. She asked
me several times about it. No threats on her part or anything but
obviously a nifty item had gotten lost. She went around /ooc if anyone
had found a Cloak of Flames. I camped out to switch to another
character on the PoK.

Like any player, I would be thrilled to find a FT item though I'd feel
sorry for whoever lost it. I could have kept the item and handed back
just about any forage item (making like that was what I found) but
that never entered my mind. I know I would have liked the booties, but
I am satisfied that I did the right thing.

Though, the player should have been more careful with stuff like that.
