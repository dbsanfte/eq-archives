Very true. I have also. But I do suspect that perhaps most players
like to make a bit of progress be that XP or questing or crafting in a
play session. I don't suspect many folks log in prepared to gain
little or nothing from the session apart from the die hard role
players, high levels, guild officers etc. But I do whole heartedly
agree that fun comes far before grinding out XP for me as well.
