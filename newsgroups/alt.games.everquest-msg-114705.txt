As a 200 fletcher half elf, wood elf fletching just doesnt bother me. I'm a
Tunare lover, and the fact Tunare lovers seem to get all the perks *does*, it
would seem far fairer for the Faydark Thunderbolt (yummy bow ;) No more DN
farming!) to be a Karana treat as we already get the helm of the tracker,
but, uh, you wont hear me complaining *too* hard about that ;)

And lets face it. Humans make interesting looking kick bootie rangers. If I
see one more wood elf, I'll puke.
