You can try going to Best buy or somewhere like that and pick up a copy 
of the Prima books.  Not everything in the books are absolutely correct 
but they will help you, especially now when you don't know even the 
basics yet.  If you have to choose which book to buy, buy the Kunark 
one.  That one has a useful spell listing, and has alot of info on each 
of the classes.  I like flipping to the class page and asking group 
members if they have such-and-such buff or nuke.  Kind of freaks people 
out sometimes that I know what spells and skills they should have.

The first book in the series, just says 'Everquest Players Guide' on the 
front, only buy that one if it is the only one you can find.  It's 
pretty useless and the stuff in there is covered in the Kunark one. 
Just because you don't have Kunark yet, don't think you can't use the 
book, you will find it invaluable.

Most of the stuff in the Luclin book is not needed unless you buy the 
Luclin expansion.  And I very rarely use that one anyway.

Good luck.
