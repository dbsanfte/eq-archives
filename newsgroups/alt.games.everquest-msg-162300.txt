Ok; well say you started out with -2000 faction points, with 300 kills you'd
still only be -1700, still scowling by a whole lot.

I'm in a pretty similar boat with my iksar necro.  Out of pure evilness i've
chosen to become friendly with the freeport militia, and have been killing
nfp peoples to raise my faction, it's taking forever, i'm threatening now
and the mobs I kill are dark blue, at 45, and will take a long long time to
raise.  But hey; I might level up a few times while I do it. =).

/sigh  Took 3 days to get from bottomed out faction with coldain to be
dubious.

Good luck,
Dea
