Just pre-ordered LoY. Man, I'm weak. I clicked on my Everquest icon today,
totally oblivious of the new expansion.. and suddenly, there it was, staring
me in the face. I couldn't resist. I had to have it.

So now I'm in the hole 18$ American, lol. But whatever, better than going to
Compusmart to find out they don't have it =P
