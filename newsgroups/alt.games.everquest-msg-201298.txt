After a bit of fiddling with some maths ( an a couple of mistakes that 
cost me an hour or 2) I can unveil the all singing (almost :-P) all 
dancing "How quick will I level compaired to my group mates" formular.

Note that this does no sing or dance.
In fact it ignores lots of factors :
Player race
Player class (I don't think this is an issue any longer)
Fighting mobs that are green / light blue to some people in the group
Fighting mobs that give SO much xp that the gain is capped for the 
lowest members.

Still here it is to compair two characters in ANY sized group you only 
need to know 2 things their levels, and the "fudged modifier for that 
level" as discussed above. (Note that noone to my knowledge has the 
"right numbers" so I will include a my best guess below)

The formular is :

(CL1 +5) / (mod1 *((CL1)3 - (CL1-1)3)
:
(CL2 +5) / (mod2 *((CL2)3 - (CL2-1)3)

CL1 = player1's level
CL2 = Player2's level
(CL1)3 = the cube of CL1 i.e. CL1 * CL1 * CL1

Note that this means that the relitive leveling speed of 2 characters in 
a group is not dependent on the group size, or the other members of the 
group. Or the Zem or what level mobs are being hunted (with the proviso 
above about extreem high / low mobs)

For example a level 45 char will level 3.16 times faster than a level 60 
char in the same group.

The values I used for the modifier / fudge factor are as follows :
