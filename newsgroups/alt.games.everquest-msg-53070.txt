Hey, to be fair to the guy, there is a strong possibility of being screwed
out of a bunch of hard-earned stuff...  For example... Our "uptight dude"
takes the person up on the trade...  The other person then takes every item
from him, then calls Verant up and changes the password on the account he
traded away...  (since Verant's rules are that he is the only
owner, -ever-..)...  So, our "uptight dude" just got screwed out of
everything...
