Yes, actually they do.   When Unix was first introduced in the late
1970's, it included the operating system source code.  Back in the old
days, we used to actually do operating system code reviews and analyze
every aspect of the system.

Unix allowed you to easily tune the operating system kernel to
establish performance based on your requirements.  Tons of systems
management and security applications were developed that allowed for a
full benchmarking of Unix and its variants so you could really see
what the heck was going on.

Debugging applications wasn't fun or easy - but you could actually pop
up a screen with a debugger in it and trace the calls of an
application every step of the way.  

The compilers, debuggers and tracing kits were part of the OS
distribution.
