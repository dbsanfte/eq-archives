That's just denying reality. Feel free to line up your list of
negatives, unless you have something new I can knock them down just by
quoting earlier posts.

"Make it too easy to level" - the changes are too minor to make any
significant difference

"Won't learn their class" - the changes happen to characters of such
low level they aren't learning anything class relevant anyways.

"Hell levels are a rite of passage" - they were, yes, but that in no
way validates their existance. The only reason people seem to like
them is to punish those trying to get through them because *they* had
to go through them.

"The changes appeal to lowest common denominator" - the expectation
that such minor changes are going to dumb down the game assumes a much
greater impact than is likely to occur. This is the chicken little
argument.

"Losing the spellbook was something to be earned, not given" - even if
we ignore the fact the spellbook was there to L50 originally (and the
argument is therefore hypocritical), it still remains a DUMB design
decision that hasn't been defended by Verant in years except as part
of the Vision. I still can't believe someone thinks staring at a
spellbook is fun. Sometimes I wonder if all those people laughing at
EQ players because of their willingness to put up with stupid things
like the spellbook might be right after all.... Nah!

Those are the ones I could remember off the top of my head. What other
arguments do you have?

You're going to pull out roleplaying reasons for the spellbook?

I will remind you that this is a game. Just because you're masochistic
about it doesn't mean everyone else should be forced to. If YOU want
to roleplay the spellbook, YOU can still do it.

>how CR is different at certain levels.

Permit me some selfishness of my own. This change isn't for the
benefit of the players, its for the benefit of the guides and GMs who
don't have to deal with idiot twinks losing all their gear anymore.
It's not well known, but L5 and under are never given reimbursals.
Period. For anything.

I suppose it IS for the benefit of the players too stupid to help
themselves.

I don't accept any roleplaying reasons to dislike the changes, sorry.
If you don't want to have the advantages from a roleplaying
perspective, then *you* don't have to do it. At least permit other
people the option, don't force your roleplaying beliefs down their
throats.

The sky is not falling. I've seen far too many gloom and doom
predictions from people from patches the last three years to take
yours any more seriously. They didn't turn out to be a problem, why
should this one.

That is just being deliberately dense, and I wonder if you know what
non sequitur even means from this absurdity. The analogy was valid -
you can be afraid of things that have no logical reason to occur, but
don't give them any more weight than they deserve.

Your definition of significant is interesting. Getting rid of the
spellbook is extending a previous change to earlier levels - it will
have zero effect on the game other than letting the players have a bit
more awareness, a *good* thing. The faster leveling and no corpse
recovery only affects L1-10, an insignificant time period. The other
changes are mostly just cosmetic additions, like new hybrid races and
expanded spell lines. Along with upping dungeon bonuses in the lowbie
dungeons. Chat channels are a welcome addition and hell levels are a
welcome removal. What exactly is being hurt again?

Argumentum ad antiquitatem for the first part, as for the second, the
idea that the game is "easier" is obviously subjective but I still
believe you grossly overestimate the sum total of the effects.

The idea that the features will lead to an invasion of griefers and
idiots is a classic non sequitur. Your only "proof" is a couple of
coworker griefers who couldn't handle the leveling curve. Also, no
evidence given how the griefers would be any more effective at a
*slightly* higher level.

And the non sequitur again. I see no proof for the argument that the
spellbook kept griefers out here. Nor do I see any proof that removing
it will bring them in. And frankly I find the idea the griefers were
just waiting for the spellbook to be gone to be ludicrous. You're
going to extreme examples to prove your case, and its showing.

FWIW and as an aside there were no global rollbacks in EQ. There were
two big ones limited to individual (Nameless and Tribunal) servers,
both about 9 months after release. Going on....

The significance of the changes is in doubt here. The sky is not
falling. The changes are minor to 95% of the playing population 95% of
the time.

Slippery slope. No evidence given that there will be more changes, or
that they will be bad.

I don't understand this, did you mean MUST *happen* more often? I'll
remind you we knew there were changes left out of Luclin to make a
shipping date.
