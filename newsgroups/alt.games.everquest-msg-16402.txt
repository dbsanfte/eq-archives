	Water.  It's the best general purpose elemental.  It's not the
best at any one thing, but neither is it the worst.  It has the AC and
the HP to tank for you when you're soloing, and has the damage output
to be a viable group member.

	For your first two pet levels (Level 4 and 8), don't buy
anything but Earth or Water.  Air and Fire pets die very quickly at
these levels and soloing with either an Air pet or a Fire pet is a
good way to wind up back at your spawn point buck nekkid.  Air pets
don't really become a viable solo pet until 12th level IMHO.  Fire
pets never become a viable solo pet that I can see.

	Earth pets are comparatively useless in a group.  They have
the slowest attack speed, and their high HP is wasted in a group
context because they won't be doing much tanking in any case.

	Fire pets are extremely useless for soloing (IMHO).  When
you're soloing, you need a pet that can take the beats while you nuke
the MOB from afar.  Fire Elementals will often die when a nearby
non-Aggro MOB sneezes.  They have the lowest HP of any of the pets, so
you're not going to get a lot of use out of their innate fireshield
before they crumple like a used Kleenex and the MOB comes after you.
And Mage + Angry MOB + No pet = Dead Mage.

	In general, for soloing, use Earth, Air, or Water.  When
grouped, use Air, Water, or Fire.

	When grouped, turn off pet taunt with the /pet no taunt
command.  This way the MOB will aggro the tanks of the group (whose
health can be easily seen by the group clerics) and not on your pet
(whose health can only be seen by you unless one of your party members
clicks on him).
