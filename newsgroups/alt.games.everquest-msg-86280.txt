No. I like not having Luclin ports. It might be inconvenient at times,
but it helps show that there is a difference between wizard magic (raw
power gained by studying) and druid magic (havily bound to
nature/norrath) and the differences between wizard spires and druid
rings. For the same reason, I don't want more Luclin portals, since
all the huge wizard spires are utilized already. I like having as much
consistency as possible in the game world, thank you... there are
enough odd things as it is.
