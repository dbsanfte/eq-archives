Whoa!
Us fix it? How we gonna do that since this didnt start till after a
patch? This is not our problem to fix its sony's. Look at the facts:
1. Only one zone involved. 
2. Doesnt seem to relate to number of peeps in zone have seen it with
40 or 400
3. Various symtoms LD, crash to desk top, no problems, etc
4. Have seen many traders go LD in bunches, dozens of peeps just gone,
Doesnt sound like our problem does it.
5. SoE has bugged the code in the bazaar , why is that so hard to
believe? Or is it that there is no problem unless YOU are having
problems?????

And I still maintain this is being done to lower BW on EQ for Sonys
benefit not ours, remember SWG is coming out soon. Game was fine
before 56k worked as well as it could. So the changes were NOT to
improve our game play.
