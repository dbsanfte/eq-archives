The /quit command makes you go LD (Link Dead).  I think it takes up to a 
minute for the server to remove LD characters from the zone.  So, if you 
used it when being chased by a mob you're more than likely to get beaten 
to death and not even know it. 

It does make me wonder how many people get bored of a group and type 
/quit, faking a disconnect, instead of just saying they've had enough and 
disbanding.

Andy.
