First, let me say that emoticons are an annoyance
to me, nothing more. I don't take offence to
anyone using them, and certainly do not seek to
impose my standards of behaviour on anyone else. I
accept them in the same way as I accept dood
speak.

I realise that some people are dependent upon such
devices, otherwise how would they know when to
laugh, or raise an eyebrow, or wipe their ass. To
some people a clear instruction on how they should
react, is absolutely necessary.

Emoticons to me seem like those instructions that
go up on TV shows, demanding laughter or applause,
and although I have never been in a studio
audience, I have the feeling I might take an
instant dislike to those commands on the placards.

Even worse is the advanced form of emoticon
(sarcasm on/sarcasm off). Thats not sarcasm, thats
a plea for English 101.

Of course its adequate for Usenet, its the
limitations of both readers and writers
imaginations, that it tries (and, I think fails
miserably), to overcome.

So you wouldn't use emoticons with 'rich text'?

Its a two-way (at the least) thing, you have to
write for your audience.

Its like telling a joke, and whether you fuck up
the punchline or not, telling your audience "Its
time to laugh guys"

I disagree.

You are right, I accept the criticism. When they
divided people up into those groups of visual,
tactile, and aural, I got stuck with aural.

I do stick my nose up at emoticons... perhaps I
might be persuaded to use them if there were an
emoticon that signified that feeling.

What I do dislike intensely, and what put me off
them to start with, was the use of an insult
accompanied by a smiley, such as;

"Fuck off, you ignorant piece of shit" :-),

as if the insult were somehow negated by that
inclusion.

Thank you for letting me rant on about this, I
needed to get it out of my system, and if you got
this far, I hope you realise that just about all
of the preceding paragraphs could have ended with
a :-).

Don't you think that was patronising of me?
