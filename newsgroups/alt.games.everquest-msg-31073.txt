My problem with the TLC is that so far, the developers have
demonstrated that they often DON'T have a clue when it comes to
cohesive design.  OK, I exaggerate, it's more a matter of with so much
content being made by so many people, things are going to slip through
the cracks... a lot of things, in all liklihood.  I won't be surprised
to learn of multiple major quests being "broken" due to the TLC.  I
guess what I'm saying is that the TLC is an added level of complexity
in an already complex world.  It's something else the designers have
to keep track of, when they already have demonstrated that it is
impossible for them to keep track of everything else all the time. 


Ask any troubleshooter or engineer, the more complex the object, the
more parts you have in it, the more likely it is to break.  Same thing
works for any system, mechanical, electrical or, in this case, rules.
The TLC is an unneeded complication, to my mind.  Besides, there's
something about them that I instinctively don't like, can't explain it
any better than that.  To the point that I don't think I'm going to
waste my time with Luclin.
