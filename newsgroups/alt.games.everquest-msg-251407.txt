If the dungeons are too difficult for this, you could deliberately seek 
out lower level people to serve as your buffer; get the average level of 
your group down so you get the lower level LDoN.

I've soloed in LDoN's a bit with my mage, it is possible but by no means 
easy; what's happened is that our group has left after a success, and is 
disbanding, so I stay inside and kill a few more till the half hour runs 
out...or I run out, with a massive overpull on my butt and my pet dead. 
  No way of single pulling, no slow, mage isn't really designed for this!

Splendid
