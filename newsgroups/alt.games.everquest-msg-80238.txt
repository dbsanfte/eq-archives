Thanks all for the helpful suggestions  and the MONK 101 primer.

I'm now drinking chai now and eating unlevened bread baked on a rock in the
Desert of North Ro.

I'll be on perpetual *quest* for those low weight MONK Items it seems. Any
suggestions how a low level MONK (almsot 8 at the monet) should go about this? 
Typically, what  can I purchase or commission from a tailor that would help me
along?  Where, who, how do I acquire the magical WU armor and weapons? How much
approximately?

Thanks in advance.

David
