Well, I haven't posted, but I think you're being silly.  I enjoy tradeskills 
very much.  I think the success rates are about right and fairly logical.

I didn't realize we were expected to vote.

As to the metal bits, think of it like this.  In real life, I use an electron 
microscope a lot, to take pictures.  It's a fairly complicated process, but 
not as complicated as you might think.  It's very much like using a 35mm 
camera, really.  Find the thing you want, line it up in the middle, focus, 
click the button.  Now, despite it being fairly simple, there's still a 
failure rate of about 95 in 100 for my actual project.  It turns out that the 
particular sample was overdyed or underdyed, that the exposure time wasn't 
exactly right, that the sample grid was sloped in a way that threw the focus 
off, or that it just wasn't a very good sample.

I can easily see it being the same with metal bits.  You got a bad block of 
ore.  The bits melted into a fairly unusable shape for the project you had in 
mind.  Whatever.  But at some point, you stop learning new tricks from trying 
to do better at it, and that point comes way before being very successful at 
it.
