I like the giant fort in FM for a bit of quick pp.  The plat drops are
negligable but the items make up for it.

Weapons sell for about 15pp
Belt / Hat about 12pp
Tunic about 60pp
Earrings (rarer drop) 280pp

The giants have low HP, around 1250 to 2500 & respawn at a heck of a
rate.  They only hit for around 50 so dont cause much of a problem.  I
can do about 500pp in around 30 mins without including earrings.  I
use a summoned pet with haste & NDT then wander around agroing the
giants & letting the pet kill & AR take the hits.  I'll sometimes
throw in the odd nuke which generally drops them in one shot.

The only drawbacks are, its a bit out of the way without a handy
vendor to sell stuff at & some of the weapon drops are Lore (althought
the axes arn't & they are visbile on the mob).
