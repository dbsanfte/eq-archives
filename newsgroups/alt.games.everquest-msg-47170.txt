But chicks like lizards

Just to add a few you missed
1) AC BONUS. That thing is *very* noticeable
2) some equipment that humans can't wear. I'm sure it works both ways, 
but I seemed to have noticed more stuff for lizards
3) Cool quests for actually useful things
4) hilarious FD animation. Second best next to ogres

> -- Doesn't need to carry food because they can forage.
Actually, I preferred to carry food, it's lighter

> -- HP Regen
Not too much, but still very nice. It helps quite a bit when you FD'ed 
and trying to decide if it will be the poison that kills you, or the 
monster standing next to you

> -- Tail attack
Not very relevant -- humans get a similar thing at same level. Different 
name and different animation

And best bind area in Kunark

KOS matters fairly little once you get FD. I did bank in Kelethin, and 
did take a boat from Freeport to Faydwer for fun once

What can I say. We lizards are sexy

Not only that. You also get drained of air slower. I believe I tested it 
with my bard against my monk. Both had swimming skill just above 190, 
and the lizard could hold his breath almost twice longer
