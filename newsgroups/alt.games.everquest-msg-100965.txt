Not even one year for me. Currently In EQ I go month by month, their
price increase only solidifies this decision MORE. Too many other
mmorpgs are in the works where I feel I'd be GETTING MORE (newer
better game engine, etc) for $12.95 or more per month. Getting the
same poor CS and screwed up patches and bugs for that is going to get
very old very fast.
