A couple of reasons I've noticed that I like shrink for, even maximum
shrink.  First, in dungeons where the mobs are short or close to the ground,
it helps to stay on them when you are short enough to actually see them
(when playing in 1st person mode of course) and avoids the "You cannot see
your target" or out of range messages and therefore less damage.  Also when
mages or wizards are using bolt spells that require line of sight it is
helpful to keep groupmates out of the way.  And also as someone else pointed
out, it makes it easier to target mobs through your group members if they
are shorter.

I can understand why it is annoying though, with my BL I always ask who
wants shrink when I have it up and usually get answers like 1 shot or 2
shots of shrink please.  Being a troll I always shrink myself and sometimes
even max shrink myself.

To each their own, but would be nice if people would ask first.
