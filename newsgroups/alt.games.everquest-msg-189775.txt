My first and only character is a Barbarian Shaman.  I picked this character
because it would work well with the group that my boyfriend plays with, and
I felt it was most "like me".  Have her go through the book, read about the
races and classes, find out which ones interest her, then help her choose if
you are planning on playing together (i hope so).  Not knowing what level
you are, please remember that she will be below your level and will often
times feel left out if you are off "playing with the big boys".  This caused
some problems here because I was helped so much at first, then got left
behind, and I didn't make the adjustment very well.  I'm getting it now,
though.  Just make sure she gets solo experience, or she will get
frustrated.  Speaking from experience, it can be rather overwhelming to be
hanging out at Nexxus with some bad ass players, or should I say
intimidating?  I constantly worry that I will screw up and do something
really stupid.  So depending on her personality, she may need some TLC at
times... just don't blow her off in the middle of an adventure.
