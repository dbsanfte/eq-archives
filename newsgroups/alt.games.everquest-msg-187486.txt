Yeah regen help a heck of a lot, but watch out for Iksars they have limit on
what armour they can wear, which is not a good thing for a tanking class.

Ogres also have the advantage of not being stunned from the front, very
helpful for a casting class thats going to be in the thick of it.

And if you have the money go for an iksar cemermonal breastplate (sp ?) They
can got for as little as 4.5k and make a HUGE diffrence if you want to solo,
or just keep your healers downtime down (of course if you really have alot
of cash a fungis even better)
