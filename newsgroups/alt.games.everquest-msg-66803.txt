Actually, IBMs were NEVER a good product.  They were above average for
the most part.  What they leveraged off was their earlier reputation
on big iron.  In reality, IBM has done more to screw up the PC than
any single company could have managed and still not go under.

The components IBM put into their PCs were/are the SAME components
that companies like Dell, Gateway, Compaq put into theirs.

The $60 is the price delta for RDRAM vs. SDRAM.
256MB of SDRAM is about $20.
256MB of RDRAM is listed at $76.

That's a price delta of $56.

Not really.
It's still proprietary junk with middling performance and reliability.

The arguement infavor of IBMs isn't the PC, but the support for that
PC.  In that area, it's hard to beat a large company with the
logistics in place to handle the support needs.
