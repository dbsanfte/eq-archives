IIRC, they said that the same spell cast by different characters
was supposed to stack, and they specificly stated that different
spells of the same line cast by different characters would not
stack.  This is not how it is working.  I've played around with
my 25 Druid and found that, as others have noted, Stinging Swarm
stacks with Creeping Crud now.  Simple observation of how many
casts it takes to kill a mob, and the fact that you get seperate
"has worn off" messages at the correct time, makes this clear.
I have not grouped with another Druid to try stacking identical
spells cast by different characters, but I believe this is
working also from comments I've heard.  I've no idea when they're
gonna get around to changing it to work the way the announced it
was going to, but they've never been shy about changing things
that sit "broken" for a time (sometimes a long time, remember the
"haste bug" where any item haste + any haste spell would get you
to the haste cap?).  Since this does reduce the already low risk
involved in root/dot or dot/kite tactics (sooner the mob dies the
less risk an add poses, sooner the mob dies the less chance the
mob somehow gets on you) tactics I would be surprised if they
leave it as it is for too long.  At least you don't have to be
concerned about being warned for exploiting, heh, can you imagine
them trying to get every Druid, Necro, and Shaman in the game to
voluntarily play as if they had implemented stacking the way they
said they were going to?
