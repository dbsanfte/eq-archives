Yes, he's talking about the Coldain "city part", not the
dungeon part down the well.

The guards drop decent No Drop plate armor, roughly as good
as the class-specific Planes armor (e.g., for a Paladin,
better than Ro, worse than Deepwater, close to a toss-up
for Valorium).

They also drop those nifty round shields made of ice.
