/agree It seems like they want all commerce to be between same
alignments etc.  They are removing common from the language pool and
only allowing the human language to be implemented to be known to a few
others.  My guess is Half-elves (but only those that start in
freeport/qeynos/surefall, Erudites, Humans, Barbarians, and Possibly
Dark elves will speak human.  I would imagine there will be no common
language for anyone on g'fay other than wood elves/high elves.  and none
of them will be able to speak human.  It looks like this player based
economy they try to foster with the crap that merchants pay for items,
will be non existant on this server.  I can understand that ogres and
trolls would be less likely to know human, but there needs to be some
kind of common language, otherwise this scenario will develop.

Exactly their whole idea of roleplaying is that if you are evil there is
no reason to group with good, etc.  So much for common enemies, such as
in the commons area the Deathfist orcs.  They are there on the borders
of the DE territory, Halfling territory, human territory, but god forbid
any of those should ever work together against the common foe.  And What
about Tiny Miller, an Ogre raised by humans....

My only guess here is the TCC was already in place on the new server
when they did their poll, and rather than rewrite all of the code
again....  It might not be as bad, with everyone starting out as
newbies, but I still see huge problems, and can't imagine how many
quests are going to be broken on the new server.

Or maybe every group will require a Wizard now.  How that will work I
don't know, but I would imagine wizards will become more popular for
groups since they will be needed for evacs/porting the dead cleric back
to the dungeon to rez the melee's.
