I'm looking for some information on the Plane of mischief. If anyone
knows of a good published guide, that would be great. Otherwise, some
very basic questions:

Can groups of raiders with good CoV faction pretty much just make it to
the entrance? Or do you have to fight your way to it anyway?

What sort of faction hits, if any, do you incur there?

What levels/classes would be a minimum for an exploratory raid there?

Any particular dangers, good spots, mobs, loot, etc. to be on the
lookout for?

I have never paid any attention to PoM and nobody I know raids there. My
knowledge of it is zero beyond knowing it exists.
