This is no longer true. In all the "friendly" zones (PoK, PoTq, Bazaar,
Guild Lobby, etc) detrimental spells cannot be successfully cast any more,
so you can't get skill ups on them there. There are a lot of zones with
spots where you can practice safely: starting cities, HHK courtyard, the
fishing docks in the karanas, Abysmal Sea, Arena, etc. There are many spots
where you can combine spell practice with fishing (while facing north
even!), if you enjoy that sort of thing. Cast hostile spells on a pet, if
you have one, since they won't be affected. Otherwise cast them on yourself.
You will be affected by them, so watch that you don't kill yourself. Nuking
or dotting yourself is an excellent opportunity for Bind Wound practice,
too. If you're a bard needing to practice PBAoE songs while afk overnight,
Arena is an excellent choice with no risk of tagging friendly guards or
wandering mobs.


One other thing to comment on.... there *is* a way to get the Kobold Skull
Charm even if you are past the level where you can enter the tutorial. The
good and evil newbie armor task guys in PoK will give you a Kobold Skull
Charm when you complete the First Task if you don't already have one.
It's one of the better charms in the game for the under 50 crowd, and well
worth getting for your older alts who are past the Tutorial stage.
