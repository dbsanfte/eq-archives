I don't recall seeing twinks as a (serious) problem until after Velious. EQ
started downhill with Luclin and they haven't slowed down since. As a
matter of fact I believe GoD *really* opened that up with the silly book
travel BS and the shared bank slots.

Again this was not a serious problem until late in the expansion game with
EQ1. After the "super buffs" in Luclin (KEI, etc) were when this really
started.

Yes, and staring at the book. Which means nothing since they took them out.

EQ2 doesn't seem to have hell levels - it seems more like a hell hike. The
further up in levels you get the farther you are behind the curve.
