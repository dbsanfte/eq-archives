Of course, clerics get stamina spells (Invigor and Extinguish Fatigue), so
hopefully they can get one of these off before they die so you can run.

However, it's the standard part view of stats we content with.  As a cleric
I can see everyones HP's, and even the mobs; but no idea what mana and
stamana is on the others until they tell the group (or all of a sudden the
warrior is swinging slower and hitting less).

So on the group status window I want all 3 entries show.  HP, Mana, Stamana.
dream on I know, but hey we can all dream...
