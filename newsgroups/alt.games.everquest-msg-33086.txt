HALFLING!!!!!!!!

I may be a bit biased, but we ROCK!  Sure, our STR is a bit low, but there's
a LOT of +str items out there, and the natural dex/agi makes our combat
skills go up faster than those lumbering behemoth ogres/trolls, or even
barbs, as well as having a slightly higher wis/int for skill ups, and we get
a racial exp bonus, halfling warriors take the least exp to level, with the
exception of halfling rogues, who take the absolute least (note: this is
just going by the numeric exp value for race/class combos, not ZEM or
anything). and besides, Misty Thicket is THE best newbie zone, 1-10 easy,
Paineel is better 1-4, but Misty just rocks (and you can make money there,
sell misty acorns that you pick up, and kill bears a bit later on for HQ
pelts, its also closer to EC than Paineel is).

Besides, we don't have the issues that the large guys do with getting into
small places, after all, when's the last time you saw an ogre unshrunk in
Sol A?
