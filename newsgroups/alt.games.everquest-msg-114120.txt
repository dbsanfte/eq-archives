The spell is sold at the herb shop attached to the caster guild in
Qeynos (near the bank). The vendor is a male human on the far right as
you enter the building. You will not be able to buy the spell
yourself, because they do not like Barnarians. You will have to find
someone you trust to buy it for you, if you want to avoid the trip to
the Gypsies in Oasis that will sell the spell to you.

Also...You REALLY need to learn more weapon skills. There are some
great 1HB and !HPiercing (eg Shaman Epic) weapons out there. The other
advantage to using a 1H weapon is that it will free up your left hand
so that you can hold items that will increase your mana, wis, AC, etc
etc.
