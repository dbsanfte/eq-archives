   I did, in SolA also, oddly enough.  I was grouped with a dwarf
paladin, who, if I remember right, was yellow to me.  Mana permitting,
from time to time, I would whack the occasional baddy.  With my staff of
Living Sand, I was landing several 48 hits.  He was amazed that I was
hitting harder than he was (don't know what he was using).  That was
fun!

cleric.
