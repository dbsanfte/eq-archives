Blah,Blah,Blah...

I personally believe that the 8 slot limitation makes you really have to
think about choosing the right spell/song for the group or specific
occasion.  As you stated in another thread, DAoC has more available spell
slots, but everything I've heard about that game is it's been made so much
easier to play that there is not much challenge involved.  I may be wrong,
but all these people that keep complaining that EQ should be more like DAoC
should really go play the latter since that is the game they apparently
prefer.
