And when I have free time I can do some work / watch a movie / read
something / talk on the fone whilst doing a camp.

Well I wouldn't say I enjoy them, but I've found plenty of ways of combining
a camp into every day stuff.  Housework?  Sure: kill ph.. hoover,  kill ph,
polish. Whatever i need to do, most of it can have a camp fit into it.  And
like i said, that camp was a rare event.

/care on.  Im sorry, I don't do things to impress you.  Matter of fact I
don't give 2 fucks bout you.

What true colours would they be?  That people who demand and expect items on
a silver platter piss me off?  Yeah, they do.  I've never made an effort to
deny that.

Like I said, I don't do it to impress you.

By the sounds of it, your the one who needs to bring "my dads bigger than
your dad!" into it.

I don't need to brag about her looks, my looks, my salary, my point was
"power games" still have normal lives too, you can call me out for being
sad, having no life out the game, or whatever your mind thinks is a trait of
a power gamer... the simple truth is I probably do the very same stuff in
life that you and anybody else does here.

If you say "im a 52 druid, i tried to camp the AC to make phat money!  It
didnt pop!  I QUIT THIS FKIN GAME!"  then I'll tell you to shut the fuck up.

If you make a general post about looting/rare mobs/loots then I'll read it
and if necessary (likely) reply.  Don't assume I like the current system or
think its fine how it is.

Its not an argument/rant about loot I have a problem with, its greedy morons
whining like they have a god given right to something that rile me.

> Your maturity overwhelms me.

Then I guess were on the same level now.
