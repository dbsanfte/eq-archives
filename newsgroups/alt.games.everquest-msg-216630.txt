Your ignorance shows again.  Find me a melee that does 270DPS
in optimum circumstances.  62 water has been parsed at 90DPS in
optimum circumstances.  Epic is nearly as high on mobs <60th
where there procs land.  64 warders and 61 air pets come in at
70+ from the back.  The top necro pet is right there too.

An all pet group will see 450-500 dps from pets alone - then
there's the small matter of nukes (no dots, because mobs don't
last long enough)

Oh, my regular groupmate is a 65 ranger with 140aa, including
AM3/EQ, with a Stonewood bow and the new Karana arrows 
(11dam + 4cold IIRC) - so yes, I do group with DPS classes.

In fact, he's a great addition to a pet group because he doesn't
need to be healed.
