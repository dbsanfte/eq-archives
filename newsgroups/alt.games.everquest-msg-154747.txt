Have you tried using F9 for different views? This relys on you knowing where
you are going, although you could fiddle with the views a bit untill you
have one that looks forward a little, but still mostly at the ground.

As a chanter I use F9 a lot. Extremely useful on large scale raids where
mezzing is needed. Will even use when not, just so used to it.

Cheers
