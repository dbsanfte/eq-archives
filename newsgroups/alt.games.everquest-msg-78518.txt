I never did have a lizzie, even when Kunark was on my puter. I thought about
it, but never did it. I'll get my hard drive prayed over and see if it
survived, then I'll probably reroll her. I don't suppose a lizzie can wear
halfling armor, can she? Oh, I read something somewhere about the guys
(Tonsmith?) in Commons being able to resize armor. Maybe I'll check into
that, I had some nice stuff. Oh, nevermind, a necro can't wear anything but
silk, so that leaves that out. Oh well.
