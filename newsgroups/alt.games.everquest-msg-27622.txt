The Sleeper was killing GMs.  GMs can kill anything, but they have to
type a command to do it.  Mobs normally won't attack a GM unless the
GM attacks first, but evidently, the Sleeper was not obeying this, so
if the Sleeper can DT faster than the GM can type their /kill command,
the Slepper wins. :-)

I wonder what loot the Sleeper has?  If I was Verant, I'd figure that
there is no possible loot that would be good enough for the Sleeper,
so not even try.  Instead, the Sleeper would just drop some new chest
armour: "A Lousy T-Shirt".  AC 1.
