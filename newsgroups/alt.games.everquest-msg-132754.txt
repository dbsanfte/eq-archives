Agreed.  In Africa, that's a sufficient part of the population to justify
said character.  In the U.S., it's not.

Showing it on Sesame Street isn't answering the question, it's introducing
the question.  If the child would ask the question on her own, then she
needs to know the answer, or at least a version that she can handle.  If
not, then the need isn't there.  Showing it on Sesame Street is introducing
the need, not answering it.

That's a strawman argument.  EQ never said it shouldn't be discussed if it's
not brought up, only that it shouldn't be brought up at that age.
