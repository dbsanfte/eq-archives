Eventually replace these with Forest Loops, which have same WIS, but 2AC each.

Crystal Covered Shroud is another alternative, but you end up looking like a
fingerwaver.

No AC, but not a lot of alternatives.  I'd prefer a good AC item over a
WIS item with low/no AC here.  I used the cleric quest arms until I made myself
a set of Erollisi Marr Imbued Field Plate Vambraces.

Good choice.  You'll use it a *LONG* time before you get something better.

Then try and trade it off for a Mammoth Hide cloak (or camp it yourself once
you hit 29th), same wis, but 3 more AC.

If you're going for things that require a mid-30s group, just do the Bracers
of the Reverent quest a couple times.
