In addition to the generally fatal Gflux/CoH trick, you can also pull the
first reaver through the locked door with PBAoE spells, them and the Army
Behemoths (or whatever the name is, the only golems that aren't classified
as fog/mist/haze/vapor/etc, and say something in all caps when they agro)
seem to be the only things in zone that are social (in my experience),
besides possibly goos (don't kill goos enough to tell).  Anyways, you have a
suicidal druid/wiz/enc/nec/cleric stand as close to the door as they can,
target themselves and cast their most powerful PBAoE (or it might be rain
spells, I can't remember), this will pull the reaver out, as well as
something like everything else in the room.  So you'd better have
overwhelming force to pull this 'trick' off.

That said, there's been a 60 monk/rogue/cleric team farming reavers lately
while I've been soloing the temple.
