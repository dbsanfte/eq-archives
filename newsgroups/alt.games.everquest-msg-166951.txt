When you sell your blue diamonds off to a vendor, which vendor do you typically
use?  I'm assuming it's the vendor closest to where you port to after having acquired the blue
diamonds. Once I found blue diamonds on a vendor in PoK, and have been searching
the vendors in PoK ever since to get more, since I can buy them for about 265, and
re-sell for about 500 in the bazaar (blue diamond prices have dropped dramatically
on the server I'm on since PoP came out).
