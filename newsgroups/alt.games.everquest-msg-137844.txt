I don't know if they stack, but my guess is that a 5% skill item
just reduces your chance of failure by 5%.

There's an Enchanter Alternate Advancement ability called Jewelcraft
Mastery, or something like that, and the description says it reduces
your chances of failure at jewelcraft combinations by 10%, 25%, and
50%.  So I'm guessing the skill modifying items work the same way.

I'm not sure how that would translate into an increase in your
numerical skill, or even if it would.
