A little copy and paste would have killed you? Probably would have taken 
less time than writing the above.

Sorry DT, I had hoped you would simply copy and paste the relevant bit, 
where you previously explained it. If I missed it the first time it 
didn't seem terribly productive to look through 2-dozen plus posts to 
probably miss it again.

Then again maybe it wasn't really there after all and ducking out now is 
how you dodge the issue.
