See, that the thing - you PC types, and gay movement types etc want
to even redefine crime laws just to be different and noticed.  In a
way, its "selfish", and a giant "diss" to *other* victims of the
same crime.  Murder is murder, no matter what the reason.  So a perp
gets *more* punishment for bashing the head in of a gay person, but 
the same perp does the same to your grandma, and gets different
treatment - some equality there, I tell ya!
