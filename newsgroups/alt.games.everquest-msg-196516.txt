A couple of people have already mentioned it but root is the obvious
one. Stand about halfway in max range and let the rogue drift in and
out, rogue steps in to tank between backstab cycles, then drifts out
to max range when BS cycles. If you keep regen up on both, you might
never have to heal before about 40th lvl <g>. 

I'm not sure if disempower still works all that well since the last
time they played around with disease counter agro but the version you
get in your teens used to be able to hold agro against pretty much
anything. Even in a taunt contest against an SK I could hold my own,
where the last person to cast a spell would always have agro.
