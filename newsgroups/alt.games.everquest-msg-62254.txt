          I had a mage friend who summoned me magic weapons when I
needed them.  (Mages can summon NO RENT magic weapons at level one.)
He had to do it each time we grouped since there's no bank spot to
hold NO RENT items.  I didn't know that I could have dueled someone at
the end of an evening and left the summoned weapons on my corpse for
later recovery.  

          If you want a permanent magic weapon, hang at a druid ring
and ask to buy a velium weapon for 5pp.  It's what an NPC pays.  When
finished hunting for the day, many players TP to a ring, rather than
crossing Velious zones, to sell.  Gnoll hide lariats drop commonly in
Blackburrow and are easy to get at 18; they sell to players for about
10pp.  Langseau quest is doable for a group at 18; langseau sell for
20pp.  These aren't uber weapons, but they are cheap and/or easily
acquired magic weapons.  I picked up a "Leg chopper" ages ago that is
still in my bank.  The damage/delay isn't as good as fine steel or a
velium weapon so most players won't even pay 5pp for it.
