Actually, you don't. That's the thing. I canceled again last night and 
SOE confirmed that I was canceled but I had no email confirmation. Which 
makes the fact that he asked if I had confirmation from the first 
confirmation comical. He told me I should have saved the web page. Now 
that I'm thinking about it, I should have simply copy/pasted my recent 
cancel and change the few relevant fields and then provided that as 
confirmation.

Luckily my CC company refunded the charge with no questions asked so I'm 
a little less hot about it. However, I must say that the guy I talked to 
was nothing but an ass.
