I don't mind beggars as much.  My main is a mage, so I'll usually summon 
a few things for folks.  The summoned weapons, a summoned dimensional 
pocket and maybe some food, water and bandages cost me about three 
minutes and aren't bad 'twink' items for newbies, especially since they 
vanish when the player logs out.

Most real lowbies appreciate the items.  The beggars who are looking for 
loot usually don't.
