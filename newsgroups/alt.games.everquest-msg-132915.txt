I was in the Casters Guild in Freeport yesterday and a guy was begging in
/ooc and /shout.  I was buying some needed spells for a lower lvl enchanter
in my guild and this guy walks up to me and starts telling me how bad his EQ
life has been and how he needs money for his spells.  I ignored him but did
a /who on him.  turns out he was a lvl 19 chanter..and I recalled helping
him out one time before..He had the kind of name you remember.  So I said to
him, " I recall helping you once before and I don't help people more than
once.  Do something to help yourself and stop begging off of people".  He
left the zone at that point.
