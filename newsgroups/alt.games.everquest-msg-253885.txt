Still, that means its a Jolt at level 24, when rangers another chain 
wearing class, don't get such a thing till what, 52?  Admittedly rogues 
have had something along these lines almost since birth (since birth if 
they were halflings) and monks since what, 19?

Is this on the same timer as Leg Chop and Head Strike, the snare and 
stun?  I'm already having trouble in places where I need to stun casters 
but need to snare runners; if needing to dump aggro is on the same clock 
I can see its going to be a struggle.
