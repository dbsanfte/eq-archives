I think it's an interesting story and it goes to show how different people
are affected differently.

Personally, I've returned to EQ after a year away.  I knew from the moment I
decided to return what it would involve and I considered the effects
carefully.  Previous experience of EQ taught me that it absorbs a great deal
of your life.  For example, just today I was given a few hours' leave from
work and have spent them playing EQ.  I chose to spend them that way - my
friends weren't available and I had nothing else to do.

But I have to say - and I don't mean to comment on anyone else here, we're
all different - I've always viewed EQ as a bit of fun and some engrossing
escapeism.  Yes, it swallows up time like a high-power vacuum cleaner.  Yes,
it causes stress and aggravation as much as it bestows the warm glow of
cheerfulness.  And yes, it encourages people to build "cyberspace" (I hate
that word) relationships instead of real ones.

Still, though, I can't help thinking there are worse things I could be
doing.  Cyberspace relationships are better than none at all (although I
still draw the line at cybersex, of course!) - and "none at all" is what I'd
get if I sat playing some single-player game all day long.  And a gamer is a
gamer - this glowing box in front of me which eats my life and screws up my
eyes is still going to get a great deal of my attention whether EQ's
involved or not.  EQ's unhealthy - but it could be worse.  Granted, I think
EQ would be better if more people could be persuaded to roleplay rather than
simply powerlevelling all the time - but that's a gripe I've always had and
which I don't think I'm ever going to see resolved.

But yes, I agree there is a caveat.  It CAN take over your life, if you're
the sort of person who'll let it.  I can tell a cautionary tale of that
kidney myself, having lost two friends at least partially to this game
because it catalysed with their obsessive competitive personalities and it
simply ate their lives away.  But I can't and won't blame the game entirely.
Rather I blame them for the fact that they were unwilling or unable to
maintain a good grip on what's real and what's not.  Most people I know can
do that, and so EQ will never be a "threat" so much as it's a bit of a
habit.  Like the psychotic loners who go out and shoot people after watching
violent films - it's not the film that causes it, but the combination of the
medium and their own personality.

To conclude, I think it all comes down to who you are.  I've watched
people's relationships degenerate because of EQ - but I believe that, if
they hadn't chosen to play, then something else would have come along and
had the same effect, because that's the sort of people they are.  Then
again, I know others (I hope myself included) who, while the game admittedly
becomes something of a minor obsession, never get to the stage where they
can't simply click "camp" when the real world demands their attention.  I'll
spend an unhealthy amount of my free time on EQ, but it is, after all, my
free time.

Stoopid, I wish you all the best with whatever you choose to fill that ex-EQ
time with, and no, I certainly don't think you're a loser.  You've
recognised that your relationship with the game was becoming unhealthy for
you, and you've done the right thing to deal with that.  I think that shows
that, whether you choose to return to the game at a later date or leave it
alone permanently, you're the type of person who CAN retain control over
your own life.  Good on you.
