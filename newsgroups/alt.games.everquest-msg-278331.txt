I concede its "closer to the truth". However, I maintain that EQ1 should 
be quite profitable, and a solid venture running even at 12.95 with 
150,000.

Watching what other mmogs are doing, where they claim they're break even 
points are, where they get desperate, and where they are finally 
actually cancelled ("deemed no longer a viable venture") backs that 
claim up.

Considering that no venture with a 'mere' 150k players is 'hanging on by 
a thread'. The argument that EQ at 400k+ is even close to becoming non-
viable is simply not credible.

Chalk it up to balancing out the universe. :p
