   Cats can be smart.  One of our cats, Bigguy, once stole of piece of chicken from
Lenny's plate when he went up to get a soda.  The cat hid the chicken behind the
curtain, and returned to the spot where he had been before.  Lenny returned, and
found that his 3 piece dinner had magically turned into a two piece dinner.  He knew,
of course, that the cat has a part in this, but it was hard to prove with the thing
sitting there, looking as innocent as is possible for one of the species.  Even
though Bigguy apparently had the concept of "later" down, he still got busted when I
caught him gnawing on this prize, still behind the curtain, two hours later (he
doesn't eat quiet).
   Cats can be dumb.  When we still lived in an apartment, our next door neighbor had
a cat that he didn't treat very well. The cat was fed only sporadically, and beaten
pretty regularly.  We felt sorry for it, and started allowing it come into our
apartment for food and sanctuary (our neighbor couldn't have cared less that we were
doing that).  Soon the cat spent more and more time at our place, and finally stopped
going to our neighbors at all.  So far so good, the cat was showing common sense
there.  But the thing never stumbled onto the idea that our front door would open
faster if he meowed to be let in.  He would sit out there for _sure_ until we opened
the door for whatever reason, never so much as uttering a peep.  Sometimes the local
kids would  knock on our door for him, tell us how long they'd seen him waiting, and
ask if he was stupid or something.  
   I suspect that dogs can also be smart or dumb.
