Would anyone be able to tell me if NPC's kill other NPC's because of faction
issues? At the moment my Halfling druid is folling around in West
Commonlands, and there is this undead dar-elf Kizdean Gix who has killed me
multiple times. However, the last 2 times he has killed me inside the inn
area near the dwarves. As soon as I open the door there he's right there,
ready and waiting.
Now, I believe I con amiable to both the dwarves and the merchants (I know
that one for sure). So how come they don't kill him for me?!?! Would the
Freeport guards do it?
Thanks for any help,
Chaos
