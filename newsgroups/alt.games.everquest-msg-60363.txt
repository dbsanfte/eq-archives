Well, when you first run the program (which first initiates the autoupdate
program to check for updates,) you are then presented with the user login
screen.  Everything up to this point IS the program.  So the very fact
you've gotten this far says you CAN run the program as a non-admin.  (Or to
be more accurate...you have appropriate file permissions to execute the
application.)

I think the problem is either with your video driver or sound driver.  Once
you enter a valid username and password, EQ then initiates the Direct3D
environment and the DirectSound and DirectMusic drivers.  This is where your
computer is failing.  Windows ran into some kind of problem and killed the
application, which brought you back to the desktop.

There's thousands of reasons why this could happen -- it's either a driver
problem, or Windows is confused about something.  But file permissions is
not the issue here.
