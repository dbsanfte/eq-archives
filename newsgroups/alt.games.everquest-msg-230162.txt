This all assumes the worst case scenario.

1. Both 1h skills go up so fast its not worth even worrying about
either.

2. You may *never* see a weapon in a zero skill you want. For rangers,
this is pretty common for both blunts. Therefore any time spent
skilling them up with craptacular weapons is poor use of time.

3. It is most certainly *not* inevitable. And you certainly don't need
to blow off any drops. Once again, someone who doesn't seem to realize
these skills go up *fast*. It took me one four hour session in PoV to
get 1hs, which I had let lag behind, up about 120 points - and for the
vast majority of that time my dps was not all that gimped because
*offense* was maxed.

4. Relatively painlessly is not necessarily accurate either. If you
have to seriously degrade your weapon quality to practice a skill (as
most people do) you are in fact gaining nothing at all - either you
pay time later on your own, or make your group suffer with you now. My
way doesn't make my group suffer with me... but perhaps ymmv.


Just practice weapon skills you have a decent weapon for, folks. Worry
about those skills you don't (today) when you someday have a weapon
worth using. It's a simple matter to raise, and doesn't take very
long, and saves you time and effort if you never get a weapon in that
category anyways. Having done it both ways, I would never waste time
now on weapon skills I may never need. Can always get it later, at
very little pain, on my own time, when I have something in that skill
worth using.
