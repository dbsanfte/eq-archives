The reason for having weapons as instruments is simple.

A number of songs require instruments, such as the ervaj which is a
stackable haste, which you want to play for your group during a big
fight, however, because it requires a brass instrument you dont want
to be the wall flower, you wanna be in there hitting things. Well,
with this you can.  Yes your instrument almost certainly has a better
factor, but, unless you have your epic. This is a very good tool.
