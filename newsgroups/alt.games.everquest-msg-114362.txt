I'm still not convinced that they are such a rare drop because so many of the
giant spiders get killed by the @#!%$@!$#% guards.  I lost count of the number
of giant spider kills stolen by a guard wandering away from the fence - and I
mean waaaaaaaaaaay away, like near the camps.  Verant really needs to do some
KoS radius downsizing on these guards.  As soon as one of my characters gets
high enough to take out the guards, I am going to spend a lot of time there
keeping them in check.  There are two that are the worst, and I'll probably
leave the third alone.  I HATE THEM.  My druid would probably be level 14 by now
if he hadn't had all those kills stolen by the guard Eigon.
As it was, I managed to get all my armor pieces made within a week thanks to
people who didn't need the components and were kind enough to give a shout with
the item name and location.
