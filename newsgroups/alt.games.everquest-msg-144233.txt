When my guild was younger we used to wipe at least once in Fear on break-in
and at least once on isle 2 (imp isle) in Air.   Hate was troublesome
getting a cleric to the safe spot and camp out for the inevitable 45 minute
CR, but after that we just rolled through the first floor without too much
trouble.

Now that's changed.  In Fear the last couple times (first with 18, 2nd with
12) we had a total of 1 death on break in.  In Air last time we had I think
2 deaths on imp isle.  Hate hasn't changed in THAT regard...we can still get
to the SW safe spot.

The trouble we're having is a whole lot of adds including some Deathrot
Knight.  And this is from an experienced Hate puller, so we're not talking
n00b here.

OF THOSE WHO HAVE GONE IN THE LAST 2 MONTHS, has Hate changed recently?  If
so, how have you countered it?  We're going up soon and intend to try the
zone-in break, just to stay away from that damned knight until we're ready
for him, but we aren't really looking forward to it. :p  If it weren't for
the rangers & mages in our guild needing their epic pieces we'd just write
the zone off.

Thanks!
