	Hardly.

	Yes.

	Haste and regen items are hardly typical twink gear.  Yes, I know there
are people who can afford to hang a Fungi on their new Rogue/Monk twink.  They
are the exception, not the rule.

	And with the new policy of level-capping items, I think these days are
coming to an end.

	Which have a marginal effect on newb fighters.

	Casters are ALREADY killing mobs faster and more efficiently than fighters
BEFORE twinking.

	And mine is a Necro -- what is this 'med' of which you speak?
