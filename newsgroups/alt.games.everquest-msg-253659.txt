No no, very very bad idea. War Cry goes in the combat abilities box, which
means it blocks discs. The last thing you want in your MT group is a class
that blocks his/her defensive. It also sucks for the DPS classes, for the
same reason. Duelist, Trueshot, etc, etc, all up the DPS of their respective
classes by far more than War Cry does. I suppose it would be useful for
after all discs are used on longer fights, but that eliminates 99% of PoP
and GoD(since those fights are likely over before all discs are used up). I
suppose it could be useful in Luclin raids with their god awful HP and AC,
but thats about it.
