What you've stated is why (most) Casters can solo easily and why melee
classes, especially the Warrior, can't.
What Kei does is remove so much downtime that when it comes to just gaining
exp even the average solo'ers are better off alone than grouped.

TBH, the OP has gotten to the worst stage in a Warriors "life" 50 - 54, at
this point the only decent zones to hunt in are often BYoG and nearly all
the zones where you can find pick up groups are of a level range where
they'd rather take a 55 to tank better or a high 40's to take less of exp.

I found past 46th was a struggle to get groups and would have actually quit
for DAoC if I hadn't gained a friends account with a low 40's Druid on it.
