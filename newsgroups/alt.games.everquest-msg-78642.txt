Notice that Biz says (Rephrased) "If you can't make 60Kpp a month by
only playing to make pp and by playing a lot of hours every day, then
there is something wrong"

So the question is do you play at least 35 hours a week ("more than a
couple" * "every day") and do you spend all that time only trying to
make money ?

This is probably what the guide will require for you to make 60kpp a
month.

This is all that Biz is saying.
