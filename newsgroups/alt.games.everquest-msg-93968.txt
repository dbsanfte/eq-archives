I'm not sure I would accept a contingincy-fee law firm as proof of the 
invalidity of statistical sampling.  Was Phen-fen the one that caused 
people to get sick because of explosive diarrhea?  I don't want to make

someone because their product causes you to lose some of that shit, and it 
harms you.
