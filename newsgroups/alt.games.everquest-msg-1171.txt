  Ok I consider myself an open minded guy, I don't think guns kill (people
do or little bunny rabbits with big fangs), I don't think the TV is
responsible for the violence in our schools today (it's the TV evangelist
that are) and I don't think listening to Black Sabbath or Megadeth means you
are a devil worshiper (you just have bad hearing by now).
  Last night while on putzing around with my gnome warrior (cute bugger,
wanna group?) I noticed a gnome necro lvl 2 by the name of Lusafir, I think
that is inappropriate for a game name.  Am I being a prude or should I have
let the KewlDOod have his name?  And yes I did report it don't know what
happened.
