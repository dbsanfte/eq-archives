Well it's definitely not 45 minutes.  Like I said, we completed
successfully in 28 minutes and were requesting another one within 30
minutes of entering the instanced zone.  It did not take us 15 minutes
to get there either.

Hmm, I wonder if all the 1 minute here and 1 minute there bits could
add up to 45 if I take into account the time we had to wait after the
first request.  Include the fast, but still a few minutes, travel time
and maybe it is.  I'll have to test that.
