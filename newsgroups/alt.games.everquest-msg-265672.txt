We've established beyond dispute that killstealing exists in CoH. Having 
someone engage the mobs you are fighting and thus reduce the xp you get 
against your will fits under the definition of killstealing. It may not 
be how CoH devs have defined killstealing but that is utterly 
irrelevant. 

As we covered EQ awards xp to the person who does the most damage. As 
long as that person got the xp there was no killsteal. Provided the devs 
simply define killstealing as a situation where the person who does the 
most attributed damage does not get the xp then kill stealing doesn't 
exist in EQ either.

In fact, there is no killstealing in a last damage wins title either, 
becuase in that game the xp is awarded to the person who does damage 
last, and as long as that person gets xp then the system is working as 
intended and there was no killsteal. Because the devs of that game will 
cleverly define killsteals as a situation that arises when the person 
who does the final blow does not get xp.

Kill stealing is implicitly divorced from the mechanics, because kill 
stealling is a player perception of an abuse of the mechanics. CoH is 
the same. If I engage 4 mobs, and you kill one of them, I absorbed its 
damage, I tanked it, I survived it while i killed its buddies, and then 
you took the xp for the boss, which I tanked for you, and I got nothing 
of its xp for my trouble. Sounds like an abuse of the mechanics, sounds 
like a killsteal.

We've also established that killstealing is against the rules, and that 
if someone is doing it to you, you can petition it for harassement.

A rose by any other name.

And there is the crux of it. KDragon reported Killstealing, which is a 
form of harrassment. CS told him there was no such thing as killstealing 
and closed his incident. Obviously CS needs to be savvy to the fact that 
people playing their game will be coming from previous MMOGs, each of 
which had different mechanics, be it EQ where you have to the 'most' 
damage, or a title where you have to do the last damage, or whatever. In 
each game, there is a form of harrassment where players will bother you 
by killing mobs that you are engaged with. Typically its called 
killstealing.

If someone reports killstealing in CoH the appropriate CS response is to 
presume that someone has just had the mobs he was engaged with killed by 
another player. They should take the initiative to establish whether or 
not its a case of harrasement instead of dismissing it out of hand as 
something KDragon must be imagining.

Is CoH really a game were it routinely happens that people just follow 
eachother around killing stuff without any communication. If so, it 
sounds miserable. If not, your grasping at straws.

PS I quite like the new 'sparky' nickname you've come up with for me and 
seen fit to use a few times now. Its really clever. If you like I can 
come up with one for you... how about 'Dim'? It's sort in the same 
theme, and I think the connotation is suitable ;)
