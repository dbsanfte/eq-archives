By the 4th or 5th non-rpk they gank the gaurd points will have dried up 
and they'll be rpk again themselves...and all the gaurd advantages 
they've earned will have been stripped.

No. Greifers will get little to no success trying to manipulate that. 
Plus the gaurd abilities and items will only be 'extra effective' when 
fighting people marked rpks. The bandit bane weapon won't do extra, they 
won't be able to track other gaurds, etc etc etc...

Plus...the only people the greifers will get an edge greifing will be on 
other greifers... and hey if the greifers are feeding on eachother... I 
can live with that :)

Certainly ideally you'd want GMs all over the place doing interesting 
things. EQ promised it but failed utterly to deliver. EQ Legends 
promised it again, and by most accounts failed largely to deliver.

But while that's an ideal, an automated system could do a handy job at 
resolving many of the problems.

But failure is gauranteed. An RvR game with one R is a failure by 
definition, I'd think, particularly for the 'new player' joining that 
world... how can anyone enjoy joining the losing team during the mop up 
stage?

My best (and partial) solution to RvR is periodic reset. The games will 
run to 1 year and then end, with the victors declared, and then the war 
starts over....
