"The problem with skiing is gravity. Huge amounts of it. Ski areas are 
located smack dab on top of giant gravity piles called 'mountains.' Most 
areas also use machines to make more gravity at night. Thus powerful 
forces are always trying to suck you down the mountain and into large 
fixed objects such as buildings."
Dave Barry
