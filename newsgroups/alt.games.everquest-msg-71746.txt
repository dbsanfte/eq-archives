One of my friends is very enthusiastic about DAoC (maybe not as much as he
was in EQ but enthusiastic just the same) and he has no intention of doing
RvR (!?!) This, imo, was the biggest selling point of the game, decent PvP,
it sounded great and when I think about it now, it still sounds great.
The problem I had/have is that I still enjoy EQ and the PvE side of DAoC did
not capture my imagination as much, so I never got to experience RvR, maybe
one day I will, when EQ no longer holds any interest to me.
DAoC is a very good, well thought out game, the graphics engine runs nicely,
even on lower spec machines, there is just something missing that EQ still
holds for most of us, that's why the subscriptions were not taken up.
