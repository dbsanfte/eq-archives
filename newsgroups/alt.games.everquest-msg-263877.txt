So far, at least, my worst experience with usenet stalking tops out at 
having some twit post pages of pointless inflammatory drivel in response 
to any and every post I make, on any group they can find me.

I guess when I've been stalked on usenet I don't have trouble sleeping 
at night. I'm not paranoid about whether my doors are locked. I find it 
humourous in hindsight, and at most annoying in the present.

That said, I would prefer not to have some debate on the nature of soul, 
the existence of god, the idiocy of the US president, the relative 
merits of dvd+r vs dvd-r or any other hot-button question explode into 
many of the groups I particpate in on a professional level, or even into 
eachother, as is the case with a.g.e for example.

So:

I view stalkers as an annoyance like trolls. I take steps to avoid them 
disrupting my life outside the context of a single usenet group... but 
I'm not afraid of them, and on some level I find them humourous. (Again 
rather like trolls). I don't really think that's nearly so inconsistent 
as you appear to suggest.
