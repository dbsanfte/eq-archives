My friend and I started a duo a Darkelf SK and a Darkelf Cleric.  We
just got lvl 9 last night in befallen and are planning on going to
kurns tower tonight.  My question is neither of us have ever really
explored everquest, specifically dungeons. So I am wondering if you or
anyone or anywhere there might be a list of places to check out and
what lvl.  I was thinking we could stay in kurns till around lvl 17 or
so, then maybe hit up paludal for a few lvls maybe 24 or so.  So where
would you reccomend then, maybe splitpaw or crystal caverns or
somthing else fun?  I dont want to miss out on any fun zones, the ides
is not to level fast but to enjoy ourselves and just have a good time.

On a side note, man Befallen was really difficult last night, what a
tough dungeon. Hopefully it will get easier for us to group once we
get a few more levels.

Thanks so much

Halve
