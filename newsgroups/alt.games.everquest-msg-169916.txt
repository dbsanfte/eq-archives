i felt the same way and took it as a challenge. the use of CH went down and
supernal elixier became my friend. 2k hp over time with way less agro and
more time to concentrate on healing other groupmembers on adds etc. running
mobs around, rooting, stunning as additional CC.
its fun )))))
chanter have their own way to come throught this new agro by use of the new
rune and boggle.
/sigh and now it gets fixed? oh well :p
