Actually if you are a druid or ranger they won't, in fact they may
help. People do have to be careful as non rangers or druids sitting at
rings who then get attacked by a passing bear (especially in north
karana)

My druid was charming bears to kill other bears for hides on that
druid mountain in Mountain rathe. If one of the preservers or the
higher level people saw me, they came and killed the bear I was trying
to kill because it was beating on me and my pet. That is how much they
like me ;) I've also killed all manner of critters around the NK and
WC ring as a druid.. they don't care.

Holly windstalker, around qeynos hills, appears to be the only npc who
will still kill a druid or ranger for beating on animals.
