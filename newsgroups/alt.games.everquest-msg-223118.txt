..in 6 hours of camping.

The OOT camp was not so bad - quick enough respawn not to be totally boring
but a set timer so after a kill could stop paying attention, get a beer,
take a wizz etc.

I am not sure if 6 hours in good or not but it was comfortable which was the
main thing. I could not imagine running all over SRo killing everything that
moves for a similar time frame : /
