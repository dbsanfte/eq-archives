Hi Again

Humm!

I should have realised it was more of a hangover than brain wave. But I 
can see that there are a few things that could come out of it.

I like 42's idea of making some of the low level 'dungeons' into a 
variation of an instant dungeon.

Perhaps it could be possible to split Crushbone, Befallen, The Warrens 
into say 3 varieties.

If your 1 to 15 you get the present variety of Crushbone, etc. If your 
16 to 30 you get the upgraded variety and if your 30+ you get the last 
variety.

It would help stop power levellers as they couldn't enter with their 
'client'

As well as layering some of the dungeons

Perhaps put in more areas of the Dungeon only high level characters 
could get to because of a say:

1) A powerful ward that only a high level mage could dispel or negate.

2) A door that needs a  very good pick lock skill.

3) A Guard creature that is impossible to kill but could be neutralised 
for a short time by the right potion fed to it or spell cast on it.

Thanks Dark Tyger, Carl Procter, Bat Child, Tracey and all

I must admit I thought farmers just sold all they got for platinum. I 
also totally forgot entirely about faction raising. Though I have 
arrived in The Warrens to find it full of dead bodies before now. But 
the guy doing it was nice enough to say anyone else could loot the 
bodies, so it wasn't a totally wasted journey.

Humm! Instant Dungeon as per Crushbone. Then the 'factioner' would be 
getting experience and faction again. It would also make the trip to 
stonebrunt more entertaining. Perhaps boost porting sales by Druids and 
Wizards?

Perhaps Merchants in zones only accessible by high level characters 
selling 'No Drop' versions of the trade items might help if the negative 
experience idea was introduced.

Though I don't know how that would impact on the bazaar as I rarely go 
there as the lag is just to much. Also I cannot see the fun in standing 
there for hours on end trying to sell things (I know people leave 
characters up over night. But my system doesn't seem to be stable 
enough. Tried twice, both times crashed after approx. an hour, 
considering I have played for 8 hours in one session. I put it down to 
the bazaar at fault)

Thanks Tim Smith

Humm! hadn't thought of being attacked while resting AFK.

Perhaps if the NPC starts the fight the character doesn't get the 
negative experience hit. But the body still disappears?

Anyway thanks for the feedback.
