The real VS lifetap is MUCH bigger than VSR, you *NEED* chain runes on MT to
pull it off, or he'll just eat your tanks for lunch and say "yummy, oh,
wait, you were trying to hurt me?  oops, guess I shouldn'tve taken your
health"

There's a safe hall outside VS/VSR's room that the ranger/druids camp him
from also.

would post more but just realized I'm late
