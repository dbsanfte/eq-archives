    And that assumption would be wrong. ;-)

    XP=ZEMx(group_bonus)x[(level_bonus)^2]x(high_level_differential_bonus)

    XP is then further modified based on number of party members, raid
versus non-raid, class, and AA versus non-AA (as an offshoot of class
changes).

    Actually, E=mc^2 defines Mass. My post-grad work in relativity finally
got used for something, wheee!

    If you understand the concept well enough, you know what the formula is
or at least know the proportionality. He knew neither.

    I'd make the same assumption, if he hadn't further posted to confirm
what he didn't know.

    Nope. Most of the fun is in the chase, not the catch.

    You should Google me, then. You might be surprised how much information
I've cheerfully churned out over the years of posting here. If nothing else,
I told you exactly what a ZEM is!

    There once was a Barbie doll that said, "Math is hard!" But it was a
hunk of plastic, so it could be excused a little math phobia. What is your
excuse?
