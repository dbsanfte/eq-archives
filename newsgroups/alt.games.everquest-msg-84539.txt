Yeah, I agree.  And, the funny thing is, that with SoL
taking THREE CD-ROM's to "upgrade" your EQ set-up, the
"new" sounds sound like they were recorded by holding
a microphone in front of a speaker!!!  The "new" sounds
are FAR worse than the "old" sounds (EQ/Kunark/Velious).

Again, I agree.  I have a fairly new system that EASILY
meets the "recommended" SoL requirements (and is no slouch
on its own):

1.4 GHz Athlon
1 Gig DDR RAM
Geforce3 Ti200 (OC'ed)
Maxtor D740 drive on UDMA100

When I'm running EQ (with SoL installed) but still in the
"old world", my CPU is PEGGED!  Remember, this is with ALL
of the new models disabled.  See this for proof:

http://home.attbi.com/~miketemp1/EQ_performance.jpg

This is basically just crappy performance from something
that really doesn't warrant needing that much CPU -- I mean,
for example: Unreal Tournament's graphics are far superior,
much faster, more detailed, etc. and it ran just fine on
my old Celeron 466 with Geforce256 (1st generation) card.

Thanks for the advice.  I might cruise up there sometime
just to see what it looks like like.  If the new character
models cause crappy framerates on my machine in the "old
world", I can only imagine what and entire city based on
"new models" would do! :^(
