This is such a guy thing.  The constant barrage of the *f* word.  Can we try to
see how many different ways it could be used in a sentence?  Like:

You are a f'ing liar so why don't you go f your poodle you stupid f.

See, in that case it's an adjective, a verb, and a noun.  All in the same
sentence!  

I play with a couple of people who use *wtf* every couple of minutes. 
Overpull?  WTF?  No KEI?  WTF :(  Killsteal?  WTF????    Can't get that buff to
stick?  WTF?  Can't afford a sword?  WTF!  
I sometimes wonder if they have it hotkeyed....
