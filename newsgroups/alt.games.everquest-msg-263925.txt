No, and no plans to add one.

Quoting Gallenite (Scott Hartsman, producer) on the beta boards:

"EQ2 won't be getting "Quest Sharing" in the sense of people assigning
others their quests any time in the near future.

As one of EQ2's core aspects is about accomplishment, people will
still need to get quests themselves in order to be rewarded from them.
In some cases, being able to be issued the quest is part of what
you're accomplishing.

We are working on ways for people to be able to share in the updates
of their groupmates and see who has which quests in common, if you
choose.

As far as it working in WoW?  If it works for them?  Cool!  I think
it's safe to say, though, that not every idea from either game would
really translate well into the other. :)"
