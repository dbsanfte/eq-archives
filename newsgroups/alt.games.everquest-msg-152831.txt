There is something about religion that tends to draw all sorts of nutcases
out from under rocks. My mother attends the same University I work at. She
is studying Sanskrit, Asian Studies as well as Bhuddism. Every semester she
has studied in the religous studies department it starts off with about a
third of the students who have enrolled having done so because they are
Rabid Christian Nutcases who try to disrupt any studies of other religions,
standing up and yelling at how there is only one true god, how Bhuddism is
demonic and the usual spittle flinging rhetoric.

Once one get's asked to leave because of disruption, they try to waste as
much time as possible and of course there is delay in security arriving
in-situ. With one lecture successfully disrupted with the loss of one
nutcase, the next lecture will be another ones turns, they organise it
amongst themselves I suspect to achieve maximum disruption. It works, the
first month of any semester is a complete right-off workload wise.

Sometimes I suspect Monotheism has been the single biggest humanitarian "bad
idea" disaster in human history.... it seems to breed intolerant fanatics at
an alarming rate. BTW - I am not Pagan or anything else, I guess I am one of
those people who just don't care for the entire concept of religion at all.
