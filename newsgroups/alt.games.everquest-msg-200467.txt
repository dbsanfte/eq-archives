Making the duration level dependant would be hell on raids. This is a
point I missed when I suggested reducing the duration in order to curb
people leaving the group to go get KEI refreshed.

How about making the effect level dependant? Something like level / 5
mana regen? Or 5 + (level - 50) or something? With minimum and maximum
values.
