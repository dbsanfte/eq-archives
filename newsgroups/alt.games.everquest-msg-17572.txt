There's this cool little line in the header of every reply that says
References: <messageid@some.news.server.com>  For example, this message will
have References: <CPSZ6.23972$ID1.6739817@typhoon.nyroc.rr.com>, indicating
that it is a reply to your post, even if I changed the subject line.
Newsreaders that don't qualify as ancient history will recognize this and
properly thread it :)
