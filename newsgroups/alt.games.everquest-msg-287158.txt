Played for a while last night, and there were at least two different
characters being used to spam all public chat channels with plat
seller/powerlevelling ads in a constant stream, one after the other -
no exaggeration. All I could do was put the characters on /ignore.

I have never seen it that bad before. It was beyond ridiculous. Yay
