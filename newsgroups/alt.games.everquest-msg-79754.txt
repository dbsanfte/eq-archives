    So one warrior with defensive, one cleric, and the six other people you
didn't bother to mention at first. :-)

    That's too bad. That time could have been spent more productively, I
imagine. You likely hurt your guild by spending so much time on something
that could have been done faster.

    Too bad it was spent so poorly. You have shown determination, though.

    As for "quick to judge", well, have you asked any of those other people
who did the quest if they camped everything? How many of them do you suppose
bought droppable components (the head from SK/the headband/etc.) or bought
MQs of parts? Did you ask the poster if his guild could afford to have one
of their monks off farting around killing greens when the end result could
be obtained much faster another way? My Iksar monk has done all his shackles
up to Bronze, too (did you do Steel yet? Imagine so), and given that now
there's a tailored wrist that's superior to Bronze I don't plan to do it a
second time so I can have Bronze/Steel. Am I a gimp for not self-nerfing?

    And sitting in one place, killing the same green PH over and over, is
not entertainment to a lot of folks. I'm one of them. I'm glad there are
people who do enjoy that sort of thing - farmers provide some needed items
to the marketplace. But don't expect me to be one, and don't expect me to be
thrilled when you call me a "gimp" for not wasting my time taking the long
route to a goal.

    I felt upset when I saw how much faster folks could level up in outdoor
Kunark zones than I had at the same level, allowing them to get to the parts
of the game that interested them all the faster. Then I realized how petty
it was to be that jealous and got over it.
