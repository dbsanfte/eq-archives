Routing's more of a problem than pure distance...

Anyone else remember about 2 years ago... a router (in Austin, TX I think)
went haywire and started hijacking packets and redirecting them? Shut most
of the East Coast and Europe off from accessing pretty much anything on West
Coast, not just EQ servers.

... but neither adds significantly to latency compared to the usual
suspects... your own ISP or local TelCo (especially over dial-up/copper wire
in the local loop)

UK to Prexus (San Diego) over dial-up (ISP #1)... ping avg 500-800 (billed
by the minute... 2hour max connection... and that was the BEST you could get
in UK back then!)
UK to Prexus (San Diego) over dial-up (ISP #2)... ping avg 300-500 (flat
rate, but still 2 hour max connection)
UK to Ant Bayle (UK) over dial-up (ISP #2)... ping avg 200-300
UK to Ant Bayle (UK) over 128k Cable... ping avg 80-100 (flat rate,
always-on... and package with Digi-TV and phone works out cheaper than ISP
#2 + phone + terrestrial Digi TV!!)
