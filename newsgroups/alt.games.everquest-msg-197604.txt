Right.  The affect is pretty obvious if you are reasonably systematic about
how you resupply yourself for food and water, so any change in consumption
shows up next time you resupply.  I sometimes wonder how anyone can miss
this.

My guess is that because a lot of mobs in Oasis drop water, some people get
enough water from the mobs to compensate, and so don't notice the increased
consumption.
