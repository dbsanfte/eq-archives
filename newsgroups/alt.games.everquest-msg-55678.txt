> Yes you can fart or belch but it is still considered rude to do it. =)

  Last time I checked, looking at a person wasn't rude.  And I dismiss the
argument that inspecting a person is the equivalent of looking at the tags
of their clothing.  You can inspect somebody from a good distance away from
them, and you can't tell anything more about their gear than you'd be able
to at a glance... I don't need to be two inches away from a person to tell
their breastplate is made out of a brown chitin, or to tell they're wearing
an emerald ring.

  Verant has not changed its policy on this.  They have obviously considered
the arguments of all sides, however, since they recently implemented the
option to turn off inspection notices for those people who are for some
absurd reason, offended by it.

  Let's put it this way: Who cares if a tree falls in the forest?  As long
as it doesn't fall on your house, I fail to see what the problem is.
