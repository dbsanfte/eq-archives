Male half elves, MAYBE. The only times a female half elf can come
anywhere near outshining me is when bugs run off with my hair and the
backside of my skull. Male wood elves look better if they can dress in
something other than leather, and female humans look plain BAD in
plain leather tunics (ulthork is much nicer on them) Male human druids
aren't too bad, if they can avoid the crystal covered shroud.
