I have been playing exclusively with new models since Luclin release, and 
recently have been switching back to old models for raids.  Having lived 
with the new models for so long, all of the old models look absolutely 
awful.  They are all sharp edges, and flat faces.  I would love to see 
them use some of the old models as the basis for new models, but, as it 
stands right now, I refuse to use old models unless I absolutely have to.
