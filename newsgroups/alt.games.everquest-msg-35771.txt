Closest I've come to camping is with a warrior, sitting and healing waiting
on the mob to respawn for another kill while reading this news group on
another computer (and having volume up so I only look back at the screen
when I hear the mob back again).  I wouldn't consider that camping though.
More like being distracted.

Would it still be considered revenge if he killed my Halfling Druid and I
came back after him with my Barbarian Warrior (he kills little wimp, I smack
his @ss with big basher)?
