Humans have no meaningful advantages in-game, for which they are
rewarded with near blindness at night.  The only race that's as
"bad" as Humans is Half Elves, who get infravision in exchange
for having outright crappy stats for every class they're allowed
to play except for Rogue:  -15wis, -5str, -5sta, +15agi, +10dex.
Half Elves used to have the sharpest looking plate armor, but they
fixed that with the Luclin models and the grotesque penis helm.
Humans got better looking armor with Luclin, but they still can't
see in the dark.
