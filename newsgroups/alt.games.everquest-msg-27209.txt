You do have a very good point... upon looking back at my original
comments, I realize they were insulting... I apologize and have
apologized several times for that.  Beyond the original comments, I
don't think I'm raving like a lunatic, nor do my arguments resemble
those of a lunatic.  I agree with your rhetoric: chances are, on a
purely first hand basis, it's unlikely that any of this will directly
help my friends (lord knows, they only look at the a computer for one
reason)... but I believe they is something to gain out of it... the
insights (or barbs perhaps) I have received have given me another
perspective... my whole experience with EQ (friends, seconds of
gameplay experience etc) has been nothing but an entirely negative
one... imagine being invited to a friends house and then being ignored
in favour of the "game" (and I say "No" to any potential bitter
respondent saying "They ignore you because your a horrible person"). 
That type of stuff tends to colour one viewpoint on anything... but
many of your comments have humanized the gamers, and the fact that
many of you (is that true?) can moderate I find heartening.  I guess
that explains my presence here... but truthfully, heated argument does
waken the senses, does it not?
