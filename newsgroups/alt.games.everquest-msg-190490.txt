    Automated plat deletions? That's a good one. "Why did all the plat on
our guild bank mule just go poof?" "I gave 10 K to a friend that just
started, and it was deleted. Why?" And so on. This would cause more
headaches than it would solve.

    HAHAHAHAHA! "Clearly lying"? Yeah, that won't cause problems. Do you
remember the good old days, when one person going to a message board could
cause oodles of problems for SOE when they overstepped? The only reason that
doesn't happen much now is because SOE stopped trying to enforce the rules
strictly, and only goes after the obvious problems.
