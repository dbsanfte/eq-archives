     That's absolutely right.  We should neither get richer than anyone
else, or get less after expenses are computed.

    On the adventure I was on last night, Lenny was the master looter,
and as the person with the highest cha, I ended up selling the vendor
loot.  I had burned through 6 dots, including ones for myself and
Lenny.  I held on to four plat (why should the group pay for Lenny's and
mine when they were paying for their own?) and did a split on what
remained.  I told the group exactly what I was doing, and why.  The
general response was "Oh, cool.  Ok."

    That other cleric ripped off the group.  If you ever group with him
again (and I personally would have reservations about doing so.  I
dislike thieves.)  I would make sure that he understand the the above
concept.
