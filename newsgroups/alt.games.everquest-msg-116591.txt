Fascinating.  When I follow either link I see neither quiver nor bow.

Speculation:
I wonder if he didn't recycle an old ranger image and overlay it with
the cabbage and the cabbage's text bubble while hiding the bow/quiver?
This might cause the image to appear differently to us depending on
browser and browser settings (my browser is Netscape 6.2, fwiw).
