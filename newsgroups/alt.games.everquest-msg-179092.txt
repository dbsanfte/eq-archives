A lot of people had login/password problems.  For some of them, going to 
The Station and changing the password there fixed it.  For others, going 
into EQ and changing your password there fixed it.

Mine was ( is ) a weird case.  The password I used for EQ just refused to 
work for EQIM.  If I changed 1 character, it worked.  If I changed it back, 
it didn't.  Even if I changed my Station password to match, it made no 
difference - the password I prefer to use for EQ just doesn't work with 
EQIM in anyway, no matter what.  I finally gave in and now I just use a 
different password on EQ than what I want.

Tech support can't explain it and have no idea what is causing it, and I 
really don't care anymore.  I can use EQIM and that's what matters, even if 
it is buggy and clears out my buddy list now and then.
