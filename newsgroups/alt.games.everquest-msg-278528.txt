	I've thought about this and I have to say I couldn't disagree
more.  I've always found it completely frustrating not to mention more
than a little silly that a master thief can't sneak into the castle,
assasinate the boss, and steal the loot and instead needs to find a 
healer, a slower, a tank, and then hang around waiting to attack the
monsters from behind.  Why can't I build a character like Aragorn (yes, I 
know LOTR references are hackneyed :-) ?  Why can't I roam the wilds defending
the small folk from evil?  (Well, I can, of course, I just won't get
any XP from it.)  If my friends want me they can leave a note at the inn :-)

	Besides the fact that forcing cookie cutter groups on the 
players flys in the face of the roleplaying aspect, there are many 
more problems with the whole grouping thing than just LFG for an hour
before you can play.  For one thing, there's the problem of finding a
*useful* group.  How many times has this happened to you?

	You LFG for 45 minutes.  You get an invite and show up only to
find that there are still 3 slots open.  20 minutes later you're full,
but the cleric needs to go find KEI and the monk needs to go to the bank.
After another 10 or 15 you get the mission or adventure or whatever.  At
least one person dies on the way to the entrance because invis dropped, or
a named was up, or they just went the wrong way.  Inside, you wipe on 
the third pull because someone breaks mezz.  After CR and rezzes the tank
announces that she's sorry but the guild needs her for a raid so the
group breaks up leaving you with _almost_ as much XP as when you started 
2.5 hours ago.

	I know that's more or less part of the game but sometimes I don't
feel like bothering and would ***LOVE*** a useful, immersive solo
experience.  "Only a daring and expert thief could sneak into the Goblin
King's chamber and steal the Red Jewel"  "Only a wizard can enter the
Sanctum of the Bright Flame.  You will need to go alone on this journey."
I mean, why the hell not?

	And I believe that it's also a mistake to say a solo player
is diminishing his own experience never mind the collective experience.
Many's the time when I've been soloing somewhere, come across another
adventurer, formed a temporary duo, and then each gone our own way until
the next time.  Or been soloing (well, farming greens for tradeskills or
whatever) and come across another player or even a whole group in trouble
and been able to help out.  Or just been able to offer buffs and rezzes.
One of my earliest EQ memories is hunting bats and bugs in Butcherblock when
I came across a player locked in combat with one of the wandering Greenbloods.
He was very much getting the worst of it but even my tiny heals turned the
tide and the monster turned, climbed to the top of a tree, and died well
out of our reach :-)

	Friends?  Well, I make plenty of in-game friends this way.  And ya
know something?  I'm not AFTER real-life friends from EQ.  It's an escape!
I want to GET AWAY from the demands of real life :-)
