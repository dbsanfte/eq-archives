Using your argument (I won't call it reasoning because it is FAR from
reasonable), it is perfectly justifed and understandable for Japanese
to enter your home and butcher your family, even though (most likely)
they were not even alive in 1945. (that rhymes and you know it!!)

Do you agree with that??
