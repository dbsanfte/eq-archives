Every newsreader I have seen (and I review software for my company on a regular
basis) does so by default, but they are all also configurable, and users can
accidentaly do so accidentlly (far too easily especially in Netscape). In addition
threads can be lost as old posts are excluded by the reader or the ISP.

The fact is, that it is more important both to Americans [sic] because it happened
in America [sic] (as it would be more important to Australians if it happened in
Australia, or Venezuelans if it happened in Venezuela, tragedy is always viewed in a
different lgiht when it is closer to home), *and* because it is on, as you said, a
scale much larger than anything preceding it...
