  And more, alot more, snipped because Dick doesn't know how to do that
very well yet.

  As I read your posts, Dick, it seems to me that you just simply didn't
like EQII very much.  Fair enough.  I hated The Sims Online even though
there were several posters in the official forums that seemed to like it. 
There's nothing at all wrong about not liking a game, and expressing that
dislike on an open forum where it is at least somewhat on topic.

   However, you seem to be crossing the line into trying to convince others
that just because you didn't like it, no one will or should.  Um... it
doesn't work that way, sorry.  The things you hate are things that someone
else is going to look at and say "Oh, cool!".  This doesn't make them
wrong.  It just means they have a different view of fun than you do.

   Many, many people, myself included, are going to try EQII no matter how
much you try to convince that the game is so horrible that we shouldn't
even bother.  Really, it doesn't matter what you do or say.  This game has
enough of a curiosity factor that many people are simply going to try it no
matter what anyone says about it.  

   You don't like it.  Fine.  We get it.  Now it might be time to move
along.
