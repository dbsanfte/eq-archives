Hello,

I am returning to EQ as a casual gamer after a year break. I've
decided to play a necro since I will only play a few hours a week and
may have to solo most of the time.

I'm sure this has been discussed before but...

Am I better off with a human necro so that I don't have an experience
penalty, or with an eurudite for their high intelligence and
subsequent mana.

If I can kill things with a human sized mana pool, then great, less
sitting to fill the tank! Your experience and comments are
appreciated.

Thanks,
LF
