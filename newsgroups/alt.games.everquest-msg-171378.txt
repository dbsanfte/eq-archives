Our group in Paludal was doing the Phlargs (spelling?) since they were the only
critters not camped by 400 people, (picture your neighborhood mall at
Christmas).  We were mage, mage pet, cleric, ranger.
The ranger kept getting diseased.  We found the solution: Ranger pulled with
snare or arrow,  Mage pet does the tanking, mage casts spells, healer (me)
healed and buffed.  Ranger got free summoned arrows from mage and had a BALL
getting his bow skill up.  When I caught aggro, (rarely) or there were adds the
ranger tanked.  Worked out great for us.
