Also, don't forget to turn on "Run" mode.  When you
first start the game the default is to "Walk", which
is *really* slow.

Check the button that says "Walk" or "Run".  Note
that it's a bit misleading -- if it says "Walk",
you're running, if it says "Run", you're walking.
This is because the button shows which mode you'll
switch *to* if you punch the button.  Hit it until
it says "Walk", and then leave it there.
