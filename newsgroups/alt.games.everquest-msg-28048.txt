One of the things I like about Asheron's Call is that you have that
flexibility.  The choice of individual facial features, skin tone, etc,
means that you can have an Aluvian (caucasian) character who looks like he's
half Sho (oriental), and so on.  On the other hand, it's like being limited
to EQ's three human subraces..
