But there is no point in rushing there. You can be in a level
appropriate group at level 52 and have great fun and rewards. Again,
what is the point of rushing to 60?

As to the second part of your paragraph about XP, more 60's now are
crazy about XP than people much lower.. they get AA points 24/7,
ahaha.

I agree now with AA points, but there is no reason to "rush" there.
I'm currently enjoying 56 very much as a druid and I enjoyed 55 also.
I'm on about 2 aa points earned now (was 55 when luclin came out) I
might be 60 in a year, I just see no reason to rush there.
