Rogue, 35... Baking 28, Brewing 46, Fletching 100, Make Poison 30 (talk 
about farming :p - especially when I insist on making all my own 
containers :)), Pottery 142 (see make poison ;)), Tailoring 40.  I think 
I'm trying to kill myself.

> cost so far, including insane gear upgrades... 45-50kpp

Yeah, I've been looking at gear upgrades myself.  I'd be upgrading INT 
since it's higher than WIS.  But I dunno how many more points I'd need 
to make it more worth it than it already is.  So the only purchase I've 
made so far was a ravenscale coif, which was an upgrade AC-wise anyway, 
and has INT+5 or so.

I've bought all mine.  I gave up when I realized my tailoring had sat at 
28 for months because I just couldn't face the thought of farming greens 
anymore :)  It's gotten a bit better now that I've discovered that, 
while I don't find the spider silk drop rates all that hot in EK, the 
pelt drops (non-ruined that is) are fantastic.  So by killing both 
spiders and whatever 4-legged critters I come across, I get to work on 
tailoring *and* pottery *and* make poison.

See, I use tradeskills as a way of relieving the tedium of levelling.  I 
just can't stand the sit, wait for pull, stand up, kill, sit, rinse, 
repeat.  It drives me nuts.  I've also found the levelling hideously 
slow lately.  OT it seems like everything is dark blue now.  I tried DSP 
and although more *is* available, the groups I get into still pull 
mostly dark blues.  :/  I really need to pull out my maps and figure out 
the safest way to hit Velious.  Them I can start learning the joys of 
thurgadin gate potions ^_^

Ryou
