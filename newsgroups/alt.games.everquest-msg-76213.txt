Generally, in your main hand you want a fast weapon so that you add your
damage bonus more frequently.  In your secondary you want the weapon with
the best damage to delay ratio, speed is immaterial, the primary and
secondary delays time independently.  There is no truth to there being a
check on the secondary only when the primary swings.  Your level will
significantly impact your choice of what weapon to use in what hand, as you
level higher, you will benefit more from a fast weapon in the primary hand.
