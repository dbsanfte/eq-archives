Trouble is, I think you are thinking from the perspective of someone 
who's coming 'back' from Luclin/PoP/GoD raids.

If you are at the point that these former raid encounters are solid gear 
upgrade paths... are you in a position to sub-group them?

If you raid PoP for months so you can 2.5 man tormax, you didn't avoid 
needing to raid... you just raided elsewhere. And my assertion that 
taking all these 'former' raid encounters will require well travelled 
raider still stands.

Of course, you could hang out with elemental groupmates, who have all 
been there done that, who hold your hand through the whole thing by 
providing buffs to the tactics, and never do any raiding yourself... but 
then *you* aren't really taking Tormax, they are.
