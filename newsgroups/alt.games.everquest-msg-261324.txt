Hey kid, come here, first hit's always free/cheap... (says the 
enchanter... in game joke)
Might want to dig around on eqlive.station.sony.com, seems someone is 
always sponsering a free downloadable basic only for 2 weeks or somthing 
account. If you have the bandwidth to do this painlessly it would be 
even cheaper to try it out.

Noone can steal from you directly. Peoplein your group can ninjaloot 
you, or people can loot stuff off things you kill if you leave it laying 
around long enough. Noone else can loot your corpse however. People can 
also do various malicious things such as leading trains of mobs over you.

EQ's storyline is not strong, like an interactive movie, but there is a 
lot of 'stuff' in the game. There is conciderable risk, compared to it's 
competition. You die, you lose about 10% of your xp needed to advance 
through the level before your current one, once you pass level 5 (and 
can de-level).  Once you pass level 10 your body and all it's stuff 
stays where you die. If it rots, (stays 24 hours or 7 days if you are 
offline)  you can go to a special zone and reclaim it there. There are 
also spells for locating/summoning corpses.

There will be lots of things to kill, EQ is vast. But it is, at the 
core, a leveling treadmill... mind you, the 'monster or two' single 
player rpg's I'm not all that familier with. Most single player rpg's 
are 80% mindless monster grinds beyond anything EQ ever did... (Diablo 
2, needing to level up 60-70 levels to beat bosses in Final Fantasy type 
console rpg games, etc. Baldur's gate. Neverwinter nights.)

A good group can setup a continuous stream without much downtime. Solo, 
you generally have to pause to regen mana or health, or both. The 
downtimes are not as extreme as they once were (though mana for most 
classes is still pretty poor without some spells that help out), but you 
are not going to solo even cons one after the other beyond the first few 
levels.

EQ is much more solo friendly than it used to be. That being said, the 
game is built around group dynamics. There are classes, such as druids, 
necromancers, bards, that are renowed for their solo capabilities. I 
couldn't say what the worst soloers are these days... rogues maybe? 
Perhaps cleric... The recent regen changes make soloing melee's much 
more palatable from what I understand.

Outside of a 3-5 level gap , generally not. A suggestion, what we call 
in FFXI a 'static party'. Get a group together... you don't xp except 
with each other. If someone wants to solo, they make an alt. (Final 
Fantasy we change jobs, which is the same basic thing, just without 
another character).

Tactics in EQ are primarily how to properly apply your abilities to a 
fight, rather than tactics of position. This is to compensate for the 
fact that AI's are just plain dumb, and while the average player may not 
be einstein, he can read sites that tell him how to get up on walls and 
stuff.

Much less hectic. Bards can zip along pretty quick mind you, but it's 
still much less concentrated action than say, Doom3.
They do have an online shooter type game though if you are interested, 
Planetside.

There is a server fairly near you. I used to play quite acceptably on a 
26.4k dial up connection. Servers will be down some of course, that is 
inevitable. I'd say in general SoE is about average on uptime/downtime 
ratio with this game. It's not like, say, SWG where they have to reboot 
the server every morning, resulting in an hour's downtime (and as an 
aside any server code that was in that state where you have to reboot 
that often to keep the leaks and bugs from getting out of hand needs to 
be rewritten from scratch... but that's another rant). However, 
especially if you play on a non Euro server, maintenance patches may 
often occur during your prime time. Whenever possible, they patch the 
Euro servers in early AM for Europe.

PoP: Ease of transport. Personally I think you shouldn't be able to use 
a PoP stone till you've gone to the other end the hard way anyway. Some 
tradeskill bits. Otherwise the content is for 46+.
LoY: I'd get this (in fact, I did) just for the extra bank space and 
additional bits they added, like the enhanced looking for group tool. 
Also, it enables Froggies to be played.
LDoN: Instanced group content from like 20-65. If I start playing again, 
I'd buy it in a heartbeat. This is not a soloer's expansion.

No problem.
