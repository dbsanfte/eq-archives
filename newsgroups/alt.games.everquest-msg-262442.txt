Our guild handles it this way: On our website, in the forum section,
we have a calendar where anyone and everyone can schedule hunts/raids
on a first-come, first-serve basis. Very few rules exist regarding
scheduling hunts other than 'Don't schedule a hunt/raid that conflicts
with an already scheduled hunt/raid' and 'People in their probationary
period with the guild cannot schedule epic hunts/raids on the calendar.'
(If they can get a pickup group to go with them, that's okay.)

So, if anyone starts complaining about not getting guild support with
their epic, the response is 'Schedule it on the calendar. People will
show up.'
