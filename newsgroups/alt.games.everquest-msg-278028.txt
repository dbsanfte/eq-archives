Velium Hound Fur is for the coldain prayer shawl quest. I'd expect most 
people who just buy it at 700pp, or 1k, or 2k are buying it for the 
quest... but perhaps not.

By -not- blowing 350k on velium hound fur. ;) At least not unless 
they've got 500k coming in from something else they're doing.

As any wealthy individual will tell you: spend less than you make and 
you eventually will be rich.

Sadly, most people spend exactly what they make. (and more if they can 
borrow it). These people will never be rich. Even if they had a million 
pp they'd be perma-broke again in a few months. (Just like too many 
lotto winners in the real world)

EQ unlike the real world has no tempting credit industry, has no 
unexpected cash flow jolts (e.g. medical emergencies, car accidents), 
and doesn't even have any regular ongoing costs beyond rations and water 
flasks. (No mortgages, clothing expenses, insurance, phonebills, taxes 
etc...)

In EQ its trivially easy to spend less than you make, it causes me no 
end of amusement that so many people are still perpetually broke, living 
at the edge of or beyond their means. 

It seems to be a part of the human condition for the great majority. EQ 
is a great social experiment in that regard, because it proves that even 
if you remove all the overhead of life, and give people complete control 
over their expenses relative to their income a huge pile of them will 
wind up perpetually broke.
