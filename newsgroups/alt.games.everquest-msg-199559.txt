No offense, but what I've been offered in the way of convincing data 
hardly compares to the credibility I would assume where the holy trinity 
is concerned.

We're not talking about doing it yourself here though.

It *has* to be enough. Eventually, everyone will be flagged. The fact 
that, and I have agreed to as much on several occasions here, the trials 
need fixed doesn't mean they should be removed.

Honestly. Of those "alleged" 90%, how many do you really think were truly 
dedicated to the cause? I doubt it was all that many. Unfortunately, the 
instant-gratification crowd permeates most aspects of EverQuest just like 
they do anything else.

Your not being able to convince me is *not* the same thing as my not 
being able to admit it. I will happily admit it with full apologies for 
wasting the time or you and anyone else involved here if you can simply 
give me more supporting data than "I've been there. Take my word for 
it." Honestly, and no offense is meant here, but if a person were to fail 
to find a way to pass the trials merely due to their own shortcomings, 
whether it be a lack of intestinal fortitude or simply wanting more then 
they were yet capable of accomplishing, they would likely offer the exact 
same arguments.

I know I won't insist they be made easier for me. I know I'm finished 
here. Period. I really mean it this time.  :)
