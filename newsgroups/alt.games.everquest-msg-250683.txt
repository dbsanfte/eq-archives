Casting a spell takes time and mana, and then there's a spell duration.

Hide and Sneak work (if they work at all) instantly, and you don't have 
to memorize them or have any mana left to use them, and once activated 
they stay active till you break them.

One of the things that breaks Camoflage (and other invisibility spells) 
is trading with vendors; with sneak you can walk up behind a vendor, 
sneak, and get him to treat you as if he neither liked nor disliked you.

Hide is handy if you need to go afk for an extended period of time, or 
are watching for a mob to pop, or even just to sit and meditate 
unmolested; get it working and you can stay hidden for hours.

You don't actually have those skills as a druid, anyway.  You have them 
as a racial feature as a halfling; your skill starts at 50 in them, and 
will never get any better.  This means they'll never be all that 
reliable, just handy tools that other druids don't get.

Hide and sneak combined is one of the greatest skill features in the 
game, but only rogues can actually use it; other classes break hide when 
they move even if sneaking at the time.  For a rogue, this allows 
movement while more invisible than any other class; can't be seen by 
live or dead (Invis to Undead and Camo/Invis don't both work at the same 
time on anyone).  A halfling rogue has a serious head start with both 
those highly useful skills at 50 on creation... but for other classes, 
its not such a big deal.
