If all new characters were built on the newbie server and then transfered
after some range of levels, then there wouldn't be any twinks until they
were transferred to the server with their mains.  However, requiring all new
characters on one server could be a big negative - no mules, etc. etc.

Overall the idea could work for new players, though.
