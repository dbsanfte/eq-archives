The good ol' U. S. of A. was behind the attacks, in that case. US
taxpayers paid for Taliban weapons, and CIA "advisors" trained the
terrorists (Or, as they were called back then, "freedom fighters").
Not to mention the fact that Baghdad was supported by the US too,
in the Iran-Iraq war. Now, this is all proven, but I have never
seen proof that Iraq funds Taliban terrorist camps, or any other
terrorist camps for that matter. Interesting, that.

One wonders if *you* see the connection?
