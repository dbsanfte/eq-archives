Yeah.  I thought the post itself was awful damned tame after reading
the topic.  In fact, I wouldn't have read the thread at all if I had
not recognized the name of the poster, was curious whether Ben had
gone off the deep end more than enything else.  Even so, beyond the
topic I don't see much of anything to support <your> assertion that
he is "a stalking, sore loser, loon".  Making a (mostly) unsupported
attack on Ben and demanding that he defend himself, isn't that pretty
much the same as the old "So, when did you stop beating your wife?".
