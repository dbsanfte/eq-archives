No kidding.  When I think of all the hours (and hours and hours) I
spent on boats back before any of my characters had made even L20,
when 10pp for a port was totally out of the question (back in the
good old days, when your first magic weapon was a Combine Longsword
bought from a gypsy for over 50pp).  If PoK ports had come in back
then, WOW!, I would've been in heaven.  No more 90 minute jogs from
Everfrost to Unrest.  Would've been fantastic.
