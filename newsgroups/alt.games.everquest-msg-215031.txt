One of Aoebe's favorite pastimes is to
go to remote places and check vendor
inventory.  A vendor that has 80 slots,
used to have a few slots, that I'll call
'excess inventory, that's under the counter'.

When Aoebe would buy out something small,
say an item unusual to the area and inexpensive,
there would be an open slot.  She then would sell
*one* test item into that slot.  If it appeared in that
slot, there were none 'under the table',  If she heard
the 'chaching' sound and it disapeared, there were more
to be had 'under the table'.  She would do this
for about nine to ten items that she wanted to see
about..

Then she would buy out the small, useless junk until
the items 'under the table' were put in inventory.

That seems to not work now.  When a slot is bought
out, there are 79 items and one open slot.....

So, vendor mining has been nerfed?
