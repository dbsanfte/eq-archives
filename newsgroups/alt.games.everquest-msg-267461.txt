I was playing in the WoW beta. It's loads of fun but if you don't like 
doing quests you'll end up not getting a crucial spell or ability.  
There's alot of quests, more than enough to keep you busy near your home 
town, I personally love doing quests. One crucial difference between EQ 
quests and WoW quests: They actually give you good clues.  For example: 
JoeBlow tells you to go Northwest to the Crystal Lake to gather 
mushrooms.  In EQ, Crystal lake would be at least 5 zones away and not 
actually called Crystal lake anywhere on any map, plus the mushrooms you 
have to kill are 10 levels higher than you and the reward is  crappy and 
the xp gained is not worth it.  In WoW, Crystal Lake is a very short 
walk northwest, when you find Crystal Lake you get xp for finding it, 
it's clearly marked on the map and the agro mobs are spaced far enough 
apart that a careful adventurer no matter what class will be able to 
fight their way to the mushrooms and be able to gather them or will be 
able to just avoid the agro mobs altogether.  When you've gathered the 
mushrooms and turn them in you are given a nice chunk of xp and an item 
that 80% of the time is an upgrade, and if not, sells to merchant for 
enough to make it worthwhile.

The most fun is on the PVP servers, it's factional PVP so you have to 
travel to  find your enemies but my orc hunter spent a good hour getting 
killed by humans tonight, lots of fun.  Never had so much fun playing EQ 
PVP.  If you buy WoW you'll never go back to EQ, it's that much better.
