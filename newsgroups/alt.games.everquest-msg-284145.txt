	A cleric isn't necessary but I think a dedicated healer is.
That can be a cleric druid or shaman (or necro??? nahhhh :-)  I think
you need a dedicated healer for two reasons:  

	1.  This player needs to be able to manager her mana to
optimize healing.  For instance, by choosing a set of focus gear
that saves extra mana on beneficial spells or by not having to spend
reserve mana on resisted slows.

	2.  Unless the character is extraordinarily well geared and
well developed or the content is well below the player's maximum
levle, having to perform 2 roles will inevitably lead to performing
both at a level below the best possible for either.  For instance,
the shaman main healer may have to wait to slow the add because
he needs to get a quick heal on the tank, and when mezz is resisted
the chanter is now faced with an angry *and* unslowed mob who chews
right through both runes.  Now the chanter needs an extra quick heal
and there's still a mob to slow.  That won't matter if the mobs are 
weak in comparison to the players or if the shaman has 1400 AA's and
15K mana but will slow down most other groups.

	In fact I think it would be safe to expand my theory even
further and say that on challenging content you need a dedicated AND
patch healer for best throughput.  That can be druid/druid, shaman/druid,
etc., but IMHO the main healer should be a cleric.  A cleric won't be 
distracted by the temptation or need to nuke, slow, or snare.  A cleric
can risk badly timed heals because she can take a hit (it's suprising
how long a cleric can stand there and take hits, after all, they're
casters right? But a high AC and plate class mitigation help).  A cleric's
almost certainly optimized her character for healing (as opposed to
dotting and healing, or nuking and healing).  And of course, a cleric
simply heals more powerfully than any other class.  (Including necromancers! 
:-)

	So that was a really long way of saying yes you DO need clerics. :-)
