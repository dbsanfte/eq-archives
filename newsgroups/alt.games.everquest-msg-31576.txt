As I told Wantsomedrinks - if you have to have it explained to you,
then you're not capable of understanding the answer.

I had nothing to be vindictive about - I'd never met or interacted
with Wantsomedrinks prior to the exchange I detailed.

>for maybe the same thing happening to you at some point perhaps?

That was a sloppy attempt at ad hominem, if ever I've seen one. 

Sorry to disappoint - I've never had a name changed, or even
petitioned, that I'm aware of. You see, unlike some people, I'm
capable of comprehending and obeying the rules I agree to, and I can
muster enough creativity to come up with a valid character name.
