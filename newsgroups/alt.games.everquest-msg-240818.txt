And the original post clearly indicated we're talking about midtier
PoP mobs.

Are you going to try to claim you're MTing Mith Marr, Bertox, Rallos
Zek with NO EB weapon?

I didn't think so.

So no, you haven't "been there done that". The rules change as you go
up. I'm not berating your uberness or lack thereof, I am just
explaining you can't have your casters and other high aggro people
easing off against some mobs just so you can hold aggro with weapons
that don't generate enough of it.

And that is, with 100% surety, just flat out incorrect. Skill only
gets you so far, at some point you have to have the gear.
