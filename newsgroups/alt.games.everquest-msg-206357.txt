A thought: bards need to pop a rare spawn mob in SF to get an epic drop.
Hundreds and hundreds of mobs will have to die to do this.  If you can group up
with a bard, you'll be working on both epics at the same time; there's no
reason not to kill the mobs he wants dead as compared to any others, all have
the same chance to drop shards.

There may well be other epic drops in SF for all I know, the more jobs you are
doing simultaneously the better.  That said, heck, the mobs drop ok cash and
spell loot, and are exp.  Not fantastic exp or loot, but at least its not
camping greens for 16 hours (lord B) and 14 hours (Grimblox) like I did.
