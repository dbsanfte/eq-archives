I knew that, but how do I determine which society to join, then? I know I
can see all the societies listed with current level and number of members,
but how do I know what their specialty is?

Of course, I could travel around and see who'll let me in, but I'd hate to
resign from my current society, and lose my hard-earned status points,
unless I'm certain to find something better. It's also very convenient to
have my room, wholesaler and outfitter society in the same zone.

Does anybody know where the serious Qeynos outfitters meet on the Highkeep
server?
