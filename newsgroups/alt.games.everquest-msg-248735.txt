And what followed was a series of "what EQ2 does better than EQ", with
the requisite back-and-forth about the new game.

Simple question... why can't all of these features be phased in over
time in EQ? The features you discuss would all be less impact than the
pathing change a couple years ago, so SOE could write it, test it and
phase it in to the existing game.

Why start playing a NEW GAME in order to get those features from the
same company that demonstrated an unwillingness to fix such problems
in their previous game?

I don't see EQ2 as a threat. I see EQ2 as a way to divide the
community so that WoW and CoH have an easier time getting started.
Sounds like a bad plan to me.
