There certainly is a solution to terrorism . It works, like many other
things, every time it is tried. For instance the palestinians have had this
solution used before against them . Jordan *used* to have a palestinian
terrorism problem, then the palestinians had a black tuesday. Anything less
than this is a measured response trying to save the lives of stupid pawns,
and like most good deeds will not go unpunished.

People who say we will fight to the last man for our beliefs ,the majority
of the time are called on to prove it. This is and always has been a world
governed by the aggressive use of force. Terrorism is odd in that the only
thing protecting the terrorists is the unwillingness of the injured to
protect themselves. The fundamentalist movement of Islam made a very bad
mistake in judging the will and resolve of americans . We are a warlike and
military people whos aggression is controlled only by our sense of fairness
and morality. What our country is doing now is but a minor appeasement to
the portion of us who would strongly advocate get rid of Islam now. If the
Islamic terrorists can be prevented from doing anything else it will
hopefully work and we will be spared watching what a real jihad is like.
