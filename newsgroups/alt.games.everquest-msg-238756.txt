To answer your initial question.. no, im not dissapointed with GoD.

800 expeditions and trials?  You say you've been farming potime for months..
so Id imagine the guild is generally well geared (at least to a level that
Vxed and Tipt are trivial).. you can also kill Smith Rondo to bypass all the
sewer mission flags, a VERY easy raid

So thats what, 2 expeditions and 1 easy raid, and you are flagged for
Kod'Taz

2 expeditions and 1 raid, and you are flagged for a zone where trash mobs
drop 100hp+ gear, easily farmable augs as good as the best ldon ones, and
small (1 groupable) named mobs, who drop loot upto 180HP/mana/endurance,
with a whole ream of stats and effects

I have already upgraded a potime elemental god loot item, with a trivial mob
drop from kod'taz

Its fairly tough, agreed. Its not out of whack tho.. if anything its TOO
EASY for the kindof sick loots that are dropping, named mobs who live for 20
seconds, and drop loot equivalent to Inni in plane of time, possibly the
hardest mob in time.

For what its worth.. I don't have 11k, I don't have 2k+ ac.. nor am I even a
warrior (monk), and I can tank mobs in Kod'Taz.  Its not the most efficient
tanking in the world, but that holds true anywhere that a monk/rng tanks
over a plate class.

Paladins and SK's can easily tank in Kod'Taz, and that goes for the small
named mobs too

Now the Ikk 1 group trials.. thats another story. Its extremely tough, which
almost makes warriors a necessity.. but at present only 1 single person in
the guild needs to pass those trials, in order to grant your guild raid
access in Ikk.   Those trials also drop 160hp earing/rings everytime, which
are amazingly nice

The last year was spent dumbing down EQ.. this expansion finally puts a
challenge back into the game. And i mean a real challenge, no more trivial
exp farms, every single pull can be devstating, CR (death) is back to being
meaningful and a big deal..

A big thumbs up here, altho admittedly they did go a bit far in some
places... kos mobs roaming all around the quest givers and flag fixing dudes
is just stupid.. and the new raid content, whilst very well thought of, and
very imaginative compared to previous expansions, is horribly buggy.  Once
the bugs are resolved though, the next batch of up-coming guilds is gonna
have a whale of a time seeing the new events
