To be honest, I don't know, I was answering the more general question 
here.  Might have to go with a 60 mission instead of 65 or something like 
that for a DCable mob.  I am pretty sure there are not DCable mobs in a 
65 adventure now that I think about it, wouldn't they have to be lt blue 
to a level 65?
