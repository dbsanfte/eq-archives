Just to let you all know, it was something I didn't try...when you go and
patch the Test patch, you also have to go back after, and click the Advanced
button, and patch the Standard one as well.  That will help, atleast it did
for me.  Thank goodness because I was about to pull out my hair.  Thanks for
the ideas though, they were some other things I looked at as well.
