Even when the regular is acting like a complete ass? Which is
something I've noticed in the couple months I've been lurking here. 

I'm not sure if its something about the game, or just maybe a certain
type of person that seems to be drawn to Everquest, but there are TONS
of assholes and rude jerks out there. 

Of course I've met quite a few nice guys/gals too, but the ratio of
assholes to non-assholes seems to be tilted heavily in the direction
of the former, rather than the latter. More so than my experiences in
RL would indicate. 

The only reason I haven't killfiled DT is because every so often,
buried deep within his rudeness and lack of social manners, I find a
small snippet of information that I find useful. Is it worth the
tradeoff? Not really, but then I'm not one to give up on a lost cause,
such DT learning what manners are. 

Of course, by making this post, I'll forever more be labeled a troll
and prolly *plonked* by a few...but oh well, life goes on.
