Actually, I think the original poster was trying to show that
America has "favourites", and that when *Israel* commits
an act of war against the US, it gets a free pass, but
such consideration would never be extended to other
attackers.

The point is "America has double standards".

I think this is true, and it *is* relevant to the Israel/Palestine
situation (unlike in Northern Ireland, where the US was
widely seen to be an honest broker by both sides in
that conflict, the whole world knows that the US is
more partial to the Israeli side in the Israel/Palestine
conflict)

However, I don't think it's that big a deal in general
that America treats its friends differently from its
enemies.
