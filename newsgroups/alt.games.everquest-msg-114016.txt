   Well, the one problem with showing some initiative an
forming a group with the the other /ooc lfg'ers is that then
generally speaking you get/have to be the party leader.  
   Fairly often, when I group with people other than just
Lenny, sooner or later I turn into the leader (Magic! 
Presto!).  Usually, this is fine;  I like the challenges of
keeping a group going, knowing when to call _run!_,  seeing
that the members happy and productive, without stepping over
the line of actually telling others how to play their class
(I really don't like it when I'm in a group where the leader
over-manages).  But  it is harder than just being a party
member, and sometimes I simply don't have the energy for
it.  I guess other people might have other reasons for not
wanting to be the leader as well.
