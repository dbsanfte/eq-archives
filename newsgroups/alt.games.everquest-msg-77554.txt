This is actually quite false. The cleric is not adding to the melee's
damage at all (like a shaman would with the quickness line) and he or
she is not particularly reducing the monster's damage either (again,
like a shaman would with his or her slows). The cleric also brings
nothing misc to the table like a druid would.

When it comes to melees, they pair best with shamans and classes that
can both fear and snare (or just fear if its a snaring ranger in the
first place). Clerics are about the slowest possible support class
they could pair with.

Yes, it works fine. Every other melee/support combo just works better
later on.

And when it comes down to it in the end, the best class for pairing
with a cleric IS rogue, because they can do enough damage on their
own, and later on can even time backstabs with cleric stuns, while not
really having to worry about getting hurt, since they have their own
private cleric.
