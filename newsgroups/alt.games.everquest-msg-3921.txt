NO kidding. A friend of mine at work tried to get me to change to RZ because
it's "more realistic." How realistic is it that every time I try to sit down
NEXT TO A CITY GUARD, some guy comes along and kills me for the rusty sword
I'm carrying? I'm sorry, That's not ANYONE'S version of reality. I won't go
back. It's not real, it's chaos.

Life is complex, meaning some of it is real, and some of it is imaginary.
