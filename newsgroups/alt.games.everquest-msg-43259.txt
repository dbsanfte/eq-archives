Sometimes one manufacturer's card will be different than another's (although
this is less common with the Geforce2 and subsequent chipsets). For instance,
my GeForce2 MX400 is an Abit Siluro.

That is your Operating Aystem :)

BIOS chipsets generally come in 3 flavours: Award, Phoenix and AMI, although
many large manufacturers will have their own, such as Micron, intel, IBM and
Compaq.

Defragging your hard drive is a good way to improve overall performance in
EverQuest.

I pesonally recommend using a fixed swap file (setting the minimum and
maximum to the same numbers), with 512 MB hard RAM you should set your swap
file to 256MB or 512MB, I'd recommend the same amount as physical RAM to be
on the safe side. Also, defragging with the Windows Defrag utility does not
help your swap file, almost every other Defragger (I use Norton's SpeedDisk)
will do the swap file.

Best to keep at it. Theoretically your system should not have any problems
with the latest Detonators; however, in practice, anything that runs Windows
9x is more likely to not work than to work (only a small exaggeration :P).
That said, stay away from Win2K or XP for gaming.
