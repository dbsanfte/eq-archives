That's because you're used to the pov/pos/bot/hoh exp level on your other
characters though.  Eh, I'm more tolerant of people I know/like anyways
rather than random_gimp74.

While I was camping the exiled soldier of marr in PoJ for my HoH alternate
access key thingy (got trooper and officer in first 15 minutes, soldier took
8 hours longer) I saw a FIFTY FUCKING ONE druid shouting for a trial group
for at least 3 hours, can you say "FUCKING USELESS"?
