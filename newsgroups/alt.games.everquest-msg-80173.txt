I'd like to amend myself here.  Through the years, I've
found that memory-resident virus-checking products are
the worst culprits for horribly bogging a system down.
Often, they either consume insane amounts of CPU cycles, or
they're so thorough about trying to catch viruses as they
load that they scan just about everything that the computer
runs or reads from disk (which of course adds a great amount
of overhead to the system).
