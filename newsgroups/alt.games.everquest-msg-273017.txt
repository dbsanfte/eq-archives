It seems that there is a basic misunderstanding of what is legal here...

The historical examples you have given are examples of people being 
illegaly incarcerated.  The fact that it happened does not make it legal.  
I don't doubt that somewhere here in the US, it can still happen, and if 
it  does, it is still happening illegaly.  In fact, the US is currently 
holding any number of people without charging them with a crime, not in 
the US proper.  Many would argue, and in fact have, that even that is 
illegal.

My original statement was merely that people are not generally jailed 
without at least some excuse of a law being broken.  I did not qualify it 
at the time, but, since we live in this particular time period, I was 
speaking of this particular time period.
