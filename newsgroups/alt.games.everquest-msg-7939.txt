A couple of additions that skew this....

a) Against weaker mobs that die quickly its better to go for the faster
 weapons as they will get the strikes in, same holds in a group
that is doing continuous hunting as you get the damage in and waste less
as the high delay weaps get out of sync. In longer fights this ofcourse
evens out completely.

b) IF you are a hybrid, skew to those weaps that have high delay since
they give you more opportunity to kick of a spell in between strikes I
believe.....
