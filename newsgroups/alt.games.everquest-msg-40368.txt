People already answered but here's why I said it:

1) It is really easy to fall to your doom, especially trying to find the
ramp down off of a high platform.

2) A big whopping total of 0 landmarks of any value, all the platforms for
the most part look the same, unless you feel like remembering every
merchant's name.

3) The only possible way I can find the bank or druid guild is to find the
PoD lift, which is usually fairly difficult.

4) I spent 4 hours wandering around it trying to find the #$^%#ing
stationary sewing kit because I needed to make a piece of patchwork ( not 4
consecutive hours, and yes I realize I should've just killed some stuff and
bought a large sewing kit )

5) Aggro issues on the Z-axis with stuff below you.
