<snip story>

Well done! This is only one more example of why I keep insisting that
"Necros are insane!".  My warriro didn't manage to kill Slate until he
was level fifty, and that was with a 49 cleric sitting in the background
spending more than half a bar of mana casting Celesital Heals on me.
That you could solo him at 39 is just proof that the necro class is
totally over the top. I can't even imagine what they were like in the
pre-nerfbat days.  I'm still soloing yellows, and grouped with a Necro
four levels below me, the two of us were taking things that were
deeeeeeeep red to her last night with no problems.
