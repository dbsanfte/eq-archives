Fair enough. As I pointed out, I could have made it monosylabic and
spelled it out better, true. But the phrase "when we wre in a really
tough fight" also has the word "were" in it which implies past tense.
Your phrasing was certainly more accurate, though. However the lack of
pinpoint accuracy in a quickly typed Usenet answer was no excuse for the
assholish backlash I got in a totally flame-free response. YMMV as well.
