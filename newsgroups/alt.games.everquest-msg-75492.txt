at 11 my human warrior was pretty poor lol. If you can get like a few
friends together, go over to south qeynos and get the boat to the island
between Erudin and Qeynos. Circle round the island to the wreck on the far
shore. You could pull the zombies from the wreck, they all drop raw hide
armour i think. I used some of that. I wouldn't advise that place solo but
it *could* be done I guess. You'd need to know zombie levels. You can also
get cloth/raw hide from the BlackBurrow.

 If you have the money you might look for some bronze (costs 2pp/AC as a
rule). My full set cost about 100pp ish. Bit more than it worth. If your on
Solusek Ro I'm trying to get rid of my old bronze, in Gfay. I give you a
good price on it.

You wont be able to get crafted for a while yet, like until your high 20s
I'd think.
