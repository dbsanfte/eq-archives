Pfft...  Quit ya whining...  When you buy your Veilous Rings for Iceclad
Ocean, Wakening Lands, Great Divide and Cobalt Scar...  You will see red
mobs all the time when you first get them.

First time I went to Iceclad, Bitch slapped by a wandering Blizzard Dervish
before I had a chance to cast a sow and figure away out of there.  Died
instantly.

Wakening Lands - Wuoshi... Nuff said.

Cobalt Scar - Wandering drakes or wyverns if you aren't careful, no real
zone to run to.

Great Divide - For Druids, safe... Not as many wandering mobs.  For wizards
and Luclin port riders...  Right in the middle of the wandering Frost
giants and their puppies.

Now from what I see of the Druid Ports...  Grimling Forest, Twilight Sea,
Dawnshroud and Nexus...  Those are speed gimmies.  Dawnshroud, Twilight Sea
and Grimling are high for low 20s, but they were more meant for players in
their 30s or escorted lowbies so that they can get around faster, much
similar to EK, NK, DL, and the Velious ports.  A neophyte Druid should be
scared to go to some of these places, mostly because there are mobs that
would rape you and eat you (Like Grimfeather, who does wander by the Druid
Rings on occasion, and now the Silver Griffon) and that is one of the level
19 Ring spells.

You will find some of the other ports spells, from Kunark and above, then
to have things that will kill you faster than you can scream, mostly due to
the nature of the areas.
