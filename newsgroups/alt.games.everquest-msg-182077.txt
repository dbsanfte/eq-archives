In pop having a ranger pull with snare is a lot easier than a monk pulling
(from an enchanter point of view). I can tash and slow the mobs as they inc,
before anyone needs to engage. Agro just isnt an issue. In pop, it can be
scary trying to tash and slow a lvl 62 mob thats not snared, and only has a
warrior taunting.
