If you take a look on Lucy, you will see that the haste effect on items 
is level based, but, the level of the effect is set on the item, and is 
not based on the level of the player.  The only ones I could not 
determine were a couple of charms with haste effect, and that is likely 
variable based on whatever makes the charm work better.

Out of curiosity I looked through all the haste items listed there.  Lots 
of haste items set at 41% haste, two over that, Recherche` Belt of Curwin 
at 51%, and Shroud of Survival at 46%.
