In Katta Castelum, they sell the full assortment of bard instruments
as Combine (similar to the Combine Long Sword et al) for
reasonably low twink prices, 20pp or so each.

Minimal testing shows a speed improvement with the Combine
Hand Drum similar to that of the Drum of the Jarhin Recruit,
Allakhazam's quest posting for that indicates that both are
perhaps 5% better than a plain hand drum.

Unfortunately, the bard site I've looked at doesn't have -either-
of these two instruments listed at all, so knowing that one
is as good as the other does me little good in plotting a next
step.

Worse, I can't find any comparisons for the -other- combine
instruments either.  Is a combine lute really just as good as
a lute of the gypsy princess?
