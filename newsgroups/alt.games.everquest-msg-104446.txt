    You mean like how using bardsploits you can stack damage shields until
the cows come home? Or how you were able to stack Symbol spells for a while?
Or how a bard can solo Sontalak (and, by extension, pretty much all the rest
of Western Wastes) by using broken assist mechanisms? I saw that one post on
the Concert Hall saying "Don't post sploits here, or we'll be nerfed! Fight
the man!" I was less than impressed.
