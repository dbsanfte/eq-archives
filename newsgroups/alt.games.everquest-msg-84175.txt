Here's my latest two guilds of any of my MT characters, and impressions:

Elven Elite:
very friendly and helpful people, most of them.
A little too big guild for my taste, much raidchat on the guild channel most
of the time.

Joined it cause they persuaded me. =)

Mithril Ankh:
a newly started guild with "skilled professionals" of each class.

Joined it to meet my "childhood" friends again.


What uproar? what did I miss??

/D
