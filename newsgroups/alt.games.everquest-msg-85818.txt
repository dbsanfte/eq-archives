I usually have 2 AOE stuns memmed.  I use them to stun a mob so I can get 
it mezzed, I use them to stun a caster to interrupt their casting ( which 
can make some heavy-damage casters a trivial encounter ), and I use them to 
chain-stun some hard-hitting MOBs if the Cleric is LOM or OOM.

If there are 1 or 2 other guys hitting on a mob, I very rarely get the 
aggro if all I have done is stun them ( even repeatedly ).  If I have 
tashed them and slowed them ( slow seems to draw an inordinate amount of 
aggro ) and then start stunning them, then I will get aggro a lot.

Basically, the stuns themselves don't seem to me to generate a lot of hate.  
Whether that is a special property of Chanter stuns or not, I can't tell 
you as I don't stun with my other chars.
