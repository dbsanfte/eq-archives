Circle of three, and actually there are some quests to raise it, its been
a while but I've run several Erudite casters who immediately moved
to Qeynos, and raised this instead of taking the boat back to train and
buy spells. Most of the quests involved runing out to QH and back, at
first with just one quest, but later you could run three or four
simultanteously.
Getting a bind right at the caster area to come back to helps.

ps maybe its order of three...
