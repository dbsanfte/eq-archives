Somekind sould gave me a weopon last night - it just seem to appear
instead of my mouse pointer whilst I was trading, didnt get the name
but it was quite quick and damaged for 6.  Swapped a few characters
still had weopon, logged on today no weapon just a rusty warhammer in
its place :( is this some kind of summoned weopon??
