Try the Pandas in Stonebrunt if your rules dont allow to sell in the
bazaar.I found they drop amazinlgy often a Mithril Amulet and gems
in the same price range,maybe at the same time you can quest for
"Wakizashi of the Frozen Sky" 22/6 with 80 damage proc 1hander,
which maybe can be an update for one of your  guildmates under
the rules you are playing.
Of course this wont be great cash as farming spiderling silks.
