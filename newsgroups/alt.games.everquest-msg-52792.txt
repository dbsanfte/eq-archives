One way I do it (although I have yet to duel for anything but pure
fun..which usually ends up with me fighting hand to hand for  a laugh) is
root, blind (can also toss a fear on for extra measure lol) nuke, stand
behind them and melee if your a scary melee cleric, being a dark elf I also
cast clinging darkness and siphon str with my necklaces, but mainly blind is
a big thing since most melee's you'll be up against will have at least one
throwing/range item. You can drive a monk insane with root and blind and
slowly beat on their backs if you want lol
