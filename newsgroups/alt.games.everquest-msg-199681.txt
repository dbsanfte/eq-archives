I was thinking about trying to get the Twilight quest belt with some 
help (I have some level 51 friends on FV) I have 2 of the 3 rare 
components so far.

I'm not so worried about Jewels at the moment as I'm going to be making 
them soon (Jeweling 190, once I get 34 I will start working with Plat)

What sort of price are these (I know different servers different prices) 
? I was thinking about Dull Metalic here too they are
AC 6 Mana 10 Int 3 Cha 3 SvC 4

> Molten Cloak


Again Dull Metalic would be my choice I think if I can afford it and 
ignoring the 0 AC. But Molten and Mistic are options too.

These would be nice (I need an EH2 item anyhoo) but they are 4kpp atm.


> Pick a robe - SMR, Ice Silk (my personal fave), Bonecaster


Shining Metalic are nice I have been considering these, no Cha but they 
let me replace my Spell Haste 2 Mask.
Ice Silk shure looks nice what is the cost on that ?
Bone casters is not bad, but a set-back for Cha

> Thurg quest Cap and Glove


Mmm they are nice peices.


> Golden Bracer


Yep if I see one of these for sale I will get it, I need an Extended 
range item and this fits the bill. The only other real choice is Fancy 
Velvet Mantle, and I doubt that I will get that for a while. Or Fine 
Antique Velvet Rose and the combination of no binds and TLC on FV kind 
of screw up this quest.

You've managed to get two GM Trade tools ?
I'm impressed.
Interesting that you still have the same arms as me.
Is there nothing better, or are you just lazy ;-) ?
Again Dull metalic look good to me.
AC5 HP10 Mana15 Agi3 Int3 Cha4 SvD5 And they cost under 2k.
