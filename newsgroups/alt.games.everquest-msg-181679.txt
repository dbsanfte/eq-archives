Holy shit!  You just broke his usenet nose!  If we're going to continue to
draw parallels, why stop there?  You've now been arrested for assault and
battery.  I don't think your plea to the judge of "but look at me, I can
kick his ass!" is going to garner much sympathy.  I'm sure your inmates will
give you a _very_ warm welcome.

The other side to your awful truth is that physical size/appearance on
usenet (and often even in real life!)means exactly shit.  Get over it.
