Thats not quite whats being suggested though.   The key part of the post was
leading the general around all of the fights without engaging the giants.,
the SoW was just to make it easier while leading him past the giants.

And no, unless things have changed, it is not possible.   Escort NPC's have
to follow thier path.  If he his aggroed and led away from his path, he will
return to the spot where he was aggroed before continuing, even if you drop
him at the completion point.
