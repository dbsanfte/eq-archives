one simple fact: The group does MUCH better when the warrior concentrates on
killing. if he's killing non stop, the exp goes non stop. during the time it
takes him to run out, catch 4-5 mobs, and run back, he could have been
killing the one mob at a time that the enchanter pulls. don't get me wrong.
Both groups do alright. but in my experience it goes alot smoother, with
alot less chance of 'crap enchanter/cleric down' if there's a constant
supply of 1-2 mobs as apposed to the occasionsonal 5 inc...

and the rate of pulling in DL all depends on location. with a good group set
IN a pathing location there doesn't even have to be pulling. a good location
imo is near FV cave right next to the two iksaur statues. I did a couple
high 40's groups there and they plain kicked arse! NO one had to pull...
mobs walked right by... I (The enchnater) either just out right mezzed them,
or tash then mezzed (to strategically place them near group)... problem
every now and then was to many wandering by but don't think many deaths
occured
