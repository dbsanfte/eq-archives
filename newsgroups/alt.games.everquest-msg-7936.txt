He didn't say anything to me about what he was doing down there. I had been
clearing that area for at least an hour and a half, he had been there for
5-10 minutes. The second person "on the scene" was a monk looking for
fingers - he asked me if he could also hang out there, and said he would
give me the 4" finger if he found one (since that was the last one I
needed). When #3 showed up, I "assumed" that he was looking for the Jester
because he was a warrior, but he never said anything to me. He could have
"assumed" that I was camping the Jester, which is why he didn't say anything
other than "congrats" when I got the club. He was also in the same guild as
the #2 person, so maybe he just came to keep him company. Who knows.

Besides, both the undead jester and the fingered skeletons spawn in the same
area of Kurn's. You have to kill the same skeletons over and over again to
get them to spawn. Most non-monks who camp the jester wind up with a bunch
of skeleton fingers they can't use (well, four of them since they are lore).
If either of the other 2 people had killed the Jester, I would have probably
just cursed my bad luck and kept looking for fingers.

I think in this case, it was my "camp" and there were no hard feelings. If
someone had already been camping the jester when I arrived, I would have
asked him/her if they minded if I looked for fingers. And let them have the
Jester if it actually did pop.

Maybe I suck.. lol.. but then again, I have to expect to get at least one
flame whenever I post to this newsgroup! :-)
