Hi,

Some time ago I wrote eqtech about my problem EQ crashing if I 
accidentally press the menu key. But the answer look wierd to me. They 
made me laugh but it was of no help.

1 - pop out the key from the keyboard (LOL)
2 - Ask Microsoft how to disable it ??? (LOL)

Hey dear Verant, an application is not supposed to crash when you hit a 
key right ?

I didn't had this problem before the luclin patches.


Down here is the complete quote.

Any help greatly appreciated

<--- Message quote from Verant Tech Support and my question --->
Hello Lea,

The Windows key must be disabled from your end. You can pop the key out
of the key board or contact Microsoft on how to disable it through the
keyboard menu. I apologize for the inconvenience.

If this does not solve your issue, please email me back or contact our
phone support Mon.-Fri, 8:30 A.M.-5:30 P.M. PST, at (858)537-0898.
Please be sure to include your original message with all future
correspondence regarding this matter.

Regards,

Hello,
I'm Lea Gris
Account : **********
I run Everquest Kunark+Velious on W2K french
Since the luclin patch (may be before). The windows menu key is no
longer
disabled in EverQuest. Very often I hit that key instead of the
alt+number
to cast a spell and this bring me back to the windows desktop and
EverQuest
crash.
I was lucky not to die while this happened two times in combat.
I have sent bug report about this but please bring fast fixes for this
problem. I'll for sure petition a GM if I die beause of my EqClient
crash
while accidentally hitting the menukey.
Regards
L?a Gris
