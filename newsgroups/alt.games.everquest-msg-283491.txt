If you are level 69 or 70, go sit/LFG at RS camp in RSS.  There is a
reasonably nice pet focus item that drops all the time and rots quite a
lot up there.  This is where the Pyrillen (sp?) Riftseeker spawns, we
just call it the RS or RSS camp.  It's above the stairs camp and below
the res/sum camp (researcher and summoner).  If you dont know the zone
you may want to get some help finding it as some mobs see invis and
being spotted is near certain death without a group.  Once you find
it--it's a big room with 6 or 8 mobs standing around in a circle--you
can camp your mage there safely on the wall.  Just don't move.
