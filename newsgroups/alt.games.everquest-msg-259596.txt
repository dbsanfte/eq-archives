For the record, this technique worked perfectly and within a few minutes 
(like 10) I was able to verify that distant servers I could access remotely 
were already recognizing the new host definitions and mail continued 
arriving instantly at my server using either connection. Someone suggested 
to me that I should adjust the TTL values on the MX records to 60 minutes to 
force remote mail servers to flush any of my old records out of their cache 
so that they would have to use the new definitions, but I don't think this 
is necessary with my approach, since, whether they use the old definitions 
or the new, they both deliver mail to a valid IP whose server is up and 
running.

Now to configure an appropriate A/B test. I played some UT2004 online last 
night on cable. Had a great game with most Internet game servers showing 
pings from 40 to 150 at the highest. This might be one good portion of an 
overal A/B suite, I'll be sure to include it.
