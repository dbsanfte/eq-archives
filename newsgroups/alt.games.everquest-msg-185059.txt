Just for completions sake, and because I'm so addicted to the world of
Norrath now, I just ordered the Planes of Power, though it'll take me
a while before my main characters are strong enough to take on the
planes.

I do however, have a few questions. 

Is the Plane of Knowledge, that which is supposedly wonderful for
travelling, usable by most/all levels?

Can anyone give some explanation of how to enter/get to the planes?
I've heard it involved books...any more details?

I've heard there's horses in the PoP pack...are they only in certain
places, or are they Norrath wide? Any info on them would also be
useful
