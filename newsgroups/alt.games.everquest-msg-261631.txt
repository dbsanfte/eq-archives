Now turn on all models, set your resolution to 1600x1280, turn on spell
effects, set the textures to high quality, etc., and try.

+/- 3500 I think.

Iksar start at -3500 for FV.

You have to have faction nearly maxed to be dubious to FV.  So 7000 hits. 
At 100 an hour, that's 70 hours.  And that's after they're already green. 
That's two weeks if you're playing the game as a full-time job.

Even if you are correct about +/- 2000 (I do think it's 3500 though), that's
still 4000 hits.  At 100 an hour, that's 40 hours.  Still a week *if* you
play as a full-time job.  Much longer for nearly anyone, as even the people
that play that much usually have to go to raids, etc.
