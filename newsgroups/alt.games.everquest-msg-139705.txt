Fair enough. Let's say there are 400 people (not accounts) in those
guilds. How many of them are casters at level sixty? Screw it. Let's say
they are ALL level sixty and half of them are casters. (No clue how
close that would be to being true. But probably not far off.) Now were'
down to... what? Two hundred people on one server? How many folks per
server average right now? Shall we start pulling up VI's press
statements off their home page again? Point proven. Thank you. It's a
tiny percentage.

Add to that the fact that there may be that many people *in* those
guilds at level sixty, but believe you me, they don't *ALL* have all the
maxed out gear.

Thus far we've seen less than ten wizards post to Graffe's in that
*very* hot topic, stating they were fucked because they were over the
cap. And Graffe's has more wizard subscribers than probably any other
class board except maye the bards and rogues. It includes the ranking
sorcerers from FoH, Afterlife, and even a couple from DH.  If it was
that easy to hit that cap, a hell of a lot more of them would have.

But you can have the cookies anyway. You looked rather thin last time I
saw you. ;-)
