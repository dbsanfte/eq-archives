We actually have had some luck using the PBAOE approach, I can
do about 2/3rds the damage per bub of mana that she can.  Biggest
problem with it is that some of the mobs go for me and some stay on
her, breaking up the formation.  This causes delay while we get them
all tight again, wiping out some of the gain.  We have been able to
kill mobs that she was unable to quad solo, though, because while
its not as easy and not as mana efficient as druid AOE (on four mobs)
it is still quite a lot of damage to add in on top of hers.

I've done this too, I watch her during her pull and help out a bit, then
kill my own mob off after while she meds (snaring my mob for me,
an ENOURMOUS help) or pull off adds and kill them in my less
efficient way.

The thrust of my post, though, was that while I can't help any
better with quadding, I can now work and play well with
a DOT killer, since DOT and DD now mix quite well.  Root
and rot versus snare and nuke has become rot and shoot!

Partnered with a shaman this won't be quite as helpful, since
they have (barring innoruk symbol) no snare, and that makes
DD on the run a lot harder.
