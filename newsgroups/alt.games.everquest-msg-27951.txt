Yes, it's a real address, and also a website :)

Cute guys you have...

It's a shame that the half elf faces in EQ lean so heavily towards
high/wood elf crossovers. The whitehaired female is the closest to
being a likely dark elf hybrid. The blue skin can be considered
recessive trait since I guess changing skin hues within a race would
be complicated, but the eyes and hair could easily have some more
teir'dalesque alternatives.
