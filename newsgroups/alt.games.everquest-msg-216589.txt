While horribly stated, I agree with the general gist of the post. If
you weed through the bitterly skewed junk.

This statement, however, shines as one of the biggest pieces of crap.
NBG isn't a way of saying "I want that". NBG is a way of saying "I can
actually use that on my character and it upgrades what I have. I'm not
just going to pawn it off in the Bazaar or hand it off to a twink alt.
I worked for it with this character, I deserve it if I'm gonna use it.
Give me what I earned!".
