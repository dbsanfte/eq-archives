I was selling several commodity items in the bazaar. Pelts, silks,
bone chips, and leather padding. As I was looking at the prices, I
recalled a lesson from the past. Adam Smith, in the Wealth of Nations,
talked about the "Invisible Hand" and the relation of supply and
demand. It was there before me in a game!

What an object lesson for our young minds full of mush! Here for all
the younger folk in school to see, capitalism in a pure form. No
Taxes, no price supports, we have periods of inflation, and periods of
deflation. We don't need a Federal Reserve, just a server and more
than one person in the bazaar.

What a living ad for the American system of free enterprise and
self-government. Twenty years ago we wondered how to teach nations
coming out of fixed/totalitarian systems of economics how capitalism
works, and the answer is just have them play Everquest. I wish I could
show more complex economic theories here, but this is a nice thing in
itself.

I have seen bone chips go from 1gp selling prices (where they are
sold, not what people are asking for them) up to 1pp (if these are
sold at all) depending on SUPPLY and DEMAND. It is so much easier to
see in the bazaar, unlike the auctioning that went on in the Commons,
Faydark or North Freeport.

I talked about this with a few RL friends, and they tell me about some
people who have a second or third machine with a PC in the bazaar, as
a floor trader, buying and selling to make a mint. It tickles my heart
to see how well it all works.

Now all we need is a stock report and a ticker going across the bottom
of the GUI.

...BNCP 5gp.....LQWP 2pp....HQOWL 150pp....SPLGSLK 5pp....
