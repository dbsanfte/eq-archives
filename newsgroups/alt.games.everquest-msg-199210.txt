    They should be 50-50 chances per combine at her skill. The only rough
part about making them is actually going to Kaladim to pick up the
components off the ground. There's even a brew barrel right beside where
they pop.

    No, the smithing made chain hat is actually pretty bad. This is a
dropped hat from CT, SHM only, AC 15 STR 4 DEX 4 WIS 7 HP 45 MANA 40 PR 5.
There's usually one for sale in my Bazaar for 9 K or so.

    No, honestly I'm not sure. When you go into the factory, you're in a big
room. If you go straight ahead, you get to a four-way intersection. One
passage is back the way you came, and three lead to rooms with a big robot
in the middle. The big robots are all nameds, and they have the annoying
ability to port you to one of the rooms at random. I know on my server some
of the guilds that couldn't kill Aerin'Dar, Behemoth, Grummus, etc. do kill
those bots. I also remember us stumbling in there the first time we went in
the factory, and killing them with some casualties but with no planning or
testing while waiting for everyone to arrive in PoI. So I'm honestly not
sure what sort of force would be required to kill them.

    20 HPs, 50 MANA, 30 points of resists. Not bad. ;-)

    Yeah, the Turgurs is why I didn't say to replace it. If you're a debuff
bot, obviously speed of debuff is more important than an extra 75 HPs or
whatever.

    Vindi is better because of the resists and regen. The PoE smithed stuff
is very good, but I think you'll find that getting the components for the
tempers is a massive pain in the arse. Elemental smithing in general is
pretty screwed up that way.

    She'll need her tailoring and smithing up close to 200 if I remember
right. In terms of farming, you'll need to kill geonids in WL for some no
drop gems, and you might have to farm velium hounds in WWastes. The hound
furs can be bought in The Bazaar, though, so you might duck that part.

    Naw, not really. There's three types of elemental tradeskill armour -
balanced, slanted HPs, and slanted MANA. In any given type of armour, two
sets are balanced, and one each is slanted HPs and slanted MANA. To use the
example I'm most familiar with, the tailored silk armours, the Air and Water
robes are each 90 HP/MANA (balanced), the Earth robe is 120 HP/50 MANA
(slanted HPs), and the Fire robe is 50 HP/120 MANA (slanted MANA). All the
pieces in a set will show that same type of bias.

    Earth plate is balanced. Balanced is just as good as any other type when
it comes to cleric armour. If anything, I'd avoid the two slanted sets
(Water and Fire) in favour of balanced when doing cleric armour. Mana is
useless if you're dead, and the big HP stuff is much better on plate tanks
than on a cleric. So if you can actually get the Earth tempers and make a
piece, I think she'd love it. Arms and gloves would be 60 HP/MANA pieces.

    Hard to tell, as we usually pull him when we're raiding Fire and he dies
within 30 seconds. I think he's just a red-con version of the guards from
the first castle. Should be VERY doable with one group, much the same way
the Obsidian Tree Spider Queen is (named in the field near zone-in).

    No, not the named demon guys. I'm pretty sure it's off a named imp, like
Sweating Imp or something like that. Bet Allakhazam's has the info.

    Her cloak has nice resists and gives her a permanent EB item, so I
didn't know if she wanted to mess with that. If she does, Hiero all the way.
There's a named frog in PoEarth that drops a nice cloak she could wear, too,
if you were willing to not pull tradeskill trees for a bit. ;-)
