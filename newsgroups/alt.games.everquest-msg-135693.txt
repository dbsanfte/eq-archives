sort of like a graphical MUD, only much much much much better.  The 
graphics in some zones will have your jaw dropping sometimes.  The MUDs 
wanna be EQ when they gow up.

BTW, the tutorial is lame and NOTHING like actually playing the game. 
It does tell you about a few things like turning in your guild note and 
needing food and a few other necessary things but alot of stuff is so 
far advanced from that 3 yr old tutorial that you won't even recognize it.

Make a character on Bertoxx, maybe we can hook up sometime.
