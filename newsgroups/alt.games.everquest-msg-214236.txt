Critical mass.  If enough people go "eh" and don't show up, then everyone
else ends up sitting there doing nothing.

I've done the thing where I spent my entire play session first scouting,
then begging people to gather for a raid on a contested target, then losing
it because we just didn't have enough.  Or when enough finally did come,
another group was already there.  It's not much fun for anyone.
