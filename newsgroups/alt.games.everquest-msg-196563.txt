I found it very easy to find mobs with no squabbling from 5 to 20, only over that point does
the zone tend to narrow down to bandit  camps or nothing.  Even then, on Morel Thule during
the day, there was little trouble getting in one or the other bandit camp groups, it probably
helped that we all seemed willing to share, even when three of us could handle the camp we'd
take up to a full group of whatever classes presented themselves.
