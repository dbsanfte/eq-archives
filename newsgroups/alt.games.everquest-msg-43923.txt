Basically, DAOC has no first person animations, and may never get them, at
least for a while. This does not bother me, as I have always much preferred
3rd person. However, the 3rd person animations are MUCH better and more
varied than EQ or AC. And the female jump animations are not near as lame as
the ones in EQ (geez, I always hated that...).
