Not at all.  Was referring to anyone who would think to disrupt power to 
the Sony site.  Especially anyone who would think to disrupt several 
thousands amps of power.  You are a victim of thread-drift.  It's a common 
event here.

Hacking != cracking.  A hack is an ingenious or clever way to solve a 
problem.  A hacker hacks.  A crack is unauthorized access or abilities.  A 
cracker cracks.  Hacker != Cracker.  Hack != Crack.
