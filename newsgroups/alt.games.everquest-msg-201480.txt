Hehe, I imagine that somewhere there is someone with that thought for
real. ;-)  I told my guild, and was congratulated, called a liar, and
shown much incredulity. 

I kind of got in this habit long ago when I would hand in Crushbone
belts one at a time to see if the quest had been left half finished.
That was around 1999 or so... and I stayed in the habit. You can't
imagine the number of final quest items I've handed in just to see
what happens.
