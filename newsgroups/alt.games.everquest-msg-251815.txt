Aye, it does have its uses, but it seemed very odd to have three group 
DS in a row and no single target DS in between.  Turns out Castersrealm 
was simply wrong, and the 61 group DS they list is really the logical 
single target DS.

I was just looking at this.  The jump in efficiency is really 
astonishing, PR is twice as efficient.  Its not twice as large, which is 
unfortunate, I'd sooner have seen a 500 mana heal for 2000, rather than 
dropping the mana back from 400 to 300 and stepping up only from 900 
heal to 1250 heal.  But what the heck, its bigger and cheaper at the 
same time.

And just spam that button?  Won't be able to do that while casting, so 
hit it between casts?  Maybe make a button that says
/pet back off
/pet kill
/cast 2, pause 70
/pet back off
/pet kill

I think I got that pause syntax wrong, but anyway, point would be to 
have the nuke button also remind the pet to keep on target.

Even with a decent earth pet, I found pet root to be largely useless, 
didn't stick well, short duration,  breaks when I nuke OR pet procs, 
didn't reliably use it when I might want him to.  Still, for this 
situation, breaking a single irritating pair, it might be worth using, 
if not for the fact that I'm two levels and a whole lot of cash or luck 
getting runes and handing them in away from having a useful earth pet.

Neither the DD bracer nor the DOT bracer, Rains are somehow not fish or 
fowl.  Still its likely that hitting two targets the efficiency is 
higher than using single target nukes.  Particularly since yes I am 
specialized in conjuration, but I'm using Firebolt (evoc) instead of 
Black Steel (conjuration) because its more DPS and seems to be a bit 
less aggro.
