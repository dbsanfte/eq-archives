    Well, I use maps too, i just dont like the idea of spending hours
drawing them myself, or having them on screen instead of the scenery while i
walk around... how dull... and the indicator of where you are on the map
will just encourage people to run around with the map as their view not the
real view..... can't see how it helps the game at all except makes it
easier... but we've been over this ;)
