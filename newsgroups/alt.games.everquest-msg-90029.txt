Or deeper in the dungeon, with a rez-enabled Cleric in the
group, "if you overpull, stay out there and let them kill
you, it's faster to rez one person than six".  

This may sound harsh, but it's quite often standard
operating procedure at higher levels, where a Cleric
rez results in very little lost exp.

We were raiding the Arena area in Kael a few weeks ago,
and lacking a Monk, we had a Warrior pulling.  I watched
as he accidentally got three named mobs, and he ran
out to a clear area, then just stood there.  I knew what
he was doing (letting himself die there rather bring
them all to the group), but what was really funny is
that just as he fell, we got:
     Muvil tells the group, 'DONT HEA"'

Lol -- struck down in mid sentence.
