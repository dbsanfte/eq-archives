From the shadows, the mysterious "Freeman"
<freeman@108dragon.clara.co.uk> (if that IS his real name)
conspiratorially whispered:

>Argent Protector is 42/49 +10AC. Much more damage in the hands of a 50+ (or
>even 40+) but not so hot to a low 20's character.

I dunno, that's what my warrior on test used (and uses) starting in
the mid-20s (there's that freakiy test economy for you again, I
*bought* it, and I'm not twinked in any way). You wouldn't believe how
easy fights were when you wipe out a third of a mob's hp in one swing.

Frankly once the damage cap is off at 20, those slow weapons work just
fine for doing the beatdown.
