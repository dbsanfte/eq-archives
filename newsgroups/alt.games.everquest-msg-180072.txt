Adding the perspective of another cleric (currently level 54...)

Incidentally, with 105 charisma or better you can buy peridots at 10 plat
5 gold each (and the price never gets lower). If you have poor charisma,
get a pair of opal-encrusted steins plus one or two other CHA items.

I usually add "slower" to the list of Symboled people, and like you,
don't usually Symbol myself. (If I get beat on, that's why I keep
Divine Aura up.) Sometimes the slower is also the chanter, but
sometimes it's a shaman.

What I've seen in PoP so far is that loot per MoB is either terrible or
great.
80% of MOBs drop nothing. 10% drop something worth maybe 10 plat. 10% drop
something worth 100 plat or more. This makes it *very* hard to split loot
fairly.

In many groups I find I'm the person looting *least*, which is utterly
infuriating. This happens because I often try to time my final CHeal for
the moment after the MOB drops, so if the tank is also pulling they can
do so without delay. Unfortunately the timing is frequently off by a second
or two and the resident uberlooter grabs the corpse when I don't dare
move. :-(

[ Snip info on Velks & loot splitting ]

I find that Velks is decent loot for a cleric. A reasonable group with a
loot
rotation will see a bunch of velium drop and a number of crushed/chipped
gems;
both sell for decent plat in bazaar, and the gems for decent, if less, cash
to vendors.

However, I agree most pickup groups have lousy loot splitting strategies.
That's partly my own fault I suppose. :-) Generally I'm willing to eat the
cost in a lot of cases rather than make much of a fuss, but I'm getting
less tolerant. I make more money from the shopping quest and vendor mining
than I do from groups lately.

The main problem bards have is that they have no mana regen to speak of,
and most mana regen boosters do not work for them. Their medding skill
maxes out at a single point. So while most of their songs use no mana,
the few that do are very "expensive" in terms of time between uses.

My brother plays a bard; they're extremely versatile. They can
substitute for a chanter to some extent (crowd-control wise), they
add DPS, they can pump mana with mana song (which stacks with each
bard!) and have a decent range of buff/debuff songs. And of course
if you want to go somewhere quickly and there's no portal nearby,
Selo's is great.

Ditto here. WIS up, then mana... I would probably have HP and AC around
the other way however. Another major consideration is focus effects.
And to some extent other effects (like EB, or the group heal on the
Thurg legs.)

Tanks having trouble keeping aggro is often the fault of the other
melees; many of the DPS classes seem to think that if the MOB starts
beating on them they should keep hitting, which is usually a bad idea,
since microheals chew through mana much more quickly than CHeal does.
Unfortunately many rogues & monks miss this point altogether.

This is very true. With KEI (cost: 50 plat) I can take down six MOBs an
hour rather than four (roughly speaking). Most undead don't drop huge
amounts of loot - say an average of 3 plat per MOB, unless you're very
lucky.
Over a four hour KEI that's 2x3x4 = 24 plat extra loot (72 plat total).

I find the level 53 (?) anti-undead DoT is better as I can root & rot, and
healing myself after the MOB is less of an issue as root is more likely to
stick.

Basically with a KEI I get somewhat less loot and somewhat better experience
over the same interval. However, donations from the occasional rez help
cover
the shortfall. My piddly 90 rez is usually not wanted however. :-)

In a Planes group I'm often expected to cover peridots *and* KEI out
of my own pocket. That's 80+ plat for a group. I've given up on KEI
for Planes groups, as I am *not* going to wear a 60-70 plat loss for
a group. If the group wants to pay for it, that's fine with me.
