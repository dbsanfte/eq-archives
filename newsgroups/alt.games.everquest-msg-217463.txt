Got a tell from someone establishing an LDoN group; once again
the old LFG on and LFG tool thing worked, I was blissfully
soloing my way thru 37 in OT and didn't have to lift a finger to
get the offer other than the ten seconds to put the two flags up.

Meet in EC, I'm told.  LD once on the way there, below par for
the course since LDoN.

Its Firiona Vie, so naturally the inviter is Anon.  Nonetheless,
we manage to get a group together somehow, I'm not quite clear
how when you can't tell anyone's class or level.

Then it becomes clear how; you just invite anyone at all who's in
the right level range.

Here's the group:

Mage
Shadowknight
Shadowknight
Bard
Bard
Warrior

Notice anything odd?

Undaunted (well the warrior was daunted, but easily cowed) we got
ourselves an exterminate mission, kill 50 mobs in 90 minutes, and
off we go.  I LD twice getting to the dungeon, we think for about
a minute and realize that we don't any of us have any buffs to
cast on each other, so we zone right in.  I LD zoning in, of
course.  Hook up with the party, which has moved in and done a
couple fights already, a bit beat up.

Then we procede to mow thru the whole dungeon, finishing our 50
mobs in 37 minutes, continuing on to kill every last mob in the
place for the exp and loot.  

Zero deaths, only two med breaks, both for one of the SKs, who is
doing a fair amount of casting apparantly.

The warrior, who's done nothing but complain the whole adventure
about the fact that everyone else is "roleplaying" leaves in
disgust afterwards, the rest of us get 45pp by waiting for the ML
to sell and split, plus we get a couple augments and an
SK/Paladin only 2hb that doesn't look half bad.

I can't even say we performed optimally; the bards rarely charmed
anything, which I know from experience is a great way to boost
DPS; mobs tend to hit better than PCs or "real" pets, plus the
mobs themselves get damaged making them easier to take down, its
like doubling that already high DPS if you can arrange for mobs
to fight each other for you.  

I wasn't at all necessary to the killing, if I sat down or
couldn't target a mob it fell just the same; what I was doing was
speeding us up by dropping nukes in on any mob that was living
long enough to take one or two; chopping a third or half their HP
out from under them quick, so they fell as fast as the lower
level mobs that simply werent' surviving at all.

It helped when the SK learned to tell us a few mobs in advance
when his mana was running low, then I'd burn even faster so as to
end up low on mana when we did sit down.

All in all, though, I was amazed that a no healers at all, no
buffs at all group could do so well.  Just goes to show what can
be done.

We replaced the warrior with a cleric and did another mission
just as easily, the cleric ended up nuking since healing was
rarely needed.  If it had been an undead mission we'd have really
cleaned up.

Then we did a "difficult" mission, which actually required us to
work, and DID depend on healing power.  We wiped due to a mob
somehow running away into trouble despite reportedly being
snared; either a fluke, a failed snare someone missed seeing, or
perhaps a fear/Instill Doubt before the "Running In Place (RIP)"
Point... ended up with 8 mobs in camp and the two bards weren't
well enough coordinated to handle the situation (two bards -can-
mez 8 mobs... if they can figure out which 4 each are taking). 
We still managed to complete the mission well within the time
limit, but the marginally higher rewards and the not noticably
higher exp were a dissapointment, as others have said before.

Splendid One, 38 Gnomage, Firiona Vie
