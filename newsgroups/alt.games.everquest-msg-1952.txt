}Secondly, if they deemed the SoV content to be only 1% of the CD space, you
}wouldn't complain?  Afterall, I'm sure the rest of the space they would fill
}up with "free" (as long as you buy the CD) games.

Heh, I don't care how much of the CD they used, I was just buying a CD
Key.  Then I'd get a nifty 'velious patch' button, and the amount of
expanded content would suddenly in no way be linked to the amount of space
the expansion takes up on the CD.  

On the other hand, the free games were, in my humble opinion, lame.  If
they hadn't come packaged with SoV, I wouldn't have wasted 1/2 an hour
installing them and trying them out.  I want my 1/2 hour back so I can
play EQ with it!

But then, I feel more ripped off by the soda machine down the hall that
just ate my dime.  Luckily, I can expense it. :)
