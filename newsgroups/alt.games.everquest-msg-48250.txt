actually, everyone's opinion is a piece of data
for me.  It helps to consider the source and their
possible biases.  For instance, many of the people
I've seen who really dislike DAoC are folks who
are also very knowledgeable and skilled at the
high end EQ game (Matt, for instance).  It doesn't
make their opinion worth more or less than anyone
else's, but it does put a different light on where
they are coming from.

There seem to be a large number of people
like me who got up to the 50+ game in EQ, and
found it to be no where near as much fun as
the earlier game.  We seem to have a more
positive impression of the game (DAoC).

Two possible interpretations -

1.  (best case) DAoC is more geared toward
the casual to medium committment player.

2.  (worst case) We simply didn't get high
enough to be disillusioned by the high level
content the way we have with EQ.

In either case, I'm not throwing out my EQ
account, the chance to keep my mage in the
sweet spot of level 51, while still developing
him (through the 51+ exp for abilities thing)
may give EQ a new lease on life for me.
