Believe me, I have researched a little before I started collecting the
biles,
on the web, I mean, and this is another tip I have known and I have tried
to see it - it was not visible.
I have dynamic lighting activated and the only explanation I have is that
for some reason on my system dynamic lighting doesn't work at all,
which is unlikely as none of the people with me was able to see the
glow, except maybe several times when we _believed_ the stuff glowed,
and when you believe you have a glowing wurm all the time, and finally
get a bile, then how on earth are you supposed to tell wether this time
it glowed just a little more or not? :*)

I have absolutely no idea.
