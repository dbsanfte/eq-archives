Hmm, have you ever lost a non-throwing item in your range slot by throwing
it?

Whenever I have had my totem or ball of velium in range (uber nuke and
resists you know!! heh) and forgot to switch them with shurikens and pressed
throw, I've never accidently thrown the items.

The ball of velium is nodrop, but the totem isn't.
