Personally, my rogue got very bored very quickly with the Feerott.  
After I created a ranger and got her up to about level 10, it got MUCH 
easier, and much more productive.  But without tracking, I couldn't find 
enough of the damn things, even if they are bright yellow, and they drop 
less, in my experience, than the ones in the east commons newb area 
drop.

I will have to try FoB now though, what with it being so easy to pop 
over to.
