Do you know if there are any requirements for the EQIM program that
I may have missed? I cannot get it to work. Every time I try logging in I
get an "Invalid Login" error message. I've uninstalled, downloaded,
reinstalled. I've checked my typing, caps, etc, *thoroughly* and tried
it *many* times. I am using the same name and pwd as in EQ. I never
get past the login itself. I've tried it from home and at work. I am using
ZoneAlarm but I have no trouble running EQ through it. And yes,
I have tried disabling the firewall. EQ itself works fine. I have many
characters. I've recently uninstalled and reinstalled EQ itself to see if
it would help. It didn't. I'm running W2K with the latest version of
everything. Do you have any suggestions please?
