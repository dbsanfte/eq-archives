I'm not a dog trainer, and I don't particularly find it's my position to 
go around dealing painful lessons. I value a reduction of the stupidity 
level, don't get me wrong, but I find it more valuable to contribute to 
an increase of the overall courtesy level.

And why not?

Well, if I find a bag of gear on the ground, I assume it belongs to 
someone who was drop-twinking, even if I missed the message, or even if 
there was no message. You must concede that, given the attitude of some 
players, most people who are getting ready to drop-twink have a good 
reason to not warn the zone.

Actually, it's the only practical option most of the time for characters 
who are unguilded or have no friends online at the moment. The proof of 
this is that a lot of people do it in spite of the risks (not only from 
other players, but even from the item poofing if they can't log back in 
in time).

Certainly. And yet you did it, and I bet you were glad nobody took it. 
And I would bet you'd have been grateful --if, say, you had had trouble 
reconnecting and it took you five minutes instead of two-- to find 
someone there who would hand you the stuff back rather than keep it.

Again, I beg to disagree. Sorry. If I find a FBSS on the ground, I find 
it a lot easier to think "someone will pop in a few minutes to pick it 
up, and they will be well pissed off if it's gone" than "Oh! Verant must 
have *really* messed up the ground spawn table in North Freeport. Lucky 
me".
