Whats wrong with trying to sell my game?  If you look on ebay and type PC
games in the search you will find thousands of others trying to sell a game
too.  I guess were all morons :P


You're charging more than $60 for the software, aren'tcha? Hmm? Yup,

Again, I can not justify what people want to buy, or how much they buy it
for...

Keep em comming...
