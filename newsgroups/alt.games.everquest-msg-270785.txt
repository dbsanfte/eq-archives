Oh, so do I.  But I thought we were talking about in-game friends, not
every variety of friend one might have.

I have friends that I can do stuff with, without constantly asking
either of us to go out of our way.  Part of what makes us friends is
that, when necessary, we will go out of our way;  another part is that
we avoid asking each other too unless it's really necessary.

Now, folks who make me feel like I have to keep up (ie constantly go
out of my way) in order to do things with them aren't exactly what I'd
call friends.  Nor, I suppose, would folks who make me feel like I
have to slow down in order to do things with them.

Taken to gaming levels:  I'd have a hard time staying friends in-game
with a powerleveler, simply because we'd never be able to do much
together (other than chat) without one of us feeling dragged along -
either me to the powerlevelling games, or her to... whatever you'd
call playing without powerlevelling.  It's not fair to me, and it's
not fair to her.

Indeed.  I prefer friends I can have fun with over friends I can have
fun at the expense of.

I think you're just misunderstanding me.  Which isn't surprising;  I'm
mimicking someone who is also often misunderstood, and I'm fairly
certain now that it is his presentation.  

I will admit to one conceit, however;  I don't have much respect for
people who are willing to bore themselves to tears for faster gain.
Purely a personal opinion of course, but there it is.
