Nope.  It does have a -50 resist adjust tho, so the complainants are
probably irritated at having what seemed to be a "sure thing" fail.
Or maybe they're just d00ds who hold the opinion that Paladins ought
to be gods rather than serving them, who knows?  I know that sounds
a bit harsh, but we're talking about a ninth spell (AA hotkey, no
gem required) that costs no mana and works on higher level mobs than
any other stun I know of.  Seems like a mighty nice ability to me,
I'm looking forward to having it eventually.
