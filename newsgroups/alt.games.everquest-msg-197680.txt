Stop thinking about my slide rule, dammit!  :)

One problem I have with the "practical experience" approach is that it is 
based on human tolerance and reaction. I'm sorry, but I've seen examples 
time and again in the online community where people take advantage of the 
fact that they are dealing merely with other online personas and have 
less trouble "bailing" on them and such. We have no way of knowing how 
much of that entered into the disolution of these guilds and reluctance 
to give more to the cause.

I'm not saying anyone in particular behaved in this way. I'm just saying 
that it is very possible and you can't control it. Therefore, it is an 
unknown factor when dealing with a guild in the throes of trial attempt 
status.
