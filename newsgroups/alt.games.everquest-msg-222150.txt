Hope Furor used up his capital with Sony getting Monks nerfed, now no
one should seriously listen to him.

The problem is the game itself is totaly flawed. Too many classes not
enough jobs pure and simple. Sony addmitted this, when in the upcoming
EQ2 , decided to go to the skills based char model instead of the
heavy class based one of EQ. Knight classes would only exist as
subsets of the Warrior class. Otherwise there is no solution that
doesnt leave someone out in the cold. Course that never stopped them
before has it?
