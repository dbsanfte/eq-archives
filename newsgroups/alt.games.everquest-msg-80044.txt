I'm sticking in zero into AA until 60. 

My group wants better rezzes that I can give at higher levels. And I
have this insane idea that maybe I can reach 60 in 60 days played.

The one AA thing that caught y eye was the mana free 100% rez. But since
this is available once every 72 hours /played time, it ain't worth it to
shoot for ASAP.
