I know--that's how we were able to get a package deal on ours <g>

	More of it, though, is caused by the strictures placed on
adoptions themselves--strict rules about termination of parental
rights (hard to do when the parents can't be found), age of parents,
marital status of parent[s], number of children in the home, and the
now slightly unpopular belief that a child must be placed with parents
who match all physical attributes of the child (as though a
differently colored parent is worse than no parent at all.)
