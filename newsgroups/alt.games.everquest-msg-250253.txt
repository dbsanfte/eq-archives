No doubt I'll be branded an apologist for not immediately jumping
in with fire and brimstone, but they said as much after the last poll. The
question was, I think, "haven't we made ourselves clear enough?" - this
is on the official messageboards. Brenlo I think responded with "yes, we
know what you think but a lot of our players don't use the messageboard
and we want to see weather they feel the same". They went on to say
there were no plans to offer it as yet, but then I think I read that 70% of
their GM time at the moment is researching scams, which makes me think
the motivation for doing it is a little more concrete than they are letting
on.

I think I would have a very hard time continuing if they did allow it.
I'd probably take my money elsewhere at that point just to not be
condoning it.
