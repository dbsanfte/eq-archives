Just got done reading this long (29 page) guide.  Very interesting.  I'd
like some comments on certain aspects of it though.

1) His Combat Value formula for gear.  He holds that one point of AC equals:

One point of STR
15 HP
6 DEX
6 AGI
5 STA
5 on saves
1% of Haste (2 AC = 2% of Haste)

INT, WIS, CHA, and charges are worth nothing.

He wrote his formula as:

CV = AC + STR + (total of HP, DEX, AGI, STA, and save bonuses) + % haste.

Wouldn't actually the formula, given the conversion table above, be the
following:

CV = (AC + STR + % haste)/1 + HP/15 + (DEX +AGI)/6 + (STA + save)/5

And what do people think of his AC conversion table for warriors?

2) Best player-made jewelry for warrior gives +6 AC and +65 HP.  It's a
ring.  Has anything better come out?  Given the above CV formula.

3) Is there a way to make a macro to quick switch gear?  I'd like to, say,
have a backpack of regen gear that I can click a hot key and have my warrior
quick change into.  The macro would also sit my warrior.  Click on the
button again and I switch to my combat gear and stand.  Anyone know how this
or something close to this could be done?  I would have this instead of a
plain Sit key.

4) Lastly, by reading his guide, you get the impression that warriors are an
underpowered class.  However, in numerous threads in this newsgroup,
warriors are the one of the two preferred classes (cleric being the other)
for at least raids, if not all groups.  Or did I read something wrong in the
guide?
