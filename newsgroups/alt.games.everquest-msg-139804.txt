No the funny thing is that I posted my terms and conditions for
acceptance of your offer for a face to face meeting and you scurried
away to hide behind some sort of IRC game you play where you mute others
and pretend you can't hear them.  Sort of like a child with fingers
stuck in the ears saying "lallalalalala I can't hear you" hehe.  Well I
guess that was one funny thing, the fact that you dare to call me
cowardly after scurrying so fast the last time I accepted your offer is
pretty funny too.  Face  it, you are a man who likes to listen to
himself talk and nothing  more.  You are incapable of comprehending what
others say to you or the fact that your own words bear witness against
you.  You have been bested again and again and yet return to claim
victory.  It would only be funnier if it wasn't so sad.
