Don't bother going unless Radir/Tawro/Gantru Dralkenr or some other nameds
are up, kill them for 12 ac 15 stat 6 sv all bracers and some other loot.

Be warned that int caster (Dream Weaver) gear is crappy, though the robe
might be an upgrade for some people.  Shojen armor (clr/shm) is poo that
isn't worthy of a level 12 twink though.

Dark Master armor (rng/brd/rog) is decent, Dark Assassin (rng/brd/rog also)
is slightly less useful, but still ok if you're wearing crap.

Raldukan armor (war/brd/clr/sk/pal) is nice.

Kill disturbed Elysians for yourself (druid only armor, BP is 24 ac 15 str 5
sta 15 wis 15 hp 75 mana 8 sv all, legs are 16 ac 15 sta 7 wis 10 int 50 hp
10 sv cold)  Soloable at 53.  Corrupted Elysian Elders are harder than
disturbed (cast 49+ druid spells, summon, level 58) but drop Death Mask of
the Elysians, Death Watchers Shroud and RARE Glimmering Statuette, which are
all nice (mask is all/all face, shroud is clr/dru/shm shoulder, statuette is
nec/wiz/mag/enc range)

Like Martin said, you can probably kill anything except Rumblecrush and
Doomshade (doomshade can spawn if you kill all 4 Dark Masters fast enough
and he's "up"), I don't know if Zelnithak is doable for you though (it's the
big horse), Just be ready for the AEs (buff disease and magic), he's not too
bad in terms of damage output though he does have a lot of hp, he also
enrages, as does most of the zone.  If you do go after Zelnithak, you (at
level 50) will probably either die or be a mana drain for healing, just
because of the level difference on AE resists.
