His 'memory album' movie is better though. Not really funny but you
can see how much heart he put into it. Seeing his guild/org go from
wiping to Derakor to posing in front of the statue in Aten Ha Ra's
room in Vex Thal, and the dead PoP gods...

For funny movies I'll always go with the gnome danceoff....
