Thank you for understanding and more eloquently describing what
I was trying to do!  I think that I need to write at a 2nd grade
level in this group as concepts like analogy are lost on most
of the people who argue the most.

Again, well said and further demonstrating that you read for context,
not literal content.  BTW, I hope my writing *isn't* that hard to
understand :^)  I got A's all through college in anything writing
oriented, although I must admit that I rarely draft, proof, and
revise stuff that I post here -- it's all just top-of-my-head stuff...

Mike
