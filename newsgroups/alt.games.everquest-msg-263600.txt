WHoa there Nellie; back that up a little.

Guy makes 100k, has NO DEDUCTIONS (or do you mean he makes 150K but his
deductions turn it into a reported 100K?).

Now he pays 28% of that 100K plus 7.75% for SS, fine.  He has 64.25K
remaning. Assuming he spends it All on taxable goods at your astounding
12% (in PA, AZ, MA, and TX, all areas I spend weeks or months each year,
the amount is very close to 6%... dunno where this 8-12 figure you are
getting comes from) then he pays 12% of 64.5K, or  7.71% of that 100K
figure, NOT 12% of it.  Taking your assumptions at face value thats
still at most  43.46%.

But he's probably going to have a number of deductions (mortage
payments, medical bills, etc) so lets assume his taxable income is
closer to 75K. 28% of this is only 21K.  Of course he's still on the
hook for the whole 7.75k SS tax, oddly enough.  Then he's going to spend
a sizable chunk of his income on food and clothing and services, which
in most states means no sales tax.  And my experience suggests that he's
likely looking at 6% sales tax on the items he -is- paying on.  Say he's
still a spendthrift who blows half his pay on taxable items, saving
nothing at all; 50K (I'm assuming his real pay, not his adjusted income,
just to be crazy generous to you) at 6% is 3k.  He's looking at 21K plus
7.75K plus 3K, or 31.75K, which is 31.75% of his pay, a far cry from
your 50% figure.

A better guess would be about 25% of his pay, assuming he's both
responsible moderately intelligent.

Now, how much of that amount is going to service (just paying the
interest) on the national debt?  Borrowing more money in order to give
him $600 back (out of the 25K he's paying, mind you, less than 1% of his
tax load) makes no sense at all... but GW just signed his fourth
consecutive tax giveaway bill.

Again, relatively small change, the big ticket items for the average guy
making 100k are the ones you already named, income, SS, sales tax, in
declining order of painfulness.

Penny wise, pound foolish doesn't help either.  If you cut military
waste by 1% you'll save more money than the entire food stamp program.
If you cut the debt load by 1%, how much money do you save off just
servicing the debt?

In the meantime, the food stamp program is feeding american citizens who
would otherwise be starving to death.  Its not letting them live in
anything approaching luxury, its just letting them live.  At a certain
point, I'm unable to let people starve to death no matter how foolish I
think they've been in letting themselves get to that point.

Hiring someone doesn't do anything.  They have to produce, so that
wealth is created.  Unless you mean that Joe Millionaire is going to
hire them and pay them out of his pocket with no income, until
eventually he runs completely out of money and goes on the dole himself?

No, he hires someone who produces $200k in wealth, takes half for
himself and pays that guy the rest (assuming he's generous, most
employers pay a lot less than 50% of what the guy produces), making
himself wealthier, not poorer.

Wow, a Rush fan in our midst!  There aren't enough jobs in this country
paying 100k a year to cover everyone.  Some jobs pay 50K or 30K or 20K.
  Work long hours at a 20K job and you end up with 25K a year.  While
you might eventually dig yourself out of that hole by saving up the
extra 5K, its going to take a long time... in the meantime, you're still
living on 20K.

If the poverty level is 20K a year, then the guy making 10K a year isn't
making enough to live on.  He could use a hand.  How about the guy who's
making 100K a year and paying 25K?  Well he's in the same boat as your
buddy making 10M and... no wait, I can't swallow that one.  Show me a
guy who is making 10M a year in real money (not 100M that deductions
reduce to 10M) and paying 4M and I'll bite.  Is he spending most of it
on hotel rooms, so he can pay a higher sales tax on it?  Does he not
realize he could invest most of that 10M in ways that would take it out
of the income entirely, and still have plenty to live as luxuriously as
he likes?
