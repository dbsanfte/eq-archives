I'll drink to that.

Life's to short to worry about whether a character name is a brand
name in some country or other.

To be honest, I don't feel that it is my responsibility to report
those characters. Players who breach the terms and conditions by
having a character name that conflicts with copyright or trademake
laws are Verants problem.

They do not effect me in the slightest. 

Even stupid names don't bother me. Within reason they can help to make
a character moore memorable. I have played two Troll warriors, one
called Bignows and one using the random name generator. By the time I
had reached 15th level, when Bignows was on line players were sending
me tells asking me if I wanted to group. They had grouped with me
before, and said that the name was memorable and they remembered how
good I was to group with. The other character never got anything like
that, even though I played the same way with both, sometimes with the
same players.

I would make an exception for obscene names, and to be honest I
haven't seen anything like the number of foul names that I saw in
Ultima Online. The fact that Verant do have a policy, and seem to be
reasonably mature about enforcing it shows more interest in the game
world than Origin (I think) did with UO.

What is Verants policy about petitions? Do they wait until they have
had a number of complaints before they force a name change, or can any
peon with a grudge force a name change?
