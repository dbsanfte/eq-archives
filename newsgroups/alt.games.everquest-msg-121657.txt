That's a common bit of folk etymology - that people in mediaeval times
accused of adultery would be put in the stocks or whatever with "For
Unlawful Carnal Knowledge" on boards above their heads.  Later this was
shortened to the acronym.  There's also another similar explanation which
has the meaning as "Fornication Under Consent of the King".

Both these are reasonable enough stories (although I can't actually see a
meaning in the second one, it doesn't make much sense - why would the King
consent to fornication?), but they are just stories.  The word has come to
English through Germanic, Anglo-Saxon and Old English, but nobody really
knows where it started out.
