I won't repeat the other's answers.  Let me just say that as a rogue with an
Evade skill, I can evade to my hearts content and I will NEVER drop off the
hate-list.
This was even on the class talks where it was requested that if the rogue
can successfully get out of agro range that she might have a small chance of
evading completely (ie Mem Blur or FD where mob forgets you).  Since rogues
(yes, and WAR) have no escape mechanism whatsoever (SoW/Selo, MemBlur, Gate,
FD, Evac) this didn't seem like such a bad idea.
