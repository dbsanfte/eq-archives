Ah, but that *is* part of the problem. =P People who don't bother to get a
bind (because they don't feel they have time to waste to find one) are the
same people who make druids and wizzies and clerics go anon (because chances
are if you don't have patience to find a bind, you likely don't think you
should have to waste your time making that long, nasty CR when you inevitably
die.)

"Hi, I know I'm a complete stranger; but I just died in <A_remote_zone01> and
I'm bound in <insert someplace a boat ride or two and a long run away here>.
Can you drop what you are doing to port me? What do you mean you're on a guild
raid deep in <insert high level dungeon name here>? So what if you are the
only healer in your group? Can't they manage without you for 10 min. or so?
I'm dead! It's for a CR! What kind of asshole are you anyway? It's your *job*
to port me."  Me: "Um, the kind of asshole who doesn't leave their friends
and/or guildmates stranded in a high level dungeon without a healer/evacer?
And no, it's *not* my job to port you; I pay my $10 per month to play, same as
you do. I do not work for Verant; I am not a GM. If you want to have port on
demand, I suggest you make a druid or a wizzy. Your poor planning does not
constitute an emergency on my part, sorry. Good luck with the CR." /ignore
halfwit Yes, I have actually had this conversation on more than one occasion
(nearly every time I play unless I am /anon or /role, truth be told) and I do
not doubt for an instant that clerics get the same and worse. It's positively
amazing the number of people who will get downright abusive when you are
unable to assist them.

I, for one, think the autobinders are a great idea; my only complaint is that
they should be in *every* bindable zone. I always felt bind should be a
command (/bind) rather than a spell anyway. It is a necessary thing, after
all, unless you plan on inconveniencing others when you die and, let's face
it, that's going to happen from time to time. Now I can say, "Sorry, but it's
your own fault you didn't get a bind. I can't help you at the moment." with a
completely clear conscience.
