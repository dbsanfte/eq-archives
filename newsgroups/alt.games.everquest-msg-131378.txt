the higher of the two.

Haste stacks... but only across types.

There are three types of Haste

Item Haste
Spell Haste
Song Haste

You will only see the effect of your highest item's haste
You will only see the effect of one spell haste.  This
will stack with item haste.  Most bard haste songs count
as spell haste and do not stack haste effect with other spell
haste, despite giving you their icon and stat effects.
Some high level bard haste songs are "song haste" and stack
haste effect with spell haste.

Some items "proc" spell haste, which then stacks with
regular item haste (and not with other spell hastes) and
there are even some items which proc song haste (which
would then stack with both spell and item haste)

There is a Cap limiting the total haste you can recieve,
except that certain bard haste songs (high level ones mind you)
allow you to excede this haste cap

Llyric, 40 bard (well under the "stacks with spell haste" song level)
