Lots of changes includes: level cap to 70, stats cap raised as well,
new gears and new spells, new bugs, (old bugs are still there though)
etc.  There is simply too much you should consider going to eq forum
at eqplayers.com and familarize with current issues.

As for moving, I think you can only move for free within 1 month from
merges so you are likely stuck on your current server.  But since you
haven't played for a while you probably don't have any reason to move
yet.

Part of the reason traffic dropped here on usenet is because there are
eq forums and many class specific forums like beastlords.org (not sure
about yours check around)

If you are serious on coming back, get the Titanium package you will
catch up to all but PoR for only $20.  I'd hold off getting PoR until
you refamiliarize with your characters and play styles.  Older
expansion are easier as they have been played more throughly and most
people can handle a rusty player or 2 while PoR is just a month old
and not many have figured out the strategy yet to handle all of the
zones and mobs.
