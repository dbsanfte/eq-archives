But much, much easier to obtain (compare the quest list above to the
quest "Go to Eastern Wastes/Crystal Caverns and kill Ry'gorr, loot the
armor from their dead bodies" or "Go to East Commons tunnel and /auc
"WTB Ry'gorr"). Ry'gorr armor will also be have a wider potential
customer pool (all chain and plate classes, not just paladins) when
you're ready to move on to new armor later. 

If you own a weapon with a proc, and strength isn't a problem for you
(as a dwarf, I imagine that it isn't), you will probably prefer Ro
gauntlets to Ry'gorr gloves, for the Dexterity bonus.
