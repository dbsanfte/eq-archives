No no, she likes Diablo 2, for instance, it's the motion sickness
that keeps her from the game.

Yuk, that bobbing drives me crazy sometimes. I press F9 a couple times
if I have to have levitate on. It isn't nearly as noticeable then.

Well, summer's just around the corner. And even chemical engineers
have to have holidays, so there should be some openings as summer
interns Real Soon Now. And if you perform well in that kind of
position, who's to say you won't get a contract at the end of summer?

Hehe, I see a lot of mangled Norwegian on that channel, if it's
the same one I watch. NRK2? Not that the slang and spelling is
any better on IRC, either...

All right, I'll get around to it next time I'm online.

Kr.sand, actually. See, I told you the values got stupid large.
Blame my faulty memory for that one.

Ok, sow plz! Also, I need a port! Although considering your schedule
compared to mine, we'll probably never see eachother. Look for a big
ugly troll named Kagrab.

And I don't mind halflings, or even halfling druids (one of my best
EQ friends is a halfling druid), it'sjust that there are so many of
them, the chances of running into an asshole halfling dr00d are so
high.

Wow, did that sound stupid or what? "One of my best friends is a
halfling". I sound like a racist defending his views... Oh my god,
maybe I am?
