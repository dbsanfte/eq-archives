I think the "fix" is to get rid of the defensive disc for warriors.
Warriors should keep their DPS as if they are not using defensive but
automatically take less damage as if they were using the defensive
discipline all the time.  The ability should start at the level the
warrior now gets defensive and scale up; perhaps give the warrior a
"mana" bar showing him how long until this defense advange runs out.
Time med breaks with melee breaks; weapons & armor labled for all
melees would not be de-facto"hybrib only" gear just because it had
mana.  When the warrior uses the offensive disciplines, the warrior's
mitigation would drop back to the present standard.  Groups would have
to decide whether they want the warriors to hold aggro by using
offensive disciplines or move at a steady/slower pace that makes
healing a warrior much easier than for the other tanks.  

Just my 2 cents about how they should be fixed.
