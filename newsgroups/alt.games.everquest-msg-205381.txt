That is correct.  The skeleton you can outrun easily on land with
SoW will quickly overtake you in the water, nevermind his lack of
bouyancy and fleshy surfaces to push with, your 200 swimming skill
and SoW are no match for him (wonder if a Bard can outswim a mob?).
Generally, unless you are forced to be in the water (Kedge Keep,
for instance, or to kill an underwater quest mob), you are far
better off out of it (no doubt there's an exception or two, but I
haven't run across one).
