There are tons of these host places. They are a bit
expensive for what you need though.

My idea of the BEST one is

www.magelo.com

They cater to EQ, interface with his 
magelo character inventory site, etc. I don't know if its live yet or
still in beta. Don't remember if he had email also. Sounded pretty 
nifty to me though I never tested it.

Since the site is just for your own GUILD, the easiest thing
to do would be to just get an ezboard. Its free even with tons of
visits, people can post pics from their own free site space/web space,
etc. Most of the people in your guild probably have ezboard accounts
already for other boards, making it easy.
