Ok, this is all off the top of my head from my history of bow owning - I
dont trawl equipment websites and whathaveyou so I could be wrong,
but....

Wind saber is bettered by most droppable bows out there in the high
end game. The worst of the Dragon Necropolis bows is better, the bow
of the udnerfoot from the hole is better (I recall), the bow of the
huntsman from kael quest/hunting is better.

Windsaber aint a good bow. Nice and fast for practice, though.
