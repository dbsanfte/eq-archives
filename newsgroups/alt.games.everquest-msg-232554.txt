Most people seem to go with regen 3.  If you have a horse or drogmor, then 
innate metabolism 3 is quite handy.  Otherwise, put them wherever, none of 
the possibilities make a big difference.  3 points in Innate Wisdom will 
raise your wisdom by a whopping 6 points.  You could go for stamina and get 
a few extra hp out of it, if you stamina is not typically maxxed out.  
Personally, I did run 3, regen 3, then later metabolism 3 when I got my 
horse.
