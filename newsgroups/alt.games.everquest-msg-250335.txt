See, that might actually be reasonable.  If it enabled us to positively 
identify ebayers, hey, big plus.  But that'd probably also put a huge dent 
in sales and make it not worth it from SOE's point of view.

When that poll came up, I had to actually think about it pretty hard.  
Because as much as I disapprove of ebaying, I -do- approve of people who 
quit handing their account to a guildie or friend to take care of on the 
odd chance they might come back.

What if, I thought, they could somehow arrange it so you could only 
transfer an account to someone who already had an account?

But then I decided that was too hard and they'd find some way to screw it 
up, so I voted no.
