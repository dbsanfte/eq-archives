To alt.everquest newsgroup:

First, I would like to apologize for my 13 year-old daughter's little
rampage here on this news group.  Unfortunately for me, I know very little
about the Internet, computers, and least of all about news groups, so I had
no idea that she had used my email accounts to post these messages.  Of
course, this was after she lost the one I used for my MSN Instant Messenger.

What I do know is that my little daughter came to me about an hour ago
scared that someone was coming after her.  In today's society it takes a lot
to scare a teenager, as they are going through adolescence and sometimes
think they know more then their parents, so I was quite distraught when she
came to me crying.  So I looked at the 3 posts that she started to find out
what made her jump to that conclusion, and gratefully I did not find
anything that portrayed a threat her life.

What I did find though, were some of you who called yourselves adults,
rampaging far worse then she did.  And what I find even more pathetic is
that this is over Everquest's Users License Agreement, a GAME, which I am
one hundred percent positive that none of you work for Verant or Sony, for
if you did, you would have handled yourself in a much more appropriate
manner.  So not only were rampaging like a child, but over something that
didn't directly concern you.  In fact, only 1 or 2 of you actually replied
to her posts in a civil manner, most of you acted like children fighting
over a cookie jar, and the rest portrayed themselves like Verant's
attorneys.

As for Everquest's Users License Agreement, the first 2 were in violation of
the agreement.  For that, she has lost her game as it is now uninstalled on
her computer.  The last post was totally in agreement with the Everquest's
Users License Agreement, but most of us know that what is legal may not
always be what is ethical.

My fatherly advice to most of you kids: Mind Your Own Business.  This was
obvious a child's post, so the grownup thing to do would be to ignore it,
not scare the poop out of a little girl.

Sincerely,

Cprince
