Ok so I got the game installed and started playing last night.

6hrs later I finally went to bed :-)

Loving everything so far but there's still a fair number of issues that have 
got me confused.

1. Having read a post below about it being a good idea to get your 
'Forresting/Mining/Fishing/Gathering' stats upto 40 before you leave the 
newbie Island I set out to do this.

My problem is that my stats read like:

Fishing 23/26
Forresting 18/26
Gathering 23/26
Mining 16/26

I thought that I could spend a few hours just fishing but this doesnt seem 
to be the case. I presume I cant increase one stat to 40 and leave the rest 
as they are?

2. My other problem is I spent 2silver on a 'basic fishing rod'. I thought 
this would be better than the standard one that I got but it seems exactly 
the same. Was this a mistake?

3. My other problem is with the chat screen. Is it possible to filter it so 
I only see messages to myself and stats for fights i'm in? At the moment the 
text is whizzing up the screen and displaying info on all fights around me.
