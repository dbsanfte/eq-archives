This happens often when people naive about
internet inner workings answer a spam post
(to put it down :-)

That's why I have just suggested on r.g.c.m.
to create a "robot" for each of the discussion
groups. Such a "robot" would check the incoming letters
for occurences of the key words peculiar to the given
group. If key words would not be present often enough
(say one in evey 4kb) then the letter would not show
on the internet. This, at a small price, would slow down
spamming.
