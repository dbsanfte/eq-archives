Any "I, II, III, etc." items don't stack.  Just like haste, the best one
you're wearing is in effect.  Any "%" items stack (*except* haste,
obviously), so spell shield, dot shield, etc. stack (up to a certain cap). 
Any "number" items stack (avoidance, strikethrough, accuracy) up to a
certain cap.

The cap for a lot of the percentage items, if not all, is 35%.  I don't
think the other caps are known yet (and would be a helluva lot hard to
figure out).
