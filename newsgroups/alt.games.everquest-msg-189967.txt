I was always poor with the /loc in that it took me time to sit down and
work out what my movement went so I could only run instinctively in zones
I explored (but at least I did explore). Also as a ranger I could readil
track a known NPC and manoeuvre that way.

When they introduced that little compass then I did take much more notice
simply becuase high sense heading made it stay still and useable.
