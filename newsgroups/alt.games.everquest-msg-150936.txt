Just do what I do, set up two Socials (I named mine H Set and L Set for High
settings and low settings) with /showspelleffects off/on respectively and
whatever else little nifty things you want in or out.  I hit the low set and
go into overhead view before even thinking about zoning into the bazaar.
And I get NO lag.  Or at least nothing really noticeable.
