Yes I know what happened in the Second World War.
I feel that someone who is a slave to the rules, and insists everyone
sticking to the rules, even against popular opinion, may, with
justification, be compared to the Nazis. It does not mean that I am saying
that these people invaded Poland, or persecuted the Jews.
This is whats know as an analogy (a-nah-luh-jee)
Calling someone a Judas for being a traitor...is that insensitive?
You do realise what happened in the Bible, dont you?
