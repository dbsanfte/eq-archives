I am hoping some of you wizard players out there will have some suggestions
for INT items for a HIE wizard in the following slots:

Arms
Shoulders
Feet

 Was thinking about eboots, but it's just that at the moment, a
consideration. I am pretty much satisfied with all the other gear I have
right now, my total INT is 179, I know that isn't *that* high, but this
being my main (and basically my only character that I play at all), I have
to save up the plat to upgrade any old equipment.  The three slots above are
the only ones in which I don't have +stats equipment, and advice on those
would be greatly appreciated.
