This is just a word of warning not to trust anyone.. even people you think
are friends.. I came back from
a 2 year break from EQ.. I traded all my gear to a new account because I
didn't want to start playing my Mage
again and started up a Rogue had about 300K after my Mage, and old clerics
gear was sold and started over..

Twinked up a rogue, had a friend join me and I was back to loving the game
like I had when I first played. My
buddy decided he wanted to start a warrior so I decided to roll up a Shaman
and play it with my buddy as
I figured together we would be able to duo quite well.

I had joined a guild along with my buddy along the way and was trying to
trade my rogue gear over to
Shaman so I could get him equiped, my buddy wasn't on so I got a guildmates
mule, I give them my platinum
and gear to trade to my Shaman and poof, the guy logs, unjoins the guild and
there goes my equipment.

I understand I didn't make the wisest choice but I tend to be a trusting
person since I had hung out and hunted with
this guy etc..

Boy to people's character disapoint me sometimes.. I petitioned and after 24
hours its now been handed to
a Senior CSR.. haven't got a response yet.. =(  *sigh*

Becareful who you trust and wish me luck..

Jeff
