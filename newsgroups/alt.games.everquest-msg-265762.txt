Which is quite sensible, since necromancers are inherently evil, at
least in a world where bringing the dead back to serve you is
considered evil.  A wizard, OTOH, can serve Freeport just fine, since
they're not considered inherently good. Why conjurers are inherently
good is a mystery to me, but I'm not conversant with the lore.

How does it defeat the archetype system?  The point of the archetype
system is that any class/subclass from an archetype should be able to
fill that archetype's role in a group, which for mages is to do lots
of damage, to help regen power, and offer a little crowd control.  As
long as all subclasses can do this, I don't see how alignment has
anything to do with this, since no matter your alignment you can
always play any given archetype and class.
