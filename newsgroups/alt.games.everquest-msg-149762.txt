They *are* fun, but only:

1. After they partially fixed wizards in the class balancing and added
the new Luclin options for them

and 

2. After you're able to twink them up a bit, particularly with jboots
and TFlux staff at the earlier levels.

Without those givens, though, they are still a huge PITA to play. Even
with them, it's a rough road at times, and they still don't truly shine
until they hit 59 and 60. But at least you've got something to shoot
for.
