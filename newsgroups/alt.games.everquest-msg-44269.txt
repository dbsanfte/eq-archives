Ah, I see what you mean.

Never having seen anyone, of any class, LFG in Chardok or Sebelis, it never
occurred to me that you wanted to.  Yep, would be a nasty surprise if it was
empty.  Normally people LFG for those zones do so in KC, or via tells.

I suppose there would be more action there if there was a way to go and
LFG there, or more likely to -stay- there and LFG when your first group
disbands.

Its such a long walk without a porter to evac you halfway there, that I'm
not really planning to go without one even if getting in and out to LFG
isn't hard.
