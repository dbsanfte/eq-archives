yes.

It is because the game is designed as a huge timesink where
playing "right" causes you to get punished. You get mired in downtime
for doing things like trying to find groups. A person with a warrior
character spends two hours during an evening's play session just
trying to get a group, never getting one. This is NOT a fun game to
play (at least not playing it that way) At this point the person has
several choices:

1) lump it, perhaps become more of a social butterfly 
and really work at making friends to always group with. 
This is pretty hard if your time is limited and its greatest
flaw is that it is dependant upon the actions of others.

2) start a soloing class. This is really the most viable
choice with the game's design. My 56 druid can log on
and at least accomplish something, without ever looking
for a group. Or it could feel like grouping and try for 5 minutes
then go do something else.

3) Start a grouping class but a much more requested one, either
a cleric or an enchanter.

4) quit, find a game that better suits the way you want to play.

I've been messing around with Anarchy Online again, its incredibly
improved from the way it was at release (far more than EQ improved in
that same amount of time after release) I like things about it like
its zero downtime design and ability for anyone to at least zero
downtime solo when they can't group for what is basically negative
downtime.

5) mulibox it and stay in EQ. Honestly this is really the optimal way
to do it, though the cost of both multiple accounts and computers
makes it a choice only for the wealthy (or at least wealthier than I
am ;)  ) I'd probably try this if I had the resources. I'd then group
my druid, sk, cleric and toss in a new enchanter. The cleric and sk
are well on their way in terms of gear, both around level 37, but I'd
probably not even bother equipping the enchanter. Its only real
purpose would be mana battery duties, it would have instant get ghetto
junk like the oracle robe and such.



I think the reason why this has happened in EQ is that the
downtime/patience = difficulty design of this game have contributed
to making it exactly the opposite of what it is supposed to be; it is
supposed to be a multiplayer interaction game, as you state, but it
doesn't work out because only some classes carry the full deck. Other
classes are always going to be dependant upon other players yet not be
very desired for what they can contribute. 

The amount of time to accomplish anything also means you are never
taking a "break" from the action in town. Due to this, interaction is
nerfed from the get go. In restarting Anarchy Online I've seen the
exact opposite, people hanging around in town and at discos screwing
around since the XP getting part of the game is so non stop that you
get drained and need a break. They even added tradeskills and made
them the same way as everything else; you get points by leveling and
slap them on stuff for tradeskills. There is no endless repetition of
using a skill over and over to build it, you just build it. Even non
combat activities offer good experience rewards, I was getting one
third of the xp I got from a kill in my last mission just from picking
the locks on doors.. as a DOCTOR character!

EQ made too many "assumption" mistakes with its design. When you say,
"But players will group with that guy... making the game okay and fun
for him!", its an assumption mistake. You are trying to predict what
players will do, this does not work. A designer of an mmorpg should
never make any assumption like that. They should never assume that
other players are going to take up the slack, "we need huge downtime
because everyone is going to have an enchanter and a bard." This does
not work except for the few people with an enchanter and a bard.
