Um, no you haven't.  (But ditto on the "maybe they changed it since you
tried it".  Or after I tried it, I guess.)

I did some tests a few months ago, and after an initial Revive, an exp-rez
wouldn't give back any exp.

It sure would be nice if it did, though.  I can see why they
wouldn't want multiple exp-rezzes to pick up the "residual", but
I don't understand why they don't want to allow an exp-rez after
a simple Revive.
