We weren't talking about druids, we were talking about shamans.
Apparently you think the ability to quad kite othmir and then sit on
your butt for several minutes is superior than the ability to root dot
anything up to and including summoning mobs with only minor dents in
your health and then canni/torporing back to near full health and mana
in much less time than through regular medding.

Duoing with a shaman rocks.
