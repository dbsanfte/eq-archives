Definitely, I remember when I saw my first Mammoth, my Jaw dropped, I was
completely stunned, it was huge!  I still to this day get tingly when I go
back to Everfrost.  Such great memories there.  Every once and a while I
will still head out into the tundra and poke around, seeing things,
reliving memorie.

hehe yeah, well back then almost every barbarian was a shaman, warriors
were the rarity.

Aye, IMHO that is one of the best zones in the game, you can pretty much
stay there until 25-26.  The cash is pretty good too, especially when you
factor in some of the lower level quests (polar bear pelts specifically),
and tusks are great.

BY>
Aye, but I could not find it anywhere, its possible I may have thought I
bought it but did not, I never used root (obviously).  i perfer to snare,
like it when they try to "run" but get nowhere heh.
