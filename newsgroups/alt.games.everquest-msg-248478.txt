I just did this in the ocean in Plane of Tranquility.  Worked great - just
be careful you don't aim your head up because I wound up climbing up the
zone border somehow and wasn't earning swimming points for a while until I
came back and discovered it.  There's nothing in PoT that will attack you if
you don't attack it first.  And I didn't see anything at all in the water
while I was doing laps around the island either.
