If she's only trying to level tailoring, don't even worry about HQ bear
pelts.  Get a bunch of silks and make cured silk till it trivials at 72 or
somewhere around there.  Then farm/buy HQ cat pelts and make quivers till
they trivial at 110.  They're much more common and cheaper.  The HQ
rockhopper hides may be another route.  I'm not sure how the drop rate on
them compares to the HQ cats, but I don't think any HQ bear items trivial
over 110 anyway, and they're way to rare and expensive to use to level with.
