 Funny, the newbie areas are usually the only place I'd need them anyway
when trying to find a certain vendor. Other than that I hae them in my
head or printed out already so probably wouldn't use the ingame ones.

 That was one of their selling points for the Legends server. Like
waiting a month for it to arrive on Live servers is going to kill
anyone. If it bothers you that much perhaps you could move to Legends.
The don't say it will be a Stormhammer only zone. It's just starting out
there first. Like revamped ST and Hate.

 The benefits far outweigh the few instances where it would save me.
I've zoned and lost my buffs a lot more than I've zoned to remove a DoT.
Probably only twice that I can remember I've done that. You sort of
alluded to that with the following part that I snipped.
