love the new meds. my room mates will live another day.

anyways, i wonder how this is gonna impact KEI machines in PoK.

I noticed Hate had the 5min lockout too..certainly KEI would still be
useful there. but for the 30 second content? also, i spend a lot of
time soloing. I may skip on the KEI for that.

i'm also liking vow of valor. or, as they are calling it on the cleric
boards wow of valor. 71 cleric spell, reduces healing ability, but
gives a 800hp proc that goes off quite often...it also proc's a HoT. If
im soloing, that's all i'll ever need.
