Sounds like a *young* group, that is, a group that is still learning some of
the basics of good grouping.  Two important things:

/assist

Learn it.  Use it.  Set a macro.  The designated puller - let's call him
A_Puller00 - grabs a mob.  If more than one mob is pulled, A_Puller00
targets the toughest mob and /gsay's  "Incoming A_Tough_Mob".  Everyone then
starts pounding on that mob by targeting A_Puller00 and typing /assist.
Some people have a macro that targets the puller, /assist, /gsay "Assisting
A_Puller00".  I prefer silent assists myself; I just target the mob and
start nuking/pounding/whatever.  The important thing is that everyone starts
doing this, to kill A_Tough_Mob quickly.  Then A_Puller00 targets
A_Slightly_Less_Tough_Mob and again everyone does a /assist.  This tactic is
*crucial* to learn.

Now, I'm a cleric, and I often find myself getting pounded on after casting
a few heals.  I have a hotkey set up that will /gsay "I am under attack.
Please taunt this mob off me."  That lets the tanks know that I'm getting
wasted.  Since they depend on me for heals, this usually gets their
attention very quickly.  ^_^  In a good group, they'll taunt the mob back
onto themselves, then go back to pounding their first target.

Having those two things might have helped you tremendously in that group.
Just try to spread the word about good group tactics, and everything will
come together in time.
