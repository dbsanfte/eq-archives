Where the fuck did you learn math, and fire the teacher responsible.

Forget math. Just *think* for a second. Do you *think* the amount of
damage percentagewise is going to be different than the amount of
haste?

*sigh*

Figure 5.5 average damage (1-10), 100 swings, 50% hit. You do 275
damage.

Add 20% haste. Measure by number of attacks. You are now swinging 120
tiimes. You hit 60 times. Your damage is 330. Holy shit! A 20%
increase in damage! How did that happen!

How about 50% haste? 150 attacks, 75 hits. 412.5 damage. Percentage
increased damage? 50%.

Here was your mistake.1-12 is not the same as 120% of 1-10. The damage
he is measuring is TOTAL, not per hit, which only makes sense because
haste does not increase your maximum damage per hit.

There are no additional variables. The total damage is the same
percentage as the haste, it just has some random spread to it.
