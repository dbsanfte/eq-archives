I'm a monk trying to keep my H2H, 1HB and 2HB skills maxed.
1) Does dual-attack increase the chance of raising a skill?

2) Does the weapon in the second hand also increase skill?  That is, if I
have a 1HB in the second hand, will H2H and 1HB have a chance of raising, or
only H2H

3) Is the attack rating of the primary 'hand' the same as the second hand?
I have max H2H but low 1HB.  If I put a 1HB in the first hand, will punch
well or badly with the second hand?

4) How is the attack speed in the primary hand related to the second hand?
For instance, if I have bronze knuckles in the primary hand (delay 22) and a
1HB staff in the second hand, will the staff attack more frequently then if
I have bare primary hand (delay about 35).

Thanks for the help.
