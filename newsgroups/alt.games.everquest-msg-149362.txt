You're sounding a bit like the mages now Lance - They are complaining
that if the new pets are more powerful in one way or another than 
the epic, then it's useless (since post epic primary hand items exist
for mages).  I disagree with them (none of the new pets will combine
the huge HP (4.3k) massive innate DS (50) high melee DPS and huge 
proc damage + damage mitigation due to stuns all in one package.)  I
see a small parallel here - you may get a higher xp rez (say 98 or
99 percent) but, in a raid wipe situation are you going to use it, and
accept the huge downtime necessary to rez the raid?  Or just blow off
2% of the lost xp and get the raid rezzed in a few minutes?
