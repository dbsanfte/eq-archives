Yes. Norway.
I could understand it if they had a list of countries like Rwanda and
South Africa with high percentages of AIDS and other blood diseases
being banned and maybe do more meticulous screening of people from
other countries with lower disease risks, but instead they're taking
the easy way out and just banning everyone who wasn't born in this
area of parents born in this area. I am more at risk of carrying
something funky from the fact that I have had blood transfusions than
from the fact that I was born in Australia, but it doesn't make any
difference here.
