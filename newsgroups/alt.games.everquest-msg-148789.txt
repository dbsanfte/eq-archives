Hrm, not much I guess. Wizards and druids do make a lot of money
though. Anyone telling you it's not alot of money are the ones who are
in guilds with like 500k in the bank that they have access to. If you
hang out around bazaar or in very high populated exp areas you'll get
pleanty of business. I know that doesn't answer your question but
everyone should have a wizard or a druid at least for porting purposes
and maybe a little extra money to boot.
