Since mobs invariably prefer players to pets, and since neither the epic
pet nor the mage himself can root, getting that damage sponge working isn't
always easy. Pets are simply too fickle and shittily pathed to have a
notable affect on the damage absorb rating.

Epic pet = nothing if the mage himself has died from AE. The epic pet has a
lot of hp.

Some mages DO have the issue, and mages must return to towns to get their
supplies. Of course necros are not in the malachite market...but that's
good for them, because nobody but mages carries around stacks of malachite.
People carry bone chips...either deliberately, or just because they ended
up with some.

I would dearly like to be in one of your camps. 1k each time? Damn. Just
today I was in the chef room in Seb for 3 hours, and the split came to 173
platinum. Not even enough for a coffin.

Just poor luck I suppose. The only time I win /randoms are when I am
soloing. And coin/gem loot split between 6 people is laughable. It never
fails to amuse me to have the whole group go "ooh, ahh!" after camping a
spot for 5 hours and getting a 250 platinum split. In that same 5 hours, I
could go to everfrost or the rathe mountains and make 2k giant bashing.

To counter myself, the reason my shaman is relatively broke is because I
have a very expensive twink habit for my rogue, plus I am constantly having
to buy droppable items for myself (sarnak battle shield is the most
recent), since when I am in groups, the items either never drop, or are not
won by me.

It just isn't needed when I'm around, and people know this. Enchanters
don't die on my watch unless everyone does, and then a symbol will not have
helped :)

If there was any danger of that, they wouldn't be bored :)

Heals, hp/ac buffs, and stunning gaters mostly...

An enchanter can fill in for a shaman in a pinch...although they generally
hate it :)

Held the second floor ramp campsite in Velks the other day with just my
shaman, a ranger, and a (non-epic) mage. Easily. People underestimate
rangers, in the same way that it took forever for rogues to get out from
under their "rogues suck" label. I've had many groups where a ranger was
the only melee, and it has never been a problem. Raids are different, but
my ratings are not really aimed at raids.

I'm talking about the "when it works" part...the reduction when it happens
is 50%, but it doesn't happen all that often. People have done extensive
logging with ShowEQ, and the reduction in mana cost from being fully
specced in ....whatever...is 5-7%.

Well, we are talking about a time when Fear and Hate were the only high end
game in existance...so yes :) But it also worked on some other higher-end
animal creatures.

The druid pet loses in melee to emperor crush...not exactly the cat's ass
(to steal a line from dennis) at level 55+.

No, there isn't, which is why none of them received a 0 rating. Some really
suck at it tho.

Shamans do excellent crowd control, but it takes skill which many
twinkie/PLd shamans don't have.

I will have to stand corrected here on the usefulness of the free group
heal. On a shaman, it is like having clarity V cast on them...mana becomes
a non-issue. That helps the whole group. Oh, and this group had a ranger as
main assist :)

The whole idea is to avoid the need for that heal, which bards can do.

>regen rate enough that pathetic is more than adequate.  

Being that this is a L60 rating, I have to ask: Have you ever grouped with
a shaman who has torpor? Completely eliminates the need for a cleric in the
group.
