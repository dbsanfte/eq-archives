Altho I haven't picked it up, I have looked it over well. It IS
EQ on pen and paper. All simularities to D&D are on the
surface only, but all simularities to d20 are true. From what
I have read of the d20 OGL it isn't a true d20 product, since
it breaks some of the rules in character generation and mech-
anics, but the spirit of d20 is alive and well in EQ RPG. It seems
like they have kept the core mechanics of EQ in the RPG, but
at least in the pen and paper version, quests might actually
MEAN something besides the only way to get nodrop gear!
I was going to pick it up to steal what I could for my D&D
campaign, but most of the material wouldn't translate well
into 3e D&D. The levels are all off for the feats/skills. The
spells are all off for their D&D level. Tho it seems like a great
system, it won't translate well into D&D. Since I don't want
to restart my whole campaign setting, I probably won't try
to hybrid the 2 systems. I may buy the books for reading
and to "be verants little grognard" but doubtful that I will
play it unless I can find a DM that wants to run it. Then,
Beholm Drolendar, Enchanter (lvl 31) might try to relive
his career! (of course, he is already over the top level in
pen and paper, but oh well!
