Whatever buffs you do get... one thing id HIGHLY recommend..

Don't /tell <buff class> to buff you for donations..  even asking is bad.

Go to the nexus, wait for an ooc of "casting xxx for donations".. or ask in
ooc if anybody is casting your buff for donations..

Don't pester people, even if you do have the money to offer... because
chances are 100 other people have already asked, a lot of people will buff
for their own reasons, NOT because you are offering a few pp..  and because
its so damn easy to get buffs from somebody who is whoring themself.. you
shouldn't need to pester somebody.
