First, as others have said, Sony doesn't support camping in most 
instances.

Second, it sucks, but if you leave your camp even momentarily and someone 
else shows up in the meantime, how are they supposed to know that you 
have any kind of legitimate claim to the area? For all they know, you 
*were* camping it but left to go sell for a lengthy period. They can't be 
expected to just take your word. There are too many idjuts out there who 
would take complete advantage of that. If you leave your camp, it's 
unfortunately up for grabs. If someone wants buffs, call them to you.

Third, please see my post elsewhere in the thread on my views on camping 
int the first place.

May your EQ experiences be as bereft of d00d experiences as karmically 
possible.
