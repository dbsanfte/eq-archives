Sure,you are are right...versus live mobs,I see hits for 100
frequently versus Undead;Hammer has bane damage vs. undead +12,
making it a 18del/26dam weapon,even with our non existing damage
bonus,capped 1hblunt skill and no double attacks its not too shabby.

Note thats all just for fun,have nothing better to upgrade or my money
to spend on,I have FT items rotting in bank and all the Foci I need.
I am not a big fan of the higher hp/mana game,as you could see in my
posting some weeks ago about Cleric 66+ spells,not that I ever wiped
with less than 50% mana. =)
I melee nearly everywhere,even in the highest level zones I frequently
visit(MPG) or on raids.
Item of my dreams wouldnt be the epic 2.0,I would be most happy if
I could get the not no rent version of our hammer from VZ or Saryn.
