I'm unconvinced. The rules of many games are designed to emulate whats 
possible in the real world, not whats legal. Its perfectly possible in 
the real world to beat someone to death with a club and steal their 
cash... thus its possible to do so in some video games too... perhaps 
just as in the real world it isn't legal in the virtual either.

If we establish that the game cash has real monetary value, ie... I can 
consider my pp holdings as an asset, becuase I can exchange it for US 
dollars more or less at will... then it IS an asset.

If its stolen from me then its theft, if its swindled from me then its 
fraud... and if I neglect to declare it as income than I am liable for 
failing to pay taxes on undeclared assets...

MJ has been pushing the concept of Norrath as an island economy... well 
if his model is adopted then the hosting nation will have jurisdiction 
on that island... and your conduct, your assets, and your earnings must 
all be subject to those laws .... Its a ridiculous notion I think, but 
its a required one if you are going to argue that we should recognize 
fraud when I swindle you in the game.

According to a number of the people here you should be able to do 
exactly that, especially if he 'cheated' in some way.
