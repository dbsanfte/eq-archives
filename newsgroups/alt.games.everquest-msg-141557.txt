Yeah, but if you have to kill 20 mobs like that, mana can become an
issue.

I'm not saying that the druid pet is the most useful thing in the
game.  Hell, it falls pretty far down on the useful spectrum.  It DOES

And, push comes to shove, I just want the spell.  Just like I want
Wake of Karana.  Just for novelty value if nothing else.
