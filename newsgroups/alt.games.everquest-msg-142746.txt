You know, I sorta somewhat remember that.  Vaguely.  In the middle of
heated guild-speak and battle-spam, however, I missed it.  Sorry about
that, I do try not to ignore tells.  I even answer the the "Can you come
PL me dude?" one with a curt "No", at the very least.  
   Ok, I admit.  I've never joined a serverwide chat.  Perhaps I'll give
that one a go.  But how do I make a chat channel auto-join?  Just
curious.

Annie <--- Also misses the vast majority of posts to age, so Mr. Monk
got lucky this time.
