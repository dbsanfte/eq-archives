Well, it looks to me as if it boils down to a difference of opinion
as to what constitutes "customer service".  And personally, I would
rather they "serve" me as they have, with the steady stream of bug
fixes (CS by any reasonable definition) and content additions (I can
see an argument against new content that must be purchased, but game
enhancements like the newbie armor quests are definitely CS to my
mind), than spend their effort holding hands and wiping noses while
letting the game itself languish.  And it would appear that I am not
alone in that judgement.  EQ, CS warts and all, sure looks to be a
lot stronger than its competitors.

Caveat:  If the CS deficiencies you see in EQ are a big deal to you,
feel free to keep complaining and to agitate others to add there
voices to yours.  SOE most definitely seems to be engaging in the
squeaky-wheel theory of management for EQ, the changes I dislike all
seem to have grown out of the extended and voiciferous bitching of
other players.  At the same time, I'll feel free to argue with you
when I disagree with your opinions.  After all, from my POV, my
opinions and preferences are clearly superior to yours, lol.  :-p
