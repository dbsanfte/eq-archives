Faction really took on a new meaning in velious, with the 3 rivalling
factions required to raid, and quest armour.
This didnt carry on in subsequent expansions, you can raid without needing a
specific faction, and you can obtain your spoils without faction linked
quests

Guilds who deem faction as no longer important are simply in a post-velious
era of raiding
