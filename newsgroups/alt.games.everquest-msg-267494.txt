Odds of your obscure food allergy reaction estimated at one in 600 
million (based on her finding zero cases in the US population)

Odds of food poisoning death estimated at one in ten (based on her 
finding a 10% death rate in reported cases... admittedly, reported cases 
is probably the tip of the iceberg, most food poisoning never gets 
reported at all. Shall we say, like an iceberg, that only 10% do?  That 
means one in 100.  1% vs .000016%?

The existence of a risk is insufficient information to base a decision 
on, unless you are James "never Tell me the odds" Kirk
