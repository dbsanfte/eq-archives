Correct.  However, they could be a little better on the messages, so people
at least know it is a patch in progress and not something just temporarily
wrong.

It's interesting that the Mac version of Everquest seems to patch a lot
faster.  Someone said that it was becuase there were fewer users, but I
don't see how number of users would affect the time to patch (unless the
patch involves a change to the contents or meaning of the player database,
and so some sort of conversion or at least consistency check has to be run).
