Not in my experience.  I've kept stuff taunted on my ranger through an 
entire fight using things like snare and, well, taunt and other such non-
damaging methods and have never had it steal xp.  Was I at the top of the 
hate list?  You bet.

I'm pretty sure xp is still based on damage.  Otherwise it would be trivial 
for someone to come in, chain stun something to grab aggro right as it dies 
and steal the xp for it.
