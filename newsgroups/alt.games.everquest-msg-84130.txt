Everyone I know who "left" EQ to play DAOC is now back in my guild in
EQ pushing for raids and such just like they always used to do.

Its too easy to get max level in DAOC and at that point all there is
for you to do in DAOC it seems is pvp yet there is not much incentive
in place to pvp. I never played DAOC because I was waiting to see how
other's described it once the honeymoon was over. The honeymoon is now
over and most are getting an annulment. Oops by saying "most" I am no
guilty of generalizing with no facts in addition to the original
poster!
