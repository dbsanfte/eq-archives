It seemed to work for me in Tim Deep.....the setup. At the ogre camp. I
decide to rescue someone training a raider and a watchman before realising
that I have bitten of more than my wounded self can chew. I root the two
of them. Leggit from camp to where the raft comes in...sit and med like
crazyt bang off a few heals and some bandages.....one root fails and in
comes the green raider.....chop him and bash out Camo. About a minute
later the second root fails.....Watchman merrily wanders back to his spawn
spot and doesnt come back to me.....I break camo and wait once medding has
done its stuff.....no return of watchman, still on track. Other guy
reports same as he had done Hide and snuck away. Evenutally get tired of
waiting go to spawn spot and beat on Watchman.

I dont know if this goes back to the Hell with it range that was suggested
(the mob was always in sight), or if the Camo did something and if myself
and someone else approached the mob at its spawn it would have gone for me
due to elevated Hate but it was definitely doing something.....even if of
limited use....and Tim Deep aint somewhere where you or anyone else is
zoning sharpish.
