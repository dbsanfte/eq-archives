Grouping takes an effort above and beyond that of simply killing the 
mobs. Sometimes I feel like dealing with people, sometimes I don't. When 
I solo, efficiency is of no concern whatsoever; most of the time I root-
rot on one screen while I post on this NG on another one, not worried if 
a DoT wears off while I'm not watching, for example.

If I were grouped, I would have an obligation to be on the ball and to 
be as efficient a player as I possibly could; as I said, some days 
that's what I'm looking for, but not necessarily all the time, so the 
situation Ken is describing would have suited me fine at the time.
