Not to be found an ass or "hax0r", but I would really like to know how you
get back to the game after alt-tabbing out. For some reason my win2k pc
sometimes does a random focus shift. this causes EQ to be minimized. I can
still hear sounds, but the second I try to get back via Taskmanager>Switch
To... or clicking the icon on the taskbar, nothing happens, the computer
restarts or in rare cases I get back but half of the keyboard and the mouse
don't function anymore plus the interface is screwed up.

I've tried just about everything to fix this, including several re-installs,
messing with more settings then I knew existed and slowly installing all
programs which run on the background.
The only thing I can think of is that it happened just after the latest
patch, but on that day I also installed about 3 new programs, none of which
I could determine as the problem.

A simple way to switch back would make my life and that of any group I'm in
a lot easier.
