Some more information on /assist would be appreciated for this
relative newbie.  I was grouped with a late teens gnome enchanter a
while back (my druid was mid teens at the time) and he kept on telling
everyone assist because he was mezzing.  My role was mainly as a
buffer/healer, so I don't think I was one of the ones that pissed him
off.  One guy even left the group because he thought he'd caused a
couple of deaths by attacking the wrong mob, which the gnome admitted
wasn't actually the case.  When I had to melee a couple of times I
tried /assist, but I wasn't comfortable with it because I didn't know
how it's supposed to work.  Since then the opportunity hasn't arisen.
