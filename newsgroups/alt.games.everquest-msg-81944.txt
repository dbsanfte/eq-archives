Im not sure heh.. it was just bizare having so many bards there.  One had ae
mana song though,  which made some others feel useless... ah well it was a
quick fight, and they can at least do 500 melee dmg :)

Ok lemme re-phrase heh.. do they get a worthwhile ae mez?

We do pull them back to the Reet room.. typically it's a race to get Trak
though, so once you have a CoH setup, you move in with as few people as
happen to be there already.. by the time the protector jugg is dead, we can
still be cohing people in, so anybody who wasnt buffed in the reet room will
get it just before the bridge.

Traks a crappy fight though.. takes all that time to kill through to him,
and he drops in 30 seconds

Bards are the one class I still know nada about... I thought after like
level 30, your big songs (ala mez) used mana?

Excluding my guild, I can only name umm.. 2 60 bards, and a 59 bard on my
server :)
