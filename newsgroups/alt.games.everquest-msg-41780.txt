Find pages 26 L&R.  Buy the research book.  Keep the research book with you
at all times until you find a high level enchanter in the zone, then
politely ask them to combine the pages for you.  You will have ZERO trouble
getting someone to agree.

One of the sides of 26 is too damned rare, and AE mez is too damned
important to a 16 enchanter to do the research him/herself unless you have a
few copies of the pages laying around.

Hell, at level 54 any time I see either side of 26 available for sale I buy
them then give the spell to the next level 14-17 enchanter I see.

Changing the subject a little.... Personally, every level I put all my
practice points into Research up until level 48 or so because I didn't want
the hassle of keeping any pages but the ones I absolutely NEEDED.
