>>> But you can easily and very cheaply get cooking skill up to a point

spending an hour or two cooking Fish Rolls, which are actually a nice food
to have.<<<

This is INSANELY easy to do now. You can buy fish AND batwings from the same
building in the human Jaggedpine fort. There is not an oven, but you can buy
a spit from them as well.

Dark races can buy these from the Brell Gnoll vendors in the zone as well.

Get someone to make you a non-stick frying pan and after you hit 136. You
can use the pan, meat from griffons/griffons/anacondas, bread and cheese to
raise your skill as well. Bread and cheese are also sold by the above
mentioned vendors.
