Remember when Manaburn first came out, and everyone and their little brother
made an all-powerful-to-be wizard?  The vast majority of whom never made it
past 25?  (And, of course, Manaburn was nerfed and they all became bankers
and bazaar vendors).

That's what I see happening with the crowd that never learned how to play
without KEI.  A number of them will get bored with the classes before they
get very high, because play is trivial.  A few will get up to where KEI is
actually a good idea and find out that mana preservation is harder than it
looks, and quit to play an iksar monk or halfling druid.  ('em grins at the
minor dig)  And some will slowly learn the skills they should have picked up
in their 20s, gently coached by their guildies and friends, at a time when
recovering from a mistake means medding back up after ress - which,
honestly, is less painful than it would have been in the 20s when it meant a
long CR and buying a newe KEI.  /snicker  The trick is to teach them in XP
groups instead of on raids, where they can wipe you.
