I have a 75 raid geared cleric who can hold his own well in any older 
content and on a separate account some new characters I am leveling, the 
highest of which is a 70 monk. I'd like to raise money to fund tradeskills 
leveling as well as gear for my new characters. The cleric is a semi-retired 
main of many years and now I'd rather enjoy my new guys in the group game. 
But the cost of things in the bazaar is crazy so I need to get out there and 
farm for cash somehow.

I actually enjoy playing one character at a time a lot more than two and 
resort to boxing only when its helpful late nights or for rezzes, buffs, 
etc. Even my little guys, rather than PL them with the cleric I prefer to 
give them a nice long temp and send them on thier merry way. Wandering off 
topic here but I am raising a sk, necro and mage along with the monk and so 
far the monk is the new main of sorts but I've been thinking probably the 
necro should be as I need nobody else to go have some fun if friends are 
asleep and I am not.

Back to the matter at hand, what zones would be good for my cleric to farm 
would you guys think? He does runs through Veksar easily and the tribute 
items are nice but things there don't sell like they used to. A mage friend 
of mine used to like Cobalt Scar and Siren's Grotto I think but I forget 
why. I never did play much at all in Old Seb so that would probably be a lot 
of fun but its also probably perma-camped to this day by people farming the 
Kunark armors, etc. there.

I haven't checked and probably should but maybe just grinding some AA solo 
in Halls of Honor would be good and sell all the ores, etc. The thing is I 
am starting Smithing now so I'd hate to part with any of that until I reach 
my goals there.

Please don't mind me rambling on. I am famous for this. Any suggestions 
where either the monk or the cleric or perhaps both could farm/xp would be 
great. I'd love to spend some time at this so I can outfit my guys with nice 
things from the bazaar since I have no intentions of ever raiding again 
beyond perhaps epics in a family guild.

I should add that the cleric has almost 700 AA with defensives prior to SoF 
maxxed, a mix of anguish gear to TSS tier 4, epic 2, decent augs, etc. and 
is a very capable soloer now at least for old world stuff. So it might be 
fun to just have him do the farming on his own unless there's a place that I 
could combine good xp for the monk with this.
