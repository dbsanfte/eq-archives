The troll is an idiot - camp on the tracks, and eat the trains.

However, the guards on the wall in Misty are not newbie guards (those
are buffed to the point of making them a poor choice).  You should
learn to stop running for the guards all the time.  

When I was lower level, I hunted those masked rodents myself - the 
spear they always drop sells for just shy of 10pp.  That was good, steady,
income for me then.

Whining about guard killers is almost as stupid as whining about people
training zones.
