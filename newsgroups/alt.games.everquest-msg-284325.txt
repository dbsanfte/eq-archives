Ah, this might be another case of Progression server differences
having subtle side effects.  Being on a regular server, I had no
problem finding a Spell Haste focus, plus the cleric usually casts
Blessing of Faith (I don't know if that's available on Combine),
and they stack, giving me 25% spell haste.  But spell haste applies
only to spells with casting times of 3 sec or higher.

Next, Dooming Darkness takes 3 seconds, not 4.  So for me it comes
down to 2.25 secs, which is still slower than Terror but still
pretty quick.  Still, I'll play around with the Terror line a bit
to see how it feels in comparison, particularly for peeling off adds
after the bard's been mezzing/charming.

A good point.  I've occasionally wanted to do something to take an add
off the cleric or bard, but Darkness is the only really high aggro spell
in my regular lineup, and I don't like using it vs adds because (a) it
does take a while to cast, and that's time that I'm not piling up hate
vs the main target, and more important (b) it means the bard can't mez
the add.  Mostly we do okay with me just concentrating on my target and
letting the bard handle CC, but I wouldn't mind having more options, so
again, I'll try it out and see if I like it. :-)
