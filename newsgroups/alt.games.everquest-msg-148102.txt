I'm not sure about after level 30 but once you get up to like 45+
the leveling starts to get very very slow. Then if you're someone
like a wizard you start having to look very hard for good soloing
places because most groups will never actively look for a wizard
to join, and with soloing you get the problem of maybe it's a 
remote area that you'll have trouble getting a cleric to come to
if you die due to a hang up or network crash or whatever
causes you to go LD plus most soloing places that high are
very highly camped. And you might have the same problem with
a druid, people want clerics or shamans that come with slow and
other things. They'll take druids if it's a last resort but they
mainly want clerics in the group to ressurect if there's a bad pull or
something. And even if you're in a group the long hours of monotony
killing and killing and killing and killing and maybe once in a while
dying and losing about 10-20 minutes of exp then continuing on with
the killing. All the things involves with exping at high levels just
makes it a very pissy thing sometimes and probably why most people
quit for that reason. Heh maybe after I have the luxury of being able
to play any game with my new p4 2.4ghz computer I'll check out one
of the other MMORPGs and see if any of them have figured out how
to eliminate the horridly long hours of boring exp time...
