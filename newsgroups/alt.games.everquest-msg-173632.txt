I second that.  Especially if you have someone that has a key to 4 or 5.  
The one to 5 isn't that bad, but it can get dangerous to do repeatedly with 
a large group if invis keeps dropping.  The key to 6 is pretty easy to do 
if you know which mobs to kill to get the Enraged Relative to spawn.  One 
mob spawns the Enraged Relative every time, and others have a differing 
percentage chance of spawning it.  If you concentrate on the right mobs, 
you can gets keys pretty quickly here, some Velium loot and maybe a couple 
nice rings to boot.
