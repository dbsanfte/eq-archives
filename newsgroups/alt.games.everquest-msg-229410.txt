Is the hack that shows everything in the zone still working?

I've never tried it myself, but my experience was wizards that could track
better then rangers on PvP shards. I figured the low number of rangers was
two fold, weak character and enough people running the hack that tracking
was pointless.

Anyway, you will find that what people do on a PvP server as it evolves is
snipe. They get a low level character and buff them with see invis, SoW,
that kind of stuff, and then haunt the newbie areas. Just more easy targets
in the newbie areas.
