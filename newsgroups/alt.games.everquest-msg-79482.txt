You win - as we have a consent farther down the message, I don't

That's what I thought about. Glad I made a sensible suggestion :*)

Hey - you're unfair :p
That's metaphorically calling the guards - or would you think
they'd come running if I
/shouted Guards! Intruders assaulting the main gate!!!
? Probably not, huh?

Well - I do kill "their" guards - just I do it where a zone is near :)
But I only kill the freeport militia, that's the only guards that
are evil to everyone (not kos, mind you, just corrupt), besides
from the corrupt Queynos guards, maybe...
Oh - and the rangers in EC/WC ... what class where you playing again?`
*g, d, r*

Though I must admit it didn't take me as long, but
that was more because at 35 I was a _lot_ better
at mentally mapping areas than I was at level 1...
