The faction raising quest can be done at max kos, the green guy is non-agro.
You won't be able to buy the skins/salts in bulk though, no one really hunts
in Droga/Nurga unless they're doing faction, or possibly camping the Idol of
the Thorned or Shroud of Nature, and the last 2 will probably be contacted
by people in zone who want the faction items.

The Cords require near max ally.

Depends what slot you want the cords for as to whether it's viable or not.
IIRC they're shoulder/wrist/arm;  Shoulder - Strength of the Elements;
Wrists - Crystallized acid;  Arms - /shrug.
