Yeah, I don't think that would be much fun.   Which is probably why they
didn't do it there.

Thats what it seemed like to me. (1)

Even if you stayed naked with a starter rifle, level 1 takes about 15
minutes, and at level 2 you can afford any of the three variations of your
team's "Max" armor, which is a combination weapon / armor set that is _very_
strong combatwise, if somewhat limited in that you can't do hacking, medical
or repair while wearing it.  I never went the max route, since I didn't
enjoy that style of fighting.  Buying weapon certifications and armor
certifications separately, it'll take until about level 6 or 8 for you to
have any combination of skills that you want.  Which is still a very short
time in the game.

The levels don't start getting "long" until after 10 or 12.   Theres
character advancement in that you can go all the way to 20, but the only
real advantage you get out of the extra levels (the ones you won't catch up
right away) is flexibility.

A level 20 might have the ability to get any one of three vehichles when he
wants it, assault buggy, tank or interceptor flyer, but he can still only
drive one at a time.  Once he chooses X vehicle, his extra levels in the
other vehicles mean nothing.  And his personal weapon / armor levels, not a
whole lot more.   A level 3 who bought nothing other than X vehicle
certification is essentially equal to him.

Or, a level 20 might have every weapons ceritification, so they can order up
a weapon combo for any occasion, but it's not like he will have all those
options on him when he reaches the "newbie" in the field.  Limited inventory
space and the need to carry ammunition limits both of them to a practical
maximum of about two weapons, three if they're willing to go light enough on
ammo/medpacks that they risk running out.


(1) I should note at this point that I did not buy the expansion pack, so
the game might have changed some since I was last playing.

Hmm... actually, I now remember why I quit.   I guess it still might be
worth $10 to go back a month and see if they un-nerfed my play style.
Possible, since I think the change was more an unintended side effect of
another change.
