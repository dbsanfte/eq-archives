Anyone know if you can do the 8th Garadain Ring quest with indiff.
faction?

I'd like to do it with a character that is KOS.  I'm looking at 2
possibilities, and I think both will land me with indiff. faction:

1)  Have a Chanty charm him, then hand in the head of Chief Ry'Gorr.
Dunno if he can be charmed though.

or,

2)  Harmony him, initiate the trade window from as far back as I can,
have someone invis me, and then complete the trade.

Comments, suggestions?
