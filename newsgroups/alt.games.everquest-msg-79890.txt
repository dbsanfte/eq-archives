Didn't know this...how annoying. I was hoping I could practice defensive
skills tanking light blue mobs. Full blues tend to really hurt.

A Parry is using your own weapon to block the weapon of your enemy, thus
meaning no damage is taken. A Riposte is a sequence where you parry the
attack, thus putting the opponents blade out of action, and launch an
immediate counter-attack. In both cases the attack fails to injure you.
