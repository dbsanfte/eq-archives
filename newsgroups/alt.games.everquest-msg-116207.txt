Or stay and grow with your guild all the way up to 60.  CONTRIBUTE to your
guild so that when you hit 60 you'll be able to do everything a raid guild
can.  Those with no loyalty to anyone but themselves (certainly a valid
option...it IS, after all, a game) is only one option.

Considering that chances are your guild leader takes the guild seriously,
and considers members friends, although they'll publicly wish you the best
in your new uberguild, chances are pretty damned good that you've hurt them
personally.  Speaking for myself, I just call them lameasses (not publicly,
that wouldn't be good politics), but I've known guildleaders to get
downright depressed.  If you DO decide to dump the guild who has taught you
everything, so that you can go off exploring other options, don't try to
placate your ex-guild by offering to keep an alt in it...it's a slap in the
face.
