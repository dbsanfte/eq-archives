Yes. You will be able to turn off all of the new models for other
races and still play/see the vahshir model. To play the vahshir though
you need luclin enabled (you need to have it installed, purchased,
etc)

No, I think they said the vah shir are pretty neutral though I can't
remember where. There is no evil vah shir class to worship an evil
diety. I think that they said even the Shaman won't have a diety but
instead they are so close to nature they get their shamanistic magic
from the air more or less. I remember seeing verant say that but have
no idea where the heck it was now.
