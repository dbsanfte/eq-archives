One more thing on this Bob... I spend a lot of money on what all the people
posting here consider their bread and butter for the most part. So one thing
is for sure, when I say something most of the time, it's from hands on, in
depth, use of the product (Not because I have some web site that is paid to
advertise or because I am a developer, which many of these posts are). I get
into a lot of betas that most people don't. I see a lot of things that the
press doesn't see until some time later (which I never comment about until
it hits the street).

I have one goal in mind, honesty. In all things. As silly as that sounds.
You might paint that as some "only someone with money can think that way"
kind of perspective... I am not perfect, neither are game companies. When I
post, it's GENUINE. You might disagree, you might even hate me, but it's my
perspective. I don't hedge. I don't give in. If I am wrong, I admit it. I do
apologize to people when it's the right thing to do. I do not forever say I
am "never" wrong such as you seem to always do.

This thread is serious, unlike anything else I have ever posted. You can
play the crossposted card, and any other card you feel is required to "win"
some silly conflict. But please understand, in the near future, you will
look back on this and understand that a certain amount of people somewhere,
will have benefited from the advice above. And I hope, you and others
attacking me for simply trying to help, will sober up.
