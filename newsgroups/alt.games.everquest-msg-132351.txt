OK, so right before you level, it seems you get a lot of skill points all at
once.   EG, I usually get 3 or 4 more "You have become better at Sense
Heading..." messages right before a level.  Now, since I'm the master of
"Cool!  Another Level!  I am GOD!" and getting myself killed & deleveled, I
have a quick question:

Does losing a level take away that bump in skill points or do I keep them?

I've never kept track close enough to tell.  I just hit/lost/regained level
21 - looking at sense heading, it looks like I kept the bump (from 105 to
108) before I first hit 21.  As I was fighting blues to get 21 again, I
noticed sense heading made it up to 110.

Just curious...
