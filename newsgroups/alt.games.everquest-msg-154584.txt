The fun part is that hes not even very creative at trying to ruin your 
rep. Appearantly noone can find the posts you alledgedly made, so guess 
theyre made up. And if i were to make up some posts to ruin someones 
rep, they would be a lot worse than these.

I give him a 0.2 on the troll/stalker scale.
