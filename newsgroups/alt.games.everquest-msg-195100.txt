I'm sure there are new players, as I have been playing since beginning of
commercial release and have recently been surprised at having to explain
tactics, etc (when I am on alts, of course).  As for EQ being superior, I
too have tried every big name MMORPG along the way and have been greatly
disappointed everytime, coming back to EQ...I had high hopes for shadowbane,
but what's the point when even when learning the game, others can take all
your stuff.  I don't mind PvP, heck was even looking forward to it for a
change, but something is wrong with a system where even a low level loses
almost all property to looters when they die...shrug...just another
bookshelf decoration and cancelled account...and back to EQ...I do have
REALLY high hopes for EQ II....
