I have a level 29 enchanter at the giant fort in Frontier Mountains right
now. I was wondering what spells I should have memed to be of the most help
to my group. I was told that the giants could not me mezzed or stunned but
could be charmed. A player left my group because I was the worst enchanter
he had ever seen. I did not mez a giant that was on him and he said I should
have. I told him they resisted mez and he says "Have you never heard of
tashani". Help
