Yes indeed. Want your cleric epic? Can't manage to get Ragefire with
your guild? Well, my friend, your worries are over. Thanks to the
brilliant (gag... vomit) genius of some clerics on Xev, you TOO can have
your click stick! And in RECORD time!

(This may take a while to type, as I'll likely have to stop and throw up
several times getting it out. Good lord, this is on my own server and
I'm totally sick over it.)

Take a look at this thread on Graffes.

http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=19860.topic

The long and the short of it is... apparently you can get four or five
clerics to all bring a raid force to Skyfire. Then start petitioning and
arguing until you get some GMs there. Then, (and this is the key to the
strategy) absolutely REFUSE to come to any sort of arrangement that you
all agree on, and refuse to accept any sort of forced /random by the GM.

Result? You'd think that the GM would just /kill rage to punish you for
not getting along, right? Or force a /random and warn/ban anybody who
didn't hold up to the result. Right?

Bzzzzzzzt! Wrong! No, the intrepid GMs decide to spawn Ragefire five
times in a row so that all the clerics can get their clicksticks. I've
been holding out hope that this was still all some sort of sick joke,
but on the server boards, members of the guilds involved have confirmed
it and said "why" it was done, etc.

A new day dawns on Norrath.

Vendor_01 tells you, 'Hello, Healsdabooboos. Have you seen the Click
Stick I just got in?'

probably more productive."
