1.  Lots of ultra-rare loot that looks cool on your character (this is the
most important factor!)

2.  A tough death penalty.  This builds a sense of "danger" (ie "how am I
going to get my corpse back??")

3.  Different complementary character classes.  MMRPG's where everyone
becomes a tank-mage stink.

4.  Cooperative gameplay.  Competitive or solo gameplay in MMRPG's nearly
always stinks.

5.  Tough MOB's that take huge groups of (coordinated) people to kill.  This
makes guilds important.

6.  No "mission terminals".  Games with Mission Terminals all stink.

7.  Lots of interesting NPC's.

8.  Complex Quests.  Cool reward of ultra-rare loot on quest completion.

9.  Huge game world.  Nobody wants to play a game that has 3 zones.

10.  Good dispersion of crowds.  There is nothing worse than a zone with 350
people in it (ie the EQ "kiss your frame rate goodbye" Bazaar)

11.  Game mechanics that encourage "ad hoc" grouping.  I shouldn't need to
join a guild to have fun.
