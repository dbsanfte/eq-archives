    The funny part is the specific event that triggered his officers to
abandon ship. They killed the AoW, and monk pants dropped. There were no
monk mains there that needed the pants, and under their system you couldn't
bid on gear for twinks (they had been burned once by someone spending DKPs
on every droppable item they got, then EBay'ing them). So the guildleader
looted the pants and "destroyed" them, since they'd be a rot. He even
celebrated this in the news section of the guild website, a "we're so uber
we destroyed these" sort of thing.

    Then, according to rumour, a monk twink, tagged with this guild but whom
nobody could place to a main, appeared with... AoW pants.
