It's nice where it works.  In Grieg's End, in Grieg's room, the top 1/3rd 
of the screen was totally messed up.  It was getting multiple images 
there.  I have not seen that anywhere else yet.  In SKyshrine, near 
Yelinak's chamber, the sun was shining through a wall depending on how 
far from the wall I was.  Targetting sometimes works, sometimes doesn't 
now.  My mouse clicks stopped working entirely in Grieg's End until I 
camped to desktop and came back in.  Those are the things I have noticed 
so far.
