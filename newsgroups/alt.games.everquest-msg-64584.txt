I got patch downloaded after 12 hours.  On a fast Dsl connection it took
about 35 minutes to update . logged on... Crashed.. Had to do a hard
boot...crashed a few more times...turned ALL the character models off..they
are Ghey..except for the Iksar.  The way plane clipping works seems to kinda
suck...  it's choppy.  Some people are experiencing mouse problems..like the
right button not working correctly.  I finally got boot graphics for ancient
wyvern hide boots for my monk. They look nice.  Sounds are different in game
now like running and coin transfer.
I'm running an athlon 1.33 gigahertz, 384 megs of ram, Nvidia GForce 2 64
meg video card, soundblaster 512 card.  If you have less than that with the
models on I feel sorry for you...  It's gonna suck.. I'm running eq in
640X480 mode.   light option off and everything toned down.  Ok..that's the
scoop.  Had to log off cause they are taking the servers down at 1 am
pacific for a 20 min patch.
