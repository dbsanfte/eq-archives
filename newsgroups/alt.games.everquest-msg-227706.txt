Stick another 512 MB of RAM in that bad boy, and scrap the video card 
for a 128 Mb model, and you'll be kicking. In fact, it will be almost 
exactly what I built for playing Star Wars Galaxies, and EQ runs like 
warm butter on it. I can keep the clipping plane out near max and dance 
my way through the bazaar at peak playing times.
