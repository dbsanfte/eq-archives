This has raised it's head in another forum, and I want a sanity check to
make sure I've not:
1. Totally lost my mind
2. Never understood melee equipment and strats
or
3. Missed out on more recent changes in the game that changed things
massively

The scenario:

Person creates a new warrior twink and has some cash to blow on him.
(Not unlimited, but enough for fairly good gear.)  This warrior is at
around level 24/25 and still no where near the AC soft cap. Person
decides to blow a good chunk of their cash getting a Fungi for the chest
slot. (AC 21, but has the 15 HP/tick regen.)

My understanding, since way back in the day, was that AC was God for
warriors. Damage mitigation is > All.  Assuming you are spending most of
your time in groups with a healer available (which this twink in
question confirmed was the case) and not soloing, wouldn't a nice 50 AC
or more BP be a better investment for the BP slot than a fungi?
Personally, unless you are trying to solo primarly, and looking to
reduce downtime, I see the Fungi for a warrior being more of a novelty
item, or very specific situational tool. Much like a manastone for a
caster. (As I found out recently. They are not nearly all they are
cracked up to be anymore.)

I won't even go into the specific reasons I thought this, but would
rather leave it to you to confirm, deny, and/or back up as you see fit.

So, with the above conditions, what say you? Fungi or, for example,
Fierce Heraldic or something else akin to that?
