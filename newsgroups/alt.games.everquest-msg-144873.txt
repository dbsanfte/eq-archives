WHOAH this kicks much butt.. I assumed simply more "particles", as in
spell rain effects or whatver.. but its actually 3D spell THINGS.

Love the big shield 3d thing and wolfs head. Its a good thing they put
in a clip plane for it though because this would lag you to crud. I'll
always have this off, as will anyone concerned with frame rate, but
its still cool. It basically is what spells seem to look like in EQ2.
