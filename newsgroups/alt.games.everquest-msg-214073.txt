not that i want to be a sour pete, but i actually started a FV char with my
ol' lady this past weekend, and we stumbled across some NVA in freeport

they seemed like fun, until the "/shout NVA is now recruiting role players!
we are a nice bunch of people" or something to that effect

it kind of shot my mood; role play guilds don't shout that they're role play
guilds while in a role play game.....

-- EVERYONE LOOK AT HOW SUBTLE I AM! // i am so much better at humility than
you --

oh well

on the other hand, there was an ikky necro there with a z heart . .. that's
pretty cool, didn't expect that =)
