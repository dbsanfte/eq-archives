Long time ago, I think on the C64

I remember it only vaguely, I think it was a graphic adventure sort of 
thing, where you woke up in Chiba city, face down in a plate of 
spaghetti with your memory gone, and had to wander around, working up 
your computer, cybergear, skillsofts and software, hacking into 
mainframes and so on, trying to solve the mystery of your own existance. 
  Eventually you got to the point where you could actually log into a 
kind of cyberspace, so the game became something completely different, 
sort of a tron environment, and in there you had to defeat an AI, 
something like that.

It wasn't a huge game, a few hours worth of play... and as I said, it 
had a DEVO soundtrack, written exclusively for the game I think; you did 
end up hearing some repetition, but there was a lot of sound material 
and the game wasn't all -that- long, so it wasn't too annoying.
