complete bullshit.

I could point out most of his gear/level.. but I'll just focus on one...   a
55 warrior with an FT V ring? ahahahaha do me a favour

currently working on his epic?  but umm.. if those are really his weapons,
he already has a LOT better then his epics...

Tell you what...  I'll make a character up in Magelo too.. twink it out with
ntov/AoW/Tormax/Tunare/Creator loot.. and I'll do a straight trade for your
warrior ok?
