No, the cleric's obligation is to heal. Rezzes are usually a courtesy.
( One other condition I failed to list where I would consider a rez a
requirement is where the death(s) were the fault of the cleric. )

If the tank doesn't want to have his ass landed in a situation where
he may need a rez, he sure as hell better taunt. 'cause if it's
obvious the tank isn't taunting, in a cleric's shoes I'd switch to a
very different spell: Gate.
