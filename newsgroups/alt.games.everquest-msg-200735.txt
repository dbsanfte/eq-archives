I don't know that asking other people is really going to help you much. You seem
to have pretty much decided that you're not happy with things as they are, but
you don't seem open to the idea of switching guilds, creating alts, or changing
servers. Not much choice other than that but to quit, is there? My secret? I
play to have fun and relax. I don't play to get to a particular level, or obtain
particular equipment, or get through a particular plane. I don't find that game
any less fun than it was when I started years ago (I won't say less stimulating,
since I no longer feel stark terror at the sight of an orc centurion, but you
get the idea). If 3/4 of my friends quit, I'd keep playing. They got me into the
game, it's true, but I don't play for or because of them. I usually don't even
play with them these days.

Really, I think it's all about personal preference. There have been other games
in the past that I've felt I was done with, and I stopped playing them. If I
felt like they still had something for me, but I needed to do something
different to access it, then it would be a judgement call: is it worth it or
not? Honestly (and this is not a flame, so please don't take it as one) I think
you may need to loosen up your criteria in EQ somewhat. Granted, it may not be
an ideal option to create an alt if only one class is your "best fit," but that
doesn't mean all of the other classes are a horrible fit for you. Maybe you
should try something along those lines, or try a new guild, or try changing
SOMETHING to shake things up. And if it's not worth it to you to do something
along those lines to stay in EQ, then yes, you're probably right when you say
your game is coming to an end. But that's ok, because you got done what you
wanted to get done, and you had fun, as you said.
