I posted this on another guild's board.  They were breaking up, and the
guild leader mentioned her disappointment of not being appreciated.  Since I
don't think many people know what it's like to be a guild leader I posted
the following.

Since I make it a practice not to identify myself in game beyond saying I
play on Zeb, you'll see a few edits but nothing major.

If you've ever thought of creating a new guild, here's some info you should
keep in mind. Let me preface this by saying that I have no idea how your
leadership does things...who the leaders are, officers, and their
responsibilities. If at ANY point anyone thinks "Dan Harmon says we're
stupid 'cause we're not doing it like HE does...and damnit there's always
lots of ways to do stuff!" get the first part out of your mind, and the
second is absolutely true.

Running a guild is a HELL of a lot of work and it's a thankless job (it IS a
job). Creating a new guild isn't just "invite folks and go." That was my
attitude when the four (originally) of us in <my guild> created our guild.

First week:
Figure out a name! This took us almost a day.
-        Go to www.google.com and do a search on your name to see if it has
any bad connotations.
-        Look at the initials and try to anticipate any bad jokes about it.
-        Try to come up with one that doesn't require outsiders to type in
your whole danged name to get a guild list.


We purposely went with a short name. It's our opinion that "Fellowship of
the Uber Butt Munchers" or "Knights of the Hidden Light" are just way too
stupid.what the heck are generic names like that supposed to MEAN, anyway
(and yeah, I have to admit that if you're reading this and belong to an "X
of the X" guild, I DO probably think your name is lame, sorry).

Find a website provider; probably buy a domain name (a few hours minimum)
Create a website to go with that domain (ditto on the time)
Create an ezboard (ditto)
Write a charter (ditto)
Beg friends to join (days, possibly)
Applying to EQ for guilding (an hour)
- First organizational event in-game; getting a minimum 10 people together
for guilding.

And that's just to START.

Message board access ALONE is a pain in the butt.  But on top of that;

- You're expected to read the vast majority of posts.
- You're expected to always be polite to all other guilds (you never know
when you might need them).
- You're expected to reach out to other guilds to form friendships, if not
alliances.

- You're expected to take a lot of tells from members and strangers with
questions or problems.
- You're expected to be happy and positive almost always. And if you're not,
you're expected to not bitch about something (diplomatically) without
including a solution.

If this sounds fun, you're nuts.

And then there are guild events. You're expected to lead unless you have
delegated this to another leader or officer but you're still expected to be
available to help them lead it if needed.

We're expected to make things happen. If folks seem to be farting
around...if things are static...the leader(s) have to say to themselves "ok,
something has to happen..." and PUSH folks into doing something. If you're
not the type of person who can push someone, you'd better have help from
someone who can.

That's all off the top of my head. It DOES get easier with practice,
especially if you're smart enough (again) to delegate. I don't do it all in
<my guild>...there's 3 GLs and if something is beyond one of us, one of the
others will take care of it. We take "breaks" as guild leaders to protect
our sanity. Our officers are a godsend.

The reward is a happy guild, and it's a wonderful reward, but I don't think
many people have any clue at all how hard our job is.
