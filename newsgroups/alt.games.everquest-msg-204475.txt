There you go. That's what it's worth to you then.

I've never paid for KEI, but then my only high level character is a 55th
level Enchanter, and while I can't KEI myself, I do have Clarity II which is
good enough with all my mana conservation equipment.

It's worth what you want to pay. If I get something like that for a
donation, I usually toss 50pp at them.

Ahh EQ needs the Starwars /tip command. Druid PotC's you and runs off at sow
speed? /tip druid 30. Of course I could see it being exploitable since in EQ
money has weight. Get on your horse, ride out of town, when you see the bard
run by swam kiting, /tip 0 0 0 50000... I'd pay 50 pp to see that.
