Hehe, guess that must include the 50+ people that STILL dont know how to 
use Loc, and havent bothered to train sense heading.
Meet those occasionally, usually i just tell them how to make a hotkey 
so they use sense heading when they kick/evade/whatever.

Even met a guy in Feerott once who needed a port. Waited around 20 min 
for him to find the ring, then ported out. If they cant bother to learn 
to use loc or max sense heading, i cant bother waiting for them to find 
me so they can get a port.
