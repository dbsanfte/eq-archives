Why not just let customers press one button and then watch as their
characters level up, gear up, and eventually destroy all who dare to
oppose their will?

Last I checked there was absolutely no requirement that anyone play
a Bard (which is a good thing, as I will never do so due to the
physical requirements you're complaining about here).

Me either.  I don't understand the attitude you're expressing here.
Some people can't play a Bard effectively in EQ because of physical
discomfort.  So what?  Some people can't do high-level raiding in
EQ because their lives do not allow for the time commitment.  By
the attitude you're applying to playing a Bard, SOE should change
the game so that we can kill dragons too, which is absurd.  I don't
care (much) about the parts of the game that are inaccessible to me,
whether you're talking about playing a Bard or going on 13 hour VT
raids.  I just wish they weren't so determined to utterly destroy
the sub-50 game, which is accessible to me.
