You get 46 and go on a planes raid.  You die while in the plane and
lose your level.  At this point, you cannot enter the plane normally
(ie, go through the portal in Ferrott to Fear), but you CAN be rezed
back into the plane.

Personally, if you get a good two or three bubbles of exp into 46,
you're more than far enough in.
