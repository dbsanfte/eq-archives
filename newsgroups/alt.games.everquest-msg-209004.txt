Pretty much any skill that you don't have at first level.  The only
exception to this I can think of off-hand is Channeling for hybrids,
for whatever reason they do not seem to need to train it even though
they don't get it until L8 (priest classes, who get it at L4, do
have to put a point into it).  BTW, I don't know this for sure in
the case of SKs, but I've played Rangers, Paladins, and a Beastlord,
and all had a non-zero Channeling skill the moment they dinged L8.
It used to be that you had to put a point into Taunt skill at L1
(only applies to WAR/PAL/SHD/RNG), which was the one exception to
the "if you can do it at L1 you don't need to train it" rule, but
there was a patch message recently claiming that they've finally
fixed that (only took 4-1/2 years).
