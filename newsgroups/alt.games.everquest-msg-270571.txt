Or right click on "My Computer" and select Manage. That takes you right 
to the "Computer Management" panel and saves you having to dick around 
with the retarded control panel classic/vs modern view confusion they 
added with XP. :)

Once your in disk management select the new disk, (it will be fairly 
obvious which one has no partitions or file systems)... right click on 
it and select 'partition' then after its partitioned the way you want, 
select format.

You'll want NTFS unless you know you don't.
