Killing in SS seems to only give plus kromZEK faction, while killing in Kael
harms both kromzek and KromIff (or whatever its called)

Further, as I noted, killing in SS is going exceptionally, exxtremely slowly in
terms of raising even that one faction.  I did several levels solely on killing
the entrance mobs near WL in my early 40s, and most of 51 on a long run up past
the maze nearly to the quest mob area, and I'm still dubious to both factions
of giants.

This is NOT a trivial exercise.  Perhaps killing in WW or TOV will help, I'm
finally almost at the minimum level my guild established for doing NTOV with
them (56) so I'll be able to check it out soon.

Also, does killing giants hurt KT faction?  Can KT faction be fixed without
killing coldain of either regular or Dain sort?
