Disease, Justice, Innovation, and Nightmare all have you zone in to the graveyard,
which is a spot with no random wanderers.  You aren't completely safe there, as
people do pull to there and train to there in some instances, but its about as
safe as you can hope for, a Brell of a lot safer than zoning into Fear or Hate for
example.

Further, none of those zones seem to have any undead near the zone in, nor much in
the way of see invis mobs nearby.  Belt and suspenders approach of zoning in to a
presumably safe spot while invis should take care of 99% of your worries.

PoD and PoI have zone out located literally in the graveyards.  PoN zone out is in
the building immediately next to the graveyard.  PoJ zone out is a bit of a
nuisance to find, but there don't seem to be any aggro mobs in the way.

Rumor has it that a similar situation exists in all the new planes; graveyard at
zone in is a safe spot, where a cleric can zone in and rez the bodies of the
fallen, who all pop there 10 minutes after death.  Course finding a cleric flagged
for the higher zones may be a bit more difficult.

For experience I'd look into Disease, near the zone there are rats and flies that
you should be able to solo, and I found the exp rate to be quite good even at 60
(at 61 most of them went cyan... and even so the exp doesn't suck)
