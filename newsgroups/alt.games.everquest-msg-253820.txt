> So, what does anyone know about Intimidate?


Found a post on allakazham which suggests that even though Intimidate is 
on a seperate timer, if any other combat skill is used during an 
intimidate attempt, it will fail.

I haven't been watching for this, and while I've punched intimidate 
quite regularly I also have been punching either kick or frenzy quite 
regularly, I wouldn't have a hard time believing that most of my 
intimidate attempts have been followed by a kick or frenzy.

Since intimidate takes some amount of time to go off, it would be pretty 
easy to interrupt if it this is correct.  The Allakazham post says this 
results in the "you're not scaring anybody" message, which I've 
certainly seen a lot.

Now, assuming this is true, still several questions:

1) does interrupting the attempt prevent a skill up check?  If so, then 
not interrupting might make the skill go up faster, which would be good, 
its gone up extremely slowly thus far

2) If No, then it should be much safer to raise the skill, because you 
can reliably click it for skill ups, just being sure to kick or frenzy 
immediately after so it doesn't actually work and potentially cause a 
ruckus, in those places where you don't want a fear sending your target 
out for friends, even at a snared speed.

3) what IS the timer on intimidate, exactly, and is there a fail message 
if you don't interrupt it (likely its the same as the interrupted fail 
message, but if its not, well, I don't recall seeing any other fail 
message, and I have had some successes, so I haven't been interrupting 
every try)

4) is it that the kick et al interrupt the attempt, or is it that a kick 
is an inherant part of an attempt, so if the kick button is greyed out 
during the attempt, that part can't be used so it fails?

This is different from what was suggested, an interrupt, in that if its 
true, might not be able to kick then immediately intimidate, and wait 
till intimidate attempt is over to kick again.

Or maybe you can, if the kick button has to be ungreyed when the 
intimidate ends, rather than when it begins, depending on timing

A) if kick grey out is shorter than intimidate casting duration, then 
kick followed immediately by intimidate will ungrey the kick in plenty 
of time.

B) if the kick grey out is longer, you could still kick, wait an 
appropriate time, then intimidate such that kick will still end before 
intimidate, this would probably be best on a hotkey

C) if kick has to be greyed out at the start but not at the end, then 
you could wait for both to ungrey, then intimidate and then kick (this 
contradicts what the OP on Alla was saying, though)

D) if kick is much much shorter than intimidate, you could even 
intimidate, kick, and have kick ungrey before completion, thus leaving 
both ends clear but sneaking a kick in the middle

I'm going to start by trying some mobs where I don't use kick or frenzy 
at all, and seeing how that goes, then try A thru D above and see if it 
changes anything.  Sadly, though, I'm lead to believe it still will go 
off so rarely that this experiment could take a long time at my skill 
level, so someone with a high intimidate would be better suited.
