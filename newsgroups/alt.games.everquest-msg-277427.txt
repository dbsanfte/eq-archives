Don't know when you left, but...

There has been a soloable giant in TS for some time now, same time they 
added the enraged bears.  Yes, it is just the one, which is a pain, but I 
completed a couple quests using him.  I soloed numerous gnolls in TS while 
they were green and low blue, all after the changes to make groups of mobs 
harder to solo.  I have also soloed numerous centaurs, all designated group 
encounters, while they were blue/green.
