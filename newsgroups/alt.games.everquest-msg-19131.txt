Sigh.

Biz, I work in the "oil industry".  If you think that "excessive
profits" there are "pretty much proven", then you only prove the
wisdom of your "pretty much based on stupidity" assessment for
such pronouncements.

The oil industry is one of those that go through periodic
"boom and bust" cycles.  You can't properly assess whether
a given year's profits are "excessive" without taking into account
the years when things were dismal.  For a while the joke was:

   Q:  How do you get an oil company executive out of a tree?
   A:  Cut the rope.

Oil exploration and development is an ENORMOUSLY expensive and
risky undertaking.  For every time you make what looks like
"excessive profits", you've had a long string of expensive
failures.

And this year's "profit" is going to be mostly spent next
year on further exploration and development.

I should know, my job is to write computer programs that help
oil companies track their risk, and make intelligent decisions
about how not to piss away another hundred million dollars
of company money while looking for enough oil to keep the
company running beyond next year.  I also write software
that tracks their existing cashflows, and thus I know that
their rate-of-return after investments, operating expenses,
and taxes (i.e., DIRECT production costs, NOT even including
company overhead) is hardly enough to make everyone want to
flock to the oil business these days.

One good illustration of how misleading "excessive profits"
in the oil industry can be is the favorite example used by
a consultant who is a proponent of Portfolio Management analysis.
He goes to oil company managers and asks them hypothetically,
"would you like to discover a new field like the XXX field?"
(he names one of the most famous and most profitable oilfield
success stories of all time).  "Sure!", replies the manager.
How about two of them?  "Wow, yeah!".  What if you found
five of them tomorrow?  "Gee, that'd be great!"

"Congratulations", he tells them, "you have now committed
your company to two billion dollars of development
investment over the next five years, and you won't see
your first penny of positive cashflow until year six, how
do you intend to survive until then?"
