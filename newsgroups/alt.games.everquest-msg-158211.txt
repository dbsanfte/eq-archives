I would definately start over from scratch. I've done it once already
(retiring a 53 Monk and 51 Druid) when I moved to the FV server. I am
not saying the situation wouldn't suck to the Nth power, or that I
wouldn't be angry and a little sick over the loss.. 

For me the fun in EQ is the journey not the destination.
