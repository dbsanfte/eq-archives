Hate the new bazaar.  My sales are off considerably since DoN released. 
  Some of that I can put down to a new expansion being out... always 
happens, but every buyer I've talked to in the last week has struggled 
to find traders in the new bazaar, so I think a lot of it is the new bazaar.

It's not the layout, although being forced to run much further slows the 
whole process down considerably.  The biggest reason is that FIND fails 
routinely to find a trader.  Add to it that the normal maps that 
everyone downloaded in the past conflict with the new map, and that the 
portals transport you behind the next portal, so that if you're on 
autorun you get into a loop... nobody likes it on my server.
