Cool! Thanks for the advice. I have tried ToFS with my druid and loved
the place... although by the time my party went there, the first floor
was a little low for us. Cougars in IC are not bad exp either,
although if you are not careful, add can be a big problem. They seem
to have a wide argo radius when your beating on one of their friends.
I think I might give Dalnir's Crypt a shot as I have never been there!

Thanks again!
