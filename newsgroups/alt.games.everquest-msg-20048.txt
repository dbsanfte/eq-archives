was camping the glacier bear for my totemic helm
spent over a week in there, dying about 15 times all total to the damn lich
finally had spawn down after about 2 days, hitting it at 8 hour intervals
and taking out placeholders
finally got the damn bear
partner logged on about 8 hopurs later, warrior still camped in the cave, so
back in again i went to EB him out
while we coming out, glacier bear popped again right in front of us, 2 pelts
in 8 hours, 2500pp for second helm
all in all, nice quest experience
