The sneak and hide abilities of halflings are a racial ability and as such
does not move from their initial stating skill of 50 in each. The only class
(regardless of race) that can improve their sneak and hide skill to any
usefulness is the rogue class.

So for those that have sneak and hide as racial ability it is just a
somewhat useful thing. Sneak can be used to reset a bad faction to
indifferent, if you position yourself behind the npc you need to fool (be it
a vendor for better prices or a quest npc for a turnin) and hit the sneak
key and /con the npc, if he is still giving you a message that he hates you
hit the key again until you get indifferent as the /con message.

Hide can be used to atleast be a little safer if you need to rest for a
while in hostile territory, but be wary of mobs and npc's that see through
invisibility (hiding counts as invisibility for game mechanics purposes). Do
the same thing as with sneak, target a mob or npc, hit the hide button and
then /con to see if you succeeded.
