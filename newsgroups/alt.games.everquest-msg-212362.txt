My son claims that the recent patches on EQ cause problems with him trying to 
connect with the servers to play while using Windows XP. Within seconds of 
hitting the "Play Everquest" button, he gets disconnected.

Looking through here, I don't see a single message about connection problems 
using XP, but yet he can't stay connected. He claims there are others who 
point the finger at XP. A friend of his who uses Win98 doesn't have any 
problems.

He's played for a couple years so he's not really a newbie at this. There 
haven't been any hardware changes on his system for a while. The poor kid is 
still using a 1 Ghz Duron and a Radeon 7500.
