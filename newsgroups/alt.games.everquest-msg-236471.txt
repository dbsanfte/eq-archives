if you're only 23 and they are asking you for stuff then they probably
really are new.

as for people who ask me for things I dunno, I never check their levels.
doesnt really happen very much, usually when it does its people asking if I
have any old beastlord gear, since thats what I play.

I get more tells asking me what they *should* be wearing, than asking me for
stuff to wear, though. much more annoying in my opinion.
