There's your answer right there.

The Account keys for EQ:SoL were taped to the cardboard CD holder that
came with the packaged version when I bought mine back in December. I
am willing to bet that EQ:Gold was packaged the same way.. Obviously
someone bought the box you wound up with, stole the CD holder with the
account keys, and then returned it to the store. The store then
re-shrink-wrapped the package (which is why you saw the security tag
under the s/w) and sold it to you as if it was new. Looks like you
need to take it back and demand an exchange.
