Go to The Elddar Grove gate and just to the left of it is a small
sign. Click on the sign and you get an application. Examine the
application and follow the prompts to get the tokens for citizenship.
For The Baubbleshire quest you go to the caves. Go to the dock in The
Baubbleshire and ring the bell that takes you outside of Qeynos. You
may need to scroll down to see The Cave. When you get the 5 tokens
click on the sign again and it will take you to an instanced area for
the final part of the test.
