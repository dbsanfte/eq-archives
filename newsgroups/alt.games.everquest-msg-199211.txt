Not necessarily.  You have to generate a fair bit more damage to have
a single slow weapon outagro a pair of fast weapons.  In my example
above the Argent Protector will outdamage the Lamentation plus Jade
Mace combo, but it will not outagro it.  Your WGBS is quite a bit
faster and has significantly more damage output than the AP, so it
is able to overwhelm the extra agro produced by the larger number of
hits form the dual combo.

Don't underestimate the significance of fast dual weapons.  Another
issue you should be aware of is proc effects.  You are into the levels
where Monks and Rogues outdamage Warriors noticeably, and they do so
with fast dual weapons (plus Backstab for the Rogue).  The extra hate
generated by weapon procs is (typically) necessary for high level
Warriors to hold agro.  So the +hate proc on half of the Warrior epic
and some other weapons, Snare procs, Stun procs, plus DoT and DD procs
on some weapons are important considerations.  As another poster said,
you should try the Steel Warrior site for a lot more information:
