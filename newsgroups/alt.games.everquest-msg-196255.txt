Personally I think they should do away with the coin system in EQ2, I
believe it would be a better idea to just have a value of trade put to items
we find and or make via suggested value but no coinage used at all, just use
things like gems and or food, furs, gold nuggets etc. which can be found or
beaten off creatures, or even forged or mined.

Just a thought, what do you all think about it?

Oh and on a last note, I really hope they put useful things in like wagon's
for horses to carry a lot more goods etc, and homes to store stuff and
decorate to attract mobs you can hunt for useful items on a regular basis.
