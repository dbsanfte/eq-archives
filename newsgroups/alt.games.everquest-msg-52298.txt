So what's his hurry? Does he believe he is racing the kiddie for some
reason? If so, then as I said, he's an idiot.

In general, X time spent in-game will result in rewards appropriate
for the time spent. It doesn't matter if those X hours happen all in
one day, or are spread out over a week, or a month.

Time = Progress, equally, for everyone.
Buy PP for real-world money is not an option available equally to all.
