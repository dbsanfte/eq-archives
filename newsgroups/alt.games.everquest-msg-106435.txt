Mostly luck of the draw, I see nearly no resists on any of the magic based
dots (stinging swarm/creeping crud/drones of doom/drifting death, and later
Winged Death).

The reason people seem to complain a lot about immolate is that the magic
dots have a  relatively low resist rate compared to any other (non lure
based) spell, whereas immolate is more normalized on the resist rate.
As a test, pick something that isn't particularly fire resistant, root/rot
it using the level 5 root and no dot but immolate, count resists out of
casts, repeat, only quad the same thing, count resists per hit (ie 4 hits
per cast) the rate should be similar.
