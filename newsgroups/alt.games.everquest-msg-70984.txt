I saw where you said that Win98 doesnt like your NIC.  So what?  It isnt the
only OS out there either.  Whether you had a reason to upgrade or not, you
should have been prepared for the eventuality.  You save money to fix your
car.  You save money to fix your house.  So, save money to "fix" your
entertainment.

I am not placing blame on people who run, or ran, Win95.  All I am saying is
that people should be preparing for what they know is coming.
