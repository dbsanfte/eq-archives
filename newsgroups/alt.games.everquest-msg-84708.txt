Yes, this sounds like a classic virus infection to me.  Scan and clean 
as soon as possible.

However it's barely possible it's something else, like a hard drive 
problem or an old version of some part of EQ.  I had something like this 
happen for a day or two soon after Luclin came out and I downloaded a 
new version of the patcher from http://eqlive.station.sony.com/ (see the 
section "Unable to Download Files with the New Patcher").  That fixed 
the problem for me.

You could also try the thorough file scan on the patcher if you haven't 
already, and it might be good to use scandisk or something similar to 
check your drive for problems.  If you get really desperate you could 
copy the entire EverQuest directory from your wife's machine to yours. 
You'd want to take precautions to keep your machine from infecting the 
other machine with a virus of course.
