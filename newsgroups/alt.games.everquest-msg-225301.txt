So, what you're saying is, all casters can buy 3 hour long haste spells.
Yes, this would be part of the reason why they've become overpowered.   They
can get all the benefits of having grouped with an enchanter, without
actually adding the enchanter to the group.

Sorry, no.

Which would be why charm is still majorly overpowered.

And your problem is that you're looking at unrealistic numbers.   My level
65 Rogue sure as hell isn't doing 2200 damage every 8 seconds, just from
backstab.  Thats 275 damage per second you're claiming she can do, before
even counting her normal melee.

/boggle.

No wonder you think melees far outdamage casters.

Under ideal conditions, with raid level buffs, counting *all* melee, not
just backstab, she did an average of 150~ish damage per second in BoT.    In
an actual raid situation, killing Maestro in Hate the other night, I parsed
in at slightly under 100 DPS, as I was constantly losing attacks due to
getting pushed out of range or off to the side instead of the rear.  If the
wizards weren't outdamaging me there, it was because they were sleeping.

And we won't even get into what happens with the absurdly high AC on Luclin
raid mobs.
