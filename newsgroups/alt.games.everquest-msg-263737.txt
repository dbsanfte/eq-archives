I'm looking forward to trying it out.  If it goes well, and I like the
crafting system, I think I'll be going with EQ2 as opposed to WoW.  I
like crafting, and am looking forward to trying a system that actually
rewards care and attention while making items.

And with the increased difficulty in crafting, crafters will be able
to name their prices for the higher end items...
