Hi all,

Just begun my first alt after playing a cleric. Decided to go for a barb
warrior (named Heldark) in the hope that I would spend less time on my
backside in battle. One of my pet hates as a cleric is when a mob switches
attack between characters making heals more difficult to judge. Therefore I
want Heldark to be a good tank and hold aggro but Im not sure what the best
ways are to do this:

Taunt - I guess this should be as high as possible.

Attack - This is where Im a little foggy. Should I go for a 2-hand high
damage hi delay or dual wield with lo damage lo delay weapons?

Slam/Kick - Does using this affect the delay time for primary and offhand
weapons or can I safely use this as often as possible?

Pulling - is it better to pull the mob to maintain aggro or get someone else
to do it and not waste my own hp initially (ie the mob will focus on the
first attacker unless aggro builds from elsewhere).

Range weapons - are range weapons more likely to deviate the mob from the
MT?

At the minute Heldark is only L10 but any hints for the road ahead would be
greatly appreciated. Thanks.

Andrew
