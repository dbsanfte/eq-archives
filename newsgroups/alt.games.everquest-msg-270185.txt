Well... perhaps I'm over thinking it... but it made sense to me. In that 
I wouldn't be able to stop and rummage the bodies for items if I'm 
running for my life... so even though I killed the two gnolls and ran 
from the 3rd I get no credit because I didn't stick around.

This would work best if the encounter was only lootable when you 
finished it... i don't know if that's the case or not.
