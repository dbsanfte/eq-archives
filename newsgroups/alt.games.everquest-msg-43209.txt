I play regularly with a chanter (LVL 58) who never has, and never will
use macros. And as the puller in his groups, we have a great little
system worked out. I dont attack anything till he says to. I pull 5-6
mobs at a time as a normal pull, stand and wait for mez, move, stand,
waiti for mez etc, until all the mobs are mezzed. Then we get down to
business. He uses a basic F8 mez which works faultlessly as long as
the loose mobs are moved towards him.

I guess I am saying that no ammount of macros will help you if the
group doesnt already have a system worked out. Figure out how you like
your mobs presented for mez on multis and tell the puller and the
cleric/healer what you want. Call the mob you want killed next until
the main assist knows what to pick automatically.

IMHO Macros are just more spam. If you are good at your job (and it
seems you are) you won't need them any more than a cleric needs to
macro his heals.
