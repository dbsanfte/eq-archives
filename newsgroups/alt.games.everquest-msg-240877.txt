I suspect this guy wishes to exploit the game, in which case if they openly
(and of their own free will) attack one another cant be exploited.

If im correct in my assumption, he wants mobs that are NOT kos to each
other, but simply on a different faction and will therefor cause a war when
charmed and forced to do battle (and charm breaks while the battle is
commenced, usually due to a caster finishing the spell after charm is broke)
