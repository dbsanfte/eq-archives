This is true, and, the key droppers can decide not to spawn for a
stupidly long time just to twart you.

Also remember to never, ever step on a rug.

The key dropper in the West wing is one of these situations, IIRC.

If you decide to try this with a duo, you're going to need to make a
multiday trip out of it I think. You'll need a gate potion every day and
you'll need to duel in the bazaar arena and store the key you've gotten
on the corpse until you log in the next day. I can't think of any safe
spots you could camp in any of the wings, and I spent a lot of time in
N, W, and S wings prior to PoP. I played there with a friend who played
a 60 chanter. At the end we had 58 wizard and warrior bots and the east
wing was still a bit too much for us with that foursome.
