 It mearly addresses the comment about pricing which you obviously know
nothing about. I am sorry if you don't understand NBTs , but it pretty well
shows that you shouldn't shoot your mouth off about cost when you know so
little about simple accounting.

As far as doing it myslef, I am perfectly capable. I am also capable of
replacing the engine in my new car. Does that mean I should just do it
because I can ? Is that why I paid BMW all that money for, so I could fix
it?

 Yea baby, you were a service tech for DTV. lol, man I wish I was as smart
as you.
