ahh.. yes, but cost of living has gone up, and I am assuming all of there
programmers want raises/bonuses/etc just like you and I after a while.
Maybe the service isn't that great, but at least 99% of the time when I want
to get on I can.  $12.95/month...big deal, a LOT of highschool kids in my
area make that in a little over an hour of work and I live in north
dakota...you can't tell me it's gonna affect you drastically.  If it
does...BECOME A GUIDE...FREE EQ and maybe you will get the chance to talk
with people who CAN make the game better.
