Whether it is her opinion or not, by that statement I feel she is trying to
tell people what is (or is not in this case) an acceptable way to spend
money, which is what Michael was upset about.

It doesn't matter if she is quoting law, suggesting creating one, or just
stating her own personal beliefs. By calling people who buy pp idiots, I
believe she is trying to tell them that they shouldn't (not can't - but
shouldn't) spend money on.

You know, as I said in another branch of this thread, it all boils down to
the same word you brought up here - opinion. I said it to Biz, and I'll say
it again, opinions are really only important to the people that have them,
and those that respect them. In the long run, if we are dealing with
opinions, everybody is right. Including me and you. )

Good talking to you th (by the way, where did that name come from?)
