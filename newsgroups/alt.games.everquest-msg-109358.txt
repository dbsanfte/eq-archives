    Our clerics have been making healing macros to take this into account.
Suppose Divine Light is spell 6, and for some reason you have to tell both
your group and channel lcch that you're casting it. This is what our macro
looks like:

/cast 6
/g Divine Light on >> %t <<
/cast 6
;#lcch Divine Light on >> %t <<
/cast 6

    The important part is the repeated /cast 6. With three attempts at
casting the spell it generally WILL cast, so there's no significant delay
between when you say you're healing and when you actually heal. I imagine
anyone else having fizzle issues could set up spell macro hotkeys like this
to make sure they get one-touch casts.
