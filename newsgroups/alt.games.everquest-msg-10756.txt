Sounds like you met a rogue who just turned 51.  Lockpick
skill goes up to 202, and you can hide and pick the FP bank
door at 201 skill.  It's a "right of passage" to lock somebody
in the bank vault and taunt them before letting them out.

PS:  Did I mention this is a "right of passage" for asshole
rogues? This is a difference breed than many of the regular
rogues in the world...
