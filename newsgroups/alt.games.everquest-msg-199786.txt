My beastlord is 52 and has been soloing most his life, if you are not too
attached to your warrior maybe you would consider a Sk/Bst combo, fear FD
and snare is not to be under-estimated.

But if you want exp I would say your fastest root would be ...

1-4     - Qeynos newbie zone
5-8     - PC the SWT side
9-15   - Kurns tower
16-22 - PC Shiknar
23-25 - PC Bandits
26-30 - Echo caverns Needlites.
31-35 - Dawnshroud Shroom fort
36-45 - Mines of Nurga
46 +   - Jagged Pine forest Poachers

Your going to want to stay well stocked up on bandages because even with Kei
your going to find Beastlord heals are not going to keep up with the HP of a
warrior.
Also FoL (Flash of light) is good taunt, handy for agrro kiting or just
giving the pet time to grab the taunt away from a half dead warrior =)
