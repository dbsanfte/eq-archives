ogre SK is the best SK, cheers !

have fun !   it should be a great character

and don't worry about skills, especially since the new "get to lvl 10 in
like 3 hours" patch. . . work them and they'll catch up fine (2hs ! 2hs !
damage ! !)


your ogre can't 'accidentally' attack another darkie

yes, you can heal/buff other teams

player economy is different from (pvp)server to (pvp)server, but a few
things stay the same . . .

-transactions are mostly done at banks, most often with mule (under lvl 6)
characters

-trades are (in all my time in pvp) preferred to cash . . . you see more
"WTT classX gear for classY" than you see straight selling . . . too many
horror stories about so-and-so losing 15k to pvp . . . but then again, i
could be totally off since the advent of luclin
