no that reward doesn't vary.  That compass came in handy before they put 
the UI compass in, it's still useful at lower levels when sense heading 
is still crappy.  Not much money making in Sharvahl.  Sell silks in the 
bazaar for some quick cash at your level.  You'll need a few more levels 
to do well at the aqua goblin camps in Butcherblock.  I think they can 
be done at 10 or so.
