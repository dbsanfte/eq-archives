While I can't argue with your preferences, I can say there are many
who differ on it.  And when trying to entice enough players to hit the
first M in MMORPG, it's better to appeal to those who want to play
crafters with a quality (optional) crafting system than it is to
neglect them entirely by shuffling it off to a background event that
appeals only to a small few who want to play an Adventurer and still
have the rewards of being a crafter.

Of course, the best option would be a system that lets you do your
background crafting in a way that doesn't interfere with the niche of
a devoted crafter.  That would require putting some limits on what you
can do in the background as opposed to what a devoted crafter could do
in-game.

Eh.  While it might make a money-sink, that isn't what tradeskills are
supposed to be.  Nor should most characters be both Master Craftsmen
and Elite Adventurers;  interactive tradeskills are meant to appeal to
those who want to be the Master Craftsperson in a world of
Adventurers.
