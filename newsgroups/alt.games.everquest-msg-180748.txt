COming in on Martin's side for once...

I'll admit I boggled at this one myself. As a halfling cleric my CHA was
almost rock-bottom but a couple of opal-encrusted steins took care of that
long ago.

Monks are doubly handicapped by their weight penalties. I always loved
pairing with monks because they *asked* me to ninja-loot. I would offer
to do a gold/plat swap and/or give them half the final loot total in plat,
but they wouldn't often take me up on it.

Rez is a money-maker to some degree, though I sometimes turn down the
donation. It's not easy to make money from, however, as you usually need
to travel for it, and as such can burn time pretty seriously. As for
money from buffs... used to be Aego was a payer in a small way, now it's
Virtue, but I need to hit those levels first.
