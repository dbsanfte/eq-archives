I think the big point of confusion on this (at least for me and
guildmates wrestling with this question) is the "entirely different
account" thing. We've had cases where the deceased would log off, then
log on a different character *on the same account* to search out rez
help. Then, if it took  a few hours, they would log on the original
character only to find the corpse was unrezzable and the cleric dragged
all over the world for nothing. :-(
