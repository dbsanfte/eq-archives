Wow. Well all I can say is your epic experience (and to some extent
your guild experience) is very different to the one I know. I'm the
first to admit that the druid epic isnt exactly hard, but with my guild,
and the two guilds we're allied with, we've had some great fights,
encounters, bonding experiences etc with the various epics. We're
at the stage now where we have a cross-guild strike force set up to
help people with epic pieces, and they're just now beginning to start
being completed. No 18 month level caps, no 12 hour camps... just
people helping each other. It pretty much defines our (mid to high)
end game right now, in fact. I guess its a case of YMMV, if you
don't think the RvR is sufficiently high, then I guess there's planar
loot *shrug*
