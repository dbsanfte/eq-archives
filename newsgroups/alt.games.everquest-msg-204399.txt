Hmm, that multiple mobs on the pet thing might explain a wipe we had
on a bad overpull a week or so ago.  Had two BSTs in the party and
both of the pets broke mez during the battle, kinda made it impossible
to keep the poor Necro alive and the rest of us followed soon after.
The oddest thing was seeing a BST Warder corpse when we got rezzed back
in a couple minutes later by a nearby cleric (beginning to seem like
karma is everything in this game, we've CRd quite a few strangers and
received same consideration a few times now).
