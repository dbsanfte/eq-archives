Nope.  I was having real problems even with the cable modem.  JPF was so laggy
it was like a slide show.  Forget the moon.  It takes  ages to get around up
there.

For example there is no difference in lag  in the PoK   going from  port store
to stone.   Whether dial up or Cable modem,  it was  very much like a slide
show. WIth both I have to face the wall and  try to  navigate that way.

Thank you for asking that clarifying question.

Awaiting enlightenment.
