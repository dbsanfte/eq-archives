One way Microsoft uses their proprietary file formats is to force
upgrades. Now again, a lot of people might just consider this good
business, but when you basically have a monopoly as Microsoft does,
forcing people to upgrade by, for example, making your new version of
Word output files that aren't readable in older versions (or anyone
else's software) could be considered an abuse of that position.

In companies I've worked for, I've seen entire departments forced to
upgrade to the newest Word or Office just because they expanded, ordered
some new computers, and got the latest Office installed because
Microsoft also refuses to provide OEM's with older versions once they
release a new one. After a few weeks of the people with the new
computers shipping around documents no one can read, and of course you
can't tell Office to default to saving in the old format, you have to
specify it every time you save a file, most companies just bite the
bullet and upgrade everyone, dispite the new release not adding one iota
of value to the business, other than eliminating the problem with the
older versions.

It's going to be interesting to see what happens with the growing number
of countries other than the US now mandating open source solutions for
government documents. Because contracters wanting to do business with
these governments will need to submit their proposals and communications
in an interoperable format, there's going to be more pressure on
Microsoft to be interoperable or these companies will move away from
Microsoft software to software that can interoperate. Microsoft reached
it's current dominance of the market because people bought what everyone
else used, in order to be able to exchange files easily. With a
government mandated open format in place, that will no longer be the
case unless Microsoft opens theirs up, and somehow, I think their usual
trick of opening up one version then breaking it for everything but
their software the next won't cut it when dealing with government
purchasing offices.

Another place that's liable to cause Microsoft problems is schools.
Equipping schools with enough computers for all the students is a costly
venture, and with all the cutbacks in funding for education, even the
"deals" Microsoft provides for schools really aren't that cheap.

Anyway, totally off topic for a gaming newsgroup anyway.
