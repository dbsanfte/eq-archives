I have a troll warr and a human ranger.  Both are their upper thirties and
are my highest level characters.  I really want to focus on getting one to
60+.  Which do you think will be the most useful in groups at highest
levels?  Which would you focus on?

Opinions from those that have played 50+ chars appreciated.
