No, but a Nostromo n52 might do well in most combat.

This has been one of my peeves about the game so far. It seems to 
require no skill whatsoever from me (level 22 Wiz). You have only a 
few useful spells and combat consists of mashing those few keys. One 
of those bobbing bird toys could be just as successful as me in 
combat. While casting in EQLive was somewhat tedious to keep skills 
up, it did distinguish those that did from those that didn't in the 
mid-levels of the game. Here skill ups come automatically on leveling 
and also in between levels.

I've mentioned the conning and pulling of mobs before, you always know 
exactly what will come and what will not. The up/down arrows or lack 
thereof always tell you what to expect at any level. No "Man, Dorn is 
only light blue, he's all mine" here. You know he'd hand you your butt 
under the EQ2 conning system.
