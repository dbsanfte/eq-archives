I have not tried ShowEQ, but i have tried Snort in vmware, at "Bridged
networking"... Snort is a utility to capture attempts to break in to systems
by analyzing low level packets that travel the network..

I believe that there should be no reason why this would not work with ShowEQ
as well.., but i really think you should need some kind of router or
similar, so that theese to adapters are on the same network.. ie it wont
work with Dial-up or some dsl modems i think..
