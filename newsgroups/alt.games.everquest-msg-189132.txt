why? it's a very small city with almost everything, so it's practical to
have good faction there.
2nd in thurg is the place for the coldain prayer shawl quests. (8 in total)
3rd there are several other quests including velious armour quests.
4th the armor you need for it drops in kael drakkel wich means you will blow
up faction with the giants anyway.
5th if you kill queen drachnia in cc, you can use the scepter of the coldain
ancients for kromriff military leggings. Wich has great stats.
6 ask somebody else for more reasons. :-)
