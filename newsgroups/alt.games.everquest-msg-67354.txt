you could also do some soloing in SolA...the XG that drops the charred
guardian shield and bp would be very easy for you to take and that's 500pp
for either loot.

also...you should definately join and guild and start getting in on some
plane raids for indicolite armor....or you could start looking for pick up
groups in velks for gems for thurg quest armor...winning rolls on anything
in there is good money and a lot of the crystal chitin stuff would be major
upgrades from your crafted.
