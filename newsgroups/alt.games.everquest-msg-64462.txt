Well, I got all the upgrades installed on my machine.  Got the patch
downloaded and then started EQ up.  Looks like even the non Lucil version
now won't run correctly.

I hope my new video card arrives today becuase my current video card isn't
supported.  Seems, somehow, that they managed to outmode my cad.

Thing that suprises me is that I can log on to server, I can play fine
except for one thing -- the transparent colors (not polygons) used for items
and text (such as custom socials but not fixed action upttons such as
Spell -or- Bash) appear with a solid black background.  This is the ONLY
glitch I've hit and I can't get rid of it.  Zoning, etc...  Eveything is
fine.  Just the stupid background color for things is shot.

Bummer.  I'll be offline until I get the card now.
