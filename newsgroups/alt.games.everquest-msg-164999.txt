The only problem is, you have to follow Inny.  Seriously, that's what keeps
me from playing a necro, I can't stand any of the three available deities.
The moment they allow a necro to follow Zek, I'm starting one.  (Hell, it
can even be in character "You were weak and worthless in life, but maybe you
will be of more use to Lord Zek in death.")
