    If No Drop items have value beyond their equipment value, people will 
continue to farm them well after they should have moved on. "Well, if we do 
Time we might get some items that people want, we can gear the recruits a 
bit, and we can tribute the rest! I don't think we'll ever stop doing this 
zone!" I sometimes wish that I could pass my old droppables down to my alts, 
or tribute it, but if I could it would be bad for the game.
