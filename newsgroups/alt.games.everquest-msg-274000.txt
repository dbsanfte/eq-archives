You've demonstrated no such thing.  In fact, the evidence for its
meaning a coward being based on both sexist and vulgar references
is pretty overwhelming.  Hell, you did it yourself when you
you said "if you have the balls".  In our culture calling someone
womanly is tantamount to calling them a coward.  The most recent
version of this is, of course, Girlie-Man.

If she's interested in WoW I hope she asks people with a clue and
a braincell with which to apply it rather than proven idiots like
yourself.  Considering her past history, I'd wager she'll be able
to learn what little you know about it within a few minutes of
logging on.

As for the supposed "all men are bastards" - in the 5+ years she's
posted on AGE I've never seen that.  What we have seen is a low
tolerance for stupidity.
