Actually, according to the EQTC site, Poisoning and Alchemy ARE
available there, for Rogues and Shaman only, respectively.  Just
like Tinkering is available for Gnomes.  I haven't actually done
any of these specialised skills there, though.  (Or anywhere
else, though I do hope to get into Tinkering soon.)

I did overlook Fishing, I admit.  It's not free to skill it up in
Abysmal Sea.  However, it's very nearly free: for the price of the
bait and the occasional replacement pole, you can get crabs and
tuna that are worth a plat a pound if turned in for tribute.  (You
have to break them down in a mixing bowl to get one-pound chunks,
worth 1 tribute each, else you only get about 1/2 tribute per
pound.  I've found it best to wait until I'm standing near the
Tribute Master before getting out the mixing bowl.)  And fishing
also leaves you time to do other stuff, like practice spells or
some skills.  (You can feign death AND try to intimidate an NPC in
about the time it takes to do one round of fishing.  I've got it
on a hotkey. :-)
