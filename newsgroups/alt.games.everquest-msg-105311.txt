Where are you now? I would assume the Qeynos area since you must all
be together.

Work on the Large/Giant Bats, Gnoll watchers, and Gnolls in Qeynos
hills until you hit 8-9. Do the Gnoll fang quest. Also hunt the Rabid
Wolves and turn their pelts in to Preistess Caluria in the UFO in town
for great exp. Once you hit 8-9 you can camp the thugs down in the
Qeynos sewers or head into Blackburrow for some old fashioned gnoll
hunting.
