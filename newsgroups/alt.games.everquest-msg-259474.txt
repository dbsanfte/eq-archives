I used to see Alpha Loot a lot back a few years ago, but gradually the 
practice seems to have died out in favor of the ML plan.

Trouble with Alpha on valuables is that it favors the people with names 
beginning early in the alphabet; something I was familiar with from 
grade school days due to the last name of Berg.

You saw a lot of people with names like Alanaon, Ablerue, even Aardmore, 
and very few people named Zebulon.

This is because if you are in a group of six and a loot drops, the guy 
with an early alpha name gets it... then he can leave whenever he likes. 
  Meanwhile the guy with the late alpha name keeps seeing other people 
get the drops and he's stuck, if he has to leave for any reason he's not 
going to get his share at all, and likewise if the group itself peters 
out before the sixth drop, he's screwed.

ML tends to favor the looter as well, because he never has to leave 
without a split, while often other people end up doing just that, not 
because nobody will do it, but because they just can't be bothered. 
Mind you the ML should never leave without splitting... but when he does 
split he gets a share at least!
