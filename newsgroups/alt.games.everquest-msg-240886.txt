Well, that might be a bit strong.  How about, "we generally don't dislike 
him." :)

Vipers are useful.  They eat the rats.  But then, they don't generally 
leave messy rabid rat carcasses around, flailing about the newsgroup.

Dealing with our local vipers is no problem.  Perhaps you just need an 
enchanter.  Cast alliance on them a couple times, pacify as necessary, 
keep your fire resist up... and if you -do- happen to aggro them, just 
remember to mem blur.  But they're here, and they're not going to just 
despawn, you know.

Besides, Ben (et al) so owned your butt in the "bottom poster getting 
caned" thread.  Just get over it and move on.

}Don't read it 

You will find that "Don't read it" is a suggestion that is rarely 
appreciated.  Those who choose to follow that advice generally already 
killfiled you and/or Ben.  The rest of us have our reasons for not doing 
so.

}and I am helping in other threads,

Yes, this is true.  I've seen at least two actually bonafide helpful posts 
from you today.  I was tempted to follow up with, "Good job!" or the like, 
to mark your fabulous accomplishment.  To save wear and tear, though, I'll 
just do it here.

Good job!

Now, if you can increase the number of those posts, and decrease the 
number of pointless flailing-about-with-flames posts and posts involving 
nationalistic bigotry, you might really be on to something.
