	The rogues have people from Verant posting to their boards on their own
time.

	That hasn't been true for Rangers since Brian Hook left the EQR mailing
list (long before he left the company).  (McQuaid played a Ranger into the
mid-20s and then abandoned it; he's never been involved with the Ranger
community and doesn't do much on the game directly any more.  Certainly he has
no hands-on experience with the class at high levels and thus no real
understanding of our issues.)

	This inevitably shows up in class balance.  Rogues are doing fine because
there are people on staff who are passionate about them.  Rangers have no such
advocate and have to scream bloody murder to get their issues addressed.
While Hook was engaged with the Ranger community he got us the Short Sword of
Morin (great mid-level weapon) and Orc Impaler (good substitute for the
Traincaller even if it took them forever to input the quest data), he got our
Parry cap raised when he found a typo had it set too low, got our Dodge cap
raised, got us the eight-slot Fletching kit and silver arrows, and had input
into the Ivy Etched quest series (and took our concerns to the team when the
quests were being drawn up).

	He didn't even WORK on EQ.  He was doing graphics engine work for future
Verant products.  Kendrick, very visible on Safehouse, is a main designer for
Velious.  So what kind of influence on Rogue class balance does he have?

	Obviously there's some favoritism and internecine politics at work.  The
answer is not to tell Verant employees not to post to message boards or
mailing lists (which would not solve the problem) but for the "tuning team" to
keep in mind that they are dealing with human beings, who act for their own
reasons, and to try to keep personal agendas from cluttering the issues.
