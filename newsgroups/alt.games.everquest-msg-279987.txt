Use corpse summoner,death is meaningless in EQ.

And it requires long waits for groups to do the long xp grinds.

Use corpse summoner,death is meaningless in EQ.

Yes,and SOE supporting this mind set,caging in all players in one zone
which gives the best xp,leaving the explorers or people who like some
variety(me) in the cold,or why is the xp in places like Veksar,Droga
etc. so horrible?

Even more adventurous types like me are driven away from out of the
way places,cause the xp there is laughable compared to the latest
expansion,way to go Sony,I will never buy another expansion,I dont
like to be blackmailed.

Sure,you have to be level 70 to enjoy the game.  :p

Nice,instead of adding content and fixing bugs,we get another graphics
update,remember the last one?  :p

>> EQ is a very-slowly-dying game. 

One can wonder why SOE doesnt simply pull the plug,instead of
making it so that more and more players cancel,with half the the 
players now than 2 years ago it cant be very profitable,maybe
they are hoping for EQ players slowly move to EQ2? :p
