Here's the big secret...the big advice...better write this one down or print
a copy of this e-mail...IT MIGHT SAVE YOUR LIFE.

Watch where you're going...don't walk into a spider.

That's it. :)  FV doesn't have to be that scary but it certainly does
require that you pay attention.

Another tip though, having nothing to do with the spiders:  DO NOT GO
ANYWHERE NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE STREAM.  That's where a particularly nasty
iksar necro (or maybe SK...something nasty anyway) by the name of Vekis
hangs out.  He summons (immediately brings you to him) if you get on his
Hate list.
