I wish I could say it was only one druid in the group (all 18-19 so no wolf
form), but there were 3 and NONE of them thought about the other 3.  We had
to keep telling them, but the problem was it would drop either while medding
(and I missed the message) or just before a fight (when theirs would have
dropped had they used themselves as a timer).  Like I said, I NEVER had
anyone that didn't have cleric buffs up during a fight unless I was low
mana, and then I would let them know that I knew.
