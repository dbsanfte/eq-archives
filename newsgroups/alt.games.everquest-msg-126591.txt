- Sun Revenants in Scarlet Desert are pretty good xp and undead.
- Coterie of various locations are undead
- The Shissar in the Grey are undead along with the Undying Iksars
- The Xi Xaui and their ilk in Maidens Eye are undead (I was thrilled to
discover yesterday)

These are all good undead to hunt on the moon.  Bring your ghoulbane unless
you have some other kind of uber weaponry.  Use that in conjunction with
your Instrument of Nife spell and you'll do an extra 1000 to 2000 points of
damage per fight depending on your dex.
