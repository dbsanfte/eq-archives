Vox and Nagafen are a bit strange due to the level limit.  The larger guilds
don't take them down because they're over the limit.  The smaller ones don't
because they're too low.

This leads to most raids on them being pickup.

I remember going on several Vox raids before I got too high.  They were ALL
pickup raids.  I'd be minding my own business, and get a tell: "Vox raid! 
Wanna come?"  The hazards of being a non-anonymous enchanter...

The interesting thing is that was time went on, they got more and more
successful.  The raid leaders were learning, and they were also learning the
names of people that would be assets on the next attempt.  If you were an
idiot, you didn't get asked back.

My last few raids were all successful.  I even managed to stay alive through
most of them.  The leader was a bard trying for the white scale.  He'd held
off leveling for months, and would lead a raid every weekend (or so it
seemed).

Over time, he got really good at leading Vox raids, and knew what classes
and how many to get.  He also got a list of people that wouldn't screw it
up.

Oh yes.  I think we had 3 minimum.
