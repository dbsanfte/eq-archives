Yeah.  Does anyone else find this kind of weird?

In EQ1, it sucked initially, because I started during a Qeynos Hills undead
invasion (what genius came up with putting level 5-10 aggro mobs right where
level 1 newbies respawn?).  But once I got past that, there was a feeling of
being in the world.  I could have run to West Karana and on, or through
Blackburrow and Everfrost.  I didn't have to go do the usual newbie quests
and stuff.

Same in DAoC.  I think I started in Cotswald, and before doing any quests,
just ran around, found Prydwyn Keep, and Camelot, and maybe even found the
border keep in Sauvage, and say the impressive array of NPC wizards and
archers there to make sure the PvP stuff stayed in the frontier.  There I
am, in a big world right from the start.

I've kind of come to expect that in an MMORPG: be dumped into a world,
perhaps with some help dialogs or an initial quest or two in my quest
journal, and with a weapon equipped or in inventory and a spell or two if
I'm a caster.  So, this "get off the island" thing in EQ2 seems rather odd
to me.
