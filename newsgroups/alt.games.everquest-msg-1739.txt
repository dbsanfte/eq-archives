Reminds me of when I was stationed in Korea. We had a regular group, and our
bard
Cerikk (rathe) regularly had three songs during all combats. If i remember
correctly it was
a song that made us faster and lowered their defense, a song for my satamina
{weak sta as a human
warrior} and a healing song. Only on great connection days, was he able to
do four and then
only for a couple of seconds at best. Sure do miss grouping with that man.
