Well, you've done all you can.  You're just going to run into streaks like
that.  I've seen people go as many as 200 combines without a skill-up.  I
myself have been pretty lucky and not run into any such bad streaks getting
skill-ups, but once I did fail a trivial combine (y'know, 5% chance of
failure) three times in a row.  Since that trivial combine was turning blue
diamonds into blue diamond powder, that was an especially expensive run of
bad luck.

Just keep at it; you'll get a skill-up eventually.
