All open to you
-----
Qinimi
Ferubi
Barindu
Riwwi
Sewer Trials 1-4
Vxed/Tipt
LDoN Hard
BoT
HoH
Tactics(alt quest group doable and iirc keys entire group)

---

Leaving out the stuff that gives you shit xp with crap loot like
Torment or CoD.

For Challenge:

Kod Taz(can be done with the single group trials Sewer/Vxed/Tipt)
Yxxta(same thing as Kod Taz... when Kod Taz opens this does too)
Ikkinz 1(group trial... open to your group if you get KT access)

Closed to you
-----
VP
Sol Ro
Elemental Planes

Of those 3 areas closed to you.. the only one i would cry a river over
is the elementals. Sol Ro is a loot zone, people go there to get
ornate to resell, the xp isn't that great. Earth xp is still some of
the best sustainable xp in the game, and I don't mind seeing people
earn it rather than just letting everybody's insta-65 in ala BoT.
Personally, that isn't you and I wouldn't mind seeing you there.. but
put in the leg work on it if you want it. Also, in that list of open
to you.. a lot of the zones like vxed or the sewer trials or tipt have
very nice upgrades for your character. Look up Bracer of the
Heartstriker some time. The gear is out there for you and your group
if you're willing to go after it in the zones you can get into, and
not worry about the ones you can't.
