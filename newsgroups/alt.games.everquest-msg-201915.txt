I agree that more is ALWAYS better, but I am just saying that if you have 
your stats at or over 200 you won't get much return on the last 50 points. 
(at least not as much as you got on the first 50)

I would think that by the time someone was attempting / could afford to 
attempt the high end stuff they would have their core stats capped.

I guess it depends on the cost to get your stat(s) to 255 and how far along 
you are on your trade skill. I got to about 150 Jeweling with about 150 
INT. I'm now up to 198 Jeweling and I've got my (buffed) Int up to 254. My 
statincreases cost me quite a bit (but I was doing them anyway for more 
mana etc.) So now I'm all set-up for the big push through platinum, once I 
get level 34 :-)
