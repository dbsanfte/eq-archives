I've decided to try a pure warrior, for those times when managing the
complexities of my 58 Shadowknight become too much and even worrying
about backstab would be a burden. <grinz>

Have Iksar become viable mid-level and end-game warriors?

I heard that their AC was pitiful, but have been seeing new pieces
dropping in Hate and elsewhere lately that leads me to think that
while they may not be 100% maximized like an Ogre, they are at least
95%+ (compared to a 70%+ for an SK, guessing) in their role?

Be serious now ^_^
Would you rather group with the 35th Barb or the 35th Iksar doing
pick-up groups at the zone?
