I have to say the turnaround over the last two days has been staggering. We
are shipping the seriously injured Balinese out here now and two Red Cross
funds are been set up - one for the Australians and one for the Balinese.

The government got pressured into acting - just a pity it had to be
pressured to "do the right thing:

It's odd - whilst I still hold my healthy contempt for governments of all
creed but I feel an odd feeling. I think it might actually be pride in
fellow Australians for applying the pressure... though I am not sure as it
definatelyis a new feeling to me.

Then again - it could be just wind... *burps*

Anyway - It has definately made me a happier chappy.
