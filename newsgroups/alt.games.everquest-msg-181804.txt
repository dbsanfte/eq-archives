	Aye, true.  Doing a morph on the model wouldn't even require
	retexture or a new model.  Ditto dynamic tinting (hey, they are
	about to do dynamic tinting to all armor so tinting the landmarks
	couldn't add much more overhead).

	But unless and until they do something my argument still stands:
	I'll use maps whenever the landscape is so repetitive as to not be
	uniquely identifiable as any form of "landmark".
