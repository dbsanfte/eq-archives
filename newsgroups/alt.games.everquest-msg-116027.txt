Hi Rodjk,

I stopped playing for about two years, came back in january 2002 and created
new characters.
Recently, I remembered my old level 11 Barbarian warrior on the Solusek Ro,
logged on it and it was still here !!!

If they didn't delete this one after almost 2 years, I guess they never
delete anyone.
Characters must not need a lot of room in their database anyway.
