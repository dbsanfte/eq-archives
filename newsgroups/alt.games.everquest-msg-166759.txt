A rather more correct characterization would be that Richard's
guild is one of many that demonstrate your "rule" to be a false
generalization made from incomplete data.  The majority of the
guilds I am familiar with are "family-style" and/or "chaotic
association of fellow travellers".  Feudal-style guilds are not
uncommon, but neither are they prevalent in my experience on
several servers over several years.  And let's not forget the
occasional pirate-style guild, like the pathetic jerks that
slapfish described in the "A Guild that Preys on Noobs" thread.
