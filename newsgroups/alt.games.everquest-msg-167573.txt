Exp takes more and more time and effort as you get higher and higher.  They
did away with hell levels but rounded out how much exp everything takes
instead, so its more gradual.  To make up for this a little you will be
getting more exp for tougher critters, but its noticably slower the higher
level you get.  Due to this, you will have to pick one or two chars (because
you can dual box) who you want to level beyond 55 +, and stick with it.
expect to level with this char about every 2 to 4 weeks.  In about 6 months
you'll be 60th.
You need to learn to do things like using /LFG on, do /who lfg all 51 55 or
/who all 51 55 to find people around your level and what zone they are in.
You should research good zones for your level and if you cannot find a group
to start one up yourself.  Doing these actions will help get a group, but
won't guarantee it.
Beyond leveling, you should be researching better equipment for these 1 or 2
characters, so you should be looking into where is good places to get plat /
items they need and where they are.
The power level between a group of 60th's and a group of 52nd is very
noticable.  Due to this if you can get one of your chars in a group of 5
60th leveled people who don't need you being 60th, your experience will fly.
Going anon would be a good idea to help facilitate this, although don't
directly lie and say your higher level than you are if asked.  Without a
good reputation your grouping ability could suffer.
To help quicken your research, some good places to hunt before PoP was The
Hole, Velks, Kael or Thurg, Seb, and Cazic Thule.  Instead of roaming around
with 1 or 2 chars it would be beneficial to post a char at each of these
places since you have so many 50 + chars, and use them as spokespeople for
the 1 or 2 chars you want to level to 60th.
