There's a few:
The bazaar
Addition of chat channels and later /raid channels if they are ever
fixed and given to everyone. (They are currently bullshit. Raid, that
is, not chat.)
Focus items to balance casters
Player made armor upgrades for the tradeskillers

> Also, what "improvement" to the game do you most dislike?

The manaburn nerf
The current bullshit situation of raid channels
The continual "retuning" of zones to prevent quadding anywhere if
possible.
