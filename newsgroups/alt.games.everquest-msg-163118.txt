Little things like this make a huge difference in your flow of exp. At 
least for me the levels around where you are now (in the 40s) where 
people start realizing this and start to be a little more efficient.. By 
the time you get into your 50s people have learned to chit chat and 
fight at the same time :) ..

I recently leveled a wizzie a little (I think he's 39 or 40 now), 
sometimes soloing, sometimes grouping depending on what I felt like. The 
difference between playing with a group of "newbies" that don't really 
know how to be efficient and a group with other twinks who have grinded 
through the 50s (or solo) is huge. Sure when grouping (solo on a caster 
gear doesn't matter that much) twinked out melees will kill faster, but 
discipline within the group is a very big factor.

Since you play a monk I suspect you do the pulling a lot of the time, 
seems you should be able to affect the pace in a group. Don't stand 
around chit chatting, go out and pull more instead :) .. Keep an eye on 
your casters mana though ..
