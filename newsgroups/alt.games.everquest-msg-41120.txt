Me too :) We've got a couple of restaurants around here 
that make drop-dead fantastic food.  And neither of em 
use whatever that additive is that nobody wants to eat 
:) which is pretty impressive, since the flavor is still 
there.  One of em is just the usual "6 trays" bit for 
buffet, but the other one has two huge islands full of 
food, and a dessert bar as well.  It's heaven :)

*sigh* Actually, no.  The Vancouver airport is a mess 
because of all the diverted planes, there's one japanese 
jet and one other... I forget which ... jet that have 
apparently been diverted here and there's a TON of 
secrecy around the japanese one, dunno why... the 
ferries between the island and the mainland are only 
accepting foot passengers last I heard... and hopefully 
within the next few days there'll be blood clinics set 
up to donate.  I hope.
