Yes -- that is a problem with the Mouseware stuff.  If you
play other games (like Unreal Tournament), you'll notice that
the scroll wheel no long works there either.

I'm just using the built-in Winbloze XP mouse drivers and
everything works fine.  My guess is that the Mouseware drivers
re-map the wheel to some non-standard codes that the games
do not know about.  Why Logitech did this, I don't know.  I
love every piece of Logitech hardware I have, and they're
the only brand mouse I'll ever buy, but I can live without
their mouse drivers.
