I'll just give a link to my site, rather than post something that might look
like an ad for the hosting company I use, and if you care to deduce who they
are (e.g., by using whois or dig to see who provides my DNS), so be it:

    http://www.tzs.net/.

I picked them for two reasons.  One, a friend has used them a while and is
happy, and two, searching the net.abuse groups for them turns up just a
couple of spam complaints, quickly dealt with.
