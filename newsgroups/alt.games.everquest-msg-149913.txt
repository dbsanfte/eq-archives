Okay, so I have been in raids on Befallen and Crushbone and one brief
encounter with Naggy (yeah, I know, newb stuff, but they were each
really fun none the less), but none of my char's. are high enough of
level to participate in the uber loot raids. That said, I am curious
about the actual act of looting in those situations:

1. If the looting rights are not predetermined (as I understand they
darn well should be on the uber stuff) how do you keep the corpse from
poofing while this is decided? How long will the corpse stay put?

2. How do you ensure that no one else runs in and ninjas the loot
while it is all being sorted out? Does someone open up a loot window?
Just how long can you keep it open? What about LD?

3. If no one in the group/party can really use a particular no-drop
item - due to class/race/diety restriction or such, is it just left to
rot? (and if so, how do I get on the tell list for rotting items?  :-P

4. On the uberest of mobs, does anyone even care about what group
actually gets the xp? How about the cash loot?

5. What is the suicide rate of raid loot distribution officers? How
about the death by duelling rate? Talk about high-stress
responsibility.

Tia.
