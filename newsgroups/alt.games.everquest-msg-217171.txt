Done.  Or, er, will be done when I get home.  I get to make Rincewind the
human wizard with reeeally low charisma, and my husband is going to make
Twoflower, a halfing...druid?  What class would suit Twoflower best? We
agreed that halfling was the right race.

Now we just need to convince our guildies to make Cohen, Conina, and that
dumb kid...whatever his name was.
