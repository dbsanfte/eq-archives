(Note the destinction between FAVORITE and BEST.)

Just curious, have too much some on my hands, so...

What's your favorite race (overall):


Favorite Race group (as in Wood Elf/High Elf/Half Elf,
Barbarian/Human/Erudite, etc.):


Favorite Race/Class combo:


My answers:

1) High Elves. They're my favorite caster race, despite having on-par
intelligence, compared to the other caster races. For several reasons.

A) The difference between intelligence between Gnomes/DEs and HEs is
trivial. Six less mana is not going to adversely effect your mana pool.
Basically when it comes to intelligence, there's Erudites, then Dark
Elves/High Elves/Gnomes and then Humans (and Iksars if you're talking about
necros.)

B) I, for one LIKE the Greater Faydark. It's nice and big, and has a good
place for 5-7's, (Orc Hill) and CB is just around the corner. It's also very
easy to get to Ak'Anon or Kaladim from Gfay.

C) PARTIALLY balanced stats--they have fairly nice dexterity and agility,
and the best Charisma of all caster races. Only their strength and stamina
are low.

D) I _hate_ Erudites. They have the worst newbie zone in the game, no night
vision, and the only thing going for them is high INT. Their other stats are
crap.

2) Elves. Could you guess? If you pool all elves together, they can do
almost anything. High Elves make good casters and clerics, Wood Elves are
nice Druids, Rangers, Bards, and Rogues, and half elves can do well in a lot
of areas. I also don't like the look of the short races...and the "human"
races' night vision is a SEVERE limitation.

3) High Elf caster. Could you guess that I like elves?
