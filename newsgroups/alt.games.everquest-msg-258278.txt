Before I say anything...exactly who are you addressing?  Initially you
addressed me, but Bizbee then thought you were arguing *him* and shot
back, so you are very likely responding to half Foxeye argumetn and half
bizbee argument, and I'm inclined to think that combining Foxeye and
Bizbee isn't wise. Not to mention it's downright unsettling.

Just for the record, no, I wouldn't do that.  But the truth is that I
shouldn't *have* to look out for them. Not saying I won't, but that I
shouldn't have to. And it pisses me off that people in traffic behave as
if I should.

He also switched sides. First he was arguing me, then when you argued with
me, he argued with you.  Usenet has just gotten too confusing for me
today.
