Being totally new to EQ, I have a question. I'm playing a Human Paladin 
and am level 5. Thus far, I've put all my training points into 1H 
Slashing. In the first 10 or so levels, does that make sense? Most of 
the other skills I can use at this point don't seem like they'd help me 
much and getting my weapon skill as high as possible with each level 
seems the best way to go for now. Is this a correct assumption on my 
part? I'm not looking for the uber paladin template, I'm just curious if 
there is some essential skill I should be splitting my training points 
between or if focusing on my weapon skill exclusively for now is the way 
to go.

Thanks
nib
