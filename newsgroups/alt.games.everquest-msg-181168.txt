Well, I think every case is different.  In my opinion for a 10 plat
item undercutting to 9 plat (1 plat difference) is okay.  For
13000p I would do a 500 plat discount, or at least 250.  For a
50 plat item at least a 5 plat discount should be used. To me
there really is no difference between 12999 and 13000.  This
is not a bargain, a deal, or an enticement.  Maybe I feel more
strongly about this because I actually do a lot of trading and
people who do stuff like this are just annoying.  So in
retaliation I will only buy from a lower trader if I feel he's made
the effort to discount his wares.
