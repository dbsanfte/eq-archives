I'm having a hard time understanding this, in that, well, if haste
stacks, and you cast one 10% and get another 15% from your gloves,
okay, you're now 25% hasted.  But if you cast fear, and then proc fear
- what, the thing is now 25% more frightened?  Or is it saying "necro
fear lasts 1 minute, and then we'll add the proc in, which lasts
another minute"?

I'd still never use it.  I'd rather have 15-20 int between both hands
and no weapon than that silly thing.  My pet and dots are for hitting,
I'm for FDing or gating ;p
