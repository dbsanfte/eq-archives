In the top area, there is a place with a mansion and a high level named guy.
The guards around and in that mansion are on a different faction from the
other Katta guards.  In fact, if I recall correctly, killing them raises
your faction with the regular Katta guards.  (It doesn't do anything for
merchants, though, so even though my Dark Elf Wizard did 54-58 there, he
still could not sell to anyone).
