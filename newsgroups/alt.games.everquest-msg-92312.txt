Depends.  As a level 35 Paladin, I love seeing a caster mob.  BABS goes into
the backpack, and out comes my Ghoulbane and Watcher.  "Castermob begins to
cast a spell"  BASH "Castermob is interrupted."  "Castermob begins to cast a
spell"  CEASE "Castermob is stunned."  I rarely have to hit desist before
bash has refreshed.  I've noticed that, for the little mana Cease costs,
using that in conjunction with Bash has a very large effect on how rough the
fight is for my group.

Looking forward to that.  I'll start leveling again once I get the melatite
for my armor.

Good to know.  I'll have to give those a try.  I'll just be sure to have SoW
first.  Root him to get a head start, and run for LoIO.

That's a Seb drop, IIRC.  Is 45 really a reasonable level for that?

Ah, buff healing.  Didn't learn about that until late in the game.

Pitty.  Alot of time, I'm just not able to hit a group.  I'd like to be able
to solo for those times.

Fear kiting cats.

And alot of bandages and bind wound.

Considering they need the mob's back to them to shine...

Don't forget about Bards.  One of my roommates plays one, and I've seen him
soloing whites and yellows.  Maybe not as stellar as a wizard or druid, but
impressive to my pally, none the less.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
