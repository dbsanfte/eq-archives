In this case someone was probably referring to the {fix,nerf} on group 
buffs that's probably going to be made live soon.  The way it's supposed to 
work is that spells over lvl 50 aren't supposed to be cast on players under 
a certain level (43? 46?).  The way it is now, a high level character can 
invite a bunch of level 1 players into their group, target themselves and 
cast a group buff and all of the players in that group will receive the 
buff.  When you think about it, a level 1 character can be running around 
with 1300+ hit points (about 40x the normal), 500 mana pool (about 5x the 
size of a lvl 1 with 255 WIS) regen'ing 14 mana per tick, or faster than 
they can actually cast their spells.  SOE intends to fix this, disallowing 
characters under those levels from receiving the overpowering buffs.
