Had an interesting one yesterday. Whilst playing a low level gnome wiz (6)
up shows this lvl 2 human in the steamfonts looking for coyote skulls and
willing to pay. Sold him a couple for 5PP each; easy money as there is an
abundant supply of coyotes just east of the portal book.

But then, one has to wonder what a lvl 2 human was doing here with loads of
cash...

Later,
