  The overall best resource for history that I've been able to find so far is on
here: http://pub33.ezboard.com/f1stfistoflightfrm47

  No, the Combine was a multiracial culture, lead primarily by humans.  The
snakemen on the moon are the Shissar, and yes, they are the ones who had the
Iksar enslaved.  They were the ones who created the spires (if you look at the
glyph on the side of the spires, it rather resembles a coiled cobra, complete
with hood and tongue) and helped the children of Rallos Zek invade the Planes of
Power... of that the children of Rallos (ogres, giants, ect.) were scattered and
cursed.  The Shissar were similarly cursed, and like the giants, regressed in to
lesser beings (the Lizardmen you see in and about the Temple of Cazic-Thule)
except those who managed to escape to Luclin.

  The Combine Empire made extensive use of the spires that were left behind by
the Shissar and were the first to unlock their secrets.  The Combine Empire
eventually split, leading to its ruin.  The gypsies are the remnants of the
Combine Empire on Norrath, while others escaped to the moon to rebuild there.

  The Kerrans weren't poisoned, the leader of the Combine Empire, named "Katta"
was poisoned.  As for the reason they met in the first place, I think it was
Katta's attempt to reunite the Empire that seemed to be falling apart at the
seams.  Also, I don't think it's mentioned (at least not in the Lore I can
remember) that the person who poisoned Katta was Teir'Dal.  I think it's
somewhat implied that one of the 'inquisitors' within the Combine empire did it
to attempt to prove that evil was threatening the Combine to strengthen their
case against letting in the other dark races.

  I don't know if the Kerrans were part of the Combine Empire... it's possible
the Combine Empire overlooked them, or that the Kerrans weren't interested.  Or
they could have been a part of it, but if they were, they were probably some of
the more quiet, non-controversial members.

  Later, of course, the Kerrans were blasted off of Odus during the war between
the 'good' erudites and the heretics, depositing them on Luclin.
