First of all, as long as there's a guide on at the time the character
is created, the guide gets a pop-up to approve or deny each name at
the time of character creation. (They can only do one at a time,
though. Any creation attempts while one is waiting to be approved or
denied only go through the auto-filter)

Penalties for name violations are usually just a name change.
However... Extreme violations ( Sexually explicit names, names
containing obscene language, names referring to hate groups, etc ) can
net the offender a warning or even an outright banning. For example,
for the months after 9-11, anyone caught with a name referrencing Bin
Laden or the Taliban, etc would find themselves banned. I'm not
certain if that degree of punishment is still in effect, though.

Rule of thumb: If you know the name is against the rules, don't be an
ass and try to slip it through the filters. Personally, I think they
should start handing out suspensions and bannings to everyone who
frequently slips obviously bad names through.
