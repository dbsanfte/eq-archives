/agree

I played it for a couple of months and it does many things very well. I
really liked the game, as far as that goes. However, it is very short on
content and the bugs were a bit hard to live with to this point. It also
bothered me that once you got to level 20 in a construction skill, you
pretty much made the same one or two things over and over and over until
you got to the next "tier" in your level progression when you made the
same things, just with higher quality components that were harder to
find. 

It really is a beautiful game though. I wouldn't be a bit surprised if I
check it out again in another six months or so. Then again, by then
there will be EQ2, WoW and still EQ. :P
