(1) There are quite a few newbie quests for frogs -- both class quests and
citizenship quests. You should do them all if you possible. The Improved
Damage II belt you get at the end is pretty nice. Most of the newbie armor
bits are pretty decent, and almost all of the pieces needed for the quests
are droppable and can be found on merchants in the area if you want.

(2) The frog newbie area is *great* if you're into self-twinking. My frogwiz
xp'd off spiderlings and zombies until they greened out at L5 or L6, and
saved every silk and skin. I had around 600pp by then from selling them
in the bazaar. I'll be the first to admit that I think this kind of behavior
violates the "Sony EQ Vision(tm)" and trivializes most of the content for
those under level 20, but I thought I'd try it out for once, and I realize
that others may well disagree with my opinion on the topic.

(3) On the other hand, once you hit level 6 and actually have to leave the
area right next to the guards, Innothule *sucks* as a newbie zone until
you're about level 10-12. The high aggro radius of the burly kobolds and
troll raiders, combined with the very poor visibility in zone pretty much
guarantees that you will be doing corpse runs on the average of every 15-20
minutes, unless you're in a full group.
