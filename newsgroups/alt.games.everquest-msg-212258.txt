There are lots of dark blues in the buildings in Torgirans, and, for that 
matter, I believe deep in the mines as well.  Droga is almost all dark 
blue, I usually work my way in from the Nurga zone line, crawled as far 
as the jail cell area, where there are higher level mobs.  The problem 
there was the crowding, so it was not a very viable spot.  Damned shaman 
was casting Malo and Pox there.

The golems spawn in that whole area after you go through the castle, 
across the ramp/bridge, and out the other castle.  I choose a nice quite 
spot that has no roamers, and root and rot there.
