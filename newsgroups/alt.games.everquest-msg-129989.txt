LOL... isn't that little like "the pot calling the kettle black"...
Your bitching about my bitching.. rofl

FYI... you better check the damage again on your DS, 
It don't out damage a 45 warrior.. does 25 tops.
I got a 55 mage and never seen it do better then that!!

I was bitching about wizards getting crits mainly to the KS potential,
I have had a few AC's KS'd from me in Sro and the ONLY ones that
managed that were wizards. Hell they are the only ones capable of
KS'ing a mage with pet on a mob.
Well with the exception of a chanter and that accursed KS spell mem
blur.

Yeah... druids, necros and shaman have some really POWERFUL dots, but
they don't do enough damage fast enough before mage's nukes and pet
can finish off mob.

Imagine a wiz coming by casts a few ice comets  ( or any other HIGH
OCTANE DD)and add to that he might get a crit or two and whammo...
effective KS!!
