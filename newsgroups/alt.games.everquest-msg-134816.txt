While that is true, if a group member gates away from a battle
where your body has already hit the floor and the only real
choice for him was whether to join you in heading for the
bind spot naked or fully dressed...

Still situationally dependant, if there's a cleric successfully
camped out at the spot where you died, its better to die
than to gate.

Your "a bit tough, where he/she might get hit" situation would
certainly not be one a cleric should be gating out of.  Clerics
have 18 seconds of "you can't  hit me, and really if there's
anyone else here you don't like still alive, you hate them
more than me" available from level one, and a second
available from level 29, plus AC and HP rivaling that of
plate wearing melee classes.  For them to even consider gating
out -both- DA spells should be blown and the situation
should be overwhelmingly bad, chanter dead, most
tanks dead, evac dead... so bad that any other class
is already busy trying to figure out where to buy a coffin.
