If, by which is best, you mean which will give you the most points in the
applicable stats for a Magician, then it's Erudite.  The one drawback, which
is not as bad as it used to be, is that they are nightblind, but they do get
spells to compensate for that, not sure at what level.  If you mean, which
is the most fun to play, that is highly subjective, and you will have to
choose that on your own.  A good place to look for information would be
http://eq.castersrealm.com.  Good luck with whatever race you choose, and
above all, have fun.
