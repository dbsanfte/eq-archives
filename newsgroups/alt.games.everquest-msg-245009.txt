Hi all,

AA Description below..... my question however is how much does this AA help
the spell trigger off as this spell on my MT at the moment is next to
useless.  Haven't seen it fire once.

Do you see a drastic improvement when these AA's are purchased?


Info from: http://membres.lycos.fr/niphreedil/aa.htm

AA:  Unfailing Divinity
Type: Passive
Requirement: PoP, level 61
Ranks: 3   Points per rank: 2/4/6
Usefulness: Average
Abbreviation: UD

This ability increases the likelihood of a Death Pact or Divine Intervention
spell to successfully heal their target.
As we understand these spells today (October 2003), if a character buffed
with Death Pact or Divine Intervention takes damage and his hitpoints drop
below 15% of his maximum, there is a chance that he will get healed, and the
spell then fades (oversimplified view of the spell mechanics, but what
matters is the trigger concept).  Death Pact heals for 300 HP, Divine
Intervention completely heals the character.
The probability that the spell fires off is based on the character's
charisma, the higher the charisma, the better the probability.  Unfailing
Divinity increases this probability, additional ranks giving an even better
chance of success.  Also, with Divine Intervention it gives a chance to get
a small heal even if the spell fails, the amount healed being of the order
of 1500 HP per rank.
Rank 1 can be trained at 61 or later.
Rank 2 can be trained at 63 or later.
Rank 3 can be trained at 65.
