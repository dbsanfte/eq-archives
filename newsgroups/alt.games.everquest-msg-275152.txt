I played AC2 for all of two hours. I found the character models for the few 
races available to be rather silly, and I didn't like the interface at all. 
That was all a matter of personal preference, of course.

However, the performance was absolutely horrendous at the time. Lag spikes 
would render the game as a slide show quite often in the newbie area I was 
in when there were just a few other players around.

Not knowing anything more than that about AC2, I will say that EQ2 blows me 
away by comparison.

Fwiw.
