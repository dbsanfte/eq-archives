Complete nonsense.  Of course there was risk.  There was a risk when
we invaded Afganistan, or pushed Iraq out of Kuwait, fought in WWII as
well as WWI, Vietnam, pretty much any war since the creation of
chemical warfare.  It wasn't until nuclear proliferation that the
world changed forever.

With the *possible* exception of Israel, (they have never admitted
possessing nuclear weapons) countries do not threaten the sovereignty
of nations that possess nuclear weapons.

If we were to invade North Korea it will use its nuclear arsenal to
defend its sovereignty, most definitely.  And that creates a massive
mess, beyond the death of thousands of US troops...

I wasn't referring to attacks on civilians.

Not on the battlefield, which is where Kim Chong-il would use them. 
This is perhaps the only reason that we never had a conventional war
with the USSR.  This is why we resorted to arming the enemies of our
enemies and using diplomatic alternatives against nuclear-capable
nations.
