Except the problem is..
They have X man-hours to use. After launch balance issues will emerge.
The focus will be on nerfs and any unfinished classes , abilities, quest
will have to wait.
Been there. Done that.

If you were looking as an artisan trader as the sole reason to buy the game
you would be disappointed.
A heads up by beta testers or realistic posting by publisher saying the
artisan class will not be ready at launch prevents that.
