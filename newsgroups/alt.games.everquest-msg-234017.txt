Only 41 with my druid and ensare (non-AoE) is perfect for quadding
(with the somewhat puny AoE DD from level 34 :( ).  No risk of pulling
in mobs you don't want, cheap to cast, long lasting, reliabea and
rarely resisted.

As for it lasting longer than you ever need, it doesn't.  Pulling 7-8
Zels in DSP this morning it wore off before I killed the last one. Yes
I know you only hit 4 at a time with AoE DD but I like to keep going
till nearly OOM and then go away and med for 10 minutes doing
something else (with the sound up load so I hear if anything attacks
me) ... roll on 45 and KEI.

Only one thing to watch is that you don't accidentally ensnare
yourself or you are in serious trouble!
