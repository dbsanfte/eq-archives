Assuming you're the druid half, I choose B.  I recently went at level 47
just to wander around and maybe do a little farming (I am always THRILLED
when an appropriate level group is around, I love SolB and I wish more 20s
would go...any time someone does a camp check I check their level...if
they're high level I respond.  If they're an appropriate level I say
nothing...if they come to where I am I gleefully turn the camp over to
them).  There's about 4 spawns around the high gob sham.  I believe all
solusek gobs see through invis and you may have to deal with one or two
right around there.  I'd recommend having GATE, root, snare, dot, damage
shield, and fury of air memmed.   Root for crowd control.

Actually getting to the room may be a little hairy, but if you're invis and
you just run like hell you should be able to get past most casters before
they notice you.  If not, and if you know SolA, just take 'em down some
place relatively safe and move on.

The high gob sham room only has 2 spawns so is real piece of cake.  Once you
get there you MIGHT be able to aggro just one at a time.  If not, it still
shouldn't be a big problem unless one of them are a solusek wizard (never
remember seeing one...but an inferno wizard is annoying enough).

Pre-raid buffs:  resist fire, endure magic, SLD, damage coat should do it.
Oh, and SoW of course.
