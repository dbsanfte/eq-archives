It doesn't invalidate your argument. It just shows that it's misplaced. 
You seem to have manufactured a topic to argue here. No one said that the 
tag "makes up the guild", yet you continue to drive the point home that 
it doesn't. Would it help if I agreed with you on that point? I do. It 
was merely posed and supported that the wearing of a guild tag often 
demonstrates guild pride.

I would much rather be able to easily weed out the knuckleheads as 
automatic tag display would permit.

You implied that the motive was a desire for personal satisfaction as 
opposed to what's good for the guild. If that's not what you meant, fine, 
but that's the way it came off.
