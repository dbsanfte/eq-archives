Look at it this way to make your decision.

Say unslowed mob does 100 DPS.

At 50% slow, he would do 50 DPS.

At 65% slow, he would do 35 DPS.

At 70% slow, he would do 30 DPS.

Over the long haul, Forlorn will reduce the damage done by 1/7th compared 
to Shiftless.  Even though the slow is only 5% more, it actually reduces 
the damage the mob inflicts from melee by over 14% for the cost of 25 
additional mana.  For most xp grouping, nobody is likely to really notice 
the difference, but, over time it does add up.
