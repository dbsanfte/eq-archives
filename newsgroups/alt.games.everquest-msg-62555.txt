one other thing i noticed your level 7.there may be a well establised board
for Terris thule already. i mean no offence by this. but i know on my server
they sorta keep the message board hush-hush. mainly to keep lowbies out from
selling crap in the auction section and asking "basic" questions. i had my
2nd character above 40 before i found out about it. there usually is a place
that most high level guilds schedual raid rotations. assuming the whole
server isnt FFA.
