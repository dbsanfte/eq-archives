Why not use your pet?  Sure, it has terrible HP, but I"m not suggesting
it as sponge... it will hit just as hard as his pet if you hand it a rusty

halberd.  Won't cost you any exp, hardly any mana... SK pet doesn't
become a silly proposition until up around 30 or so, when 20 damage
just doesn't cut it any more.  Even then, if you hand it some of the
trash drops out of the FM giant fort you'll see damage in the 40 point
range, again not negligible.
