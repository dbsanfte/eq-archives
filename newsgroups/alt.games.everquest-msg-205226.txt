This would be trivial to test. Simply give the pet 2 different weapons
like a piercer and a slasher. Then watch its damage outputs. If it displays
both types of hits then its dual wielding.

All necro and mage pets dual even if you don't give them weapons
at level 39. No idea whether that is true for other pets or not.

I always try to give my pets weapons ever since that time they
implemented Project Monster on the test server where you could
play a monster and attack players. I noticed that when I equipped
a weapon as a monster my attack value went up a lot. I think the
pets may be the same in that their weapon skills are higher than
their hand-to-hand skill.

I loved that Project Monster it was a blast to play as a mob.
