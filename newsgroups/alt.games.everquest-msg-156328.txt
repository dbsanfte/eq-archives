I only have a 30 paladin, so the answer is zero, but the problem is that I
started the character because of an ability that was removed. I feel like
the time i spent levelling were wasted, and am now at a loss as to what
character to focus on. What if i start a necro, who most people say are too
powerful, especially solo, and they decide to remove the necro pet and
refund any aa points people might have spent on getting a better pet?

And i know some people might be able to gain 30 levels in a wet afternoon
but apart from the ghoulbane and a nice shield, my gear's not much better
than plate or is plate.

The fact is, paladins, from my 30 levels perspective, don't seem that
terrific, as clerics seem to have moved in on their turf, but they had this
one really cool power; which was removed.

I guess warrior is the safest choice for a new character but I like being
able to be a little independent. What's the best class for warrior, should I
go for an ogre? I suppose a dwarf at least lets me recycle the gear.
