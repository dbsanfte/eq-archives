See "12. You will not exploit any bug..." in
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/support/customer_service/cs_rules_of_conduct.jsp
Now tell me, where does it say squat about being warned?

The post-50 group buff bug was either difficult to fix, or just
another example of "if it can't be exploited to defeat or bypass
high-end content it just isn't important enough to bother".  And
they obviously decided it was pointless to try to enforce their
anti-exploit policy for it (can you imagine...).  But, given that
they put in code specificly to prevent these high level buffs
from being cast on low levels, it's pretty obvious that this is
one of those "bugs that grant the user unnatural or unintended
benefits in game".

And as for Mr. NerfWhiner, if it's a bug fix it ain't a nerf.
