<snip fascinating, but confusing, theoretical discussion>

Although I was aware of the general consensus around things like the Paludal
bonus (and have experienced it directly), I wasn't aware of anything like an
overall ZEM. Is the link referenced in this thread the only source of
information on this topic or is there other research elsewhere? I would be
interested in seeing a list somewhere that puts all of this into
comprehensible, simple terms. I'm only a lowly level 33, and I do thoroughly
enjoy the discovery of new locales and experiences and will continue to
explore for many more levels to come. I will never forgo the opportunity to
smell the roses and enjoy the journey. But for those (fortunately few)
occasions when all I really want to do is just gain xp so that I can hit my
next spell level, Alchemy level, etc., it sure would be nice to know where
the best bang for buck can be had.

Bob
