I won't disagree about the way it was marketed for the leveling aspect
but my understanding was the leveling aspect was to be extremely
quick. Under the initial formulas for leveling it was extremely quick
and powerleveling was easy. Apparently Mythic didn't have faith in the
RvR portion or needed more time so they kept initiating more and more
exp gain slow downs.

Hehe lets not go there. You say it can't be done i say it can given
enough tries and if devs learn from their mistakes. The RvR portion of
DAoC ISS as i said many times before nothing more then Capture the
Flag. Unfortunately they  kept adding stuff that restricted that
aspect of it without making the keep taking aspect more important. If
the Rvr portion was truly accessible right out of the box instead of
"you have to be level 40+" to be useful then the game would be doing
even better now I suspect.
