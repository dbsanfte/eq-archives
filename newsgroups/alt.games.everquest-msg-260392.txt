The main problem with slow is that it is _so_ powerful that encounters have to
be designed around it, which are then impossible without it.

Imagine that some class had a group damage absorbtion spell that would
reduce any melee damage taken by anyone in your group by 75%, with no cap.
Would you call that unbalancing and a danger to the game?  It's exactly what
slow does.

It's also one of the spells that scales the wrong way as mobs get tougher.
Nukes reduce in power as mobs get more HP.  Atk or player HP buffs reduce in
power as the base players get stronger, making the buff less important as a
percentage.  Debuffs likewise if they remove a fixed number of points of
something.  Slow, however, increases in power to match the mob it's cast on.

Mitigation helps, and I hope SoE makes more use of it.  Unfortunately, it's
been the defining ability of Shamen for quite awhile, so if it's value is
reduced, you need to find another role for them.

Also note that other game-breaking abilities are those that scale with power
rather than being fixed-utility as power increases.  CH was reasonable when
a good tank had 2000 HP.  It's ludicrously efficient on modern characters.

Mez was fine when it just increased a group's efficiency because most
groups could take 2-3 adds and survive with some downtime.   Now it's
more along the lines of "it's required or useless, depending on the
encounter".  Charm also increases linearly with mob power, but the risk
increases as well so it may not belong on the list.
