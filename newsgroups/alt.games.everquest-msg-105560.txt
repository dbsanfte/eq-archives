If anything distorts the game and makes it uninteresting for most players,
it is a mid-level monk decked out in a fungi and high level weapons killing
everything in an area and sucking up all the experience available.  Nerfing
the fungi by making it level specific might be one of the single best
improvements VI could come up with from the point of view of the general
player base.  As for the twinked monks who claim the game will be unplayable
without it, let them remember that the manastone was nerfed a long time ago
and the game has done quite well without it.  If anything nerfing the fungi
will enhance the overall quality of game live by seriously limiting the
ability of a small handful of selfish and inconsiderate players to interfere
with normal game play.
