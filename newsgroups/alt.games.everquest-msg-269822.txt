The Steelwarriors had and likely still has a big thread on this subject.
The general answer is "It depends".  Primarily on where you are fighting.
The combat engine, loosely, looks at the difference between AC and mob ATK
to slant where the distribution of damage is, i.e., a totally overmatched
AC will generate nearly total minimum hits and conversely a totally
undermatched AC will generate mostly maximum hits.

However, there are some mobs with a really tight span from min-max
Ta'Grusch in Torment comes immediately to mind who hits for a min of like 1100
and a max of 1400.  HP is teh win there.
