My point was simply since this Fabled stuff started all of the sudden the
bazaar is stuffed with low priced haste belts of all type's, so is this
helping or hurting the game economic's, as for lack of high level gaming in
EQ, let me know when you find it, it's all rather second nature to me now
and getting more boring by the minute even on the plain of time.

After dropping over 500k in the casino I managed to score summon beer
gogles, a stats red gem, poison bolt gloves, a stack of wands for 5 charges
of make like a tree, a crap load of stat food crappy at best, various
potions of heal and illusion, and a gold ticket which precured a pre-nerf
visor for illusion dark elf, whoopy!

Yeah except all the noob's & alt's are collecting them.

  The Fabled Jboots being the one exception.  Instead of the

Run3 aa's is as good as the gimped sow, flight of eagles wastes it.

Yeah cause it's getting boring by the second, giving away Fabled drops is
not a good plan to fix that.

Stromm lol, they stole that suggestion from me, bad idea and bad server.
