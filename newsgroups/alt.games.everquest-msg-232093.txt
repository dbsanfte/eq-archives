Whoa!  Excuse me?  I set my prices based on how much money I *need*?
Doesn't it matter what I'm selling?  If all I need is bandages and
food, I should charge a few gold regardless of whether I'm selling
rat scales or leatherfoot haversacks?  (Of course, you could well ask
where a low-level gets a leatherfoot haversack, but my point is that
even a low-level can farm things whose utility varies widely.)  The
value -- to others -- of the items being sold has to have SOME bearing
on the prices being charged!

And I see no reason to expect that the value to a low-level and a
high-level should be equal.  Indeed, it's because they are NOT equal
that there is a valid economy at all.

The low-level spends some amount of time and effort to farm some stuff.
He places some value on that time and effort, based partly on how much
plat he could've made doing other things, and how much experience he
got compared to doing other things, etc.  Call his value X.

The high-level could spend some (different) time and effort farming the
stuff.  He places some value on the time and effort, again based to some
degree on what he could've gained (in money, XP, etc.) elsewhere.  Call
this value Y.

Finally, there is some limit to how much the high-level can spend for the
stuff, based on how much plat he has and how much other stuff he wants to
spend it on.  Call this limit Z.

Assuming X <= Y <= Z, then there is a market for this stuff.  Any price
between X and Y will make both the seller and buyer happy.  Putting the
price too close to X will make the seller less likely to bother getting
more of the stuff for future sales; too close to Y and the buyer may
decide to wait for prices to come down.  And of course there are multiple
sellers and buyers with different evaluations, which complicates things
a bit. :-)  But in a free market, the seller is free to try to maximise
his profits, regardless of his "needs", and the buyer gets to exercise
control over sellers by refusing to buy at certain prices.

Oh, and though I used low-level / high-level in the above, that was just
because the previous poster was talking in terms of relative "needs" of
low/high level toons.  Seller/buyer is really the important distinction.
In some cases the value to a high level is less than the cost for a low
level, in which case there's a market for the high level to sell stuff.
An obvious example is buffs, which are in some cases nearly free for a
high level (there is always a modest cost in the form of time spent
casting and medding), and thus they are often willing to give them free
or for a minimal donation.
