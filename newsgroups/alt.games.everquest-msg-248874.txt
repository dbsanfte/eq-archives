Yep, and my view is simply, that you can never have too much accuracy or
defense or damage, so even the paltry 7.5% is worth spending  a power
point on if it helps you defeat enemies more easily/safely.
The fact that it also boosts all your teammates is gravy.

I hadn't considered taking them due to the manual "suggesting" that they
only worked on teammates, but now that I know it's self as well, at
least one of those is going on my characters.
