I'm not positive of the stats or what level it would be good for, but
there's a female necro NPC that lives in the W. Freeport sewers off in a
little side tunnel. I wound up killing her once when she aggro'd on a
friend following me through the tunnel. She dropped some robe, don't
remember the stats, but the semi-newbie I gave it to at the bank seemed
pretty thrilled. Might want to look into that.

Q: How many surrealists does it take to screw in a light bulb? 
A: Two. One to hold the giraffe and the other to fill the bathtub with
brightly colored machine tools.
