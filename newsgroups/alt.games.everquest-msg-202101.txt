   It's not hunting so much as scavenging, but occasionally you'll find 
someone in Katta Castellum hunting the guards. Groups that are high 
enough to do this generally don't care about the loot the guards drop, 
so they'll usually let you pick the bodies clean to sell the stuff. You 
can get about 3 to 4 pp per armor piece and weapon. It adds up. 
   You can also use the loot to twink an alt a bit--I've got an Erudite 
shadowknight running around in a full suit of Validus Custodus plate 
mail. It appeals to his sense of irony. =)
