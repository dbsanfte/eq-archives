Uhm....I must be missing something.  If you equip this, you have a total of +5
AC from your primary/secondary melee slots, because it is 2HB.

If you stay with your current setup, you have a total of +15 AC from your
primary/secondary melee slots.  Why does a +5 AC 2HB staff make you happy in
the AC department?

In the HP department, you lose 20 HP by switching (less whatever the +3 sta
gains you).

As far as int/mana goes, let's assume you have int over 200.  Over 200, each
int is worth 5.8 mana, I believe (or is it 5.6?).  So, with the staff, you
are getting 14*5.8 + 10 = 91.2 mana.  With your current setup, you get
5.8*10 + 45 + 35 = 138 mana.  Current setup is better for mana.  (Even if
you are lower than 200 int, your current setup is better.  That staff only
gives you more mana if 1 int == 17.5 or more mana, and it doesn't, ever).

Let's look at the stats, other than resists, and see what switching gives
you.

Str: net gain, 1.5 (the staff weighs .5 more than your current setup, so you
don't get the full benefit of +2 str).

Sta: +3 will get you more HP.  I don't know how many.

Agi and Dex:  Who cares...who cares?  Assuming you didn't do something
really bad at character creation time, these aren't stats a Mage should have
to worry about.

Wis: who cares?

Cha: Gain +5.  Might help a little with vendor prices, but will it be enough
to make it worth buying the staff?  If it is, that still doesn't mean you
carry the staff...it sounds more like a bank item, you pick up on the way to
the vendors, and put back before you go out and fight.

Now lets do resists.  Again, this is the change from switching:

Magic: +2
Fire: -2
Cold: +12
Poison: +11
Disease: +8

What you need to figure out is if the CR, PR, and DR are worth giving up 50
mana, 10 AC, and maybe some HP.  For most things you do, unless you are
exclusively a raiding Mage, the answer will be no.

Basically, this staff for you is resist gear.  It's a bank item that you
might bring out for raids.  Whether it is worth it for that depends on what
you've got in other slots.  You want to get the most resist bang for the
mana buck, so you want to put on your resist gear in the slots where it is
most efficient first, working toward that balanced point where you've got
good resists, but haven't given up too much mana.

For example, suppose you are going on a raid where you really need CR.
The cost of this staff is 4.17 mana/point of CR.  Suppose you have a +3 int
ring.  Replacing that ring on a raid with a ring with +8 CR (velium wedding
ring, +8 all resists, about 700 plat on my server).  That is only costing
you 2.175 mana/point of CR.  Suppose your other finger has a +4 int ring.
The cost of a +8 CR ring would be 2.9 mana/point of CR.

So, the order of equipping for CR would be: replace the +3 ring first, and
if you need more CR and still have a big enough mana pool, replace the other
ring, and if you still need more CR and have an acceptable mana pool, equip
the staff.

My recommendation: treat the staff as resist gear.  Go to the Bazaar, and
search for other resist gear for various slots, to get an idea of whether or
not, for your particular set of equipment, the staff makes sense as resist
gear, or if you are better off concentrating first on other slots.
