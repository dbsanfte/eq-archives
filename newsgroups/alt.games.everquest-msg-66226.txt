    I won't get into my usual frothing-at-the-mouth state over how a game
should be fun over realistic. But I will add this....

    I have a level 60 cleric. And a 35 ENCH. If they take away the
spellbook, it doesn't do ONE THING TO ME. Nothing. I don't hear people
threatening to quit EQ because the keys were removed from Velious ports, but
somehow losing the book will offend folks? Get over it. EQ should not be
about hazing the newbs. If you want the book left in to give folks something
to look forward to, fine; as Catbert once pointed out, simply not punishing
people as much seems like a benefit to the punishees. But don't give a
second thought to the whiny level 35 plusses that think if they had it hard,
everyone should. Using that reasoning we'd still be in caves, drawing
pictures on the walls with pointy rocks.
