Went through 60 in 2 hours or so in PoV with my BL - I'd never done 
60 in a Tier 2 zone - WOW.

This effect is worse for mages - we have more EP spells than any other
class.
 
BTW - were you getting into the homebrew before typing this?  :)  More
typos than I'm used to in your posts. :)

Without question one of the top 3 spells we get in PoP - This guy can
tank slowed Tier 2 mobs relatively well.  3800hp unbuffed.  With Belt
and Weaps 4150, with girdle and weaps 4400.  With full armor he takes
less than 60 DPS from an unslowed Blood Raven in PoN.  Only the 64
BL warder tanks better (among pets).

There is another issue in boosting a pets base HP - enrage.  Any mob that
hits for more than 380 has the chance of taking an unbuffed/unequipped
air-pet from 11% to dead without triggering enrage.  I usually get mine
buffed up to >10x the max hit of the mob we're facing - that way if he 
has to offtank he is almost guaranteed to enrage before dieing.

+50 HP on each of these.

Also, no-one has documented a melee DPS increase because of the elemental
damage on these.

Doesn't stack with Druid fire/cold resist buffs.

This scales up as you level - at 65 it does 2000 base.

Single target DS.  The group version is a spectral, "Maelstrom of Ro".

I get requests for this - and the quest is dead easy.  Cohesion gem drops
super common at PoI entrance, Oxidized Plate is droppable (so even on 
non FV servers you can buy it cheap) and you summon a Sapphire Bracelet -
hand them all to Cogswain in PoK and Voila'.

All luck of the draw - I turned in 5 once and got 2 BOV's and 2 Servants
of Marr and one other 62 spell.  Talisman I think.
