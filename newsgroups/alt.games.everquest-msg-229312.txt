Hell Rathe isn't worth the effort.  If the damn thing is at 100%, kill
it.  I don't care if there is some confusion about who pulled what
first.  Its fucking Rathe Mountains.  The giants pop all the time. 
Look for a few clues, don't try to KS.  But if you do, don't worry
about it.  I, even now when I go visit for fun, get killstealed all
the time.  I don't give a shit.  Another giant will pop within 15
seconds.  And for a Ranger to cry about kill stealing when all he had
allegedly done was to snare the thing.  He wasted 40 freaking mana and
1.8 seconds on it?  He's a Ranger!  Tell the moron to /tracksort
normal and head toward the one on the top.

Now if you had targeted something that was at 80% health, that's a
different story.  At 50, being a Ranger, he may have invested quite a
few hitpoints in killing that giant and a KS would be a big deal.  The
thing about Rathe is that if you try to get worked up about every
conflict, you won't survive.  The GM's don't give a shit, they won't
bother with Rathe.  You are on your own there.  A Ranger decides he
should get even with you by getting you killed?  Just remember that
you have better tools for that kind of thing than he does.
