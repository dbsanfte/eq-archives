Did you read my whole post or just one sentence?  First off, even if there
were widely available hack programs, disabling windowed mode would not stop
people from using them because it would still be perfectly possible to run
the program before starting EQ and using some hotkey combination to activate
it.  However, that is a moot point because there are are not and will not be
widely available memory hack programs.  Like I said, there is hardly
anything left client side that is useful to hack.  That is not an opinion,
that is a fact.  And like I said, hacking any of those few remaining things
is just asking to get banned.  Nobody is going to write or use hack programs
knowing that they will just get banned using them.  This is not really an
opinion either, as if you can find me a memory hack written in the past few
weeks or even months after the last mass banning I would be very surprised.
Even when there were many things to hack like /zone there were very few
people doing it.  The primary reason why Verant should enable windowed mode
is not because it's still technically possible to use memory hacks but
because nobody actually does any hacking.
