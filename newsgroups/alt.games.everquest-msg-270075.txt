Yes, yes, you've said so many times before.   I feel compelled to point out
yet again that you assume a level of perfect aggro control that is completely
unreasonable in EQ.  In general and especially for warriors.   Overall it
would likely "work" (for a low threshold of "work"), but would be outdone by a
similar "all one class" group of any other class.
