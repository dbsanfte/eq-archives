You kill the named mob in the area that you want to take over. So say you
have owls in north and south and want them to win in east. Go to the wolves
cave and kill the named or PH in there and they should put up defenders and
attack. Sometimes the war becomes very bugged tho. You can usually fix the
bug by wiping the named mobs out in each of the three camps.
