The game has now been running for 2 weeks, and that post on how to use thier
broker system has been up for over a week.  Yet if you do a broker search on
Mistmoore server (one of the highest population servers) with absolutely no
filters, the search returns no items for sale.  This is a sign that there is
something seriously wrong with the system.  And if you play a character who is
into tradeskills, not being able to easily sell your wares is a huge issue.

By comparison, Star Wars Galaxies and Horizons both had similar consignment
systems.  On the very first day in each game, there were dozens of items for
sale, and hundreds within the first two weeks.   If EQ's system is getting no
use at all within a similar time frame, theres some serious issues there.

You sure about that?   I'd like to think that they're not that stupid, but
prior evidence and all that.   They're currently running surveys on EQ1 trying
to determine how the player base would react to Sony offering items for cash.
It's a very short step from items for cash to levels for cash.

Not something I'm worried about, because if they allow either one I won't be
playing anymore.   But it is something they're giving real consideration to.
