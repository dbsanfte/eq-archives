Unfortunately, I feel the same way about SWG. My excitement at discovering the
game and reading the details a couple of years ago, has been replaced by
apprehension and disappointment in the way that certain aspects of the game are
being handled. Reading the official boards has also been a source of concern,
since anyone who disagrees with the more controversial changes in the game is
labled as a whiner or crybaby (or some other derogatory term). There seems to be
a high level of hostility in that community.
