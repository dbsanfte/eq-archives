Every one of my characters over 20--and most under--always have at least 10
peridots on them if not a stack or two.  Besides being for buffs, they're
lightweight "cash."  One for a sow, two or three of them for a port, three
for KEI, two for a paid temp, one for temp in-group.  Etc., etc., etc.

I almost always hand the cleric a couple gems at the start to cover my own
temperance or, if I don't need it, to make sure he can keep them on those
who do.  I'll even mention something about donating them in group to drop
the hint/spark the idea to the others.  (I'm obnoxious, what can I say.)

(Of course as I say this, I *totally* forgot to give our Cleric dots
tonight.  He's a guildie, I'll catch up with him later.)

FEED YOUR CLERICS!

(And if you really need that Rune IV or higher, your Enchanter.)
