CB isn't really a dungeon with training wheels, it has little in the way
that makes it a dungeon and lots in the way that make it a close second for
Grand Central Station.

Befallen, Kurns, (BB still has trains, but it definitely is a good zone to
learn how to effectively navigate dungeons), and then Nurga as you get in
your high 20's, low to mid 30's are some good dungeons.  Befallen is hit or
miss on Povar sometimes it's busy and train central and sometimes it's empty
and great.
Warrens is on the train heavy side, but it's a good dungeon to learn how to
pull in them and it's possible to make several hundred plat or even a few
thousand in a few days there.

Sol A is starting to become less and less used on Povar, so I would add that
to the list and so is Najena.  Lava seems to have a load of dungeons that no
one uses which is perfect to learning how to fight in dungeons.
