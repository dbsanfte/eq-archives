I dunno, but I hate it that no one trades anymore.  I refuse to stand
around in the bazaar to sell off equipment just to get some pp to buy
something with.  That why I just sell if off to a lower level player for
next to nothing, take that little plat they give me, bank it and move on.

I used to love going to EC with some things to trade and seeing what I
could get for what I had.
