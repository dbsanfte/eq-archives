Fire opals...
they drop from mobs too, like low-mid 40s+. Genni will quest sell them to
you, for 550 gold. Some people say plat works but I have never tested it...
Fire opals are not lore and are stackable, being a jewelcraft gem. Hope this
helps... if you got any more questions feel free to email me even,
shane0009@home.com
Enjoy
