To be honest, I'd probably say that it went against Brad and companies
much maligned Vision(tm).  The people we have running EQ now are very
different from the people who started it up.

I have no doubt that it was also inspired by the fact that
subscriptions have probably flattened out, if not even started to
decline, but I don't think that this is the kind of thing that the
makers of EQ ever planned on happening.
