I was apparently mis-informed.  I've only been there twice.  And the first
time I was hunting Geonids, which shows how much I was paying attention. 
For those that don't know, Geonids are good exp and the "named" geonids
drop gems worth over 100pp every time.  The downside is that the leader of
the Geonids, Phenocryst, gives a very nice caster item as a quest reward. 
If your guild is planes capable with around 12 people, you can probably
finish the one fight required.  And unless someone else grabbed one of the
crystals, there's no camping involved, everything you need will just be
sitting on the ground somewhere, or is a common drop, or an NPC will give
you one on request.  Your reward is basically a Glowing Black Stone, except
with +3 to all resists and +5 vs magic.  But only if Phenocryst likes you. 
On the other hand, if I can't improve my faction with Phenocryst, I know
how I'm going to get both level 44 and a few thousand pp.  After all, with
that kind of money, I can always try to buy a GBS.
