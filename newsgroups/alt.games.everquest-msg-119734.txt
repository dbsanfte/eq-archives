GMs can't do squat unless it's a particular player that gets reported
multiple times and they happen to catch it in the act (it has happened,
it's funny how many habitual jerks are out there).

My favorite KS story:

Scene: Velks, camped to hell, you could walk from bottom to castle and
and back several times and never see a mob
Me (monk): pulling for Eyes camp

I'm hovering about the area right beneath eyes where 3 spiders and 2
statues spawn, waiting for any of them to pop.  Spider pops 2 inches
from me, I tag it, and beat feet to eyes camp.  Oh look there's that
stupid shaman from frenzy that has taken several eyes spawns right out
from under our noses.  I make it halfway back to eyes, only to see the
spider rooted in place just behind me.  The shaman.  "What gives bear?",
"My pull", "I hit it first", "No I did", "Oh yeah, root, great pull
spell"... he ignores me, slows it, dots it and then begins to JBB it.
Fuck this, enough is enough.  I then proceed to destroy the spider.
Piece o' cake when it's already been slowed (wasn't even epic at that
point).  I laugh.  He shoots many angry tells saying I've been reported,
etc.  I laugh some more and thank him for slowing my pull.  And get that
exp.  The situation was only made better when 30 minutes later I got to
watch his fat-ass bear corpse getting dragged from frenzy along with the
rest of his group.  My eyes group then moves on up to frenzy.  Hoo ya.
