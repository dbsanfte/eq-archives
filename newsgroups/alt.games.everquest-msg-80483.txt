The info on this page is a bit out-dated... I think it is pre-Kunark, and is
definately pre-Sullon Zek... but many of the concepts explained are still
very much worth the time to read.

Note the info on Tallon Zek says there is an alliance between the 'light'
races (human, elf, & shortie) against the Evil team, but that alliance may
have fallen into shambles.  Many on the Shorty team (dwarves, gnomes, and
halflings) were fighting to destroy the alliance last I played on Tallon.
It got so bad that no one trusted any shorty anymore, even ones who belonged
to cross-teaming guilds.  I do not know if the alliance between the Humans
and the Elves survived the stress and the mistrust fostered by the Shorties'
trechery....
