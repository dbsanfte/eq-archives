Maybe you should take some of your own advice here, dweeb.

Sure fooled a lot of people on that one.

Why don't you contact them then? You had better leave the legal matters to
those trained for it. You are just a little locker room lawyer and have no
idea of which you speak.


Speaking of clues, get one for yourself. Telling someone to "Try to hack
their machine" after you made a not so veiled threat to do so is not giving
"consent". You tried to use that little manuver thinking it would get you
off the hook. Nice try. You made the threat, now you are afraid of the
repercussions of carrying out that threat. Grow some balls. I have pissed on
better people than you.

Good day and good bye little stannypoo.
