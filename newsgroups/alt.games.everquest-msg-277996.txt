    You put more thought into it than I did.  I don't even know where I
parked Teapray.  I might guess the POK or Bazaar, but I really don't
know for sure.  I always thought that when the time came for me to leave
EQ, it would be hard for me, and I'd want to do it in some sort of
special way.  In reality, though, it just became more and more of a
chore to play, till finally one day I realized that I hadn't worked up
the energy to log in for a while, and wasn't in any particular desire to
do so, at all.  I think I canceled my account when I realized that I
hadn't logged in for two months, and it was silly for me to keep paying
on it.

   But as you say in a later post, I wasn't tempted even for a second to
sell my account.  For one thing, as low as all my girls were, I doubt I
would get more than a nickel.  But more than that... I don't relish the
idea of anyone, anywhere, thinking to themselves "Wow, Teapray used to
pretty cool.  When did she become such an asshole?"
