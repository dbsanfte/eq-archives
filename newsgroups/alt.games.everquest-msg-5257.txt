Not sure if I should use the newsgroup to vent a frustration, but here goes:

I was happily camping on orc hill and decided to drop down to the next hill
just over the edge on the cb side.  I see this orc centurion hauling ass
towards Kelethin.  I left clicked on him no damage was done by the looks of
it so I cast my root spell.  Then I quickly move over to get a better view,
and while the green lights are flickering on him still I decide to cast
shock of lightning.  From the Kelethin side this guy comes FLYING over the
hill and starts wailing on the orc, by this time I've got him half dead and
was in the middle of another shock of lightning spell when he starts yelling
at me to stop.  Too late my second shock of lightning toasted the orc and
all was said and done, the guy continues to bitch at me saying I was kill
stealing and he was going to petition a GM, I told him to go right ahead
because when he came over the hill he could still see my root spell taking
effect.

Fine I let this one slide.

So then a few minutes later I target another cent sitting on his butt and
this OTHER guy decides to attack when he TOO can see my root spell taking
affect, another cent comes over to help his friend beat up on the PC and
then the other JACKASS decides to come in and start wailing on the two orcs
too.

So finally I give up and move to cb and added this guy to my ignore list.

Am I right or wrong?

To prevent something like this happening again is there a way to save the
dialog that appears in the dialog box?

Thanks
