Before I cancelled my accounts I played NBG all the way from being
a badly equipped newbie to being an uber duper elementally equipped
raider. My opinion didnt change based around how well it would benefit
me - places that dropped caster only gear, or where the drops were
guarenteed to be below my current gear level.

I made a lot of friends on the way... either people are really unlucky,
rub other folks up the wrong way, or I am really naive, but I have
never seen much evidence that I was being ripped off left right and
center as the no-NBG'ers seem to imply. Despite this approach I ended
up with a 100k horse, my alt druid in FT10 gear, etc,etc. Its not like
if you dont only look out for #1 you end up impoverished and crapped
upon.
