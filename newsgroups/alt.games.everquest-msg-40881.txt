Today, i had someone steal 3 of my kills. he claimed he was "camping" the spire
and that it was his, and when i attacked it (which i attacked first) he started
attackin it too. I petitioned it and told a guide and zoned into paw to fight,
and the guide said he had to witness it. So...........i didnt care, so later, i
went out an hour later, and he did THE SAME THING, and this time i asked a
guide to come to SK to witness it themselves, but at the same time i decided to
go to bed, so i logged off.

My question is this: why are people so rude especially when i attack it first?
this is the first time i had a problem with this and im level 36. i think the
guy was just being a jerk, and i dont think ill even see him online again since
ive been there for 10 levels and never saw him before. and also is there any
way to record the game so i can send it in real mail to a guide so they can
see? or is the game only capable of taking pictures?

thanx
