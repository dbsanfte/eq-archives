See? Now if you'd started a wizard, you'd have that wonderful little
spell, "Translocate Cazic" in your book just for winners like this. Hey,
if they're silly enough to hit the "yes" button on the confirmation
box...

"Oh, I'm sorry. Cazic is right next to Common in my spell book. Must
have mixed them up. Boy, do I have egg on my face now, or WHAT?"

Or, better yet, make sure you're grouped with them.

"I've got a Hate Stone, and I'm not afraid to use it."

Incidentally, you'd be shocked how many people will just apparently hit
"yes" on confirmation without reading. I was doing taxi service last
night for a VS raid, running around sending everyone to DL. (Translocate
Combine).  The first guy I picked up was in NK. I did the TL for him and
sat down to mem a port to my next pickup. In the raid channel a second
later the guys says, "Ummmmm.. what am I doing in West Commons?"

DOH!

Hey, I'm new at this stuff.
