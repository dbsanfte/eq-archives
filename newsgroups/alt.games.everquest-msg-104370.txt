Sounds a lot like my house.  Six cats and three dogs.

I "ROFL'ed" at your earlier comment because with six cats,
we routinely do a "cat check" to make sure all six are
accounted for.  Otherwise, it'd be easy for one to vanish
for quite some time before we noticed that the cats rotating
across laps or the couch consisted of only five distinct ones.

As for animals on the EQ player, the wiener dogs displace
the cats very effectively, although instead of on the lap
they have a fetish for being wedged between your lower back
and the back of the chair, cross-wise like a lumbar pillow.
It's actually rather comfortable.
