I play a 34 druid on Tunare.
Since the last patch, I cant seem to get to the characters selection screen.
I log in, select server, get the EQ babe screen, and my hard drive light is
going as usual.  When it seems the characters select screen should come
up.....everything stops.  The music continues, but, the only way to get the
EQ babe screen to go away is reboot.....total lock up.

I have an amdk6 350, 128 megs of ram, voodoo3 3000 agp running the original
drivers (I once upgraded, and had to reformat as it crashed the shit out of
my system).
Dx8.....

I redownloaded the patch for the game, etc.  No luck.  Emailed verant, and
still havent heard back.

Any ideas?
