Here's a clue for you - porters are not your personal bitches.

If someone is going to be asking for a port - the third most annoying
thing in EQ beyond begging and asking for rezzes - then they ought to
shut up and take what they can get.

If they don't like it, they can WALK.

Complaining because you went to BB instead of GFay is probably the
most pathetic thing I've heard all month. A L1 can get from the druid
ring to GFay in complete safety.
