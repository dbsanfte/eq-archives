Xiphos's post isn't on my news server yet, so I'll respond to this reply. 
People enjoy different aspects of the game, and I have no gripe with anyone 
who has the most fun leveling a character at whatever pace or to whatever 
level they desire.  All that is important to me is that at whatever level 
you are you know what you're doing as fas as your class is concerned.  One 
problem I find with making alts is how can I not level?  Sure a certain 
amount of exploring is fun the first time around and sure tradeskills are 
time consuming, but seeing the church in Kaesora or the ice statues in Thurg 
or the pictures on the mountains in East Karana is really only exciting the 
first time or two.  Doing these things over with a new character doesn't 
really renew the excitement.  There are quests to do, and I'm a big fan of 
quests.  Mosts quests in EQ involve killing mobs and then returning with 
their drops.  Killing those mobs is going to earn xp, which will eventually 
result in leveling.  I'm not going to feel cheated if my alt BL never goes 
to xp in Unrest or Chardok.
