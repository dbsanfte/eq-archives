Against most replies ... I would say SK.
Monk has way more DPS than the SK but SK is together with Pally the
second best Tank.
A good friend of mine payed a Shammy/Monk duo untwinked from 1 to 60 and
post 50 it was terrible how ineffective the team was (after monk nerf)
as the shaman needed to blow too much Mana to heal.
I am playing Ogre SK (no stun rocks) and Troll Shaman on a new European
Server and the team rocks.

Problem with Monk is: No abilitiy to get Agro. So main dmg source of the
team will be the Monk, So that Shaman doesnt have too much Agro.

With SK as Tank you can slow and stick all your dots on Mob and SK has
agro in a sec.
The Mana you use on DoT is less than you would use on Heals for Monk.

another example: In PoP Monkfriend needs to pull with disc, as Both
chars would die when first slow wont fit. You wont have the same problem
with an SK.

To add a little to that: There are way more Iksar Shaman/Monk Teams out
there than any Shaman/SK Duos =)
