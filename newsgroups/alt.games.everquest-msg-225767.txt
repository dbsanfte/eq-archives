I've seen that the xp from LDoN adventures is very good. However, last 
night I participated in one where I was at the bottom of the level range 
for the group. I noted that I gained less than *half* the xp that I 
normally do when I'm in the middle or upper range. I expected less, but I 
was disappointed to see just how much less.

Of course, I'm sure it was also due in large part to the fact that it was a 
22 collect and we didn't stick around to clear much more of the dungeon 
after success.  :P

Has this pretty much been everyone else's experience (no pun intended)?
