In fact, i am an enchanter Lvl 8 and i was very boring because i can't have
the spell Mircyl Animation.
With the information of different people, i have understand that i could
found this spell in High Pass.
i have take ration and food, and i 'm going from Felwithe to HP with my
spell Invisibility.
During my long travel, i have met people that said that it was impossible to
go to HP for a Lvl 8.....
But i  have been in HP (Freeport,, est commonland, west Commonland.......),
with lucky perhaps but i have win.
When i want , i can, and you also you can ......
