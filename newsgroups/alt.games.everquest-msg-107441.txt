Ghetto tracking at its best.

Mem Flare, bring up pet.
/pet kill quillmane
/pause 1
/pet target
/pause 1
/assist

if Quill is targeted - cast flare.

It's still a race though.
Usually I'd /assist the mob to see
if anyone had it - but I doubt it 
would work at the range I'd stop to
cast Scars.  Personally I'd use Scars
over any other spell - it's not big
enough to KS, and it's the fastest
nuke we have.
