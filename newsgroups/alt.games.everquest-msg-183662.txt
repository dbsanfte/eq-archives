The items cost about 30pp to buy and you get 60pp as a reward (unless that's
been nerfed, too). You can't MQ it because Trep gives you a 6-slot container
that you fill and combine, and I'm pretty sure the items are all no-drop.

Good classes go to Bazaar, Thurg, Shadeweavers, Qeynos, W Freeport and FV. There
is an alternate series for evils.
