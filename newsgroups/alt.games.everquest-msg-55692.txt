  I'm building a new computer in a couple months, and plan on making a grand
return to EQ.  Though I left EQ for a number of reasons, one of the main
things that really drained my patience with the game was the whole mess of
technical issues that were brought on by the move to DirectX7 a while back.
After those patches, sound never worked quite properly for me again, despite
the fact that I replaced my soundcard.  Apparently some people are STILL
having problems with SB Live! cards, which was what I considering putting in
my new box, until now.

  With the impending move to DX8, the whole nightmare may replay itself all
over again, though I'm certainly hoping it won't.

  So, since I'll be starting more or less from scratch with my new computer,
it'd be nice if I could know beforehand what hardware people haven't exactly
had the best experience with in EQ (or even in general).

  If anybody knows of an easily referenced list on the web, or anywhere, I'd
appreciate anybody who could direct me to it.  I browsed the official Tech
Support forum a bit and that's giving me a bit of an idea, but more info
never hurts.

  Otherwise, if you just want to reply to this message, stating whatever
problems you've had with EQ and what hardware/software component on your
system you suspect is causing the problem, I'd appreciate it.

  So far, I think my plan is to go with a Shuttle KT266A motherboard, a
GeForce3 TI200 graphics card, an Athlon XP 1500+ or 1600+ and Windows XP
(home edition).  Not quite sure what kind of modem (yes, I'm still stuck
with 56k) or what kind of soundcard I should get.  If anybody has any
recommendations about a non-Creative Labs sound card that works particularly
well with EQ, please let me know (preferably with a street price of under
$60 or so).  Though budgetary constraints or my research/feedback here might
change my mind.

  Thanks. :)
