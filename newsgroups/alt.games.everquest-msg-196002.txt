I'm having trouble getting the game to startup usint McAffee firewall.
I am using Windows XP Home and have all the expansions to EQ.

I have the firewall set to allow eqgame.exe and Everquest.exe full
access and I have set the firewall to NOT inform me of Events. I have
the security set on the firewall at the miuddle point of the
slider....Standard Security, Inform me when new applications attempt
to connect...

When I start up EQ I get to the login screen and it locks up before I
can type in my password and I have to physically turn off the power to
my computer in order to break out of the program.

I am hesitant to shut down the firewall as it has informed me that my
computer is being hit a lot by a couple of other computers and has
blocked access. Not that I have anything important on this computer
but it's mine, not theirs!

I'd like some suggestions if anybody has anything constructive to
offer.... or if anybody has experienced the same thing I'd like to
know how you dealt with the problem.
