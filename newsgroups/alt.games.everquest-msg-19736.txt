I agree that it would be nice to know what kind of units we're dealing with.
On the other hand, they could take the "touch of realism" too far and
introduce several different weight systems, one supposedly invented by each
race/nation/whatever.  They could do the same with the money.  Can you
imagine the headaches if you had to convert a dozen different money systems
back and forth in your head daily?  I lift the passage below verbatim from
my second edition AD&D rulebook (copyright TSR, copyright Wizards of the
Coast, blah blah blah, it's just an example so don't sue me):

"Take, for example, the situation of a mercenary captain in Aquitaine.
Through wages, booty, and trading he has assembled quite a few coins.
Foremost of his hoard are the gold and silver coins of Byzantium -- the
besant, hyperpyron, or nomisma as they were known at different times. An
Italian general paid him in coins almost equally valuable, the gold florin
and ducat. Mixed in with these were other coins of the Italian states --
silver grossi and ecu. From the French he collected gros tournois, Rouen
pennies, and louis. A Moorish hostage bought his freedom with silver
drachmas and a German merchant of the Hanse paid the heavy toll of a gold
mark. Part of the spoils of war include solidus aureus and denarii of
Ancient Rome, though these coins are so badly worn that their value has
dropped greatly. One of his men even came across a hoard of hacksilver
bracelets! Finally, from his English employers he received pounds,
shillings, and pence.  Clearly the captain is faced with a problem when he
tries to figure out just how much money he has. What do all these coins add
up to?"

Most people can't even keep one measurement system straight.  I spent 18
months in a graphic arts school, and several guys in my second-year class
couldn't find the eighth-inch marks on a ruler. I could handle two or three
different in-game weight or cash systems (in fact, given the number of
fantasy games I've played, it would be more than fair to say I have handled
it) but most people can't.  I bet part of the reason the units aren't given
is because people will immediately begin to disagree with the weights of
things.  No one can say "no way is my armor that heavy" when they don't
actually know how heavy it is.
