    Yup, that's one of the many issues with it. And it's something you need
to be comfortable with.

    Points also helps get "sunshine players" to come to raids. I don't think
it does much for overall attendance beyond that, though. At least in the
case of my guild, people aren't online because they have lives. They won't
be logging on whether there's points or no points.

    Um, you are relying on someone else's judgement - whoever set the point
costs and the raid points awarded in the first place. And there can be huge
class biases built into those points. As just one posible example, a given
melee/all item might be the best item in game for a ranger in that slot, but
not so hot for a monk or a warrior. If a warrior is the one deciding points,
he's going to cost it lower than if a ranger costed it. And that means the
rangers will gain an edge on all/all drops. Not that you'd mind that. ;-)

    So you'll have rots of useful items because people are saving towards
something else, you'll have items going to classes that you'd never
otherwise award the item to (congrats bard on Ifir, Dagger of Fire!), and
you'll have "spite bidding" where people specifically bid on items to deny
them to others. These things happen in the other big points guilds on my
server, don't kid yourself into thinking they won't happen with you.

    And as you'll soon find out, every other ranger can do the same thing
and you'll be just as blocked out of the "star" loot as before. The only
"choices" you get in a points system are the ability to be rewarded for time
put in versus all the other biases in officer award, and the ability if you
are tops in points to accept or decline every drop as it comes in. If you
aren't number one, you get scraps.

    Here's the one on the one guild's points site: "Exploring Ssra Temple".
Those are points awarded to people for spending time farming key components
for the Emperor key, because if you didn't award points for it people would
leave after they got theirs and the unlucky folks would be stiffed big time.
Tell me how you keep track of that, considering it takes maybe four people
to farm that stuff now. "Yeah, we were there three hours after raiding
ended. No, we didn't get anything. Guess we have to go back tomorrow night,
har har!"

    Remember, once you have a points mentality the people in guild won't get
out of bed unless points are involved. So ANYTHING you want done, like
farming quest components, doing a shawl skirmish for someone, etc. all need
points attached to them or they won't get done. And as soon as you assign
points to something that cannot be monitored, it will be abused.
