Why spend 10k plat just to train up to 250 skill so you can make velium
items, when for far less than that you can buy them pre-made? If you
*want* to that's one thing, but if the end result is just to "have" the
items, it's cheaper to buy them pre-made.

>Velium the same price as platinum?

Yes, velium items now sell for same as plat used to on Prexus. I was in
the process of training up to 200 skill so I could start to "make money"
with my jewelcrafting skill the week before they announced and
implemented skills going to 250. As soon as I could make a plat ruby
veil, which was selling for  about 750-800pp, the skill went to 250, and
every high level jewelcrafter who could afford the thousands of plat to
get to 250 did so, and the prices immediately changed to about 450-500
for a plat ruby veil (which I can't make at my sub-250 skill and sell
for that without losing hundreds of plat), 800 for a velium one.

Uh, enchanters serve a much larger purpose than making jewelry. I'm not
sure where this talk about leeching from a guild came from, but assuming
for the hell of it that he joined a guild that had access to
jewelcrafted items, who the hell is going to blame a new enchanter for
not blowing 5-10k plat to train JC?
