Ok, I need that thing. Seems like not too many people visit Droga. I
can understand that as I ran through it invis for a visit tour. A
million spellcasting level 35 mobs, standing very close to each
othe, roamers etc. That's a death trap, even for a level 60. I
was 53 and gave up my soloing intetions in there. A group of the
normal 55+ guildies should of course cut through it like butter,
but it's hard to get even 1 person to camp greenies with you
for hours. I found the temple far down where that Fanatic Goblin
is supposed to spawn (near the named down there). So .. does anybody
accurately know how often it spawns and how often that stone drops?
