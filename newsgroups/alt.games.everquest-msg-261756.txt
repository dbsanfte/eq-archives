Me, for one. One of the advantages of EQ running like shit before is 
that turning on the shadows hasn't really made a difference for the 
worse.

Good luck finding diffuse shadows on *any* game, even Doom 3. It may be 
a feature of the upcoming Unreal 3 engine, but I doubt it.

I would have preferred a simple blurry elliptical shadow for positioning, 
rather than what we got, but any shadows at all are better than none, as 
far as I'm concerned.
