I never got more than a pp for the lightstone trade in (less I think), but the GLS trade in is indeed quite
lucrative (same deal, you hand in the stone, get a book you can sell) and the lightstones are a bit extra unless
you are running low on room.  A possibility is to sell the lightstones to lowbies who can use them for experience
quite handily, its hard to make more on the GLS then you get for the trade in, but the Lightstones used to sell for
better than their book sale value.

I think, though, that you'll make better money killing gargoyles in OOT than hunting wisps.  They drop something or
other worth around 10pp, and you can run back over to the sister island to sell occaisionally without having to
travel halfway round the world to a quest giver.  I think you'll find you come up with more than 100pp per hour
this way

The item I see selling most in bazaar (by selling I mean moving, instead of being offered) is food.  Stat foods are
a nice boost to your stats, since they don't require taking off a piece of equipment, but just add in more stats;
think how much you'd pay for an earring with 5 more wisdom than what you are wearing, say...  Since you inevitably
end up eating the foods eventually, you need more, so unlike most tradeskill items there's an endless demand.

I don't know, though, whether competition has lowered food prices down to where there's no profit left in the
trade.
