Kurns Tower off of the field of bone, its great for leveling, and is a
really is an awesome looking zone too.

While there go to the island in FoB to go see The Tangrin, you most likely
will die, pretty large aggro radius.

Explore Thurgadin if you havent visited it before.

Also check out Great Divide to see some wurms.

Just for kicks, jump in The Hole, make sure you are nekked :)

Permafrost is pretty cool.

Lavastorm is neat.

In 30 days, you could probably check out most things.  Oh yeah if you
never made a Dark Elf, make one and check out Neriak.  Cool city.
