That's all I needed to hear.

Pickup groups in the Oasis or LOIO or OT or DL /= good experiences.

Notice the "s" after experience.

I've often grouped an alt with a guildee's alt in some of those
places, because they do offer good leveling experience.  They
do NOT seem to be places the best players tend to congregate,
though.

Any place where the /ooc conversation is flying fast and furious
and includes "pRon" "plz" "d00d" and "ph34r m3" is probably
not going to end up being lots of fun.
