Well, I had no problem getting to 10 with my Monk, but monks start off in a 
better DPS mode than most, as they get DW at Level 1.

I shudder to think of a Rogue starting out though.

My biggest twink expenditure on my monk? Bandages. More bandages. Yet more 
bandages.

Of course, I ended up stripping my original main to equip my monk, but in 
the long run that tied in to the fact that my monk *is* my main now.
