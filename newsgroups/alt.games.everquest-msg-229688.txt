They have added new ui files, or changed some of them since you created the
new folder and copied the default folder to it along with the new ui files
you have loaded for your custom ui. Also when an item is changed in the
default folder, the custom ui stuff needs to be updated by the creator to
the latest revision.

It is a hassle to keep up with the ui changes. You need to copy the default
folder to your custom folder and overwrite the exsisting files, then over
write the custom folder with updated custom ui files from the creator, ie go
to the website you got the ui files from and get the updates if they are
available.

Chances are you are missing a lot more of the latest default ui than you
realize if you have been getting the message for that long. This is probably
hard to understand by my poor explanation, but I tried.
