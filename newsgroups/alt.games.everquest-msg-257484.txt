Yeah, I'd have to agree with this.  While it does generate some agro just
because you're doing some damage, it certainly doesn't compare to melee agro
in other forms (actually meleeing with close-range weapons) or spells (wizzy
nukes, shammy/enchanter slow, cleric heals).

I really don't understand why rangers are upset about their DPS.  For their
role, their DPS is fine.  And their ability to pull in a number of
situations is surpassed only by monks and bards from what I've seen.  If you
want melee DPS, I say go play a rogue, monk, or even a berserker.

And on an only quasi-related note: rogues and bers have roughly the same DPS
when similarly equipped.  My rogue at 65 was doing the same damage output
with two Piercing weapons that I've seen done with the few 65 berserkers
I've grouped with 2H Slash.  Major difference was the location.  If you want
the off-tank ability of the ranger, go berserker.  If off-tanking's not your
thing, go rogue.  Or if you like pulling, go monk.
