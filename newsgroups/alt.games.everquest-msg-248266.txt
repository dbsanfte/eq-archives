I don't believe 'The Twenty' can be aimed well at certain movies. If
tends to be an all usage before every film and I don't think they do
multiple versions. If your 'trailer' is setup to be shown at PG-13 and
R rated movies.. then it is probably a traditional trailer like any
other. Its long been known that the MPAA dictates trailers for movies
rated R can only be shown at R rated films. And PG-13 can't be shown
at G rated films. This is so you don't get a perception of marketing
more adult films to people who can't get into them, and possibly
showing violence they wouldn't normally see as part of the trailer.
Its reasonable and been a standard for a long time.

Oh, and just for the record... I'm one that likes to show up to the
theater with some time to spare.. and i've thankfully found a cinema
in my area that doesn't show that retarded 'The Twenty'. I want to
kick little puppies every time it comes on. I want to put a bullet in
my head to end the pain. I want to jump off a bridge just to see what
it feels like. Yes... i hate it that much.
