Big "If", and one I don't subscribe to. The various omnis are rife
with paradox.

The first page is a set of assumptions. The rest is just... "if the
conditions set forth in the assumptions are true then the universe
would unfold thusly". But that doesn't give us any insight into how
'the conditions set forth in the assumptions' initially come about.

Genetic freaks. Took me 2 words. <g>

To be less flippant I personally beleive the physical universe might
not be able to withstand the sort of physical law violations that
dropping a talking fish into my aquarium would entail. And I don't
define omnipotence in such a way as to expect deities to be able to
sustain a paradox... (ie I don't think a god's inability to prove true
is false using propositional logic is a failing). Basically perhaps
God is bound by the laws of energy conservation etc when interacting
with the universe ... perhaps because to violate them would destroy it
(as paradoxes would abound). And thus getting all stompy with a 10,000
foot manifestation isn't practical.

I saw a picture of a talking fish and read about a guy who bumped into
God in a field in the local tabloids. ... Bunch of crazy liars...or
maybe the evidence you seek is out there after all <g>.
