The fondest memory I have is when I found the 1000 ft waterfall in
Stonebrunt. I climbed and climbed, and didn't think I was climbing
any more. But when I hit F9 to take a look at it, I realized how far
up I was. Thank Karana my enchanter had batwings for his levitation
spell. I actually got a bit dizzy looking down from that height. I also
got the same fuzzy feeling when I ran thru Jagged Pine to the new
zone for the Wayfarer Brotherhood. I just stood in one place and
pushed my clipping as far as it would go. These zones just SCREAM
for giants or something to look eye to eye at that height. And the
first run up the cliff to HHK that my paladin took made me want
to write Verant up and beg for giant ants to crawl there. Maybe
I have been watching too many B rated 50's horror flicks. hehe
