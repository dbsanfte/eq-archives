    Before Velious, if you wanted spells you'd likely get some just by
hunting in the high-level areas available in the game. Now, since other
high-level areas are available, people have to "camp" their spells
specifically. Because this could be a huge pain for players, they're
lowering the camp time.

    At least that's how I'm reading it. ;-)
