I can't find a patch archive going back to Aug or Sept 1999. What I DO 
remember was VI (Brad or GZ) saying that if your back was to the mob you 
would only do 2/3 damage but if the mob had it's back to you it would do 
full damage. Ah well.. it really doesn't matter now.. it's officially 
unnerfed now I guess.
