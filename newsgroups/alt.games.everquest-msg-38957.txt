I love it. :)

}that's excitement.  I was literally shaking when I got to the otherside.

Man, I love it when it gets that intense.  It's amazing that a videogame 
can actually get us that involved.  The other night I stupidly got myself 
whacked in the ass/sup in guk.  My partner was AFK, and I just thought I'd 
poke my nose downstairs to see what I could see from the bottom of the 
ladder.  

Taunting attacker, master

Yes, I know, I'm an idiot for even thinking of having a chanter pet in a 
dungeon, but it was a fun idea at the time. :) Anyway, I got back, and 
found a cleric who'd give me a rez if I dragged over to the king room... 
Hmm... never been to live side, glad I have a map.  So I got most of the 
way there, and the cleric in question comes barreling down the hall with a 
froglok noble and another frog on my butt, then goes barreling back.  Hmm, 
I'm invis, should be fine... 'you appear' doh!  I'm back in Innothule.  So 
the cleric was still dealing with that, clearly, so I left him alone and 
tried again.  He was 49+, so another death wouldn't be the end of the 
world, but still, annoying. :)  I got back down almost to where the bodies 
were, coming by a different route from the live side zone. Suddenly, I 
appear and get whacked at by a shaman froggie I just passed.  Ngaah!  
rootresistrootresistrootsticksyay! Back up ten feet...

/screamtoself AAAgggh! I'm an idiot! I didn't re-mem gate!!

Whack, a big-ass minotaur hits YOU for some points of damage

rootresistrootsticks omg, it's my lucky night! Back up ten feet... the 
rooted shaman whacks me!  Aigh, wrong way!  Back up ten more feet and 
around a corner, sit, forget some stupid buff, remem gate, stand up, 
notice health now at a tiny sliver, cast.

You begin to cast gate
Your Immobilize spell has worn off
Loading, Please Wait...

I appear in Innothule still alive.  Whehew.  I look down at my hands... 
They don't shake that much even after six cups of coffee.  /tell cleric 
aheh, I'm going AFK a minute, I really, _really_ need a smoke...

It scared the bejeezus out of me and was mostly my own stupidity, but 
damn, I loved that rush.

}If I still smoked I would have had a cigarette.  That was intense.

Lucky me, I still smoke.  Not. :/  Grats on staying quit!

I remember my own scariest run through Cabilis, the time I figured invis 
was enough without bothering with Illusion: Iksar.  Luckily, some shammy 
had just given me a very high-level SoW at the docks in Oasis, and since 
I'd lev'd to the firepot room in about 15 minutes, I had just enough 
left to train to the zone with a couple big ugly iksar necromancers 
zapping my butt when invis wore off just outside their front door...  
zone, see scary guard, re-zone, phew they wandered off or are out of range 
still, reinvis, sit, and watch the DOTs come within a hair's breadth of 
killing me.
