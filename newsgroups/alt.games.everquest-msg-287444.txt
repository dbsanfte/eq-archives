i think the argument for why owners of the software can use it how
they please is something like this: since there is no copying or
distribution of the intellectual property, there is no infringement

it's like - you buy a CD, so you own a license to the copyrighted
music, yes?  if you like, you can rip the CD to mp3 and play it in
your portable device - at least as the law stands now

you can't, legally, give that mp3 to anyone or sell it or even keep it
if you sell/give away the CD


i think the stronger argument for why this private server might be
illegal would be that by changing the quests around, i may be creating
a derivative work or parody...but that doesn't really hold water, it's
just a thought
