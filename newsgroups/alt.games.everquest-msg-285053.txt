I'm trying to get to high amiable with King Tormax at the moment, so I'm 
particularly looking for details on those hits, but I'm surprised I 
can't locate a web site with good guesses at numbers on all sorts of 
faction hits.

For example, I got to the point where one coldain kill took me from 
dubious to glares with coldain, and then found that five frost giant 
scout kill took me from glares back to dubious.

Here's a faction list I found while browsing thru Alakhazam:
============================================================
Generic Faction Levels
-2000 to -751 ...scowls at you, ready to attack
-750 to -501 ...glares at you threateningly
-500 to -101 ...glowers at you dubiously
-100 to -1 ...looks your way apprehensively
0 to 99 ...regards you indifferently
100 to 499 ...judges you amiably
500 to 749 ...kindly considers you
750 to 1099 ...looks upon you warmly
1100 to ~2000 ...Ally faction

Faction hits for Bvellos Bounty Quest
+10 Kromrif
+10 King Tormax
+50 Kromzek
-20/-25 ClawsOfVeeshan

Supply Run (this may also require good kromrif faction).
+Kromrif (5 points) & +Kromzek (5 points) when handing the pack to Fjloaren
+King Tormax (2 points) for the second part of the quest.

Field Supplies also seems to be a good faction quest but no info on how 
big the faction hits are.
===========================================================
As you can see, not a lot of hard data, but at least a start.

I've done 17 heads to Bvellow, and a couple of the supply runs, and 
Field Supplies about a dozen times; I'm still dubious to frost giants 
(kromrif?) and just checked my Tormax faction for the first time, Glares 
Threateningly.

I don't know whether I started at Scowls, so I have no idea how far I've 
progressed.

Looking at the chart, once I hit Dubious (which might be anywhere from 1 
to 249 points away, depending on how Glares I am) I'll have 600 points 
to go, and even then, apparantly need "high amiable" for my current 
quest, which means up to 399 more points.

At 2 points each, the supply run would require 450 or so repetitions, I 
can assure you thats not going to happen.  Field supplies is even 
easier, so I'm betting it only gives one point to KT faction, so 900 
times?  Blah.

At least Coldain Heads is a possible, at 10 points each, we're looking 
at 90 heads, but since they only drop about one in ten times, thats 900 
coldain.  At best I'm getting an average of one wolfmaster per minute, 
simply because they don't line up quietly waiting for me to kill them, I 
have to run around looking for the next one to kill, and sometimes have 
to kill wolves to up the spawn rate.  So I'm looking at 15 hours of 
killing no exp mobs (which, at the moment doesn't matter as I'm at the 
level 60 cap and there's no AA to use exp on either)

This looks to me like an example of the sort of thing that EQ players 
would be eager to have available; knowing, for example, that to raise 
Kromzek faction its better to turn heads in to the Recruiter, while for 
Kromriff its better to turn them in to Bvellos... surely faction work is 
so prevalent in the early sections of EQ that actual figures would be a 
lot of help.

Berg, 60 SK, still Glared Threateningly at by King Tormax (probably anti 
gnome prejudice!)
