    Actually that is exactly what happens in free market economies. The part
that is not mirrored in EQ though is increases in efficiency and
productivity that help offset profits in positions of lowering prices.

    No matter how good a crafter or efficient camper someone is, the
mobs/tradeskills have a set spawn/prodcution rate. So you can never increase
your efficiency of production. Hence your costs( in time in EQ, as that is
what PP really measures) are always the same.

    That being said I still think that prices are going to noticably drop
once the Bazaar is opened in all it's glory. Sure there will be some
holdouts as there always will be, but there will also always be ppl there
that will undercut you too. It will be very interesting to see what happens.

    Of course to compare the economy of EQ to anything remotely like the
real-world is a waste of time anyways.
