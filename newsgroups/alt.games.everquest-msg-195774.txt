I don't know about that.  I suspect the bazaar will be an empty place there
for a while.  There will be no high level stuff in the bazaar, and no plat
for buying it if it were there.

Everyone will start with the same ability.  Lots of knowledge, but no way to
use it.  No plat ... plat will have to be earned.  Once earned, it will be
spent on low level items and spells.  There will be precious little plat to
go around for the learning of tradeskills.  Remember, someone will have to
be the first one to make a handmade backpack ... or banded armor ... or a
silver jasper ring.

My suspicion is that the new server will become kind of an old-folks home.
Only folks with the patience it takes to stare at a book for 35 levels will
be left after the second or third week.  Here's why I think that.

The newer players will be dying much more often than they're used to.  Orc 1
in EC may not be a challenge when you're in a full set of Crusty and every
caster in the group has a KEI, but it will be dang tough in tattered without
even a Breeze.  The folks who started playing after the "Go through 1 - 10
free" change was made will suddenly find lvl 10 to be a bitch.  Frustration
will set in, and those folks will most likely go back to their home servers
and play with their twinks.  The chaff will separate from the wheat.

Personally, I'm looking forward to a new life where "50p for a KEI" is
replaced by "Breezing for doantions, whatever you can spare".

Just my 2cp, fwiw.
