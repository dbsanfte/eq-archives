Well, he has a point for mages -

A) you can buy your 16 and 20 pets from the elf lady in
OOT.

B) If you wait until 24 to train it, you get the extra 8pts
of skill free (you get a base skill equal to your level when
you train first).

C) Mages have to chain research - you need the spell from the
level before to get the next one.

D) Most of a mages researched spells are obsolete 5 levels after
getting them.

E) You can get the 39 and 44 pets in Katta Castellum, and 49 and 
50 go by so quick that you only need to research a 49 pet if you
want fire to do the mob with the 2000dmg fire ae (can't remember,
Raksheva?).

F) Being forced to use pets other than your accustomed ones is 
good for a mage, because it teaches you new techniques.

G) When I still thought I need research, I expended all the words
and other components I hunted and bought with the only successes being
cornucopia (twice).

So - for a mage, train one point at 24, research Cornucopia and Everfount,
and don't worry about it otherwise.
