Let's see.

Option A:  Hunt greens for hours to get silk.  Piss off all the
    people hunting there for XP.  Get tailoring skill up where
    I want it.

Option B:  Waste a few hundred plat buying silk and spend
    time saved farming Dragon Necropolis for drops.  Get
    tailoring skill up where I want it and make a Kpp from
    the crap drops while getting XP.   And that ignores the
    possibility of a 20kpp PSC dropping and me winning the
    roll, etc.

Yeah, I thought about it.  He probably has too.

Anyone who's mining vendors is surely buying from players
in the zone as long as that's where the vendors happen to
be.   Anyone hunting spiders instead of buying from vendors
has made a decision about their time that's totally up to
them.   Personally, I can find a lot better uses of my time
than running around killing spiders than greened out long ago.
