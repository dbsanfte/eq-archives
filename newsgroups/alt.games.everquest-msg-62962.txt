Things like that used to happen a lot more than they do today. Before
Kunark raiding PoF was a big deal, which most people saw as pretty
darn spooky, risky, and even heartpounding sometimes. That's a natural
consequence of most your tanks using ykeshas and your nukeage is all
coming from wizard ice comets.

Now? A group of properly equipped L60 can zone in and beat everything
that comes at them at the entrance, if they want. People do PoF for
experience. Some classes can even solo there if the wandering spawn is
sufficiently broken up. Most guilds doing Fear for Cazic (not armor)
will clear parts of fear by basically training themselves over and
over, either cracking out the point blank AE or simply overpowering
the resulting train.

Temple pulls are especially fun that way. :-)

So yeah, for Fear that is unusual these days. And most other raid
zones in Velious and Kunark do not have deathtrap entrances, making
corpse summoning a breeze in case of a wipeout of the worst kind.
These days the only zone that still has that sort of threat is
probably PoG, and even it is nowhere near the danger Fear was
pre-kunark, or Hate before they safened up the entrance a bit.

No, this is a very common misconception. My guild could be called
"uber", it raids Sleepers and kills all but the last warder, along
with ToV north etc etc - not the best but certainly not a slouch - and
few of our people play more than 5 hours for a raid tops, 5 days a
week, and sometimes less.

Once you don't need to level and can just raid for fun, theres no need
to play for gigantic lengths of time unless you are trying to do
something epic in scale like clearing all of NToV at once... or PoA.
Air has always taken way more time than it should; our guild simply
never goes there.
