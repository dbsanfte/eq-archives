You can only loot someone's kill after it has been lying there for
over two minutes.

So most times if the kill hasn't been looted, it's because they don't
want it.  The usual exceptions are:

  1.  If they're still continuously killing stuff and haven't had a
      moment's peace to look the first kills yet.

  2.  If there's a No Drop item on it that one of their friends need,
      and the friend is on his way to loot it.

Generally though, if they're just sitting around and there's unlooted
kills lying on the ground, no one objects if you clean them up.

But it is polite to ask.

Usually, right away, but sometimes (for unknown reasons) it can take longer.

Two ways:

  1.  Turn your logging on (/log), and then use a log parser to
      pull the numbers out of your log and report them to you
      (or do it manually by watching for skill up messages and
      noting them on a piece of paper), or

  2.  Wait until your skill level is 101 or greater, at which point
      the numeric value will show up on top of your "master" word
      description for that skill on your in-game skill list.
