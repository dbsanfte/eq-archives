That helps a great deal. For one, it confirmed that you really are
*expected* to keep wiffling your class about to eventually get to what you
want to be.  And I didn't realize that you retain the abilities from the
other schools you've been in...I thought that you lost them as soon as you
swapped, thus negating all your work in that class.  Or is it still the
case that some abilities don't work?  I couldn't use a mage nuke when I
was a cleric, but perhaps that was because I was weilding an inappropriate
item, like a buckler?
