In game mechanics, tonnes, most notably the death penalty (halved),
the spell book, etc. In terms of the game? Everything. Its an entirely
different game. Different spells, level caps, world size, gear
availability, these things hugely change the dynamic of the game.

Its fundamentally different now. Faster, more arcadey, less epic,
less frustrating, less rewarding.

all IMO ;) I realise you were looking for specifics but... well, 
'minor' things like the fact nobody wears patchwork or that
rubicite is not the top end, or that not everyone is competing in
the same area really change things. Provision of thing like 
corpse summoning, rezzes, the change in /consent, etc... they all
mean its really barely the same thing.
