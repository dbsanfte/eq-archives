This is the part that makes it clear to me.  He wanted someone to
"fall" for a scam and they did.  He was not simply hoping to sell
something for a better-than-average price.  He was hoping to take
advantage of someone, and he did. Now the only decision is if you want
to stay in a guild that allows this kind of behavior.
