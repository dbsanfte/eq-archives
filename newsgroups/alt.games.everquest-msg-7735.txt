I plan on heading to EC this weekend to do some shopping with my just about 
level 32 Iksar monk. She's managed to accumulate about 650pp. Maybe more if 
by 
some freak chance I get a forest loop before then. Anyhow, she's mostly 
wearing cured silk, with a Foreman's tunic and a few odd items. Jewelry is 
pretty non-existent - 2 dervish rings, a +2 sta earring. I'm going to give 
her 
one orc fang earring from my warrior. I've gotten recommendations before to 
get a collar of undead protection and a pair of jagged bands. What else 
should 
I be shopping for? Am I correct in assuming I should go for AC above 
everything else? Even if that involves trading out an item that has +dex, 
+str, or +agi stats?

Thanks!!
Anita
