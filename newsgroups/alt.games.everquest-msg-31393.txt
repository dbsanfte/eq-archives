Solo 3 out of 5 once they get their snare spell.  "Ideal race" on ALL of
these is bullshit, though.  If you pick erudite but you really like gnomes
because of this, you're a fool.  If you have NO preference then yeah, go
with the one with the most INT to start.

Group 5 out of 5 except in isolated cases. BTW halfling druids tend to be
dr00ds, so if that's your aim, that's your race.

> Cleric

> Group: 5 out of 5

The reason I bumped wizards up to 3 out of 5 is because they're no harder to
solo than clerics.

> Enchanter
> Ideal Race: High Elf

High elves are played by self-absorbed assholes.  BTW, how could grouping be
ANY less than 5 out of 5???

> Magician
> Solo: 4 out of 5
> Group: 3 out of 5

Now this group rating is just nuts as they bring to the table as much as the
wizard does, minus evac.

> Rogue
> Ideal race: Halfling

Halfling rogue.  LOL.  Grouping is 4 out of 5 because of their SERIOUS
usefulness in making corpse recoveries a hell of a lot easier, and can deal
serious damage (and evade).

> Monk
> Solo: 4/5
> Group: 3/5

Solo 4 out of 5 at level 50?  Maybe at 30.
Group 3 out of 5?  When monks are THE best pullers in the game, overall?
