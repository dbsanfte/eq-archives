No, he didn't.  Read the post we're discussing.  Remington based this post
on the fact that Faned omitted a statement that the scammer kept the
platinum from the original post.  Most likely since he figured it was
understood.

This is not a part of the post in question.

It's also not something I'm going to discuss with you. There is no support
for your position either, until a case makes it to court, and your DT style
arguing ("It's obvious SOE owns the plat, you must be a fucking moron if you
don't agree.") is not worth wasting my time on.
