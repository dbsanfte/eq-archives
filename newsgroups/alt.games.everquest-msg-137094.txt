 I have about 54 alt levels at the moment. The reason I didn't think CM
was worthwhile is because it would also cost me 3 points for First Aid.
At the time I was pushing for my third title, so didn't want to spend
the points on something that didn't help that. Now that I have that
though I'll probably go back and train FA since I can probably get 3 alt
levels on one (long) day.

 Natural Durability, for one. That's about 300 more HP. Ambi is done. I
would like to do Purify Body sometime soon. It would be nice for those
mos that leave you with annoying dots. It's not a high priority skill
for me, but one that has it's uses. Basically I found the Archetype
skills much more useful than most of the Class abilities.
