> Whoring is a valuable service, too.

Yes, and if a woman chooses to sell her body it's pretty shitty, not to
mention equivalent to rape, not to pay her.  You probably don't have much
respect for whores, and I don't know that I blame you, but if you provide a
service and it's understood you expect payment, I don't care whether you
think the service is worth money or not, the recipient of the service should
pay or not take the service to begin with.  Nobody's forcing people to buy
ports.  If they're not willing to pay then they should make the trip the
hard way unless they know someone who is willing to do it for free.
