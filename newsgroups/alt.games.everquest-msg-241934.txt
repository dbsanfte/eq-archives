Maybe I can help you out a bit here.

Allthough Druids can serve as a main healer (this is entirely dependent 
on group composition, level, and the mobs your are fighting), Normally 
your job is to snare, dot, nuke, buff (most of your buffs are really not 
needed if a shaman is present, but buffs like DS's are always in 
demand), evacing, and back up heal. 

Always keep some available mana to help out the cleric in times of 
crisis. Also, topping off the health of your group mates between pulls 
can help out the cleric tremendously.

Never snare before the tank has firm aggro (my rule of thumb is that the 
mob's health is down my 20%), as snare tends to make the mob quite mad 
:) Also, don't sit down right after either, allow a few moments for your 
hate to diminish a bit.

Druids, as you know, have some very nice dots at later levels, use them, 
but be smart about it. They also generate a lot of hate.

The touchiest job we may have to do is evacing the group when the shit 
hits the fan. Evac too soon, and you have a mad group. Evac too late, 
you have a dead group. This is usually a learning experience that you 
gain after grouping for a while. So you may have to get a few tongue 
lashings from your group now and again :)

Basically it comes down to watching the group, and learning what its 
needs are. Druids can do alot of things, so percieving what is actually 
needed in a group is very important.

If I have missed anything, I am sure I will be corrected :)

Hope this helps.
