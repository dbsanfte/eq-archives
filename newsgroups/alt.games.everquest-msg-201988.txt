 That's not a zone out. At least not how I was defining it so I don't
bother mentioning it. Unless there's something else other than going to
Ssra.

 Loam is random from what I've seen. It would be nice it they maybe
added a few named somewhere that would drop a nice item or two. They
could probably lower the density or aggro range in the city. It's real
easy to get 4-5 mobs. And with the fast respawn you have to hurry.

 They could also make the key more readily available to everyone. Or
remove the dumb rocks in the way.

 Oh and while they're at it they could remove the anti-FD code they
added to the mobs. As in the immediately go back to their spawn points
when someone FDs.Nothing a SK can't work around but still an annoying
feature.
