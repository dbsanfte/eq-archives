I would wouldnt expect too much trouble Blackburrow will the the toughest
part if you get a map prior you should have any problem or ask for an escort
through. Qeynos Hills and Qeynos are both Newbie zones. But as far as
Blacksmithing I would try Qeynos first. The people in Erudin dont like
outsiders much you won't be KOS or anything.
