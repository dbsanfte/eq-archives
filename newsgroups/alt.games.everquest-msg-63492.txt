This is an FYI in case anyone has problems upgrading.  I downloaded the file
and ran it.  When I got to the message about Searching for upgraded
components, this may take a few minutes (or something close to that) it
wouldn't come back.  Ctrl-Alt-Del.  I retried, same thing.  Checked
microsoft and found a fix.

Go to your \windows\inf directory.  There may be oem*.inf files, ex.
oem9999.inf, with a filesize of 0 bytes.

Sort by file size and delete these files (just the ones that started with
oem and are 0 bytes in length).  I had over 22,000 of them.  I have no idea
where they come from but they all had dates from before I got my computer.
A year before I got my computer.  I don't think my cpu has been out that
long.  Anyway, after I deleted them Direct X 8.1 installed just fine.

Good luck and happy gaming,

Lewis
