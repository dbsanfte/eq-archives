I believe the term "toon" was carried over from Sierra's old online game The
Realm (it appears as though this has gone to another development house,
now). In that game you created your avatar that had a hand-drawn, 2d look to
him. Since the characters were basically cartoon characters, people took to
calling them toons.

I've played quite a few online games, and toon online really came into
prominence after that. I used to ask people where they got it from when I
would see them use it, and invariably it came from The Realm.

Not sure if that's where the EQ guys are deriving the term from (although it
would account for the low penetration into the vernacular).
