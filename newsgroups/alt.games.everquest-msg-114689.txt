If you look at your stats when drinking, you will observe that while your
Wis and Int go down, your melee stats actually -rise-.  If your AT is
high, you can gain significant melee prowess by keeping yourself
lightly intoxicated indefinately.  While this is  of little practical benefit
to a healer or caster, and even of questionable use to a hybrid who
relies heavily on his casting abilities, to a warrior, rogue, or monk who
have no use at all for their wis/int stats, inebriation can actually be
a virtue.

And one that Brell endorses heavily
