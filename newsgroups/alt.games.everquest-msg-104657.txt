As a cleric, I see death up close and personal all the time, mine, party
members, raid members, guild mates, strangers giving me a tell out
of desperation... we have a close working relationship and next time
is Death's turn to buy the ale.

Higher the level, the more likely the player is to take death in stride,
whether
because they'd have quit long since if it bothered them, or because to
-not- die they'd have to fight stuff so easy that they'd not keep up the exp
rate needed to level up that high...

Just last night, I was grouped with someone who nearly had a cow when
she realized my Rez was only 90%... I'm still 4 yellow shy of the 96%
version, but its rare that anyone complains about it in a party I'm in, most
(far more than at level 50, say) are happy to see a quick rez and some
organized efforts to get things moving along ASAP after a death or a wipe.

Death is not inevitable post 50, but its harder and harder to avoid and
still see any worthwhile exp or loot... and for some classes it really
becomes a liability to worry about such things.  A monk who isn't
blase about death just isn't worth having as a puller, because FD
-isn't- perfect and training the raid -isn't- acceptable... some mobs
are -going- to get lucky and your main concern should be dying in
a recoverable spot, not getting out alive.

The "dies a lot" class that -should- be doing all it can not to is the
chanter... because the only thing worse than a dead cleric is a dead
enchanter when the mobs are swirling thick around you.  The best
enchanters, like the best clerics, understand when its important to
let someone else die rather than get aggro themselves, since their
death may mean a wipeout rather than an isolated single body rez.
Cleric death is also high on the "try to avoid" list because thats the
one party member who won't be so easy to recover... everyone
else is only a rez and wait for effects to wear off away!
