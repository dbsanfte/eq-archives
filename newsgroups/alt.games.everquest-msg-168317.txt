What I'd recommend doing is using the PING command to a variety of different
web address to see what sort of response time you get.
To use the ping command, run a dos command box and type PING "Address" eg
203.55.33.232 or www.google.com etc.  If you put the /t command after the
PING command and before the address, you can ping the address repeatedly to
watch how you internet connection performs overtime.

Sorry to say that you can't directly ping the EQ server that you play on,
they corrected this a fair while back to prevent DDOS attacks among other
things.

Hope that helps a little
