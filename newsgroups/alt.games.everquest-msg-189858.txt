There was a discussion on the mechanics of Taunt a while ago that would
suggest this is a bad idea.

My understanding is that Taunt, *when it succeeds*, moves you to the top
of a MOB's hate list. Taunting under these circumstances will *not* make
you popular, since the MOB will ping-pong between you and the group's MT.
