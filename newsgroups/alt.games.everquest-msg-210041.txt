Because you're actually worrying about archery DPS before you've got AM3 and
EQ.  Don't bother.  :)

Archery is good for pulling, good for softening up a target while soloing,
good for getting some shots in on a rooted mob between heals (get used to
that if you tank solo...), but it's mediocre DPS at *best* until you get the
proper toys (AA).
