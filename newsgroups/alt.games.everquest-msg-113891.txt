The video card should be ok, but within the video card properties in the
control panel you should turn off V-sync and anti-aliasing.  It's on by
default and is a hog.  If you haven't made a swap-file yet, do so.  It
should be equal to AT LEAST 1.5 times your RAM.

Give that a shot.  It should at least take some burden off your system.
