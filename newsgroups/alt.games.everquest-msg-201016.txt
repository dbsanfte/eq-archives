I won't belabor the point too much.  I have spoken (directly, as in,
face-to-face) to about 20 people on this subject in the last month.  Why?  I
belong to 3 gaming clubs in my area that have a total of over 100 members
attending get-togethers.  There are  many EQ players in these clubs, most of
whom are like me and casual gamers, but a few are hard-core powergamers.
So, I have had the luxury of judging age and preferences for myself.  Also,
in my guild we have had the discussion, though there I am just guessing at
age, but not at gaming style preferences.

I never claimed it was a sigificant sample.  I did say that it was a rather
small sample.  But, you will be skeptical, anyway.
