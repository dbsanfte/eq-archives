About 1 stone in weight. They are functionally equivalent beyond that.

The Combine stuff is typically 2% better effect than the other
store-bought instruments. Not a huge difference, but if you have the
money to spare, worth it in my book.

Yes. It reduces aggro range of the target so that you can pull from
near them with relative safety (within reason, of course :).

I would highly recommend http://www.EQDiva.com as a resourse for loads
of bardic info.
