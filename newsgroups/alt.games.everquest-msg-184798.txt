Dropping traders out of the Bazaar keeps people paying monthly fees
longer? That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard. Back your bullshit
fairy tales up or shut the fuck up. Everyone would be jumping on me to

or admit you're talking out of your ass (not that anyone can really
tell the difference).
