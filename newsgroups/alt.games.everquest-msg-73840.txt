And find a healer that knows how to heal...I have played many clerics (get
bored, delete, start over another race--long story hehe), a couple paladins,
a couple druids, etc.  I always feel it is my job to keep tanks above 50%,
even 75% when practical without having to be told "please heal me"...when I
think mana is starting to become an issue to prevent this I announce in
group, in all caps, so there is no question the heals are going to come
further apart.  Of course, as I get higher, and the healing spells heal
more, I let the damage level of the tank increase before healing..matching
health to hp's.  Your healers should always know how many HPs you have as
the tank so they can estimate how many HPs you are down based on your
health...then they can best keep you alive.  I have seen waayyyy too many
clerics who think their primary job is to nuke and melee, then scream OOM
when they are need most.  A good cleric is always sitting on his/her butt
medding until full, and then join the fray...unless they are sure they are
GTG with mana for healing....then again, I have been playing EQ since day
one, so I've had the opportunity to learn all these things over time...if
you have a new healer...educate them...I have learned many folks are doing
their best, they just haven't learned the right tactics for their class
yet...
