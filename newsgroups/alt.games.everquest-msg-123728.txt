Not sure that was a bug... you might have fallen for a cheap Enchanter trick

Drop a single gold coin, cast Minor Illusion and you'll turn into another
coin (because it's the closest object) and retrieve your own gp... laugh at
newbies trying to pick you up :o)

Shame they nerfed that one.

It might have been a bug I've not heard about before... but sneaky
Enchanters can't be ruled out.
