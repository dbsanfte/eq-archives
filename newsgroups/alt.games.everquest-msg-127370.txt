}So, I've got to ask, how are you so knowledgable about Islamic education?

Directly, I know squat, beyond what little I've gleaned from friends and a 
bit of internet searching.  But I know a fair bit about Islam from back in 
religious studies class, and I know a fair bit about Mediterranean 
history, admittedly more about the north shore than the south or east.  
From that, it's not too hard to guess that Islamic nations are not likely 
to develop as a whole into the backwater third-world nations they would 
have to be to have an educational system as miserable as you suggested.

}It seems obvious to me, that anything you say about such a large section of
}people is not always going to be true, nor will it always be false (within
}reason).

And this was another major part of my point...

}For you to get on your soapbox and proclaim that, yes, there are
}Islamic schools or schools in certain Islamic nations that work, seems to be
}a little foolish.  Maybe you want to confirm that the sky is indeed blue
}while you're up there.  Likewise, not all American schools work (gasp,
}shock, amazement).  I figured it was understood that those statements
}weren't universal.  Guess I was wrong.

However -you- got on your soapbox and proclaimed that "The people of 
islamic nations are also brainwashed to believe that we will destroy 
them", and follow it up two posts later with "They haven't been taught 
western notions of reason and logic.  There is no socratic method in their 
education.  Can you blame them for believing the only thing they can 
hear?"

Perhaps you'd like to tell me which part of that is not a broad 
generalization of a humongous group of people?  Not to mention rather 
bigoted?

This is the entire reason I'm bothering to argue with you about it.  If 
you wanted to make that "There are some people in certain Islamic 
nations", I'd be inclined to agree.
