  We're about the same. VT would be nice but probably something that can
be skipped and still not make PoP impossible. VT will be similar to
others VP I think. We went to VP but most everyone else skipped it on
our server. VP geared people weren't needed for Velious ubers so I hope
VT geared people aren't what's needed for PoP.

 I agree there should be progression in EQ, but with lame time sinks
like two keys for one zone (Emp/VT) it's no wonder a lot of people don't
want to do it. Verant really needs to reconsider things like that. If
PoP is all about the timesinks I doubt I'll be playing EQ much longer.
