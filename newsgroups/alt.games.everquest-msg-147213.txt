If you had 3 groups from the same guild all chain pulling in FG for
example? If there's a modifier, and they all know that they're carrying
their weight, why not join a 'raid' and get a multiplier on it?

Not saying it would happen, nor saying it would happen enough to become
a problem, just that it's a possible abuse. If I can see it, VI can
probably see it, and would take steps to make sure the 'raid exp'
mechanism was used 'as intended'
