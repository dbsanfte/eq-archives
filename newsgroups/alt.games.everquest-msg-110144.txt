Spamming 5 line auctions is the second fastest way to get on my ignore
list when I am reading the auction channel or in EC. The fastest way
is to spam the same line a dozen times or so. Some people decided
their auctions were important enough to spam with last night, and some
others decided they wouldn't be upstaged by the spammers. I ended up
with half a dozen names on /ignore in the space of a few minutes.
