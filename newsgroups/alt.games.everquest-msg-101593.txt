You didn't put enough points into Wisdom.  Wood Elf druids can
boost their starting Wis to 115; it looks like you put 15 in Str
and 15 in Wis, (your Dex is probably only 80).  This is not a
fatal mistake, so you won't need to start over, but you will need
to get some items that raise mana, and later on swap them for items
that raise Wisdom.  At the highest levels, druids use magic almost
exclusively, and more Wisdom = more mana = a tougher druid.

As you have observed, druids become worse and worse at melee as they
gain levels.  Hence the need for more mana (Wisdom).  Druids do far
more damage with magic than they ever do with melee.  That's just the
way the class is designed, so get used to it.  Your druid will *never*
be able to hit things with a weapon as well as a true melee class could.

Melee damage is related to weapon skills, and druids, as well as the
other priest classes, (and the caster classes)  have lower level caps
on weapon skills.  For example:  at level 10 a warrior's weapon skill
caps are 55, while a druid's would be only 44, and a caster's only 33.
At level 20 the warrior would have caps at 105 and the druid only 64.
This gap just keeps getting wider as you level up; and the mobs just
keep getting harder.  You will still be able to hit things, but not
with any consistency.
