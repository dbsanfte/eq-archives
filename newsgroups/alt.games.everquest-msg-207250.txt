Not necessarily. My other BP has exactly the same AC (12) and gives me a +3
str and +3 cha. The DR tunic does offer more resistance to magic and I think
fire and cold. Given that the AC is equal and I would consider the modifiers
to be a wash, they are pretty much equal in value to me (the BP is a no drop
item while the tunic is sold by vendors for 270pp).  But the other BP was
part of my newbie armor quest. I spent a lot of blood,sweat and tears
earning that piece. The first night I went past the zone entrance to CB, I
was killed five times. Towards the end it was less exciting, killing dozens
of slavers over a five day period looking for an orc fibula. Don't get me
wrong, I don't think of the DR tunic as a throwaway item. I did say I
thought it saved my butt against the ogre mage. But to me it a lot less
valuable than the other BP just because of the time and effort I put into
acquiring it.
