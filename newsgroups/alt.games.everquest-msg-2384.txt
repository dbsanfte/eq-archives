Oops, may have to disagree.

455 LeSabre >? naaa not a chance

COPO9561- Yes, but Vette would take Top end
1969 ZL-1  Ouch o rama.
1964 Tbolt - ? 10.25 off showroom , hard to beat
1966 427 SC- CSX9506 0 to 100 to 0 13.05. Wont beat that one.
1967 GT40MKII- , again no way.
1970 Skylark GS ? - yup prolly take that one.

Your Vette is very impressive. Faster then my Lil ol GT no doubt. But I
ain't done yet :-) I still think your Lancia was my favorite though.

Opps, sorry kiddo's, you guys prolly don't know what most of those RPOs
mean.

Have a Nice day !!!!!
