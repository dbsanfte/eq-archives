Sebet,
I don't know if you are a sir or not, I was just being polite. If you 
are a female, I ask you for your forgiveness.

Revelation is specific what the mark of the beast is. Lets look at Rev. 
13:16-18. And he causeth all both small and great, rich and poor, fee 
and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: 
17. And that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark, or the 
name of the beast, or the number of his name. 18. Here is wisdom. Let 
him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the 
number of a man; and his number is six hundred threescore and six.
Or in other words 666.
So you can see, you cannot just fit about anything to fit that. It will 
be on the person's forehead, or in their right hand.

If you are a Christian, how can you call Revelation irrelevant? That 
would be like saying Genesis, or Psalms, or Acts, are irrelevant. But 
yes, if you are a Christian, you should be living as one, and be 
prepared for Christ's second coming. And it may be true, some people may 
be see what they can get away with before they have to start repenting. 
And if that is the case, then they are not living in Christ, but serving 
two masters. Or trying to I should say.
As for losing the meaning of revelation, I do not agree. It's meaning is 
just as important today, as it was when it was written.

May God bless you Sebet,
Larry
