From my own experience playing one, and seeing one played in a group,
I'm of the conviction that the greatest taunting tank in the game
remains to this day the Shadowknight.  Dots, snare, debuff, self
healing, they tend to annoy mobs like nothing else I've seen... well,
aside from an overeager nuker.  I've just never considered Pallys to
have all that great a taunt capability compared to rangers, sks, and
bards.  Although, admittedly, this may be because there's so very few
of them about.
