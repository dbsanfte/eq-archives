That is a paraphrase, but a poor one.

I in no way said that "all the smart people" go to dungeons,
nor that "all" the veterans go there.

What I did say is that fighting in dungeons provides an
education that you seldom get fighting exclusively in outdoor
zones.  If it makes you feel any better, I'd say the same
thing about fighting in outdoor zones to someone who spent
his entire "life" in a dungeon.  The wider range of situations
and environments you fight in in EQ, the more well-rounded
your "education" will be.

The problem is that a lot of people find outdoor exp grinding
in some of the "easier" outdoor zones to be such a comfortable
ride to 60 that they don't bother doing anything else.  And
thus they don't learn how to do anything else, either.  Then
when they finally dip their feet underground for the first time
at 50+ because they discover there are some items they need,
they do things like the level 51 guy I watched a few days ago
run up behind the puller in the Hole to look over his shoulder...
You can get away with that in outdoor zones, but anyone who
had spent even a single level in a dungeon would have learned
the problem with that kind of move *long* ago.

>people who like playing outdoors rather than indoors in dungeons.

That wasn't my intent.  Some of my friends are "outdoorsers"
who get the cold sweats at the thought of going deep into a
dungeon and possibly getting lost, trained, or leaving a corpse
way underground somewhere.  On the other hand, they're well
aware of the limitations that places on their EQ skills, and
they wouldn't be insulted at the notion that they'd be a liability
in a dungeon group -- they're the first ones to admit it.

More power to you.  If you enjoy doing mostly outdoor zones,
fine.  But don't get bent out of shape when someone points out
that limited dungeon experience leaves a gap in your education.

I don't mean to insult them, but neither will I consider their
EQ skills to be fully rounded.

It makes them less skilled, and I stand by my statement,
because I've seen the results and had to hand-hold people
through the holes in their abilities.

  Druid:  "Hey, why isn't Harmony working in here?"

  Wizard:  "Could you come to the entrance and lead me 
     down to the Hand room?"
  Me:  "Don't you have a map?"
  Wizard:  "Well, yes, but twisty passages confuse me."

  Me:  "Stop here for a sec."
  Ranger:  "Ok."
  Me:  "See that smudge on the wall there?  That marks
     the..."
  Ranger:  *thud*
  Me:  "...spot on the floor where the hidden pit is."
  Ranger:  "Hey, where am I?"

*snort*

And you know this for a fact from your extensive play
in outdoor zones only?

In what outdoor zone did you learn to keep your group together
while moving rapidly through tight three-dimensional passageways
like in Kedge Keep?


>Extra skill/more 'smarts' to play a dungeon enchanter?  a bard?  a warrior

See above.

Also, read Jazz's response, he did a good job of making
some excellent points.
