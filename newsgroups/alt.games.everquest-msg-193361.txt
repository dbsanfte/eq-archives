You Newb.

It's the spot in a zone that the druid spells Lesser Succor, Egress, and 
Succor will take you to in a zone when cast in that zone.  It is supposed 
to be a "safe" spot where you can evacuate your group, or yourself to when 
things are going bad.  Wizards get a similar line of spells, called 
Evacuate, to take you to the same spot.
