Had something similar last night. I was sowed and ran from several orcs in
Oasis. I zoned to nRo. The loading took longer then normal and when it was
finally done I was staring at some green stuff. I first thought wtf? then
turned around and noticed that I was all the way at the other side of nRo.

Still had my SoW so I was back fast, but it was a bit annoying.

btw. I had half health when zoning and still had half when I entered nRo.
Also my buff was still in place, so it was a genuine glich and not a "safe
spot" thingy from Verant.
