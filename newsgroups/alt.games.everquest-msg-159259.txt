So you'd be happy if you got "issued" a full set of druid wear better
than anything you can ever hope to loot, sold on vendors for a few pp?
No more dreaming of cool loot, no more thrill when something drops,
nothing unique about you versus every other druid?

Part of what makes EQ interesting, as far as I'm concerned, is the
variety and rarity of loot; upgrades to your character to work towards,
hope for, and be proud of.

Can you think of a reason why my suggestion, which would preserve the
weapon slot as an item of interest to clerics, would NOT be preferable
to the current summon plan?

Or are you just feeling bitchy and taking a cheap shot with no
substance?
