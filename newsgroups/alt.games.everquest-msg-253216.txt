And with that definition you count SK as a pet class?  If so, then why 
aren't they excited about being able to keep pet's gear and buffs, and 
heck, about not using up even more bone chips?

Druid pets are less useful than SK pets, but if they are using them for 
farming purposes I'd suppose that the retention of buffs and gear would 
still be a plus.

Clerics and wizards are the guys that aren't going to see any benefit at 
all from this, because their pets aren't persistant without enormous 
effort even in same zone, there's little chance of arranging to have the 
pet survive a zoning.

Splendid
