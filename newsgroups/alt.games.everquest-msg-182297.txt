HQ hopper hides are nowhere near as rare as bear skins, IME. It may
just be that there are more hoppers than there are bears, but I get a
lot more HQ hopper hides hunting hoppers in Shadeweavers than I get
hunting bears in Everfrost or EC/WC. Of course they're just as
_useful_ as HQ bear skins, so they should be the same price.

I suspect the drop in HQ bear skin prices (from 35-50ish pp when I
started playing just when Luclin came out to 20-30pp now[1]) came about
because hopper pelts are so common.

[1] On The Tribunal, those are the prices I've seen. The other server
I've played much on, Venril Sathir, is too new to have had pre-hopper
prices.
