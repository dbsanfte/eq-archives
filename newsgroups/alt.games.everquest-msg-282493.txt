For about an hour after the server restart, SOE has left the beta server
tradeskill vendors online in POK.  This meant that for a while all kinds of
tradeskills items were available for everyone.  Example, HQ Lion Skins for
Fleeting Quiver (tailoring), Air-Infused Spring Water (potter, brewing).
Tradeskiller paradise!  Hopefully anyone who scored skillups or a whole
bunch of valuable(expensive in Bazaar) items won't loose out with a rollback
or exploit punishment.

Well I can dream, can't I?
