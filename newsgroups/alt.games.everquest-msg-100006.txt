Here's a better situation for you. Someone auctions to *pay* for a
port to gfay, and you need the money. Will you offer to port them?

Let's assume you do. I assume given your attitude that you will ask
them if BB is okay (I ask if they want BB or SF). Has anyone *ever*
declined the port because it wasn't GFay?

I've been porting with more days /played on my druid than I care to
publicly say and *never* has anyone declined a port to BB or SF if
they wanted to go to GFay. Ever. And if anyone did, I would politely
inform them that they were being dumb. There's eight druids for every
wizard and wizards are more likely to be grouped already anyways.

This druid was acting under perfectly normal assumptions. Especially
if he wasn't capable of SF port, which many druids in ill omen won't
be.


> having to do the long, tedious and possibly 
>dangerous run from BB to GFay.

I hope you're joking. I *sure* hope you're joking....
