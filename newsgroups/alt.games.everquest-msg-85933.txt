I am changing my name to Chrysler
I am going down to Washington D.C.
I will tell some power broker
what they did for Iacocca
will be perfectly acceptable to me

I am changing my name to Chrysler
I am headed for that great receiving line
So when they hand a million grand out
I'll be standing with my hand out
Yes sir, I'll get mine


Is that the one you were thinking of Quindell?  Just the chorus here, but if
you want the rest, I'd be happy to oblige.

Time to put some Great Big Sea on I think, that should take care of any
songs in my head.
