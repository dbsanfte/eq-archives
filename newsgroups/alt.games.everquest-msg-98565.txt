A "friend of mine" *coughs* has acquired a level 55 necro account for a very
nice price and he is scratching his head where to get some practice in on
this character. I couple of things he has to keep in mind are:

    - Safety! He has been primarily a mellee and never been past 35 on a
character before, so is not going to consider getting XP for quite a while.
Practicing techniques on greens will be fine at first. No use him dying more
than necassary.

    - Impact on others. Would need to be an under utilised zone due to the
above - he does not want to affect legit leveling characters or even spawn
campers, anyone at all really.....  Seeing as he plays from opposite
timezone to US this shouldn't be too hard though.

    -Outdoor zone to start off with, without known major pathing issues at
first.

    -Soloing off course ; )

I was thinking he should start off on about high 30's to low 40 area until
spell familiarity is perfected and basic techniques are second nature. Does
this sound like a correct ball park figure?

If anyone could have some recomendations it would be much appreciated and I
would be sure to "forward them on"....  : )

BTW - the necro is Dark Elf and has all spells to 55 and average equip with
Jboots though, no AAexp tho....

Thanks
