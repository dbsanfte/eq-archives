Well I don't have any real experience with this, but it seemed to
me that quads tended to break up fairly easily, and that the
trouble inherant in sharing a quad is just that; tons of time
wasted in rounding the mobs back up tight.  If you've found that
its not really hard to keep them all on one caster or the other,
then no problem after all.  I wasn't examining wizard/druid
combination quadding, though, I imagine that would be
advantageous since you'd have better snare, better run speed (SOW
instead of JBoots/Run3), and better nukes.  Still you are
spending mana to kill, which means you don't get the same force
multiplication that melee get (where they kill faster so they
need less healing)...
