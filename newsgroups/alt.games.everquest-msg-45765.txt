Glide is for voodoo cards right? Did you ever find one? Basiclaly you
should have no glide*.* something system files in windows without a
voodoo card. Any old graphic card files can possibly screw up a new
card or old residue. It looks like from what you say your computer is
still thinking you have a voodoo card. Make sure its removed from
system devices and make sure the software is uninstalled from control
panel programs install/uninstall. Then go through and look for
glide*.* in windows or windows/system or what not and stuff them all
in some backup zip just in case then delete them.

As a last resort you might have to format/reinstall etc, but first try
to clean the old drivers out.

It should just say primary display driver, its not really LOOKING for
the card or drivers since that IS your only card for windows use and
the all around card for everything (no card only for 3d now like with
the old voodoo ones) Those drivers are already loaded when yous start
your OS, the only thing EQ is doing now is starting direct 3d or junk
and direct draw.

For instance this is from my dbg (with a tnt 16 meg agp card, the same
drivers basically as you would be using) upon getting in the game
after various init lines:
