"Applying Poison


To apply a poison you need to be level 18 and train at least one point at
your guild. I suggest you put as many points in as you can afford - the
skill is hard/expensive enough to raise. The higher skill you have applying
the poison, the faster you will be done applying it. At the start you will
need 7 seconds to put a poison on your dagger, later it is rumored to be
significantly less, but I still cannot accomplish that.

To poison a weapon you need a piercing one - they are the only ones who will
actually be possible to poison - make it stick to your mouse and click it on
the poison. You will get a "you have successfully applied the poison" or a
"you failed to apply the poison" message. In case you failed, the poison is
simply lost (WAAAAAA). If it worked, the poison will be applied to your
primary weapon space and will go off as soon as you do a piercing attack
(other than backstab). The poison attack is then checked against the poison
resist value of the opponent (means: it can be resisted). As you poison your
weapon you will sit down automatically and you have to stand up by yourself.

The poison wears off (your weapon) when:

  a.. you leave the zone
  b.. you are disconnected
  c.. you camp
You can now safe a pre-poisoned dagger for later because if you use a sword
(1hs) and switch later to piercing, the poison will get off as soon as you
land the first piercing blow. Previously you have poisoned your hand and
could not save the poison for later but now you can.Fortunately the
poisoning of a prey can no longer be interrupted - this was a bug and is
fixed now.

As you get your Apply Poison skill from the guild at level 18 you have one
great problem: Where to get poisons? For your next two levels you will have
several opportunities"

This site is a poison makers mecca, but sadly the owner is no longer
updating it =(

But as you can see its not the weapon you poison but the slot, and until you
do a piercing attack it stays "stored" and ready to be used on that slot.

http://kikyara.tripod.com/ is the home page of said site, together with
EQTraders you have a winning combination.
