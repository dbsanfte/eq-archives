My Erudite Wizard had the same problem.  When I went to Neriak, to my
surprise, the guards were dubious to me.  AFAIK, I've never killed any
"good" races to increase this faction.  So I make my way down to the place
they sell the new port spells, with my gate spell ready (I had invis on but
just in case) and scared like I've never been since my lowbie days.  Made it
there safely.  Alas, the vendors would not sell to me.  I picked out a
newbie wizzy and sent a tell asking for assistance, offering a payment at
the end.  The spells were 11pp each if I remember and I gave the newbie
enough to buy 3 at a time (offering 100pp when we are done to discourage
someone just walking away with my money).  Didn't take too long and the
newbie was 100pp richer that day.
