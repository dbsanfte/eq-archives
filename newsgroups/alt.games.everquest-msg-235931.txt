>Do I have to have a Credit Card to use the account?

No. I don't have one and I am fine - not sure about your problem, but almost
everyone has been having trouble since the new expansion pack came online...

One thing - you said you have a month - I did have to get a 90 day card
(Best Buy - $40) and register that number to get my account started

A pain, it implies you can run with the package, but I still say it is
worthwhile - if the $13 a month is a serious financial issue, then do not
play EQ - get a part-time job instead - seriously though, was not happy, but
is worth it..

PS - where did you find the details on how much time was on your account?  I
cannot find it...
