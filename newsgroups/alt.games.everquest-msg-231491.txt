Hi
I've been trying to make friends with the Shak Drathas for a while. So 
far I've got to apprehensive.

As I usually kill only if I get experience. Cave clearing is no longer 
an option in 2 of the caves as they are now green to me.

What I've found is the more high level characters you kill the more they 
swap to the other type. When I was getting experience from the other 
caves they didn't seem to change as much as now.

It also seems to be cyclical. Someone did mentioned you get more of one 
type when Norrath is in the sky over Shadeweaver. Though as my machine 
is one up from an abacus. I have the 3D sky off in Luclin due to 
unplayable lag.

Plus with a head like a sieve (I think I wrote it down somewhere!) I 
cannot remember which way round it was.

Finally  when a character getting faction went through slaughtering 
anything with Gor in the title. It wasn't until he finished the 
Warlord's cave that I saw my first cave full of low level Shak Drathas.

I hope this helps
