It probably isn't your spell choice so much as where you are hunting. My
favorite has always been Lake Rathe for soloing. There is a blip where
aviaks are starting to green out before you make 16 but it is very smooth
other then that. Something like aviaks to 16 unless you are a strong class
like necro, then Jonah Brucker who gives a 1/2 blue bubble per kill all the
way to 19. From 19 to low 20s it is aviak guards. Mix the hermit in SK above
20 if you need the pp. That takes you to 28 where spires and Paw solo or
groups is about right.

All of the aviaks(5 only levels 8-12) in front of The Arena can be pulled
solo. The two aviak guards will not assist each other but the one to the
north will pull an aviak with him. Jonah Brucker is alone so you never have
problems with pulling him. Jonah is much slower and hits softer then the
guards. The bad/good thing about this is you do ~14 levels never moving more
then 5 minutes away from the different spots.

I DOT or debuff pull, let the pet take aggression, back up, debuff/slow or
DOT, fear, kitchen sink.

I would group with any necro or enchanter who knows how and where to fear
kite with any of my characters including my necro and enchanter. A druid or
ranger snared and feared mob is almost like free experience.
