Agreed, and like I said, I'm not playing a warrior in such situations.

It's still not as messed up as some lady on our server (Firstar/Preciouss)
that tries to get guys addresses and sends them pictures, then claims that
they got her pregnant or something and tries to guilt them into giving her

Or that lady on Mithaniel Marr with the whole BDSM/ master/slave thing.

Agreed, and like I said, I don't do those things yet.

Yes, but it still isn't as difficult to get down as, say, correct CH timing.
(The off-tank part, EVERYBODY should know how to use /assist)
