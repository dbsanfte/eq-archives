I remember reading somewhere that the number can only be an integer between
3.0 and 9.0 .... 5.0 (default) being the best setting for a 28.8k modem ...
I have mine set for 6.0 on a 56k modem with no problems, I did have it set
for 7.0 but was getting disconnected during raids and other situations with
a lot of activity.
