(Rune jumps into the thread) And guess which ones I don't have? HAW HAW,
it's the legs, helm, and BP! But I don't need the Wisdom, 'tis the AC
that lures me to these... Also, our guild will be doing Hate a lot more
now, to equip those who need the armor and to get epic drops (Staff of
elemental mastery: Earth dropped tonight, so one mage 'just' needs PoA
drop to finish... 'Just'... Also got the warrior drop off the unpleasant
hand and the BP for pallys.)

Oh, and I still like the bracers. Dunno why, the stats are pretty much
useless, but, lookit, it's poiple! I'm a walking grape, wheee!

Oh, and also, I like the arms too, since I'm a weakling High elf cleric,
not a burly dor^WDWARF, SORRY, NOT THE OTHER WORD! And of course the MR,
MR is nice. Oh, and the AC.

Also also, I've never seen the stupid BP drop. It did on a couple raids
I couldn't attend, of course, sigh...

I've gotten 213 Wis without really trying... and that's with EM boots,
and resist headgear too. Still wouldn't mind more, though. Means the
jewelry can be exchanged with resist gear permanently.
