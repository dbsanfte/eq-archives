OK, so how to peeps pronounce Luclin in RL? For me, it's been Loos-lynn,
whereas a coworking pronounces it Luck-lynn.

As to the others, Mana = Man-uh. This has beena round since long before EQ.
I've never heard it pronounced any other way.

Firiona Vie = Fear-ee-oh-na V-eye to me. Not sure where I got the first
part, but the second is a common pronunciation of vie.
