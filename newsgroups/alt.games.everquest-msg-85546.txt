Fire is the only 49 one that isn't research only :)

Cornucopia can be bought in Qeynos. Everfount is the only one I, in
retrospect, needed to research. Not to mention it's made obsolete at lvl 51
with Gift of Xev, but that can be said about a lot of spells.

Mages only get direct upgrades of spells so that the lower version becomes
useless. The only 2 exceptions are the malo line for building up your debuff
and the highest level magic / fire based nuke (at lvl 55 I still use my lvl
44 SoS for fire-immune/high res critters). Neither line is researched.
