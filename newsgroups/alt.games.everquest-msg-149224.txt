Saying the swear filter is because "children play this game" is just
fucking stupid. The EULA says itself, minors cannot own accounts. If
they play they are playing on a legal adult's account therefore it
doesn't matter if they are playing, it's their parent's decision to
let them play so if people want to swear they should be able to. If
the parents don't like it, then they have the right to either deal
with it or not let their child play the game. There is a multitude of
alcoholic beverages in the game, do they censor that out because
children could get ideas? No, because this game is made for people 18
year of age or older because they are who pay the damn bills. If any
MMORPG ever has any stupid system where you get in trouble for
publicly saying any swear word at all, that is the time for that game
to be boycotted like it never existed.
