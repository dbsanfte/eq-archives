Forgot to mention that the Rodcet Nife missionary is outside the saucer
temple *_in North Qeynos_.*  (since there is no spinning saucer temple in
Halas, I thought it would go without saying.... I was trying to be brief
while half asleep...sorry about that).

When they opened the server, they did change allowable dieties for some.
Monks in Qeynos worship Veeshan instead of being agnostic, and they made
Mithaniel Marr a diety available to Barbarian Shamen and Warriors, for
example.  But I haven't heard of them changing any of the dieties available
since the server came out of Test.

I've heard the ability to switch sides was something being considered, but
not yet enabled, and thus is still only a rumor.
