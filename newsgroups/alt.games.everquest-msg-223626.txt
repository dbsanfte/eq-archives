The good news is that you don't have to go in as deep any more. The
bad news is that you can't DA dive to the bottom to bypass most of the
dungeon. I think you need a rogue (or a key drop to get to him now
though), check the quest section at the crucible, I think they have a
couple of threads by people that have done the Epic since the last
change.
