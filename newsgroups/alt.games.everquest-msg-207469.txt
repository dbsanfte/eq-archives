Warriors only need the red scale, which, thanks mostly to Ragefire and
Scalekeeper Whatshisname, is much, much more common.   The green scale we
need only drops from Sev and a VP dragon.

Paladins need a book off red and white.   Clerics do not require any dragon
drops.  Or any planar drops, for that matter.
