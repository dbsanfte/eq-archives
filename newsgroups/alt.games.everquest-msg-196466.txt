Ok, you have confirmed something I have wondered. As a bard I see these
mezzes done by casters and the animal stays there until it is awoken and
I an in aware. Might just be a case of the duck(caster) gliding across
the pond(mob) whilst the feet(spells) are fast and furios. Never having
played one, I have no idea.

As a lvl 36 bard, the only mezz I have is Pixie's (lvl 28 song), which
seems to be appropriately named, i.e. for pixies only, or of pixie
strength because it only lasts a few tics. So that confirms how it is
done, target A, cast on A, target B, cast on B, target C, cast on C,
then repeat and cross fingers that your comms link doesn't go red during
it all.

This part I seem to have undercontrol judging from comments in groups
{:-). The tricky part is guessing what the audience really wants. lol.
