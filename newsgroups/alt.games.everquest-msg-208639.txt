This must vary between MOBs. I was kiting Vektar(sp?) in Dreadlands
(lvl 60something Iksar monk NPC, spawns in the ruins directly west of
the FV tunnel) and after 15 minutes I had him down to only 96% HP when
he started summoning me.

Also, I can confirm that you do not need to do damage to a MOB in
order to get summoned. I was recently at an AoW raid. The only songs I
was twisting were my lvl 50 haste songs (because of lag, 2 is the most
I can do reliably) and I eventually got summoned when the MT went
down.
