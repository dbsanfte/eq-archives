Ok, I think I got it.  When I said new I meant new, dinged 16 last
night.  So no raids in his near future.

I've been a monk/necro/cleric until now (65-67 now) and never been a
raider.  Oh I've assisted on the random necro epic 2.0 or HoH flagging
but that's about it (cleric epic too).
In my life as such I've never really known about an MA nor apparently
needed to.  I've been re-invited to many a group and several raids
without such knowledge so I must be doing something right...

Thanks for the edumucation.
