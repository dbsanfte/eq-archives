2 damage per second.

A weapon that swings, unhasted, every 2.2 seconds,
and does on (just a rough "looks like") an average
of 20 points each hit... how do you get 2 points
of damage per second?

Either DPS does not mean what I think it means,
or Copelands or you are wrong.

If you said 10dps I'd be more inclined to believe
you, although I"m lead to believe the calculation
is more involved than that.

Other weapon is 40/38, and does a high end of
140 damage in my hands.  Lets guess average is
70, not counting misses.  So be generous, assume
real average is 40.  Again, we are flirting with
10dps... and she's winking back.

Is 10dps pathetic?  Probably.  But I just can't figure
2 dps is even accurate.

Further, I really doubt that 40/38 no proc and 20/22
100dd proc come out to precisely the same figure.
Since my original question was a comparison of
the two weapons, both of which are priest only,
any discussion of how pathetic they are relative
to melee output is beside the point,and any rounding
off in order to minimize the differences is counterproductive.

I did think of another reason Righteousness will
remain my main melee tool; MoK, which I slap on
about 90% of the mobs I fight on a day in day out
basis (ones I melee anyway, if they don't live long
enough for me to melee I'm not MoKing them
either) functions based on hit count, so I'm providing
myself with a significantly better melee-based
regen rate with the 20/22.

At the same time, on a mob where I can't stick
MoK and there is a DS operating (DS removal
being one of MoK's best functions) then the
40/38 cudgel would be better... although I probably
would desist from meleeing at all with a DS
operational, this would take melee from fun
and making a small contribution to the fight,
to wasting my mana healing myself.
