Okay, for enchanters, there is a great site, Xornn's Guide to
Enchanting, at:

http://members.tripod.com/xornn/

It doesn't have a message board (you can go to
http://eq.castersrealm.com/ for that), but it is a really good site
about learning how to play an enchanter.

For magicians, there's this site:

http://www.magecompendium.com

That DOES have a message board.

For clerics, go to this site:

http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/

That also has a message board

Of course, http://eq.castersrealm.com also has guides and strategies
for all classes.
