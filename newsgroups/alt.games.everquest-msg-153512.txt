Didn't somebody post that there is a Curse that reduces the
effectiveness of heals that land on the cursed target?  And
people are gonna be able to get their buffed HP well over 8k
with Pop, I'll bet.  And perhaps there're be more mobs with
the heal mitigation curse or other similar effects in PoP.
I'm thinking the effect will be that you'll be very happy to
have some Druids and Shamans with their "Incomplete" Heals
along to shore things up when the going gets tough.  As you
say, it won't have much effect on current characters dealing
with current content, but they've been playtesting PoP for
a while and this sounds like they're laying the groundwork
for the release.

It'll make it harder for a relatively small group of top end chars
to take on the toughest content, but will it really "hurt"?  or
will it just mean that even at the very top people will have to
gather a sizable force to take on the toughest bosses?

I haven't seen it in game (not up near enough the top I guess) but
I've seen plenty of bitching by Warriors, not to mention Martin's
little boast about tanking an entire HoT raid with his Monk and
having zero deaths in the raid force when he did it.  And then
there're Bergh's comments that it's lots easier on the mana to
keep a Monk MT healthy than a Warrior when xp grinding, and you
get the added benefit of the mobs dying faster to the Monk's much
higher damage output.  Of course, it being Verant, they'll no
doubt manage to make it so that the "uber" Monks will still be
better tanks than Warriors against most mobs, while those who
have only recently started to get some "uber" gear will suddenly
be set back where they were a couple months ago.

Kaev <--- no, I'm not a cynic, why do you ask?   :-p
