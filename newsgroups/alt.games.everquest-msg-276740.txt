Sure, hockey is a competition, with equipment that's severely limited.  Kinda
irrelevant.  If you take a more open-ended activity with a wide range of
equipment available (say, scuba diving or airplane flying, or even a
competitive sport like sailboat racing), you'll find that the rich lawyer
can indeed play alongside those who spend much more time than he.

>Set your priorities and live with them.

Umm, agreed.  Many people prioritize the game below other time-consuming
activities, but still want to play with good equipment and high-level
characters.

Heh.  Very strong argument there.

>*You* want to experience the endgame without actually playing to get there.

Without playing as much as some have, yup.  Different priorities as you say.

>That's not how games work.

It's clearly how EQ works, for people buying or selling chars and equipment.
EQ may not be a "game", by your definition.  Whatever.
