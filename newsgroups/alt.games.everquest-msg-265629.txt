What coal problems?

You log on, blow away your temporary character, start a new one.  Go to the
island, do the first quest, sell your gloves, buy 15-20 coal (depending on
char class), dump 'em in the bank, log off.  Repeat as many times as needed
for more coal, candles, et cetera.

Log back on with your main character, use supplies.

(I keep one character slot available for testing starting-character things,
such as the bugs on the boat.  Very useful when you need to pick things up
from the Island of Refuge, too.)
