But I'm not hung up on it <smile>.  You are <grin>.   I enjoy the game
regardless of your declaration of its stage of development.  You entered
into a thread which began by comparing the merits of one game to another,
then in your initial post you made a comparison yourself and then professed
to not give a shit if one was better than the other and became offended at
my comparison, which makes you a hipocrit, though I don't think you intend
to be a hypocrit.  I just think you are very silly <smile>.  You are also
defensive, argumentative, and not very mature <smile>.  Your maturity level
tends to bring me down to a level at which I do not enjoy conversing or
debating.  Therefore are a waste of my time and so I'm kill filing you.

<smile>
