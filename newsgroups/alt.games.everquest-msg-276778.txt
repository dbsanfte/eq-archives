Dual-core CPU's.  Chip manufacturers have pretty much hit the physical
limitations modern die manufacturing will allow, so now we're getting
multiple CPU's on a single chip die.

Also, dual-CPU did previously catch on, in a big way, just not in the
home market.

Xiphos - So, essentially, a dual-CPU with two dual-core proccessors
would be a quad-cpu system.  Man, that'd be sweet.
