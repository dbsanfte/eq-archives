Take a look at your post-50 single target buffs. "Allowable Targets:
All." My regrowth can be cast on all, while my (hopefully future)
protection of the glades can be cast on 41. It has nothing to do with
level of target.

Now, here's something interesting: ports and evacs have Full group as
allowable targets, but the spell Succor and the advanced skill Exodus
(Succor skill, listed as a level 1 spell) have 41...

True, 41 might have another meaning entirely or no meaning at all, but
I find it intriguing that introzone evacs are being treated the same
way as group buffs.
