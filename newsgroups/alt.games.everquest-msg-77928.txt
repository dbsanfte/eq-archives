Actually, that sort of gave me an idea for an NPC trainer dummy... If
you gave, say, 100pp to one of the Warrior guild trainers, he could
spawn a lvl 60 mob with Sleeper-level hit points, 0 AC, hits for 1/1
*and* casts Heal on the target. It despawns after, say, ten minutes.
Perfect mob for getting all skills plus Defence up. This may be against
the Vision, but I find it slightly unfair that casters can get their
skills up with no risk, by targeting corpses (or even themselves, for
particularly masochistic types), and yet melees have to risk getting
chewed up to get their skill-ups.
