On the face of it, this looks like nonsense, spouted just to be contradictory.

However, there are a couple ways it could be correct.

1) people who powerlevel are most often doing so with a second or third
character.  They've already learned many of the EQ lessons, so whether
they powerleveled or not, they'd be better overall gamers than most real
newbies.

2) people who powerlevel are doing so with the help of a higher level
buddy, if that buddy takes the time to explain how things work, its
possible that the PL'd gain a better understanding of the game in
less time than a non-PL'd newb

3) Verant teaches us some wrong things at low levels; everyone makes
a decent tank, pets are high damage producers but fragile, we can
never outrun a mob, death costs very little exp, mana regens real fast
so we might as well use it all up... perhaps by skipping up to level
30 or so quickly, -then- learning how things work, we'd not get some
of that stupid stuff stuck in our heads and have to unlearn it.

All in all, though, I think there are good lessons to learn at lower
levels, in fact best learned at those levels while screwing up
doesn't cost anyone much exp or time.  How many level 40's
have you seen that don't know not to attack mez'd mobs?   How
many high level tanks don't get "rooted the add, move back?"
I've always assumed that these are either PL victims or EBay
purchases... can't imagine gettting to level 40 the hard way
without having had little things like this drummed into your head.

Also, you reveal your bias; large scale battles.  Yes, there's not
a lot of tactical energy expended in a raid, and what there is
of it consists mostly of following orders.  Its a three man group
that will put you front and center tactically, where you really
have to contribute the best your class is capable of, and make
it work with the other two classes you have available this time,
in this situation against this combination of mobs.

Which would you rather have at your back when the chips
are down, someone who knows when to root, when to
kite, when to heal, what to DOT, when a nuke is called for..
or Joe "flame lick the mob and then melee it when it comes
in close, the DS will kill it for you and you'll get the exp."
