So? It doesn't "mirror reality within reason" lacking those things.

I NEVER DISAGREED WITH THAT POINT! Jesus, boy, do you always try to

The fact there are so many grandmaster <tradeskill>ers out there seems
to imply that a lot of people get SOME enjoyment out of it, otherwise,
why do they bother?

Because thinking the system isn't a perfect representation of the real
equivalent does NOT mean I think it's broken. A perfect representation
or even a close one would be even LESS enjoyable than the current
system.
