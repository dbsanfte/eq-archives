IMO, it's this type of encounter ... high-end content ... that KEI was
designed for.  I don't have a single issue with this.

KEI wasn't designed for use on a characters in their 20's, 30's, or even
40's.  It makes encounters at that level severely unbalanced.  This is
what's broken, and this is what needs to be fixed.

Does this need to be changed?  Most definitely.  Will it be changed?  Sadly,
I don't think anyone at SOE has the balls to do it.
