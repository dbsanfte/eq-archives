Something that people forget when discussing sustained DPS is the
"opportunity cost" of that nuke.  (probably mis-using the term).
What I mean is, when I stand to cast a nuke, I lose at least 1 tick
of med time, and on longer nukes, 2.  That's an additional cost
of 25-50mana on each nuke.  Given that, even R-Click nukes are not
free by any means.  BoBC have a 18sec cast time - that's 3 ticks
or 75mana lost (for 600 dam, granted).

Because every XP group has a 'chanter?  BS.  Most of my XP fighting
is done sans Clarity.

It's interesting to compare the 2 damage (int) casters.  Wizards are
a bit weak in sustained DPS (needed for most pickup XP groups) and 
excellent in raid situations - Mages have good sustained DPS, with
some burn down ability, but due to pet restrictions aren't as good
a raiding class as they'd like to be.  Waters at VI has indicated that
they are looking at ways to help pets hit high level mobs, which will
help a bit.  They also need to find a way to help wizards do sustained
DPS in XP groups.

Yep, had a guild Wizzie (50th) in our group yesteday in the entry to the
Hole.  We pull the top 11 mobs in about 10 minutes, then pull the locked
room across the bridge, or the CY, for the next 10-11min before the 6
warriors at the entry re-pop.  We got to the rock golem on the bridge, 
and the wiz say "OOM".  Um, this guy is what you HOLD your mana for, he
is what we need a burn down on.  We also need burn down when we pull the
locked door, as we get 2min, usually 3, and the rock golem from there 
needs to go down fast.  In order to do that when we are pulling fast
though, the wiz has got to suck it up, and not nuke on many encounters.
This is why they, and many PU group leaders, think they are weak in XP
groups - they have to sit and watch entire fights without nuking.  When
I do the same thing, Spike is in there slashing and backstabbing away,
and there is a steady stream of "xxxx was burned" messages showing my
constant contribution to damage output.  This is why I think many mages
need to stop whining, and Wizards need *something* to help out.
