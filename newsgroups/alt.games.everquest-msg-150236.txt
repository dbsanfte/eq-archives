I don't think it's an issue of being ignored. If it was being ignored,
you'd NEVER get your stuff back. More like a lotta people having the
problem and a limited force to deal with it. Restoring lost gear does
require checking logs to see what you did have. *shrug* And
considering this issue isn't by far the only thing they have to do...

Slow response time is bad, yes. But to say that you're being ignored
because it's not dealt with as fast as you'd like is being an ass. 

I remember when doing tech support for DirecTV, we had a problem where
a certain receiver model suddenly started killing access cards. We had
no clue why. Even new ones we sent out would get zapped after a couple
days. We finally worked it out, but in the meantime, we had irate
customers demanding that we get off our asses and fix the problem and
how they were being ignored because they had to sit on hold for
forever before they could talk to someone. Yeah, that's right, we LIKE
being cussed out by every other customer that calls.... And the high
call volume is just paradise.

Point is, lack of immediate results isn't indicating the problem is
being ignored...
