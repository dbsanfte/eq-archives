I was asked... actually sort of interviewed via email.  On the other
hand, I don't see how I could have objected if they'd used anything
I posted here in the newsgroup, which is after all a public forum.

While overall the article is a pedestrian rehash of old issues, the
paragraph

"This problem of too many players and not
               enough for them to do could strike other online
               game worlds. "

is a logical disconnect.  RF (and other bottleneck spawns) are
not a case of "too many players and not enough of them to do"
but one of "too many players who all want to do one specific
thing, and that thing happening too rarely"

There's plenty of other things to do in EQ.
