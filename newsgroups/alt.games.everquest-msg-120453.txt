LOL, get used to patch days.  I have, I'm almost to my one year anniversary.
Patch day is a good time to do all that research you've been neglecting.
Get a list of things you wanna look up and go through allakhazam and
eqtraders and lokari.net.  That'll keep you busy.  You can print out maps
without it interfering with play time, I hated when I first started, I kept
getting lost and having to log and print out the map for where I was.
Eqatlas.com/atlas is where you'll find the maps.

Get ready for Planes of Power, when that comes out patchday may end up being
Patch week.  They can't get an expansion up and running the first time ever.

There are a couple of chat rooms that you can check out  eq.castersrealm.com
has a link to the one they host.  If you use IRC you can get in the
castersrealm one by following the instructions on the website.  Usually the
chatrooms are flooded on patch day, empty any other time.

Have Fun
