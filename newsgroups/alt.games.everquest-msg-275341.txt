You're just a whiney little bitch, aren't you?  Yeah, I insultued you then, 
and I'm doing it now.  Yes, I'm being harsh.  You know what, it's the only 
way I've been able to get you to say anything concrete.  At least now, 
you've finally given an example.  And, you know what, the world didn't end!

Now, between when I wrote that and when I said that all I am doing is 
calling on you to explain yourself, seven posts had gone by, and all I -was- 
doing at that point is calling on you to explain yourself.  That doesn't 
mean that's all I -had- been doing previously.  But you spent three posts in 
that branch, alone, twisting and dancing around.  So I called you on it. 
And this is the best you can respond with?  Instead of actually answering to 
the accusation, you accuse me of lying (which I've just shown to not be the 
case, had I said something to the effect of "all I've been doing is calling 
on you to explain yourself, you would have a case).  But, hey, as I said 
above, at least you can give me a concrete example of how you're wrong, 
which is a start.

> Brash lie duly exposed.

Your own?

> Embarrassing, isn't it?

You tell me.
