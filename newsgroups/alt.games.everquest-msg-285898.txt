  If he is not actively using tactics to avoid or sabotage killfiles
  (posting from various systems, forging, massive crossposting to create
  cross-newsgroup flame wars) then it should be quite easy to killfile
  him. =20

  It does seem that the frequency and the size of his posts are
  approaching net abuse.  However, IMHO, they aren't quite there yet. If
  his postmaster were to act in this instance, it would raise troubling
  censorship issues.
