You probably did nothing wrong, it's probably EQ, I haven't had good luck
running in DX8 either, but have not seen that problem....And in real world,
if they're floating, I'd say that's Z-axis shift...But since someone at some
point at Verant said "Screw that Cartes guy, we're gonna make are own
coordinate system" it could be y-axis....hehe....
