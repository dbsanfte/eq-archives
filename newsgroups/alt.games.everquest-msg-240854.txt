That's true; was just meant as an example of how bad things can get if
aggro is lost. Our MT lost Mith Marr later on in the fight once (this
was warrior tanked), and he waxed half the wizards and rangers in the
raid before aggro was taken back. VZ (from RZ script, not the normal
version) got into the clerics sometimes when we were still learning
him, and there's not much you can do to help cleric aggro other than
have more clerics. You want to rely on built aggro, not taunting aggro
back.

Okay I have to admit I have an unusual viewpoint on this because on
test I got to do GEC (and XtC for Hategiver) probably a lot more than
a prod guild would (due to the lack of competition for them). Our
guild tanks all have some combo of two EB weapons now, and two have
BoW. But I understand that may not be possible on prod servers, in
which case an Anger III augmented NToV weapon probably suffices.
