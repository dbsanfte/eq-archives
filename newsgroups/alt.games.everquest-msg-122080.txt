Sorry, but that "name" is quite a stretch.  Historicly, names that
"say something" are typically descriptive epithets either bestowed
by others or claimed by the individual and subsequently accepted by
others.  "Didju Evah" is in no way descriptive, nor was it accepted.

Bards historicly are the keepers of the knowledge of law (or custom if
you prefer) and history, a very serious responsibility.  They did so
with verse because their society had no written language and verse
can be remembered more accurately (and ballads were history, their
entertainment value was secondary).
