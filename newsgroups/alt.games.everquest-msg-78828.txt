I hate being asked for a SoW as my druid (or shaman for that matter) but
when I am any other class, I'd kill for one. I generally only ask if I am
desperate. (Running Paineel to Overthere is one of those moments) But I am
ALWAYS, ALWAYS polite, to the point in being terrified to ask a druid or
shaman (or ranger) for SoW. I know what they are thinking: " Not another
one... *SIGH*". If I can, I will throw some buffs their way as a thank you,
though at level 18 I don't have a lot. (It is the thought that counts)

As my druid I will generally SoW people. It takes near to no mana, and it
makes everyone's lives easier. (They don't have to ask, I don't have to feel
guilty/annoyed/etc) Though at level 21, as you say, your SoW costs a lot of
mana, and it is best saved for your group. They should realise that, if they
don't then just ignore them.

Solitude :o)
