What are serious consequences on an international scale?  Send Saddam to his
room?

You may want to reread paragraphs 8 and 9 of the resolution.  Iraq has not
complied by any reasonable reading.  They have always had conditions
attached to any compliance and they have failed to provide a full
declaration within 15 days (they still haven't) of their weapons programs.
These alone should have caused "serious consequences" years ago.

I still think Bush failed the diplomacy on the subject and is acting like a
cowboy.
