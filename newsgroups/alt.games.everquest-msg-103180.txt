 Note that nothing has been taken away from old school rangers, but see how
mad as hell they are still? For a lot of people EQ is nothing more than a
huge pissing contest and nothing will infuriate them more than to find out a
change has been made and as a result their carefully crafted "optimum"
characters have been bettered somehow.

Just look at all the people whinging that Luclin destroyed the economy...
yet from a Joe Average point of view it has just made some nice - but now
"so last year" to the pissing contest crowd - gear become affordable and
more readily availiable.


Look at the vocal resistance that erupted over the new changes to the lower
end of the game? The most common theme was "Hey, it was a pain in the ass
for me so it should be for everyone else too". But again, for those who just
play the game to have fun and distance themselves from 'The Pissing
Contest", it either did not affect them at all or was a welcome change.

I have come accross 4 seperate 50+ characters in the Netherbian Lair
complaining over the Netherbian Chitin breastplate (as they camp it no less)
and how it was "too good an item to be availiable to sub 30's" and
unbalancing. Note that this is not just pure snobbery either - they did have
a point... of a sorts. Making items availiable at a level where it is
actually likely to be used cuts the player merchants out of the equation. A
boon to many, a minor annoyance to some, but a crippling blow to the Greater
Fay Farmers federation. Oh Boo F'ing Hoo eh?
