Being able to be self sufficient by putting in the time from day 1 on
EQ is pretty neat.  When I started playing I had no idea of the
usefulness of the trade skills or the demand for things I sold for
coppers to the merchants.  But shortly I discovered things like
spiderling silks and bone chips could earn you platinium quicker than
trying to solo all day long.

I have to say the player based economy is much more interesting, both
as a buyer and seller.  I like the fact that newbies can start the
ball rolling quickly.  I like being able to see competition on the
items I'm looking to buy, compared to buying a steel longsword for 11p
from every merchant in every city.
