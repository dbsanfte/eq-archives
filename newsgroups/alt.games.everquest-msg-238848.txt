if you're going to play up to 50-55, enchanter and mage would be best IMO
(solo or grouped)

if you're going to play to 60-65, enchanter and wizard is best for
grouping-- 2boxing a cleric and an enchanter can be a LOT of work
sometimes....65 wiz is generally a lot more useful than 65 mage, especially
as a bot

and to throw a monkey wrench in your whole plan . . .if you like the mage
for his pet, consider a beastlord for his superior pet + superior utility =)
