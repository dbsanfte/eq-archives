Not sure it qualifies as "chasing a carrot" if a person continues to be
entertained. "Chasing the carrot" would imply a desire to achieve some
end result. I don't know that the typical EQ player views the game that
way.

I would probably agree with that.

Well, there *is* the option of making some *new* friends. ;)

Possibly. I know I've resorted to 2-boxing (can't justify more
subscriptions than that, though I do enjoy it enough). I'm pretty much
just getting a different kind of value from it these days. Not
necessarily less, just different.

I'm kinda looking forward to seeing it, myself.

Yeah, that was kinda my reaction as well. As far as I knew, Rashere's
claim to fame was his appearance in the first tutorial. :P

I don't mean to instigate, but maybe it's just your outlook on it. I got
just as miffed with SoE as the next guy at one point, but here I am
again. I'm a MMORPG junkie, and, at least until Vanguard is released, EQ
is still the best one out there. I still get my money's worth from it.
Different strokes I guess.
