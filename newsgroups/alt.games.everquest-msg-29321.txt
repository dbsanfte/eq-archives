Clerics of level 39 and above can do this. At higher levels they can
ressurect you with some return of the experience that you lost when you
died. Bear in mind that them ressurecting you takes time and effort and so
its not something that a total stranger will go out of their way to do,
unless they are very nice.

To run "around" the everquest world would probably take about 4 hours also.
but to travel to every zone in the game is very rare and would prabably take
a day or so. Some zones cannot even be accessed by walking. The alter planes
can only be teleported to and there are many continents that must be
travelled to by boat. Unless you know a wizard to teleport you. But unlike
ressurections, ports are easy to find.
