I received this on the 31st (ironic that it starts the 30th):
================
Greetings!
Revisit EQ, Free for 7 Days! Just log in!
Experience once again the thrill of adventuring with old friends and
rediscover the magic.
We're reactivating your closed account for a period of seven days so that
you can check out old friends, reclaim past glories and to experience new
adventures since you departed.
With new expansions like The Legacy of YkeshaT and the upcoming Lost
Dungeons of NorrathT, now is the best time to return to EQ!
Just log into your old account between July 30, 2003 and August 6, 2003, and
you'll find it has been reactivated during this period! (If you can't
remember your login information, there's no problem. Just go to our
Username/Password Recovery page.
We look forward to seeing you again!
-The EverQuest Team
================
You know... if the all-access pass included SWG (And I understand why it
doesn't, but that doesn't mean I have to like it) I might play EQ a bit
still. I also seem to have made it into the beta for the expansion to
EQOA... which is teh funny, as I don't have a Playstation 2, and never
applied for the beta. Once a SOE beta tester always a SOE beta tester??

Must microwave my eq cd's. Must resist temptation. <cuddles SWG cd> They
will not separate us, my precious


Well back to moving dns around (what fun what fun)
