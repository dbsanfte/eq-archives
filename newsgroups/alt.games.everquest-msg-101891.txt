No. But I've found that drinking heavily decreases the annoyance you
feel at the reactions of others to your insanity.

Nobody's ever made it that long without completely losing all grasp of
the game and the sweeping changes that will happen. You're much safer to
just give me all your stuff now and simply start over when you're ready
to come back. (Unless it's ranger only stuff, of course... but then
again, maybe I could sell it. Hrmmm.)

The correct term would be to /shout "Incoming! errrr, I mean, *I'M
coming!"
Or, of course, a simple WOOT would do just fine.
