    That isn't very strong at all. As Sang pointed out, over the course of
the time it takes to kill Tunare her earring would give you the ability to
cast one extra Divine Light, maybe. Whereas that Cloak the melee picked up
off Nagafen increases his personal damage output by a ton. It can only be
remotely considered strong if you outfit the entire healing staff with
them - and given the difficulty of getting dragon haste vs. Flowing Thought
III and above....

    It already is. One poster to this newsgroup has it.

    It was handed to her by Al'Kabor in a GM event. And considering that as
a wizard she had to give Al'Crapor the time of day, let alone roleplay with
him, it could be said to be a very difficult drop. Just looking at Al's
spells, it seems like Harry Potter would outnuke Al'Kabor.
