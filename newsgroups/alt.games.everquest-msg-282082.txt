Well, the game by itself is very small compared to the rest of the
expansions.  If you can find EQ Platinum box, it comes with all but
the last 3 expansions for one price. Since the Platinum seems to have
been discontinued recently, it is possible Sony will be releasing a
newer compilation that covers up to current expansions (all 10)

EQ 2 came out last year and original EQ have been around for more than
6 years.  At this pace EQ 3 won't be out until 2010.
