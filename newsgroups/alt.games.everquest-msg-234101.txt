Well, I'll concede that SOE is ever balancing and rebalancing, to fix
real and perceived problems.

But SOE could have rebalanced any number of ways, from reducing mob
resists to better caster items. AAs may have been used as part of that
rebalancing but none of them were 'needed' on their own merit.

And I maintain that there isn't any AA out there that a caster
'needs', one that he couldn't live without provided he 're-evaluated
his strategy'.

A 9th spell gem at 70th level  would be very handy, and would hardly
be unbalancing. Like everyone else whos been around, we've heard SOE
say no to a 9th spell gem... but then they've said that about a lot of
things. At any rate, I think its a perfectly fine suggestion.
