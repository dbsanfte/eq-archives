But it does, slightly. Your success rate is higher, so it takes fewer rounds
to complete an item.

Crafting is just like adventuring. Sometimes you need to go through a
tedious, time consuming, and totally predictable process to get to the
reward. If you could make a leather stretch in 2 seconds, as you propose,
the market would be flooded with leather items.

Adventuring and crafting is work, hard work. And "hard" sometimes means time
consuming and tedious. I think this is how it should be.

It is strange, though, that we let the game industry take away our leisure
time this way :-)
