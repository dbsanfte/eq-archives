Got my BOT flag yesterday, so I poked in today and worked the
zone for a while.

First impressions; not really any harder than POS giants, lots
more of them available to kill though.  We did earth wing, killed
for a couple hours getting one (count em one) spectral drop.
Finally we gave up working in slowly, invised up, and went in for
a named up at the top of one route.  Although there are
apparantly some see invis mobs in there, they must be few and far
between, because I ended up going up those stairs again 4 times
over the rest of the evening with nothing but invis on (not
slamming out pacifications like I do to get past the see invis
guards into the Kael arena)

Went into a corner, cleared all the surrounding mobs out, and
pulled giant.  (Gaurd Sandstorm or something)

About as hard as the nameds' in POS, it seemed.... until suddenly
the MA dropped dead.  Well we half wiped, evaced the rest.
Invised up, up goes the cleric (me), rez the dead and go again.
Apparantly the mob has a 1500dd proc.  We set up with the chanter
runing to stop that, although it seems to me the MA dropped more
like 4000 hp in one round, rather than just an extra 1500.  Going
fine again, I'm healing sooner, MA HP never drops below 60%...
boom dead.

My group is mostly korean, with some english skills but some
communication difficulties stemming as much from culture as from
language, I think, so I'm having a hard time figuring things
out.  We'd got the mob to 60% first try, to 45% second try.  Get
a new MA in (first one had to log) and set up to go again.   The
chanter (a bot) had told me that she'd gotten 10 resists for slow
but managed it... or so I thought.  Suddenly an off comment by
someone else makes me realize this wasnt the case at all.   Her
slow was sticking fine... she'd cast it 10 times because the mob
kept dispelling it!

It looks like what happened on both MA deaths was that the mob
broke his slow and got off a good couple rounds at full speed,
and during those rounds got a proc off.  At 748 damage high end
per hit, thats 2500 or so plus the 1500... 4000 damage in one
round right about what I thought.

Well, I requested that everyone equip a slow proccing weapon
(nice thing about an all 65 group, you can pretty much rely on
people having some nice gear) and in we went again.  At this
point I use nothing but SE and SR, and I spend a lot of time
cursing the fact that I still don't have SL.  This means that
there's always healing on the way NOW, even though its not as
efficient by a long shot, its less chunky than the old CHeal
method.

At the same time, the mob is almost continuously kept slowed,
with the chanter slowing and four melee all weilding slow
proccing weaponry.  DPS is down a bit, and I'm pouring out less
mana efficient heals... so I start to worry when I get to 20M.  I
announce 20M so we can start considering evac again... and the
mob dies.  Well its not like I have time to check mob HP!

Drops were a Torden's Ring and a Spectral Parchment.  Ring, I'm
told, is for yet another key quest.  One per boss mob is
annoying, at least the ones in POS dropped 3 medalions each.
Spectral was nice though, if named always drops one he's worth
farming, although I suppose thats a "you wish" proposition.

I won niether of the spectrals, but those two make a total of
three I've seen drop to an exp group since release of POP (only
other one was off an agony mephit in PON) and a total of eight
I've seen in my whole POP life, none for myself, although I had
the extra torture of MQing one that ended up going to another
cleric... that Hammer of Damnation should have been Mine!

What else.  Exp was ok, about like a POV group, except of course
for time wasted on the named.  Even that wasnt' too bad, as we
pulled nearby giants and elementals while waiting for members to
recover from rez.
