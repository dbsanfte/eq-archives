I'm sure other people feel/have felt this way, perhaps someone has an idea
how to deal with it?

EQ just feels WAY too much like work.  It's tedious, monotonous, and nearly
impossible to get anything accomplished when I'm trying to.  20-odd Large
Yellowjackets killed over the course of nearly 16 hours /played, not a
single damn tergite.  I just want some shiny pants, for crying out loud.
That really put the icing on the cake, being completely unable to have any
fun without pouring in literally days of my life.  If I'm going to work,
I'll go out and earn $20/hour doing something I'm good at, instead of
wasting my time and *paying* for the privilege!

What am I doing wrong?
