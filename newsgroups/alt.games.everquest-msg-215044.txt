The cure spells seem to come in real handy for LDoN trapped chests. So
far I havent' run across anything that Disinfecting Aura (shaman
version of Pure Blood) wouldn't cure. I think it's important enough
that I'm heading back to LoY to finish up the quest for my group cure.


As for BoR, I'd rate it as one of the more useful spells, although
less so if you have a druid velious BP with the free regen. I use it
all the time as a shaman.
