No, it doesn't. The term isn't unique to the game and, thus, IT IS NOT
THEIR PLACE TO REDEFINE IT. The gaming community decided the
definitions of these terms long ago and they will not change just
because Cryptic says so.

However, Xocyll is wrong about another thing: Cryptic HASN'T held a
different definition for the term. It's just that killstealing, in
general, isn't against their rules. They're not redefining it, they're
just not punishing it unless it is done excessively to the point of
harassment. It's still killstealing and still the same definition.
