New expansions give you more levels, more AA's, more spells and power, so
that YOU can do content with a lot less than we needed.
VT used to require a 50 person raid with several <key classes> and still had
a good chance of wiping.  Nowadays VT can be 1-2 grouped, we had a mage tank
mini Aten about a year ago, a cleric tank the 1.something hitting aten
goos.. so im pretty sure you can tank it with a lot less than 72...

Kod'taz has gear equivalent to plane of time drops.. from random trash and 1
group named.. I eagerly await your next "I QUIT THIS SUCKS" post, because
you can't tank there either.

You want all the good stuff, without doing any of the work. Have you ever
actually worked on stuff like the VT key?
