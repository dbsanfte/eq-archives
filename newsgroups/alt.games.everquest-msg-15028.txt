The piece name _is_ more detail than you would have, just by looking.  

}objects are distinctive...

If objects _were_ distinctive, you wouldn't need to look.

If I pass someone on the street, and they seem to be wearing a nice shirt, 
_that_ is how much I would know.  I wouldn't know whether it was a 
Damask Robe or a Raw Silk Tunic ulness I checked the tag.

For those that are unclear, it may be worth noting that damask is, if I 
recall correctly, a kind of silk.

And if they're wearing something I never saw before, like say... a 
Tolapumj's Robe, I'm certainly not going to know what that is unless I 
check the tag on it.  But rather than walk up and stick my hand down the 
back of their neck, maybe I could just _ask_ them what it is.  99 and 
44/100% of the time, I'm sure they'd be glad to tell me.

Let me summarize:  _You_ may not think it's checking the tag, but some 
subset of the people you encounter _will_ feel that way.  It takes next to 
no effort to behave in a manner that takes these people's feelings into 
account.  So would you rather tromp all over peoplee's feelings and then 
rant about how they're dumb for feeling that way, or would you rather 
respect their feelings, not have to rant, and possibly make more friends?
