    It gets even worse once they get Root. You've seen druids rot mobs, and
how efficient. Now imagine someone who has Pact-line mana regen working on
him, has six DoT lines to choose from, has root and snare, and if he doesn't
feel like re-rooting can always send the pet to finish while he pulls the
next.

    Buddy of mine once chatted with a necro that was rotting stuff in
Crystal Caverns. Everyone that came along was bugging the necro about not
even having a pet up, but as he told my buddy, "I don't even need him, so
why have him up?" That is soloing power.
