Just wondering, the other day, one of my characters wanted to go to
the Qeynos Catacombs, so I went to the pool in South Qeynos by the
bank.  Instead of zoning into the Qeynos Catacombs, I wound up zoning
into the Feerott!  Once there I got a message saying something like
"character is under the world at -200,000, 10,000 (not sure of
numbers), relocated to safe point" or something like that.  I don't
remember exactly where in the Feerott I was at (you can barely see
your hand in front of your face there anyway, but I just know I didn't
see any ogres or any other mobs around), but I just gated back.  I did
do a /bug report, but I'm just wondering if this has ever happened to
anyone else.

Thanks in advance,
