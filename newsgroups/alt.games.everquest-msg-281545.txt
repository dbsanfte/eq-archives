You mean people are still getting 2 or 3 AAs an hour, risk free.
People are still selling, that's right, selling "seats" on their
monster missions so that you can get AA or level while they solo the
mission at 3AM?

Very simple: make sure you hit the entire raid with both AOEs before
the first heal goes off.  This gets enough hate on Naggy that most or
all of the raiders will ignore the clerics.  This also means that any
tanks who are in the mission should back the hell up and let the entire
raid come to Naggy when is spawns.  Good way to wipe the healers is for
some guy playing Warlord Skarlon (SP?) or Tranix to try and "help" by
agroing 3 or 4 out on the bridge before they get to Naggy.  He gets
plenty of hate from the one he is hitting, the other 2 or 3 that agro
on him?  Nothing.  And when the heals start coming, guess who they
wanna kill?

One other thing: keep everyone close to Naggy.  You will get rooted
away from the others and be unable to heal, or be healed.  This is very
bad if yoru other healers happen to be charmed or dead at the time.

Annoying but not hard to overcome.  I'm not sure what is wrong with
your duck key.

How many healers did you start with?
