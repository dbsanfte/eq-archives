Disappointing nobody wanted a cookie. And I just got my baking to 142.

If you get Nortlav the Scalekeeper alone (or have the faction to stand
there and not get ganked) and hail him, that is his response. I've
researched it to death and can't find anyone who's ever gotten a
different answer, though I'd have SWORN the bastard MUST have a quest or
something to give out. But if you hail him, at least with Indifferent
faction, that's what he'll say. Further questions, words, etc. have
produced no other resonse to date that I've found.
