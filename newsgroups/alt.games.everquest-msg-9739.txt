Awwww! now you went and spoiled my optimisim.  MY pessimistic side agrees
that verant could and would do something like this.
I sure hope not!

>Being the optimistic type, I think that is the point. My inner pessimist
(and when

famine will
>jack up the prices of supplies (spices will now cost a gold each, etc.) and
that
>the meat drop rate will decrease dramatically (if the players are starving,
>certainly the animals are, too, and don't have so much meat on their
bones.) Fish,
>too, will become scarce as rivers become poisoned and the plague will kill
off
>those mutant bats with three wings. As a result, baking will become
hiddeously
>expensive to do, meaning that players will STILL buy from merchants.
