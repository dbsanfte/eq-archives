Yes... that struck me as an excellent and much-needed feature.  Then, when 
I fall asleep in group, my groupmates can play their alarm clocks next to 
the microphones and actually get me to wake up. :)  Well, assuming I turn 
sounds back on.  I just hope they have those sounds on a separate filter, 
and it isn't tied to music or environmental sounds.

But unless it's really award-quality acting, my interest in having them 
read aloud quest dialogue to me... is nil.  I can read just fine, 
-without- waking up my flatmates.
