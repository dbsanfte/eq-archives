Imagine the database that it would take to keep Track of Everything
everyplayer would leave for the Vendors to sell. Oh look a Server Crash
where is my 200k in Items I left with the Vendor /petition I want my 200k
the vendor owes me. At least this way the Items never leave your possession
till the sale is made. But the real reason is Verant knows traders will
start a Second account to keep a Trader up and selling  while they are
playing so Verant can get more money.
