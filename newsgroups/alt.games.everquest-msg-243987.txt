Only problem here is, on FV I can't bind where ever I want to. :) I got used
to that on the Nameless, then came to FV and...oops, can't bind outside of a
city. Hence my single bind point in PoK. :) Gonna have to look up
faithstone, no clue what that is (I swear I'm not a newbie! lol).

My in-character brother has amiable Paineel faction, and he bought us our
hole key (no drop on FV).
