Someone mentioned in guild chat last night that some of the gods are
anagrams.  I'm sure this is old, old news to many folks here, but it was
news to me.

Povar = vapor
The Rathe = earth
Fennin Ro = inferno (with an extra n)
Xegony = oxygen
Tarew = water
E'ci = ice

That got me thinking about my character's god... Rodcet Nife, also called
the Prime Healer.  I tried playing with the letters... I have two possible
solutions, either "fine doctor" with one vowel change, or "doctor knife"
with the vowel change and a dropped consonant.  I'm leaning towards "fine
doctor" at the moment.

I tried finding anagrams for "Mithaniel" and "Rallos Zek" and haven't been
successful yet, unless Rallos = solar.

Any other god anagrams?

And yes, before you mention it, I'm aware that Qeynos is "Sony EQ" spelled
backwards.  =)
