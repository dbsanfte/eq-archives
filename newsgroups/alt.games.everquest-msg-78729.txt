Been a bit since my druid did this part but I seem to recall he appears
at a particular time of the EQ day, so if he's not up when you get there
most you should have to wait would be an hour or so, just watch
tracking.  I found him walking along the road between WC and Rivervale. 
He's not KOS, you can chat him up or just hand him the item.  The
instant you do he will despawn and spawn that reaver so be prepared to
be insulted and attacked heh.  I snared and rooted him so as not to drag
to zone with me and then just for the heck of it started rotting him. 
Was late and he looked to have a lot of hp so I just left him rooted and
bailed.
