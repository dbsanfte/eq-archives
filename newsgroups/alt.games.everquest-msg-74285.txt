I actually tend to agree. At this point in EQ's lifecycle with, of
course, High level players being the only one able to afford houses
yet these same high level players being used to not having them for 51
- 60 levels I can't really see what "huge improvement" theyd be. 

Guess what my 55 - 60 guild does when we are all online? We go and
raid stuff like TOV or go and build xp. Guess what we don't do? We
don't hang around in one area and chat. Therefore I'm kind of not
seeing the point of a guild house unless it did offer storage in some
way. 

The thing is though, every guild I know including mine just has a
couple xtra accounts which are communal (though verant frowns on it
but nothing seems to happen so what the hey) and only have "bank"
characters. About 3 or 4 people in the guild have the bank char logins
and are able to get them on to make BD items to sell to guild members,
give spells to someone who finally made level 60, etc. So in other
words, through their own devices players already do any of the only
real beneficial things which might come with guild housing. Besides
that, if it was just communal storage in guild housing it would be a
security issue and you'd still put things on "guild banker" characters
instead if they were of value. You would not want everyone in your
guild wandering through the guild house looking at stuff and going
"ooh my twink could use that.." or "ooh I could sell that for PHAT
PLATZ!" So once again you might have to have a password limitation
even for a few people in your own guild so then you kind of get back
to square one; how would that system be better than having guild
banker characters?

Outside of storage what possible point would there be for housing?
Do you know what I'd really like far more than housing and what would
be far easier for verant to do? I'd like 20 more bank slots on my main
char if I paid say 100 k for it. I have no need for a building that I
can walk into and say ooh my house.. and then stand there for a while
then go "er.. kay guess I'll go and do stuff." 

Truth be told houses in UO were only used for a few things which for
the most part you can't really do in EQ anyway:

1) Trapping of animals, sometimes even at their spawn points. Players
would block animals into such a house, even ones like elementals, then
build skills by attacking them or getting cast on by the elemental.
I'm not even talking about macroing really there but just normal lazy
play. I even heard they built house on rare spawns sometimes to trap
creatures with a desireable product or who were a desireable mount
they could train and then sell to other players for big bucks. 

Reason why thats moot in EQ: animals can't be trapped (they just walk
through the walls)

2) Trade goods making at a safe spot where people could not steal from
you, shacks to store ore near where you mine it.

Reason why thats moot in EQ: trade goods can only be made around the
vendors with the stuff anyway, you don't "mine" ore but rather just
buy most smithing things (or get others as far too rare drops). Of
course the largest reason is you can't steal from players anyway.

3) storage of tons of reagents and phat lewt which would not fit in
your bank.

Reason why thats moot in EQ: well its really not but reagents are not
used in EQ (thank gad) so that eliminates one storage problem right
there. As far as phat lewt by the time you are getting it you'd have 8
x 10 containers in the bank making 80 slots to store stuff in if my
math is right. Its more ideal for players to sell of aquired goods
rather than hoard them so in a way the limitation is good (something
else I'd again like to have instead of a house is say 10 bank slots
just for lore quest items (especially with the luclin quests.. ouch)

4) Cybering. Yes, believe it or not many people used houses as places
to go in and cyber away from the masses when you had no way to private
message really in UO. Rogue "ghost" enemies of the person who had got
into the house somehow then would make some HILARIOUS screenshots of
this.

Reason why this is moot in EQ: well its not really moot again, but you
actually see people who are probably cybering in EQ a lot. You can't
tell if they are since they have group chat. Everytime I see a male
and female character sitting facing each other for a very long time in
EQ while I'm running around doing stuff I think "ooooh naughty cyber
long time..." If I'm running around with someone else I'll go "hey
look over here.. naughty cyberers!!!! then the other person usually
laughs.

Oh well, my I've been babbling for a while and basically wrote a small
novel..
