I thought "eyes glazed over" was the mez message?  Or is it the same for
both?

Having it all on screen at the same time would prove really difficult, it
would only take 2 seconds to have my on-screen chat box filled with my hits
(with my misses, other hits, and mob misses turned off)

Had it been Sebilis, Im pretty sure it would have been resolved within 5
minutes of his being a dick.. velk isn't the easiest place to kill somebody
though, even if you train him its not difficult to deal with.

With me alone playing my monk and cleric (60 and 58) I can handle 5 mobs at
the same time, consisting of upto 2 statues and whichever spiders it happens
to be.. I try not to pull so many cuz it burns all my clerics mana, but if
that many agro I can handle it (without root parking or anything) I just hit
them all for a few hundred damage to hold agro (so the cleric can sit/heal)
and then just work my way through them, with them all beating on me.  If
just i can hold so many, a competent group should easily be able to handle
10+ mobs.. and if you can even find 10 mobs alive at once, you can't be in
velk!

Whats the range of bard songs?  In phsyical terms... like if hes stood on
the platform at the bottom of the FF 'ramp' (higher up then eyes but not the
very top platform) how far will his songs reach?  Do they agro above and
below? With something in the way? (ie if i FD above the ramp I am very close
to them, but its not LOS cuz the ramp obscures your view)

Lol that would be classic.   Asshole was injured by falling!  Asshole has
fallen to his death!
As far as throwing shurikens, well they do a max of like 36 damage on a
critical throw, so they aren't gonna outagro charm/mez.

I was bitching in guild chat at the time, asking if anybody knew him.. they
were a bit more harsh then some people here.. "train his fucking ass" and if
Im honest, I'd have probably done it given the chance.   I've only ever
caused one deliberate train in all my 90+ levels of my monk (and maybe 5
accidental pulls total, im a cautios puller.. maybe over-cautios heh)

When I was 59 I went on a failed gore raid.. Idiot cleric was sticking
everybody in the middle of DL, so every few seconds gore would come and kick
our ass again.. You know how exp is at 59, and I logged with several
unrezzed corpses in DL.  I spoke with a friend on the phone the next day as
he ran his necro and cleric to the DL/FV tunnel, then when he was ready, I
logged in and ran from FV to DL (I logged and stayed out to ensure my rez
timers)

So anyway he casts summon corpse, and yep you guessed it... "there are no
corpses in this zone".  The exp was what hurt the most (a yellow bub in 59)
and the head gm wouldn't do shit, Zrinic really was the laziest pos gm you
could ever meet.

After that I was ready to quit EQ for good, I was totally disheartened to
remake all that exp (I was only a blue from 60 when it happened) and
eventually agreed to group with a friend in Sebilis to see how it went.
On Prexus, named mobs are generally respected very well, 9.8 times out of 10
in Sebilis at least..

Anyway we were in D1 (disco1) and Disco2 came and ganked our named mob... My
group was livid, I was already set to quit.. they were in big guilds, and i
spoke to officers in their guilds, got a really shitty reply.. i told them
to apologise and hand over the loot, they told me to go to hell.. so i did
them a favour and pulled for them.. I guess I just pulled a few too many
though.

I wasn't proud, but IMO I gave them enough chances to settle it in the right
mannar, and they bought it on themselves.

I'll do that, thanks.  I bet sitting in the middle of their group saying and
doing nothing (and unknown to them /logging the bard songs) would freak them
out a lil.
