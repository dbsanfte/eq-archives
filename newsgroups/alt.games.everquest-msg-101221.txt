Not sure about the background of the Magelo stuff and what it's issues are
but as someone who has put together a few very basic web pages by first
making html skeletons in notepad, then "prettifying" in Dreamweaver 3 and/or
4 I learned to dislike Netscape with a vengeance. I had no problems with how
they came out in Opera though.

I wasn't doing anything odd either - all the layout was just done with plain
old ordinary tables using the KISS principul. No frames, no style sheets,
not even the slightest hint of DHTML. A page would be done in a day and
tested with IE and Opera and maybe a few tweaks needed. Then I would spend
the next week or so of spare time trying to figure out and work around what
the hell Netscape was trying to something as simple as tables within tables
within tables.

In the end since the pages were unofficial and mainly for my own use, a few
friends and colleagues - I broke the KISS principul and used browser
detection javascript to get around it. Netscape users got their own text
page to veiw whilst everyone else got the site as intended. The text?

"Netscape and me do not get along but I have no problem with that. This page
can be veiwed as intended with either IE or Opera. Knowing the solution, if
you have still have a problem with this then please do not make the
presumption to think that this is something that should warrant my
attention."

One rabid Netscape defender (They are like Mac'ites) person took exception
but when he called I just said "Netscape 6.0" and we both ended up laughing
it off.
