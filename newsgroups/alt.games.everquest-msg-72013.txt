I've been trying to add some small narrative parameters to my hot keys. I
want to use emotes more often and I want to link them to action. Obviously
not with every arrow I release but every now and again, to add a little
spice to the overal roleplaying.
When grouping in crushbone with the whole group standing on the table I
always got alot of prase for
/em knocks over a vase on the table
/say Err, sorry about that

and

/cast 4 (root)
/em thumbs his nose at %t
/say I did warn you, now you die

anyway, I've been experimenting with:

/em nocks an arrow and draws the bowstring in one fluent movement
/em holds his breath while taking aim and releases his arrow with deadly
accuracy
/firearrow

The problem is that I can't get my bow to fire automatically. I tryed using
/doability 2 but it's not a doability. Is there a way to command combat
skills?

Second problem. I don't like the resulting lines that start with my name.
Sennes does this
Sennes does that
Sennes does this again

I'd rather change it to 'he' .
' With one fluent move, Sennes nocks an arrow and draws his bow'
'He holds his breath while taking aim and releases'
/rangeattack

Is there a way to create general emotes such as ' a bird chirps' or ' the
arrow bounces of the plate armor on %t'
I know the game can handle that, because verant uses these too.
