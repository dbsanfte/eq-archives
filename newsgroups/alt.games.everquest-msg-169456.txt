Questions first, for the easily bored, then a short explanation of what
I want the information for.

At what level does Ranjah tracking become useful (in terms of range) to
the point where you can track a fair distance of, say.... one quarter of
the zone in Steamfont? Specifically so you could pick four spots to
check and see most everything in the zone. Or perhaps stand dead center
in the middle of it and see *most* of the zone?

Second: How does advancement in tracking range work? Is it linear with
"x" number of yards tacked on per level? Or are there some golden
"breakthrough" levels where it suddenly gets way more useful?

Background:  Messing around with some nekkid newbie characters on Test
server, wife's mage is doing the newbie armor quests and needs a
"Brittle Skeleton". Research shows he's a rare beast at the best of
times and can pop almost anyplace.

Never fear, I create a level one Woody Ranger and bind him in Ak'anon
and go to track it down for her. Well... level one Ranjah tracking SUCKS
ASS. I can track stuff bascially that I can already see if I'm not in
the middle of ten trees. So I level him up to five and max tracking. Ok,
looks a *bit* better on range, but still not all that many mobs and I
don't think  I'm "seeing" that far away yet.

I'd like to, if possible, be able to either track about a quadrant of
the zone, or stand in the center and track most of the zone, but don't
want to have to spend three months leveling up to fifty just for that.

How and when does tracking get useful for these sort of needs?
