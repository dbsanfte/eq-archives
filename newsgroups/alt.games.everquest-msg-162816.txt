    I've gained a hundred or so HPs going 61-65, and a couple hundred points
of MANA. That's not counting the extra room I have for WIS/STA buffs to give
me even more.

    No perhaps about it. ;-)

    I couldn't stand against a yellow mob in PoV and self-heal while waiting
for help. I can now that they're blue. Either my defense is better, or I
have a better inherent chance to channel spells with a reduced chance to
fizzle (I forgot about that the first time through), or both.

    Well, there's three of them at level 64. Unless you know of some way to
ding to 64 without dinging 63 first, I'd say you had to do this anyways.

    I hate doing this, since Verant reps do read this, but....

    I would guess the real reason these high-level mobs are such insane XP -
not just good, like Juggs was before, but mind-numbingly awesome - is that
all the high level XP bonuses were hard coded with a max level of 60 in
mind. Just like how briefly a level 65 monk's fists were 18/20 weapons, and
just like how right now a Sneaking level 65 rogue is running at SoW speed
without SoW, the code was put in place assuming level 60 was the max level.
You can take lower-level characters to PoP zones to hunt the Dire Charmable
mobs to verify it isn't just a ZEM thing, like many assume.

    They still give me the same AA XP/kill at 65 as they did at 62.

    That really depends on your gear level and that nebulous thing called
"skill". People with great gear and skills should get flagged ASAP and go XP
on the really good stuff. People with weaker gear will need all the help
they can get. There's places for these people to level up - in 10 or 11
hours I went 61-->62 in PoD at the castle, and since I was with a fair
number of recruits the gear level wasn't exactly incredible. And we had no
ENC, only a SHM. Had I been in PoV, I'd estimate it would have taken 7
hours. So a time savings, but not a huge one.

    There's some interesting critters to XP on in PoN, for sure. I hear some
of them drop parchments for level 63-64 spells.... I also hear that a
certain ogre in PoD gives a quest for individual flags to a second-tier
plane, but that can't be true, can it?

    Almost none of the 65 clerics out there now have any level 65 spells.
You wouldn't be the only one. I don't have many of my spells either. But as
they come from the quest NPC, or get handed to me by the guild, they get
scribed. That's a lot faster than waiting for the spells, then trying to get
the levels.
