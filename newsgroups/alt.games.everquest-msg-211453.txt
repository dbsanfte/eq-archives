I haven't used Harmony in a while, so maybe it's changed, but I cannot
recall ever having Harmony resisted except when the mob was too high
to stick a spell to (i.e. more than 6 levels higher when you're under
L28 and more than 25% higher than your level when you're L28+), or too
high for Harmony itself after the nerf (i.e. over L40).  This is not,
of course, true of Nature's Harmony, which can be resisted and is only
single target rather than AE like Harmony.  Anyhow, with the condition
for Harmony being resisted basicly meaning you're trying it on mobs
that are deep red, or at least mobs that are over L40, it's not at all
surprising that a Harmony resist leads to unpleasantness, especially
solo.
