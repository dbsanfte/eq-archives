I went to visit Niagara Falls about a month ago. I saw this movie call
"Everest" or something like that which talks about the discovery and history
of Niagara Falls. The title font looks exactly like Everquest except it has
no "q" in it. At first I thought I must be that I play too much EQ, after
robbing my eyes and look at it again, I felt a bit relief that I wasn't
seeing illusions.
