Theres only 8 froggies on the way to the spiders, so unless someone pull a
train down spider cave he wont have froggie problems.
The problems are the spiders. As a level 22 druid i could JUST survive down
there, went down a few times due to greed (giant heart spider, didnt wanna
loose it).
You need to master crowd control if you solo down there at that level, if
just 1 spider run, youre gonna need luck to get back to the swamp alive, he
WILL pull the 10 others.
I could take them 1 at a time, so if i got the first one rooted, snare and
kill the second one, snare and kill the rooted one.
Then med up, try the giant spider room, root 2, snare and kill them 1 at a
time, if the all charge - RUN.
Their poison are quite nasty too, so be sure to have a cure handy.

You might wanna wait until youre around level 28 for safety purposes. I PL
fighters down there untill level 19, and 20% of the mobs are still blue at
that level, so do NOT go down there before level 20 or so, and still be VERY
careful. But if youre areund level 30, the spiders will NOT help each other,
and you can easily beat them all up.
