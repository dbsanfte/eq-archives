Some major news service (BBC, I think) published an interesting table
showing how many citizens of various countries worked in the WTC.  There
were a lot.  E.g., something like several hundred Pakistan citizens worked
there.  For several dozen countries, including Pakistan, that attack was the
largest terrorist attack against their citizens ever.

In the long term, the terrorists are going to lose, because they are stupid.
The advantage of fanaticism isn't enough to overcome their stupidity.
Attacking targets inside America is just dumb.  A smart terrorist would
*use* the United States.  Take a look at, say, Irish terrorists.  They were
largely funded by private donations from the United States, even though they
were operating against the British, who are one of the United States'
closest allies.  That's the way to use the US.

Hell, there are *plenty* of people in the US who dislike or even hate
Israel, and *plenty* of people in the US who think the US should get the
heck out of Saudi Arabia (non-Muslims, such as US troops, in Muslim holy
lands, such as Saudi Arabia, is one of the big things that bin Laden is
pissed off over).  bin Laden could have accomplished a lot more toward his
goals by keeping the terrorists away, and instead spending some money in the
US, for things like financing anti-Israel groups, right-wing isolationist
groups, and left-wing anti-military groups, etc.  Those groups aren't going
to get power and directly do the things bin Laden wants, but they can make
those things issues, and shift public opinion a bit away from Israel and
away from maintaining troops on Muslim holy land, and cause the people in
power to pull back some on their Israel and Saudi policy, making bin Laden's
operations in those countries more effective.
