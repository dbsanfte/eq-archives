I've had a similar idea, except I'd have it be a mana drain.  So, if you
cast a 50 mana buff that has a duration of 100 ticks, that would take 50
mana right away, and then start a 1 mana per 2 tick mana drain to maintain
the buff.  If you die, the buff is no longer maintained, and so expires
normally after 100 more ticks.

The main problem with this is that you'd need some way to be able to cancel
these at the caster's end, and that could be a lot of work for Sony.

DAoC has something kind of similar.  There is a stat separate from power
(which is the equivalent of EQ mana) called "concentration".  Some buffs
work like EQ buffs...they take power to cast, and have a certain duration,
then are gone.  However, there are other buffs that take concentration
instead of power.  Unlike power, concentration does not regen, so if you
have 100 concentration, and cast a 10 concentration buff on someone, your
concentration drops to 90 and stays there.  There is a concentation window
you can bring up which lists all the concentration buffs you've cast and who
they are on, and you can click them off from there, cancelling the buff and
getting the concentration back.  Note that this system means that if the
buffer dies, everyone with buffs from that person instantly loses those
buffs, so keeping buffers alive can be important.
