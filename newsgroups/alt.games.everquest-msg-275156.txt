What we do not seem to agree is simply this: a place of business is not a
home - in my opinion. It is a place open to the public and that invites the
public to come in (as a general rule - there might be exceptions). It is
simply obvious that the rules cannot be the same. In my country a
restaurant, for instance, can open only if licensed by the relevant
autorithies. Arbitrary discrimination of customers can be a reason for the
repeal fo the license. It is a rare occurence, of course.

Wrong about what? About the way things are in my country (do you happen to
know something I ignore?) or about liking it? And in this second case,
what's nice then? Excuse me, but I really cannot understand.
