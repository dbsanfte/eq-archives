Fishing is good for cheap food. It is also the only immediately profitable
trade skill, bait costs 4 cp, fish sells for a couple silver. You won't get
rich at it, but at low levels you can actually make enough for a few pieces
of leather amour. I started fishing heavily around level 13 when I was
hunting Wisps in Eruds Crossing. I would hunt solo, then fish while sitting
and healing. I still fish whenever I am waiting for a boat, or waiting for a
buddy to show up to group, or whenever I have some downtime. There are a
couple minor items for quests you can fish, like saltwater seaweed in OOT,
and you can catch some huge bass in FV, but basically the skill is just
something to waste time on. I use it as a roleplaying aid, anyone who knows
me knows I pull out the pole and fish whenever I get a chance. Rangers and
Druids give me their grubs instead of throwing them on the ground, and my
clerical buddy is always teasing me to try fishing in any little body of
water we see. As a result I know you can catch fish in that little pond on
the top level of Runnyeye, in the moat around Crushbone, and you can fish
through the ice in Everfrost. I was a little disappointed to discover that
even after becoming a master fisherman, I STILL spill my beer.
