X-Comment: When asked by author Bob Woodward if he ever explained his positions, Bush answered, �Of course not. I�m the commander � see, I don�t need to explain why I say things. That�s the interesting thing about being the president. Maybe somebody needs to explain to me why they say something, but I don�t feel like I owe anybody an explanation.� [Washington Post, Nov. 19, 2002]
