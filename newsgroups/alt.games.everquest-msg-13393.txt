The problem I see with HK is how quickly it fills up.  If you find that
there are no spots on your server, a good place to go is Kunark.  Lake of
Ill Omen, AKA: LOIO, is great for a wide range of levels.  There is even a
newbie zone in there, or so I have heard.

I know plenty of people that have gone to LOIO at L15, and not left till
L29.  However, past L27 LOIO slows down.  There is then a large gap before
you can take the mobs in the water.

Next to LOIO is Frontier Mountains, which is slightly better XP, but not
much.  However, there are some nice drops to roll for.  This can help
casters get the cash for their L29 spells.  So if you play FM from L27 to
L29 you may not level as fast, but you will get loot.

On the other side of FM is The Overthere.  OT is a great XP place for 27+
groups.  You can stay high on the wall near the FM zone and have tanks do
pulls up to the casters.  If you do this, there is much less risk of getting
trained.  Solid XP into the 30s, with some better level spread.

If you want to go to the other side of the world at L29, Velious is nice.
Get bound in Thurgadin and hunt The Great Divide.  There are Tismaks near
Thurgadin in GD that will be decent XP, and better yet, Velium weapons.  You
may not want a Velium weapon, by they can sell to a merchant for 5pp or
more.  In an extended camping each person in the party can get two or three
of these.  15pp and decent XP is nothing to sneeze at.  When the XP falls
off on Tismaks, go to the other side of GD and hunt Kodiak bears, and Wurms.
These can hold you into your 40s if you start with bears and small wurms and
work up to the big wurms.  Some peeps in my guild have done this and been
very successful.  I'm working on Kodies right now myself.

Also, there is Crystal Caverns when you hit about 35.  XP and Drops are both
supposed to be good.  I plan on hunting there very soon.

Vetin, Clan of the Cloudwalkers
31 Enchanter
The Rathe server

PS.  No, you can't have Clarity when I'm in a group and busy.  Catch me when
I'm by myself.
