Copy/pasted from the Druid's Grove
"
Lev: In the deep, take a right at the first intersection, then a left at the
second intersection. The "Deranged Underbulk" is an uncommon spawn for the
mob furthest in (the PH) in that dead end, and it drops Lev.

EB: In Tenebrous Mountains, on the top (3rd) floor of the big vampire
castle, Trilexior Aeridia had EB as his rare drop. He's on of four nameds in
the castle. He's an enchanter, and though he's blue to me and I have 172 MR
with normal gear, his nukes seem to stick on me quite a bit. He will gate,
so fight him on the top floor. He will dispell you, and his dispell seems to
take random buffs, and not the top four. He will also run if you're not
fighting a second mob with him, and he can't be snared/rooted.
"

Suffice it to say, they're fucking rare spells, that are in high demand.
I've basically given up on ever having them. (although a druid friend of
mine says she has Levitation from something in paludal caverns, I remain
dubious though)  There's people who will pay over 20k for either of these
spells (desperate bastards I guess), and the last (only) copy of EB I saw
for sale lasted one auction at 25k.
