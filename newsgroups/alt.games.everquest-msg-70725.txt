Sometimes I wonder if this game isn't one big sick sociology experiment.
Lets see exactly how good we need to make the rewards before we can get people
to abandon all pretense of playing in character.

The only time I have actually seen them not make stupid decisions like this,
is with the paladin, ranger and druid armor not dropping in Plane of Growth.
(Although the druid spells do, in large amounts.)    But then, that may be a
separaete experiment all it's own.   "Now to be truly evil, lets take three
non essential classes, and make only thier armor (and nobody elses) drop in a
completely different raid level enviroment.   How often will it get raided?
How much begging will those three classes have to do to convince the warriors,
clerics and enchanters to turn out, just to help them?"
