Get Warrior and invis and a port to GD, run him in to Thurgadin,
then onward into Icewell Keep.  Kill Coldian and have him
loot the no drop armor.  He won't be KOS in there, so as long
as he doesn't fall in a pit this is safe as houses.  Course you'll
be taking coldain hits, but surprisingly small ones, it takes
a -very- long time killing coldian in Icewell before you lose even
one faction level.

Get your warrior an invis and a port to CS, then run him in to
Skyshrine, find an empty room and park him there.  Then
pull stuff to his room and kill it, when pieces of Guardian drop
that you like, have him swap in and loot it.  This is scarier
than Thurgadin, as he's certainly going to be KOS in SS... on
the other hand the armor is better too.
