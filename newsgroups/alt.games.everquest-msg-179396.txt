Auto split would just give me lots and lots of gold, silver and copper, that
I don't really wanna carry around for any period of time.. regardless of
whether somebody will change it for me.

I guess I need more input on it then.. not even sure I (she) has the time
for another trade skill... my shamans alchemy is 160 atm, and I just dumped
another 10k on him for skillups, but then I think..

"Ok i got my DS potions (which don't fuckin stack anyway), is there actually
any point GMing it?"

Cuz even as a bot, I can get much better gear wise for that slot that the
trophy (when you see 125hp/vengance 3 gloves rot, and 2 lunar fungis in a
row FFA (no tells.. so a no-merit item for whoever loots it first)

My nome wizard is 130ish tinkering too, but again.. whats the point maxing
it, cuz WTF will he make on a continued basis thats worth a thing?  I want a
GVD.. but I think I'll just buy the damn thing than get his skill up and
make a 1-off item

Not to mention shes working on her own baking, and all that other retarded
stuff for the shawl (all my close friends in the game are trade skill
freaks, such an odd combo! I know like 4 people who are GM's in at least 3
skills in just my small(ish) circle of friends)

Serverwide "popular" channels just have too many freakin people in.  I was
on a camp once, totally bored, and seeing the continous spam in monkly-bus
channel was just too much.  I lasted like 5 mins.

I get distracted too easily.. normally i always raid/pull with every channel
open.. but on odd occasion theres a huge discussion in AGE, and if i try to
follow it id end up dead in 0.2 of a second

Agro is bullshit at low levels.  I could pull a mob with turgers (the big
shaman slow) and 1 (missed) arrow would get agro instantly on me.

Snare... when im charming in PoP, I have a ranger ensnare the mob on a charm
break.  He instantly gets agro over my charm hate. (ensnare a few times
means I can re-tash and re-charm with like zero agro)

Whilst on my rogue, playing with my girlfs ranger, she would snare a mob
4,5,6 times in a row, I'd have attack off, and STILL the fucker wouldn't
turn from me

Its getting better now im killing mobs 40-50...  but 1-35 especially was
such a crock of shit.  No wonder level 60's nowadays don't have a clue how
to play in a group

You lose like 1 BS, if the group is shitty at positioning it, thats what.. 1
second slower kill rates? :)

Omg im a mage (sortof...) and im your friend!

I use him every now and then for PLing (for the damage shield.. kinda sucks
I don't have a 60+ druid (access to a 56 only) but mage+cleric is better
anyway) and I sometimes think, damn, mages are kinda cool to play afterall.

Then I exp him for all of an hour, and remember why I think mages SUCK so
much.


I tried druid/mage combo in Chardok (well with shaman, clericand enchanter
backup)...  he has to tank, so I can't use my BS pet (who is a gimp, he just
happens to backstab too).. or the druid charms a little doggy, he pwns my
pet so tanks (so i can use BS pet) but then charm breaks, the mob stays on
my pet and doesnt lose agro, so he now can't BS, and is a gimpy tank

Was thinking about trying a mage combo again, this time with her on 55
bard.. but I don't see how it will be different.  And since bard songs won't
aid the pet..  the combo won't exactly be an uber killing team will it.

More than that tho, i just make a bad fulltime caster.  I can't sit on my
ass 95% of the time, standing to nuke then sitting back down... if I don't
see a screen full of my melee hits I get impatient and bored

I paid 80kpp for my CoF, and they are 70kish in the bazaar now

I still have to skillup!  So no thx!  While im PLing I just summon arrows,
im sure when the mage isnt about I'll use daggers, and likely summon my own

But it doesnt save you from enough damage to make a healer un-needed...
even with 200 skill its slow, unreliable, and doesn't stop all that much
damage

They were on the floor :)
Anyway, I didn't mean disarm never works or anything.. I just mean its got
no purpose to it.
Shit hits just as hard either way, and your losing DSP trying to disarm.

Well I was gonna say don't be, you have a cute rogue.. but NO, you rerolled
as a FUGLY BARB!
Your as fugly as my rogue now...  whats a woman gonna do, when she doesnt
even have looks going for her?  Well.. I guess barbs have other assets. but
still..

> BSs are never as good when other people are around as when you're solo

me:  wow they are really fucking aow up!
guildie/friend tells the group:
A gimpy ranger tries to hit the Avater of war but misses!
A gimpy ranger tries to hit the Avater of war but misses!
A gimpy ranger tries to hit the Avater of war but misses!
A gimpy ranger tries to hit the Avater of war but misses!
A gimpy ranger tries to hit the Avater of war but misses!
A gimpy ranger tries to hit the Avater of war but misses!

They didn't melee for long tho.. I didn't want them to low level agro or
something and die, cuz if they missed the faction then it was a pointless
trip.

This AoW = fun tho.. the moment he enraged, somebody made him turn
(deliberatly), haha /mourn all the afk ppl and those not paying attention.
Of course Id turned for a split second to move my rogue, so got a big smack
down too.. /hug mend
