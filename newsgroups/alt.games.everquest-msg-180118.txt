I have been steadily plodding along through the Prayer Shawl quests ever
since I started hunting in EW in my 40's. I have reached the pinnacle,
almost anyway. I am nearly ready to do the turn in for the 8th shawl and am
wondering how many people I will need to bring and what classes are most
need to do the 8th shawl crawl. I am in a small, relatively newly formed
guild with about 20 low 50's characters pretty much evenly distributed
through the classes. I am just wondering how much outside help I am going to
need to recruit.

Thanks
