The bonus raw strength gives you is puny. When I started my Rogue way
back when [1], I boosted strength to 75, which according to all credible
sources, was the minimum you could have before taking serious penalties
to your damage. Without even trying, and without giving up a shred of
AC, HP or stamina [2] my current strength is 140ish unbuffed.

If I were to start again, I'd boost my STR to at least 75, and dump the
rest into stamina so I survive longer. Stamina gives superb bonuses to
the HP of pure melee classes 50+. It's the only stat buff I'll bleat
plaintively for. The rest are pretty much junk.

Evade is far from infallible. That nasty bugger will take a swipe at
you. You will be caught in that AE. 

Dead Rogues do no damage.

[1] Dark Elf. Ooh, I can hear the howls of disbelief from here...

[2] And I'm "Ghetto".
