Wasn't quite sure whether to go with FoT of Sunstorm - I was
still out of AE range with Sunstorm.

Time to do a bit of math :)

------------------->

(Conj spec mage)

FoT - Base mana = 500
50 spec = 2.5% savings
SCM3 = 10% savings
Earring focus = 7.5% savings (avg - I've been told it's variable
like damage, would like to see numbers if anyone has them though)

Net - 20% mana savings.

Base damage = 2000.  Avg increase from bracer = 10%
avg damage 2200.

I had no problems emptying my mana pool on this boss without
aggro, so the aggro problems I usually have on boss mobs are a 
non-issue.

so, basically a 5.5:1 damage to mana ratio.

Sunstorm
440 base mana - 20% = 352

3 waves of 800, bracer doesn't affect = 2400 base dam

Fixed secondary resists (according to Graffe's and Tower
tests) is ~20%.

True avg damage = 1920
5.45:1 damage to mana ratio


I went OOM and didn't get summoned until all the melee
had died, my pet became the focus of the mobs attention
(and lived for a bit, he enraged --- GO GO SPIKE!). I
modded early, and the timer went off right after I 
appeared at my bind point - so a 5 minute fight.

If I'd had trouble dumping my mana without aggro, then
sunstorm mixed with FoT's would be my best shot I think.
Given that I managed to dump all my mana (and 5 minutes
of mounted, BoT9+VoQ+FT1 mana) without aggro, FoT was
as good as I had.

I think I pumped in about 30k damage from nukes (over
6k mana even after Mala/'sini attempts)

Now, if I'd had Sun Vortex

Base mana 395.
Spec 200 - 10%
Earring - 7.5%
SCM3 - 10%

~287 mana

1550 base dam *1.1  = 1705 avg dam

5.94:1 damage to mana
Or about 8% more damage out of my mana
30k * 1.08 = 32.4k

Hmmm - no 'sini attempts and Sun Vortex
would have had me over 35k in nukes - enough
to turn the tide.  Wonder if I can convince
the guild to buy me Sun Vortex on that analysis?

:-P
