So what you're saying is that you were wrong to fly off the handle and 
berate me without actually knowing what you were talking about, but you 
can't really retract the insult about my "old and boring cliche" and still 
save any face, even though it was itself merely a means of adding fuel to 
your initial incorrect objection to my actions?

Do me a favor and put a sock in it to match the foot. Your approval is 
really not that important to me.
