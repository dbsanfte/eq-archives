   He is my friend, yes.  But it is more accurate to refer to him as my
husband.  Benefits and all that.  I never said he wanted to delete his
character, I said he wanted to play a different class that he had more
fun playing with on a different server.  Neither of us have any desire
or need to stop playing EQ.  If I have to go into more details about how
FV is a roleplaying server, and Lenny can be the exact same character
even though he a different class, just let me know.

   Fair enough.  But this has nothing to do with what I was talking
about.  We've never stopped having fun with the game, we've just tried
different classes and found that some are more suited to our playing
style.

   Sure is.  I disagree with you on this "slap in the face" thing, but
it doesn't really matter to what I was talking about.

    Thank you for permitting this.

   Let me go back to the drinking analogy, stretched though it may be
getting.  Say that for years I have enjoyed drinking a glass of sherry
after my supper.  I don't drink enough to get drunk, it doesn't
negatively effect my life quality, I just find it enjoyable and
relaxing.  Then I go to my friend's house for dinner.  After we eat, she
offers me a glass of port.  I'm not real familiar with port, but I am
open to new things, and accept.  I find that I really like the port,
even more than I like the sherry.  The next day, when I am in my house
after dinner, I find my glass of sherry to be lacking.  I remember how
the port just simply tasted better to me.  I've just bought a full
bottle of sherry, and it seems to be a shame, but I really would much
rather just get some port and drink that from now on instead.  And to
make the analogy fit since I am on the FV server where only one
character at a time is possible on one account, let's say, I dunno, that
I live in a thimble and can only fit one bottle of wine in my house at a
time (I warned that this was getting stretched).  So.... after some
thought I pour out the sherry and get some port.  Now I am happier.  

   So I am discussing my change of habits with some friends, oh, let's
say at a wine tasting party where we like to discuss our preferences
(s-t-r-e-t-c-h).  You come to me and tell me that since I felt motivated
to pour out my sherry, I might as well have had the fortitude to just
stop drinking altogether and pull my life together for a change, like
you have.  Do you understand why we are all looking at you oddly?

   Ok.  I'll stop posting here until I am level 61 and have earned the
right to post here with the big boys.  See you till then, everyone.

Back at you.
