Actually if they are going to make a raid channel, might as well set
up "groups of groups". Have someine invite, kinda like do for a guild.
Maybe put a number in front of people name so would know what group
they are in.   Could use the chat, just like do for guildsay, prolly
use most of the same code. 

Bad thing (and I'd wager, reason they havn't done it already), what to
do if the raidleader goes linkdead?  He has to come back, reinvite 30
people?  

Should automatically pass leadership down to someone in raidleaders
sub-group

ah well
