Ye gods 2500 plat at 14?
I'm at 20 and have 50 plat...
I might have made 2500 total but cant think how I managed to piss away that
much and only have 104 fletching to show for it :)

Got my weapons from quests so no cost other than time (and death) there, and
I'm about to go start questing for some ranger armor...

But 2500 at 14 ? Egads just go buy a warrior to kill stuff for you!!!
