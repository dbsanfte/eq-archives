Do I have this right ?

Bob logs off as a level 52 Ikie Monk
Bob logs back on next day and is suddenly a level 39 Hlf elf Rng ?

That *is* the old name bug isn't it ?
Where some one else some how gets the same name as you and you log into
their char ?

Probably the ranger transfered from a.n.other server.

But a GM said that they could not help ??

That sounds odd.
