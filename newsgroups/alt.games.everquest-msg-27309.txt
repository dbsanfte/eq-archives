Well, the chat I saw blurred was guild chat (the green, anyway).  I'm
guessing that it was either non-flattering to BotS (like they have standards
to live up to!) or not germane to the fight.

I saw chat mentioning that Mistabone died.  I believe he's the GL of the
guild.  I KNOW that he's the biggest asshole on the server.
