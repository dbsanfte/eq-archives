Yeah but EQ isn't going to change now no matter what we post. I
consider this theoretical. A future game should *not* have a PoK
system if it wants to maintain its world integrity, and games that go
the way of making things easy for the player in every way possiblt
tend to be unpopular and boring.

Not everything the players think they want is actually to their
benefit.

The vaunted casual player is the bane of making a good mmorpg. What
happens when you cater to the casual player is a popular game that
everyone is bored of within weeks (for mmorpgs).

This is an example of failure of imagination. The proper answer is not
to make the world smaller, but to provide either more impetus to
people staying where they are longer and more often and making
journeys more interesting. This need to get all over the world in an
instant reeks of obsession with some kind of maximization.

That is tangential. You don't want to waste time doing anything that
isn't progressing you in some way, whatever that might be, by spending
time walking across zones. It's most likely to be because of wanting
to get experience, but it could be anything.

And I simply nod, as you are proving my point. It's not a world you
want, but a convenient way to increase your tradeskills.

Of course EQ resembles what you want rather than what I want now, so
my thoughts, as I said, are theoretical. But wise game designers will
keep this sort of thing in mind when they make the next generation of
mmorpgs.
