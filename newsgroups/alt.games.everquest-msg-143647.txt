Well, all I can think of is that you must have a serious build-up
of idio-sludge.  Perhaps you read too many of the 'HIV muppet' posts?
I'm not at all sure what'd work best to clear that out.  Hmmm, do
you have a self-cleaning feature?  Perhaps if you just spent some
time contemplating his assertions that "Clerics are easier to level
than Druids" and "Druids are poor soloers" the heat generated by the
resultant indignation would cook the sludge down to a fine powder
easily brushed off into the wastebasket?
