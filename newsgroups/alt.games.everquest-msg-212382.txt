The difference is that you have a high degree of confidence that some 
people will respond in a particular way.  You don't actually know for 
certain which ones, or even if they will.  God, on the other hand, does 
know precisely how each and every person will "choose" from the 
beginning, and in fact, created them to "choose" that way.  If you assume 
he is omnipotent and omniscient that is.
