This is precisely what mobs that run away are for.  Use your best weapons 
to beat them to running, then quickly before you accidentally kill them, 
swap in your Abandoned Orc Shovel.  Now that they're running, you only 
have to do as much damage as their regen to keep them running.  Should you 
fail to do even that much damage, a couple seconds switched back to the 
good weapons will turn them around again. I've managed to beat on the same 
running mob for over an hour this way.  It's even better, of course, if 
you can arrange for a druid or ranger to snare them every few minutes.  
Then you can go do something else and come back with higher skill. :)
