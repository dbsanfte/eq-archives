    I have had unexplainable attacked while invis events.

    The first four are the result of a bug.
    You become visible whenever you give something to an NPC (period).
    However, you do not get the "you appear" message, and the icon in your
spell effects window remains, comfortably assuring you that you are still
invisible.
    However, the Griffon sneaking up behind you, knows better... and also
seems to know that you think you're invisible.
    If you go to an exterior view, you will be able to see yourself, even
though you don't have see invis up, and your spell effects window gently
lies to you.

    Another was a vengeful whisp.  It apparently knew that I had been
smiting its brothers in NK.  It, however, felt that as the angel of whispy
vengence it would wait until I was medding, invisible, at the foot of a
guard who was distracted by the pretty light, to attack.  Right through
invis, knowing full well that I had no ability to fight back (had I one
nuke's worth of mana, that's all it would have taken).  I zoned.

    The last was the most devious, but also totally explainable.
    I was in SolA.  A goblin shaman was green to me, and thus too chicken to
attack me.  However, he could see me, and this allowed him to share his hate
list with everyone around him.  Meaning me.  This is effectively a 0 mana,
instantaneous cast of see invis for every mob within normal aggro range (and
through walls).
    This, still, didn't matter, until a Blue to Me non-casting melee goblin
of some description, wandered by.  While he couldn't see me, he could take
the hate list of the shaman, and poof, he could instantly attack me.  (I
love how invisibility doesn't actually make you invisible).
    The kicker is, that since a BTM had aggroed on me... all the little
greenies took courage from him, and joined the fight.
    So when I gated, I was busy bandaging quickly trying to fight the DOT
that that little shaman had stung me with... grrr, should have blasted it
out of its boots before it got help.
