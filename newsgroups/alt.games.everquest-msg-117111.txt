i'm still playing both D2 and EQ,  and i must caution you right now.
Forget every single solitary thing about Diablo 2. There is no
parallel between the two games. They work in ENTIRELY different
streams. Trying to compare styles between the two will only lead you
to further confusion

you can do anything in EQ really, there are no limits, you can spend
and hour sitting around casting buffs on lowbies if you want. or go do
one of the many many quests(well try anyway) or simply join some group
and xp away etc.

First of all, you should ask yourself what type of player you are?

Do you prefer to be a damage dealer?  do you prefer to be a healer?
Do you like to control the pace of the fighting?  Are you a risk
taker?  Do you like to do one thing better than anyone else, or do a
little of everything well? Do you prefer to be an auxilliary type of
player (a char that a group does not really need, but your presence
greatly enhances the group effectiveness)?  Some combination of these?

There are 3 basic types of chars.

1)  Melees.  3 "true" melee classes, plus some hybrid classes.  These
guys tank, do damage thru combat, plain and simple.

2) Healers.  These guys heal the tanks mostly.  they also have some
damage type spells, and buffs, debuffs, utility spells.  A very well
rounded group of classes to pick from, they can also be rather
effective solo classes.

3)  Int. casters.  These are your typical wizard, magician type
classes.  Most have a "pet" (like the necro), all have very powerful
offensive spell capability, and utility spells as well.

The basic structure for a group in EQ is a tank to beat on a monster,
or mob, and a healer to heal the tank.

Groups are 6 chars big (it is possible and frequent later on to have
multiple groups fighting the same area, known as a raid).

A basic 6 char group would consist of 2 tanks (one of these will be a
puller), a cleric, a "backup" healer like a shammy or druid, a bard or
chanter for mana regen, and a kind of 6th "open" spot that can be
filled by an auxillary class (necro, wizzy, rogue).

One thing VERY different from D2 is that when you are low health/mana,
there is no potion to drink.  You must sit and wait around until your
health/mana bar fill up again, which means lots of downtime.

All in all: the game is a lot "slower" than D2, but it is much much
more complex, and if you take the time to learn this game it'll be
great fun for you :)
