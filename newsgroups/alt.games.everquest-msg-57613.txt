>>> My warrior is now 25, and I was thinking I should like do some sort of
skill. <<<

I would suggest either smithing or tailoring. Since you don't list your
race, I can't say which. But if you *have* to take up a skill, take one that
will allow you to create your cultural armor. Very few people have cultural
armor (mainly because it's PITA), so you will be unique.
