... is some other Elf's treasure.

My baby leezard warrior, fighting the eternal struggle for cash to
master blacksmithing has been saving up bone chips. Thus far, a slow
market. I /auction whenever high levels are in the FoB zone raiding epic
mobs, but no luck yet. I've been asking 4 PP a stack, which I think is
fair and not a strain on a high level necro. But no luck. I'm saving a
stack for my wife's new necro there, but I have several more stacks
accumulated.

Early morning I log in at a really odd hour, almost nobody in the zone.
Some soft-skin type suddenly /auctions WTB Bone Chips. Ten Plat per
stack. He's apparently doing the faction quest with Trooper Modo near
the ruins and has more plat than time to spend hunting skellies.

KA-CHING! I now have more plat in the bank at level ten than my first
main did at level twenty. I am still amazed at the number of bone chips
I find on the vendors near the newbie area. They stack, weigh nothing,
and occasionally can make you very, very rich (in newbie terms, that
is.) Why the other newbies sell them at vendor prices is beyond me. I
may start blacksmithing by this weekend if I can find one more
sucker........ err... "customer", like that.
