You lucky bastards! We'd kill for Venril's tooth!

When I was a child (before scrounging up batwings to pay for all the
fine patchwork leather - I still have the boots) we lived in Wuoshi's
mouth, pulling teeth to lay on the ground for all the mighty people to
find. Every time we pulled a tooth, some of us would be dragged out on
his breath and torn to pieces. We pulled teeth 30 hours a day with
nothing to eat, spent the rest of our time licking Wuoshi clean with
our tongues, and when our dad came home he'd kill us all with a small
skinning rock and throw our bodies down Wuoshi's throat!
