Hence why the smart people use twin tank groups.

Do you have *any* idea of the reality of feign pulling the current game.
Obviously not.  In the majorit yof cases it is a significant down time
casue.  Down time is bad, it should always be avoided.  Having the next
mob (or three) waiting be it by mez, add tanking or simply root parking
is *always* the best way to proceed.

The experience gain from multi-tanking greatly outweighs the small dps
loss.

Kael has one of the worst XP rates i've ever encountered.  I remember
spending a few hours there doing prots before hitting CT2 and getting
more XP in 40 minutes than I'd done in the previous 2 hours.  But your
example is pointless.  There is *always* a way round any requirement for
feign pulling and in an XP situation it is usually much higher yield not
to use feign pulling.

You're missing the point (probably deliberately).

Say your model - you want a single tank in a group.  You are adding DPS
players.  You *have* a tank.  If you choose a monk over a L65 warrior
using Aggressive the majority of the time, then you are a fucking moron.
Because the warrior will be doing more damage.  That's what's so broken.
Once you have the tank slot covered, you will choose a SECOND warrior
before the first monk if you have any idea about the game mechanics.
