While the item itself sounds fairly crappy, I can't understand the thinking behind
rewarding you for buying via retail instead of downloading.

The download version means almost no overhead at all for SOE; no packaging, no CD
to print, no shipping, no wholesale price, no stocking fees...

Personally (not that I own a software company) I'd think you'd pull out all the
stops to encourage as many people as possible to buy via download, where its just a
bit of bandwidth usage you have to pay for.

Plus, instead of printing up the CD and then putting it in the pipeline so its in
consumer hands 3 months later, you could update the downloadable version right up
to the minute of release, theoretically eliminating the need to instantly patch the
thing... not that that part seems to work that way.
