I currently play a lvl 32 paladin..and a lvl 17 troll sk...Paladins as far as
goups go..i have no problem join any group..as long as theres a slot
open..maybe im not high enough to be rejected..and yes there are some people
who will say..."Paladins suck!"..if you plan of soloing you will be able to do
that until about lvl 30 or so..after that it gets tough....now the troll
sk....he is a totally tank..solo or in a group..ive soloed mine to 17 pretty
easy..soloing yellows and white pretty easy..in the long run i would think the
sk would be the powerhouse so id go that route...as for the cleric...everyone
wants a healer..but man that seems pretty boring to me...sorry
