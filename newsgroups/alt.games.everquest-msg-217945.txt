    The phrase is "brass tacks". Your version is about as good as your
analysis below.

    Already wrong. Rogues are all about damage - ATK matters most to a
rogue. AC is so meaningless to a rogue I wonder if you even play this game.

    You've missed the Accuracy +15 and the Backstab Damage mod on it, which
are the important parts, but you have it at number one so that doesn't
matter. You list it as "crafted". You do realize the no drop pattern to make
it drops off a god in Plane of Time, right?

    We don't even need to look at any of the lesser items you've listed
after this, as they don't even come close to what I've listed. Now, if you
care about +ATK, what are the best BPs available? Bidilis, Storms,
Algae/Incorporeal augmented with the Veng. III aug. So your LDoN BP is tied
with something an elemental XP group can go camp in their off time, as
opposed to spending the 52 successful adventures (at level 65) it would take
to get the LDoN BP with that augment. What if you care about HPs because
you're a slave to Magelo? Bidilis, Storms, Void, Stanos', then
Incorporeal/Farwater/Lunar. Note that at least one of the choices above
Incorporeal can be bought in the Bazaar (100 K on my server).

    You make it sound like one of them will fall into your lap. After a
month on Quellious, the number 100 player (out of 5000 that have tried the
expansion and won at least one adventure) still doesn't have 52 wins. Top 2%
of the server, not good enough after one month. Yet Joe Casual is going to
see this some time soon?

    If you can get the pattern off the god in time, that is. Considering you
can't even enter Time-B if you aren't in a raid, let alone have a hope in
hell of getting this drop, good luck on getting it without a guild.

    Considering a level 20 gets 1 point per win, I'd love to see a level 20
with over 2600 wins that hadn't levelled.

    Nobody rolls or NBGs on raid stuff. This is DKP or Officer Reward. The
item also isn't terribly rare. Coirnav has six possible drops, and drops two
items at a time. So you have roughly a one in three chance at seeing it
drop, Coirnav is up every 5 days. On average, you'd see two BPs per month if
you were clearing the spawn.

    In 2 minutes with my Bazaar mule I could get a BP better than your
unaugmented BP by walking across the Bazaar. Your BP isn't terrific until
you get the augments, which take you about as long as the BP did to get,
EACH. As for your "2 weekends" part - yes, it can be done. It takes 30 wins
on Normal at 65 to have the points for the BP, so by doing seven or eight
adventures per day for the entire weekend, two weekends straight you could
get this. And you say the guilded people have no life?

    Wow, this is quite the tangle of crap. Let's sift through it. First off,
ratio is much more important to a rogue than just delay because of the
dependence of Backstab on the DAM of a weapon. Delay has nothing to do with
double attack frequency, or crit percentage, and is actually factored out of
the "procs per unit time" computation. And frequency of damage isn't as
important to a rogue as aggregate DPS (if anything, the aggro from low delay
is detrimental). You were right about the backstab timer not depending on
DLY, though!

    Nope, we don't. The LDoN dagger, if you spend the time to augment it up,
is almost as good as these tier III weapons. It isn't as good as all the
better weapons out there, like the Mephit Talon from Earth-B, or Ifir, or
the Dagger of Distraction, or the Jagged Timeforged Blade....

    Well, they are quite common. Take the GRMK, for example. Solusek Ro
drops two things, and has five items on his loot table. So you have a 9 in
25 chance of seeing at least one GRMK drop per kill. He respawns every three
days, so in an average month of clearing him (he's surprisingly easy) you
should see three or four knives drop. All our rogues have one, and the other
Time guild was giving these to Beastlords because all the rogues had one.

    You have no idea what a rogue does, do you?

    It's already in game. It's called Time. And what Time drops can look
like, with augments on them from LDoN raids, is sick. Oh, the number of
drops per unit time is higher clearing Time than it is doing LDoN.
