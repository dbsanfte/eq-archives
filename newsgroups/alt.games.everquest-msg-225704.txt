/assist is no guarantee anyway.  I've had /assist change my target to
somebody who'd engaged an HG prior to me _after_ I hit the HG several
times.  The sequence of events was target HG, /assist, auto-attack,
several seconds of melee attack on the HG, my target switches to other
player.  /assist also fails entirely on occasion.

My favorite RM KSer on Tunare was a necro who strolled up to where I
was fighting an HG, sat down to change his spell lineup, stood and
opened up on the HG, fearing/dotting and sending in jabober, easily
KSing my mighty ultra-low DPS Paladin.  When I jumped in his shit
about it the following exchange ensued:
necro: "you were almost dead!"
me: "no I wasn't"
necro: "you used LoH!"
me: "no I didn't, and wtf difference would that make?"
necro: "pallys can't solo HGs until 55 at least"
me: "I dinged 49 last night soloing HGs"
(Note, no u's or r's or 4's or plz's or anything, I was shocked.)
He ran off and (presumably) logged right after (didn't see him with
/ all), probably embarassed as all hell.  The zone was laggy that day
and he may well have targetted me and seen my HP from several minutes
earlier or something, it's quite possible he thought he was being a
good guy and saving me from certain death.

The moral of my story?  "No good deed shall go unpunished."
