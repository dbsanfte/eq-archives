HEHE, OK yeah Consumer Reports..They know all. All I know is that my
68' Mustang convert. that I did put 8 grand into to make showroom new
 is now worth an easy 15 to 20K ,depending mind you on the buyer.( I
live in Southern California) Hell, if it was a 68" Cobra it would go
for 50 to 60K easy.

 How much do you think that honda is going to go for in 3 years let
alone 20.

And no it's not in a garage with a cover on it, I do drive it around
town.
