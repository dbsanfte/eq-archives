Well, you gotta remember, skill ups get rare after 200, so I don't know how 
many you've made, but it wasn't uncommon for me to do 40 combines to get one
skill point when I got up around 210-215 in JC.

Also, I would advise you to look into making jewelry with the LDON drops - 
especially geodes, I think until 211. The only problem is they dont sell 
back at cost to vendors, but each night on the bazaar, they sold and sold 
well, and I made plenty of dough.  Now that EQII is out there may be crap 
for demand on them.  I haven't played my chanter / JC nor any other EQI toon
since it went live. Check out gold polished quartz and gold geode rings on 
the bazaar.

You have a gem setter, right? That adds 5% to the skill, so you fail less, 
but you don't get skill ups any faster.
