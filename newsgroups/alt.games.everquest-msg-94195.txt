That is the best all around image resampler I've
seen which is quick and freeware. You just crop the 
screenshot to the size you want, resample it to another size if its
huge still (resample is much higher quality than resizing) then you go
to save as a jpeg and hit options for the percentage. 100 percent
would look about as high a quality as the original BMP while 75
percent will shrink the byte size of the jpeg A LOT while still maybe
being high enough quality.
