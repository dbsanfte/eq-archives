I work for Bellsouth DSL Tech Support. (I get to meet a lot of EQ
players at work. My favorite was a fourty-something lady (sounded like
my mother) who had four characters over 50 on Bertoxx, and two boxed a
Druid and Bard.)

As for your problem... Firstly the firewall shouldn't be stopping you,
it does interfere with some games that use non-standard ports, but EQ
isn't one of them. (I used it just fine before I added my router.) The
more important thing would be that your ready light turns red. Watch
it carefully. If it turns red about the same time you lose connection
or shortly thereafter, you have a defective modem. However if the
light does not turn red, oronly does so rarely, then what you have is
intermittent sync. Could be caused by any number of conditions. Mostly
it is RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) or a defective phone device
in the home, if it isn't a problem with the line outside your home. If
your ready light turns red regularly when you get disconnected, call
up and describe the situation, stating that you may have a defective
router. If the situation is that the ready light does not turn red, or
only does so, perhaps one time in 20 or more, then you just have
intermittent sync, call tech support and tell them that.

If you don't want to call tech support, try moving any cordless phone
bases away from your modem (Should be at least 15 feet, preferably 20
or more) and if that is not the problem, disconnect all the phone
devices in your home (remember to disconnect your Cable or Satellite
box if you can order PPV from it) and see if that stops the problem.
If it does, plug them back up one at a time and see which one causes
the problem to start again.
