Like everyone else said, you need to have nothing in your primary
melee slot and your instrument in the secondary melee slot.  Most of the
other songs don't require an instrument at all, they just work better
when you do use one.  Sonorous clouding insists that you use an instrument.

The cool thing is that now that you know this, you'll be a lot more
effective in instrument-only attacks, and you'll run about 20% faster
when you're *actually* playing your percussion instrument, rather than
just putting it in your backpack.

Have fun!
