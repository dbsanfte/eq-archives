  The figure I have heard quoted is that there is a 2% experience
bonuse for every member in the group.  So a 6 member group would be
getting a +%12 experience bonus per kill.  Though I'm not sure how
this this compounds with other bonuses (dungeon/newbie zone bonuses,
hybrid offset bonus, Firiona Vie alignment compatibility
bonuses/penalties, ect.)

  So in your example, a 600 exp mob is killed.  Assuming everyone is
equal, everyone gets 132 exp + (120 (120 * .10)).  In a 6 member
group, everyone gets 114 exp (or maybe 115, I'm not sure how the
rounding works: 100 + (100 * .12)).  So assuming the kill rate is the
same, it's not worth it to add a sixth member just for the bonus.  In
fact, it's never worth it to add another member just for the bonus. :P

  At least this is the way I THINK it works.  The people who explained
it to me before seemed fairly confident that they knew what they were
talking about.
