I've had, and seen this exact situation happen too many times.  I
could see a rogue or a monk having problems, maybe even a ranger, but
any of the tank classes will mow through three or four greens fairly
easily.

Unless I'm getting hit repeatedly by four mobs.  That makes getting a
spell off difficult.

In a dungeon, against multiple mobs, this is pretty much a casters
only option.  Or rather, they need to hope they can get far enough out
of range to at least get a gate off.

Once again, that's a situational power.  I have seen too many casters
get smeared by green shit just because they can't get a spell off, and
the same green shit a melee class would cut down with relative ease.

>You will never see a melee quad-kiting blues. 

No, and you'll only see two classes in the game do that too.  Druids
and Wizards, two classes that have only limited functionality in
groups at the high end of the game.  The other two casting classes
that can solo effectively, Mages and Necros, suffer the same problems.
While at higher levels, tanks, clerics, shaman, enchanters, even bards
are all welcome and sought after in groups.

And push comes to shove, a good exp grind group will pull in as much
experience per hour as my druid will quad kiting wyverns in CS.  And
they won't suffer the mind numbing boredom of 10 to 12 minutes of mana
regeneration after every kill.

>You will never see 6 melees in a group dropping 35+ mobs at one time.

And you'll never see casters doing that either.  That was a broken
zone, and hardly the norm.
