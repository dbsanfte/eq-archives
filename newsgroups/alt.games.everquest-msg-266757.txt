One of the things I liked in EQ1 was the faction issues between the various
starting cities.  I thought it was cool that, say, my Dark Elf had several
other cities he could go to, and several that he could go to if he worked on
faction, and a few that he could never go to (other than perhaps skulking
around under invis) (and thanks for putting a couple parts of the Wizard
epic quest in those cities, bastards at Sony!).  (I did not like the
ridiculous amount of mindless killing needed to change some of these
factions, though!)

Is there anything like this in EQ2?  If I start in, say, Freeport, and then
go over and try to visit Qeynos, will I be totally unwelcome forever
(assuming I don't want to do anything to screw my standing in Freeport), or
can I raise Qeynos faction sufficient to get in?  If I can get in, can I get
in all the way, or just in the districts outside the main parts of the city?

Same question for people who start in Qeynos and want to visit Freeport.
