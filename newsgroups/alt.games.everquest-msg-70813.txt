For the most part I agree, though you're getting sidetracked.  What Verant
said is "fine, you want your fucking money back?  Well, you can have it but
we're shutting your ungrateful ass down."   THAT is what I have a problem
with.

The responsibility you mention should be obvious to all (but isn't...people
won't take responsibility for their own actions) but not relevant in this
case.  Verant should have warned '95 users at the same time they warned the
older hardware people that money will need to be shelled out.  THEY fucked
up, and their only response is "bite me."
