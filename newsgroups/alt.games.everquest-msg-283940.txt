When I did Tipt, we skipped the first trap; you don't need to do it.
Send your team through two by two and nothing will pop.

Second trap, do it if you need the key that it gives. Our guild
leader kept one on a corpse (it's a temporary item) so we skipped it
usually.

Third, may also be able to skip, or just do it.

Jhiru: When I manaburned him, with the old 9492 cap manaburn,
it was worth 20% of his hit points. You should consider hiring
a wizard with the new Mana Blaze and at least 9k mana to do 36k
damage. Jhiru runs at low health, so it should be an easy win.
