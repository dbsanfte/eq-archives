The crude bronze is by far the easiest item to obtain, once one realizes 
that it is only found in Crushbone (for the emerald novice warrior 
armor). I could spend days gathering the other components and then make a 
quick run into CB and round up all the crude bronze I needed in a matter 
of minutes.

I guess they liken it to what was available when EQ was young. Compared 
to those days, I suppose it's pretty good stuff. The only problem is, it 
still falls way short of even lower-end stuff the average player has at 
that level.

I wonder if there would be much interest in a total nodrop (excluding 
crafted items, of course) server - kind of the reverse of FV. Mostly 
NODROP and TLC would certainly interest me. However, the current quest 
system may not be serviceable enough to support such a system. I'm also 
not sure what it would do to many areas where there are few worthy drops.
