I imagine that many players would really like the feature you describe.

I still maintain though that if you could identify all the player's
toons,
that would be a huge bonus.  The problems I've encountered I highly
doubt would be isolated to a single toon as you describe.  At least for
me,
if I had the misfortune of grouping with a bad apple, I would really
like to have
a chance of avoiding one of their alt's in the future.

I once got into it with a monk who trained our group.  We took it to
tells and
he basically told me he didn't care what rep he got as this toon he
made simply to aggravate people...  He didn't actually use the word
aggravate, it was a bit more colorful if you get my meaning.

Still, what you describe would be awesome.
