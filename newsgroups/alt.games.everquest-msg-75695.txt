Get it all the time asking for SoW, Wolf Form, Teleport etc etc. Power
Leveling is the one I hate most, like you say I strugled through the early
levels. And enjoy the game so much more beccause of it. Seems to me kids get
the game for Xmas and want to get into higer lvl's fast just coz.
Give it 2 months and they will have gone back to playing the latest Quake
based FPS ;)
