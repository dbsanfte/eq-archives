I'm wondering, if you only had the original version of EQ which does
not include the Kunark expansion, of course you wouldn't be able to go
to Kunark, but then would you be required to get the expansion in
order to see/interact with Iksar players who happened to be on the
mainland, e.g., Oasis, or would you still be able to see them without
the expansion?  

Also, if you didn't have the expansion and you happened to be in
Butcherblock Mountains, would you then only see the one dock with the
boat going to Freeport but not the other dock going to FV? (the same
thing with the Velious expansion--if you didn't have the Velious
expansion, would you then not be able to see the dock in NRO with the
boat going to Velious?)

Was just curious about this because, with the new expansion coming out
with the Vah Shir cat people, I was wondering if people without the
expansion would be able to see the new Vah Shir players/see the dock
or transporter or whatever will take players to the Vah Shir homeland?

Thanks in advance,
