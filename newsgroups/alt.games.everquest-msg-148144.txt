Level 44 Wood Elf druid.

I have been quadding in the Dawnshroud Peaks for the last 10 levels or so. 
Zelniaks are great because they're docile and don't pull others, so it's quite 
easy to round up four and only four. Also the wolves leave me alone because I'm a 
druid, so I don't get them mauling me to death.

That being said, the large zelniaks are now light blue to me and no longer give 
as great of exp. For the first yellow of this level I killed hill giants in Rathe 
Mountains. That took only a couple hours, not bad but definitely not as fast as 
quadding zelniaks. The loot is great, however, so I'm considering getting to 
level 45 by just killing giants - I'll have lots of money by then (got about 
430pp in those two hours).

What makes me hesitate to go that route, however, is that everyone else is 
already killing hill giants. At about 2am there were only 14 people in the zone 
but hill giants were still hard to come by at moments. Not a steady stream of 
pulls essentially. Unfortunately I needed to get some sleep at about 4:30am, 
because there were only 9 people in the zone then and I counted six hill giants 
up. During the day it wouldn't be worth my while to log in to kill them obviously.

And no I wasn't quadding hill giants, they're easier if I just DoT/root and then 
rest. If I am to quad, however, what is a good zone for exp that someone could 
recommend? Loot isn't so important, just exp.

Thanks.
