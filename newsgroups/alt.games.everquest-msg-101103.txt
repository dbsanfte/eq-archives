Clerics get the [Armor Piece] of the [some good character trait], ie The
Bracers of the Revenent.  Bards get the Lambant quests.  The NPCs for these
are in the foyer of the temple.  I -believe- this is where Shadow Knights
get their Darkforge armor.  Also, Enchanters have cloth armor items here.
Only Paladin armor has the "of Ro" nomenclature, but other classes have
armor quests there.  Also, the Warrior's Crafted armor is pretty much Ro
class, even though it's got through the Centaurs in S. Karana (at least, I
consider it to be Ro class.  Same approx level to get, a bit easier to
quest, and a bit better gear, though).

I had a hard time bringing myself to kill them.

Yeah, I've got to beat up some minotaurs before I go back to Sol A for the
boots and vembraces.

I haven't killed my faction yet.  I will soon.

Goodbye to the bewildered yestersday.
This feelign that gushes out.
Let's make a regrowing flower blossom.
Memories are always a sweet place to run away.
But let it go to live for tomorrow.
The time for celebration will come, with both hands extended.
Both hands raised.
