Since you apparently never read the first post I made, here is the quote
that you seem to have taken out of context.

"In our family, we have certain members that are anal about things...  My
niece for example is the most anal Christmas person I've ever seen.  Her
tree has to be perfect, her lights just right, every decoration in it's
place.  We affectionately call her the Christmas Nazi.  You seem to be her
equivelent in this regard...  The Everquest Nazi."

I am indeed quite a reasonable person, I just think that some people are a
bit anal about the way things HAVE to be (apparently just because they say
so.).  If you feel you must discuss me, I would, in the future, appreciate
you actually reading the entire post and not simply picking up on one word
that you find offensive.

Thank you.
