Is the map height filter on? Do you have blank versions of the maps as
well saved in there - I found the cartography tool could make a conflict
occur. THose are two quick fixes.

Side question - do you have the LoY expansion, we had someone in the guild
grab the maps and try to use them but didnt have LoY....you can only use
the map tool in certain places without that expansion as I understand it.
