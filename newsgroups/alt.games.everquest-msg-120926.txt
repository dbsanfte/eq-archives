Tried Neriak?

OK, serious. Where? You are a Dark Elf, when you chose the race you chose
one of the most despised and feared races on Norrath, only Iksar are above
you on the most hated list. If you chose agnostic (a luxury Iksar cannot
afford) then you are likely Dubious to humans but still KoS to Elves and
Dwarves (and possibly halflings, not sure, I had already killed the ones in
Nek forest before testing those waters) so, Where?

Freeport

W. Freeport, follow north wall (left as you face the city) there is a secret
entrance in the wall and a DE poison merchant will buy from you.
The merchants in the Tunnel, Shady and friends, will also buy and sell to
you.
To become (more)popular with merchants in the Commons, kill Orcs (this will
also help your faction with the Paladins in N FP)

Qeynos

There is a merchant inside the Gates of Nrth Qeynos (on the left as you
enter) who will buy and sell to anyone.
Of course, you will need the guards to tolerate you first (Agnostic's will
be dubious but non agnostics will have a harder time) kill Gnolls for
faction in Qeynos.

Luclin

You can by and sell in the Bazaar on Luclin but there are 4 factions for
trading in Shadow Haven and everyone starts Dubious with them.

Velious

Thurgadin, You should be Dubious at worst there, possibly apprehensive (can
buy and sell) if agnostic.

 Kunark

I believe you will be apprehensive to the Outpost, on VS faction and not any
of the normal Dark Elf ones but a few sarnak war braids changes this pretty
quickly. Forget FV as a trading post.

Choosing an evil race means you have to work for faction, you don't
necessarilly have to be or act evil but you will always shoulder this burden
of hatred and misstrust when entering a new land, on the plus side you look
cool ;ï¿½)

CF
Was using creative license when I said Dark Elves being the second most
hated race (Iksar are the first) as both Ogres and Trolls probably have a
much harder time of it.
