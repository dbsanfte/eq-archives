Never left but did play it. Nothing new there. Not a bad game just the
same game as EQ. Same static MoB pops, wandering around, hack, kill.
It is defiantly a game for people who get their panties in a bunch
over particular things in EQ. Quest generate much more exp, all
classes can solo, tight economy ect... But same, snare spells, breeze
type spells ect....

In the end I was turned off because it is a lonely game. Hard to find
groups, at times even people (what happens when everybody can solo).
Didn't feel like starting over again with low level characters to play
EQ with rule tweaks and better graphics. Oh and that "less down time"
means the game gets boring even quicker as you can now, kill, kill,
kill, faster to come to the conclusion that the repetitive nature of
the game bores you. As for going and doing your skills, better have
money so kill, kill, kill.... As for quests to get money, run through
area A, jump through hoop B, talk to NPC C. Been there done that,
**yawn**

I'm getting the feeling I'll have to try Star Wars or Planetside for
something new and refreshing in the online arena. All the fantasy
games are a like and just offer different rule sets, maybe a different
looking character, but the same play.

Just my 2 copper pieces and I can't drop them either. :-P
