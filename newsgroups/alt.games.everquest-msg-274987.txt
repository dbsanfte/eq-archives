That may be in part because of the devs changes to make the game more
'solo friendly'. Now, many people are soloing yellows, oranges and the
new 'enraged'  mobs instead of grouping, so in the end it hurts the
people who like to group (and which is the base of the EQ population)
because it gets harder to form groups, and it's a domino effect, if you
have a group of 2 trying to get more, since you have to wait longer,
the members already there get bored and decide to go solo.
Luckily I'm in a guild where everyone is about my level (actually I was
much higher but created a new toon just so I could play with them)
I feel for you man, I heard the news about them trying to make the game
more 'solo friendly', and knew it would hurt the guildless
'non-soloers' players
