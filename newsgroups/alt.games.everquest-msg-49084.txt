>> Well i know there was a white to me guard in E. FP. <<

Using his criteria, the guards in East Freeport don't count, as they are
"corrupt". The EFP and WFP guards are the bad guys, and the NFP guards are
the good guys. Same in Qeynos, there are corrupt guards and good gaurds (not
sure which are which though)

>> You might try misty thicket <<

Guards in Misty Thicket in High Pass Hold are also "good". Unfortunately, at
your level I don't think they are any guards you can kill. Gain a few more
levels, let your hatred simmer, then take 'em out.

BTW, the little halfings are probably not the best ones to attack. They have
an *incredible* agro range, and IIRC, they are never found alone.
