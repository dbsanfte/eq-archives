}So is that all hitsmode was about?  The ability to drop a mobs name from the
}melee box?

It had a lot of different options, and a lot of ways to take advantage of 
it.  Before /hitsmode, I'd had melee messages of all kinds switched off so 
I could actually read stuff before it scrolled off the screen... but with 
hitsmode, I could sacrifice a tiny amount of screen real estate to create 
a tiny box that would appear only if something was actually pounding on 
me, and another one that would only appear if I decided to work on my ub3r 
l3e7 Chanter melee skillz, so I could tell if I was actually hitting the 
mob, and eventually I added a box for other's hits only that actually said 
who hit what, so I could find out who was breaking my mezzes. :)  Having 
it divided up among 4 windows meant I could actually catch the important 
messages before they got away and I had to mess with the scrollbar thingy.
It also seemed to help that I could put those little windows in diffeent 
spots on the screen from my main chat window.
