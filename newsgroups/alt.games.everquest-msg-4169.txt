There is the official Sony site, www.everquest.com, which may or may
not answer your questions.

Hey now, none of that. Females are every bit as capable as males.

Your understanding is correct. I personally bought the game when it
was released two years ago, and paid $40 for it. Frankly, I consider
that a bargain. I've seen people mention here lately that it can be
bought for $20 or less, if you shop around.

It is set in a fantasy world that is unrelated to our world. In
Norrath, magic works, monsters exist, and all your favorite elements
of fantasy novels can be found.

There are dragons in the game, but as a player you are limited to one
of many more-or-less humanoid forms.

There is a tutorial that comes with the game to teach you the basic
mechanics of walking, fighting, spell-casting, and so on. Once you've
gone through that, a couple of hours in-game should make you
comfortable with how to play.

But bear in mind that this game is enormous. Huge. After two years of
playing, there are countless places in the game where I've not yet
been, and magical items of which I've not even heard. Realistically,
you can expect to be learning the game as long as you play it.
