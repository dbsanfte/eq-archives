Lets see, I just spend the 10K pp I just got to get my rogue's 
poison making to 158, and that was with vendor bought 
ingredients... With plat I have earned by camping for diamond 
dust, I have also gotten my gnome tinker skill to 164 [next 
serious amount of plat will be to get it to 175, then I need to 
farm stuff from PoI to work with]

What rob a newbie? did you miss me saying that I also share the 
giant camp, but that most people dont want to sit on their asses 
for the 5 hours between spawns? If people show up and are there 
when the giants pop, any giant I am not killing is up for grabs 
if you can tag it and kill it. I regularly heal and buff people 
who are around me and not grouped with me, and I share camps. If 
*you* start by telling me that I am KSing you on a camp location 
I have had my ass in for the past 8 hours, and you have been 
there less than half an hour, I will tell you off...if *you* cant 
get to a spawn by the time I kill mine, and tag it, then it 
*isn't* your kill now, is it?

I dont get squat from farming plat, I get my tradeskills up, and 
I can buy equipment and spells so when my in game friends log in 
and want to go do something, we can go do something fun and not 
have to always be looking at getting drops to sell in bazaar.

Hm, 19 months, well over the 500 resumes, applications and 
interview mark. I live fairly out in the sticks, and many jobs 
that I am qualified for are 50+ miles away one way. Many 
companies at that distance will not consider hiring someone that 
lives that distance from them [despite my stellar attendance 
records at a company 75 miles one way distance] No, I cant work 
where I am on my feet, broke my back and am glad not to be in a 
chair, but I can't be on my feet for more than 10 to 15 minutes 
at a time without serious problems cropping up. I will not 
babysit, kids and I *really* don't see eye to eye, and I cant 
lift small children [unless they are under 5 lbs, and I don't 
think mothers of preemies in the hospital really want me to come 
to the hospital and babysit...] The eastern half of connecticut 
is not a good place to be handicapped and out of work=\ 
especially with the call centers for the insurance industry being 
sent to the south and even out of the country, and military 
spending decreases forcing closures and cutback in the local 
companies...

Hell, if it wasn't so abbhorent to me, I would go to work for IGE 
about now. Serious broke is not fun. Our entertainment 
expenditures are cable tv, cable modem and eq. I am *very* glad 
hubby happens to also play eq...it is something we can do 
together that has a minimal cost.
