Well I *HAVE* played both games (still have an active WoW account in
fact because a lot of my old EQ friends play it) and I've found WoW
combat much easier and more straightforward.

How to solo a mob as a Hunter:

Send pet in.
Shoot.

Two keys.

How to solo two mobs as a Hunter:

Send pet in on mob A.
Shoot mob B.
Set trap.
Trap mob B.
Shoot mob A.
Wait until pet kills mob A.
Send pet in on mob B.
Heal pet (usually not required, mind you)
Shoot mob B.

My Hunter isn't level 70 purely and simply because I don't play him
often enough due to the fact that - and whisper this - levelling him
is unchallenging and things I find unchallenging bore me.
