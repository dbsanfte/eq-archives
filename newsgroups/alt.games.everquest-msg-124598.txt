Ok, I need a quick lesson in ranger buffs.

Tonight I (54 cleric) was grouped with a 56 ranger who was casting,
I'm pretty sure he said, 10 buffs on himself (in addition to my cleric
buffs of course).  Couple that with the 2 bard buffs he would get
during battle and the miscellaneous enchanter buff, and I couldn't
land a Celestial on him.

I tried to convince him to get rid of at least one so I could
Celestial him, but he wouldn't.

Anyway, my question is: 10 buffs????  I really, really find it hard to
believe they're *all* that useful.

Thoughts?
