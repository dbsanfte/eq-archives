Ranger 58.
Kinda pisses me off.  I will loose exp in the patch.  All the exp I
have gained will be rewritten to lvl 58 @ 58,000 exp points instead of
lvl 58 @ 116,000 exp points.  So when I die I will loose more exp.  I
have to say this is a rip.  The exp loss was capped at lvl 42 exp loss
or something, but beings I had so much exp, dieing wasn't that big of
a pain as it will be now.  Of course I won't be able to keep the exp
That I had already earned.  Tell me how this is fair.
