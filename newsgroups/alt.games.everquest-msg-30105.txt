Not that this really answers your question but just as a heads up...I played
AC for a little over a year and once you get past the setup of controls and
the no compass and no map to see exactly where you are, you will love the
game.  I've only been playing EQ for a little over a week and am upset that
I even wasted my time playing AC.  Both games have their good and bad
points...but from what I've seen EQ is very party driven and every character
has his own role within the party.  It's a great game and I can't wait to
start partying.
