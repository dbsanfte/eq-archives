I spent a lot of pp getting research skill very high.  And spent a
huge amount of time trying to find the components.  Then all of a
sudden, it didnt matter anymore.  Hit 50.

My suggestion is just forget it.  You will be surprised at how fast
research skill becomes completely useless.

As you level, you will be able to buy the spells you cant research. 
Either buy or get as loot drops.  So many casters hit 50 and say argh!
 What a waste of time!

With SoL there is supposedly a general spell researching skill, usable
for all caster spells.  Given that, it might now make sense to work on
spell research. But know very little about this.
