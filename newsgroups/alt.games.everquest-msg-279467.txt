I don't know about your server, but on Quellious the feature is almost
completely unused.  Do you think ANYBODY is paying for a second account to run
a buyer in addition to their seller?

I suspect you're in the ballpark about the reason they don't allow offline
selling - it inflates their usage numbers, and there are people who maintain
a merchant account that they leave on all the time.

I suspect the other reason is that they're afraid of a more open market.
