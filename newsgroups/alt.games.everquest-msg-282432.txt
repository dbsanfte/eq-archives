That bit's easy.

Use hotbar #3 or #4 which are vertical, change the hot key settings in the
key mapping options to refer to hotbar #3 instead.  You'll not notice any
difference once that's done.

Yep there's a core XML file which lists what should be present and the old
stuff doesn't have it.

The guild window has a new tab with a website, guild channel and another
field, you're not missing anything critical.

The new inventory window includes the Item XP bit in the middle from DoD
but again you're not missing anything if you don't have DoD.  Erm, can't
remember if the audible alert dialog works in the old one?

Anyway, to solve 99% of your UI Blues,

1. start using hotbar #3, and change the key mappings for the normal keys
to refer to this one.

2. create a directory \program files\sony\everquest\uifiles\mygui
(obviously mygui can be anything you like).

3. copy \program files\sony\everquest\uifiles\default_old\gemicons*.* to
\program files\sony\everquest\uifiles\mygui\ (that will fix your spell gem
icons)

4. If you want the old buff icons as well, they are spells01.tga to
spells07.tga just do the same with those (i.e. copy from default_old to
your own custom UI directory).

Now start the game, and do /loadskin mygui 1

That will make no changes to any of the window layouts or feature-set, and
will ensure that when Sony patches you get all the changes.  The only thing
you might miss out on, but it's not likely, is changes/additions to the
icons you've copied over.

One thing this will result in, is an ugly spell bar but with the old icons,
because they also changed window_pieces02.tga to have a new 'shape' for the
spell gem button.  If you like, you can copy window_pieces02.tga as well
and retain the old spell bar look but it might affect how other bits of the
interface look as well, I'm not sure - I hacked my own copy of
window_pieces02.tga to include the new stuff, and the old stuff at the same
time, which sort of works ;)
