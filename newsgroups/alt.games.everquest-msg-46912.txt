This would qualify as a Stupid Post of the Week, unfortunately, Everquestdabest
in ineligable for the grand prize. You can't lobotomize a brain that isn't
there.

And for those of you thinking I'm being "scathing" just because I can, a simple
search on google.com produced plenty of results, plus a quick look at the patch
history explains it all in detail.

"The first issue addressed in the Warrens is the problem of higher level
characters competing with lower level characters for loot on lower level
creatures. To address this issue, in the Warrens, a group that 'outclasses' a
particular foe will not receive any loot that is MAGIC, LORE, or NODROP. All
other loot will drop. 'Outclassing' a foe is defined as having a group makeup
such that no one in your group receives experience from the kill. This can
happen if, for instance, the foe is 'green' to all group members, or if the
group makeup is of such a wide level range that the system determines the fight
was unbalanced using regular experience rules."
Yeah...there's that little shard of mercy in me somewhere....need to get that
taken care of.....
