Three times in recent weeks, I have had a member of a LDoN adventure pull
out in the middle of the adventure because 'my guild needs me'.   Two of
those times we failed the adventure because we were shorthanded (failed by a
few minutes, so it would have been possible to win with a full group).

Two possible explainations occur to me.
1) The guild puts such high demands on their members that they are expected
to drop everything and come when called.
2) The player just wanted to leave and put the blame on the guild so we
wouldn't blame him.

Either way, my opinion of the player and the guild is tarnished by his
actions.

I think a 'good' guild should make it clear to their members that they are
NOT expected to leave a current group in trouble, just to come to the rescue
of a guild member or a raid.

In an adventure especially, there is so much going on that there is no time
for guild chat.  The same would be true of flagging runs and other fast
paced events.  Personally, I turn guild chat off when I enter an adventure
so I can't be distracted until I leave the dungeon.
