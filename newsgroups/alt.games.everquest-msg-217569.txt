I disagree,

People have always been begging/buying/ and whoring clarity. LONG before 
extended duration foci, and KEI. Even 45 minutes of regular old clarity 
was worth it to a soloing caster, and even some grouped casters.

At that point, before PoK and 4 hour KEI, the whores tended to situate 
themselves in key busy xp-grinding zones, or rotate through the key busy 
xp-grinding zones peddling their services.

I can't honestly recall a time before clarity whores, beyond the first 
few weeks after initial release.

KEI's duration is a joke, to an extent. Like mage summoned items... you 
don't need to group with them... you just find someone to equip/buff 
you, and then leave them behind. I'd like to see some of the high 
duration buffs redone as a group buff duration thing... lasts the Enc 6 
hours, and everyone he's grouped with same, or he can cast it on others, 
but then it only lasts 30 minutes. Still excellent if your grouped with 
the enc, still highly usuable as a raid buff (where the enc is present 
to refresh as needed), but not so much as a powerleveling tool, unless 
you can get the enchanter to actually come with you.
