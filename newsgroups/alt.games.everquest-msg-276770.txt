There were definitely some bad apples on KB, but overall the population
was great.  But I heard that people were being /petitioned after the
merge for simply using /auction (to sell stuff!) or /ooc (to talk out
of character!).  It seems there has just been a huge culture clash
between two servers that treat their chat channels differently.  I'm
sure it has been blown way out of proportion on both sides though.

Game on,
