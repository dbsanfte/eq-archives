Tough one.  I'd call it an exploit but would be shocked if anyone ever got
in trouble for it.  Like you said, it's not the pathing that keeps you
healthy, it's the fear.

I think it's an exploit because you can stand around blasting him without
going through the annoyance of running close enough...pausing long
enough...then casting.  The Fear doesn't have to stick as long as it would
if you were wasting time running and pausing to avoid interruption so less
mana is needed than SHOULD be needed and there's less chance of him taking a
swing at you if he doesn't live long enough to break Fear.

But I doubt if I'd feel too guilty about it if I were in that situation.
