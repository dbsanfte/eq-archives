Well, I have a chanter at 18, and I think that she has come into her own. 
She has all of the class-defining spells, and most groups these days are 
alts of high levels or easily trainable to understand /assist.

Playing a chanter as you describe is admittedly not too hard. Currently, 
however, I have been charming while breezing, hasting, and mezzing. All 
told it is a  hell of a lot more fun than, say, a cleric. Chanters are 
definitely harder than a monk, a warrior, a druid, or a magician. I have 
not played any other classes, so cannot comment on them.
