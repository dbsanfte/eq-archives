You do sound like a git, and quite clueless, but that's ok as we were =
all (and many still are) like that.  I've been playing a rogue now for =
awhile (level 35 iirc).  I wasn't quite sure how to play a rogue either, =
but have grouped with many as my other character (50 cleric).

In a group situation, all we really do is look at the ass end of the =
beast and pound the backstab button when available.  If the thing agros =
on us, use the Evade button (that you must manually setup) to quickly =
stop attacking, hide and then start attacking again.
