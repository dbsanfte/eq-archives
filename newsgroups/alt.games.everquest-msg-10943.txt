The difference is you are bringing in OUTSIDE real world money
influence. Do we really want people earning a profit for playing a game?
People do all kinds of crazy shit for money. Do we really want people
farming items for real cash? Or generating tons of cash with trade skills
to flood the market in EQ spoiling what little economy there is?

I know if I needed money it would be easy to sit in front of my computer
endlessly clicking away at making trade items to generate platinum to sell. And
that I would NOT do just for the fun of it in the game. Its generating platinum
in game that would not normally be generated in the normal course of play.
That is bad, and why Verant has rightly made it against the rules.
