Thats a good point, I tend to think in terms of healer mana (the
result of having run each of the three major healing classes, and
a healer as my first real main), and an OOM healer is very close
to a dead MT and that tends to chain into a wipe.  But OOM isn't
the worst thing if there's no emergency and your job isn't
crucial to whether the party stays alive.  Certainly it is
interesting to note that OOM doesn't cost you mana regen (which
I've already  concluded is the key element) while FM does.  

But if two people are FM while a third is OOM, there's probably
some adjustment in order in the group; someone isn't (aren't)
pulling their weight, and someone is leaning too hard on the go
button; after all, I've already pointed out in the long run he
won't be getting any more mana back for being OOM than he would
for being at 50M or 80M.
