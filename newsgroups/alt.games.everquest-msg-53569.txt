Many years ago, I had a friend in the adult industries.  She found
that there are quite a few people out there who enjoy being
abused.  Interesting thing is, they found that rather than pay
someone to abuse them, all they need to do is act like jerks,
and they get abuse for free.

Beggers do not deserve ridicule.  /ignore them, thats the
cruelest thing you can do to them.  If you don't want to be
quite that cruel, you can politely say I never give to beggers,
I advise going out, killing enemies, and looting their bodies.

On the other hand, if you want to be a little -more- cruel,
/ignore them and then /shout Free (whatever the nice loot
you were thinking of giving them) at the (wherever you happen
to be) to the first (their class and level) to poke me.
