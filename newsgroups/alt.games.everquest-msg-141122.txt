level is all important, and determines your earning potential in the long
run.  if you can level fast, definitely go that route.  the faster you
level, the faster you can get to mobs that drop uber stuff.

you could also optionally hunt monsters that drop items you want / need.
for instance I hunted alot of my initial items myself for my enchanter, from
polished bone bracers from beholder eye critters to quests like the 10 int
( uber at the time ) stien.  you should look up some and do them, especially
when your bored with the leveling treadmill.

I guess as a last resort you could blow your money on items, but eventually
you will want to upgrade, and having your money invested in items isn't a
wise investment with items constantly getting lower and lower in price.

you should also get friendly with an enchanter so you can get freebie KEI's.
You can port, so you can go to him for them.  Of course, this will require
finesse and charm.  I have a druid who I KEI for free pretty much, since I
get ports also for no cost, so it works out.
