SoR is a mage ability that summons a fairly low level pet
that sits in one spot and casts a bolt spell for 30/45/60
seconds.  Problem is that the pet is so low (49ish?) that
the spell is completely resisted by most PoP mobs.  SoR
went on the "Don't bother with it" list for mages pretty
quickly after it came out.
