Checking around on playerauctions and IGE it seems the prices to buy PP and
to sell characters has tanked since SWG came out.  Are the servers really as
dead as it seems?  I quit a few months ago.  When I left IGE was paying $215
for 100K of PP on my server and selling it for $269.  Now they are only
willing to pay $100 and are selling it for $195.  This looks pretty much the
same across all of the servers.
