    Is there a backlog of players all being pressured by their guilds to get
their warrior epic? Are guilds becoming mortal enemies over repeated fights
in Emerald Jungle? Is a guild without warrior epics at a distinct
disadvantage when it comes to raiding? The two are very different. Saying
"epics is epics" misses the point of why the cleric epic is causing
problems.

    If you're gonna go for it, go all the way, baby! :-)

    No, that's the melees in my guild. I mentioned that to point something
out: my guild's warriors all have better than 14/20 with 500 DoT proc. That
means that there's a LOT of weapons out there better than the warior epic,
since that 14/20 weapon (Ichorflow off Grieg, BTW - and if you had the
numbers I bet you could learn to take him down) is better than the warrior
epic. The intent was not to say "warrior epic sux, d00d" but just to point
out how many weapons exist that are better than it. All that time folks
spend watching EJ for Sev might be better spent watching DN for Vaniki, for
example.

    Are Warlords like that able to gather the raid support to get a warrior
epic? If they can, then they can gather the raid support to get the
alternatives. Assuming they raid for the drops and don't purchase them - I
know some warriors take that route to the epic, especially on servers where
one guild uses green scales as a cash cow. The alternatives generally cannot
be purchased. :-(

    Swiftblade of Zek. Fleshgrinder. Ichorflow. Hammer of Battle.
Skybreaker. Ribcracker. (Piercers) Shadowheart. Willsapper. All things that
someone capable of doing the other parts of the warrior epic should be able
to do, based on what I see one of the other guilds on my server (that can
just farm HoT for armour) doing. That's not counting anything that might be
in Veeshan's Peak, which in theory is doable but I feel in practice isn't.
It also isn't counting anything with a worse ratio that the Blades of
Tactics or Strategy, or anything with a better ratio but slower delay (I
tried to keep the "taunt weapon with good defensive numbers" in mind when
looking at stuff).
