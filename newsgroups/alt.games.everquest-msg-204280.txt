I doubt going to Velks or KC is going to help. Youre probably timing your
heals correctly for a place like KC or Velks, but of course thats too late
in the planes. Until the mob gets slowed you just need to start casting much
earlier. A good slower will announce when the mob is slowed, so you know
when to go out of panic mode. Ive been in groups where the cleric starts
casting CH as soon as the tank starts getting beat on. You will find a
warrior main tank will result in later slows (due to lack of agro). Maybe
throw a celestial whatever on the MT just prior to combat.

I would also question the deaths of 2 casters being your fault. Maybe they
should learn to manage agro a bit. Just a thought.
