I'd heard of that, and its a similar idea; people who have high enough 
limits to buy what they want at a camp, but have already spent the 
points they earned there on something else, using plat (or keying to POP 
zones) to buy adventure points.

This was the reverse, I had the points but not the spending limit.

While what I wanted was at Takish, I wonder how much more difficult it 
would have been to find someone with a 760+ limit at Deepest Guk (I 
currently have a 22 point limit there, and I've always gone whereever 
people wanted to go, so I'm guessing few people want to go to Deepest Guk!)

Splendid
